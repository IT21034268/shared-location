3,Okay for the Price,"This vest is not bad for what I paid, but it is not ""satin""--it's seems to be some sort of poly blend."
2,The nail in the coffin,"After BR started to add a little variety (Against The Grain - their best, IMHO) to the onslaught (Suffer, No Control), they put out this tepid album which begins a succesion of boring, formulaic punk albums with decent lyrics. While songs like ""Generator"" and ""Fertile Crescent"" are certainly good songs, the album as a whole just doesn't impress."
3,DS Volume 21,"Finally, the end of the ultra-boring, series-killing 1970PT story. The 1841PT is superior in every way to this dull, snooze inducing PT story. For all who watch the series, wake up and get ready for a much better plot coming up in volume 22. The Dark Shadows 'train' is finally back on track in volume 22 and, except for a few moments here & there, is excellent until the end."
4,This was pretty cool...,"I know that everyone dogged this album (even me at one time), I listened to it again and I found it to be, well, a pretty nice cd. I mean, the harmonies are A+, even if this is a poppy offering. And, the message of God's love for us is still there. I mean really, do they have to do an acapella album for it to be likable? At any rate, this was a really nice offering by Take 6 and I enjoyed it. So, there!"
3,Almost,"Though this album didn't meet the standards of Take6's usually outstanding work, nonetheless you still get three good wholesome songs in ""Song-A-Song,"" ""Delilah,"" and ""Do Right."" Every runner joggs off the track once in a while. I just can't wait for their new stuff."
1,Bad lessons :(,"These is beastly, useless DVD. Instructors don't count at all. They dance only cumbia constantly. Some of instructors can't dance salsa! They have no style. Don't buy this video, you will not learn salsa. I think to return these DVD."
1,What book is this?,"This copy of Human All Too Human was 50 pages total and nothing like any other translation. Don't bother with this one, many others are better."
3,"Human, All Too Human","I received a brand-new copy of the book quickly. I was not satisfied with the book itself, but that is not the seller's fault! :) The book had no footnotes! But it was both part I and II of the text, while the library copy I read (this book was a gift to my wife) was only part I."
3,The beginning of the end.,"7th Heaven - The Complete Seventh Season begins to crumble in terms of floods of new characters and storylines. Ashlee Simpson joined the cast and it was not for the better, not only can she not sing a note - she can't act either. She plays Simon's new nosy but caring girlfriend. Matt and Mary are absent throughout this season so we are forced to watch Ruthie become a spoiled brat, oh the humanity! There are only a handful of good episodes, the rest of the seasons are not even worth purchasing."
4,Gift for a fan.,I bought this for a gift for someone who is a fan of the show there were no complaints given.
3,The Cliff Notes of military history,"The ""Essential Histories"" series from Osprey could easily be compared to the Cliff Notes series. They'll give you a nice introduction to a topic you are not familiar with, but no real depth. Most volumns are under 100 pages; therefore, don't expect many ""man in the trenches"" stories.This series tends to run into problems when the time periods stretch out. Nearly 150 years is a bit difficult to present in such a small book. The more length in years, the more background necessary for items not related."
5,Nice!,"You can't go wrong with Gene, if you like a read with much depth of characters and wonders of nature. Clean, pure and lovely!"
1,OK! Be a sap,"The Bros. Wachowski (aided by the secret people who control things) take the basic story line of the life, both past and future (as recorded in Revelation, Daniel, and the 4 Gospels) of Jesus, rewrite the characters a bit, add some great special effects, add LOTS, and I mean LOTS of schmootz, and even more creative arrogance (and license), and shake it, up until it just barely looks like plagiarism, take out a ton of difficult to deal with matter, garnish with contemporary nonsense, and voila...You have The Matrix.These guys get rich and laugh all the way to the bank while you work your 9 to 5 and believe with all your heart that they are geniouses.If you just have nothing more to waste money on, go for it, but understand that the Hollywood crowd has discovered new ways to milk BILLIONS from the very foolish viewing public."
3,A disappointment,"This is one of the introductory books in Harlequin's new Flipside line that promises to be ""fun, witty, unexpected"". I liked the premise of the book: Corrine decides to teach her two timing boyfriend a lesson by dumping him and then going on a two week vacation so he can see what life is like without her and beg her to come back to him. Corrine's best friend Matthew is in love with Corrine so he show up on her vacation determined to win over her heart before she goes back to the sleazebag. Matthew is a great character and could win over any woman. There were some amusing scenes when Matthew and Corrine were trying to get together and everything went wrong. The problem I had with this book is that I didn't like Corrine. She was to self-centered and I couldn't see any reason that Matthew would love her. She was very condescending toward Matthew for most of the book. The book is OK but I can't highly recommend it."
5,wish there were more like this,"Would like to see more like this for all continents and countries. Too difficult for most toddlers, but good for ages 4-12."
5,Great puzzle,We purchased several of these puzzles for our 3 year old son. He loves them. The pieces are large and sturdy. We like that each country is its own piece. It's a great way for kids to learn geography and develop spatial coordination. We have all of the continents that are available. We highly recommend.
2,BAD DESCRIPTION>>>THIS IS ONLY FOR REAR WINDOWS,"The order arrived in a huge box, with only two pieces of rear window deflectors.Dissapointing. Had it been mentioned that it is only for rear window, i would ordered accordingly. I expected it to be a set of our, two for front and two for rear windows."
3,I Remember The 80's,"When a song by Ratt or late-period Journey comes on the car radio, do you roll down the window and pump your fist in the air? If you do, you'll probably do the the same thing with this book. It's all about the good old days, back when shoulder pads were huge and journals like ""October"" really meant something. But unlike ""October,"" Frech Theory never dies -- it just glistens with more and more nostalga. And like any good hard rock ballad, this book is dripping with more nostalga than a freshly glazed donut. But you were expecting this, right? It had to be done with Frenchness -- just letting it sit there and get more stale would have been so... unglazed."
2,Did not work for us,"My husband has terribly oily skin and we were using Neutrogena oil face wash (which worked amazingly well!) but they stopped selling it, so we tried this. It does not control his oil at all ... it literally does nothing. His face is back to being shiny and constantly oily.Bummed :("
2,"oily, gritty finished product","i'm a big fan of hodgson mill products (we love their bread mixes, i use their pancake mixes.) i'm not afraid of whole grains (i mill my own grains, wheat, kamut, rye, barley) and i even put milled flax seed in my (home made) yogurt. I've been a baker for 35 years and love to try new recipes.i had high expectations for this product but was very disappointed by the results: the box calls for too much fat and the baked brownies have a distinctly oily feel in the mouth. I can enjoy the grittiness and the chocolate flavor is fine but i would caution buyers against the results if following the instructions on the boxone of the problems is that the coarse texture of the mix does not allow the fat to be absorbed well.i will go back to making whole wheat brownies from scratch. a little bit of time required... a little less convenient but brownies being a treat (and comfort food), the texture should be right :)"
3,Not extraordinary,"I was hoping for a health substitute for white flour brownies. It's OK, but not what I would serve to company. I substitute canola oil for the butter or margarine and that may have been the problem. Of course, I wound up eating them all anyway."
3,Sterling Silver?,"This toe ring is exactly as pictured and fits beautifully on your toes with one draw back, I found that this particular toe ring is NOT sterling silver as listed. Most sterling silver is 925 grade but this toe ring is NOT.In fact after just one day of wearing, by night I found the toe ring had turned my skin a green-blue color, resembling a bruise. This only happens when the metal is not genuine sterling silver.Buyer beware!"
2,"Boring to read, mediocre test questions, lowers confidence.","I started PMP study reading this book. It is almost as boring (and lengthy) to read as the PMBOK, endless repeats on what the inputs and outputs are. The test exams at the end of each chapter are frustrating - and the given answers often still leave you puzzled.I changed to Rita Mulcahy's book - which was a MUCH easier read with a lot more practical and useful information. She also doesn't focus much on memorization, but understanding. The sample questions are very good and the answers give you a very good understanding.After successfully passing mock exams, I tried the mock exam included on the CD with the KIM Heldman book. The questions were very lengthy and difficult to read (worse than the real PMP exam) and I didn't manage to get a good score on this mock exam - which was really bad for my confidence close to the exam. I decided to not look at it anymore and I passed the exam."
2,Not as expected,"These came out smaller than I expected, but the taste as not as good as I thought it should be. Second time, I added a couple of items, which helped a little, but it is hard to find a great tasting boxed muffin mix. I thought it would save me time, but I like my own muffins better. My husband thought they were okay, but not great."
3,"easy to learn, but with mistakes.","Helps you to know some of the visual studio, if you want to do a project, this book will not help. it has only an introduction for each part of the studio."
2,lots of rubbish,This book is big and full of rubbish. The examples are not useful and you have to read lots of pages to get a little bit of explanation which it could have been done with few lines. I would not recommended to anybody
1,"Very, very disappointing","I've loved many of his books (CLASS being the best in my opinion) - but this book is not sociology, this is not scholarly work. It is nothing but a random collection of personal remarks and memories about diverse uniforms, and ENDLESS descriptions in minute details of each feature of said uniforms.Rarely read such a boring book. Let's also be clear: It borders on the sexually fetishistic.Nothing about the uniform as a social signal, as a social institution etc. Just a catalog of uniform descriptions and Fussell's own fascination with brass buttons. Pass this book if you're expecting sociology."
3,Good info - brief,"I was really looking for more info on how to prevent biting and aggressive behavior. The digging info was great. Just wish there was more info about real naughty behavior like potty ideas, dominance, yucky behavior - nuisance/non-acceptable issues."
1,With a title like Dry Ice.....,"It has to be dry. This book was very......very......slow. Reading it was like treading in quicksand. I really enjoyed his previous novel, but this one was terrible."
1,He needs a couch!,"What happened to the doc. All of a sudden he is this whipy, hen ecker hubby. Afraid to say one word out of line with his wife, or anyone else for that matter. I have enjoyed all his previous books, just finished SEige and it was like , Obama telling us we need to me diverse and tolerant. Kill ME was wondeful its downhill from there."
5,Used this a bunch,This book was a good read and even better reference for my practice with Varying Exceptionality Students. Good investment- definitely.
2,"Poorly Written Book for all, Terrible for beginners","This book starts off with classes, with no set introduction for them. Even though I am very proficient in C++ and Java, this book is very confusing and disorganized compared to others. However, it does include a good deal of information about Tkinter widgets. Since this is the only book available, it will have to suffice. Check, out the example from the website, phone.py, which is not even a program, but an email! How rediculous is that? Grayson claims to be some great programmer but can't even edit his own emails and examples!"
3,"Excellent book on Pmw, not Tkinter.","It's a decent book for the experienced python programmer. Definitely not for the beginner. Try working with the ""Python Programming"" by Lutz before you tackle this book. The examples work for a system with python installed. The book does not cover the subject of standalone applications adequately even though there is supposedly a chapter.The book has what would be an excellent reference on Python/Tkinter and Python/Pmw objects and interfaces but numerous typos and deletions make it awkward to use. I have seen books rushed especially one of mine which was in rough form without being spellchecked! I took the flak for what was an editorial snafu. The same may have occurred here with the reference sections."
5,More Than Just Nokia,"I have had this car kit for a while now and the functionality is amazing. The data cable comes in handy for your Nokia phone and charges as well as connects. Using Bluetooth, you can connnect to any Bluetooth compatible phone. The remote is a small wheel with button center and measures about an inch across so you can mount it anywhere, including under the steering column (which I did with velcro, included in the kit.) This way it is out of the way and invisible to those prying eyes looking for anything to set your car apart as a target for thievery. The microphone is the only other visible piece and it hides nicely away near the visor. I don't know about anyone else out there, but I have nearly been in several wrecks both in my car and on my motorcycle that I beleive could have been avoided by using a handsfree device such as this. Handsfree is the law in certain states, mine is not one of them, but if you don't get a handsfree for you do it for someone else!"
5,Love the Gilmore Girls,"The Gilmore Girls mixes both funny and smart. It is a really great combination. I personally enjoy this show a lot, and so does my family. I liked being about to by two seasons at once such as offered here. I think it helps build our collection of the Gilmore Girls. I recommend watching this show and purchasing the DVD's!"
5,Gilmore Girls- The complete first and second season,The Gilmore Girls are GREAT! I missed them on TV when they were first running so I ordered the dvd packages. The Stars Hollow community is highly addictive. It is nice to get lost in a world that that isn't filled with violence and crime and there is still an emphasis on friends and community. Very positive and uplifting. I wish this was still a series. I AM HOOKED!
3,"5 stars for the series, 1 star for the overpriced 'set'",Save $11 and buy the 1st season and the 2nd season seperately here on Amazon.
2,For die hard fans only,"I started reading V.C. Andrews books with the Flowers in the Attic series. I continue to read the new novels that come out, even though they are not as good as the ones Virginia wrote herself. I liked ""Olivia""- it entertained me. Besides Olivia, the characters weren't very developed. Olivia was cold, it was hard to feel anything for her after reading the previous books in the series. If you are a V.C. Andrews fan, I would recommend reading this book because it is the closest you can get to the real thing."
2,How very NOT V. C. Andrews,"Well, I think with this book, I will take V. C. Andrews off my books-to-buy list. I don't even know if I'll bother picking up another one, but if I do, it will be just to skim it (I've barely read any of the last few anyway).This is NOT V. C. Andrews. Olivia Logan did not have such a horrible life; not the best, but not as bad as past Andrew's characters. Anything of interest (such as the the still born baby) only got a few pages of text. Where did the horror go? Remember children locked away in an attic or a family torn apart when a father sold his children? Now those are horrible lives which no one would want to live. That's what V. C. Andrews used to be, right up until this series and the Orphans series. I only hope that the people involved in producing these *V. C. Andrews* books will let her rest in peace."
2,What?,"There are a lot of things that bothered me about this book, the biggest thing being the author not keeping within the correct time period. When was this supposed to have taken place? Surely Olivia wouldn't have been watching television on a regular basis, being two generations ahead of Melody. And on page 322 (paperback), Belinda mentions possibly getting an abortion. What? Abortion wasn't even legal back then! Ever hear of Roe Vs Wade, which took place in the early 1970s? I found it hard to sympathize with Olivia. At times, she was pretty mean. I actually felt sorry for Samuel, at times, I even felt sorry for Belinda. Just what was the author trying to accomplish here? A book about Haille would definitely have been much better."
4,I've seen a copy,This book loses a star due to its rarity and exorburant price whenever you do find it. Otherwise it is a true treasure for the serious student. Anyone in the Tokushima area of Japan can look at a copy in the international center above Tokushima station.
3,Wasn't his best.,Dane Cook's performance on this DVD has him standing on a small stage (unlike the giant arenas where his latest stuff is done) which took away from his act. I like him best on the big stages because his humor is funniest when he has space to be physically animated. Fans of his will know what I mean by this. I also found his material to be mediocre compared to the many other performances of his that I have seen. It did entertain but just not on the level of most of his work.
2,You'll end up returning the product. . . .,"Enjoyed the Wild Wild West on t.v. so when it came out I wanted to purchase this set for my boyfriend; however the DVDs were just stacked on top of each other and they arrived all scratched. Can't be cheap, if a person is gonna spend $80 on it, at least put each individual DVD in its own case. Never even viewed the DVDs, just send them back."
3,WW West,"well. i cannot say a whole lot more than the others have already. but i will say, it got me a bit upset to know that amazon listed this as fedex and it came in the u.s. postal mail unexpectedly. yes, it comes in a semi fancy looking cardboard box designed to look like a lockbox,. get past this and you find two paper saddlebags holding the discs separated by more cardboard. i simply just put each disc into a plastic case. not exactly real intelligent packaging on their part. otherwise, i have watched the bonus disc so far."
1,My Opinion,"I was unable to play the discs in my player, so I can't comment on what this show is like, much to my disappointment!!!!!!!!!!!I would have liked to exchange this for the region coding which would able me to play this in Australia."
3,Early purchasers/adopters get another milking,"Don't get me wrong. This is a 5 star series and the quality of the seasons is excellent, also deserving 5 stars, but once again a major studio releases a box set with extras reported to not be available separately. That's why this gets 3 instead of 5 stars.What you'll get is all four remastered seasons, with the same features, bonuses, etc. as in the individual sets, plus the reunion films, ""Wild Wild West Revisited"" from 1979, and ""More Wild Wild West"" from 1980.The primary downside is there are no plans to release the 2 reunion films separately so you'll have to spring for this set to get them.Another downside is the packaging. Yet another gimick box set designed to scratch disks when inserted into tight cardboard disk holders.Unless you get this for a greatly reduced price and or just *have* to get the rather lackluster later movies, the individual sets are better packaged and an overall better value because of the better packaging."
3,The UnComplete WWW,"I brought Indie the Seasons 1-3.& now I cant find those TV made movies for TWWW anyplaceBUT the box set.I even wrote Amazon.com Customer Support & NO Help.I gave away Season 1 since I didnt care for the BW versions.Love Season 3.2 Bad we cant remake TWWW with sets from Lonesome Dovie, The Sacketts etc.Be real unique."
4,Classic TV in the Modern World,If you are a fan of the modern shows that have all of the characters using special gadgets and tricks to trap criminals and solve mysteries then this is the series for you. This is one of the original TV series that introduced us to undercover work and wry humor. One of the most amazing things that I find in this series is Ross Martin playing so many different characters in disguise and doing such a wonderful job.I have been on an old 60's TV series kick lately and this was truly one of my favorites and worth every penny.
1,No more seasons sets for me,What is the point of buying season sets when the video companies are constantly giving buyers of the complete series more material. From now on I am going to hold off buying individual season sets.
5,ALGO FIRME ! ....SIMPLEMENTE EXCELENTE,"Grupo alemán increible, con temas bien desarrollados..una verdadera expresión del jazz fusion, no creo que exista alguna persona que se atreva a negar que es de lo mejor que se haya descubierto. Gran Guitarra, bajo, bateria tal como un power trio, con la incusión de un teclado que esta donde tiene que estar; si mis palabras no son convincentes... sería el resultado de que esta unidad musical no vale la pena; adelante compañeros no dejen de tener esta pieza, es muy fina, ciao"
4,An American at war,A very personal account by an American aide to General Patton who had an intimate knowledge of all things French.
1,Circular 230,"This article is not at all worth the $5.95 download fee. Quite frankly, I feel ripped off. It is only 1 1/3 pages, and discusses the PROPOSED regulations, not the ones that were actually adopted. The article is a waste of money, and makes me leery of ever again purchasing an article by download (this was my first)."
1,this is why reunions (...),"this album just (...), especially compared to 'can i say?' and 'wig out at denko's,' (...), even '85-86...' these songs are just boring and overpolished. there is no energy. sorry, but i just had to slam it."
5,Very suitable for the novice,"I'm not up to snuff when it comes to chess games--or chess for that matter--but I have found this version of Chessmaster more than suitable for my ability. One has the choice of playing a number of Grandmasters, and there are a slew of tutorials to assist the novice chess player, including one devoted to some 1000+ openings. But in the end, this is only a computer simulation, and to truly enjoy and understand the game, one has to play against other people."
1,Don't Waste Your Money!,"The label says 1 lb, what I received weighed 1/2 lb - not a great start. I love the smell of eucalyptus, enfortunately this product has virtually no smell. I wanted to use it as pot pouri, but it's useless for that. Might be good for something, but I don't know what it would be!"
5,a Pugnacious story..,the absolute best WWII story I've ever read. It is imposible to read this book without picturing Pug as Robert Mitchum. He is the perfect epitome of this character. If you've never seen the TV mini-series or if you've had then read the book. Unforgettable characters in a moment of history that changes the world.
5,"""Enlightening and exciting history lesson""","""The Winds of War"" is not my typical choice of literature; however, I found the novel to be very informative about historical events while still containing the feminine appeal of romance. Wouk masterfully expounded on the events leading to the development of World War II, an era so notorious that so many cannot fathom how it ever reached such extreme measures. By reading the Winds of War one can better understand the perspective of the enemy through the inserted memoirs (""World Empire Lost"") of imaginary general, Armin von Roon. Wouk effectively displays how the subtle breeze of discrimination developed into hurricane force winds of hatred. I found ""The Winds of War"" intriguing and emotional. It is lengthy, but worth the time invested in it."
4,Winds of War,"Long, but worth the time. The author provides an historial account of WWII that headlines or history books of that period could not provide. He personalizes that period by following a family as they deal with the everchanging landscape of war."
3,Someone should smack Pug Henry,"He's a most utterly unappealing protagonist. Wouk wants us to think of Pug as a career-driven, very rigidly moral sort of person. Instead, he came across to me as cold, humorless, stodgy, somewhat hypocritical, and very, VERY boring. The few things Wouk has him do to make him less of a plaster saint (drinks a bit, smokes, lusts in his heart after a young English woman) didn't humanize Pug for me. By the end of the novel, I found him about as likeable as Wouk's other famous character, Captain Queeg.That said, the plot of the novel was engrossing and most of the other characters (Including Hitler and Stalin!)were more interesting and entertaining than Pug.The definite highlight of the book is Wouk writing as the German General van Roon. It's very convincingly done and it is in these sections of the book where what little (sly) humor Wouk offers is to be found."
4,Great book; Kindle version is a disappointment.,"Enough already with the distracting Kindle version typos! Otherwise, a highly readable account of the eve and first years of WWII. The improbabilities are outweighed by the author`s sweeping command of history."
2,"Good entertainment, as long as it's not taken to seriously.","This book, as well as it's sequel, are good for light, entertaining reading. Definately hard to put down.But it's many examples of ridiculousness border on the absurd, with the main one being expected to believe a person of the status and rank of the main character would have the experiences he does."
5,Worst Products Beware!,"BaybyGanics talks a big game but definitely does not deliver. I too can put water in a bottle and call it organic. BabyGanics products are so diluted that they have no cleaning power. I thought it was great to finally find an all natural product that was a little less expensive then most natural cleaning products, but in this case I got what I paid for. I will stick to Method Products from now on!"
1,Um... Did anyone one else read in Time Magazine that her publisher paid her to go on this trip and right the book?,She didn't just go on this spiritual journey because she wanted to better herself...no...she was paid beforehand.
1,Not Worth the Paper It is Printed On,"It's just terrible. It's not a good travel book, romance, or serious religious inquiry. It's what you expect if one of the ""Real Housewives of New Jersey"" got kicked off the show, and took her paychecks off to ""find herself"", only she took most of New Jersey with her.The author should be ashamed. What's worse, she probably isn't."
3,Sigh,In the beginning I was really engrossed by the book and actually read 80 pages while at work. By the time I reached the middle I was over it. I love reading and will stay up all night if the book is really good.....I still havent insihed this a month later so you be the judge.
1,"Indulge, Gaze at Your Navel, Obsess","This book starts off well; it is well written, poignant, humorous, and insightful. Somewhere before the end of Italy though, Elizabeth Gilbert goes from all these lovely and positive traits to a person bent on proving that she deserves to have whatever the heck it is she wants. In fact, we should all do ourselves the favor of becoming self absorbed and selfish.And that is the journey that Gilbert suffers us on. She deserves a break today and everyday and sets out to figure out, ""What does Elizabeth want."" Period.And really how terrific is that, an advance for a book, this book, telling all of us how to achieve selfishness, like we need told, duh.I really enjoyed the first third of the book, but Gilbert gets to be so full of herself, her wisdom, her desires that it is just got b-o-r-i-n-g."
1,Ugh. Save your money.,Don't even bother to read from the library. A self-centered story that is a perfect example of much of what is wrong with our culture.
4,A decent little story,"This is a story of a woman who after going through a messy divorce and an even messier affair decides she needs to find out who she really is. When the story started she never really seemed to know who she is and what makes her happy, so she comes up with an idea to travel for a year and discover herself in the process. She spends her year traveling equally among Italy, India, and Indonesia. In Italy, she spends most of her time eating and making friends. While in India, she spends most of her time in various forms of meditation and prayer. When she finally makes her way to Bali she is looking for balance, but she ends up finding love. While I can see where she has grown and has become more comfortable with who she is in the end, she seemed to spend a lot of time in all three locations engaged in excessive behaviors no real balance. It took me a little while to get into the story, I really wanted to like it and found it to be a decent little story."
1,More like a self-obsessed spiritual journey,"I really wanted to like this book, but she came off as so self-obsessed, selfish, vain, (you get the idea). I understand that the intention was for the author to chronicle her life on her spiritual journey, but she writes in wincing detail her crying jags in the bathroom, how she couldn't understand her husband's anger when she left him for another man and why he couldn't make things easy for her by agreeing to a ""friendly"" divorce....And it goes on from there. Instead of getting insight in another person's quest for spiritual identify, it was all clouded with the ""me, me, me"" theme and distracted this reader from the intention of the book."
3,too much ado about nothing,"I just finished this book and I really had to push myself to finish it.I had heard all the hype about how good it is, how inspirational, blah blah. sorry I was disappointed in all aspects.Primarly she had such wonderful material and backdrop for her story.She was in Rome and I did not feel that she excited the reader to go visit. I know it was not a travel log but the history and culture of the city was missing. she seemed shallow, even high school like in describing her adventures. she appeared naive, selfish and totally unrealistic in most of her travels. the time spent in Bali was depressing. all she ended up doing there was have a relationship with an older man. ho humI concede that she has a marovellous way with words and I really wanted to like this book. it had all the ingredients to be a winner.but for me it was not cooked in the middle"
2,Me Me Me,"I am giving this book 2 stars because the author writes fairly well, and with humor. I won't, however, be recommending it to anyone. This book is a narcissistic trip through life as told by the author, who wants us to empathize with her as she leaves her moneyed lifestyle in the wake of her divorce....and has the luxury of traveling the world as she works through her angst.The navel-gazing became too much for me. I can only wonder what might have happened if Ms. Gilbert had gone to Rome, India, and Bali to serve other people less fortunate than her. That would have made for a much more interesting story, and perhaps she would have grown as a person. As it was, coming along with her while she spent endless amounts of time contemplating herself was a true bore.Don't bother."
1,Couldn't Get Through It,"No matter how hard I tried, I could not get through this book. I finally threw it away after getting halfway. I hate that I wasted the money. I purchased it because there was so much hype surrounding it. I did feel better, however, when I discovered how many people I knew who had also tossed the book after only partially reading it. How so many women can say it is their ""bible"" is completely beyond me."
1,I thought the ME generation was finished,"Well, judging from how well this book is doing, I guess not.Couldn't finish it, self discovery taken to heights that I'm not interested in at all.ME, ME: Me? me... Hello! ME!"
4,A great transformative book,"If you feel like your life is stagnant and that you're just repeating the same cycles of bad decisions over and over, then you need to read this book. I'm not saying you should do as the author and go out to eat, pray and love your way to a breakthrough. But it is great to read about someone who you can relate to and how she finally found herself. The eating part is absolutely salivating and made me wish I too could hop on a plane and eat my way through a country for a few months. The praying part was also inspiring and made me look at meditation in a completely different way. And who doesn't love a good love story?"
2,Trite drivel - a waste of money and time,"I don't normally write reviews but this book drove me to it. I forced my way about half way through the book before realizing it wasn't going to get any better. The character is a weak, self-absorbed person waiting for the whole world to make her life better. She apparently never learned to be responsible for her own happiness and to try and do it without harming others in the process. I deeply regret spending money to buy this tripe."
1,Self-Indulgent,"I don't know what I expected from all the fuss, but it certainly wasn't this. I find this book to be ego-driven and annoying. I'm three quarters through it and don't think I'm going to finish it. It's going straight in the ""donations"" bin."
2,well written but weak story!,"The author certainly writes well, but the story she tells is about her, and her, and her... |Not very interesting!After the first part, my interest was gone to know what was going to happen in the second and third part.Rather disappointing book and probably an even more disappointing film!"
5,"Fun, leisurely reading","I didn't think I would enjoy this author's book as much as I did because in getting to know her within the beginning pages, among other things, here was what I considered a somewhat shallow-souled woman. It turns out, I did enjoy the book because of Ms. Gilbert's writing style. She weaves the serious with the quirky, frank and outspoken, making the book fun to read. The interesting characters she meets on her journeys to Italy, India and Indonesia all come to life as well. Long before the ending of the book, I came to admire Ms. Gilbert for many of the qualities she possessed, mostly her free spirit. A friend sent me this book in hopes of helping me through my own journey (the heavy-duty journey through the Grief of losing my only and beloved son) and I'll admit this book did give me a reprieve for a few long stretches of time."
4,A NEW LIFE,"I ordered this book after watching the Oprah show, which I found revitalizing and was curious about the book. I also sent it to my daughter in England. I am due to retire after 25 years working at a school and looking for ideas to start my new life.I found the book very interesting, but not as revalational as I expected. I was waiting until the end for the true meaning of life, but felt rather let down as it was more like a love story with a lovely happy ending. The book merely said what I already knew that happiness comes from within and you have to work at living.My daughter also enjoyed the book and passed it on to a friend.Well worth a read as a nice book, but not very inspiring.Janet Edwards"
5,"Eat, Pray, Love is a powerful book","Eat, Pray, Love is one of the most brilliant books I have read in a while. It has the power to energize ones spiritual life and put balance into just about any one who reads it. What an incredible blend of truth and honesty, healing and humor she has exhibited. In a time when so many experience what Elizabeth Gilbert experienced, she has set an excellent example of one who refused to let bitterness take root in her life. This book handles spirituality with such tenderness that it positions most faiths into a safe, accepting environment. She depicts her travels in a vivid display of colorful history and interesting, entertaining facts about the people and places she visits."
5,We're all searching!!!,I think it's all been said about this book but I wanted to add how much I enjoyed & loved it and how much I felt like I was losing a friend when I finished the book!
3,"Good start, good middle, disappointing ending","This is definitely a chick lit book. Soul searching around the world. I love the first trip. The second trip makes sense. The third trip left me saying ""Huh?"""
4,Loved EAT Pray Love,"This book was recommended by a friend and it did take some dedication to move through it. Since I have been to Indonesia, and lived in an ashram for a month long yoga teachers training it was easier. Liz Gilvert's humor and intimate details kept me engaged and took me through to the end. I enjoyed the book overall and would recommend it to all women who have either made their spiritual journey or want to."
5,A really great read,"This is one of those books that is worth owning. I first listened to it on an audio book, which was fine, but a little frustrating. There were many nuggets of wisdom that I wanted to dog ear and highlight, share with my spouse and child, read again and again.All that and a great story that I didn't want to end."
1,Pure hogwash / so darn selfish author,"pure drivel... why this even made it on the bestseller list is beyond me...I'd rather read a teenagers diary, they don't sound as selfish and petty as Ms Gilbert usually. Don't waste your money or time."
5,"Eat, Pray, Love","A fabulous book, and wonderfully written with great humor and wisdom. I would read it with a highlighter since there were so many spiritual lessons I would have liked to read twice. A great Holiday gift at a great price- much less than the stores, Thanks Amazon.com!"
1,Almost a waste of paper,"Initially I wasn't even going to give this ""novel"" one star, but, since it turned out to be the perfect width to stabilize my wobbly photo basket, I decided it wasn't totally worthless. I can't believe this made the NY Times Best Seller list. I'm astonished that someone thought it would make a good movie."
3,Somewhat bored...,"I usually enjoy memoirs or travel but struggled through this one. I think its because she has so much privilege yet often fails to see it. Not everyone has the luxury of spending three months each in Italy, India and Indonesia just to ""find"" themselves.Its not my cup of tea but is an interesting look at how one woman lost nearly everything she believed essential and renewed her self-esteem and confidence.If you're interested in the travel aspect I would stear away since it doesn't cover much about the three countries."
1,The most overhyped book of 2008,"I truly can't understand what the excitement was all about with this book. This book is full of self absorbed drivel where the author carried on, and on, and on... about the demise of her marriage throughout the entire novel. I couldn't sympathise with her as the break up didn't appear to be that bad.I felt embarassed for her in the way she carried on about herself as though it was the worst thing in the world when outside the ashram in India was total poverty. Honestly don't waste your time or money on this drivel."
1,Dreadfully boring,This was an immensely boring book! I would not recommend it. I tried so hard to finish it but just could not.
1,Just couldn't get into this book,"I am an avid reader. I watched some of this movie & know alot of ppl love this book so I decided to give it a try. I just couldn't get into it. I felt like there was just too much whining. I gave it 9 chapters before I decided to give up on it. Eat, Prey Love is just not my kind of book."
3,I self-indulged,"I've read some of the negative reviews for Eat, Pray, Love and while I do agree that it was VERY self-indulgent.. I think it was to be expected. Come on, do people REALLY take 1 year vacations to wander around the world post-divorce? This book is essentially Under the Tuscan Sun but dumbed down. It can't be expected to touch upon the poverty and class isuess or tackle the guru's sexual inappropriateness. And, if you take it as it is - of one woman's solo adventure to 'find herself' as naive as it may be, then this book is a great read. It's an easy read and captures you into the story."
5,Great - Give it a Read,"I am surprised by the fervor of some of the negative reviews for this book. It is entertaining, funny in part, and remindful of the importance of listening to and understanding ourselves and the importance of exploring one's spirituality, however one defines spirituality.Lucky for us, Ms. Gilbert shares her insight openly and honestly. Geez Louise folks, she is not whiny and, honestly, not every woman wants kids, so what's up with the judgments? If you're not self-absorbed while on a spiritual journey, then what's the point of being on that journey? Way too much author negativity in some of these reviews...This is a good book, and I have re-read many of the tales. Did it change my life? Maybe not, but it has given me some new ideas to ponder, and that's about all I need from a book."
2,Good in the beginning...then is went downhill.,"This book was very fun to read when the author was in Italy. Her character really began to develop and the way she wrote made you care about her failing marriage and her depression. However, when she gets to India, the book loses momentum (halfway in book). I just think there is so much more she could have done with showing the difference in lifestyle and culture from being in Italy to going to an ashram. Once she gets to Indonesia, it isn't very clear exactly what her purpose is (although it is supposed to be to let go and have the wild love affair with the Brazilian guy). I didn't feel connected to her character anymore and frankly, I couldn't wait for the book to end and found myself wanting to stop reading it toward the last few pages. I left it on the plane for someone else.Integrative Nutrition"
5,"Eat,Pray,Love","Incredible book! I loved it. Excellent writer. Her sense of humor and wit is wonderful to read. I will be re-reading this book and plan on purchasing a few copies for holiday gifts. My book group read this for October, and everyone (very rare) Loved it. What a gifted writer. I look forward to reading her other books, starting with *Stern Men*."
1,Suffering - Seriously suffering,"I am trying so hard to get to the last page of this book. I have less than half way to go, and I can't stop there when I've gotten this far. I really wish I could, I AM SUFFERING. I usually am very lenient with rating books, however this one is THAT horrible. There is no story, no purpose really -- at least not yet -- and I force myself to read it. That's not what I call a good book. A good book should have me stay up all night just to know what happens next, not stay up all night just to get rid of it forever and try and finish up all the pages."
1,waste of precious time,"It shocks me that some people actually liked this book. I read about 50 pages and then completely lost interest in her self-indulgent prattle.Please read ""3 Cups of Tea"" for some real life-changing inspiration."
1,I Cannot believe someone paid her to write this!!!,"First off this book is a waste of money!I cannot believe someone paid Elizabeth Gilbert to write this book.It's sick and horrible. She cries at night and wishes she died. She does not want kids. It's obvious she has some kind of mental issue with herself. She never appreciated what she had. She likes men who do not care about her. I mean if you want to read about a thirty something year old getting divorce, who is horney and globe trots around the world good for you. She is just very sick and depressing."
2,"eat, pray, love","I was watching Oprah one day and the author of this book was on. After listening to the said interview, I ordered this book. It was interesting."
2,Couldn't finish it...disappointing,"I only give this book two stars because I did enjoy the first ""book"" and that's why I give this two stars instead of one. However, the whining of the author gets annoying and it's also the same stuff repeated over and over throughout the book. Elizabeth Gilbert comes across as very shallow and self-absored throughout the book. I just had a very difficult time seeing her point of view as far as how horrible her life was because she didn't know what she wanted from it. This book did not live up to the reviews written and the hype around it."
5,"Eat, Pray Love",A must-read for all those struggling with who they are and how God fits into our daily lives. Very inspriational book.
1,Disappointing . . .,"I found this book to be neither insightful or humorous. Okay writing, very self-absorbed, somewhat tedious, rather pointless. I am very surprised by the number of good reviews. It really seemed that she just wanted to feel loved again and that the sex and companionship at the end was all she really needed/wanted."
1,I just can't get through this book,"This was picked as a book club book, the library owns no copies, so I had to buy it. I am half way through (book club meeting was last week) and I doubt I'll even bother to pick it back up. This woman is too whiny and I just want to smack her one good time! She keeps going off on tangents and can't keep on track. Waste of money in my opinion. Would never buy another one of her books!"
2,Completely annoying,"After hearing all the hype, I bought the book and was psyched to read it. I was a little wary through the eat section, but thought it was pretty entertaining. But by the time she got to India, I was completely over it. Pretentious, repetitive claptrap. If you are the type of person who likes ""The Secret"" this is in your wheelhouse, but people who aren't searching for a spiritual awakening (or who don't want to hear about the voices that guide us)should steer clear."
2,Disappointment,"I could hardly drag myself through this book. The first chapter was captivating. I throughly enjoyed the narrative voice and the content of the Italian section. The two following sections weren't nearly as engaging as the first one. I could have rated this book much higher had it only been the first section and nothing more.The two later sections, India and Indonesia, were not much more than a lot of complaining. There wasn't much insightfulness in those sections, it was like two totally different books than the first Italian section.I would pass on this one."
2,Not worth the hype - rubbed me the wrong way,"May be it's because i was born in a less affluent nation than Elizabeth Gilbert - but this was just another example of the culture of American affluence and focus on shamelessly putting sexual and sensual gratification above everything else in life - another sex in the city.I just just don't get that happily married woman will leave her affluent life and her husband to get laid in other countries by foreign men in place of finding something more constructive and meaningful. but then, it's her life and she is feel free to do what she wants to do with it - it just did not make an interesting read. I could only force myself to read a few pages, then had to skip through. I tried sampling other pages but same garbage and self gratification followed.thankfully, I was able to sell it at the college and get rid of it."
2,Too many political opinions,This is an entertaining book if you enjoy reading about someone who is self-absorbed and doesn't realize how great our country is. I was enjoying the book until the author kept dogging the government and Bush/Republicans. I don't appreciate paying for a book and the author write about her political opinions. I hope the movie is better.
2,just so so,"I decided to see what all the hype was about and honestly, pretty disappointed and found myself skimming the whole India section. Maybe it's b/c I'm not a Yogi-type, but it just went on and on with not a lot of action. Just not my type of book I guess."
4,Okay,Book is fine. The only thing I wish the description had told me was there was writing on the cover and the inside covers of the book. I just would have liked to know that.
1,"Blah, blah, blah, blah....","I could not finish this book. When the author burst into sobs yet again in the middle of prayer, or a conversation, or walking down the street, or (more likely) on the floor of yet another bathroom, I gave up. This is the type of person you meet at a cocktail party and RUN in the other direction after a few minutes when she starts spewing out all her problems at you with no end in sight. Note to the author: I am your reader, not your psychotherapist. I really tried to enjoy the book and even like the author, but after slogging through a couple hundred pages of endlessly self-absorbed chatter, I was worn out and put the book in the Goodwill pile. When she writes, ""I discovered my mind was not a very interesting place to be,"" I have to say, ""Amen, sister!"""
1,"Not for me, please!","This book was a Mother's Day gift having been highly recommended to my husband from a bookseller. I kept wishing it would get better.... I would appreciate the author's style and her story as the pages went on and on and on ad nauseum. After getting through about 2/3 of it I quit. The author's personality was not one which I could either admire, her actions not those I would like to emulate. This was one of the ""best sellers"" that had me completely mystified. Hard to believe it's been on any charts - it certainly is NOT any book I would recommend anyone waste their time reading."
1,"Wrong Expectation, Awful taste","I started off with the wrong expectation. I expected more of a travelogue, like Alice Steinbach (LOVE Without Reservations!). Instead I was overwhelmed by the constant whiny tone of the book. I tried so hard to give her the benefit of doubt but the author was so self- absorbed and it showed the entire book long. That she can write is no doubt. Her narration can is witty, and her thoughts very well constructed and clearly conveyed. But what she had to say, I didn't enjoy. There was no depth, no conclusion. What's the point of her book? It felt more like reading a diary written with the maturity of a teenage girl. I am baffled it was so highly reviewed."
1,"Whine, Pose, Indulge",It only made me ponder one Great Question: How did she get a publisher to pay her to go on a world tour of self indulgence? The book is garbage. But her agent is a great artist indeed.
1,Don't Waste Your Time,"It is this month's selection for my book club and I am forcing myself to get through it, but feeling extremely resentful about the waste of my time. She is a competent writer, but maybe better off writing on topics other than herself. If you are going to spend time reading a memoir, a basic rule of thumb is that the memoirist needs to be someone you think you might enjoy spending time with. Liz Gilbert does not strike me as that sort of person. She is not interesting enough to be so self-absorbed. So, apart from her tip that there is a restaurant in Naples that serves the best pizza on the planet, I find little to commend about this book."
1,Leave it on the bathroom floor,"Man, my hat is off to those reviewers who finished the book because I just didn't have it in me to stick with it. The heroine was so uninteresting and so self-important. She lost me at ""bathroom floor"". If you must read it, get it from the library."
1,Self absorbion,"If this book were written by a man about a man it would never be published.This is the story of a book deal.The book and the cost of the trip were all arranged in advance.One unhappy women and how she spreads her unhappiness to every man she meets by teasing and taunting them with her sexuality, what an old duche bag"
1,Disappointing,"I am baffled as to how so many people can rave about this book. In my assessment, it was simply an account of a highly neurotic woman dealing with a divorce. And she finally pulls herself together at the end, when she finds another relationship. The only pleasure I got out of the book was following a fantasy of traveling for a year, with no apparent financial concerns."
2,Most bi-polar book ever!,"I had high hopes for this book and the first section in India was rather charming. She eats great food, talks with interesting people and lives a life of ease that most of us can envy at least for a while.Unfortunately, when she goes to India, the book becomes this self-indulgent drivel. I just found myself not caring about how still she could become or how long she sat in a meditation cave.The last section in Bali is OK. The parts about the Balinese society are quite well done but there's an awful lot that was just dull.It's obvious that Ms. Gilbert can write, but she needs to do it without so much whining."
1,One of the most destructive books ever written,"50 somethings reading this believing they are 30 thinking this is their life story.Abandoning long term solid relationships because ""enlightenment"" is out there.Eat, pray, love and then what naturally follows eating!"
2,Thankfully that's over,"It has never taken me 2 months to read a book before. I never thought I would ever get through this book, but I was determined to finish. I liked Italy and parts of Indonesia. I think anyone can write a book on their life. Everyone has fallen on hard times. We just do not write books about it. Maybe we should. I didn't feel sorry for her at all. I found her annoying and self-absorbed. She ran away for a year, because she couldn't bare to face her life that she made a mess of. I am glad I finished it, but I am not glad I read it."
2,There is so much better out there,I can not understand the rave reviews this book get - maybe because it's an Oprah selection and her followers would buy whatever she recommends....what a pity. This book has taught me nothing. The writer is self indulgent and I could not connect with her at all. I read another non-fiction travel story recently titled Crying with Cockroaches and what a joy! Get it and spot the difference.
1,Worst Book I've Ever Read,"I also wish zero stars was an option! Gilbert's shallow writing style combined with her self-indulgent point of view make this book nauseating. I received it as a gift but otherwise never would have read it. I kept waiting for the ""good part"" which NEVER came.Worse yet, Gilbert's narrow perspective exoticizes and orientalizes everything ""different"" or ""new"" that she sees. She belittles the people that she meets as they try to fit into her Gilbert-centric universe. Her book is the worst possible example of American travel writing. Spare yourself the pain and skip this book!"
5,Amazing spiritual journey...,"Elizabeth Gilbert gives a no-holds-barred account of her life as she goes through her divorce, ends an unhappy affair, and seeks varied spiritual enlightenments in Italy, India, and Indonesia. Ms. Gilbert, despite the angst through which she goes, tells her story with humor, pathos, and truth."
2,Ultimately disappointing,"This book starts out wonderfully. The writer is smart, funny, and the woman can write! She says, early on in her travels, that she can make friends with anyone, and you believe her because she is so engaging and vibrant, and her stories are compelling and fun to read. You are willing to listen to her say just about anything because she says it in such an entertaining way. But somewhere, in the middle of the book I started to get tired of the stories. Everything works out, nothing goes wrong, and there appears to be very little true soul searching below the surface. The book is being hailed as a spiritual journal, but it really never gets below the veneer of anecdotes. The author is good company, but her journey is ultimately disappointing."
5,excellet book,this is an absolutely great good and I read from beginning to end in a heartbeat!!!!very insightful and humorous at the same time!
5,A Great Personal Account of Finding the Divine.,This book is written by a real person writing honestly and humorously about her path to find and commune with the divine. She is an inspiration to all who are following a spiritual path.
1,Hmm...,"I purchased this book (after hearing from a few members of my book club that it was inspiring and wonderful) with an open mind and expecting something that I could apply to my own life. I regret to say that it was boring, uneventful and a complete waste of money. Every book is not for everyone and this one was not for me. I have been reading since I was four and I LOVE to read; this book is the first book that I have not been able to finish. I could not relate to anything that she did/went through to find herself. Just my opinion but this book was not for me."
1,really boring,"I could not finish this trivia and was very disappointed. She could not make me care about the tiniest thought she had, especially in her ashram era. No literary or redeeming value whatsoever. Give me a story with characters about whom I care."
5,LOVED IT!!!,"Elizabeth Gilbert lets you taste a pice of freedom...I love how she describes Italy...I get that, I feel the same way when I am there..It was beautiful written and a joy to read!"
4,If only...,"I recieved this book as a christmas present and didn't read it for about 7 months. I had gone through a sad break up and had moved half way across the country to start anew. I got a new job and decided to finally read this book. I am so glad I did. I recognized myself in so many of the author's feelings about her divorce and and the mental anguish a break up puts you through. I loved the Italy part and had a fondness for India, but I felt pretty detached when it came to Bali. Overall I found this book to be an easy enjoyable read and I will be recomending it to all of my friends."
4,Don't Expect a Book to Change Your Life,"I really enjoyed this book for what it is: a book. So many reviews are angry with the book, the author, the publisher, etc. Why? The book is the memoir of one woman's year-long trip. Yes, it is unrealistic for most people; we simply can't up and go off for a year, leave jobs, and not to mention - where'd we get the money? But she could, and so, let her!No one is trying to brain-wash the general public into taking her book as gospel. So, you disagreed with her insights... and... ???I don't think I'll ever afford a trip around the world, and I certainly never wish to rough it in an ashram. I did, however, enjoy hearing about her journey."
5,"Eat, Pray, Love","This is one of my all-time favorite books - and I'm such an avid reader than I have two Kindles! This is a great read for woman of all ages, though teens and younger may not fully appreciate it. It made me feel normal. I read it twice, then passed it on to my mom, who loved it just as much. She gave it to her friend to read afterward. Who knows who has it by now, but I thinks that speaks to what a great book it is that we women keep giving it to others to share!"
1,complete overblown junk,this book is absolute crap and its only merit is that it is testimony to the power of marketing. I actually threw it against the wall I disliked it so much.
4,Adventurous Life,"If you have an adventurous and inquiring spirit, but are tied down at this time, here is your chance to explore vicariously. You don't have to agree with everything she does or thinks, but it is exciting to be along for the ride. All of us 40's/50's(baby boomers), empty nesters, life transition folks who want to review their lives and find a path to the next chapter should read this book."
3,"Book- Eat, Pray, Love",This was a travel-log and I enjoyed parts of the book. It got slow in the middle.
3,Wish I could take paid time off to write a book,"This book was a well written account of the author's personal search for herself, but it came across as much too much self absorption. No wonder she needed to flee after her failed marriage and affair. She needed to get away from herself! It was good to see that she finally discovered the answers were in focusing on others instead of her own self."
3,"eat, pray, love","this book was not what i had expected. ""everyone"" was saying 'oh, you've got to read this'. i found it less exciting and less insightful. i wish we all could be privileged enough to travel to 'find ourselves'. that not being the case, i was unable to really get a realistic feel from this writer."
1,"Can you say, ""self absorbed?""","This is a book by a self-absorbed, wealthy, spoiled Manhattanite. Her life seems to consist of basically whining, self-analyzing, and the pursuit of her personal happiness. Her world is All About Wonderful, Deserving Me.If that sounds interesting to you, read away.All I can say is YAWN. (With a fair amount of GAG mixed in.)"
2,Far from enlightenment,"The first third of this book was painful, but I stuck it out due to my friend's strong recommendation. The incessant whining and droning on about her life was compounded by paragraph-long analogies that were recycled from a few Sex in the City episodes. (And yes, I find it ironic that I am complaining about Gilbert's complaining) The writing was self-absorbed and downright egotistical at times, which is quite a juxtaposition to her spiritual quest of egolessness. But in order to see the light, you have to go through the darkness. And maybe this was Gilbert's intention when writing this book. But regardless, I found it neither well written nor enlightening."
1,What the?,"So THIS is what all the noise is about? I guess I too could write a ""memoir"" about my trip to Italy and all my great meals and drone on and on about my ex boyfriend. The India section? Total impenetrable stereotype. Indonesia? Hunh? Another work from a moneyed, privileged NYC writer that makes women appear superficial. I'm embarassed to have bought this."
1,Eat Pray Love,I could not get into this book. I am going to watch the movie and hopefully I like it.
5,What book did the other reviewers read?,"I put off reading this book because of some of the negative reviews on this Website. It wasn't until my daughter insisted that I read it, that I did. I loved it! I couldn't put it down. Her spiritual journey was real, and I could really relate to her. I so wish I could spend the same year that she took, but I'm just not that brave. I loved this book!"
5,Inspirational,This is a wonderful inspirational book - I felt like I was going through the travels and the journey with her. I related to a lot of the things that she had and was experiencing in her life. Can't wait to see the movie when it comes out.
4,very good read,this book was awesome. i really enjoyed it and that means something from someone who is not the hugest fan of this type of book. the only reason i did not give the book 5 stars is because for me i have read a book or 2 i enjoyed more. i wour put this in the top ten though
5,This ubud's for you bud!,"What a piece of work. Not just the beautiful writing (must be read in English - sorry all translators, can't imagine how you can ever do justice) but the actual transformation behind the words. It would never be described as a self-help book but it might be the most actual self help book ever written (or lived). It's definitely a chick book - but one that every man should read... especially if you are raising two daughters, like I do, who you want to understand better now and later... Or if you are Married, ever been married or ever want to get married. If you like Italy, traveling, relationships, anthropology and social reflections of American and world cultures, eating, health, yoga, meditation, love and pursuit of happiness all bound together with spiritual observations this ubud's for you bud! Thank you Liz Gilbert and good on'ya. ps. I ""read"" the Audio book, read or rather ""performed"" by the author. wow."
2,Please...Stop the Pity Party,"Elizabeth Gilbert's quest to deal with life post-divorce could have been interesting, enlightening and entertaining. Instead, the reader is treated to whining, moaning and more whining. I rapidly lost sympathy for her and could only wonder how her marriage lasted as long as it did. Ms. Gilbert is a gifted writer and parts of the book were witty and humorous, but too often she succumbed to the temptation to wallow in self-pity. Too bad...this could have been a great book."
5,A Must Read,I love Elizabeth! She writes this book like she's your very best friend and is sending you personal emails daily. What a brave and talented lady; not only to take a journey into the unknown but then to have the talent to express it in this book.
1,Waste of time,"This was a self absorbed self centered woman. Her subtitle was to find everything. She ended up with nothing. When she said her eyes during the divorce were like a refugee, I thought you should have spent the money going to Africa and seen REAL refugee eyes. And in Indonesia when she got a bladder infection, and called it a TRAGEDY, it was too much.Better still she should have gone to Africa to help people and she would have ended up with what she searched for which was ""everything"".I certainly will never buy a book by Elizabeth Gilbert!"
1,Boring and self-centered,"Isn't it ironic that the three countries that the author traveled begin with the letter ""I"" as did nearly every sentence in the book? What a sex-crazed narcisist!"
4,Wittingly Surprising,"After hearing so much about the book on various TV shows, and women commenting on it, Yes, I decided to purchase the book.The book is written with alot of entertainment, a play on words, she is very good in terms of being witty and capturing your attention. Although, she expands her stories to three locations. She looses me after Italy. The writing is still good, her description of emotions and experiences are still great. But I was a touch disappointed!Nonetheless, the book is about a journey in finding oneself, and I must admit was therapeutic for me, the book did manage to change my views on things. However I too, come from a long journey of events, and yes. I choose to find a sense of humour in life. So I do eat, pray, and love.I would recommend a definite read."
2,Looking for a good travel memoir.....this book wouldn't be your best choice!,"I found this book to be very disappointing. It dwells far too much on the author's divorce and her issues with depression and loneliness. If you're looking for a self help book on how to recover from a painful divorce and/or get past issues of depression, perhaps you'd enjoy this book. However, if you're looking for an enjoyable tale about world travel, this isn't it. The brief details included about the three countries Ms. Gilbert visited are not enough to make up for the overall dreary tone of the rest of the book."
1,Promiscuous author,"I think this book should be called ""sleeping my way across the world"". She cheapens the concept of love and what we need to bring peace/respect to our civilization. This is an ""Oprah mentality/religious treastise"". Pitiful!!!!!"
2,much adoo about so little,"a very advertised and highly recommented by different people....to my opinion though,it is certainly a lot less than expected, and very ''posed'', too.The writer tries to make her point.the fact is that, neither her language, hor her writing talents, prove enough for the issues talked about in the book."
3,Fun Read,"Yes, if I had a $200,000 advance, I probably would have done something different than spending it on myself. And yes, other people have gone through worse than a nasty divorce. But that's what this author was facing, and that's what she chose to do to heal. If you can get past that, it's actually a fun read."
2,Good weekend read,"After being recommended this book by two different friends, I thought I would give the book a try. I saw the movie, and thought the movie didn't do the book justice! The movie was not deep and the characters were not connected. The book was indeed slightly better. I hardly read any fiction or travel memoir, but I decided to indulge on a lazy cold Sunday afternoon and curled up on my sofa with this book. I feel that I can relate to Gilbert on many levels: her worries, her guilt, her self-doubt as a member of the society, and her determination to pursue love and happiness. I also laugh at her self-deprecating jokes. The part about Italy was absolutely funny, but I start to lose focus in the later parts. I can see some reviewers would be annoyed by the long-windedness...afterall, not bad for a quick entertaining read!"
4,"LOVED EAT, PRAY, LOVE","I felt like I traveled along this wonderful journey with Gilbert as I read this book. Not since, Michelle Kane's CONFESSIONS OF A CATHOLIC SCHOOLGIRL have I felt such a spiritual awakening in my own life.Confessions of a Catholic Schoolgirl"
2,boring and self involved,"I have read about six chapters and have decided not to force myself to read the rest. The author is not the kind of person I can relate to or respect. She is obviously spoiled and selfish. She goes on about how unsatisfied and unhappy she is with her life. Next, she had no problem leaving her husband to jump into a live-in relationship with her lover while still married. And, of course... we had to hear how broken up and lost she was when that fell apart. I could not believe it when that happened....not. The next surprise was that after her selfish husband took all her assets, she gets to travel to India, Indonesia and Italy...all to discover WHO SHE IS, while writing a book for her job. What a lot of crap. The sad part is that now she's making a boat load of money on the book and movie. Luckily, I did not pay for the book because a friend loaned it to me. Please don't waste your time or money."
1,Not good,"I love to read almost anything, but this book just is not good. I had no idea I would be reading about someone's depression. I too, went through a divorce. But this is just ridiculous. Get over it already. I guess I'm only reviewing the 'eat' section, since I could not get through it to make it to the other sections. I love Julia Roberts so I thought the book might be good. After trying to read it, I don't even want to see the movie."
1,Where's the editor?,"I tried to like this book. I wanted to like this book. But I don't. The writing is incredibly unfocused. The author is amazingly self-centered. Yes, it's a memoir, but even for that genre it's worse than most. And it's boring. A trip of a lifetime to Italy (which is as far as I got) could (should) have been captivating. It wasn't. So I'm giving it back - unread - to the person who loaned it to me."
4,"""Look for God the way a man with his head on fire looks for water.""","Very insightful bits in it, but mostly a ""chick flick"" if it was turned into a movie. However, being a chick, I thoroughly enjoyed it. I think a lot of people are like, ""she's surrounded by poverty and all kinds of depravation and all she can think about is herself."" Well, so what? It's like another reviewere said, just because there are starving kids in Somalia doesn't mean I can't worry over my sick child. sometimes you have to take care of yourself first, and that in itself can be a hard thing to do at times. The story was capturing and despite everything else, still had a lot of good insight and inspiration. I would only wish we all had that kind of money to go soul-searching whenever we needed to."
3,long weekend with a girlfriend,"THis book is like going on a three-day weekend with a very chatty girlfriend. The first two days are fun and interesting; sometimes funny, sometimes insightful. But, by the third day, you've really heard enough of her talking and start to wonder how much of what she says is really true."
5,More than a good read,It has been a long time since a book has moved me so. It took me places I know I will never go but feel I have made the journey in my soul. Thank you Liz Gilbert!
2,so what already?,"""beautifully written"" is not a phrase I would use to describe this book. although this book is about the author's ""journey"", the constant introspection gets tedious and the word ""I"" becomes a cancerous tumor that begs to be removed from the pages."
1,"pure awfulness, worse than a bad rash","I hated this book after the author while sobbing in her bathroom yet again, announces that she knows she should think about having a child but when she gets her period is relieved that she gets to live, yes these are her words, live yet another month. Please for the sake of soicety don't EVER have children! This book made me mad to read, the author is a disgrace to women with her endless self absorbtion, whiny narrative and ugly disregard for the cultures she polluted by visiting looking for guess what? Herself. This book isn't worth the paper it was printed on and like others, I only read it because it is was a book club selection. Godawful."
3,Eat Pray Love,At some times I thought it was slow but overall I enjoyed it very much.Spirtuality it is a great read.
3,Not good,"I like books that are collections of true life experiences, I was bored with this I just couldnt get into the stories. I really enjoyed Mr Instability by Tom Elsa its was a laugh out loud book with excellent true stories. Oh well off too read the next one!"
3,gilbert,"A memoir about Gilbert's journey through Italy, India, and Indonesia following her painful divorce. The book is divided into 3 equal sections. The first, and my favorite, details her gustatory journey through Italy. She then goes on to discover spirituality in India and, finally, love in Indonesia. I did not find the book particularly inspiring or uplifting though I wouldn't go so far as to say I disliked it. Again, I found the journey through Italy to be humorous and lighthearted. As for the rest? It didn't quite deliver."
1,Weak,"I really got annoyed with this book. I had high expectations and quickly was let down. The main character is irritating, totally self absorbed and pretty much an empty vessel. The plot is obvious and weak. its about one spoilt American womans shortcut to buying a sense of spiritual self. She doesnt work, just floats about trying to be 'holy' and emails her vast collection of wealthy friends back in the states to buy a poor woman a house. It has all the spirituality of a Mc Donalds cheeseburger."
1,BAD,"Not good. Not interesting. If I had the money to travel around the world, I'm sure I could have a spiritual awakening too."
1,Less Than One Star...,"Possibly the most selfish, conceited, boring woman alive. Is it remotely possible that with the exception of her poor exhusband she only knows the most beautiful, the most intelligent humans to inhabit earth? And that she counts herself amoung them?! A total waste of the trees used to print this dribble of total self-absorption -- being paid to write about a years vacation is obscene! Her eternity will be the smoking one. And I hope she never becomes a mother -- the poor child will be ignored for her mother's higher puroses or because the poor thing could never be as beautiful or smart as her mother..."
4,Pick this up every couple of days and you won't be disappointed,"There are so many wonderful reviews on the contents of this book already. I can understand the spectrum of opinions as I share some of them. What I find is this book is, if you will forgive me, like box of chocolates: you wouldn't want to eat them all in one sitting or you would tire of the taste of chocolate. I found that, as I read this book over a period of two months, it felt more genuine as real time had passed - and Gilbert's journey had also passed. She is a talented writer, no doubt about it. But the subject matter demands objectivity gleaned through time. Keep it on your nightstand and pick it up the way you might a book about practical encouragement or support. Then, you will not be disappointed, but rather feel you are catching up with an old friend."
2,Would have been really good without all the cliches,"I saw the film before reading the book so I had very low expectations as I thought the film was mindless rubbish and still I was disappointed. I cannot believe this was on the New York Times bestseller list for 199 weeks! The book has more substance than the film (which isn't saying much) but unfortunately the author seems to get bogged down in cliches. Having travelled to all three countries, the author presents them in the most stereotypical, cookie-cutter way which is a shame because I suspect there is real depth in there somewhere but it doesn't come through in this book. Some of the parts about meditation in India are interesting but the characters are cardboard cut-outs and the author seems constantly self-conscious about the image she is projecting. Cultural stereotypes never make good reading. I wanted to find a moment of depth or revelation but it's about as deep as a mills and boon."
1,how many eyes looket at it?,"Ditto to all the one-star reviewers. And the movie itself isn't even worthy enough to be labeled maudlin. But what does the public want? Bread and circuses. It sells books. That is the real American story here. Get rich quick. Now, I'm going to see if Ms. Gilbert will take me as a client for some prosperity coaching."
2,get it from the library,"A friend recommended this book to me. I looked forward to reading it but it took me WEEKS to read this book. And I MADE myself finish it. When a writer engages me I can read quickly. I wasn't crazy about her style or narrative. She seemed a bit self aborbed and superficial. Yes, I get that its her own observations and experiences but most of the time, I felt like 'get over yourself already'. People deal with broken hearts every day and don't have this much drama. Its as much the time that heals as anything that you 'do'. It was a pass to me - I wouldn't recommend it."
5,Richly enjoyable & enlightening!,"I absolutely loved this book. Her personal story of her travels & adventures both geographically & spiritually were so enlightening to me, and a complete delight to read!"
3,It's one person's biography,"Elizabeth Gilbert is a good writer. Do I find her particularly insightful, or her story interesting? Not really. Then again, this is one woman's story. To critique someone's personal story amounts to expressing whether or not we ""like"" the person or what she has to say. The writing is good enough and her story inoffensive. For a treatment on spirituality, this isn't the book to read and it doesn't pretend to be. For a leisurely read about someone with whom the reader might have some experience in common, I can see it being enjoyable."
4,"Not finished reading all of it yet, so far so good","Not finished reading all of it yet, so far so good. I'm glad I got it. 4 more words required"
4,Good condition!,I got the book fairly quickly (under two weeks) and it came in great condition. I felt like I was reading a brand new book.
5,Good introspection; good read.,"I felt like I was sitting down with Liss. She was open, honest, and very spiritual. I learned from it, and will reread it."
5,What a Joy to Read,This is the 2nd copy I've bought of this book. I ordered several for my family and gave away my copy. I wanted one for myself for my library and am reading it again for the 3rd time. This book expands one's mind as it follows one woman's journey in this path called life. One of the most enjoyable books I've read.
2,Not a lot of depth,"The stories of the travels and the description of those met along the way are entertaining, but I had a difficult time relating to the author. I think this is best shown when the Ashram staff chooses her for a hostess duty referred to as ""Little Suzy Creamcheese"". On a spiritual journey it is best to leave the sorority rush personality behind."
1,Got life experience?,"There are so many reviews and so much buzz here and elsewhere about this book. If you are considering whether to read this book or not, all I can say is that if you have lived a considered life, have travelled, maybe lived in another country or culture for awhile, read widely, and questioned yourself and/or your motives occasionally, you will probably not enjoy this book.In my view, Eat, Pray, Love appeals to the kind of woman who wishes she had time, freedom, and/or income to do the things Elizabeth Gilbert writes about. Reading the book is a way for ordinary women to live vicariously through someone else's travels and search for self. If you have already done any of this kind of inner work for yourself, in your own country or elsewhere, you will likely come away disappointed with the lack of depth in the book.If, however, you are looking for inspiration or courage to begin your own spiritual or physical travels, you might find this book worthwhile."
2,Not that enthused,I purchased this because it was the required text book for a class. I am not at all impressed with it and told the teacher to find a different one for next year. I find her style hard to follow and learn from.
4,Works for studies,"Not too much elaboration on important methods. I bought this for my masters degree and I guess it fits for the topic. I expected it to be in better used condition than mentioned in the description but then again, it still had the discs...so that was the plus point."
4,Good sounding headphone but has some issues with wear and tear,"Had this head phone for I say about 4-5 years now and still use it daily. The first thing to go on this headphone is the foam padding on the headband and the earpads it will start to dry out, crack and peal after a couple of years, the good news it you can buy replacement ear pads online to replace them. Also something you might have to replace is the wires, mine died recently...well the left side did, but just like the ear pads this is something you can replace on the headphone."
4,Very useful little book,"As a makeup veteran (been wearing it over 35 years), I still found this book surprisingly useful. Schick is a very no-nonsense commentator who merrily admits to her beauty problem, and prefers the natural look that I favour (and I also share her colouring, which is useful). Her tips on invisible eyeliner, following the lip's natural line rather than the colour line, and washing your hair with conditioner instead of shampoo all work a treat, and she gives very good information on makeup brushes and what to look for in a concealer. If the book has a fault, it's that she doesn't mention any particular make-up brands, which is probably to avoid irritating her clients, but as someone who lives in the countryside and has to buy makeup mail order without being able to test it, I would have loved her recommendations. I am not sure, for instance, how to tell if an eyebrow pencil has 35 per cent pigment. Despite that, though, a very welcome addition to my beauty library."
1,A real disappointment,"I just don't understand the positive reviews this book has received. I own many books on beauty and fashion, and this one is a real disappointment. I learned nothing I don't already know and if I had the energy, I'd return it. It's sophomoric in style and seems outdated as well."
1,I Need the XP Driver Patch,"I need the XP patch in order to make my new Evolution MP3 player work on my computer. If you have one, please submit a comment here and I'll post my email address or try to get Amazon to put us in contact with one another. (I am reluctant to post my email address on this site.)"
3,where is the xp update?,"great product, i bought it like a year ago, i live in costa rica, and a cousin send it to me from miami, everythimg was great... then the fm tuner started to get worst, until nothing...all i get is static now. but well ok, i really didn't get it for the tuner, i still got the mp3, i put in some songs, and later that night i change my windows, from 2000 to xp,i have the same songs since then, i called the office... ""yes sir we know about this, but we still don't know if we're going to have the xp drivers"" can't work it with my xp, so i'm stuck, great, well if i could only find their site, i would know if they have drivers already, but i can't find it... can some body help me???"
4,A stunning end to the series,"This disc contains a stunning end to a very sweet series. The art is consistantly good and the plot contains just enough sugar to satisfy. The extras are about in par with those on the other discs (that is to say, they aren't particularly fabulous)the english subtitles occasionally overlap the action in the last episode as the translated song lyrics create quite a subtitle pile up, and most of the action is happening low on the screen anyway. The english dubbing is pretty good. The voice acting is consistant and believable (for the most part). I would definately reccomend the entire series."
1,Karl Fulves must have had a bad day when he wrote this plop.,"If you think asking someone if they know where a certain word appears on a dollar bill is a magic trick, then this book is for you. Saying ""where does an anagram of White Snow appear on a dollar"" and then when they give up you point it out - is NOT MAGIC. It's not even a trick. Its just a rather sad puzzle or riddle.Most of the tricks in this book are that bad. A lot of them don't take more than 2 lines to explain in the book.There are a few good coin tricks, but they aren't 'self working' and involve palming. Some of the tricks aren't even coin tricks, they use bills. So its really money stunts.If this book had been called ""80 stunts that are rather cack and a couple of tricks that need some practise"" it might have been more honest - but then it wouldn't have sold.Fulves self working card trick books are awesome, but when it comes to coin magic he seems fairly clueless."
4,An Exhaustive Collection of Public Personnel Issues,"I recently read this book for a Ph.D. course, I found it to be quite exhaustive in coverage. From the beginnings of the public sector and the issues of spoils and patronage to the current issues of pay for performance, sexual harrassment and current public work trends, this book covers a great deal of subjects. Perhaps the most notable is the writers' ability to combine historical personnel issues with relative theories to argue current problems and situations. The second full reading really helped to clarify the book's thoughtful issues."
3,"Alright, kind of weak.","I would say spend a little more on a better pop filter. This one came in and really it isn't too great quality it just does what its supposed to. The rim for the screen is weak and the screen kind of sticks and pops out and the poseable arm that holds the screen up can barely do that, if you tap it it falls out of place. The knobs are plastic as well, and they seem like theyd wear out. It does do it's job for now, but it just isn't sturdy enough. When I have to get a new one I'd definitely spend on a more quality one."
1,Home Made Rubbish,"I wish I'd read the reviews before purchasing this film. I came to Amazon and when I did a search and found this title I thought great they've finally released a retail version. When it arrived my jaw dropped, this is rubbish, the home made sleeve still has white showing on the edge where it wasn't cut out properly and the disc is a DVD-R full face inkjet printable one. (Purple write surface) I thought if the film was at least good quality it wouldn't be so bad but it's not. It's quite poor, I got a better copy of this from video beat a few years back which no longer plays. These DVD-R disc's have a poor shelf life. This probably won't play in months or a couple of years. Returning this for a refund. How are people getting a barcode put on this crap. Where are the customs officials?"
1,Do not buy it.,"If you don't want to change the world with the Gospel read this book. It is theory. What is more that it is not good theory. It falls short of ""I am the way, the truth, and the life"" That is the bottom line."
2,Too long,"While this book is full of information, I found it to be too much for my class of wiggly 1st graders to listen to at read aloud."
4,Ambrose is a great story-teller.,I really enjoyed listening to this book on tape. This one is actually read by Ambrose. In this book he draws upon all his previous works and experiences to talk about friendship.
2,I Expected More,"Having read and enjoyed ""Undaunted Courage"" and after having heard Stephen Ambrose speak about the building of the transcontinental railroad, I really expected more than this book had to give. I thought it was a very lame attempt and that it was hastily thrown together. I doubt that it would have been published had it been written by anyone other than Mr. Ambrose. This book is not a good example of his talent."
4,Change of pace for Ambrose,"An interesting investigation into the relationships between men, and what bonds them together, especially in situations of threat such as conflict. Like his greatest books, THE VICTORS, CITIZEN SOLDIERS, BAND OF BROTHERS, or like great war novels, THE TRIUMPH AND THE GLORY, THE RED BADGE OF COURAGE, OR ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT, Ambrose seeks to understand and clarify the mystic connection that bonds men closer than brothers. He doesn't always hit the mark in this book but it is still a very worthwhile read."
1,cut and paste,"Agreed with the previous writer. Ambrose, one of my favorite historians, has merely assembled some passages from his past novels. Even if you had not read the full texts from which these anecdotes were taken, you'll be left empty as each section ends. Its just not compelling. JH"
3,A short study of friendship,"In Comrades, Stephen Ambrose delves into the topic of masculine relationships....fathers, brothers, pals, etc. Beginning with his relationship with his own brothers, he moves on to explore the relationships of more famous people...Eisenhower and Patton, Lewis and Clark, and even Richard Nixon (in this case, a look at why Nixon had no meaningful relationships with anyone). Most interesting though, is his coverage of the bonds and friendships formed between men who have served together in combat. It is a very short read, but well worth it just for the tid-bits of biographical information that typically would not be found in other history books."
1,a boring waste of time,"there are a bunch of these movies and if you get one the Amazon program will state that customers who bought this movie also bought these others. Unfortunately they are all the same with 5-6 very long sex scenes with exact matching simulated sex, oral sex, man doing her, her doing him, her sitting in his lap facing away. Never do any of these scenes have the missionary position. Basically the actors are never face to face. Is there a new union guideline forbidding to look one another in the face? Well anyhow they are all long boring so much so that the only way to stay awake is to fast forward them. And finally, if you want a plot forget it. The total dialog in this movie and the others is about as much as this review so you can guess how long and drawn out the lousy sex is to fill a 90 min. movie. If you are into silicone and wonder how much can be put into someone.... nothing natural or wholesome here"
5,I am an RP convert,"A few years ago there was that show Trucks! on SpikeTV, which I used to watch regularly. During one segment they had a quick story on Royal Purple products, which caught my interest. I contacted RP directly with questions on applicability of their fluids with my vehicles, and everything was compatible, except the ATF (my trucks require Dexron-6 and ATF+4.) I have been using their motor oil for about 53K miles in one truck and 51K miles in the other and planning to continue to do so. In addition, I switched all my vehicles to their gear oil (75W-90 and 75W-140.)"
4,very good,"This was hard to get into at first, but then I could not put it down. Dark, freaky, confusing but awesome!Glad I took the chance on something different!"
2,Too snarky and exaggerated for my taste,"I picked up this novel expecting a fluid, suspenseful spy thriller. Unfortunately, it reads like a first attempt at a pulp novel. The protagonist (Micah Dalton) is not believable as a ""real"" human being, much less like a veteran intelligence officer and professional ""cleaner."" I had to put the book down after a scene in which he kills two muggers in front of a small crowd of street urchins, only to burst into show tunes, a series of elaborate bows, and then shouting Shakespeare in the middle of the city streets at night - not exactly what you'd expect from someone whose job is to remove all traces that anything covert is under foot. Attempts at wit and cynicism by the author just come off as snarky and hyperbolic and story development is obscured behind spy/action film cliches. If you like your espionage cold, crisp, and intelligent, look elsewhere."
3,This is an author to keep an eye on.,"This fast-paced, action-filled novel introduces a new author and a new character to the covert-action library. Micah Dalton finds himself tracking down a CIA operative who apparently has gone bonkers and is killing off his former colleagues. This all involves some mind-altering substances and very gruesome murders. In fact Micah Dalton and his maniacal prey wreak enough slaughter for two or three such novels. As a dramatic device, it gets a bit excessive. The characters are well-developed, and the writing is good enough to make David Stone an author to keep your eye on."
3,Flawed but interesting,"The author deserves credit for the unique format of this book. At the same time, there are far too many innacurate details here. Crediting the Star Trek movie plots to the wrong films is the most glaring mix up. It really doesn't matter to me, I'm not fixated on the Star Trek franchise. I just hate to see shoddy writing and editing at any level. Overlooking these shortcomings, the book is rather entertaining to read."
4,Very thorough and balanced,Nicely done. Irreverent but fair to its subject. Excellent selection of photographs.
3,disappointed,"I ordered the ipod holder and armband a few weeks ago. I am still waiting for the armband to arrive in the mail. It was suppose to be placed in the package with the ipod holder but was left out. I have contacted the seller many times. The first time the seller sent the armband to the wrong address, and now I am still waiting for another one to be sent to me. This has been a very aggravating process and will not buy any other products from that buyer. Thank you."
1,Nothing more than a compilation of DANFS entries,"This book is nothing more than a collection of the ""Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships"" articles for transports and cargo ships, with an index by type. DANFS is public domain and is now available online at a couple of sites, including [...]"
3,"Good NOFX album, not their best...","""Punk In Drublic"" is good, but by far, not their best. In 1994 and 1995 Epitaph had a couple of releases that went really mainstream. Namely The Offspring's ""Smash"" and Rancid's ""...And Out Come The Wolves"". To say that this is NOFX's best release is by far wrong. It has it's moments, ""Lori Myers"", ""Linoleum"", ""Punk Guy"", those are classic NOFX. This album just doesn't hold enough water. This is one of my least listened to NOFX albums, next to ""Heavy Petting Zoo"". I think the mid-90's were a weird time for the punk rock scene in general. ""So Long and Thanks For All The Shoes"" was a great return to form. If you want to hear GREAT NOFX, skip their mid-90's work."
5,How Do They Sleep At Night?,"THIS CD RULES! One of the most superior punk albums to come out in years! FatMike and the boys totally tear the roof off with PunkInDrublic. Lemme see...songs like ""Leave It Alone"", ""Rico"", ""The Quass"", ""Linoleum""; they all reek of vintage NOFX. This is prime punk from NOFX. Vastly superior to the follow-up ""Heavy Petting Zoo"". So much so that it hurts. Get this CD, you crazy kids."
5,"Punk originated from London, England",Punk in Drublic has helped NOFX to become recognised in the original punk scene from England. This is by far there best albumn especially there cool attempt at punk/opera in 'My heart is yearning.' This is there best albumn but the others are also worth buying.
1,Terrible,This is not punk. this is music for skating posers. NEVER GET THIS ALBUM.....IT SUCKS!!!!!!!!!!
2,Neeeext...,"I bought this album when I was 20 and drinking a lot of crappy beer, it goes along perfectly with that mind set in that you don't haft to really do much thinking or worry about getting stimulated into thinking. It's pretty juvenile. What I'm trying to say is this, if you're still listening to and enjoying tripe like this when you're 25 and up than you got some developmental issues."
5,Greatest punk album in the world,"Easily, the best punk album ever. Not only is Fat Mike talented in writing important-message songs (Don't Call Me White, Happy Guy, Lori Myers), he can write hilarious songs as well (The Brews, Punk Guy, and Jeff Wears Birkenstocks). Every song is brilliant and tight. A must for any punk fan. If you like this, try their ""White Thrash, Two Heebs, and a Bean."""
3,"Comprehensive and effective, but slightly dull","This learning tool is a typical tape program. Very comprehensive, but slow moving and repetitive (I guess iteration is the key to learning). A good supplement to those trying to learn Portuguese, but not a primary material. The book itself is somewhat confusing."
5,Good book for people who want a glider,"I am a sugar glider owner, and I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in sugar gliders. It includes dietary information, care information, and even instructions for building a cage! The only problem I saw was that a picture caption mentioned letting gliders have a sock to sleep in, and that's a no-no, according to the breeders I talked to. Otherwise, this information is right on the money!"
1,Beware--This DVD may not work on your DVD player!,"This old James Garner/Lee Remick movie is enjoyable fluff -- if you can get it to work on your DVD player. Despite the way it was advertised it would not work on mine. (However, it can be watched on my computer.)"
3,Funny,"Haven't seen this one in ages but remember really enjoying it when I saw it on TV back in the 70's. One line has stuck with me all that time and it frequently comes to mind, anytime I'm asked how I want my meat cooked in a restaurant, in fact. When asked in a ritzy NYC restaurant how he wants his steak, Garner's character says, ""Burn it and bring me a bottle of ketchup,"" to the disdain of the snooty waiter. That's how I remember it, anyway. Not that this is how I would ever order a steak, but I am always tempted as a sort of tribute to this obviously memorable film."
4,Good Entry Level Book,"Excellent book for the basic reptile keeper to get an idea of what to expect and what to look for when caring for herps in thier care. Also a good source of info on things to watch out for when dealing with vets who may not be versed in herps such as certain meds to avoid, or problems experienced as well as common dosages. Most certainly a must have book for any herper's library."
3,not sure,got it fast - but after using it I seemed to have problems with my cell phone. Not sure what happened but it seems to make my phone drop calls.
4,looks good,Havent mounted it yet but seems to be quality. Came with all the proper hardware as well. I would recommend.
1,online insecurity,"You asked me to tell you what I think. I think a product should have quality standards to meet and the company that sells that product should have even higher standards to meet. Customer satisfaction is important. You ask me to focus my comments on the product. The IBM ThinkPad I purchased from Laptopcomponents through Amazon came to me in non working condition. Time is money. I bought another computer from elsewhere immediately afterwards. I requested a refund, not a repair or replacement. I have, so far,been denied this request. It is for this reason that I as well as many others, are nervous about buying on the internet. Thank you."
1,Be Warned: Track Listing Is Incorrect,"I ordered this CD based on the track listing posted here on Amazon. Unfortunately, the CD I received and the CD desribed here have only ONE TRACK (all the small things) in common! Also, the CD I received has only 20 tracks, while there are 23 tracks advertised here.After doing a little more research, it appears that there is a second CD also titled ""Supercharged"" and I am presuming at this point that the track listing posted here was mistakenly derived from the ""other"" Supercharged title.I went ahead and rated this CD anyway because I did listen to it briefly to see if I wanted to keep it even though it was not what I was expecting. In a word, ""Aaaargh!"" What a painful experience that was. This CD is total derivative rock/metal crap. Not only is there is no new ground broken here, the ""songs"" are superficial and abysmal.Move along, cause there's nothing to see here."
4,Much more than a recipe book,"In recent years there has been a growing hunger on the part of many readers for more information on the cultural and historical background of food. If you are such a reader, ""A Mediterranean Feast"" would be a welcome addition to your cookbook library. Along with traditional recipes from many regions, this massive volume offers extensive text on the history of Mediterranean food, including the influences of climate and geography. The book is handsomely produced, with maps and period""~ illustrations adding their own interest to the narrative."
3,"Difficult enterprise, difficult recipes","As a history book, even though Mr. Wright clearly knows a lot, he often seems a bit out of his depth, no doubt since the subject matter is so vast. Luckily, he invariably cites his sources, so the book could make a good jumping off place for someone curious to learn more. Given that this is a popular book, it is surprisingly sober and well-informed.The organization truly is crazy, and you will have to use the index.Most of the recipes seem to call for exotic ingredients andcomplicated preparation. Anyone hoping to use this book as a cookbook should have time on their hands, access to to well-stocked specialty grocery stores, and a willingness to make creative substitutions."
2,disappointing,"I honestly don't believe this qualifies as a Christian book. It seems to be an afterthought to the main charcter's personality. (she does go to a Bible study). I read about 30 pages into the book & have no desire to pick it up again. Ashley's main hobby is shopping for designer clothes-nothing wrong with that I guess, but-ugh, could you buy her a personality to go with her Prada purse? If you like chick lit, try Erynn Mangum instead."
2,Disappointed,"After all of the great reviews this book received, I decided to read but found it very hypocritical as a Christian. It is judgemental and materialistic and I was very turned off by that since it is clear that it is supposed to be a Christian foundation"
4,"Sweet, funny, and a good read","Having read all of Kristin Billerbeck's ""Ashley Stockingdale"" novels, I love them all. She's Out of Control is a great read, lighthearted and funny. All the things you could want in a chick-lit book -- plus some faith thrown in there."
5,12 years later..,"It's practically been 12 years and this is still the best Offspring CD and arguably the best ""punk"" cd. With the AMAZING guitar riffs and nice drum skills, this CD is worth listening to. You can also hear the bass unlike other poser bands. Buy this CD for the following AMAZING tracks:-Nitro(youth energy)-Gotta Get Away-Genocide-Come Out And Play-Self Esteem-SmashAll the rest of the songs are amazing but are not ""perfect."" This CD is for everyone of all ages, this is Punk Rock at its HIGHEST PEAK."
4,A pretty strong release,"Although Offspring is not one of the greatest bands out there, they did good on this album. It opens with three killer punk rockers (""Youth Energy"", ""Bad Habit"", ""Genocide"") which I just love to listen to. ""Come Out and Play"" is ""Pretty Fly for a White Guy"" minus all that mainstream sound. Almost every song's good, especially ""Self Esteem"" and ""So Alone"".The only problem with this album is that it suffers from what many punk rock albums do; tiredness. When you get over 40 minutes of the same sound, you sometimes get tired of it. I always find that it's more fun listening to individual songs than the whole album. That shouldn't stop you from buying this album. This is some good stuff. By the way, is ""Ixnay on the Hombre"" any good? I haven't bought it yet, and I was just wondering..."
2,"""Dumb"" punk rock","The Offspring often start off their live shows by announcing that they play ""dumb punk rock"". No argument here- that's what they do a lot of the time. Now, the Ramones never exactly claimed to be geniuses, which enables the ""dumb punk rock"" label to be a badge of honor of sorts. The Offspring are actually at their best when they aren't dumb. Basic maybe, but not dumb. Witness ""Self Esteem"", a funny-as-hell ditty about self-worth-- basic lyrics with basic music. Pick your spots carefully with this album, some songs are a lot better than others. Not bad overall, but not smashing."
5,Best Offspring CD,"Ive heard all the offspring cds except S/T and ixnay on the hombre, and ive gotta say this is the best! great lyrics and insane guitar will define this album. My personal favorite songs are itll be a long time, Bad Habit and Gotta get away. if you are even remotely into this type of music, buy this CD. it could quite possibly be one of the greatest albums ever made"
2,Typical Offspring album,"This album is just like all their others, it has about four of the best songs you could think of and 10 other songs that suck. That's how all their albums go, but when their songs are good, their really good."
4,"This is true Offspring, not Americana","Any self-respecting Offspring fan would agree, this CD is Offspring at its best. They wrote the lyrics they wanted to write, and didn't care if it went mainstream. This CD wasn't ""Nevermind"", but it was far better then Americana and most other CD's manufactured today."
5,Greatest album in history,I had heard of offspring back in the day but never listened to one of their cd's. Then the other day I purchased their cd from amzon and since then I have listened to it at least 4 hours a day! I love this album and wouldn't take it out of my cd player even if the world was coming to an end. If you like good music this is the cd to buy. I can't believe I almost missed out. Don't make the same mistake as me buy it this instant! Offspring is the greatest band to ever walk this earth and this is their greatest cd!
5,great,"This is easily as good or better than Americana. The songs are extremely catchy and hard, esp. Bad Habit, Self Esteem, Come out and Play, and What Happened to You. Great road rage lyrics on Habit. While I don't agree that they've sold out(there it is again), this cd probably is better than their new one."
5,The Essential Offspring Album!,"When I first heard The Offspring, it was the horrible pop abomination Americana. However, at the time I liked it, and that led to me buying some of their other CD's, and I found out how much they really ROCK! Ixnay on the Hombre is cool, and the new album is alright, but this is the album to buy. The music is still somewhat unrefined (in a good way), and the band hasn't started to become poppy yet. This isn't ""Pretty Fly"", this is real punk-rock/alternative. If you even remotely like the band, I will tell you now: YOU NEED THIS CD. Buy it, now. Don't finish reading this review, just buy it. You have my stamp of approval. Every song is cool, especially ""Gotta Get Away"", ""Bad Habit"", ""Self Esteem"", and ""Smash"". But they all are really cool, so it doesn't matter which ones I like. A must-have, plain and simple."
4,Live Like There Is No Tommorow,"Smash is good, but is not the Offspring's best. I play guitar and know Smash like the back of my hand. I notice that a lot of the album sounds the same with not much variation in between. The best is Ixnay on the Hombre, where they incorporated all of their skills into one kick-ass album. Buy Smash, but don't expect to be blown away!"
5,the best ...,cool show ...does any one know when season 2 is coming out ? can u let me know i liked the story lines and for its time its well done
2,no ironhorse,one of the best characters in season 1 was paul ironhorse played by richard chavez. in season 2 the actor was killed off in the premiere episode. i like adrian paul but they should have kept richard chavez. another character that was killed off needlessly was norton drake.
5,So much better than season 1...,This season is a post-alien-invasion-apocalypse action show...Don't let dreadful season 1 keep you from really good season 2.It's like a whole different show!!!
4,"Season 1 was horrendous, Season 2 a great improvement","As bad as Season 1 was (bad acting, directing, writing, production, stories etc), Season 2 showed a complete turn-around from the mess of the first season, much better production, writing, and cinematography, a darker season and just 1000% more watchable than Season 1."
5,"The almighty Emperor, witness the blasphemy live.","First of all, to put down a few misconceptions. Emperor is not satanic, nor are they death metal. They are true Nowregian Black Metal. This DVD is a compilation of songs including ""Curse you all men!"", ""I am the black wizards,"" ""With Strength I Burn"" and more. Emperor is by far one of the most powerful bands in the scene, becuase they stay true to the music, not the image. Notice the lack of corpse paint. Seeing Emperor live, especially now since they've broken up, is an experience any true fan would pay any amount of money for. This is your chance. Excellent haul if you purchase this DVD"
4,Good reference book,This is a great desktop book. It isn't as comprehensive as I would like but it's definitely a good start.
1,Useless for anyone outside of Microsoft,"This book reads like an intenal Microsoft document written to assist their tech writers write Microsoft manuals. Too Microsoft-centric. If you want to write tech manuals for Microsoft or manuals that feature Microsoft products and functions and want to follow all of Microsoft's style guidelines, then this book is great. For the rest of the world, useless."
5,You've got to come to a seminar,"A) the book is excellent. This is a great intro into the world of preassure points, but seeing Dillman in person helps to cement in the things talked about. Also, the seminars go way beyond what's written. The book will not do you much good if you do not go to one of the seminars-----at least once, if not more often than that. I've only been to 2 of his seminars and have felt some of the knockouts. Some of the info presented in the book dovetailed nicely with things I've learned from instructors.B) People who don't believe that you can ""catch a fist"" in a real fight or do any of the more amazing-sounding things (including, dare I say it, actually wound a person by kicking above the waist----high-kicking, for the record, is not a part of Dillman's systems) have not seen or experienced enough. It'll work. I've actually caught fists with my hands before I knew it was supposedly a kenpo technique.Bottom line: buy the book."
4,"A Great ""GREATEST HITS"" CD!","This is definitely a great ""greatest hits"" CD! It contains so many great songs like ""Swear it again"", ""Flying without wings"", ""Against All Odds"", ""Unbreakable"" etc. And in this version they exclusively included another version of ""Flying without wings"" that features BoA, a korean diva who's well-known in Asia (Wonder if anybody in USA know about her). She sounds amazing in this song! I've always and still think it's a bad idea for Westlife to sing fast songs or raps, and thank god in this greatest hits cd most of the songs are slow ones. It's a shame though that they didn't have some other really great songs like ""Evergreen"" or ""Angel"" included on it, otherwise this could have been a perfect CD, and which is why I rated the CD as 4 stars instead of 5. Overall, I think this CD is worth the money and would recommend it to anyone who loves Ballads. If you've never had an album of Westlife, then this is the CD you have to buy!"
3,Works,"This stuff works but it takes a while to feel the effects. Stick with it. If you want faster results, you probably should look elsewhere."
5,the cycle is complete,"Well it took 14 years, but this 5 disc volume completes the 32 disc collection of Haydn symphonies.As with the previous volumes this one is fully digital, the technical quality of these discs is excellent.I have all 8 volumes and have been happy with every one of them.The sounds of Adam Fischer and the Austro-Hungarian Orchestra are splendid. This group of symphonies (21-39) is quickly becoming one of my favorites."
3,"Worked, but a disappointment","This is an easy to setup chair. I would not suggest for backpacking because it is bulky. I liked using mine in outdoor social events, like car camping and watching sports. I can't use it anymore, becuase the poles included were cheap and broke within a year. Once those are gone it is not as comfy."
1,Sloppy Stuff- Not For Beginners,"I'm new to Premiere so I thought this book looks rather promising.I have to admit I haven't read the whole book. I'm still stuck at chapter 1 ('Premiere Quickstart'), and that's because the steps given are not entirely in sequence, some important labels in the diagram are missing (where's the thread area you're talking about?), and things work out differently than described.In summary, this book (at least the first chapter) is a sloppy piece of work. Don't touch it if you're a beginner."
5,Good Purchase,"Thia was a gift for my son, & he liked it. It fit well & arrived earlier than expected. I'm well satisfied with this purchase."
4,"I prefer ""...And Out Come The Wolves"", but this is still great!","""Let's Go"" is a great album full of true punk energy, attitude and spirit. I personally prefer ""...And Out Come The Wolves"" because the songwriting is better and more of the songs stick out, but this is still a great album. ""Let's Go"" is less about the ska influence than it is about playing faster, power-chord punk rock. As I said, the songwriting on ""...And Out Come The Wolves"" is better, but for straight-up street-punk, you can't go wrong with this album! Get it, crank it, love it! Thanks for the time, and peace."
5,Literally Perfect,"This album is literally the perfect punk rock record. Everytime I listen to it I can't help but sing along, because every song is so damn catchy. Some people complain about 23 songs being simply too much, but I think too many songs are better than too little.Buy this album, you won't regret it!"
4,"good, not yet great","The one that brought punk into the mainstream, this is almost as good as out come the wolves. a lot better than life won't wait, and is definately worth buying. Salvation, Radio, you need this album. I say not yet great because i think that out come the wolves is incredible, and this is almost as good."
4,"Part history, part travelogue, part mystery","This novel is a combination of Soviet history, travelogue, and murder mystery. I would argue that the weakest part of the story is the murder mystery- Renko spends much of his time in the Exclusion Zone, by his own admission, accomplishing nothing. And then the author employs the shopworn technique of the baddie explaining everything to Renko just before he is to kill him. The novel earns four stars for its indictment of the Soviets' monstrous indifference to the population in the wake of Chernobyl, as well as Smith's depiction of life in the Zone's radioactive villages."
4,Good old Renko,"The author has done a great job of creating and sustaining Arkady Renko, an alternately cynical and idealistic Russian investigator who gets caught, time and again, in the dark side of life. It's funny that a common element in the Renko books is that every character around him seems to dislike or distrust him, for he seems eminently likable to me.It had been a while since I'd read the last Renko novel and I feared the latest installment would disappoint. Though Wolves Eat Dogs begins slowly and the characters were at times confusing (is there any good guy here?), eventually the tension grew until it became a real page turner. The bits with Zhenya, an orphan boy Renko unwillingly befriends, and the many little zinger comments about modern Russian life are particularly fun and thought provoking. A good modern crime novel, good continuation of the series, with interesting insights into the history of Chernobyl."
3,Too confusing,"Wolves Eat Dogs is too much trouble to read - takes too much effort. Most of the dialogue seems disconnected, like a dream."
4,A mystery in the wasteland,"I have really liked all of Smith's Renko novels, but this one was not as good as the others. Too bleak a landscape perhaps. Still worth reading, especially for those who liked Gorky Park, Polar Star, Havana Bay and Red Square. But, raad those first."
4,Good story line,"The story line of Chernobyl and corruption was an excellent one, but the set of wooden characters was a disappointment. I'd recommend this anyway, a very interesting read."
3,Renko depressed and depressing,"In this novel Arkady Renko seems out of sync in the New Russia of capitalists and Mafia.Ostensibly the novel is about an investigation of the deaths of Pasha Ivanov,President, and subsequently the senior vice-president, of NoviRusk, a rising Russian firm. It appears that Ivanov has committed suicide and even Renko believes that for most of the novel. But why? A search for the answer takes Renko to the Exclusion Zone around Chernobyl where sanctioned workers and unsanctioned residents live a surreal existence. At this point the novel loses its way and meanders into an examination of the meaning of life. Eventually Renko untangles the relationship of one of the key characters in the second half of the novel to the dead men in the first half but only after you wonder whether he will emerge from the wasteland around Chernobyl. Definitely not Cruz Smith's best novel but still worth reading!"
3,Lousy Plot; Fascinating Travelogue,"I'm being generous with my 3-star rating, only because I am fascinated by the phenomenon of post-Chernobyl society, such as it is, which he catalogs faithfully, I guess. So, read it as a travelogue, not a compelling novel. The plot was too obtuse, the characters unreal, and even Arkady has morphed into a caricature of himself. I've liked all of Cruz Smith's books, but this one is the author's Chernobyl, in more ways than just the obvious."
1,horrible blu-ray transfers,"It's sad that the DVDs from several years ago actually look much better than these ""new"" blu-ray transfers. Hopefully Universal will re-release these at some point in the future with better transfers and will exchange them with those of us who have already purchased this set."
2,Great Movies - LOUSY Picture Quality on Blu-Ray!,"1st movie...I cannot state harshly enough my disgust when major money makers like these films come to Blu-Ray with lousy, GRAINY picture quality... Totally ruins my viewing experience. Every single indoor scene with low lighting... GRAINY!!! Every outdoor scene with back lighting... GRAIN! Every outdoor scene with low lighting... GRAIN!!!2nd and 3rd movies...Grain Not as bad... Some scenes a little blury tho. Sound quality is fine.Over all... it's good I got this set on sale!"
5,AWESOME!!!,"Really great bluray. I love all 3 Jurassic Park movies and had to purchase this. Blu ray.com had a sale on it and just couldn't resist, This is has a great 7.1 DTS HD track on them."
5,Great Combo Pack,"I've owned the DVD trilogy for a while now and wasn't sure what to expect as far as a difference between the two versions and let me tell you the Blu Ray is amazing. The sound and video quality is amazing, and with movies like Jurassic Park the sound is a vital part of the experience!"
5,Best franchise ever!,The Jurassic Park series are great along with directors Steven Spielberg and Joe Johnston. I love the dinosaurs and also the characters in these films. It always make me feel happy when watching again and again whenever I feel like it.
1,Does not Come with Ultraviolet code,Does not Come with Ultraviolet code point less unless u like hard copies but also the movies are awesome !!!
3,nice packaging,"Nice packaging,original,however it is American region version,so can't play in my main DVD PLAYER but play in my other ones. Love the movies"
1,It's not a trilogy.,"There is only two Jurassic park films( Jurassic park and The Lost World) Jurassic Park 3 was so bad that it should not be mention in the same breath as the first two. My Opinion, wait intill They make a real part 3 to this series."
5,Jurassic Park Ultimate Trilogy,These films are some of the technology of the advancement of film. Dinosaurs so real and the surrounding sounds of the jungle backgrounds is amazing. For those of us who have home theater. I recommend this DVD trilogy pack to fellow officianados.
4,Looks Great,I don't Think I need to say a lot about the films because I think just about every person that watches movies have seen these films. The transfers to blu ray look very good I have seen better but they are very good the extras are great. I have never actually owned any of these films and have not seen them in a very long time. So I decided to finally buy them and I'm glad I did because I love these films they are very entertaining and bring back wonderful memories of my childhood. I would definitely recommend buying them on blu ray.
5,One of The Best,"This is the coolest pack of movies ever. My family recently got a big screen TV, so we waited for all of the Jurassic Park movies to come out on DVD and when we noticed that it came with a third extra tape, we were even more happy! The movies are so cool, I am so into Jurassic Park. Plus, there are drop-dead gorgeous guys in the film, so it makes it even more romantic...I mean scary. The CG dinos look so real, and I think that Joe Johnson really made Spielberg proud. It's a classic."
1,"The worst blu-ray transfer ever, incredibly grainy!","As a Jurassic Park fan, I couldn't wait for the blu-ray release of these films. What a disappointment! I have over 200 blu-rays, and this is the worst transfer I have ever seen. The picture is incredibly grainy, worse than my old DVD's of the films. Universal should be ashamed at the lack of effort that went into this blu-ray release. I have much older blu-rays from them, including ""The Blues Brothers"" (1980), that look fantastic, but this one looks like a vhs transfer that has been played 100 times. Absolutely terrible."
2,"All widescreen, but only #3 has DTS track",Wait for them to put out a trilogy with ALL movies in DTS. You REALLY want DTS for THESE movies.
1,Tall white looking able-bodied women and men enjoy...,"I am a disabled person. If it weren't for the threat of being sued I would have a heck of a lot less ability to leave my house than I do now. The only thing bigots are worried about are the lawyers. The police have never defended me or my rehabilitation friends other than to say ""just don't go back"" to the restaurant or store or oceanside park.People in aggregate are NOT very nice. One good accident (not your fault) and you can find that out for yourself."
1,Punk guru,"This album is, like the rest of their work, horrendous. How any musician would rightfully want any credit for this is beyond my conception. The vocals are horrible, they are out of tune, pitch and the articulation of the words is dispicable. If you want to hear a example of a bad early 90's punk band buy it. If you have any musical taste then definitely skip this one. For something good on Epitaph look for something like Bad Religion, Pennywise, or Nofx."
1,Computer Generated Music,"There was one memorable, original theme on both CD's, that of Way O Way. The rest sounded like a combination of out right rip-offs of popular artists mixed in with lame computer geek imitations of Moby. If you are any kind of musician, skip this."
3,Great songs but...,"Why the remastering? What happened to the Definitive edition Remasters (DER)? Did someone decide they werent so ""definitive""?Tracks remixed by Nick Davis definatly sound different but not true to the original mix. The tracks from self titled Genesis album sounds as if the volume was maxed out to give the impression that it was remastered but as far as I can tell still sounds like the first cd version released may years ago.Great songs but if your a genesis fan you probably have most of these songs to begin with and the DER are easy to find and sound wonderfull."
3,I Qube,"The IQube lasted a little longer than the the last dog toy we bought. Roxy and Madison, my 2 Australian Shepherds, give it 2 paws out of 4. The objects had great squeakers but one died the first day of play. The other ones lasted about 3 to 4 days each. The cube itself is still being used to stuff other toys into yet it has holes and is losing stuffing from time to time. The smaller toys aren't long in lifespan but the cube is moderate. Decent toy. If you want a better toy with the same concept go for the squeaky squirrels in the tree stump the same manufacturer makes. That one is worth it.This one is decent overall."
1,Uh.................these books actually sell?!?,"I've always heard of Danielle Steel but never read any of her work. Then a box of books was given to me by a neighbor and in it was Malice, so I started to read. I was honestly stunned - the writing was absolutely the worst I've ever seen! I wanted to get out my editing pencil and correct the horrible grammar, the fragmented and poorly-worded sentences, and cross out the numerous repeat sentences. The story-line was nauseating and the ending completely predictable. It was like a glorified Harlequin romance, but not as well written as a Harlequin. I've seen better writing from middle school students, and I'm not even exaggerating. It's baffling that Danielle Steel makes money on her books. But as a friend in my book club said, ""there's a lot of simple-minded people in this world and there's got to be books out there for them too."" I guess that's as good an explanation as any for how Danielle Steel books actually sell."
3,I've entered the Rabbit Hole ...,"Picked up the hard copy version for $1 at the local library and it was $1 well spent. I was leery as I've always thought of Danielle Steel as complete romance but this tale had raw emotions entwined. I really did enjoy it---- but please note that I felt the writing was infantile at times & the editing left alot to be desired. In addition, be prepared to feel exhausted at the trials of the main character. I can't imagine anyone getting kicked in the gut so many times and still have such an honest, innocent outlook - this part left me feeling like I've entered the rabbit hole....other than that, it's a decent tale and a very quick read."
3,Not as good as about time or live at the key club,In the summer of 2002 i wanted this c.d for my birthday. I didn't get it but i wasn't mad for long. I ordered the c.d. becuase it would have been hard to find it in a store. I got the c.d and i had already heard unknown road and homesick and though that they were cool.This has got to be the worst Pennywise c.d. vocally ever. I think theyre bassist Jason thirsk was singing on it. Most of the songs seem to be about hating rules. musically this c.d. is not that great from what i remember. I havent listened to this c.d. in a long time. Dont buy this c.d unless you want to make your Pennywise c.d collection complete.
2,More Depth Needed,"I agree wholeheartedly with the premise of ""The Gift of Shyness"" -shyness is a positive not a negative condition and shy people everywhere have something to offer the world -- sensitivy and intelligence. That's the good of the book. The problem is a lack of depth and too much repetition. I couldn't finish the book due to the writing style. It sounds like it was written for middle school kids."
1,"While the SuperfoodsRx Book is terrific, the recipe book blows.","The recipes in this book are simply not healthy for you. There is no nutritional breakdown as to fat content and calories at the bottom of every recipe. I agree with the others who have left reviews in saying to check online for healthy recipes using the Superfoods, the cookbook is a huge disappointment."
3,"A Little Disappointed, Eh","Prettily written, but not at all cohesive. On the jacket it describes him finding the watch, but this story takes up a mere chapter or two of the book. The rest are interviews, anecdotes, and personal stories. Not at all expected, but decent."
3,Very good book from an Investigation point of view,"As a USS Stark FFG31 Plank Owner, I found the book informative, but, somewhat biased toward the Investigators point of view. I believe that the book would have been much better had the Authors interviewed the Crew members since apparently there was a little too much reliance on the ""Official documents."" Hopefully, some enterprising Author will do this and publish another book from the Crew Members perspective."
2,Not Worth the Money,"Their first album was extremely solid and so I figured this cd would at least be good. I was wrong. I have forced myself to keep listening to it in hopes that it will grow on me, but it won't. I only found one awesome song and that is ""Tomorrow"". The rest of the album is just plain boring with no great melodies and hooks. Don't recommend it."
5,Outstanding songs and performance,"This group should be on top of the world! The album has several tracks that are too good for words, especially track 3, ""My World."" This is a crossover to more popular music, and sounds like a surefire bet to become a movie soundtrack. Track 1, ""All Fall Down"" is my second favorite. There is one song, I think it's track 11, and it sounds like it could have been written by The Beatles, especially the final 45 seconds of the song. Mitch Allan has written some great stuff, he has really matured since ""Now You See Inside."" I highly recommend this album."
3,CD original but....,"The CD Case came in bad condition, it doesn't look new..., I don't think it is, but what the hell, CD Came in almost perfect condition and sounds Perfect and that all that matters..."
2,Generic and bland,"Generic and bland album by Kotzen. He played and wrote everything here, there is not aven a band credited. I assure, there is absolutely nothing spectacular here; even the solso are dumb and pedestrian. A total dissapointment. (oh, his vocals are good)"
4,Inspiring,"The photographs and instructions in this book are very inspiring, and overall mostly everything you need to know about melt and pour soap crafting is covered. This book will inspire you to create some beautiful soaps. My only (minor) complaint would be that I would have liked to see a few more recipes that were more practical, rather than simply decorative."
3,OK,Really a bit outdated but was interesting to read. I would want to know the copyright on any other soaping book I bought.
4,"The Few, The Proud, The Marines","""The Marines"" is a well-produced piece that gives a great overview of the process of making a Marine, both enlisted and officer level. This video will provide a background for gaining an understanding into the culture of the Marine Corps. Highly recommended."
3,"ok, but only fits two very small rods","This case can fit two light action rod and reel combos adequately. However, they have to be pretty small for both of them to fit. If one of your rods has large eyes or a reel bigger than a 2000 series, you'll likely be out of luck. The length and quality is quite good, but the tube is really narrow.If you like to travel with more than one rod, you might consider getting two of these to use to transport them individually."
2,Disappointing,"The local information given here is not very helpful and sometimes even misleading. National monuments ( like Tumacacori Mission in arizona) and even gated state historic sites, some with museums such as the ruins of the Old Tubac Presidio in Arizona are listed as though they were abandoned ghost towns. There is some good information here but it's hard to know which information you can trust. The problem is, that unless you are personally familiar with a particular area the information here can be sketchy at best and woefully out-of-date or misleading at worst. I think this book was ""slapped together"" with more thought given to selling books than to careful research. If you just want to know the names of places, lost mines or ghost towns in a given area this will work, but if you want much more information than that... you're on your own."
2,The Insider's Guide to San Miguel,"This travel guide to San Miguel de Allende was written in 2004 and not as up-to-date as I was wanting for a visit there in March 2010. Hopefully, street names, shops and restaurants have not changed much in six years. I was expecting a more current edition of the book."
1,Don't waste your money for this one,"Don't waste your money buying this popcorn maker. does not pop well, burns the corn, hard to clean."
4,The beginning of greatness,"For those who have only heard Rancid on the radio and MTV, this is your chance to hear how it began. From unbelievably catchy bass lines, powerful drumming and guitar riffs, and of course Tim Armstrong's trademark guttural, scorching vocals. This is the album that has the transition of Operation Ivy into the band that saved Punk from turning into pop."
4,A great punk album,"This is Rancid's first album before they polished their sound.This is a raw,hard hitting,in your face punk rock album.Rancid follows with stronger efforts but this is still worth your money if you like this kinda music.Tim Armstrong started as and still is a masterful songwriter and musician.This is shorter and heavier than the rest but I really enjoyed it."
4,Wedding peach,"I give wedding peach 4 stars because its is a exciting book that keeps the reader looking for more and what's next. I personally haven't seen weeding peach the DVD,but the Graphic novels were great.I also recommend DVD: princess nine, Chobits, Berserk, Argentosoma, Escaflowne, Someday's Dreamers, and Full Metal Panic"
3,not very easy to use,"I found it annoying having to waste ten minutes walking to the opposite end of the area to find a deer. Deerhunter allows you to just click and drag yourself to wherever. Also, the maps do not show the location of the bridges so, if you shoot an animal and it runs across the river(which the hunter cannot) you have to potentially go all the way across the game to find the bridge, cross it, go all the way back, and bag your claim,while the other animals have conveniently made their way to the opposite side again...."
5,Great hold @ a great price!,"This gel is the only kind that works in my hair, and recently Walmart stopped supplying it. Thankfully I found it here on Amazon and for even less money! It holds for days and doesnt leave a sticky residue on me."
2,Disappointing,"This book had some good concepts, but overall I was pretty disappointed by it. It moves quickly from practical suggestions for identifying potential areas of ministry to over spiritualized strategic level warfare, which focuses more on the enemy than anything else. The appendix (which takes up more than half the book!) has some helpful tables in it, but for the most part it wasn't very helpful."
1,"A quick read, but shallow","Strathern's summary of the life of Issac Newton is less than 90 pages of unusually large print -- a very quick read indeed. At best, it is a superficial glance that provides little insight into the life or work of Newton.In many ways, the book is a contradiction. Strathern's approach is more suited to a children's book, but his writing style is intended for an educated adult. For me, the result was fast-paced boredom."
2,Ok book,"If you are looking for a book on sparring look some where else, but if you looking for a book that talks about the philosophy of the martial arts this is the book. Nearly throughout this whole book Mr. Johnson uses examples from his life to explain how the philosophy of the martial arts can help people get through life in general. However, the book can be very hard to read, not because it is written like Shakespeare, but because it contains many grammatical errors that can confuse the reader of what Mr. Johnson's point is. In addition, some of the ideas Mr. Johnson tries to profess are not explained at all. Don't get me wrong the book is good but it has many errors in it."
1,Cheap Imitation of Product Ordered!,"Buyer beware! Although this comes in an Artland shipping box, the glasses are actually RuffHewn brand and are a cheap imitation of Artland. They are thinner and inferior quality.This was a replacement order for the same glasses I received initially.I ordered our current glasses from another site and received the correct product which is much thicker glass and superior quality. These are not a match with the current glasses.Sending back."
4,Perfect addition - bought both tall and short.,"Very nicely made we bought a full set of tall and short. Color is true to the photo - slate blue. We like the heavy weight and solid bottoms. Easy to wash, safe for the dishwasher. Good everyday glass - worth the price."
5,Sta-Bil,"I am glad this is offered in this small bottle. If I were stuck buying larger bottles, the rest would go to waste for no more than I use it."
4,I LLLOOOOVVVEEE this series!,I like this book because it has some fights and its pretty cool. I hope that everyone who has heard of DB should read it. But some of it has sexual humor.... I hate that. I wish it didn't have that. It is packed full of surprises.
4,Tplace to start for those who are curious about DBZ,"When you open up the ""first"" volume of DBZ in either format they say that it is not the first part of sieries but the second(infact the volume number of it in the over all storyline is 17).Your probably going ""huh?"" in all fairness this is the better satrting point not just story wise, but it also is a great set of incidents in its own rights.So why only four? I never said it was the best story Period."
3,skip this video if you are in good shape,"A bit too cute for me, the pregnacy rap was awful. The strength part was great, but the aerobics are not a good enough workout if you are in good shape. I kept waiting for it to pick up. Good tape if you are new to working out, skip it if you are already in good shape or can't stomach the cuteness."
1,"old, and not worth it","kathy smith is a classic, but this prego video is overly annoying, almost as bad as a denise austin video, the outfits are hideous and the workout seems rather off the beatne path for a pregnant woman, i did not feel like my body was getting what it needed, i do not recommend it"
1,So Boring and Cheesy,"This is my first Kathy Smith Video and I was sorely disappointed. I tried the video two times and I got so bored I stopped using it.It did get my heart rate up a little which was good.In the middle of the video, the pregnant moms start ""rapping"" about baby stuff, with Kathy Smith wearing a cap and sunglasses, I thought it was so cheesy.I recommend Sheva Rose's Prenatal Yoga, which kept me fit and prevented me from gaining ANY extra weight."
2,boring!,"This is 1980's basic aerobics at it's cheesiest. I understand the need to take things easier when pregnant and modify your workout moves for safety, but for someone who is used to fast-paced, exciting workouts like Tae-Bo, this was just way too ""Jazzercise"" for me. Not only was it too slow, but the moves and music were just really boring. I did the workout once and haven't put it back in. A brisk walk through the neighborhood does more for me, both aerobically and mood-wise."
1,Ummm...no.,"What is up with that ridicuolous ""prego rap""?! And the 5 mintues of silent time where all we see is kathy & the others laying on the floor for 5 WHOLE MINUTES! There are parts where the voice is dubbed over, the exercises were not effective AT ALL & the arm moves get a bit confusing at times. I just didn't find myself sweating or even feeling somewhat energized after this routine...I felt cheated. Like I needed more. It is way too outdated too. I almost wanna call it lame. I DO NOT recommend at all. Obviously I wasn't impressed & will be selling my copy on ebay."
1,"retro video, not up to date with prenatal safety","i did this video 12 years ago and enjoyed it ok, but bought the dvd during my last pregnancy last year and found so much of the material to be toooo retro for me, too unsafe. Some of the things she does do not appear to be as safe as what my doctor tells me. A newer video would do you much better."
1,Very Hokey,This workout was way too old and hokey for me. It needs to be updated quite a bit to be more current.
5,"Old, but effective and enjoyable","I love this workout video! It is old, with cheesy music and outfits and a horrible rap in the middle, but it is still a GREAT video. Kathy is a really good instructor. She is clear and encouraging without being annoying like the instructor in a newer pregnancy workout video I have. The routines have enough variety to keep from being boring, and it does give a pretty good workout. I have to admit, I usually turn down the TV and listen to something else so I don't have to hear the music, but I still give this video 5 stars for a great, effective workout that I've used through two pregnancies and started using with a third."
4,Pretty Good Workout,"I only use this video once every couple of weeks so it never really gets old. The 80's outfits and definitely different, but overall it is a great workout. It's pretty easy so I am never sore the next day. I like that it incorporates both cardio and weights unlike several pregnancy workouts that I have tried. I am 31 weeks along and don't have any problems performing any of the moves in this video!"
2,What's all the fuss about?,"I bought this video after reading tons of rave reviews not only from this site but in several pregnancy magazines. After purchasing the video and trying the workout, I have to wonder, what is all the fuss about? 10 years ago this video may have been ""it"", but if you ask me it's completely outdated. The music and Jazzercise-atmosphere is barely tolerable. Don't get me wrong it's not the worst workout video I've ever used, but I definitely don't understand all of the high recommendations. If you want an up to date pregnancy workout that WORKS, try Fit Mama, which is available here at Amazon."
2,Cheap = Low Quality,"These cameras work but are very low quality. The picture is fuzzy but you are able to see for the most part during the daytime. The nightvision does not work well at all, and none of the problems I have had are due to interference since I have my nanny cam receiver in the same location and get a chrystal clear picture with it."
2,Great if you intend on transmitting only a few feet,"I will keep this brief. The item has very good ""night vision"" attributes. Beyond that I would not recommend it if you plan on placing the camera more than a few feet from the receiver. Yes, that's correct; no more than a few feet (less than 10 ft). I've tried it in more than one location and had the same results. Unless the camera and receiver have direct line of site and are no more than several feet apart, the picture suffers from a great deal of static and flicker."
2,Disapointing Effort,"This is a sub average Torchlight cinema advertised as staring Nicole Oring.. She is in it and the best part of it, BUT, she is not featured more than any of the other participants. Soft core, no plot to speak of and long simulated sex scenes.I would rate this as a ""D"" {below average} effort. If you are looking for realism..two of the actresses were noticably ordinary in appearance and had asthetic flaws. I blame the director for choosing poor camera angles as the simulated sex was sometimes anatomically out of allignmnent and obviously faked.Girl on Girl seemed to be about 2/3rds of the Movie. There were three heterosexual scenes, Nicole Oring was in the only one that was well done."
3,pea,"I was sent soy by American Health Supplies. Not a great transaction at all, but they made it right in the end."
2,Negative Reaction,"I tried and tried to use this product but could not adjust to it. Within a half hour of ingesting it I would get a searing headache and brain fog which would last most of the day. I tried using half the amount recommended to work my way up to it, but still the headache and brain fog, to the point of feeling high. Something in this formulataion just did not agreen with me, and I ended up throwing it out."
2,taste like pea soup,"ive been using the vanilla soy and its good tastingwith apple juice, so i thought id give this apple one a try.its aweful. i tried it every way , with milk, water, apple juice, orange juice.unless you like pea soup, dont get this one, buy the vanilla."
3,Yuck,"I'm not a fan of shakes in the first place but this one is pretty bad.I tried choc shake mix + water + peanut butter = discustingchoc Shake mix + milk + vanilla yogurt = not as discustingMaybe banana next, needs to be sweeter, still I don't think the flavor can be coveredI'm promised myself I will drink for a week to see how I feel..."
2,Hence the name....,From a nutritional standpoint it is great. But as the name states PEA protein is the taste you get. I like to call it a dehydrated pea and ovaltine chocolate taste.
4,Teaching Percussion,This book is a very good resource for those who are going to be teaching music or about percussion. All the information in the book is detailed.
3,"Bought for a Class, but not light, fun reading.","Cook's book is very, very dry reading. It is too wordy and not very non-percussionist friendly. I purchased this as a requirement for my Advanced Percussion Techniques Class. Not recommended for someone looking for an easy read before having to teach beginning percussionists."
1,Piece of Junk!! Don't Buy It!!,"Marketing would lead you to believe this is a RAID card. It is not.""Adaptec Serial ATA II RAID 1420SA card is a four-port controller featuring Adaptec HostRAID""""HostRAID"" is when the card uses the system hardware to do the calculations. Its not true RAID from the card.If you run any flavor of Linux, it will be that much more useless. Since Amazon reminded me with an email to do a review, I will see if I can still return it.Worthless piece of junk. I wish Adaptec, who used to be a respectable company, would be clear on what this card actually does.""...an integrated RAID technology that maximizes system performance and uptime. The Adaptec 1420SA supports up to four 3Gb/s Serial ATA drives, Native Command Queuing, and offers RAID levels 0, 1, 10, and JBOD (individual drive). The Adaptec 48-bit logical block addressing (LBA) support enables use of disk drives exceeding 137 GB in capacity.""I call B.S.[...]"

5,Great book,I really like this book the auther really put a lot of insight into her bok and talked about the weather and hardship along the way. its a really good book
4,"Like the title says, Straw Bale Details","If you're interested in strawbale building this is a nice little book on many of the details involved.The first 20 or so pages tell about various facets of the concept, they're followed by several short chapters (each with a written detail section)on things like walls, windows, foundations, electrical wiring and so on. Each of these sections consists primarily of architectural detail drawings of the chapter subject.There's a lot of detail here but I don't think it's enough for the total novice to go out and build from. You(if you're a novice)will need a lot more information on construction than is provided here. I guess that Amazon probably has all of the books you'll need, I think they do have all of the strawbale books listed in the short bibliography, those are worth a look."
2,Could do better,This game could do alot better than it really did. It takes way to long to build something or to train something. But it has a good storyline where its humans against orcs. I do enjoy watching them battle it out and ending in a gory death. The land isnt detailed enough. What this game lacks is details.
5,The Essential Strategy Game,"This is perhaps one of the best games of all time. The gameplay is well-balanced and simple, but the game is suitable for all skill levels. If you are interested in Real-Time Strategy but don't want to spend too much money, this is a great starter game. It does lack a few features of newer strategy games, but the improvements made from the original version make it almost as good as Starcraft (another excellent game all genre newbies should consider getting). The graphics are dated, but considering that the original game came out in 1995, they are impressive. This was not the Game of the Year of 1995 for no reason. Even if you already have Warcraft 2, consider buying this for Battle.net alone. At 8.99, it's definitely worth the multiplayer social and gaming experience. Everyone should own this game."
4,"Cool, old school Strategy","I have a lot of old strategy games, such as starcraft, total annihalation, aoe 2, and I have frequently played AOE 1. I have to say that, this game might seem a little cartoony, or really cartoony at first, but later, you will figure out that it's a really great strategy game. Drawbacks are that, 1. it may seem cartoony. 2. there are only two diferent races. and 3. it may seem to have horrible graphics, because it is an old game.All in all it is a great, old strategy game, thus recieveing four stars."
1,Don't waste your money,This DVD was very disappointing. All you see is Paige flitting around with her friends. Her demonstration of dance steps is horrible. She only gives instructions once and you put it together immediately making it nearly impossible to catch on unless you are a professional hip hop dancer and already know most of these moves. I would never buy another of her DVD's.
3,Classic CRPG,"First of all, understand that these games were cutting edge for their time. They were a step up from the old black and white text-only games. From that perspective, these games were incredibly well done. If not for these games, there would have been no NeverWinter Nights, Baldur's Gate (1 or 2) or PlainScape or any other number of the CRPG's that are out now.If you want to take a step back into the past and enjoy some well-formed gaming, try these. NOte: I reccomend trying them on Win 98 or with an emulator on WinXP. Any of today's modern systems are so fast and advanced that the game(s) may not play properly or at all, unaided."
5,really unique great weight,"I got two of these for rehab after a broken arm - I love the grip aspect, really works your hand as well. And if you drop it, it doen't hurt the floor!"
3,Decent introductory text; but shoddy construction,"Well, if I still refer to this text after having taken Intro to Biostats almost 3 years ago, then this book can't be all that bad. For the money, however, the publisher could have at least made the book more durable. This book starts to fall apart after only about a month of use- I kid you not!"
3,"Read ""Design Patterns"" first.","The first few chapters are useless. The antipatterns are ok, but are somewhat too general, factored solutions are not described very well, and examples don't illustrate well. I recommend reading ""Design Patterns"". This book is optional reading."
1,Common Sense sold as wisdom,"This book was quite a disappointment, especially since I heard so much about it. As Shakespeare said ""There is nothing new under the sun"" and this book proves it. It's really just putting fancy or cute titles (corncob!) on quite obvious, well-known software development problems. I don't think I saw a new or original thought in it except for the title. Having said all that, it might be a useful introduction to classic, well-known s/w problems for someone new in the field."
1,wrong product,i wish it was the right product i had to return to Getty money back i was not satisfied with my product
5,Still in good shape after 4 washes,Well priced. Good sweat absorber for the morning runs. Washes it 4 times and the elasticity still good for the price
1,Too Small,"Hunh, the very first review I read on these said that she had a 7&1/2 hat size & wasn't too tight or too loose.My hat size runs from 7&1/2 to 7&3/4 depend on the style & brand of hat. Within a few seconds of wearing them I could feel the blood throbbing trying to circulate, and headache started immediately after. After about 4 days of hanging it on awooden chair and resting my arm in it strecthing it out for a hour or so a day, it finally doesn't seem quite so tight. Now six more to go. If you have a large head, be warned!"
2,Too Small,"These are high quality headbands, which appear to be well made from good material. Here is the issue; as everyone else wrote, they are toooooo small. I wore it today under my bike helmet and by the time I got home I had a headache. Other people wrote the same thing, but I ignored it and now I have 5 headbands I will probably never use. To be fair the are very inexpensive, but I would have paid another ten cents to make them a little bigger. I fear if I wash them they will get even smaller, but at least then I could use them as wristbands.If your hat size is over a 6 I would not recommend this item."
3,White GOGO sweatbands,Sweatbands work great; but they smell of machine oil. I washed them once and they still smell like machine oil.
3,TO THIN,THE PRODUCT WAS TO THIN FOR ME.WOULD OF BEEN BETTER IF IT HAD BEEN THICKER.COLOR WAS GOOD BAND WAS GOOD JUST TO THIN TO HOLD SWEAT.
2,Annoying,"This book, like so many, is among the annoying books that pretend to offer everything to a ""dummy""The first couple of chapters look innocent and make you think that you are going to get alot of knowledge out of this book, but as you get to the chapters that are most important, the simplicity and clearity of the text is thrown out the window. He starts using terminology without defining it, doesn't break things down, and is just plain confusing.The approach is this:A is for apple.B is for bat.E = m c Squared.The customer looks at the first few chapters and buys the book.[...]"
1,Dummier than other Dummies books,"I bought this book to help study for the Windows 2003 server exams. Unlike the other Techno-Geek Dummies books, this book does not contain ANY exam practice questions or a CD with a sample exam. This book is also not as humorus or entertaining to read as other Dummies books. The first 9 chapters are a basic review of simple networking, like cables and how to install a NIC. You probably won't see much from the first 9 chapters on the Windows 2003 Server exam. Chapter 11 starts getting more technical and explains Active Directory fairly well, but this chapter also says that many topics are ""beyond the scope of this book"". This book is geared more towards a novice who has never setup a server before. I still think it's better than most of Microsoft's MOC books though. At least this book has real world examples and cuts through Microsoft's hype. If you are looking for an all in one study guide to pass the server exam though, keep looking."
1,Useless Book,I wish they has 0 stars as a choice to rate this book. This book is for someone who has very little experience or who has never installed a server. I usually like the dummies books as they are easier to read and understand but this one was a DUD!!!
3,Operational excellence,Interesting book and although factual description of Pullman travel. The Pullman car would not have been sucessful with out the Pullman porter.This book seems to imply that service in the cars was provided by the entire train crew while in fact the train was sucessful only because of the porters. A blunder on the part of the author.
4,loud but verssatile,"As mentioned, this stove is loud, extremely loud, at any setting. It has a very wide range - you can simmer without scorching thick stews or boil 4L of water in no time flat. Be aware however, that it can melt a hole in the wind screen or heat defuser just as easily. Or scorch the bottom of your pots about as fast - I've two to clean up at the moment.Find the absolute lowest simmer setting right out of the box - you'll want to use it most of the time. When it's time to boil water crank it up loud.It's a fuel miser compared to the WhisperLite.The flexible hose is still short, stiff and stupid like other MSR stoves.Stuff sack is too small for what we travel with."
5,Amazing Stove!,"As a backpacker, my emphasis is on saving weight. However, this stove is one of the areas where I splurge. It is slightly heavier than a simple ultra light stove, but the weight is definitely worth it. Amazing simmer control, very sturdy pot arms (I can put cast iron frying pans on it no problem), and talk about POWER! It boils water in 3-4 minutes and is VERY fuel efficient. A 22oz MSR bottle of white gas will last me a week if I cook two twice a day. Some people say that noise is an issue, but you are only cooking for less than twenty minutes, so, who cares? The rest of the day is spent in quiet solitude in the mountains...Also comes with an excellent cleaning and maintenance kit."
5,We love The Backyardigans!,"My daughter absolutely loves all episodes of The Backyardigans. She is now 14 months old but has enjoyed this show now for about 6 months. It is the only cartoon that is not annoying. In fact, my husband and I are often singing the songs throughout the day with or without her. :) The Singing, Dancing, and colors really keep her interest for the duration of the show if you really need to get some chores done."
4,"The ""Czechs"" in the mail...","This film was my introduction to Eastern European cinema and I was quite pleasantly surprised. Closely Watched Trains is a terrific coming of age story with plenty of humor thrown in along the way. On a deeper level, it expresses the problems with the Soviet occupation of the Czech republic after WWII. Thank goodness the censors weren't paying attention, or else we might never have had the chance to see this wonderful film. The image quality is excellent on this DVD transfer - there is hardly any grain and the film is wonderfully shot. I found myself empathizing with Milos by the end of the movie, and you will too!"
4,Nice series with a fun title,"Well done. The main character's brother, who is a pain in the neck, gets a bit wiser in the following season, so he's not as annoying, so the series gets even better. Some really good actors in there, such as the ex-husband of the hospital administrator, a minor character, but boy he is very very good (bad guy). Thumbs up."
5,Healing from Family Rifts,A very helpful book to help heal from family conflicts. Offers insight and thought provoking ideas and actions.
4,Great Story,"Until about 1/3 of the way into this book, I wasn't sure I would like it. Della began as a rather weak woman who was looking for a man - any man. Fortunately, I stuck with the book and as the plot thickened, Della changed. She used her brain and, with hard work, achieved what most wouldn't be willing to work so hard to achieve. There were a couple of interesting plot twists, and one major twist that was predictable. I liked Della and how she learned to handle herself."
3,Fairly entertaining,"I think tha chance was missed for a real exciting page turned, by it was a fun little read. No surpises"
3,I was expecting more.,"I have attended two concerts from this tour and it is nice to have some of these live performances on DVD. But I was hoping for more behind the scenes, more of a documentary style video and in that sense - this just was not what it could have been. I am a long time and dedicated fan with high expectations that were not met. Their concerts are amazing, but this DVD is not."
4,Biography,This biography comes directly from the group themselves. It shares personal experiences as they began their journey to stardom. If you like this group and want to more insight this is the book to read.
3,Installation,"Disappointed in claims of manufacturer. I reside ina Florida condo with a brutal morning sun problem.I recently installed approx 4 rolls of Energy Film,46X84"" in an effort to reduce the incoming solar heat.Product states a 70% reduction? My experience indicates maybe a 30% reduction, far below the advertised numbers. Although I had never installedwindow film before, I do read fairly well. I was somewhat confused by the instructions for the installation.The instructions did not specifically state to removethe plastic backing along with the white paper protecting the film. There was a note to place thisside towards the room (plastic side). I only learned by calling the company that the protective backing should have been removed and discarded. The info received was also confusing; one rep stated to remove the plastic, another said it didn't matter? Still not sure of the correct procedure? It should thoroughly/correctly be addressed in the accompanying installation instructions."
4,Excellent Housewarming Gift!,"I bought this for my girlfriend when she moved into a new apartment. Needless to say, she loves the Cork Pop. She's opened about 5 bottles so far and the tool has worked flawlessly.I gave it 4 stars instead of 5, as the box says it shouldn't be used on 1.5L bottles and nowhere in the product description did it say that. Hey, don't judge us because we like to drink cheap wine in large volumes!"
5,Convenient; Novel!,"Put this in my husband's Christmas stocking. He pulled the Cork Pops Original Wine Bottle Opener from the stocking first. He was so interested in this novel opener, we bagan to think he'd forgotten about the remaining contents of his well-packed stocking!"
5,cleans nicely,Really firm bristles clean stuff off of dishes very well. When it is dirty I pop it into the dishwasher and it comes out like new. I will order another one when this one eventually dies
5,May be mental but it works,I found this product in a shoe review on Amazon. I have achiles pain after long runs and hill work. This seems to be of great help. I have also used it on knees and I have reordered because my wife has started using it for her back pain.
5,Instant pain relief,"I first read about Toprol in Women's World magazine. I have suffered from Fibromyalgia and degenerative disk for 15 years. I had to stop working due to the pain. I ordered this miracle cream, and now I have much more mobility. I just have my husband rub the cream into my back, and in just a few minutes, I can actually do some housework or run errands.ThanksLinda"
5,It Works!,"I have carpal tunnel syndrome and was tired of all the heavily mentholated smelling creams and ointments that made wearing perfume or cologne impossible. There is nothing like having the two scents clash and then, well you can just imagine. Topricin works very well and does not smell. It has a cummulative effect. If you follow the instructions, you will get relief."
1,Didn't work for me.,"I can't speak for everyone, but I didn't find Topricin to work for treating my carpal. It's possible I'm the oddball out, but, I didn't find it that efficacious. I had better luck doing stretches and using an iced wrist pack. Disappointing."
5,Topricin,Product arrived ahead of scheduled delivery date and with minimal packaging. Product in excellent condition.
5,Great product.,Cream was given as a sample from the Chiropractor and it work great on my sons neck after hockey. I purchased some on line to save cash and received it quick and at a better price than at the Drs. office. Happy with the product and the great service.
4,Topricin Effectiveness,Product works as stated on package. Fairly effective in treating the tendentitis in my shoulder. Would recommend for similar problems.
4,good follow up...,"In this his second solo work, Motion keeps up his love for his Mexican homies by naming his cd Pablito's Way for starters and adding that it's musica picante, meaning hot sh__! I love the whoolio iglesias skit...that ""come caca"" always makes me laugh.This cd has some strong beats througout, and of course motion man's versitility on the mic. Nice guests, of course, my favorite: kool keith.Hope you have another release soon. If you like this you have to purchase motion man's first offering, as well as the collaborative effort called masters of illusion, and while you're at it: kool keith's ""sex style!"""
1,junk junk junk,"i loved it so much until i realized that it didn't work.i bought four lomolitos, too, and they all had non-working flashes.as in fourty dollars worth of disposable cameras that didn't work their lomo magic. waste of money."
4,awesome toy camera,"this is a toy camera, but it is very fun to fool around with.eight lenses produce eight images on the same 35mm negative, effectively showing the (very short) lapse in time while taking a photograph.play around with it. shoot from the hip. move the camera around. don't even look through the viewfinder.just have fun with it."
4,love it,i love my lomography camera.its really fun and easy to usebut it does take a few rolls toget the hang of it.not a good indoor camera andeven outside you have to be indirect sunlight otherwise the photowill be foggy.
4,Sticky Fingas,"I bought this album on a wim...and am stoked....great change of pace, and stellar sound"
3,Not the Best.,"THe Romances of Chretien de Troyes are mostly poems about Camalot and the knights who lived there. Chretien was a French poet whowrote in old French and was one of the earliest writers about these knights. This translation is OK, but I recommend the translatios of these poems by Burton Raffel and publishrd by Yale. They cost more, but are worth much more."
1,This is crap,"This thing is crap. The ""large"" ear piece was rather small and broke within a week. Nokia *promised* me twice they would send me a replacement ear clip but never did. Eventually it became an expensive (but light) paperweight. I'm sure there are tons better on the market. Don't waste your money."
2,Disappointed.,"The content of the book is great. However, the book lisited as new was purchased to be a present. It was obviously used."
3,MONCHICHIS!!!! Love it,"I bought this and wished there was more ""MONCHICHIS"" on the dvd, I do hope they release the complete series on dvd.I was not a fan at all of ""thundarr"",""dragons lair"" and ""galtar"" I found those cartoons boring and probably met for older people, thundarr a bit overrated.Although, ""Flinstones kids"",""Mr.T"",""chuck Norris"" and ""Monchichis"", i did enjoy and remember those cartoons..more MONCHICHIS please!"
5,Great sharing game,"If you have a child that is not into sharing this game is GREAT. In a fun and enjoyable environment it teaches that it's not only good to share but fun too. You pick a card and from the pile of food items they have to recognize and obtain the item on the card. Now, here is the sharing part, if someone already has the item they have to give it up. Items usually change hands several times. We had cousins that we really had problems with when it came to sharing toys. So, we took this game one step further and timed the games to see how fast we could go through the cards. It left little time to think about what had to be given up and always seemed to end in laughing and more sharing than the game called for. I love the real solid wood pieces. I will keep this game forever. Will be a great game for grandchildren...."
1,No real life examples,"This book sucks! Its just a little better than the help file included in with Excel. All he does is put it in a diffrent order. I was expecting small excercises where I could put my new skills all together, but there is none. So you read the whole book, remember as much as you can, and go off and try to mix and match hundreds of commands... buy another one."
1,Dead on Arrival,"I ordered this particular cable because I had heard that SIIG was a reputable cable manufacturer. Unfortunately, when I attempted to connect my Asus P5B Deluxe motherboard to my new Fantom GreenDrive 1TB, I couldn't communicate with the device. A Dynex cable from Best Buy (mid-range build quality at a very high price point) that I purchased to troubleshoot was able to connect the same two devices without any issues."
3,A Lesser (but Worthwhile) John Ford Effort,"Not one of John Ford's stronger films, but still well worth seeing. This is the first film Ford & Woody Strode worked together. They then became fast friends til Ford's death, & Ford used him in his subsequent films. (Woody played a VERY unique Mongol barbarian in Ford's last film ""Seven Women"".) The film studio allegedly didn't want Ford to use Strode in ""SR"", instead pressing for Harry Belafonte or Sidney Poitier, but Ford said the latter two actors ""weren't tough enough"". Here in his first Ford film, Strode is a bit stiff & wooden, but he's absolutely an iconic physical presence & lends great dignity to the role. The movie's racial politics are today somewhat dated, but for its time it was pretty daring & it completely is on the side of the angels. The final ""shocking"" revelation about a young woman's rape plays like a VERY bad ""Perry Mason"" climax, but that aside, this is a solid (good, but not great)film."
1,Hitting a woman is NEVER okay!,"What appalled me more than Lucien's backhand was Beth's reaction to it. Instead of hitting him back (my preferred reaction) or taking him to task, she forgives him and shoulders most of the blame. The whole interaction disgusted me. I don't mind that the man had a temper. In fact, I think an angry man can be a sexy man. But he should have hit the wall or thrown a priceless vase. He shouldn't have hit a defenseless, innocent woman.Lucien is NOT a hero, a man, or anyone I could admire or root for. He is a spineless coward who uses his fists against people who are no match for him physically. And then to say he did it because he loves her so much - UGH! He's a wife beater and I wish instead of forgiving him, Beth would have kneed him in the balls.I'm not sure I can ever read another Jo Beverly. This was my first and it really turned me off."
2,Boring,"This was my first Jo Beverley book and quite sure it's gonna be the last. After a promising start that had me very intrigued, the book went incredibly slow and bored me to tears with bits that were as useful as water is to wine. It took ages for something to happen between Lucien and Beth. Okay, I generally don't like sex too early in a book but in this story things are postponed way too much and eventually (my) anticipation turned into a solid ""who cares?"". Besides, I never managed to like the heroine: for this that she is described as a bluestocking I found her rather dull and not very intelligent at all.There were other details that annoyed me, such as Lucien being the result of an affair his mother had had when the Duke was away hunting. Pity! I really liked the Duke and I wished he hadn't loved his wife that dearly. She simply was undeserving of his devotion, IMHO. I so believe that both the hero and his ""father"" deserved better heroines."
1,Boaring!,"I didn't enjoy this book because it was a very dull and typical regency romance. Yes, the domestic violence didn't help either, especially since I am no stranger to this issue (which, some don't seem to realize, is still all too relevant), but it's certainly not the only reason not to like it."
3,Average Quality,"Expect the bench to arrive damaged. I ordered a replacement bench, but it arrived with missing hardware. Customer service sent wrong replacement hardware. Ended up going to local hardware store for parts."
4,Mugs are slighlty different from plates,"After a long search, I decided on this pattern. I ordered 2 sets and promptly received them yesterday. With all the promotions, I paid only $50 per set and $5 shipping per set. GREAT PRICE! I like them. As previous reviewers have mentioned, The colors are a little different from the picture shown on Amazon. It is more yellowish and less deep red. However, all the 3 types of plates still look very good. It is the mug that has a different tone of yellow. The reason is that the plates are made is USA and are the 'corelle material'. The mugs are made in China of ceramic material. Their color is the color shown in the picture. I gave only 4 stars because I wish the mugs were made of the same material and color as the plates.All in all still a very good set, great quality, at a great price."
5,GREAT everyday dishes,"I found these dishes on Corelle.com and immediately went looking to buy them. They match my kitchen and dining room decor perfectly. My kids have a wonderful habit of chipping/breaking dishes, but haven't succeeded in putting a single chip in these in the 5 months we've owned them (although they've tried). These Corelle dishes are thicker and feel sturdier than the everyday Corelle dishes that I grew up with. I highly recommend them. And, by the way, the picture shows the true color of these dishes."
4,"Beautiful, great for family. Makes weird noise.","Love this pattern & colors. Love that it's Corolle and I don't have to worry about chipping. We had stoneware before this set and it chipped & broke & was too heavy for my 4 year old.The weird noise is most noticable on the salad plate. The yellow decoration is ""printed"" on top of the plate and when you scrape silverware across it, it kind of sounds like finger nails on a chalk board. My husband is more sensitive to the noise than I am. I'm willing to live with it because it's a nice pattern :)"
4,Fun puzzle book,"This fun book is divided into four sections: Elementary Level, Challenging Level, Master Level, and Comprehensive Supertests. As you might guess from those section titles some of the tests are much easier than others and within the tests some types of questions are much easier than others. Each test series contains a wide cross-section of different types of puzzles so you are tested thoroughly. For example, there are diagrammatic puzzles, probability questions, crosswords, cryptograms, anagrams and other questions that really don't fit neatly into any of these categories. Self-scoring answer sheets complete the book and let you know approximately where you fall. I found that it was not uncommon to vary by as much as ten points around a median.Fun to do and interesting, The Big Book of IQ Tests is recommended to anyone who enjoys solving puzzles."
1,Terrible purchase,"It seems like a lie but until now Creative doesn't have created any equipment support for this model. In Windows 2k as in 98 when I open the tray....it opens but in a few seconds it closesalone.....incredible. Absurditly it does not even have a pattern of time to close, so you need to pray for, when you put or take the cd.When I bought it; I put 100 dlls to the trash can."
3,Not for a beginner,"This book does a good job of covering the topics that the author chooses, but this is by no means an all-encompassing text on object oriented methodology. There are some holes in the subject matter...like operator overloading. If you already understand C++, this book will make you a better programmer, but go elsewhere for an introduction to C++."
4,Nice Holster for My Ruger SR9c,"My SR9c fits nicely in this holster and I really like the retention feature. With a sturdy belt, it keeps the pistol snug against my body for decent concealment. However, after buying this, I kind of wished that I had considered an inside the waistband holster. I think there are several good options out there that cost less and offer better concealment. But, if you are looking for a sturdy, leather retention holster and aren't overly concerned with price or concealment, then I don't think you can beat this one for durability, fit and safety."
1,Unsatisfying ending,"This story about a burglar named Quinn and his romantic interest named Morgan fishtails at the end. During the whole intrigue, the reader is made to believe that Nightshade may turn out to be a womanNightshade turns out to not be a woman, but another mysterious woman turns up at the end without ever having been introduced, and Quinn ends up pursuing her with the result that the reader remains clueless as to what her role was in the story to begin with. Lousy ending. Not worth the money."
1,Pretty bad suspense - 2nd rate romance,Our heroine cannot make up her mind whether she loves quinn or hates him. In the mean time the non-suspense dribbles out a bit at a time. Worst read I have had in a long time - I expected a mystery/suspense novel - instead I got a romance novel (and a pretty bad one at that) Don't bother!
2,ok but not great,I bought this for my 8 year daughter. She loves garfield. She did not like this game. My husband played it and said he could see how it could be to hard for her. Maybe when she is older.
4,Nice,I like these a lot. Order up one or two sizes. I prefer the ones with cap sleeves but I ordered a couple of these bc the colors were not available with cap sleeves.
4,opened America's eyes to ska,"This album pales when it is compared to Operation Ivy, but is beats the hell out of any other lousy ""punk-revival"" bands like Green Day. The riffs are good but not always great; the ska theme doesn't always work & it's a bit too blatant; and Lars' voice is way better than Tim's & it still is. That said, this record at its' best is anthemic and catchy as hell (""Roots Radicals,"" ""Listed MIA""); with a few tracks dropped, it would be perfect. I wonder what Jesse Michaels thinks of it?"
5,Punk or not?,"Forget if they are true punks or not?If they are trying to be the Clash or not?I bought this album having seen some of their videos on TV.This is a great CD, much better than I had expected.There is not a bad song on the whole Album.So they were influenced by The Clash is that a bad thing?No way.What do you want? Influenced by Michael Bolton.Go buy it NOW!"
3,...And out come the Posers.,"This is by far my least favorite Rancid album. It has some really good songs but a whole lot of bad ones that belong on pop radio. I'm sure many 12 year old punkers and posers loved this one. However, Rancid still remains a great band. They are true to music and are of great influence to many. Without Tim, there would be no Hellcat. Without Hellcat, there'd be no Distillers or Horrorpops in our Cd players or on the radio. If you are just getting into Rancid, this is a great album, Enjoy. But when your ready, try 'Let's Go'. Now that's a great Rancid album."
2,This is a public service announcement....,"... with guitars! Or not, as the case may be. I know it's been said many times before, but it bears repeating: those who were around when the blueprint was established by The Clash have heard this before, only done so much better by Strummer, Jones & co.The Clash had legendary NYC poet Allen Ginsberg guest on a song (1982's ""Ghetto Defendant"") performing spoken word? No problem: Rancid will get legendary NYC poet Jim Carroll to guest on a song performing spoken word. Etc.The only surprise is that Rancid didn't call their next album ""Zapatista!"" and make a triple CD out of it.Seriously, go and buy ""The Clash"", ""Give 'em Enough Rope"", ""London Calling"", ""Black Market Clash"", ""Sandinista!"" and ""Combat Rock"" instead."
5,!!BEST ALBUM EVER MADE,"!!this is the best album ever created.every song is better than every song on any other albumi am not usually sad enough to waste my time writing reviewsfor amazon but this is truly the greatest and best album evermade ever in the whole universe ever.get all the other rancid stuff too and operation ivy, nofx, anti-flag, bad religion, etc. etc.p.s this is the best album in the world."
5,A must - have for any music fan,"With Bad Religion,you can never go wrong.Songwriters duo Greg Graffin and Brett Gruewitz easily match the absolute Lennon&McCartney; of punk:Joey and DeeDee Ramone.Greg G and Mr.Brett lyrics actually mean something,and they're not classicpunk lyrics at all.Unlike Dead Kennedys' Jello Biafra,Greg G andMr.Brett's social commentary always has an universal meaning andmessage,and it will never be dated,because it speaks of entirehumanity's life,fate,etc.About the album:a compilation from BR's Epitaph albums(the debut,Suffer,No Control,Against the Grain,Generator)-this is definitelythe album to start with.There is not one bad song on it,seriously!But let me point to the best:I Want to Conquer the World,Modern Man,The Answer,Against the Grain,Generator,oh,darn,they are all the best!!!"
2,"Brother, can you spare a dime?","I never could get this game chugging on more than one cylinder. The manual is irrevelant and no outside game helps are published (I've looked for more than a year). Play the stockmarket ??? Forget about it ... If you are not into the esoterica of steam trains or stupid country music, the computer steals the fun and always has you dead to rights. Historical trade and industrial patterns are treated very lightly indeed. I like to able to play the game, but I couldn't make it do anything."
1,Blecccch,"I wasn't expecting alot from this DVD, and I received even less. I now own a $20 dollar drink coaster...not even good as a novelty. Save your money."
2,Not much romance,"I was dissapointed in this book, since i was expecting to read another great romance novel from Janet Dailey. This novel was entertaining and a good read, however, there was hardly any romance going on between Hannah and Cutter or anyone else for that matter."
3,Ok But Not Great,"I had a pair of Panasonic RP-HT21s and they had great sound quality, about 60% of my Sennheiser HD 280 Pro sound quality, so I thought these would be the same as the only change seems to be the headband.After a cable shorted out I started looking for headphones like the RP-HT21s but with a behind the head band. I use these headphones when I,m working and I have to look down a lot. The over the top of the head type band always fell forward even when I made them as tight as I could so a behind the head type band was the logical step to correct that fault.The RP-HG10 falls short in that even though it has the ""XBS"" extra bass system that the RP-HT21s do they do not have the same level of bass. The RP-HG10 bass is almost not there even when I turn the bass all the way up. The RP-HT21 had no such problem.Even though the RP-HG10 fall flat when it comes to bass the rest of the audio spectrum seems slightly above average."
2,Not my taste,"About a year ago I read my first Robert Rankin book 'The Witches of Chiswick' after seeing it in the library and just being attracted to the title. I absolutely loved it. I never laughed aloud so much from reading a book. I was surprised because I am not usually into this genre. My husband read it after me and fell in love too. I then decided that I wanted to read every single book by R. Rankin.I bought 'Anti-Pope' and neither me or my husband liked it. He gave up 1/4 through and I had to force myself to finish it.I'm not saying it is bad... it is just not my type of thing. The story was pointless to me and not exciting at all. The writing and posh language of the characters was too surreal and the wit, puns, and silly footnotes from the author that I found in 'Witches of Chiswick' were missing completely.I'm not giving up on R. Rankin all together, but I wouldn't recommend 'The Anti-Pope' at all."
2,Received plant broken,Love the picture of this plant but received in poor condition. The stem was broken and the flower was dead. Still trying to nurse it to life with very little success.
2,Where do we go from here?,"1) Don't buy this game. 2) If you buy this game, be prepared to think you are about to have a blast only to learn that there is no way around a dead end."
3,Starts fun but.....,This looked and started as great fun; however I can't even get through the tutorial without going bankrupt or in cement shoes. Just not enough instruction; it gets so frustrating I'm going to give in and get the book. Wonder if they made it that way?
1,Not the book,"This is not the book seen in seinfeld it has no legs on it or coasters and they advertise it as ""Kramer's coffee table book"" and it is not.I have yet to find a replica identical to the book in the seinfeld sitcom."
1,Target: Whoever watered down this overpriced ruination...,"The original miniseries was a riveting and startling film about political ambition gone frighteningly wrong. It even spun off a wonderful but short-lived series (""Mancuso""). The condensation of the movie down to less that two hours destroys any suspense built up during the original's lengthy running time, and if you view the online ""preview"" of the movie, several important plot points and the very tricky surprise ending are revealed. I'm going to wait patiently for the day the full movie is on DVD."
1,farcry,"I got the game fro Amazon, I have a Win 7 , 64bt software.The game I got was for 32bt, so it will not install on the PC,So now I will have to send it back I guess.Where can I get the game in a 54bt?"
5,Very Happy with the Game,I only paid about $7 for this game and I loved it. Played it on my laptop. Easy to install. Comes with 5 Discs. Great art work and plenty of weapon choices as you progress through the game. I loved using the shoulder mount rocket launcher. I didn't like the way it ended but I still loved playing it. The girl in the game is kind of dorky and she gets in the way a lot. Heh Heh Heh
1,Not all that,For the money this is not a very good product. It takes as much elbow grease to clean with as without it. I find it gives off way too much water so that you are having to use a lot of drop clothes to keep other items from getting soaked. For windows it was a flop even with the soap and for tile in the bathroom well it just isn't a very good product for heavy cleaning. Perhaps once the heavy cleaning is done it would be ok for keep up but as far as I'm concerned it was a waste of money.
4,Euro-Pro Shark Professional Electronic,I think this product is great... It's great for cleaning in the cracks around the kitchen and bathroom
3,Too small,The flickering light is very realistic- looks just like a candle. And they do last the amount of time they say they will. They are also very easy to charge. I was just disappointed in the size. Thought they were very small for the price you pay for them. I thought they would be more the size of a soda can- more the size of a good pillar candle but were small and skinny instead.
5,Approved by my six ferrets,"I use yogies as a training aid, to learn the litter box, to learn to come when called, and using yogies has worked, they LOVE them."
5,A Victory for Heart and Mind!,"Judy Peterson's book ""Follow your Heart"" is intelligent and inspirational at the same time. I have recommended it to some of my clients that are searching to find their dreams. They have all liked it a lot. They have also commented on the wonderful style and tone of voice the book is written in."
5,Unexpectedly Fantastic,"This gem fell into my hands in early 2010 and I was floored by it. I've been a fan of The Church since the Seance album and I've seen them live (in their various incarnations) close to twenty times. IMHO, Uninvited Like the Clouds is a startling achievement for a band which has produced many, MANY albums containing two great songs, five mediocre songs and three or so wankers. This album breaks that mold with a velvet hammer. There are few (if any) songs herein which are soundly mediocre, zero wankers and possibly five which fall into the great category for me.If you like The Church, you should get this record. If you've stuck with them through the years and saw the promise of the album After Everything Now This you MUST buy this album. The Church built on the renewed momentum from that album and hit one out of the proverbial park with Uninvited Like The Clouds."
4,Roadpro Briefcase,"Nice solid construction. The price is very nice. Looks to be made well. The pen holders are all I have a gripe about. I like using big, fat, fountain pens. They don't fit well in the three pen holders.I'll probably buy another one once this one reaches it demise, or I mite pick one up for a friend."
1,WORST!!!!,"The worst thing!!! I really Hate it,I really Hate itI really Hate itVery bad product, I've never seen this before!"
1,BEWARE,The worst brief case ever. Looks great but doesn't hold up. The latches break easily with normal wear. My first one lasted two months. I was unable to return but did order a second one. My second lasted a month. Latches broke again. Time to order a better quality item.
4,Engaging for the right reasons,This book despite the scripts is worth the read. It taught me about how to command patients in trauma or medical situations. It taught me how to communicate while critically thinking. It is just a generally agreeable book that gave me some really good ideas about how to get patients to co-operate when nurses just give in to the monotony of the routine.
3,Good basics - not in much depth,"The idea of ""verbal first aid"" fascinates me. How much can we do with words alone in a crisis? Judith Acosta's book says we can do quite a lot -calm people down, make them feel safe, even promote healing.Most of her techniques are drawn from guided imagery and hypnosis - stuff I was already very familiar with. I describe some of this experience in my book ""The Art of Getting Well: Maximizing Health when You Have a Chronic Illness"" (available on Amazon). But if you don't know much about imagery, some of this might be a revelation to you.I wish there had been more specific examples and ideas - a lot of it is too general for me. It was a worthwhile read, but I didn't learn as much as I had hoped."
5,Love Coben,"You can never go wrong with Harlan Coben and if you've never read any of the Myron Bolitar series, you are doing yourself a disservice. Love, love, love this character. So real!"
4,one false move kindle version,a great story by coben. only issue is the kindle version is loaded with typos. wow I counted over 50 word spelled wrong
2,Paraphrase,"If you buy this, you must remember that this is a paraphrase, not a literal translation. It is very readable, but there are inaccuracies in it. For example, in Judges 16, it says that Samson prays to pay back the Philistines ""for the loss of at least one of my eyes."" In the New American Standard Bible, a translation, it says ""that I may be avenged of the Philistines for my two eyes."" I bought The Living Bible to read alongside the NASB to see if it would give me any insights--I have been disappointed instead at the little inaccuracies, like the one above, that I have found. I could not trust what is written here to be accurate. Oh well! Back to the NASB or the English Standard Version, both excellent translations!"
4,It's All New Too Me.,"This is my first experience with a computer and all its companions. I really love this printer although I still haven't figured out how to print envelops. Colors are bright and very clear, my friends who know printers are impressed so I was lucky in this purchase as I did it blind."
5,It's a book that makes me laugh out loud.,"""Bellingham by the Bay"" is relaxing reading -- and entertaining. It's something I keep by the bed. I'm a retired English Lit teacher and when the world grows too serious, I keep returning to ""Bellingham"" for its good writing and witty, irreverent insights. At my age, laughter is a great elixir. Try it!"
5,"Fun, Fast book",I have never thought I would like a romance novel. I stumbled upon this and needed something to read I absolutely loved this. It will not make you think to hard and Emma and Alex are fun characters. I have tried reading Minx the third in this set cause I had my hands on it and skipped over the beginning of it and went to the end. I look forward to reading Belle's love story but so far of the trilogy this is my favorite and I will try and find more of her books.
2,Refuesed to Give Up,I read about a book a week. I have a rule when I start a book I will finish it. No exceptions! I had a hard time continuing this book.It was too predictable. I did read it until the end- so I guess that's one accomplishment?
2,If you like wasting money on worthless books - Get this one,"If you just like buying books for the heck of it, then reconsider buying this one. This book doesn't seem to cover the topics that would be very useful. Some topics which required further detail were not mentioned whereas those which did not need attention were given MORE than what they deserved.I had this book for a few years now and I still kick myself for buying it when I did because it's just plain BLAH. It's not interesting reading material. For once, the Unleashed books by Sam disappointed me.Don't take this as a bad sign. There's a LOT of SAM Publishing books which are great, just not this one.By the way, look at when this book was published and how many reviews there have been thus far. It'll give you an idea whether to get the book or not."
2,Much Smaller Than Advertised,"This costume is made from very thin material. This isn't surprising; most store-bought costumes are. But I have purchased several costumes off of Amazon, and this one was the only one I would rate as poor quality.It was also much smaller than advertised. It said it fit 190-210 lbs. My husband is 190 and it was quite small.I would suggest you get the robe instead...if that is good :)"
5,Great Strings,"The DR Hi-Beam 10-52's work great for my style. They have a lot of energy, they sound balanced across the set, and they keep their full tonal range longer than most other strings. I don't think I've ever broken one, and I tend to play a little hard at some points when I'm into a song.I use DR Strings on my electrics as well (10-46 nickel wrap,) and will not use another brand of string unless it's an emergency."
4,Simply great,"I LOVE these sandals. They are very simple but sooo comfortable and cute at the same time. They are easily worn with dresses, jeans, shorts, casual, dressy.. you name it. Very versatile. They are true to size."
2,More info for the prospective purchaser...,"This book contains work by many comics creators, both American and abroad. Be aware that it's only 48 pages in hardcover! It was originally published by Editions Carabas in Europe, but this particular version was released in the US by Dark Horse Comics (its first English translation). This is a collection of pin-ups and short stories all focusing on vampires. The stories are very much like what you'd find in Heavy Metal: great artwork, with plots ranging from decent to confusing. The lineup includes Bryan Talbot, Philippe Caza, Benot Springer, David Lloyd, Mike Mignola (pin-up), Tommy Lee Edwards, Richard Marazano, Gary Gianni (pin-up), Yoann and Sfar (hilarious Batman parody), and others. The book is topped off by a great cover by Matthieu Lauffray. Basically, the book looks great but is lacking in coherent storylines and content. Still, if you're a comic art afficionado, this is a good deal."
1,"DON'T TOUCH!!! THEY'RE MINE, HOSER!!!",DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT BUYING ANY NOFX CD!!!! THEY'RE ALL MINE!!!! (just kidding. they are the greatest. I'll allow you to get it if you can handle it).
4,good cd from an awesome band. buy it!,"Ok, we all know that NOFX is the best punk band ever, but some people need some evidence. THIS IS THE EVIDENCE. You can't go wrong with songs like Bleeding Heart Disease, Philthy Phil Philanthropist, and Freedom like a Shopping Cart. The CD is packed with humorous, serious, and grinding songs. You have to admire the lyrical quality of songs like Hotdog in a Hallway, and Hobophobic. In short... BUY THIS CD! p.s. an even better bet would be punk in drublic, also by NOFX"
2,Not a CPU,"Well, first off this isn't a CPU. It is a PC. Big difference.In my modest opinion, if the people selling computer accessories can't determine the basic parts of a computer from the actual computer itself, they don't deserve a good rating."
2,Exhausting,"I was roped in by the very excellent writing, but the book was way too long. I spent hours wading through it because it was indeed suspenseful. When finally the case was solved, I felt totally ripped off and ashamed that I had allowed myself to waste that many hours of my life. While the many detailed descriptions of London were superb, there were way too many of them. I found the author's vocabulary awesome but exhausting."
2,Agatha is better!,"After having read 30 pages of ""Original Sin"" I felt a strong desire to stop. I had read ""Death in Holy Orders"" before (from beginning to end). However, the derogatory remarks made by the author about my favourite queen of crime, Agatha Christie, caused me to be sceptical. There is a Latin saying: ""De mortuis nihil nisi bene"". Mrs James ought to go by that saying.While ""Holy orders"" are more or less OK (during the lecture, negative experiences tend to be just barely compensated by positive ones), ""Original Sin"" is definitely below the limit.So, conclusion: Agatha is (much) better!"
2,What a Waste of $10,"I purchased this book because it was required for a college communication course and about 70% of the material it covers is common knowledge. I'm sorry but, if you made it to college without knowing what ""branding"" is or ""why stereotyping is dangerous,"" then you should consider re-enrolling yourself in a better high school before you try to pursue a legitimate college education."
3,Offspring before they really set their own style,"Because this was the Offsprings first cd, and because it was made in '89 their are a lot weird things on the cd that are typical of the eighties :the cd cover, the songs about desert storm, the fact that there are more guitar solos(too bad that in modern punk they are seldom found), the style of singing and the songs in general. I now own all five offspring cds, ignition being my favorite, then Ixnay, smash, debut, americana. The offspring are one of my top 5 favorite bands, but their debut isn't half as good as ixnay or smash, and after owning i regret buying it more than americana, its decent. The best songs are ""Crossroads"", ""Tehran"", ""I'll be waiting"""
3,good but predictable,"the storyline of this book is really good, the book started off really well and kept me page turning but I got sooooooo bored when mr.Pike dedicated a whole chapter to scuba diving. although scuba diving is basically what it's all about, there were too many details. also the killer was obvious right after some chapters (to me anyway). I did suspect a better ending to this book. It was a nice story though, but probably one of the best books Pike has ever written is Whisper of death. This one gets to you like no other book does."
1,Battery cover fell off and I lost battery in the grill.,"I was initially satisfied with the operation of the thermometer, but when I first used it at the grill, the battery cover came off and I lost the battery into the gas grill. The battery cover was not made well and doesn't stay on. I got a new battery, but I must say that after taping the thing together, it just makes me mad to look at it... I would send it back to Taylor, but I lost the address."
1,DISAPPOINTED!,I got this for Christmas. It died today! Tried replacing the battery and it still didn't work. Not a good choice.
2,Good well it worked,"I purchased this thermoneter with the hope it would be a step-up from the basic model. The product never met that expectation. The ""professional"" did not read any faster and after a couple of months the display faded. I have tried serveral batteries without improvement. Stay away from this one."
1,"terrible, boring movie -- a rip off at any price","this is the third time I was suckered into PAYING for a movie on amazon that was complete crap. I want my money back.No-name actors, negligible production values, threadbare plot, all filmed with one camera in and near a deserted town somewhere in California or Arizona (supposedly Sicily). Some ridiculous errors, like one officer with captain's bars on his lapel but a lieutenant's bar on his hat. Very little dialog -- most of the movie was 2 small bands of German and us soldiers spraying machine gun fire at each other. Like the whole last half of the movie was just shooting. A real platoon would have run out of ammo in the first 10 minutes."
1,"Boring, repetitive and silly","Boring, repetitive and silly, 'Gun-Sword' is pretty much everything that is wrong with the 'Mecha' anime genre. Each episode of the first disc you could predict the ending...oh...from about the first 5 minutes in: Reluctant 'loner' has to rescue this person this ep, has to rescue another person(s) the next ep; all the while searching for his true 'enemy'. Some baddie would show up with a mech and the 'reluctant loner' (even though he doesn't want to) would eventually have to fight him (again, even thought it's really not his concern and he really doesn't want to fight). Ho-hum, been there, done that. Listening to the English dub, it also felt like the actors were just going through the motions on this one. Even the usually spectacular Michelle Ruff seemed a little off from her normal performance. Unless you really, really need a Mecha fix, avoid this one."
4,Great Family Movie,"I have read all the books in the Love Comes Softly Series. The DVD's stay true to the story line yet I didn't find the balance of humor, heartbreak or hardships to be very well balanced in the movie version. The books are so well written in the fact that author deals with everyday hardships yet manages to bring out the hope and love that enables each of us to endure hard times in our own lives. She also manages to bring the reality of Christ into the story in such a way that after reading her books, you feel the reality of love and compassion come to life in your own heart. Her books and now movies are a wonderful inspiration of the life one can live through the Love of our Lord Jesus Christ."
4,Movie falls short of book...,"This was a good movie, but is nothing like the book. I was a little disappointed. Willie was never a sheriff, and their daughter does not die. Both Marty and Clark come to visit Missy, not just Clark. Clark's accident in the mine is also not mentioned. In the book, Missy and Willieseem to make a good living, ranching. In the movie, Missy has to teach to make ends meet. Where did the evil Mayor of the town come from, and Missy and Willie's ""adopted"" son?"
2,Disappointed Customer,This movie is a real let down. I was very disappointed with this movie. It was not anything like the book. It would have been an excellent movie if he had based it off the book. It would have been one you would like to watch over and over again. I really enjoyed the first three movies in this series. This one is a real let down. How is he supposed to make any more movies since he left out some of the characters of the book such as Ellie and Luke? It was really disappointing. If you have read the book you may not like the movie. They are starting to use a little language that I do not approve of.
2,Janette Oake film series,"Purchased full set of the Loves Come Softly DVDs. I had purchased them for my daughter, she's a pastor's wife. She told me, before I shipped them to her that they did not follow the book series at all and to not send them. I shipped them back to Amazon."
1,HOLE IN BLANKET,THERE WAS A SMALL HOLE IN THE BLANKET AND WHENEVER I CLEAN IT THEIR ARE FEATHERS EVERYWHERE
4,Thought Provoking,"It takes a certain level of courage to attempt to write what a conversation between Christ and Hitler would look and sound. I think everyone has their own passionate views of such a dialog, therefore any attempt to create such a conversation could drive people away from viewing it.Yet, Michael Moriarty's attempt is a very good one. I had some disagreement with his vision but it was very thought provoking. There is no attempt to make easy explanations for difficult theological concepts or cheap justifications for the evil people do.The acting was fantastic. There is a point in the film where you feel that Christ and Hitler are actually conversing instead of two homeless men."
4,A soothing story with almost forgotten wisdom.,"Every picture in this book is a delight, speading across each pair of facing pages, and the story is written in a quiet, loving tone that instantly makes the reader at home. In this day of instant everything, I particularly appreciate the message that great things take time. Wise Grandmother uses the entirety of the 3 other seasons to prepare for her winter. I really enjoyed the comfortable and informative way the story invites the reader to experience how many living things react to winter. Birds fluff, worms tunnel, adults prepare and children wonder.I agree with all of the other reviews about this book, I just don't want potential buyers to feel that one has to subscribe to a purely nature based philospohy or belief system to enjoy this book. It is charming regardless of which (if any) winter holidays your family celebrates."
5,Holiday Hits (House Party Karaoke),"Love this CD+G. There are 25 tracks:1.) It's Beginning To Look A Lot Like Christmas,2.) We Wish You A Merry Christmas,3.) The Twelve Days of Christmas,4.)

Go Tell It On The Mountain (contemperary version)On screen lyrics, and...all songs are professional re-creations of the original recordings. Sounds great! :)"
2,Overrated,"I prefer Kimon Nicolaides' ""The Natural Way to Draw"" that was first published in 1941 -- the source of many of Betty Edwards' ideas presented in this recylced and overrated book. Kimon Nicolaides' book is far more structured, sustained and illuminating and would recommend it highly to the serious art student over this book by Edwards. Fortunately, Nicolaides' book has been republished and is also available through Amazon."
3,It ok,still in the process of reading...this is a hard to focus and read but I am determine to get through it.
5,can't say enough good things!,"i can't say enough good things about this book. the explanations make sense, the exercises progress logically, and each one pushes your limits a little bit more. my drawing skills have improved immensely, and i'm only 1/2 way through the book. the basis of good painting is having a good drawing and sense of the perspective in your subject. without the ability to ""see"" what you're looking at, paintings will come out less than stellar - this book will prepare you to be able to ""see"" the way an artist sees. buy it!"
4,Tricky,This stuff is a bit tricky to get to rise correctly... but it tastes as decent as any low-carb bread I've ever had. Perfect for a diabetic or low-carb dieter.
3,Better than average low carb taste,"When folks give this a 5 star, they MUST be basing it on the taste of low carb bread. As far as breads go (Fresh made Italian being the best), this does not compare. However, if you want an edible bread that is very filling, this will fit the bill. Don't confuse this with really good tasting bread, it isn't. But it serves its purpose!"
1,Tastes like cardboard. Don't waste your money,Please don't waste your money. This product has a horrible taste. We followed the directions and it came out of our bread machine looking mangled and twisted with a lumpy texture.
4,Good Substitue,"If you are on a low carb diet, this is the bread you want. It is a very good substitution for the junk in the grocery stores."
4,Erotic,"I purchased this after reading Wicked. So, I did it backwards! I loved it. Lost sleep because I had to find out what happens to Sinjin. It is truly a romance with amazing hot passion between the hero and his lady. I have a thing for men with long hair and I can totally imagine Sinjin when he strides into the room! I recommend this one hands down. Get ready to lose sleep and be amazed."
1,Sinjun St John? Ludicrous!,"I was contemplating buying this book, until I saw the hero's name. Sinjun St John??? Doesn't Johnson know that 'Sinjun' is merely a phonetic rendering of St John? In other words, the name 'St John' is *pronounced* Sinjun! And therefore, the likelihood that any English aristocrat would be called Sinjun St John is less than nil.*Please* do your homework in future, Johnson!"
3,A for Effort,"Phillip Caputo really knows the third world, and his vision is essentially Conradian. He's wise and smart, and has written a serious book about large questions of the kind almost never asked by contemporary fiction. It was a relief, for once, to read something that was more than glib, decorative, and smugly improbable, as so many current novels seem to be. That said, the only convincing character in this book is Wes Dare-- all of the others are simply unreal. The result, unfortunately, is a novel that doesn't do justice to its own ambitions."
4,Interesting fiction about Sudan,"I was a little reluctant to read this book because of its depressing focus on international aid in Sudan. While it certainly wasn't always uplifting, Caputo creates characters so well rounded and portrays Sudan so vividly that I started reading and found I couldn't stop. Some of the characters were frustrating and at some points I easily guessed the plot twists, but it was such an intriguing novel that I really enjoyed reading it."
5,Nice Kicks!,They have a suede material finish. Very detailed designs. An overall nice shoe. They don't scuff as easily as suede normally does either which is very nice for a guy who is clumsy and always hitting them on steps and such.
4,"Not the original hits, but well done nonetheless...","These are rerecordings of Janie's greatest hits. Ordinarily, I would roundly pan such a collection, but I have to say, Janie is in fine voice on the album and the musical interpretations are pretty close to the originals. I'm not sure when she recorded these new tracks, but she sounds every bit a strong and fresh as when she sang them originally. For diehard fans and completists, this is a nice collection. But if you're a casual fan looking for a nice overview of Janie's work, seek out the out-of-print Anthology on Renaissance Records, the out-of-print Celebration CD from 1987, or the still-in-print 17 Greatest Hits. These CDs contain the original recordings."
1,treats the subject frivolously,"I found several serious flaws with the text. It's too easy. There's too much filler. I learned almost nothing from it. To be sure, Strang has some interesting sections here, but he spends roughly half the book on talk, and the other half on linear algebra. Also, the text just seems like it's devoid of any serious material. It's too easy, and I was a complete beginner in linear algebra. Finally, it's completely useless as a reference because a lot of new ideas are presented in the exercises, where they are difficult to find when you are searching for some particular topic.I would recommend ""Linear Algebra"" by Friedberg, et.al.(isbn 0132338599) It costs the same, but I became quite an expert after reading it."
4,The right thing for engineers,"I agree. This is a great book to really learn linear algebra from. Especially for engineers, who are more interested in the ""essence"" of the subject, rather than the strict mathematical proofs and definitions.I have studied the book 4 years after studying linear algebra from a purely mathematical textbook, and I am not ashamed to say I realized my ignorance! Through this book I really learned what linear algebra really is about.I gained what you can call ""intuition"" in the matter, thus being able to predict the result of a problem without explicitely solving it."
2,Bad writing.,"Frankly speaking, Gilbert Strang's book is bad in writing. I think that the content is good but the way to write and explain is very hard to understand unless you have the concept of linear algebra already. All and all, good content but BAD writing."
1,Gardner Bender CR-100 4Inch Romex Cable Ripper,This item absolutely does not work. I have tried it on every type of wiring I have in the shop. It will not cut the romex cable at all.
3,Good for a start!,"Would like to have seen more done with live flowers. Liked Misty's techniques on coursages and bouquets, but would have liked to have seen table arrangements and florals for the Church."
2,Don't waste your Money!,"This book sucks big time! A cheap story plot, combined with events that just don't seem good enough to be put in a novel - puh lease! The only good thing about this book is all the morals it teaches. Even then, the book isn't all that hot."
5,The BEST BOOK to tell children about war guests,"I love this book.I didn't really like the book about wars before I read this book.I think almost every children will like it.Norah, ten-year-old girl who is two years younger than me, is brave unlike me.I liked the part when she met Bernard and Paige because she looked so pathetic.That part remind me when I first came to Canada.That's why I really like this book, I guess.I felt like reading a book that is 80% about me.well, I recomand this book to EVERYONE!!-I like all books of Kit Pearson's.To tell the truth, I have six books of her's in my house."
4,about writings and political struggle,"The book is a lengthy look at Tsarist Russia, giving views of what it was like to struggle against a reactionary regime, that strongly opposed any reforms. The time is the early 19th century. We see the intersection between a literary subculture and the imperial government.Unlike many books about famous authors, this only deals partially with its subject's writings. Much of the text is taken over with analysing the subject's dealings with his friends and with the changes happening in Russia. He joins the ""Secret Society"" and helps in their conspiracies. Much to no avail, as the Russian government was too entrenched."
4,Post Punk Tex Mex,"Fun stuff indeed. I don't know much about this band but I do like this disc because it is upbeat crazy non stop action and way off the dial. Their next album is much better however, Subliminal Kill is a better place to start, the lyrics are satyrical funny for either side of the border. Once you have that, then you must have this. They sing in Spanish and English and obviously influenced by Wire and the post punk genre. Very rare and very Original."
1,ITEM NOT DELIVERED,THIS PURCHASE WAS CHARGED TO MY CREDIT CARD ON DEC 21 BUT NEVER DELIVERED. I SENT YOU AN EMAIL ABOUT THIS MATTER.
1,far from convincing or realistic,"This book is another yet reformulation and compilation of various systems' knowledge geared to the current market and desires. A little analysis of the techniques depicted shows them to be as dangerous (to the executor, not the assailant) as the ""bad"" techniques or interpretationns he criticises. So it's dangerous for those who don't know anything about martial arts, and useless for those who do know something. While it's an ingenious and alluring idea/system he proposes, and although I'm sure Dillman himself is a dangerous man, this book looks like being part of a commercial enterprise rather than a useful technical manual."
1,very disappointing,"ok where to begin, I am so disapointed. These techniques are completely ridiculous. Buy this book if you want to get killed, or offer it as a gift to your worst enemy. but I guess u can beleave whatever you want, and a good thing is confidence so if you're confident these things will work it's better than nothing, then maybe you can inflict one of his kentuky fried chicken techniques that causes pain in the arm (SO WHAT) and hope your oponent is really drunk (but then maybe he wont feel pain, oh wait what's the point of doing that in the first place anyway) I'll try to put a REAL obvective critic on the book itself. it's a nice book, with a nice image on it, but the images inside are all black and white (probably, I went trought that real fast and I'm returning it right away) and there is lots of blank spaces, but that would'nt be too bad if the space that is used was used to show something usefull... DON'T BUY IT"
3,"Too soft, but with some good contents","The contents of the book is accurate as far as I can tell. I am also a follower of pressure point fighting, BUT I felt that this book contained a lot of practically irrelevant pressure points.The book can help you to advance your technique and to add some points into your list of targets, but you need to read selectively. Example: The upper lip ""is not a hit point. Rather it is a rub-point"". I would not bother to rub an upper lip if I can turn the nose into bloody mud. This book advocates a soft style of fighting, which depending on where you expect to fight, might not be the most effective way. The other issue is, that an attacker will hardly wait and pause to allow you to hit his pressure point accurately. Most of these points are farily small areas and difficult to hit.Therefore, I think the contents is accurate, but only a small portion might be useable."
5,Just what I was looking for,"As a yoga teacher, I was looking for a CD that I could play during relaxation at the end of class. This CD was perfect for quiet, peaceful meditation time. The steady tones coming from the bowls offers a gentle deepening into meditation."
5,Reality Is Much Stranger Than You Could Even Imagine!,"You may find this story hard to believe, but if you look at all of the things that are going on in our world today, it's easy to believe that this man's story could very well be true. I am convinced that there are only two true forces at work in the world, good & evil. Goodness is from our true creator and the author of evil is Satan. The Father, Son & Holy Spirit and God's angels are REAL just as Satan(Lucifer) and his fallen angels are REAL. I have always believed this to be the truth.I would suggest that before you read this book, that you view the video interview with Roger Morneau. It covers most everything that is in the book and will help you understand and possibly believe his story if you can see his testimony on video. The video interview is over 3 hours long, but well worth viewing, especially if you're searching for the truth. [...]"
3,A little disappointed.,I was a little disappointed when I watched this movie. I guess I was expecting to really enjoy and laugh when I watched it. I was bored after 1/2 hour of the movie. I would suggest purchasing or renting Shawn of the Dead instead.
3,dead and breakfast is goofy and good,"Oh people,people when can we stop comparing.Nothing will ever beat classic horror movies.This one is quite entertaining if you put aside comparison.Its funny to a degree and there are alot of humage to other films if you look closely.This one is far better than some of the ones that plaqued the screen earlier.Sure the acting is bad but then again watch The Bad Seed the acting was bad but its a classic.Dead and Breakfast is campy but enjoyable.It's a spoof on horror/slasher film and succeeds.The plot is simple; a group of friends on their way to a wedding get lost find a place to stay for the night stumble on a curse inside a box which was opened and now fighting for their life from dead folks.Its simple gory funny and campy.I agree with one of the other writers. I can watch this one over and over too,only because I stopped comparing and started enjoying! But hey its your time."
4,It's like a bad horror movie...only worse!,"Dead & Breakfast is an enjoyable popcorn flick. It is about a group of friends who visit a town that becomes infested with zombie-like creatures. It is almost like a parody of horror movies, because of its intended cheesiness. Nothing in this movie is to be taken seriously. We have a huge amount of people dying gruesome deaths all over the place, with country music playing in the background. Like one film critic said, it's ""The U.S. Answer to Shaun of the Dead"". If you like zombies, gore and dark comedy than this movie is for you!"
3,Pretty good movie,This is a decent movie. Some parts are better then others. This is one you might want to rent before buying.
2,Rather be fishing,"Take a nap before you watch it or else you'll fall asleep like me. I like a good goofball horror flick as much as the next guy, but this one is just a wannabe. It had potential with the comic book scene transfers and musical undertones - both elements which i liked and thought were quite creative - however, i just couldnt get past the horribly annoying and retarded characters, like the deputy - uggg! That first gore scene where dude's eating the pie in the kitchen did manage to squeeze a giggle or 2 out of me, though. So there are a few laughs and some decent effects, but for the most part the attempted slapstick is just too corny for my tastes. And not that it always matters in the horror genre, but the dialogue and script were just awful and contrived too. I give it a couple stars for the gore but I might suggest you rent this one before purchasing. Who knows, it might grow on me like Cabin Fever did. Word up"
2,Dead,Wasn't impressed with this one.Rehash of ideas from other films including Michael Jackson video Thriller.
2,Computer Journalism,"If you want to read about Turing and the origins of computing on the level and in the style of your Sunday newspaper, this is your book (especially if that Sunday newspaper of yours comes in tabloid format). Otherwise, go for something more intelligent, like A. Hodges, Davies or Copeland."
3,Questionable,"It was difficult and expensive to find all the necessary ingredients/juices/groceries, etc. needed to stick to the diet, and then time-consuming to prepare the meals, especially for someone who has limited time and experience. I may give it another try--when I have more time - and money!"
3,Eat your veggies........,"..exercise, avoid trans fats and processed foods. Not much here that we haven't already been told a thousand times. My biggest complaint about this book is that if you don't want to follow Dr. Galland's menus for each stage, you won't know what to add to the next stage without going through his meal plans and figuring out what is different. Lists of what to eat and what not to eat on each stage would have made the plan much easier to follow. There is a bit more information for the first stage including the helpful eating out ideas sheet, but otherwise I felt very lost.The best thing I can say about The Fat Resistance Diet is that the recipes are very, very good. Easy to prepare as well."
5,It works!,"As a decades long veteran of the diet wars I've tried just about everything that was out there to lose weight and improve my health. The problem with all the past diets was that I was always so damn hungry inbetween meals. I found this book while surfing around on the internet. I've been on the program now for 2 months, I have lost 12 pounds almost effortlessly. When I am hungry I am genuinely hungry, I feel satisfied with what I eat and those drive-me-mad cravings for sugar or over-processed foods have virtually disappeared. My energy is beginning to pick up and my blood pressure has come down. The recipes are fairly simple to follow as is the plan. You do have to do a little reading at the beginning to understand the process but it is worth it. It may not have a glamorous title or be a fancy fad, but this program does work. I was skeptical of yet another plan but I only have good things to say about the book and program. Give it a try."
5,Great for the Antarctica buff,"Got this book as a gift for my dad, since he has just about every other book about Antarctica. He was excited to have a new one, and had never seen this title before. He read it over the next week and gave rave reviews."
3,harmless fun,"this has some great anecdotal stories for those of us who grew up with the misery that accompanies being a cleveland sports fan but, by no means, is it good literature. it's entertaining, if not somewhat confounding because of the memories that it dredges up, if you want some light bathroom reading."
5,Very true remarks of where Christianity is going in the U.S.,"Calvin Miller is right on the money in his interpretation of how the U.S. Christian churches are following the commercialization of religion in ""ME""ga sizing churches like fast food restaurants now. Instead of being available to the congregation in times of sorrow and true spiritual need, the ""pastors"" are not avialable to their ""flock"" on an individual basis and no longer know the congreation by first names. He also mentions how everything is ""numbers"" now--just preaching to the masses. The personal touch is disappearing, especially in the larger communities, and that may be why people are shying away from religion at a rapid rate, because it is no longer filling the need it used to when church communities were smaller. Excellent book, I strongly recommend it to theoligians in particular, so they'll take their ""true vocation"" more seriously."
4,Faulty Clock,I liked the clock but it didn't work. I contacted the seller and was promptly refunded.
4,For North-America ideal,"Very nice and representative fotos. Good description of genera, however it is related more to North-America than to the world."
3,Needing a beginners help,"I purchased this book since I am new at this and needed good glossy pictures of the palms to identify them. However, the pics are clustered together with the foreign names identifying them, unfortunately not names of which they are commonly called in Florida. It is with great difficulty to find the info on them once you find the pic you are trying to identify. I have looked thru it twice and now is on top shelf of bookcase. Best book I've seen however on glossy pictures."
2,Too Technical For Anyone Other Than A Palm Ph.D.,Looking for identification and care instructions. Found neither. It is a big dust collector.
2,Disappointed,This was not one of Julia Quinn‘s better stories. I was bored with the story and found myself turning pages just to get done with it.
2,Ok is all...,"This HAS to be one of Quinn's first works because holy moly it shows! I went out and bought a handful of her books after I read ""When He Was Wicked""; now that was soooo good, but I have been severely unimpressed with the couple novels I've read (or tried real hard to read). Here's hoping I didn't waste my money by purchasing more than one of her books wanting at least a descent read."
2,Nowhere near her best,"I read the later Julia Quinn books first and was rather disappointed by this one. I agree with the other reviewer who said ""get over it"". The premise behind the hero's issues/guilt are a bit far fetched. If you haven't read any of Quinn's books, don't start with this one."
2,"Not yoga, not very fun","As my 2 year old put it, ""This is dumb."" The yoga leader is very corny (it's hard to even watch). Also, the Namaste song as well as the letter ""O"" standing for ""Om"" (followed by children chanting ""Om"") was over the top for us. I will say, though, that Om was the only thing yoga about it. There were very few actual yoga poses. Instead, the leader flopped around like a caterpillar and butterfly. My daughter actually much prefers doing my yoga videos with me - Rodney Yee and some prenatal videos. Maybe I'll look for some plain exercise DVDS..."
4,good for young kids,"I bought this DVD for my daughter. I sometimes feel like I don't know how to play or interact with her, so I use this video as a time to play with her a be silly. It is fun. Although she is not able to do most of the poses yet, she love that I am on her level groweling, flying, quacking, rocking. Its great Mommy-daughter time for me, and it also good exersise. I don't care for the nanaste song so I just push the forward button and go to the next letter. I let my friend borrow the video and her kid are about 5 and 6 and they thought it was dumb."
2,Not as expected ...,My grandchild was quickly bored with this video. I expected more yoga based on the description. Knowing it would not be used I gave it away.
5,My son loves this dvd!,"My son wants to do ABC Yoga every day. Not only has it teached him different yoga poses and letters of the alphabet, but also words those letters start with. I have fun watching it with him, and so does my husband. Highly recommended."
2,so hard to understand,"The prose in this book is so choppy that it is incoherent and impossible to follow (case in point: ""Mariotte was interested in the physics of gases and in the sound of the trumpet; he wrote The Treatise on Percussion""). It was nice to see illusions grouped by type but there is not much explicit discussion of how and why each illusion constitutes a member of that class. I also found that there were far too many examples and far too little discussion of the science behind the examples. If you are looking for a book with all kinds of random snippets of interesting illusions, this is good (maybe as a coffee table book?)."
1,Didn't work at all..,"Not sure how this claims to work- When you pour down the drain it immediately bubbles and smokes, the drain would have to be plugged close to the opening as it would be hard to get down the drain- Anyway kinda cool to watch it work, but it has horrible reviews elsewhere and bad for sink and god forbid you get it on your skin or breathe it in!"
3,meh,Meh. The cards are of a flimsier material than I expected. They are also smaller than expected. They will suffice.
1,Jobar Folding Clothes Rack,"I was not pleased with this clothes rack. I have an old one that I like and wanted another just like it. The Jobar rack was poorly made. Some screws were not long enough to even reach the hole they were to be screwed into. One of the welded pieces fell out while assembling the unit. On the whole, I felt the rack was worthless. The concept is good as I said, and my old unit [about 8 years old] is still going strong."
1,collector's backgammon case,I should have read reveiws before purchaseing very cheap out of box look like a child put it together i should return it but i will lose money so i will give it to a nine year old . and purchase a really one for grow up !!!!!!
2,A mish-mash of articles that's not very actionable.,"I had recently purchased the NielsenNorman group's International User Interfaces whitepaper, ..., was impressed with the whitepaper, and consequently had high hopes for this book. I was pretty disappointed. It's a mish-mash of articles, only a few of which were very actionable. One such article, in chapter 3, is pretty good in that it covers to what degree various cultures communicate explicitly versus non-explicitly. This fact alone is very useful to anyone doing usability testing or market research outside the US."
4,what any sw developer should know,"We also recommend the book ""SW Internationalization and Localization"" by Uren, Howard, Perinotti."
1,The always reliable Francis disappoints,"As a fan reader of Francis, I must say that this book really disappointed me. As someone already mentioned in his review: a good beggining, then at half the way, the book falls into a self-complacent and too convenient ending. As a portrait of English politics, Jeffrey Archer's ""First Among Equals"" is a much better read. From Francis, I will always prefer the elegance of ""Banker""."
4,"Interesting, but not the usual quality from Mr. Francis","As someone who has read all of Mr. Francis' books, I truthfully have to say that 10 LB Penalty is not his best work. I enjoyed reading it and like all of his other books left me with a strong desire to visit England and hopefully meet some of the wonderful characters who live in his imagination. As I was reading the other reviews, I also wonder if a ""ghost writer"" is being used. The tone of this book is Dick Francis, but it is a little off, not up to his standards."
2,10 pound snooze,"This book was dissappointing. There was very little mystery, and no thrill. The best part was the attempted sabotage of the automobile, but even that was not followed up well. I found it hard to believe that Julliard's rise in British politics went so fast. Dick Francis has a great reputation. Surely his other work is better."
3,not very exciting,"Although you can't ever go really wrong with Dick Francis, this book is one of his weakest. There just isn't a whole lot of excitement. The villans are pretty tame and the storyline pretty dull. Not a bad book, but not great."
3,This one is a disappointment.,"The idea of a 17 year old having the presence of mind depicted in this story is difficult to believe. This young man had virtually none of the adversity growing up as other central Francis characters. I can't argue that he isn't smart; I just feel the character is not believable. The plot is all right, but the end can be predicted by the middle of the book. It had little of the suspense of other Francis books, such as Banker. I found myself not picking up the book at every chance, a major departure from reading other Francis books. Dick Francis is a great, great writer who has given millions of people many hours of reading pleasure. While entertaining, this one just wasn't up to his standards. I sincerely hope the next one rekindles his old fire."
4,an evening's pleasant read,"I wondered as I read 10 lb Penatly why so many of the reviewers (all admitted DF fans) panned this book. While 10 lb Penatly will never be my favorite, I certainly don't feel I wasted my money on this story. I think part of the problem, if there is one, is that the protagonist is so young (he ages from 17 to his early 20's). And, although the title is a racing term, the story in 10 lb Pentaly does not revolve around the racing world that readers have come to know and love from Mr. Francis' work. So, if you like Dick Fancis, I'd say give this one a try."
3,Seller went above and beyond,"This has been a long process -- these action figures don't hold up, and the first one arrived broken. Seller responded quickly and sent out a new one, which didn't arrive, so seller sent out a third, which arrived in great shape. The seller really went above and beyond for this transaction. I would buy from this seller again (hopefully with no problems!)."
5,Absolutely wonderful. Bogarde was an exceptional writer.,"The first book I had ever read by Dirk Bogarde was AN ORDINARY MAN. I couldn't wait to read the rest of his books and now have a fairly complete collection. A POSTILLION STRUCK BY LIGHTNING is one the best, full of humor, insight into human frailities, and pure craftsmanship. I'd recommend it to everyone. When I first read AN ORDINARY MAN I wrote him a fan letter addressed to his publisher. Remarkably, they passed the letter on to him and I received the most charming response. We carried on a correspondence right up to the time he became ill. It was so sad to learn of his death."
3,Funny they are selling this....,"Anyone remeber when Let's Go first came out, this single was bundled with it for free... now they are selling it. Oh well if you didn't get it with let's go, I bet you could write the band and they will send you a tape of it :) Besides, only one of these songs are unreleased now... since roots radicals is on ...and out come the wolves."
4,This is a useful item,"If your exterior door sweep is worn out, this is an inexpensive and easy to install fix. It just snaps onto the bottom of the door. You can screw it on if needed but I haven't had any issue with it moving without screws. My only complaint is that the factory shrink wrap compresses the fins. I had to heat up and 're-bend' the fins to get them to stand up again."
1,Disappointing,"I found this study guide very disappointing. It contains a single practice test that consists of a mere 100 questions. The actual test is 120 questions. Additionally, the answer choices are A-E, while the sample answer sheet is A-D.It lays out a study plan that essentially tells you to go re-read all of your business text books. That's not especially helpful.In order to be an acceptable study guide, it would need to contain a minimum of two full (120 questions each) practice tests. That way, you could take the first practice test to assess your study needs. Then, after you have studied, you could take the second practice test to determine your readiness to take the actual test.In order to be a great study guide, it would need to contain three or four full practice tests."
4,I have had these platters for years (bought two) for fruit display,"These did not have the Corelle texture we're all accustomed to. These are a rougher sort of stoneware. But I've had them for years now. I used them to put my fresh fruit--apples, pears, oranges, bananas--on the table. I think they have a rustic charm and enjoy them. But don't expect the Corelle typical feel/look."
3,"YogaKids, Vol. 3: Silly to Calm",this video is ok... I have used it for ages 3 to 5 and have found children at these ages would either like more instruction on how to do the poses as well as learn more poses or would rather more capturing animation related to popular kids movie stories such as the Disney series...
5,My 2.5 yr old adores this video!!!,"I purchased this video a few weeks ago for my 2.5 yr old son. My son is VERY high energy and since it's Fall and soon will be Winter I wanted to find exercises to do with him indoors so he won't be bouncing off the walls. This video is EXCELLENT! At first he didn't get it but after I showed him how to do the moves he loved it! He actually picked this DVD over his Brainy Baby and Baby Einstein videos! The lady's voice is very calm and reassuring and the dvd is informative wich I enjoy and my son does as well (learning about nature, our bodies, some words in sanscript etc). Most importantly the video actually WORKS. We did it an hour ago as a matter of fact. My son was bouncing around and acting silly towards the beginning of the video but towards the end he was actually calm and still is an hour later. I can't recommend this DVD enough!"
4,IF TURKEYS SAID AAAHHHH!,"This is a handy litle test thermometer that is easy to read, and folds into a piece about 5"" long for easy storage in a kitchen drawer.Some thermometers are difficult to decipher - this is not with temps calibrated by 25 degree increments, and numbers that you don't need a magnifying glass to read.Also, our old thermometer had a tendency to ""steam"" so that it was difficult to read..The proper reading on this thermometer is available almost instantly - another plus."
2,"Excellent w/ background in Wrestling, Hapkido, or Ju-Jitsu","I fail to see the reasoning from the review titled ""It looks nice but.............., November 19, 2000""The main problem I have in this persons article is that I know for fact (and from personal experience) that these are extremely effective techniques. In fact the techniques presented in this book are several times more effective in a real situation than a normally applied strike.And also, an angry person who ""wants to rip your face off,"" is always easier to defeat than an assailant with a clear mind and excellent coordination.Further more, this is a book pointed towards advanced practices. That means they require practice. No technique will be effective without sufficient practice.In conclusion, this book is an great adjunct to your knowledge if you have a background in wrestling, hapkido, or ju-jitsu."
3,A decent Punk/Oi album,"Total Chaos definitely should have stuck to playing hardcore. Pledge of Defiance was one of the best CD's ever! This album has a few keepers(Boot Party, Riot City 2, Baby I Hate you, 12 Ounce Pounders)but lacks really thought out lyrics. Overall, an OK album."
2,Geat sound and features \ Bad drivers,"I bought this card a year ago because I had problems with my SB live not working with microsoft game voice, which was required by my former Mechwarrior 4 gaming clan. It did everything I needed: 3D sound, on-line chat and a joy stick port. Then a month later I converted to XP Home and all hell broke loose. I tried the Win 2000 driver and it registered as ""device is working normally"" but did not. I then tried the PSC705 windows XP driver and got wave sound but no mic or joysick. I had to go back to my SB live which is almost dead. I recommend getting the SB audogy. All the others especially C-Media are incomplete and inadequete."
3,Hole in my Life,"Hole in my Life was an interesting piece that takes anyone back to a time their own lives when being young meant you could take on the world. There are many teens that go through troubling times in their lives, involving drugs, jail, prison. This book relates to troubled teens in showing that Gantos himself sold illegal drugs, was imprisoned for years but rose from the ashes to be reborn and become a great writer. It may have cost him years locked away in a cell by himself but he turned his life around and used his writing to overcome his bad experience as an inmate."
4,High School Interest Level,"I have talked with my high school students about the fact that although there are defining moments in life, we should not let one moment define who we are for the rest of our lives. This is a great story to exemplify this point! Although drug use and sales are important components of the novel (and serve to attract the attention of adolescent readers), drugs are not glorified, which is an important point that parents and educators should be aware of if asked to defend this book choice. It can also be used for students to see how one author ""found his voice"" and became a writer. Interesting read that will hold the attention of even reluctant readers."
5,lesser-known screwball classic,"Irene Dunne is always good, and this is one of her finest performances, typical screwball mistaken identities, well worth the time to see."
2,So-So-At-Best Screwball,"I guess the reason I had never heard of these particular screwball films is that they are very forgettable. These films are nothing better than okay. The plots are very lame in my opinion. I was so looking forward to watching these films, but after viewing them, it felt like a wasted evening."
2,"Sailor""s review of this book","Being a sailor myself I bought this book with great expectation of entertainment in reading about an adventurous sailing journey. I was very disappointed. There was very little data given about the boat, its gear, and sailing tactics. The book was about what they did when they got there. The author would go on and on about people and places in Iceland and Scandanavia that you could not pronounce; yet, I still don't know what brand of Diesel engine the vessel had, its displacement or horse power. Sail plan, displacement, keel type, etc., are still a mystery. No pictures or data charts. Did a vessel really exist?In fact, while reading this book I got the feeling that the author sat at his computer and downloaded information about these places and wrote the book with his imaginationSo, after reading about 2/3, the book got tossed.Richard Byrd"
2,Does this author have an editor?,"This is a brilliant and fascinating subject matter, however, I could not for the life of me decide how a Ph.D. author could possibly get a book published with so many English spelling and grammar errors that I had to check repeatedly the front cover for the name of the author. I thought perhaps English was not his first language. But a Ph.D? And a name like Dennis Stevens? Well, in any case, there were so many completely unbelievable spelling, grammar, and syntax errors that unfortunately these over-shadowed what may have been a good book. Also, be forewarned: If you CAN get past the errors, this author loves statistics, he does his studies by interviewing actual inmates or felons/criminals themselves, then goes on to say less about the mind of the criminal than the statistics of the crimes they are likely to commit. I usually pass on my books. This one is trash. I gave it two stars because there actually was a paragraph or two that made sense."
3,Sticky and not as delicious,"While this ferret food is more nutritious than the ferret food Tim (6 months old) is used to, he does not enjoy eating this. We read that ferrets do not recognize new food so we mixed 1/4 scoop of this with 3/4 of his old food and he selectively left the ULTIMATE food in his tray uneaten. After 2 weeks of trying this we got fed up. The pellets themselves are sticky and soft which might me nice for a ferret who will eat them, but when left for over a day they smell terrible and go stale. His excretions also appear to be less solid while he's had this food in his bowl. We're hoping to find the same stuff in a harder form."
2,Not nearly as good as Harry,"I was told this book was similar to the Harry Potter series, but it is no where near as clever, interesting, or fun. Hopefully the series will get better as the story progresses."
1,Midnight for an ailing author,"Amongst others, fantasy is a genre I love. I read much of the literature, but this book left me cold. It was so bad, I felt compelled to read it all, in the vain hope that it would improve. The narrative is sloppy, the premise mediocre; quite honestly, unless you are very young indeed, this book should be kept on the shelf. I found the plot to be overly simple, and, if you intend to read this to a child over the age of 12, don't expect it to strech their imagination. The only thing it streched was my patience..."
4,Midnight for Charlie Bone,I love Harry Potter and am anxiously awaiting the next book. This gives me something and I thought it was a good book. it definitely is not as advanced reading. I would say that a 10 year old would probably be able to read this. I cant wait to get the next book in this series. How many are there???...
3,Midnight or Noon,"Pretty good book. Seems like a Harry Potter knock off, but Nimmo has her own style. May be a better read for 4-6 graders than Harry- its a lot shorter and not as involved. I will definately recommend it to my language arts classes"
4,Fun Book for Fantasy lovers,"Great and original fun. While it has some similarities to the Harry Potter series, in many ways it is more original. I am 48 years old and the last few years I have read a few of the fantasy series for older children and I find that they are producing better, more interesting, more original, and certainly funner reads than those penned for adults. I look forward to the future work of this talented writer."
4,A hard to stop reading Book,Midnight for Charlie Bone is the best book ever read. It is so exciting I could not stop reading the book. The book is about a child who has a gift that he can here peop talking in photographs. Anybody who likes fantasy books will love Midnight for Charlie Bone.
5,Wickedly Funny,"Charlie Bone likes soccer and TV, but not much else. He likes to hang out with his next-door neighbor and best friend, Benjamin Brown, and Benjamin's dog, Runner Bean. For Charlie, life is pretty good.Until...One rainy night, Charlie's three great-aunts show up at his doorstep: Venitia, Lucretia, and Eustacia, along with Charlie's grandmother, Grandma Bone. Unlike Charlie's mother's mother, Grandma Maisie, Grandma Bone is very cruel, cold, and has a strong dislike when it comes to Charlie.Charlie is related to the Yewbeams, and ancient magical family who have possessed many special abilities throughout the past: Hypnotism, Telekenisis, and Sorcery, just to name a few. Charlie has inherited one of their powers, and now, he is being shipped off to Bloor's Academy, where he will have to stay five days a week, only to come home on weekends.And life couldn't get worse.Or could it?"
5,Definitely a book I would read over and over again.,"This book is DEFINITELY a book to read while you wait for the next Harry Potter or Lemony Snicket book to come out. It will keep you on the edge of you seat the whole way through. And, since all of the books are now out, you don't have to wait for the next book in the series to come out, as with Harry Potter or Lemony Snicket. THIS IS THE FIRST BOOK IN THE SERIES!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Similar to Harry Potter but still enjoyable,"Certain parts of this series are very, VERY similar to Harry Potter except that the antagonist is Charlie Bone's own grandmother and he lives with her. Too funny!"
1,I kept thinking it would get better...,"But it didn't. I even read the next 2 in the series, hoping things would look up. All in vain. The characters were flat, the plot was uninteresting, and Charlie was one of the dullest heros I've ever had the displeasure to encounter. Reading these books was like walking down a street in the suburbs and looking in the windows - sometimes boring, sometimes a bit more interesting, but you can't hear what's going on and don't know enough to care.One other thing - I've read all the reviews (20 pages!) and I've seen people state that this would be appropriate for younger ages. Almost as if they're trying to say that a book for younger readers is allowed to be written poorly. This seems so wrong to me. I read and reread children's books all the time, and my favorite books are ones that are well written, whether it's A Wrinkle in Time or Green Eggs and Ham."
4,great book,okay some pepople have called this a rip off of harry potter but if it is a rip off its a great one. chalrie adventure are excitng and its the kind of book you just cant put down. i cnt wait for the next ones. i wonder how amny there will be.
3,Midnight for Charlie Bone,"I think that you should read"" Midnight for Charlie Bone"" by Jenny Nimo. Charlie Bone is a boy with special powers to see into pictures and hear what happened when the picture was taken. When his aunts find out about his powers they send him off to Bloors, a school where talented (and I mean any talent) children go to school. Bloors is never a safe school. There is also an emotionless girl, that Charlie helps get back to normal. ""Midnight for Charlie Bone"" is very suspenseful and funny. ""Midnight for Charlie Bone"" is an excellent book. Like Harry potter both main characters have special powers. When I read Charlie Bone I feel brave. I recommend Midnight for Charlie Bone to everyone."
1,"You Again, should be Not Again","Very Disappointing as I think it is a fantastic cast of actors. Luckily rented from redbox and was only a dollar, as I planned to purchase it, until I saw the movie. I love Betty White, this movie did not do her justice or the other cast members. Too Bad!"
2,GOOD CAST SAVES THIS MEDIOCRE ROM COM FROM BEING A COMPLETE DISASTER!,"While 'You Again' is certainly watch-able trite, it really doesn't offer much in the way of laughs or insight into the subjected theme of the film. The cast does what it can with this familiar story and Betty White is always welcome, but in the end this one is a rental at best. At least the end cameo is a small payoff and dilutes the stale taste a little bit."
3,Great chance for revenge,"A girl who used to be picked on and bullied, quite brutally, but the most popular girl in school gets a chance for revenge. What a great scenario. To be able to prove to everyone who thought you were a loser that you actually aren't and that you have a superior life compared to theirs. From the trailer, it seemed like a really fun comedy that plays on this fantastic circumstance. There were definitely some great moments and hilarious moments borught on by the brilliant actresses. But I have to say that I was not entertained the whole way through. I think it sort of veered off the course of comedy towards the end and it seemed like the movie could not decide if it was going to be comedy or drama. It was disaapointing as the material was fantastic. But I'm generously giving it three stars."
5,"Excellent book to ""get your feet wet"" in particle physics.","This book does a great job explaining the basics of particle physics. It does not go into great detail (equations, principles, etc); it is an introduction.I find particle physics (actually all fundamental physics) intriguing. I do not aim to understand quantum physics at the level of a physicist (calculations, equations, etc.); I simply want to know the models and concepts. This book did a satisfactory job of exposing me to the models and concepts."
4,Nice Little Book,It helps to have a little knowledge of chemistry and physics but overall a very good introduction!
1,Had to file claim,After waiting a month I never received this study guide. I then contacted the seller and got no feed back. I then had to file a claim with amazon.com through their guarantee program and I received a full refund.
1,Don't waste your money,This book is terrible. The bulk of the text is redundant codeexamples which server as filler to an otherwise empty book.
4,Good book for game programming beginners...,"Being a VB programmer myself, with very little exposure to C++, I found this book to be a wonderful read and a great help in getting me started on the road to programming my own games (which, by the way, is the reason I became a programmer to begin with).Sousa offers great lessons on C++, which any newbie can clearly understand, with excellent examples and a marvelous teaching style. There are, however, some problems with the book (hence the 4 star rating). Most of the screen shots aren't anywhere near the code they are supposed to support, and a lot of the notes and side tips don't seem to belong to the text they are paraphrasing/helping.Also, in some code examples he tends to go about things the round-about way, instead of attacking the problem directly.All in all, I can look past the problems this book has and say that if you want to be a game programmer, buy and read this book before you get anything else. This book will definitely get you on your way!"
1,Terrible! Worst service!,I ordered this book on October 30th... I needed It for a psychology paper due at the en of November... I paid by credit card... The book still isn't here! And I had to get a last minutes book off of my friend for the paper... Im displeased and I do not reccomend anyone to order from this user!
3,"Not a bad game fot it's day, but it's looking very dated","This game is an old DOS based game, the graphics are terrible, the charechters are flat, and the resolution is stuck in 320x240. I dont know how the sound is because it wont work with my windows ME sound card driver. The game play is not that bad and the levels are interesting but the lousy graphics serve to somewhat ruin this. This isn't a bad game it's just not as good as some of the other FPS's out there."
5,Star Wars: Dark Forces,"I love Dark Forces. I like the graphics--not as sharp as Jedi Knight, but not as 'conical' either. I enjoy the music. But, more than anything, I love the storyline. Dark Forces is lively and fun, with interesting puzzles.My only complaint with Dark Forces was that they never offered an expansion pack. I'm currently installing a second OS on my computer so I can run Dark Forces again--it won't run under Windows XP.I have no interest in ""Jedi: Outcast.""And since it seems to be standard in these reviews... The Empire Strikes Back--best story, best visuals. Star Wars--great story, good action. Attack of the Clones--best action, decent visuals (more is not better), ok story. Phantom Menace--good visuals, good story. Return of the Jedi--good story."
4,Great Game,Great game for its day but can be anoying when you get stuck.My advice to you is if you have Jedi Outcast don't buy this becuase dark forces is currently be remade with jedi outcast engine as a mod for jedi outcast. It is rumored though that the mod may be completed for jedi academy. For more information on dark forces mod go to www.darkforces.jediknight.com
1,What happened Laurell K?,"I was a fan of the Anita series from the beginning. The last couple books were dissapointing, but I went ahead and bought this one in the hopes things would have improved. They have not. The nearly non-existent plot takes a back seat to the gratuitous sex scenes. The characters have stopped developing along with any interesting story lines. I'm sad to say that I'm now giving up on this series. This will be the last Anita book I read."
1,Extremely Disappointing,"This book did not have enough progression of the plot. There was too much sex thrown in at every opportunity. This, like the last few Anita Blake books, was a disappointment for me. I loved the series for a long time, but I am so disappointed at the lack of character development and plot. And no, I don't count getting tons of new powers as character development. This series used to have great supernatural politics, some romance, detective stuff, etc. Now it's just sex, sex, sex. I can't continue to read this series until there is a balance. It's ok to have sex, if it furthers the plot. It can't be the only plot. There needs to be more to the books than just sex. I'd have given this book 0 stars, but there was not that option, so it received 1 star."
3,A little disappointing,"I've been reading the Anita Blake books ever since the first book came out. I really enjoyed reading it at the beginning, and I couldn't wait for Danse Macabre when I heard that it was coming out...However, when I got down to reading it, I just stopped about midway, because it started to get a little boring...However, now that I've finished it, I must say that it's not one of her best works...I found that the book was a little too long and draggy...I'm hoping that her new book next year will be better."
3,And the plot was missing why?,"Danse Macabre was and interesting book in terms of character development but it lacked any real story. All of the Previous Anita Blake books have had some kind of mystery were as this one did not. The book was full of the same thing over and over again. Anita fights with some one, has sex with some one, fights with someone else, has sex with some one else, etc... It was not a horrible book but I did expect more and was disappointed not to get it."
2,"succubus, I get it already",This book had so much story line potential. Instead we had 350 pages worth of erotica. Where has the plot line gone for the Anita Blake series!
3,Don't believe what you see,Disappointed that the book cover was not the same as displayed in amazon. The cover I saw displayed ballet slippers on the cover and one I received had pliers ?!
1,Vintage Anita fan,"When I first discovered Anita Blake 2 years ago I was at the book store like a pregnant woman looking for pickles. Well, those days are over. I am sadly disappointed with this latest incarnation of Anita Blake. I have no problem with a tantalizing sex scene. But, these scenes have gone from tantalizing to repetitive to downright boring.Where are the bad guys? Where are the cops? Where is Anita's job? Where are the zombies? Where is the story? Where is the mystery? The vampire ballet, which seemed to be the point of the whole story, didn't appear until well into the third and final act. There was ample opportunity for the visiting vamps to have brought mayhem with them as was seen in Burnt Offerings. But, no dice.This is the last Anita Blake story I'll ever buy. I'm sorry to say that unless Laurell K. Hamilton can take the time to develop a real story, I'll also have to abstain from her Meredith Gentry series as well. It's also gone the way of the thin and plotless."
1,My Anita died a book ago,"Like most of you, hope upon hope of finding the inside of Anita-that wasn't eaten away by some new disease upon disease -left in this book, it's become clear to me, yes she is indeed gone. I for one love change, luv luv luv it, but it seems to me the only character who has kept hit wit and stayed interesting here is richard. funny that, i never liked him much to begin with. Anita has zero personality, no more quotes from these books will be put on coffee mugs. I cant even remember what the plot was- i read it twice. As for the politics? What was political about it?? Does she even work at all now?(anita).The sex isnt ranchy, alluring, deep, or dark- its a space filler. And my cats ( i have quite a few) dont even have that much sex, so it isnt an animal similarity thing coming through, so come on...all i can say is what a waste of a tree....""if i let you die, the other bodyguards will make fun of me.."" the all are."
1,Cape Cod,"Line of dialogue from Hamilton's new opus Danse Macabre:'Welcome, Samuel, Master of the City of Cape Cod.'Cape Cod is a Peninsula in Massachusetts comprised of many towns, No cities. Get a clue, do some research.These books are lame.I give it a 0 but the drop down box does not provide that."
1,Has Hamilton forgot that this is a vampire hunter series?,"It seems as though she has forgot the basic element of her book which is vampire hunter series.This book was so disappointing. Nothing was resolved and basically no plot. Well maybe there is the plot of sex and pillow talk but other than that I really can't see it.I loved her books where Anita is actually hunts vampires, solves cases and has sometype of personal life. Now its all sex and personal life how boring."
4,My first read in the series and i came back for more...,"i have read so many bad reviews on this book of the series. concerns with characters and their development. my thought on that subject is that everyone grows and changes, including characters in a book. i agree this is one of my least favorite in the series, but it was the first one that i read and i liked the basis of it enough to know that i wanted to read more from the start to the newest releases. yes, i am a devoted anita blake fan."
2,worst book in series,I am really disappointed in this book. The author got so mixed up in writing a vulger porn novel she forgot to finish the main point of the story. The ending leaves you wondering if this is a two part book and also makes even a fan doubt buying another book. I wish I had waited till this one hit the clearance rack.
1,No Story all Sex,I used to like her books because Anita was always working on a case and there was a point to the book. This book is just about sex and possible pregnancy. I kept waiting for some kind of plot to develop or for them to take a break from the sex and actually do something but it just kept going until the book ended. Someone needs to make Hamilton sit down and reread her first 4 or 5 Anita Blake novels so she can remember what it was like when should could actually write a story. It is sad to say but I think this book has killed this series for me.
2,Dissapointed,"Once again I am disappointed with the latest Anita Blake book. There is absolutely no plot, just continuous orgies. I really hope Hamilton will start writing with the flair that she showed in her earlier books."
1,Another author fallen to her own press,"I am sad to say this was more of the recent garbage. Sex as a tool is fine, but I started reading this series for the action, adventure, and sex. Now I'll have to find something else to read. Anita has fallen to the whims of an author that keeps confusing her two series.The sex scenes are mediocre and the editing is poor.I will no longer throw good money after bad"
2,Meh,"I really used to enjoy the Anita Blake books, but lately they have been a dissapointment. This book was ok, better then the last one at least. For the most part it seemed like this one was ment to tie up some loose ends and pave the way for the next book. If she follows through with that and goes back to her old (and better) writing style, I think the series can get back on track. This book is much like Pirates 2; it is the longest trailer for the next story I have ever seen. *Fingers area crossed for the next book*"
2,BORING,"I am very much an Anita Blake fan, despite her nerve-wracking immaturity. I agree with some of the reviewers here that this book was pretty boring. I didn't feel the plot was great and WHEN is the ardeur going to calm down? Has Laurell decided that she's going to write sex scenes without a good story? I am so happy that I stopped buying these books and now get them from the library because I would consider this a waste of money."
1,yuk,This series started out great. Now it's just the tiniest of plots to hold together a ton of porn. No thanks. This was my last Anita Blake.
3,Disappointing,"I am halfway through the book and I am bored. I agree with the reviewers who find the sex scenes repetetive and too long. It seems as if Hamilton is methodically and not especially creatively describing every possible permutation of men in Anita's bed. I will finish the book, but in small doses over several days. I think there are interesting moments in the book, but it would have been improved by some careful editing and pruning. At the moment I prefer the Princess Meredith series to this one."
1,Why does she bother?,"Ok, see if you can guess what book this is from:""You have to pick a lover, Anita."" ""No."" ""But you must."" ""Ummmm, ok."" OR ""I hate you Anita. I want the picket fence."" ""Sorry, I don't."" OR ""My beast was seeking his beast."" I could go on and on, but why bother? Hamilton does it for us.I found this to be the worst book of hers so far. Anita must have had sex 20 times in 24 hours. The next book should be called: Ho Lotta Sex!"
2,Another disappointment :(,"This is just as bad as Micah: 'Anita Blake' seems to have completely lost her way. Our heroine slogs from one end of the novel to the other armed only with an increasingly worn mattress.Hamilton's kickass, take-no-prisoners character continues to wander aimlessly in the trackless, emotional swamp of her love/sex life while gaining ever more grandiose and pointless powers.Don't waste your money on this stinker. Either reread the earlier 'Anita Blake' books or treat yourself to one of Jim Butcher's 'Harry Dresden', Charlaine Harris's 'Sookie Stackhouse', or Kim Harrison's 'Rachel Morgan' books. Plenty of action to go around in any of them."
1,Anita Blake cause of death - BAD WRITING!,"I'm no prude but bad writing and weak plot lines do not drive repeat sales.I've never been more disappointed with a book, make that last four in the series. When I first got introduced to this series the characters were so vivid and neatly drawn that each additional titile revealed more but still left substancial mystery to the on-going story. But these last few titles have dropped to bad porn writing, the sex is too techinical and the characters are now bad reflections of what they were in the begining. I mean Ms, H really needs to read Anne Rampling's aka Anne Rice's Beauty Series to learn how to write erotica or pick up a copy of Dave Benbow's Hunk House for some real fun and quick sex scenes. I can honestly say that I intend to drop Ms. H from my must read list, talk about good money thrown away on empty words."
1,I think I like the Bite!,Weird but sexy and exciting. I must admit it's a good read! So whens the next one coming out?
3,No Longer a Vampire Hunter...needs to be renamed Vampire Hooker,"The series really interests me and there are potential Evils looming on the horizon with promise, and Anita remains a compelling character, but I am reallly getting bored with the Anita (and Merry Gentry) story line of Laurell, oops, Anita, surrounding herself with all those beautiful monsters. I'd like some progress in moving beyond the ardeur and back into the murky realm of the fight between what good and evil are."
2,Blah Blah Blah Sex Sex Sex,"Man this book sucks. I had a little hope in the beginning - when the first 25 pages weren't hardcore porn. But it quickly devolved to that and stayed there through the entire novel. No character development. No interesting plot. Just an endless stream of sexual escapades with so many men that I can't keep them straight anymore.Like many others, this was my last shot for Hamilton's work. It's just not compelling anymore. If I wanted porn, I'd buy porn."
1,Danse Macbre,"If you enjoy Anita and her many men having sex, more sex, and then more sex. Then this is the book for you.I felt like there were sex scenes tied together by a few scenes where things started to happen that could have been interesting to read bout, but they fizzled out, like the siren. At the end of the book there was a sentence or two explaining how that was going to work out with a couple of the weak plot points that showed up between orgies.I think Anita spent more time with her clothes off, having sex, talking about sex, or talking about the effects of the sex and ardeur than anything else."
3,Wow . . and not in a good way,"I finished this book a couple weeks ago and I'm feeling disappointed truthfully. I am really beginning to miss the old days when Anita would shoot someone first and mull over the moral implications later. I liked sociopathic Anita and I'm not too fond of the were-slut that's taken her place. It's hard to seem tough when she's naked and screwing all the time. She's boring and becoming cry baby mental case. Most the cast is getting weepy, their damage and baggage further slowing the plot. Yeah, I'll probably keep reading the books, because they are good for something, just not as much as before.As a fan, I'm begging you, Ms. Hamilton. Please get over, around, or through the sexual fixation, and jumpstart your plot. At this point, I don't care who is doing who, I want to know who will live or die."
2,Just bad.,"Another series killer, though at least (unlike Goodkind) the first several books of the Anita Blake Vampire Hunter series were fun little supernatural mysteries.Literally no plot, though there were a couple of strands of something that might have become a plot if the author had bothered to develop them.Mostly very boring and badly written sex scenes, very boring and badly written scenes of vampire politics (all revolving around whose servants could enter into sexual service to Anita Blake next), and endless emo yammering about sex. Yuck. This is what happens when writers go bad."
1,What a disappointment!,"Such a dreadful betrayal of Hamilton's loyal readers! Her last couple of books were slowly slipping in quality, but I keep reading them, hoping against hope that she'll return to the stellar writing of her early work. I know sex sells, but this is ridiculous!"
1,Bedroom Boredom,"I love Anita Blake novels. I even enjoy the later ones w/the sex. But this book, just didn't do it for me. Chapter one was promising and then nothing. She goes into the bedroom and never comes out until the last few chapters. I was wanting for so much more regarding the visiting Master's and the Ballet. But by the time Anita gets to the ballet, it almost felt like the ballet was an after thought. Will I keep reading this series? Absolutely. One book does not make or break a series."
1,"Sorry Anita, sorry everybody who loves this series","If you took the sex out of this(not that I have anything against sex, but this is just obsessive and endless to the point of boring.) it would be about a 100 page terribly disjointed novella with an absolutely awful ending: It just kind of falls away with no resolution at all.Dang Laurell what happened to you. Where did Anita go?I'm hoping for better in the next Merry Gentry story.Man that's sad."
1,"Not even worth one star, maybe half a star if that","Its been a long time since I read a book that made me repeat, oh brother, in disgust and disbelief. How sad to see this series so far down in the dumps. Its been going downhill for awhile, Micah was a waste of paper, and this is just barely better. I stopped reading LK for awhile, then came across Micah for .25 cents, sad to say that was a total waste of a quarter. I cannot recommend you buy this book, if you must read it then borrow it from a library, that way you'll only have wasted your time and not your money. Sad sad sad, I loved the first books. oh well!"
3,Not as bad as the last couple....,"I think Laurell K. is finally starting to listen to her fans! This book actually had a little plot in it instead of being straight erotica. In fact, Anita made it all the way to chapter 9 before having her clothes ripped off! Progress! I still miss the old Anita. And what happened to her work as the Executioner and with the police? She mentions it in passing, but she hasn't been on a case in awhile. Bring back Dolph and Edward!!!"
1,So sad...,"This book was the ending for me. I couldn't even finish it, and I've finished some pretty awful books. I started the series and immediately fell in love with it. After the first 2 books I was singing the praises and recommending the books to everyone! I love a good smut novel from time to time... but somewhere along the line Laurell Hamilton has gone way off base and started writing straight up porn. This book got to the point where there wasn't even a worthy story line to read in between the gratuitous sex scenes, and the sex scenes werent even written very well.Thank you LH for writing this piece of garbage and for ruining the story, I'm embarrassed that I even suggested the series to others."
1,The last book of the series for me,"The series has become boring and little more than badly written porn. I loved the whole ""in love with a vampire and a werewolf"" dynamic, and now Richard is one of the most boring characters in the series. I'd love to just slap the p*** out of him and tell him to get a grip!As for Anita, ""Oh, I haven't had sex in twelve hours and none of the five men with whom I am in a committed relationship is around, Oh! a random vampire, You will do me now, please.""I will not read anymore of this series."
3,getting repetitive,"I love this series, but its becoming all sex, no plot. I wish I had waited for paperback. There were some ideas that could've been expanded on and weren't. The arguments between the main characters became very repetitive, too, saying the same things over and over in slightly different phrasing, like she wanted a certain number of pages. Please, if you want to explore your sexuality, do like Anne Rice did and create a separate series. I miss the plots, dark humor, and action that used to make these books so great."
1,awful,"Where has the tough as nails executioner gone? She whines and gripes her way through this book and has to have even the simplest concepts explained to her repeatedly by the ""big strong men"" who wait on her hand and foot. Anita cried and moaned over EVERYTHING in this book. There was no plot whatsoever until you had read almost 300 pages and that was wrapped up in less than 100 pages. The dialogue read like something overheard at a junior high dance it was so filled with angst. I have loved Anita and reread all her books over and over until the last four. This series is becoming a huge diappointment. I'm not sure what has happened to Anita Blake, but please Laurell, bring her back."
2,Where are the cops or zombies?,Oh man I was so excited another Anita Blake book finally comes out and then you start reading and its just sex. Yeah they have to explain stuff thats going on but still there are no cops no work its just sex sex sex. Can't believe it was very disappointed!
1,another disappointment,"I have been an Anita Blake fan since the first book, buying them as soon as they came out. When they started publishing hard-cover books, I bought the same titles again to add to my permanent library.BUT in the past few books, I have been repeatedly disappointed with lack of plot. This book was the worse so far. Laurell, honey, jumping from dick to dick is not a plot! (a fantasy of yours perhaps, certainly a porno movie, but not really a STORY.)Couple of suggestions - cull the men. Kill off a dozen or so, its too cluttered. Less is more.Next get Anita back to her JOB. Remember that piece of business? Interacting with the police now and then? Making money, fighting the Bad Things (I refrain from adding ""not screwing them"".) You have backed yourself into a corner where there are no bad things anymore.I would love to see this series get back to where it was, when I couldn't wait for the next book.Best wishes LKH, I will keep my fingers crossed."
2,It will let you DOWN!!,"I'm a hardcore Anita Blake fan, but this book in the series is just really bad, It will let you down, somethings are answered but it's almost not worth the read. Too much sex and not even intertwined well with the overall of the story, it seems that she uses sex as a way to get passed some overall problem that Anita has at the moment in the story.Even though I read the hole thing, it was still a disappointment."
5,"Fantastic, Brilliant and Excellent","The Pay Per Click search engine marketing handbook is not a book, it is a tool.I have read the first 5 chapters and already i feel i'm half way there to creating a successfull PPC ad campaign.The tips in this book are simple and straight to the point, it tells you step by step on how to create a PPC ad campaign that generates results.Words cannot express how this book has helped me cure my fobia of PPC marketing.I srarted to read this book knowing hardly anything about PPC and already i feel confident on advertising via PPC methods.I would strongly recommend anyone advertising via PPC to purchase this highly powerfull book (tool)"
2,Not recommended,"The book covers the basics and has some other random information. It covers the Match Types(the most relevant stuff when it comes to adwords)in the passing.You will be better off reading the google knowledgebase at http://adwords.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer;=6100The ""Dummies for Adwords"" is a much better book than this and covers the topic in greater detail. I would definitely recommend that book over this one. (stay away from the Perry Marshall book as well. That's quite similar.)Ideally a PPC book should cover various PPC strategies and case studies, so users have a clear idea on what's happening in industry and what works and what doesn't."
5,Holiday Sitcom Classics,I really enjoyed this collection as it brought back many memories from my childhood (almost like watching an old family movie).
3,If you like fighting games,"This game is cool for those of you who like fighting games. The graphics are great and the blood is awsome. Other than that this game can get dull verry quickly. I bought it and exchanged it for another, it is a rental."
2,A little disappointed,"I bought this CD because I really like the track: ""Song Of Jabez"". When I got the CD and listened to the other songs I was disappointed and honestly found that I didn't like any of the other songs. But for the price ($3), it was worth getting the one song I did want."
1,Despicable,Features the worst red herring I've ever read. I only finished it because I could not believe that an acclaimed author would write something so painfully predictable. I was wrong--Koontz would and he did. An absolute waste of time.
3,Psyqic superstisiousness.,"Excitement of the best writer ever, Dean R. Koontz. Again he writes a book, which can hold you sitting still, reading, for several hours. At a time the woman in the book gets scared. I got very scared too, I must admit. The best part is the end, where the bad one in the book turns out to be a good friend like a real Agatha Christie og Connan Doyle book. Morten Barklund, 15. Denmark"
5,A Great First Step to move on with your life,"I picked this book up when I found myself stuck in another bad relationship immediately following my divorce. Joyce wrote this book to catch the attention of women who for one reason or other do not feel good enough about themself to have a good relationship. I would read it while working out, and it really made me think about how I deserved more than what I was giving myself. Two years later I am married to a wonderful man that treats me like gold. This book helped to get me started on a better path in relationship decisions. This is a great book for anyone who keeps finding themselves with creepy, distructive men."
5,Great Pilot,"I'm so happy this was made available for people who don't have BBC America. This was a great show and the Nerdist guys did well on their transition to TV. I think this would even be enjoyable for people who are unfamiliar with the podcast, but it's hard for me to tell because I am a huge fan. I hope more episodes come soon!"
5,Greatness!,"Every single fan of the Nerdist Podcast, Doctor Who, or just comedy in general should watch this goofy geeky show ASAP. Ever wanted to hear what Mick Jagger as Buffalo Bill would sound/look like? Here's your chance!"
3,More scholarly than I expected.,"I thought this would be a nice, easy to understand overview of the profession, but it was a bit dry for me."
1,"Beware: Faucet Adapters are ""Bait and Switch"" Plastic!","The product was meant to replace its predecessor model with faulty faucet adapters. The faucet adapters on this newer model were thought to be made of metal, as clearly shown on the enlarged image. However, these turned out to be made of the same inexpensive plastic material, which made the entire mechanism usable only for a few months."
2,discontinued and beyond the expiration date,"The Seller is selling discontinued items and items that have went beyond their expirationd date without saying anything to the buyer, this should be illegal. this model is dicontinued over a year ago (per pur) and the flavor packets are beyond the expiration date. The flavor packets are no longer available so this feature is useless. Also the packet that came with it tastes horrible, I can only assume because its expiration date is past. I will be returning this model for one that is current in production and can be used."
1,"believe the reviews, this is bad...","falls off easily, does not stay on, progressively gets worsetoo big to wash dishes aroundwater tastes excellent"
1,Don't waste your money like I did!,"I should have believed all of the negative reviews. From the start it restricted the waterflow and progressively got worse until it stopped working altogether - 2 months after I bought it. JUNK!I didn't mind the flavoring though, but I like diet drinks."
1,2400 Flatbed Scanner,"I received the scanner without any software. Without the software, the scanner is absolutely useless. I contacted the seller stating that I did not receive this and have not been contacted by the seller to get the software."
1,Not her best,"Having read a number of her other works, I was suprised about how cynical and angry in tone, this tory is --- not a refreshing read..."
3,An American made Japanese horror movie,"This movie is in the style of current Japanese horror movies, and consists of a series of tales told by psychic as she drives a woman hitchhiker. The production is low-budget, but the stories are entertaining. The movie is in Japanese with English subtitles, and was shot on location - in California! This is most obvious in a cemetery scene - no typical Japanese cemetery looks like that. Most of the actors have typical Japanese names but don't look typically Japanese. More telling is their Japanese: Native Japanese speakers will immediately recognize that these actors do not speak phonetically the Japanese of native speakers, and may be sansei or other asians reasonably fluent in Japanese."
1,Size not as Described,"The description for this product clearly states ""two 54 inch panels"". This is not what was shipped. The package has two 27-inch panels for a total window coverage of 54-inches. I will now have to order a second set to provide the necessary coverage, making these a more expensive option and a bigger hassle!"
5,So so so great!!!,"This is the cutest bike and I absolutely love it! I am a novice bike rider so I don't know what makes a ""super great bike"" BUT if you want something light (to carry up stairs if you are a city dweller like me) and something mega cute and comfy this is it! AND ladies and gentlemen, its CHEAP! So go for it! This bike really really makes me happy!"
5,BEST PUNK BAND EVER!,"This Cd epitomizes the punk album. Milo lives up to his rep once again in this fantastic rant on life and it's many trials and tribulations. If you are ""punk"" you must get this CD!"
4,VERY GOOD REFERENCE,"I cannot wait to start my business. This book gave a world of ideas in how to market my product. It is very relevant to both marketing tangible products, as well as, service. The only shortcoming was the fact that certain issues were pretty outdated. This is to be expected considering the book was published in 1998. On the whole.....[the price of this book]is certainly not too much to spend to increase your sales substantially."
5,Levinson is my hero!,"Long before I was a small business owner, I read and practiced ""Guerilla Marketing"" in the corporate world. Perhaps I owe Jay a small residual for my own success, because his writing amplified my own ""why not"" attitude and I was able to be successful as a leader and marketer. I still use this book after all these years--I'm on my third copy.I recommend this book to all small business owners and employed sales and marketing pros, too. Levinson, like Seth Godin and other marketing gurus, provide the education you cannot find in a classroom. If you have a product or service you want to market to the world, start here."
1,a very strange production,"I guess I am in the group that wonders how the producers got funding for this very strange video. It is a mix of interview snippets, totally unrelated ""music video"" style productions and Anna Netrebko singing excerpts from three operas. There is no question in my mind about the quality of Ms Netrebko's singing -- if you close your eyes and don't watch what is on the screen the experience will be satisfying. The one potentially redeeming feature are some excerpts from live performances. In particular, her extended aria from Rusian and Lyudmila is beautifully costumed and staged. The title of the DVD is very misleading -- this production provides very little information about Anna Netrebko ""the woman"" and only gives us glimpses of ""the voice""."
1,I still need a seal kit.,The product did not work and I received a full refund.thank You.Walter Weeks
2,Upset,"I used this product for the past year, it was awesome! Bought this product online... When it came it was and still is creamy. It's suppose to be thick. Very disappointed."
4,Lots of fun:))),"Oh, when we jump to conclusions and let our emotions rule, we eventually find that we rue the day. Thru quilting, we tend to talk about things we sometimes keep inside. ""The Quilters's Apprentice"" The players see their way to carry on with their lives, and forgive those whom they love."
5,Quilts,I love reading fiction where you learn something. This book has made me start quilting again!
4,Cute story with historical background,"Ok, I don't quilt, I've always wanted to though, and I have to say that this was a really cute story. Decent story line, but what really hooked me, was the way that she weaves so much quilt history and how-to in her story. I'd definitely recommend giving Jennifer Chiaverini's books a try. I'll certainly keep my eyes open for the others that she's written in her Elm Creek series."
5,Great Tool for Leadership Development,"Robert K. Cooper shares meaningful stories and strategies, based upon his work as a neuroscientist and executive coach, that leaders can use immediately. I use his coaching strategies in my day-to-day work with leaders and teams to help them define ""exceptional"" work and strive toward top performance."
5,Practically Magic,"I am delighted to see this book in print -- it is enjoyable, practical, and wise. And, I am confident that it will help you become the person you've always wanted to be."
1,hard to tell if it's on...,"When I got this, the blue power light bearly worked, and now it doesn't work at all. It's very hard to tell if I've turned it on or off unless it's plugged into a music player and a radio is on to the right station."
1,"Good Book, Defective edition","This is a very interesting novel, but I gave it one star because I am rating the edition instead. Lindisfarne Books should be razed by fire and the editors suspended over a slow barbecue. They went to great lengths to provide the book with an arresting cover, interesting typeface for the chapter title, and lively (if uninformed) review notices on the back cover, but were so slipshod in their copy editing that they omitted words from the author's text in the first sentence of the first chapter! I kid you not, this book starts with a phrase, not a sentence! Fortunately it is about living your life over again, so the complete sentence reappears correctly on page 162 at the beginning of chapter 26. But such errors are unacceptable and unforgiveable in an editor, and can lead in time to a loss of the complete text itself, as any classical scholar can tell you, if you can find any these days. Don't buy this edition!"
1,Dull and disappointing,"I tried to like this book. Everyone thinks her garden maintenance book is the be-all, end-all.This book is just dull. The designs are very uninspired and many of the photographs were amateurish and poorly lit. I learned more about garden design from Dianne Benson's fabulous book ""Dirt"" and she had maybe 5 black and white photographs. The plant lists in Disabato-Aust's book are okay, but any number of books list plants by foliage color, flower color etc. This woman uses way too much rudbeckia. Isn't that considered an invasive weed? It should be banned.Ditch this over-priced, over-promoted beast of a book and check out ""Shocking Beauty"" by Thomas Hobbs. This is one of the most beautiful gardening books out there and you'll learn how to use your own eye and instincts to create exquisite and memorable gardens, some of which are simply about foliage and more beautiful than any conventional perennial border."
2,Disappointing,"The author's first book was unique, and provided much needed information unavailable from any other source. It is a much thumbed resource. By contrast, this book is an also-ran in the field of planting design. The photographs are uninspiring, the text too general and vaque, and some of the information in the tables on plant requirements is just plain wrong and contradicts advice from the RHS in Wisley. As a consequence, the authors image is damaged and that is a great shame!"
4,Page Turner,"I found Ironhelm to be a book that was extermely hard to put down. Right from the start it immerses you in action and adventure. The main plot was easy to guess, as this novel seemed to be based on the Spanish invasion of Mexico. Historical boredom is spared, however, with the lively infusion of magic and fantasy. Although true to the Forgotten Realms setting, it adds a new and original continent. My only complaint is the brief details in some parts of this book. This lack, however, keeps the book fast paced."
4,Excellent portable clothes rack.,"Took almost two weeks to arrive, but worth the wait. Fit perfectly into our closet and great storage potential. Directions not very good, but what do you expect these days with everything being built in China. Would buy again."
4,it makes sense,The On-purpose Person: Making your life make sense. Makes sense! Really. Once in a while it is good to stop and learn more about one self and in which direction you want to go from here. This book can help on the way. But the decision would always be yours.
5,Must read,"This is an easy read but a very powerful one. If you are struggling to find your way, asking yourself, ""Why am I here"" or just looking to grow as a person this is a great little book. I have read it more than once and it has helped give me a different outlook and direction every time."
4,"Easy to read, difficult to live","I read this book as a free kindle offer. I gobbled it up in what felt like a moment. The story is pretty simple, and the concepts are pretty easy to understand - so easy that they might slip by as unimportant details.Since reading it, I've joined Kevin's online network and talked to him on more than one occation about my process in finding my purpose. I've had to go back and reread passages from the book, finding each time that there was something I had missed or forgotten. It's an interesting journey, and there are people willing to help me along the way, so to me, it's a win."
5,Powerful prescription for an abundant life,"If just 10% of the population followed the steps in this book and crafted a clear compelling purpose for thier lives, the impact would be tremendous. This easy to read personal leadership fable inspired me to see the unrealized potential that lay dormant in my life without a written, deeply thought-out purpose. I plan to give a copy to my wife, each of my children, and my key employees. Great stuff!"
1,Don't Make My Mistake!,"The editorial of this book is inadequate. It should say in bold: ""This book has LOTS of blank pages for you to use.""If you are looking for a book on HOW to journal this is *NOT* the product you want. This book is just as it says:A journal (i.e. lots of BLANK pages for $11+ dollars!)If you are wanting a book on how to journal buy her other book... ""Keeping a Nature Journal: Discover a Whole New Way of Seeing the World Around You"""
1,Mics don't pick up at listed distance,"I bought this phone to hold weekly conference calls with staff members who were out of town using the bluetooth feature to attach to cell phone since our meetings were always in different places, some without phone jacks. While it was a great idea, those on the call could never hear us at the table! We always worked at a table no longer than 8 feet, so the furtherest anyone was away from the phone was 4 feet and callers couldn't hear us. We could hear them great at the table, but for over $300, I expect a product that works and lives up to its product description. Frankly, we could hear each other using our speakerphones on our cell phones better. I'm going to return because it wasn't worth the price and did not do what it advertised."
4,Informative and Interesting,"I bought this book because I am interested in nutrition - there are so many books on the market but I wanted one that was not trying to sell me a particular diet plan. I try to follow Paleo personally because it fits into my lifestyle and I believe it does provide a good argument into the hunter gatherer physiology. That being said, I just want to be a healthy women and this book and given me 'food for thought' to adapt my paleo lifestyle and eat some foods that are not strictly Paleo.You can get too much information at times - I am not medically trained and I did re-read a few chapters but it was not beyond my understanding once I had taken the time to absorb the information. I will look at other books written by the same author for my next healthy read."
3,One way to learn to Count - J. Smith Pima Community College,"One hungry cat is a fun book that would really inspire children to learn to count, it has a great theme on learning to share and equally divide things up. I can think of several manipulatives that could be used to get this lesson across. This book inspires creative thinking in using various manipulatives. This is a great 1st and 2nd grade book to use for helping children in counting."
4,A useful product,"Good ideas here. I think I liked the Archetypes CDs better, but this one has a lot of useful information in it, and Ms. Nani's engaging plaint-talk style too. I recommend it for those who are exploring their lives and purpose."
4,Amillenialism Described Well,A classic and influential statement of the reformed / amillennial view of the kingdom. Well-argued and concise; but for me not ultimately convincing.
1,review of biomedical engineering handbook,"subjects are old and out of date. For example, modeling of the eye, (...). This books seems like an attempt to introduce you to the research of a few professors who are trying to recruit graduate students. I found little educational value in it."
5,Great omelet pan,I love this pan. I bought one for my husband and I and then bought a second one to be able to make more at a time when we have overnight guests. I like to saute the veggies first and then add the egg. Very yummy and comes out looking great! Easy clean up. A must if you are an omelet lover!
1,Gives off a toxic odor,"I cannot overemphasize the toxic oder this pan gives off, filling the house with the obnoxious fumes for hours. Because it's not stainless steel, whatever it is made of is just horrible. It sort of smells like the non-stick coating being burned, but it's the outside of the pan, not the inside.I tried this three times thinking the odor would wear off, and it didn't. It just went in the trash. It worked well as an omelette pan, but now I'm going to get a small stainless steel pan that will do the same thing (probably without a flip function, but I'll live without it).Buyer beware."
1,not what i expected,"I had this pan for about 9 mouths now well this morning i threw it in the trash... ITs make a mess, the eggs stick to both sides dosn't matter if you use spray... Tired of cleaning my glass cook top just to cook two eggs... Went to wally world and got a small pan for 5bucks and change. Now i can cook two eggs with ease.... I bought this pan even after i read the negavites..I'll pay a lot more attention the next time"
2,it WAS good,"it is difficult to rate this product since 2 things matters , 1- concept 2- qualityI love the concept . makes every thing so delicious and everything looks beautiful like a chef has made the omelet . you don't have to put lots of oil . I was very careful to no to scratch its Teflon and I was using wooden or Teflon spoons and still I don't see any scratch or dent . but for some reason it doesn't work !I think I have used it for 10-12 times and now I think even if I boil some water in it ,it gonna stick .so I am still looking for double side pan but for sure not this one.by the way the size was perfect for a girl stomach :)"
4,Cute omelette pan,"I would give this Jo!e omelette pan 5*'s if it were a little bigger just to let readers know not to expect a bigger size. This little omelette pan does the trick for me --- a challenged omelette maker. Finally, I can flip and make a nice-looking puffy edible omelette. It holds 2 beaten eggs but might leak a little when you flip the pan if you add onions, peppers & cheese like I do."
3,"nice little pan,",and i mean little. wouldn't have ordered it if i knew if you barely hold 2 plain eggs no fillings. it does work well though
1,It was nothing like the reviews said ti was,"Well, after reading the previous book, I really thought maybe this book would be in a somewhat good condition. And it was. But when I opened the book. It was not what I expected. I saw writing EVERYWHERE in the book practically. This really upsetted me. I'm wondering if I can return it. This most certain was not worth even the money I paid for."
3,Uhm....,"I really only gave this album three stars because Good Morning Joan was awesome. But honestly, there was only one other good track on the album, I need some fine wine and you, you need to be nicer. Which honestly needed a different title."
2,"Brief, Boring, and Overpriced","While this work is trying to be a historical account of real ninjutsu practitioners, it's ultimately disappointing due to its slim size and extremely dry prose style. I'm not sure how you produce a dull book on such an exciting subject, but this one belongs in a school library of the 1970s. I refuse to believe it was really copyrighted in 2003 unless that was a renewal."
4,Decent book,"Good introduction for the concepts and tasks for building a MDM, at the time it was published.The MDM presented is more of a source-to-target kind of MDM, and less of a codeset MDM. For reference-based systems such as warehouses, codesets are used a lot more, which does not fit too well in this kind of design. The project management steps were good in that it provides a starting point for discussions.The design works well in most business situations, except for decision-based systems, which contain variable and calculation information.Would have been very helpful if there were conceptual and logical models as well as a physical data model. The DDL was incorrect (duplicates in foreign keys), but it is forgiveable. Overall, presents a lot of information to think about."
5,Zune charger,Great little device for when I don't have a computer or a usb plug so I can charge the zune. It has a little red light on it that makes it very bright.
1,You get what you pay for,This product was very inexpensive and shows you get what you pay for. The product does not work and we tossed it in the garbage. It wasn't worth the time or expense to send it back. Would not recommend.
3,Stress Management Therapy DVD,"I rented this dvd from my library & only skimmed the 35 min content. It seems created in Germany (201) but it does have the DVD warnings & alternate selection for spoken English. Many times her mouth is moving but there is only soothing music playing & quick instruction in English, so I wonder how much I'm missing.Set out in a field, Michaela Roberson, ""a designated expert for meditation & relaxation..."" leads two other women in their 20s-40s in comfortable clothing for warm-up using Qi gong (turning of the waist) & Tai Chi moves (grasp bird's tail, etc.) & the rest using modified yoga poses like tree, seated twist, a very modified warrior 1, etc. Though Roberson does the Tai Chi moves overall correctly, the two other women did not which bothered me especially when the camera would focus on one of them sometimes.Since I only skimmed this, I gave it 3 stars as it could be good for some people possibly."
2,Parental Alert!!!,Sahara SpecialBook was a good read but was horrified that the author would use profanity in a book recommended for children ages 8 and up.
3,Sahara Special is a good book!,How would you feel if your dad left you to live with your mom in an apartment? Well that's how Sahara feels. Sahara Special by Esme Raji Codell is an ok book. It has a lot of details and interesting events. But some parts I didn't like that were just plain weird. Girls would probably like some parts of the book but not all.Sahara is a quiet girl that doesn't do her work so she has to take 5th grade all over again. Miss Pointy is Sahara's new teacher. She is very weird and has pointy toes and pointy nose. The setting takes place in Sahara's 5th grade class with her new 5th grade teacher and students. The problem is that Sahara has to do 5th grade again and is in a special needs class.I personally don't really like this book because some parts don't make sense or don't have to be in there. Some parts I did like and I would recommend this book to be for pre-teens or teens because of bad language. You should read Sahara Special by Esme Raji Codell.
2,Not Satisfied,"I was very disappointed by this DVD. I found Seane's tone of voice and manner of speaking to be jarring and abrasive. Even though her lectures emphasize the spiritual elements of yoga, I feel that her practice is extremely focused on the physical. I found that even when I was in a flow of one breath per movement, she was still going too quickly for my taste. I felt like I had to take short, shallow breaths to keep up with her! She has a ""yoga boot-camp"" vibe that doesn't appeal to me. I much prefer Shiva Rea's Shakti DVD."
3,Examine the Tools!,"I had the wrenches for a while before I needed one particular size. I took it out and turned it over and discovered that it had obvious, multiple casting defects. I then removed all of the wrenches and discovered another with similar, obvious, multiple casting defects. I have had nothing but great experiences with Amazon in the past, and I'm sure that Amazon was not aware of the defects...but since the defects so pronounced and facing the back of the package, I'll bet that Amazon's supplier knew that the defects were there. It's too late for me to do anything...that's my bad. But examine this product as soon as you receive it, so that you don't miss your chance to give a defective product a return trip back to Mexico."
3,Belt Description,"Description states that belt is for 42"" and 44"" decks. It is also the belt for my 48"" deck on my 2004 Craftsman DYT."
3,OK book. Didnt help like i thought it would.,I was struggling greatly with my Chem class. Going through this book was a different way of looking at Chemistry. I realized i already knew all the ideas this book was presenting. Didnt really help me like i had thought it would.
3,I still need some help.,"Please count me as an ""idiot"", because this book helped me a little bit, but rushed through some concepts. I'm currently in it and I'll give you some examples.First, the hokey jokey stuff gets tiring to me. I do like analogies, but the jokes are a waste of time.Second, the first few chapters are very easy and then, in chapter 5, they ask you to figure quantum orbitals, I think. And then they go into Electron configurations by telling you this element is in the ""s"" region and they don't show you where the ""s"" region is on the periodic table is.He eases you in with a bunch of jokes and then spills acid on you. Not fun.I need more description and less silly jokes"
5,The Magic School Bus Meets the Rot Squad,"Another in the series of successful ""Magic School Bus"" books for young elementary-age children, The MSB Meets the Rot Squad is a helpful addition to any teacher's library. It can enhance units dealing with the life cycle in a way that isn't simply approached in other texts for this age group. It really helps jump-start the learning process and bring this concept to life."
4,Good for when you need it print.,"I do a lot of emergency communications. There were time when the only way to get something in the field in print was to hand write it out. Not any more. Since this is small it can travel in my ""go bag"". Since it needs no ink there is no mess.The only drawback is it will not print a regular size sheet (8.5x11.)"
2,"Uses tiny, specialized paper you would never normally use.","This thing does not print full size pages. It prints these tiny little sheets that arent good for much.Its connections to a computer are massively outdated, like from the 90's or maybe even the 80's. You would probably have to be a tech expert to even get it runningJust bite the bullet and get a Brother Laser printer. Laser printers are fairly low maintenance and the toner doesn't cost a fortune like inkjets do."
4,India Airplane Model,"Great Demonstration of Aero-Mechanical Engineering Branch in this Model. My Son was eager for first-hand experience of this aeroplane. For me, the model is situated on TV.1/72 P51D Assemb-India '45, Easy Model"
4,Good work,"The main thing that I liked about this book wasn't necessarily the plot or anything else, it was the historical part. Often this time period (early 1900s) is romanticized. In this book the truth about the time is told with the nitty-gritty details, but the author keeps some of the romance about the time in it. Also I think that the thoughts of Mattie are what I would have wondered about. Like why all the female writers never married and if they did it wasn't happy. Those things made this book good and an enjoyable read. Some younger people that try to read this book may have problems at first trying to follow the story because the plot skips back and forth."
5,Wow!,"I loved this book!!! It was a little boring in the begining , but after that it got really good!!! iI would really recommend this for someone who loves a murder mystery with romanance!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,"Most difficult review on earth! I mean, they're BATTERIES . . .","Unless one of the reviewers here is working for Consumer Reports, I would regard any high-starred reviews for this product with a bit of suspicion. First off, these batteries worked fine, but I didn't do a time vs. use comparison for them, then another battery type, etc. They're batteries, people. Near as I can tell, they seem to do a solid job in Wii controllers and TV remotes. If the price is right, I'd say grab 'em."
5,Longer Lasting Batteries at an Affordable Price,"Panasonic's digital power batteries hold their power and have a much longer life than when I attempt to use traditional alkaline batteries for my audio and visual needs, particularly with my digital camera. The 8-pack has outlasted similar packages of AA alkaline batteries I've used in the past, and at a more affordable price than similar lithium batteries.Panasonic claims that the battery uses high purity compounds to create a better battery. While I cannot speak to the makeup of the battery, I can say that I've been pleased with the performance of the batteries."
3,Overpriced Batteries,"There isn't much to say about batteries aside from whether they work or they don't.I don't keep enough logs to know how often I'm using these for the purposes I put them to (XBox Controller Batteries, TV Remotes, etc) but they appear to function as intended.To be honest though these batteries seem a bit overpriced for what I'd normally pay. For $9.28 (what they're at right now) I'd think I should get a few more since other vendors ask about that for 16 batteries. Unless this dropped to around $6 I wouldn't even consider it and that still seems like a lot for what you're getting.I'd avoid this and go for a better value."
5,"Meet specs, final verdict still years away","Executive summary: I've had a sudden spat of leaky batteries. Maybe Panasonic can do better.The leaky batteries include ones that came with a Gerber flashlight and were rebranded as Gerber. More disturbingly, two different sets of Duracell. One set was in a wall clock, the other in a cordless mouse. Duracell is OK about replacing things, but also was patronizing by implying that the leakage was due to trying to recharge the ruined mouse. I've been fairly loyal to Duracell for about 20 years, but am finding myself open to try other brands.It's hard to review batteries. These are the right size, the right voltage, and haven't leaked. The other ones, the ones that leaked, sat around for years before they failed. Time will tell.Five stars (for now) because the batteries are doing exactly what they are supposed to do. One little drip from any of them though..."
3,"Less kickbox, More agility/light strength","I have to agree with some reviewers that there is minimal kickbox and more emphasis on toning to encourage a heart rate. While the Legs/Buns, and Upper Body portions use kickbox moves, the other areas less so. I use this as part of a circuit with weight training since it's broken into timed sequences and I dont have to think about keeping time. Overall though, I would consider it a thorough workout due to its coverage of all body parts."
3,This one is difficult with NO alternative moves!,"This video has some good exercises, but it also has some real killers. It's like you're in bootcamp for real! What really annoys me is that in the 10 Minute videos, the instructor is alone. That means that there are no alternative moves shown for any of the exercises. At one point in this video, you have to jump to your feet from a horizonal postion on the floor, in one move. And if you can't do it, you're out of luck. I'm giving this one to the Salvation Army."
2,Very Disappointing,"I am a huge fan of kickboxing and I was very excited to try this DVD out. However, it was nothing like what I expected. I do not consider it kickboxing at all. Furthermore, the moves are unnecessarily complicated. Some of them seem a bit dangerous even. It is a moderate workout, but not fun and certainly not kickboxing."
4,fun workout,I love the 10 minute sections. You can pick and choose or do the whole thing. It is fun and you work up a good sweat.
5,To Touch Evolution,"This book gives an intimate insight into the chimpanzee community that Goodall so entwined her life with. As readers we follow the real-life dramas of birth, death, learning, war and love. It basically a sequel to the book In The Shadow of Man . In Goodall creates portraits of several of the key chimpanzees , following their struggles for power and a place in the community. She focuses on key relationships between the chimpanzees, including between mothers and daughters and sons and fathers.A good portion of the book is taken up with the importance of preserving areas for chimpanzees in the wild. Goodall writes that we should all feel shame and horror at human exploitation of our closes cousins."
2,"Great band, poor audio quality.","I am a Marshall Tucker Band fan. I bought most of their albums when they were introduced and have purchased much duplicate music on CD's in recent years. I gave this concert disk set 2 stars because of the poor audio quality. Unfortunately the audio quality of the Carolina Dreams Tour '77 disk set is significantly less than that of the audio CD's containing the band's studio recordings from that era. I own a nice audio system and I appreciate good quality sound. If you have a similar opinion regarding audio quality, you will be disappointed with the disk set."
4,Great Quality,Pros:It is easy to setupGood QualityGreat BassCons:I had to pay shipping and tax one or theother is fine with me but something about both pisses me offRear channel speaker wire is too short my room is only 10x12Wish it had more optical inputsOther:Friggin Fedex left the box outside it was like 5 degrees out and I dont live in a neighborhood were I'd like everyone knowing what i have
1,Horrible Service Record Don't buy these!!! Bolt fast!!,"These are absolutely great speakers.......unless you have a problem. I spent hours with their tech help online trying to figure out what was wrong, they finally shipped me a new part (the console) which didn't fix the problem. I took them over to Best Buy willing to pay whatever it took to get them fixed. They were ready to go until they found out that Logitech would not allow them to fix the problem and since I was now past the warranty period, Logitech wouldn't take the speakers for repair either. I had called many electronic and computer repair places who mentioned they got no support from Logitech so couldn't repair the speakers. I ended up giving them to Best Buy to have him recycle them.Ridiculously Bad and stupid. DON'T even think about buying them. Logitech is no Nordstrom. They're the extreme opposite."
5,Extremely pleased,I replaced a Creative ProGamer (G550 I think) set of 5.1 speakers with these speakers to gain an optical input. As soon as hooked them up I was delighted with the sound quality. I'm also hoping that an R/F modulator that is being delivered will allow me to hook my XBox 360 into the coaxial input. My new definition of heaven is to play the Freddie Cole station on Pandora through these speakers.
2,Ripped off,"I bought this thinking 505 watts...hot damn right? No, I also owned a Z-2300 (200 watts) and that is almost as loud as something that has 253% more watts. When I say almost I mean if a scale is 1-10, 10 being the Z-5500 then the Z-2300 must be a 9. It cost 200 dollars more than its predecessor yet an insignificant increase...I'm ticked off so bad right now. The plus side to this a remote control, which looks like cheap plastic crap that probably the battery cost more than the remote itself.P.S. Yes I enabled 5.1 surround on vista and its still not making my ears bleed like I wish it would."
2,VERY LOUD HUM,"Bought this product and received it in 2 days. Hooked it up to my pc's soundcard, only to get a loud hum from the system. When the control pod is attached to the subwoofer i get a loud hum, when detached, nothing. I get no sound in optical, or coax when hooked up to my dvd player. This product cost me $400, and I did not receive my money's worth. Also, you can not return it to Amazon. I'm going to call Logitech, and see if they can help me. I can't give a more in depth review til I hear it working correctly. Maybe I received a reject. I'm about to find out."
4,These speakers rock! (ed: I now would give 'em 5 stars),"I purchased this system to get surround sound for gaming, and it sure sounds nice. As the other reviews have noted, the sub is massive. The quality seems good too. I'm sure they will be great for DVDs and stuff. I just used the analog inputs, but it has optical and wired digital inputs too. The only ding I have is that the speaker wire is attached to the speakers, and is not removable. If you need some good speakers for gaming, I can recommend these.(Oh, it'd be nice if they made some accessory stands for the satellites.)Ed: 11/23/04Now that I've had the system running for a bit over a week, I would have given the system 5 stars instead of the 4 that I have it. It's great for MP3s, games, DVDs... any form of audio. As for the speaker wires being integrated into the speakers, that's just not a big deal, since you can always purchase an extension or two.Ed: 03/15/07Still love 'em."
3,Digital inputs don't work,"The optical input does not work well. I get a buzzing/humming noise when using optical cables. No, it is not the cable, as it works fine with my other sound system. I'm currently working with Logitech tech support, but they are really slow and don't seem to know any more than I do about my sound equipment. Anyways, I'm stuck with using the analog inputs which work fine--I guess. Digital surround sound sounds better, but I usually forget about it while i'm watching a movie.***EDIT: I sent it back to the factory and got a new one, works fine now."
4,Logitech Z-5500,This system is great good bass. And clear dynamic range speakers. Just wish I could connect it directly to my TV.
2,"Come on , you are paying $300 for PC Speakers ? Get Real People!","Not sure why so much hype about this Speakers ?. I heard them many times and price did not convince me to pay $300 for these PC Speakers. If it is Bose, I understand but for 'logitech' brand, i thought I must be out of my mind, if I decide to purchase these. All I heard was thumpy bass and no mid or highs clearly.Many THX home theater speakers you can get at this price. Not worth more than $99."
2,Not Sure About the Product Yet - But AMAZON is SLOW,"Despite the ordering screen clearly stating ""Usually ships within 1 to 2 days"" I am STILL waiting for shipment. Currently seeing a 11-13 DAY out ""estimated ship date"" on my account screen. I'll review the product if/when it arrives - but I'd recommend that others buy this product elsewhere as there are clearly ""issues"" with order processing / delivery."
2,"Excellent sound, Bad design","As most anyone will tell you, these speakers do have excellent sound and if you're just going to set them up on your desktop, then I'd give them 5 stars. However, the design for wall mounting these is horrible and you can't ceiling-mount them. Logitech does not make separate mounts for these and no ""universal speaker mounts"" will work with them. If you want to see how they mount, go to Logitech's website, go to product support and enter wall mounting. Some might argue that they're computer speakers, not home entertainment center speakers, but for $300, I expect a little bit better design."
1,Logitech's Poor Return Policy,"Pros: Great speakers, just like everyone else says.Cons: My experience: One of the satellite speakers was constantly buzzing. Logitech only option for me was to return the ENTIRE system. I did that after reluctantly paying the shipping cost. My replacement set was not function normal either. The control center applied a high pitch hum to all audio from digital sources. Again, Logitech only option was to return the ENTIRE system, and have me pay shipping again. I opted for a refund instead of a second replacement because I was already short some $70 for shipping costs!I loved these speakers. They sounded great when I had them. It would be no big deal if they freely replaced them, but making me pay the heavy shipping cost twice is ridiculous. What were the chances of me receiving two defective units in a row? Much greater than me buying another product from Logitech."
5,Logitech Z-5500 THX-Certified 505-Watt 5.1 Digital Surround Sound Speaker System,"the system is amazing! easy to set up! the bass is incredible, it shake the pictures off the wall.Logitech Z-5500 THX-Certified 505-Watt 5.1 Digital Surround Sound Speaker System"
5,a must buy,"I bought these to go with a new Intel I7 build. All i can say is they are fantastic! Not only did Amazon beat out other online retailers but up to more than 100 dollars cheaper but it arrived in less then 48 hours with no problems. Great speakers, great company....if you want serious stereo sound then look no further"
1,control center breaks after two years,If you don't mind having to replace the speakers after 2 years they're good speakers. The control box breaks and it can't be replaced. Even tech support said it's a very common problem. The only thing you can do is buy another set set of speakers. They will offer you 50% off. How nice of them seeing as it's a common problem that can't be fixed after only two years of very little use.
5,quality speakers,"these speakers are very loud and have great sound quality. I I was not disappointed. compatable with many things. great buy, great price."
4,Awesome Speakers,"I was searching for good digital speakers for my new rig and came across this model which was raved about by users across multiple websites. So after spending quite a while convincing myself that these were the speakers that I should be going in for, I finally took the plunge. Trust me when I say this, I AM NOT DISAPPOINTED. These speakers are way more than just a bang for the buck. They are high quality, premium surround sound equipment and will lighten up any living room to the pedestal of a home theater system. Great going Logitech !"
4,"Excellent, clean sound.","I've owned this sound system for a few months now and am thoroughly satisfied with it. The sound is clean (distortion free), especially in the lower frequencies. The massive subwoofer produces just the right amount of deep bass sounds without being overwhelming, much less causing distortion.I listen to classical music and Barbershop harmony, occasionally ""Big Band"" music. The Logitech Z-5500 handles all ranges very well.The separate sound control unit is a bit cumbersome and takes up space; however, the remote control which comes with it. compensates for the slight inconvenience.The system sounds great, I recommend it and the price is not bad at all.William StaubachRotonda West, FL"
4,works good/good price,works great its got a sleek black look.I can stick it in my pocket and go next door and it still works and thats like 150-200 feet thats good.great price too!!
4,Return of the Dancing Master,This book presents an interesting case of police investigation by a police officer (not Wallander) with cancer of the tongue. This officer responds to the murder of a former colleage and becomes involved in the murder investigation. The book is thoughtful and introspective - but keeps you reading to the end.
3,THE RETURN OF THE DANCING MASTER,"It was okay but I had a hard time with the story. I wasn't as crazy about it like I was the Kurt Wallander Series. Had a hard time following the jest f the story. Wasn't my""cup of tea"". The politics in the story was good and acurate for the time period but the rest wasn't appealing to me. Others may like it, I didn't."
1,BattleTech fans beware!,"After slogging through the book with its rather mediocre writing, I perosanlly found the ending both unbelievable and unsatisfying. After walking across the room to pick up the book (where I had hurled it with great force moments before) I reread it hoping I had been wrong. Nope. It was still a poor ending. I had expected some grand battle to finish off the story, but not one in which all major characters (both good guys and bad guys) all walk away. All right, one was horribly burned. But no one paid that ultimate price for freedom (or in payment for some rather terrible crimes talked about (but rarely shown) in the novel). Kenson should stick to ShadowRun."
4,I love it but it attracts dirt like a magnet.,"It keeps my chain flexible and quiet. However, it is a bit sticky and attracts dirt so cleaning your chain more frequently is necessary."
3,Size was one size too small,"As another reviewer commented, these shoes are smaller than stated. I wear a 13 and the shoe barely fit on my foot. It was more like a 12. Too bad because otherwise it seems like a nice shoe."
5,Best Book for Character Analysis!,"Heaven Knows What, by Grant Lewi is one of the astrology classics that anyone can understand the basic essentials of character analysis through. He was a genius, and gives the best insight of any book I've read. You can get your basic data (signs and degrees) from sites like [...], and then run to Grant Lewi's book for great interpretation of that data."
3,A very mixed bag..,"Wow, some of the games on this CD are REALLY old 8 bit games. They are fun for about 20-30 seconds, then your eyes start hurting and you need to stop playing. Fortunately, there are other games on this CD that are worth your time; alot of side-scrolling, SuperMario-like games."
1,not as advertised,"this was just a piece of felt with a cardboard tube, there is no padded mat just a large peice of green felt."
3,You Can Find Gold With a Metal Detector,Prospecting information is presented that is useful and informative
3,James Bond meets Conan,"Like the previous reviewer, I bought the complete set and am starting from Book 1. The material is formulaic at best. While reading you can see that Blade will in the following adventures meet x number of beautiful women and engage in sex with every one of them. The books are great timewasters for a late evening or early weekend morning."
3,Keel the Consummate Credulist,"This book is a reissue of ""Strange Creatures from Time and Space"" that came out in the 70's. Keel is an ardent credultist--he culls his ""facts"" from unreliable sources like Fate Magazine, hearsay, and the worst kind of anecdotal ""evidence"". Many of his reports have turned out to be hoaxes; the rest are just anecdotes, as I said (many of his his ""mysterious beings"" come from reports from many years ago, when journalism wasn't as accountable as it is today--isn't it funny that as science and fact-checking has become more accomplished, these kinds of sightings have virtually disappeared?).All this would be fine if Keel didn't continually position himself as a serious journalist. If you want a fun read about scary monsters, definitely buy this book--Keel is a very entertaining writer. But just remember to keep your tongue firmly in your cheek!"
2,This pretty much sucked my gills.,And not in that good way. The whole thing feels rushed--as if in anticipatiion of the potential onslaught of interested buyers generated from The Mothman Prophecies movie. Our Haunted Planet I liked. It's only semi-fruity. This one is a gill sucker.
3,Great exampls of what parents should do.,"This book is good and offers enormous examples of what the average person see's day-to-day, does day-to-day, with child hitting. This book takes those situations, alters them, and out comes a positive resolution. Really, simple as that - not hard to read - or do. If your becoming a parent I highly suggest to invest in this book, just get a used one, skim through it and I guarantee you'll walk away with a little wisdom in your heart.Child hitting is never necessary. This book will soon evoke this broad mindset of a dominant-yet respectful-parent where you'll never have to stress over a situation and deal with such a negative consequences that may be long-term.Buy the book already."
1,Not a Christian book,"Found this book on a Christian website, but it turns out it really isn't.The author connects spanking in childhood to sexual pleasure in adulthood. It really isn't what I was looking for."
5,A VERY good read!,"Great character development, moments of poignancy and humor, great food, believable and realistic dialogue and detailed description -- all that I could want in a novel. I don't know what reviewer ""Biggs"" has problems with but I can assume that his wife has never experienced the epitome of female release. Maybe he's a true ""missionary."" I'd ignore that guy if I were a prospective reader. LURAY is a truly memorable novel...for all the right reasons."
3,"good book, but designed for teenagers","I purchased this book for myself...I am 37 years old. What I didn't realize until I bought the book is that it is a book written for teenagers. It is a good book, but not for a grown adult. I wished they would have specified that more in the description."
4,Perfectionism,"This book is a good starting point for understanding the general forces behind a perfectionist's makeup. You can use this book to identify characteristics, then narrow your research more specifically to suit your interests or queries; yet it is also detailed enough to be the only book one reads if you only want general knowledge of this personality type."
5,Excellent,"Great condition, got to me in just a couple of day. My son is reading it for a class, so I didn't want to go out and buy a new one."
4,Practical advice I can use immediately.,Excellent models of all kinds of everyday documents and clear guidelines on how to write them. I can use this information immediately. Good examples of what to avoid. Even has a section on e-mail.
2,Review of Estee Perfume by Estee Lauder,I was disappointed that they didn't have the size I have which is bigger than 1.0 ounce. Then I paid extra to get it there by Dec. 21 and my sister didn't get it until after Christmas.
4,shaft is still the man,All 3 shaft movies were great if you like movies from the 1970's. They don't make movies like this any more about urban life.
1,RENT SOMETHING ELSE!!!!,"I have to disagree with the previous reviews because for me this film was a waste of money esp since it cost 3.99 rather than 2.99 like most of the other older movies. While viewing this film I almost stopped it several times to watch something else, but decided that since I had already purchased it I may as well sufffer throught it. It was just plain lame and the special effects were awful. My recommendation is that if you are looking for a good vampire movie KEEP LOOKING!!"
1,Don't Waste your time,"Have you read this book? Don't. It, (in my own opinion) is the most annoying book I have ever read. It holds no suspense whatsoever and the characters are a bunch of drips. This book is confusing and as weird as Cusick's middle name. This is just my opinion of course. However, if you are looking for an author that can actually write suspense novels, I suggest you get into Joan Lowery Nixon, Diane Hoh, or A.Bates. Believe me people, this book is an absolute flop. Cusick is an okay author, but this book must be the lowest point of her entire career. Don't waste your time."
3,A good read,"I really enjoyed the book for the most part, the first two sections were very good. The detail that the author goes into describing the horrors of domestic abuse is rather chilling. However I was disappointed with the third part. It almost seemed like the author was trying to finish the book and just end it. I was actually left with more questions about the railroad and how an organization like this would function. The first two parts though were very enjoyable."
4,GOOD BOOK ON ADOBE CAMERA RAW,This book is suitable to everybody. It explains all about camera raw with basics words and take care to explain the best WORKFLOW to use for a photographer in order to avoid confusion and than to obtain best results.I like this book and I have learned a lot.I recommend it especially for those who are inexperienced.Good read to everybody.Sergio ContiItaly.
5,The Girls have done it again,"The girls of Tlc have done it again, another dope track with a new type of sound each time it get's better and better. Lovin the futurisitic funk."
1,Forget it,"I couldn't believe my eyes. Anyway it is not easy to write 212 pages about one of the most astonishing business and made it completely uninteresting. What we got? A couple of ""wonderful ideas"" like ""put words ""save money"" in subject of your e-mail"". There are hundreds of long known ideas like ""acquaire technology"" or ""be open to future possibilities"". But not the word about the Amazon phenomenon.And what about Amazon? Nothing. The author who even didn't talk to the founder of Amazon? Impossible? Yes, it is possible in this book. So, if you want to know something about Amazon go somewhere else."
1,Please don't waste your money,I was very disappointed to read the book. In fact I kept it down after the first chapter. Thankfully I had borowwed it from the library and not bought it. Please save your money for something else. Or give it away to the Salvation army. At least some good might come out of it.
3,Good bibliography. Interesting,The information is repetative. Interesting insight into e-commerce in first few chapters. Bibliography is good and some box-items are well written.
1,Nothing Here,This is one of the worst books I've read in quite some time. Fortunately I only lost a few dollars on it. There is very little of value in this book.
2,Little action,"The storyline moved along so slowly that I almost put the book down. There isn't a mystery or body until more than 1/3 into the book. By then, I almost didn't care! It is mostly a character study of the main character, but isn't very engrossing. Not a hit with me."
4,down to earth,i injoyed its plot. not a lot of shoot'm up. has a lot of family value's for the old and young
2,a simple sketch,"As an artist I see this movie as a simple sketch. A movie with undeveloped characters and script. The photography and color is beautiful and especially accurate of the western USA on the positive side. This movie appears to have taken snips of ideas from more sucessful movies, such as ""Secondhand Lions."" This could have been, as so many movies, a good movie because the actors and acting are top rate, but they didn't have much to work with. Wait until the price comes down. (If you think this is an inadequate review, you will now understand how this movie will make you feel.)"
3,Rebuilders Guide- lot of good principles,This book has a lot of good basic truths and principles but there is a lot of legalism intermixed with the truth. One needs to be careful to sort out the differences. Overall it is a good reference guide.
3,Not very durable,"I went through 2 of these before I finally just went with the flat wide leash. My dog likes to chase squirrels up trees and the leash would get caught on the bark, within 2 weeks the leash had already started to tear. I returned it for a new one, making sure this time I would be more careful about her catching things with it, but again it did the same thing. I finally went with the flat wide retractable leash and it is much much better, we have had it for 2 months now and no signs what so ever of tearing. This model itself is light and fast retracting with a great easy to use stop button on it. I could attach it to my bag and go hands free with assistance of a carabiner. If your dog doesn't wrap around or catch things with their leash I do recommend this product!"
4,Good Study book,"I have not finished reading this book. It takes a long time to finish such a small book. Take your time with it, don't rush through it and you will get a lot from it. It is one you can use over and over again, year after year."
3,Gundam Wing RD (Reader's Digest),"First off, this 3-part manga series is very different than the anime. Lots of stuff was cut out, some stuff was changed around, and some new stuff was added altogether. Call it ""Gundam Wing Lite"", if you will. The artwork is pretty good, the parody comics in the back were kind of funny, and Duo's suggestion on how to get Trowa's memories back made me burst out loud laughing (maybe because it was perfectly in character) but I cannot recommend this series. The artwork saves these books from being rated 2-stars. If you want the full experience, check out the series on DVD, then the Endless Waltz movie and the Ground Zero, Blind Target, and Episode Zero comics. But it's safe to skip these books."
5,Great,"This cd is great, that's all there is to it. Every song is great, and that makes the whole cd great. They are also great in concert!"
5,Great CD,well i would have to say that the best thing about this cd is the shark attack part where they are talking about dinner! That is great it is just funny! but the whole Cd is good!
2,Wited one week for a diappearing packabe,"I antiiiiicipated it within 3-5 day sn we vever receiceved it. It as sor decorations for my grandson's birthday caaaaaaake. I would do shopping for them myslef, bu I recently suffered a stroke and cannot get out to do this shopping. Now I haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaav no deor fo th caaaaake which will hit tht table on August 3."
3,Good advice but plodding,"I disagree with some of the other reviewers who say that the book is a good read. I felt that I didn't know where the book was going a lot of the time. When all was said and done, I was glad to be finished (sometimes I really had to push myself to keep going), but I did learn a lot about change management."
4,Good deal on used book,"Shipped very fast, exactly as pictured/promised. A+. Bought all these books for a friend for Christmas and they were in good to fine condition and he was happy with them"
5,"There is ""Esperanza"" for music after all","I'll admit: I'm biased against current rock music, as much of it is generic waste. But Manu Chao is an outstanding original. The elusive Mr. Chao, former Manu Negra frontman, is a brashly inventive wellspring of talent, churning out quirky, catchy, funky tunes that embody seemingly every musical style in existence. I love the Zen zaniness exhibited on some songs (""Me Gustas Tu""), and the luxurious beauty of others (""Denia""). The musician's eclectic soul must be owed to his roots: he hails from southern France, but lives as a nomad of sorts in Latin America. Chao sings mainly in Spanish, but he displays an impressive multi-lingualism, crooning in his native French, as well as in English, Portuguese and even Arabic. Indeed, on some songs Chao mixes French and Spanish with such facility that it's easy to forget that they aren't the same language. Manu Chao embodies a true world music ethos, with a bohemian twist."
4,Fantastic!,"I heard this CD playing at a local Borders Book Store and I had to buy it on the spot. It was ecclectic, funky, and it makes you happy! What more can you ask for?I was completely unfamiliar with this artist so I had no real pre-conceived notions about what this CD might be like. Suffice it to say, this is a great CD, I listen to it very often and recommend it to all my friends. Between his voice, his arrangements that run the gamut from Jamaican to Brazilian influences, I have yet to find someone who doesn't like this CD. GET IT!"
1,SPT SH-1508 Tower Ceramic Heater with Ionizer,"This item did not prove the amount of room heat as expected. The family room (12 x 14) remained cold and uncomfortable until another more inexpensive heater was provided. However, it heats a small bathroom very well (4 x 5)."
1,stopped working after one year,"The unit was great...until it stopped working for no reason after only one year. We bought it in late November 2008, and today, after only nighttime winter use in two seasons, it burnt a hole in our floor and the base of the unit and has now totally stopped working. Thank god it didn't catch the whole place on fire. Of course, the warranty just expired. I do NOT recommend purchasing this unit."
4,Nice but bright!,"This machine is larger than many ceramic models but nice looking and heats very well. The fan is very quiet. I like that you can use it as a fan without heat as well. My only complaint is that the blue LCD that tells the temperature does not dim or shut off and is VERY bright. Too bright for a bedroom. Really lights it up. I'll be looking for some way of safely masking it. Otherwise very nice but hope it lasts.OCTOBER 08' UPDATE:2 California coastal winters (mild and short) and it's dead. Well not dead, but working erratically (noisy, not shutting off when the room reaches the Auto shut off temp, ...) No longer safe or usable.For the bright light, I masked it with electrical tape. Safe and effective."
2,broke after a year,"Bought this last year. The brightness of the blue light bothered my boyfriend, but it didn't bother me too much. Unfortunately after about a year, it stopped working. Just turned itself off one day, when I had it on, and now will only run for about 30 seconds before turning itself off again.It did get relatively heavy use during cold months but no other harm ever came to it."
1,Sounds like a tiny sputtering boat motor,"The shipment arrived faster than expected (nice), it was cold and I needed the heater. Other recent negative reviews about their sudden deaths were trumped by how this one was out of the box. The fan motor sputters away and it can barely muster a breeze. I hoped it would self-heal (ha), and ran it for awhile a few different times. On shut-down it sputters so badly it almost sounds relieved it's been turned off. Back it goes. Nice idea, bad manufacturing."
4,Happy about the heater but the directions are a little arcane,"The heater heats up the space well, but I am having trouble following the directions in the little handbook. Written for people on the moon, I think. Turning the device on is complicated and I haven't figured out why yet. But, it's working, so that is the pay-off."
5,A Real Sleeper,"This is one of the finest performers I have ever heard live and his album reflects it. Many of his songs are originals, both musically entertaining and with thought provoking lyrics. Ken Saydak is a superb pianist and his voice reminds me of Eric Clapton. Get this album and try to catch this band live at Andy's Jazz Club in Chicago or elsewhere."
5,5 Stars Forever,"If you've not heard of Emma Shapplin, don't wait. This seductress of melody will wrap your soul between lyric lines and you will be captured in one sitting.There is a blend of language on the album. It reminds me that listeners of all musical varieties need not know a language to understand a musical works' depth. Songwriters, Gastone di Murta and Marie-Ange Chapelin, introduce us to the feeling a despair we were once familiar with in our youth.Listen. Become captured."
5,Blown Away,"No music has ever moved me like this. Day and night the songs are either on my earphones or playing in my head. I am glad I can't understand the words. Somehow for me, that makes the experience even more powerful. I hope Emma Shapplin never becomes a ""real"" opera singer, but keeps following her own perfect instincts."
3,"! I especially like ""spente le stelle.""","I love how emma sings! I especially like ""spente le stelle."""
2,Blu-ray Option Available,"Upon receiving this DVD, I noted the fine print, which stated ""Also available in blu-ray as Earthscapes-Costa Rica.""I have owned the Blu-ray version for some time and wouldn't have ordered the DVD version had I been aware that it was the same as the Blu-ray version.Therefore, the DVD is unopened.The content of the disc is best seen on Blu-ray.I am considering returning the DVD version."
2,just don't buy it,Bought this and it worked for a year but then started to shut off immediately after turning it on THEN it would come on after about 4 or 5 seconds so my PC equipment comes on and gets shut off by this piece of crap THEN turned on again. Several times power went out and my computer died instead of it staying up due to the battery kicking in.I won't buy this model OR this brand again. A battery like this should last many years as you're almost never using it.
5,When Eagles Strike,"Terrorists have kidnapped a powerful US Senator,and are on the run. It is now up to General Thurmond's special operatives to go find him in hostile territory. Will they find him in time, or will the terrorists win the battle they have waged on the United States?SPECIAL FEATURES IN THIS DVD INCLUDE:.Digitally Mastered.Original Trailer.Scene Selection.Biographies.Interactive Menus.Preview Attractions.Optional Spanish Subtitles"
2,Out dated information and negative tone.,"While this book provides a lot of technical information it was written over seven years ago. The information provided is practically ancient in the high tech and ever changing world of IVF. The author is very dry, clinical and frankly quite negative about the chances of success. Again, this is due to the age of the book. IVF success rates have increased dramatically since this book was published. A much better, positive, timely and accurate book is The Couples Guide to IVF. It was written in this century and it much more helpful, upbeat and informative."
5,wonderful items,very nice pins!They look neat and stay securely wherever you pin them to.1) great quality2) fast shipment
2,"minimal interesting mathematics, annoying prose","I must agree with half the others who've reviewed this book here. The author's overly verbose style did not help me to understand any ideas, but instead sent me running to the dictionary. I'll gladly reread a sentence or equation in a math textbook a few times to understand it, but I don't like to read other genres in that way.I found a few interesting mathematical ideas within, but I would have been happiest if someone else had read and summarized this book for me.I was a math major if that adds perspective to my review."
2,Entertaining but unreliable,"The book completely leaves out new evidence that places the ""invention"" of zero, together with the entire place-value system, to about 50 BC in India. I believe a paper to this effect was published in Mankind Quarterly in the early 90s and also in Indian Journal of History of Science in 1994 or 95 by the historian Subhash Kak. It is well known that zero was also known to the Babylonians and the Mayans, but its use in a proper place value system seems to have occurred first in India."
2,Patton's last battle,"Well Mr Whiting , I sure as hell can guess you did'nt like ''Georgie'' there was scarcely a page went by when when you didn't refer to GSP jnr'ssqeaky voice. I could'nt help but think through the bookyou were attacking his personality .Not one for Patton lovers."
3,Not as great as I expected,"This book is good for gaining insight into the life of some Middle Eastern teenagers (both Americanized and not), but it just wasn't that captivating."
4,Refreshingly Honest,"I like the curmudgeon tone the descriptions sometimes take, for example, in describing the food choices on the small town of Tropic east of Bryce NP (on p.400), it says ""No one would make a special trip to eat in Tropic's limited array of restaurants, but once you're here it's not worth driving anywhere else either."" It's a refreshing change from the usual happy bunny tone of most guidebooks. It also hits on details other guidebooks missed, for example, of the five area guide books I have it is the only one that describes the back door path to Bryce canyon through the small road cutting though tropic. This would be my second choice for a Southern Utah park trip."
4,Good book; somewhat sloppy code,"Clear and simple book, goes right to the guts. One minus is sloppy code. It's written by a scientist who is not a programmer. Implementations are slow and sometimes inaccurate. For example, function nays8 counts 0's in one thinning algorithm. Function snays count 0's in another thinnnig algorithm, while nays8 now count 1's!Most of these comes from straightforward implementation of ideas. Sure enough, exactly this makes his code a good starting point in writing more effective programs."
1,Died after 2 years,"We got an E6 Error on our camera, sent it to the Canon Authorized Repair in Illinois. We received an estimate for $155, with a note that it could cost more to repair. There was no explanation of the problem, just ""fix due to E6 error."" So we bought a new camera (Sony) and gave up on the Canon. We owned the camera for 2 years and 3 days."
5,I LOVE IT1,"I RECEIVED THE S20 VALUE PACKAGE ABOUT A WEEK AGO AND IT'S GREAT...ESPECIALLY FOR AN ELECTRONICS NOVICE SUCH AS MYSELF..IT TAKES GREAT PICTURES WITHOUT HAVING TO BE FIDDLED WITH. I WOULD RECOMMEND BUYING THE RECHARGEABLE BATTERY UNIT WITH A COUPLE OF EXTRA RECHARGEABLE BATTERIES (A NON-RECHARGE BATTERY COMES WITH THE PACKAGE AND LASTS ONLY A SHORT TIME, RETAIL COST FOR A REPLACEMENT IS AROUND $15.00) ALSO, THE SOFTWARE IS NOT VERY USER FRIENDLY (FOR AN IDIOT LIKE MYSELF) SO THE PURCHASE OF A BOOK ON THE SOFTWARE IS IN ORDER. ALSO, I HAVE FOUND A GOOD AND I MEAN GOOD COLOR PRINTER IS THE ONLY WAY TO DO A CAMERA WITH THE 3.3 MEGAPIXELS JUSTICE. THEN ENJOY...I HAVE."
3,definitely a very basic beginner video with 1 advanced move,"Right, to be fair this is one of the first videos I have acquired and I learned a lot from it. It takes you trough fireman, front hook open knees, show girl (which is hook open knees but backwards), forwards into backwards (labelled black widow there), the chair (they call it the merry go around) than barbed wire (or tuck spin), than there is basic invert (beginner-lower intermediate), the bat (hanging backwards), cross knee release, the chopper (which is an advanced trick as it includes inverted spin) and i think that is it (may be missed one). The instructions are clear and easy to follow. There are better DVDS on the market (i mean more moves) such as Vertical Dance with KT Coats., the pole people also offers very professional videos.This video does not offer good beginner routines (there are 2 there, but not very nice IMHO). For beginner combos and dances, buy Leigh ANne Orsi videos."
4,Stormy passionate tale of romance and betrayal,"I always enjoy reading Rosalyn West's novels. This one is no exception. It's a turbulent, sometimes painful, read. Throughtout the hours reading this, I cried, sniffled, cried some more, and felt so happy for those two people Deacon and Garnet when they receive their happy ending.I also wanted to knock some sense in Deacon's thick head more than once throughout the story, because it is thanks to his tight-lipped pride the story become sometimes just too painful for them - and me.Hey, why am I complaining? I love this book."
1,Not exactly what you see,The image shows that it comes with the face plate. But guess what ? No plate. This is not good. The product could be a good quality one BUT if it not comes with what you order then it's a steal. Since the plate hole has to be exactly the dimension of the dimmer button you end up ordering another item to the same people that framed you. I know is a very bad word but I can't help feeling that way.
3,VILE ROCKS,"THIS CD IS PRETTY COOL EXCEPT FOR THE MONSTER VOCALS ON MOST OF THE SONGS. I THINK THE KEY BAND IS VILE--AMAZING VERION OF (LOVE ME LIKE A REPTILE)-- ABSOLOUTLY INGENIUS,THUMBS UP HERE!!!"
3,Senator Daschle and the anthrax letters,"For a suggestion as to why Senator Daschle, along with Senator Leahy, would have been sent a letter containing anthrax, as a symbolic target, seewww.anthraxandalqaeda.com"
2,"Cleans fine, but can you stand the smell?","You are either going to love this smell or hate it. Me, I gave it 2 stars. This smells like fake chocolate. If you're not sure if you like that smell, I suggest you go to Bloomingdales and take a sniff before you buy it, before you're stuck in a shower with it.If you do like the smell, it cleans just fine. I can't actually say anything negative on that side of things. It also does lather pretty well."
1,Philosophy Very Little Grace,"Philosophy doesn't stand behind their advertised price. I don't know any company who wouldn't honor a price, even if it was an error. It speaks volumes about them and their lack of ethics. Very Little Grace Indeed."
2,"Good book, wrong title","The book was a decent book to read on a long trip, but I had great difficulty in understanding how these stories qualify as the ""greatest sailing stories ever told"". They were sailing stories, and that's about all I could give it. Two or three of the stories were truly great; the rest were real snoozers. I was very disappointed with the book and could barely make myself finish it because I felt deceived by the author/editor's choice of title. A better title would be 'Sailing Stories, the Good and the Boring.'"
3,so - so,"As other reviewers have said, this has some good stories and accounts, but mostly it's at best sailing related, not actually stories about sailing as the title implies."
1,Returning this c.d. came NATURALLY to me !!!,"As a long-time Sheena fan, this is probably one of her worst! Sheena has such vocal talent that she really doesn't need to stoop to this level of noise pollution like she did with ""The Lover In Me."" Thank God she is once again singing beautiful songs that her voice was meant to sing like her ""No Strings"" c.d."
1,Culture Shock is an Option,"First, Tutankhamen was Akhenaten's son not his brother.Not being a scientist, I'm not sure if time travel is possible; I rather doubt that it is. It can make for good stories, but not this one.Apparently the author has never heard of culture shock. If it were possible for King Tut to have gone (by magic, no less!) to late 20th Century America (and suddenly be able to speak English; he even gets to drive a car!), the culture shock would have been so severe that he would have gone catatonic. The Americans back in 18th Dynasty Egypt would have had almost as great a culture shock, plus being exposed to all kinds of diseases.Can you image a police officer's reaction after pulling over a car and being told the passenger is King Tut?As with many modern fiction writers, the author does not understand the ancient spirituality and mystique of kingship."
4,"Yoga for exercise, not relaxation","This is a great yoga DVD for people looking to do more of a yoga workout than a yoga relaxation due to the pace and structure. If you are looking for a good 10 minute yoga routine for relaxation, try the original 10 Minute Solution with Michelle instead."
4,wow-eee! Not for a the un-familiar to yoga,"I liked this video but the 1st 10 minute segment whipped me. I am not new to yoga but it has been several years since I took a class. I bought this video so I could enjoy yoga again. I think this is not exactly what I was looking for.Regardelss of that, the instructor is clear but fast. She does not give you the 'soft' or 'easy' poses but the full-fledged whoop-your-bootie pose. I was sweating bullets at the end of the first segment and had to stop.It is definately a work-out. It's flowing but intense. I was looking for something calm and relaxing with lots of breathing in the poses. This is not for you if you are seeking the same. Be prepared to work hard with this one."
1,"No VIsta x64 Support, claims Vista support on package","False advertising, package claims Vista compatible but they have no drivers for x64 and if you read the replies people have gotten from reps at Microsoft they don't plan any. Good job supporting your own hardware and OS MS."
1,Does not encrypt fingerprint!,"A nice device, but Microsoft didn't include software that encrypts the fingerprint image. Although very difficult to do someone *could* steal your fingerprint. To be safe I would not use this fingerprint reader for password protected websites that contain sensitive information or for network admin or computer BIOS privledges."
1,Won't read my finger,I guess my hands are too dry? I tried 2 different readers & neither one would work. The reader also wouldn't recognise some of the websites I needed it for.
3,"Works great, if you don't use Firefox.","The fingerprint reader took about 5 minutes to install and set up my fingerprint scan. As long as you are using IE it works great. It does not seem to work with Firefox at all. Of course being a Microsoft branded item, getting any support is nearly impossible."
2,It is what it is,Low end biometrics.... works when it wants to. I never got it to work as a login device for Windows and my many attempts to use it as a way to save myself from logging into websites didn't prove to be any better than just loggin in using the keyboard. Save your money and buy another toy to play with...
3,Only work about half the time on first try,"This fingerprint only work about half the time on first try. Other time I had to touch the reader 2 to 4 times before it would log into the website. Sometime I think it has more trouble than its worth. If you have oilly finger, you would also need frequent cleaning. Be very careful when register your finger print on the first visit to any website. If you type in the wrong password, there appear no way to correct your mistake and you can't use your fingerprint reader for that website. The only way I can fix it was uninstall the software."
3,"Does not read your finger print well, and software has issues.","It works, sometimes, usually though it takes 4 or 5 try's to get it to work. Not a very solid choice."
2,Fingerprint and Pray!,"I've had this for over 4 weeks now. Its a good idea, but poorly implemented. I'm using Windows XP Professional with the latest device driver that comes with ""Password Manager 2.0"", and the main issues:#1 Doesn't work for Windows logon if your machine is in a ""Domain""#2 Even with just 3-4 times a day use, the lens gets dirty every 2-3 days, and cleaning it is non-trivial#3 The performance is slow, especially for non-IE applications#4 It tends to hang the browser/application if you multi-task while its trying to logon.Overall poor: Its like the earlier buggy releases of windows ""plug 'n play"". This is ""fingerprint 'n pray""!"
3,"good product, but limited","nice product, but it is limited for only password applicaton. you cant use it for other purpose. but good."
5,Don't be that guy...read this before you send another proposal!,"As an owner/director of an elite cycling program, the one thing holding us back has been funding...that is about to change.I have read everything I could find to give me direction and nothing prior to this book said anything different. It was all about ""whats in it for me"" mentality when sending a power point based resume to corporations.After reading this book, I have to admit I was that guy with shotgun proposals, search and replace power points (at least I customized the artwork for each) that were identical.I highly recommend this book to every sponsorship seeker, regardless of your experience level, this is a game changer!Allen WOwner/DirectorFirefighters Racing"
5,The Sponsorship Seeker's Toolkit,This is the definitive guide for anyone looking for a corporate sponsor. It was enjoyable to read and I find myself reaching for it time and again. The concepts were easy to grasp and the tools were especially useful. It is a great source of information for beginners as well as seasoned sponsorship seekers. It's a great read and well worth purchasing.
5,A must for anyone procuring sponsorships,"Being a realtive newcomer to sponsorship procurement, this book has been valuable and well used. The Sponsorship Seeker's Toolkit teaches every step necessary to make first contact, foster relationships, build a creative winning proposal, administer your proposal and prepare followup reports.This and the two previous Sponsorship Seekers Toolkit can take a novice and teach them how to speak to sponsors confindently and knowledgably.If you're a seasoned professional, Kim and Anne-Marie come up with such creative partnerships, you'll find yourself smiling over the common sense they inject into every chapter.This book has taught my staff how to present proposals that will enhance multiple sponsors, thereby giving them more bang for their buck as well as making the event more memorable for the audience.This book is a dog-eared must in my professional library."
1,es una perdida de dinero,"aveces funciona otras no, cuando funciona el tiempo de disparo es muy largo... en otras ocaciones no detecta la señal del control remoto.. en resumen es un completo desperdicio de dinero :("
2,Key-Chain Wireless Remote SUCKS,"To Men (or women who carry keys in pocket) WARNING: The key-chain wireless remote will NOT last long. I've gone through 3 so far -- on each, the keys (for ARM &/or DISARM) simply collapse and make continuous contact (remote is useless).Extremely poor design! GE obviously did not perform any quality assurance testing on the remote.As far as the alarm is concerned -- no complaint. Has worked great w/long battery life (AA cells)."
1,"KOHLER K-8803-CP Duostrainer Basket Strainer, Polished Chrome","Stem became loose from the body of the strainer just like the one it replaced. This makes it impossible to change the unit from strainer to stopper. The difference is this new one happened in just a few weeks. Kohler needs to come up with a better way of attaching the stem to the strainer body. For what they charge for this strainer you'd think they, Kohler, would solve this problem."
1,Extremely poor quality - Fails under light use,"I never experienced breakage of a sink strainer before buying and installing the expensive Kohler Duostrainer. But, like the other reviewers, mine broke after a couple of years of light use. If anyone knows of an equivalent replacement (from Europe? Australia?) that isn't cheap junk like the Kohler, please post details in a comment to this review."
2,kohler duo-strainer opinion,"Remodeled kitchen spring of 2010. New sink and all surfaces replaced. When picking out the drains we went with the Kohler Duo-Strainer units. I thought they were over priced- but sometimes you get what you pay for. Not this time. So far the baskets have not broken, but the o-rings last a short time. Trying to find replacement o-rings of the proper size with no luck. Do not want to replace the baskets to get a dimes worth of o-rings. Will keep you posted."
3,"Interesting book, but . . .","The Mysterious death of Mary Rogers was an interesting story. I was enjoying the analysis of society and culture, but then a little error threw me off. It was a simple error, I do not even recall now what it was. It was towards the middle of the book. It seemed as though surely someone should have caught it. It was distracting, and it made me wonder about the scholarship of the rest of the book."
2,It's Cheaper Elsewhere,"I bought this a couple times for my SiPix A6 Printer before find the same paper elsewhere, specifically a website that sells paper of various specialist types: Micro Format, Inc. From AceDepot through Amazon.com the paper is $13.99 per 100 plus shipping, from Micro Format the same paper is $25 per 500 plus shipping. You do the math for per sheet costs but Micro Format is significantly cheaper and you get larger quantities at a time.(I.E, it is $36 for a single carton with shipping and $62.24 for two with shipping, though they want a Credit Card) ACEDEPOT does not sell in carton (500 Sheet) and they want more per sheet than Micro Format,Inc. Simply put It's cheaper to buy this product elseware."
2,SiPix printer,"I am really mad with this product. When somebody want to buy througt your web site missing a lot of information about the product. I supposed to get an item that I was looking for but unfortunatly the printer only work with Windows 98 despite the Cd software says it is work with XP also. I have had to buy connector, cables, because the laptop computer has not the type of connector that this printer has. To finish, I do not have time and money to send this product back. if somebody can help me to setup this printer to my laptop I'd appreciate it. I won't recomend this product to anybody."
2,Disappointing,"I found the structure of the book annoying - you constantly had to flip around to get menues and recipies and grocery lists, etc. Also, while the book description says it gives calorie amounts, it doesn't break down where the calories come from, so if you want to make substitutions or swap meals from one day to another, you don't know how that changes the calories."
1,dont buy this,the product that is being sent out is NOT the product that is pictured. they are sending out an oblong platter with no handles made from STONEWARE (it's not even corelle). extremely unhappy!!!!
3,Ok book,"The book was in great condition, but it was not exactly what I expected. This seems more like a literature book rather than a travel book."
1,pass on this picchu,"This book will not significantly enrich any persons knowledge of this priceless architectural relic. Poorly written, poorly illustrated and frustrating devoid of any new perspective or information, many publications available are considerably better at providing an understanding of this fantastic site. Pass on this one."
5,Loved it!!,"I enjoyed this book and gobbled it up in two days; I'm only sad it wasn't longer. The writing reminds me of Fanny Flagg or Billie Letts, two of my favorite authors. The story had adventure and romance and explosions and mean dogs and a great ending. The characters were well rounded, flawed, and wonderfully human. I can't wait to read other books from this author."
5,leather seat conditioner,I bought a box of 6 so I can give them away as gifts. I like the product because it conditions the leather and leaves my interior smelling great!
5,Excellent Biography,"I actually read this book about 4 years agoand thought that it was an excellent review of Chris's life. I began listening to Chris at an early age and was very interested to learn more about his life and this book was just the tool i needed. There are some excellent pictures of Chris riding broncs, and others of him in his younger years. I highly recommend this book to any one who is a Chris Ledoux fan."
2,"Wouldn't work on my computers, but was returned without a problem","After many attempts to install, uninstall, reinstall, etc, I was never able to get this game to function properly on my computers. It might be too old to be compatible with my 5 year old Windows XP and 1 year old Windows 7 computers. None of the error messsages were among those listed on the HER Interactive technical FAQ section. The seller readily accepted the return of the game without any problems, and refunded the money which I was grateful for."
4,Better than some,"I thought this one was good but i found all of the tasks that the cook gave us took so much time and were really tedious. I really like the ending in this one (i won't tell you who does it) but my favourite one so far is ""message in the haunted mansion."""
5,GREAT GAME!!!!:),i really loved this nancy drew game it was one of the better efforts of her interactive. i thought it gave you a great perspective of how things really work on a ranch. and if you love to ride...this will be your official alltime favorite game.
3,Not my favorite Nancy Drew game.,I have every Nancy Drew game and I would have to rate this one my least favorite. I liked the idea of the game being a treasure hunt with clues to find but the puzzles were too easy or just plain annoying. I would not recommend this title to a newbie. I would suggest any other Nancy Drew title to play first and then if you absolutely have to play them all I would get this one.For newbies I would recommend getting a multi pack. Like the 75th Anniversary or Mega Mystery pack. You will get more games for less money and I am sure you will be hooked on the series.
3,"Whipped Cream, No Cake","Although nicely written by a medical intuitive, I was disappointed in this slight offering. The information was basic to the point of being simplistic. The boxed thoughts which were to be used a meditations were neither memorable nor effective. In less skilled hands, this book would be trivial and annoying.This is not to say, it has no value. It is a quick and easy read and the author's experiences are fascinating. Some will find comfort but none will find depth. In many ways, this is like having the whipped cream but not the cake. It is frothy and light. I was expecting a more substance, detailed program for accessing guidance. This is not unlike those inspirational angel blurbs/chicken soup for the soul stories featured in womens magazines--marginally moving, completely forgettable."
1,Good book if you want less then a 600!!,"Unless you're someone who only needs to skim the material and take practice tests, this book is not for you. I suggest you buy a different book. The book does a poor job of reviewing material. If you're taking this test after a Regents Living Environment Class in New York This is NOT FOR YOU. The practice tests included in this book are too easy. I the questions were so broad and easy. The day I took the exam, I saw a totally different test. Unless you have taken AP Bio I suggest you try another book."
1,Dont waste your money,"I was extremely disappointed to find that the last few discs in this set were NOT the Dick Van Dyke show! They had half hour segments from other old sitcoms...what is THAT all about?! I felt like returning this DVD because I felt duped, but I it was more trouble than it was worth to re-wrap it and get it to the post office. I'm saving you all a trip...don't waste your money on this one!"
3,not so sure...,"I was just sampling the sound of this band, and am greatly intrigued by everything EXCEPT the total lack of vocal strength. Is it bad mixing in production? The breathiness is a total, annoying tease! Get it on already and sing! Stop holding back! It's not clever, it doesn't work -- sounds sophomoric compared to the sophisticated, complex musical layering and instrumentation. I realize this style of vocals is trendy in indie rock today, but it's taken too far here. Although I'm female, dare I say this complaint compares to the idea (although a metaphor of course) to giving the listener ""blue balls?"""
3,YA la tengo,it's ok. typical. certainly not revolutionary. good. some good singles in there. but it is adequate and nothing more.
3,Columbia Castle Complete,"""The Old Dark House"", ""Zotz"" and ""Thirteen Frightened Girls"" are new to DVD. The other films Sony has previously released. I would have to say that of all this films in this collection, ""Thirteen Frightened Girls"" is the worst of the lot. It's not even scary. Since Columbia Pictures also produced the ""Gidget"" series of films, this one could easily have been retitled ""Gidget Goes Spying."""
2,Where's the OBSCURITIES? Why release stuff that's already been available?,"There are only 3 items on this set that I don't have, and that's ""13 Frightened Girls"", ""Old Dark House"" (remake) and ""Zotz"" (which sounds rather stupid & has Tom Poston, who I don't like). Where's ""Macabre""? Where's ""Night Walker""? I have ""I Saw What You Did"" so I don't really care about that not being included, but it's very disappointing that this is mostly a rehash of stuff that's already been released & not some of the other works that have never been released on DVD (and let's not forget ""Let's Kill Uncle""...or maybe we should). I'm not shelling out $70 for the three movies I haven't seen, that's a bit much."
1,Not recommended,"I bought for a trip to Europe where there are usually no coffee makers in the room. I used it 2 times to heat water for tea, third time it died. Same hotel, same amount of water. Waste of money."
3,Not great,"This tea kettle is almost good. Mine didn't shut off when it boiled the first time and water when everywhere. I had to use less water than the ""maximum"" and be there when it started to boil. It must be manually switched from one voltage to the other using a small screw on the bottom. It seems to have no fuse to reset if the switch doesn't quite click into place, like mine. It burned up. I'm going back to taking a larger 220V tea kettle with me to Europe/Asia etc, and my 110V to places in the US and others using 110V."
2,Absolutely ridiculous and unbelievable.,"I was drawn to this book at the airport -- looking for a light read and the premise seemed liked it could lead to a funny, entertaining novel. I also was intrigued to read something by a German author. Unfortunately, I was really disappointed. I've heard that it is difficult to translate German novels into English and I'd like to believe that to give this one the benefit of the doubt. The pace of events is overly rapid, to say the least. The main character places a personal add stating she is in search of an impotent man. The replies are entertaining. But the relationships she develops in the course of the story are completely unbelievable. One man she meets becomes a person she regards as one of her best friends in a week; her elderly neighbor is a bosom buddy in just a few days; she and the man of her dreams are deeply in love within about 2 days of meeting each other and after 2 weeks look headed for the alter. Absolutely ridiculous."
3,Good content but not enough detail.,"I enjoyed reading this book but found the information to be over simplified, more suited to a pamphlet than a book. I would like to see a more indepth discussion of the techniques."
4,deep embedded,This was a great deal to have some trouble with a beautiful woman who won a super star in the movie is going through my head and are the stars of the strongest in the ocean is a lot of different levels of fun there's nothing wrong with the sound turned down a great deal of time before the most important part of the house is going be destroyed so I give it a four.
3,the sarah jane adventures second season,The adventures were as expected and were well actedDoctor Who: The Complete Specials (The Next Doctor / Planet of the Dead / The Waters of Mars / The End of Time Parts 1 and 2). Now why didn't I give it a 5 star rating. The first set I got wouldn't load disk 2 or 3. The second set would only come up on my computer. All other BBC disk work properly. The disk recording is lousy hence the won't load problem.
4,good clean fun for all ages,"Good clean fun for all ages, especially pre-teens and teens, as well as adults.A touch of mystery, excitement and save the world attitude.Enjoyable."
4,wonderful family entertainment,"The Sarah Jane Adventures: The Complete Second Season was very entertaining and fun to watch. As a long-time Dr. Who fan, I love the concept of Sarah Jane Smith still having wonderful adventures on her own, and as the mother of a 13 year old, the Sarah Jane Adventures are a family hit. These stories have a slightly lower ""scare factor"" than Dr. Who, and because the stories are all about Sarah Jane and her bunch of teenage helpers they appeal to a younger audience, while still being fun for the ""grown-ups""."
2,It's over - at last,"Very disappointing conclusion to a disappointing series. The finale is, to put it mildly, unsatisfying, full of old horror-cliches and very badly written. Saul may not be the greatest horror author alive but he has proven in other novels that he can do better than THAT"
5,Here is my title,"Having never heard of Shivaree before, my boyfriend brought me to a concert of theirs. From the first chord, I was mesmorized by the music and, of course, Ambrosia's voice. This album promises nothing less than that."
4,Very Good- but not her best,I love Danielle Steel- she can never do wrong by me thats why i say this book was very good. It brought the usual tears to my eyes here and there. And had a wonderful ending.
1,I tried again.....,"I gave Danielle Steel another chance because I thought that maybe this book would be better after I read the other reviewers. I was misled. Same old story, same pathetic woman with no back bone. Her books are depressing. This one was not quite as bad as ""Unanswered Prayers"", but it was not all that great either. A reader gets tired of being told the same information over and over again, like we can't remember what happened two chapters before. I am glad I checked this out from the library and did not waste $20.00."
2,DON'T GET THE AUDIOBOOK-YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED,"As I have stated in a previous post, a narrator can make or break most books...In Safe Harbour, even Kyf Brewer (the narrator) sounds bored, which in turn makes me feel bored. I usually love a male narrator but in this case I am really disappointed.I am not saying that the book itself is not worth reading- I have not yet determined that because I am still forcing myself to hang in there and finish this book, but I would suggest to anyone reading this to try the paperback or hardcopy over the audiobook.***** UPDATE *****THIS BOOK IS HOOOOORRRRRRIIIBBBBLLLLEEEE.OK, EVEN WITH THE BORED NARRATOR THIS BOOK IS VERY SLOW AND UNINTERESTING.IT DRAGS ON AND ON AND ON. THE SAME PHRASES AND THE SAME DESCRIPTIONS ARE GIVEN OVER AND OVER AND OVER...I DON'T THINK I'LL EVER READ ANOTHER DANIELLE STEELE AGAIN IN MY ENTIRE LIFE!AND I THINK THE NARRATOR FEELS THE SAME BECAUSE HIS VOICE IS SO LIFELESS..."
3,Safe Harbour,Has Danielle Steel given up using editors? I found the pages 79 through 82 so repetitive and confusing. How many times must the same sentence written in many different ways be used? DS needs to hire new editors - this is the third book in a row that lacks good editing. We all know that Matt's wife has sent him cards at Christmas!! I agree with the other posters that her latest books are being turned out too quickly and she will be losing a lot of readers.
4,Safe Harbour,"This is the story of a woman who lost her son and husband in a plane crash, and how she recovers with the help of her daughter and a new friend. As with most of Danielle Steel's stories, there is tragedy - but love heals all wounds and there is a happier ending. This is a heart-warming story and well worth taking the time to read. I highly recommend it!"
1,"Ugh, Boring and repetitive","Reading this book was like reading a soap opera script. Nothing happened, the same events were rehashed over and over and everything is revealed through a secret window the reader has into the thoughts of the characters.The story was weak, the characters far worse and the premise completely ridiculous.Why would any woman, depressed or otherwise, allow their 11-year-old daughter to continue a strange friendship with a strange older man she met on the beach? Implausible. Especially for someone who has lost all her loved ones, to even take the chance with the daughter being lost, insane.Danielle Steel is a terrible writer, that is if she even writes these books anymore.Poor writing, poor editing...what a waste of my time!"
2,"Good content, very bad linkage between content and example","This is sort of great book to read. It provided a very comfortable air to learn a lot of stuff - in just a few pages ( only 283). However, I think the book also have very poor linkage between the book content and example source code. The book explains and traces the source code well. On the other hand, most likely, you won't know which source file to look into, how to compile, or how to run ( of course, in few cases, the authors will tell you). If the reader want to learn from book text and code example simultaneously( which I think is the best way to learn ), this book will definitely give you a lot of hard time. You can download the zip files and extract them but you can not easily map source code to book's chapters and sections. Definitely not a good book for people who don't know ASP or VB in advance."
2,KRS,"This book had some interesting examples of XML data islands and use of the MSXMLDOM object, such as for adding nodes and iterating through nodes. However, the book is relplete with annoying typos and its exmaples are hard to read. In addition, the examples are incomplete in some cases. There were not enough examples of ASP-XML as its title implies. If you're looking for alot of ASP-XML exmaples, don't buy this book."
1,Worst book,OOOhhhh gosh I can't believe that how the publisher accepted this garbage. No example works. Every thing is contradictory. Its not worth of spending a penny or a minute.Mike
1,Avoid at all costs,"A poorly written book with bad and simplistic examples. don't waste your money, there are far better books out on the subject."
3,Not what I expected,"The story itself is good but it just wasn't developed well enough. I didn't think that the characters were developed as well as they could have been. Yes, there is a murder mystery, yes there is a great love story, but it just didn't touch me the way I was hoping it would. The way this book is written, it sort of rushes through the plot. It felt as if the writer was in a hurry to finish the book. And on top of that - the ending wasn't conclusive. I wish it was more concrete."
5,A film that makes me want to read the book.,"Having not yet read the book, I am not comparing the relative merits of book vs. film. Isabelle Huppert is a beautiful actress who convincingly portrays a dislikable character. Emma comes from a wealthy farming background and marries Charles Bovary, a doctor who works very hard, loves his wife, and wants to have children. Yet Emma cannot find her purpose in life and she is dying of ennui. She goes through the motions of having a baby but cannot connect with the child. Bored with her husband she searches endlessly for more exciting relationships and winds up in the depths of despair. The film is able to emphasize the comforts that she is able to afford, each scene showing a her in a more dazzling costume than the last. In the end, like the fisherman's wife, she winds up with nothing, consumed by her own insatiable desires. END"
1,Didn't Work,"I took a chance with this video, since it got so-so reviews, and I was disappointed...when I put the DVD in, it came up with a simple menu, no images, just a simple content list. Then, I wasn't able to click onto the content and play it. Totally didn't work! I'm going to try to return it..."
4,Really good.,"I'm not a very big NOFX fan, I only own a few of their albums (SLATFATS, Pump up the valuum, Punk in Drublic), this being my favorite one. I really like the ska songs on here, 'All outta angst', 'All his suits are torn', 'Quart in session' and 'Dad's bad news' are my favorite songs on here, even though I can usually listen to this straight threw. The only thing is, for me, it gets boring, real fast, but it's still great. You should get this if you like some ska with your punk"
1,"if you want a nofx cd, this is not it","For anyone who wants to listen to NOFX go out and buy an old album. Their last two or three releases have sucked. They lost their style that made them NOFX. They have become soft. This is not for punkers, put for trendy people. I am a huge fan but I would not own any NOFX newer than punk in drubic. If you want to hear real NOFX buy punk in drublic, white trash..., ribbed, longest line, any old album, but NOT THIS ONE."
5,great CD,"when i bought this CD i didnt think it was gonna be that great, but when i turned it on, it was the best music i have ever heard since blink-182's first album. i havent been a punk fan my whole life but im learning very quickly. Even if i havent been a fan of NOFX or punk very long, i know that this is truly real punk. This CD has great lyrics and awsome sounds. buy this CD if your a punk fan or not, and if your not, it will certainly help you become one."
3,"Great idea, poor construction.","I love the size and possibilities of this grow light. The connectors, however, to make the pieces hold together are poorly constructed and break easily. The connectors were randomly placed and I had to remove a couple before i could fit the pieces together correctly. This made what should have been 10-minute construction turn into 30 minutes while I figured out I had to remove a connector completely and place it elsewhere in order to build the frame. One connector broke, one holding the two lengths of the foot together, before i was even finished constructing the frame. I put duct tape on it and it's holding together that way. Once the connector broke, I'm not sure it could be pulled out from the hollow metal piece and therefore even having an extra connector included in the packaging might not help. Anyway, the light is great and the idea is fantastic. It is hateful, however, to have something broken before one can even use it the first time."
3,relatively inexpensive and works well,"The light serves its function well and saves you the time to building a growing light set up yourself. You can certainly purchase the bulb and a light fixture at home depot for less, but will have to be industruous enough to build a hanging set up."
5,T5 is the way to go for economy and a super light output,I have had this up and running for 3 weeks now and the plants in my small greenhouse are jumping.The locking cord to raise and lower is very useful and works great. the tubular frame of the stand is strong and nice looking. I would buy it again.
3,Good for beginners,All and all a good product. However we (three adults) had difficulty making the hardwear provided work. We ended up having to purchase different hardwear. The directions weren't very helpful either but I am happy with the product now that it is up and running.
1,too narrow for seed starting,"While this grow light is advertised with 72-cell seed starting trays, it is much too narrow to work well. The single bulb reflector is only 3 1/2 inches wide so doesn't cover the ten inch width of a 72 cell seed starting tray. The 72 cell tray is six cells wide but the light only adequately covers three cells. The result is that the outside seedlings are leaning over to the center, trying to get enough light. They are spindly as a result. Don't buy this light if using 72 cell trays, but buy a wider light."
5,Love it,"This is the second one I have purchased. A very nice table grow light. Sturdy, very functional, and simple to adjust the height of the light. I would buy another."
2,Quality,"Socket retaining tabs were broken out of box, and pulling sockets off tabs broke them off backing board as I was setting it up. Threw it right in trash."
2,One of them leaked,"One of the pair leaked, probably a faulty valve. I notified the company and they sent me a replacement.I would stick with SpeedBleeders brand in the future."
4,Lots of Laughs,I just started reading this book the other day and I can't stop laughing out loud. This is a great read for someone looking to escape from the daily pressures of life and to just have a good laugh. I already have a few friends in mind that I want to pass it along to. Great read!
1,oh my gawd,"I am a big Sopranos fan, but I am a little fed up withe stereotypes represented in the reviews. EVEN THE SOPRANOS has more depth when speaking about Italian culture than whoever is writing here, and I am loathe to believe they could be Italian-American."
4,Good information,"Very detailed information about most herbs, I wish there were more in there, but the ones they do list are very detailed in their descriptions."
4,A Very Nice Story,"This is a story of two souls that need each other to heal the wounds of the past. This is a well written story with wonderful lead characters and alright secondary characters. Brandon and Olivia both have harsh upbrings to over come, and although Brandon seems to overcome his first. Both finally emit the love they share. This book has one of my pet peeves in it and that is one of the lead characters runs away instead of facing the problems and solving them."
5,Better than Extra Strength Excedrin,"HIPAA regulations really do make sense. Unfortunately, you'd never see that by reading them as they are presented by the feds. I can only imagine the hours I could have saved and the headaches I could have avoided by having something simple like this to reference... rather than that mind-numbing Federal Register. Combine this e-document with the great search features of Acrobat Reader 6.0 and you're sure to have an extremely useful HIPAA reference!"
4,very good product,This is a good phone and a very fast and efficient store. the only thing I don't like is the tone of the bell.
1,Zero stars if I could rate it that way,"Very noisy, cuts clear out anywhere around a corner or line of sight over 40 feet. What a piece of junk, I want my money back. Advertised as a working phone but does not even come close to the performance touted by Uniden or Amazon as representing. Should be pulled from sale as soon as possible. I may not use AMAZON again, I have been a good customer for a long time but this is jut not right!!"
3,Missing Feature I needed,"I actually returned this item because when I got it, I realized it didn't have a mute or hold button on the handset. The base had it, but I work from home with three loud kids and when I'm on the move, I need a cordless with a mute function. I really thought that was a standard feature on most cordless phones. Other than that, the phone worked well and I liked how it looked. Just needed the mute button!"
3,not so hot,The cordless phone with this set does not hold a charge well. I am having to recharge it every third day.
1,Bad voice quality,I have gone through 5 phones trying to find one with crisp quality sound. This phone is terrible. I finally found an analog Panasonic corded phone (KX-TS620) that performs exactly as I expect.
4,relaxing,"This CD is great for helping relax young children at night, as well as adults. Makes great background music for dinner parties, or romantic moments. Very calming, melodic and beautiful, also good for yoga. I give this CD to all my friends and relatives having babies as a shower gift, and everyone loves it!"
1,Dont support this garbage,"The Grammy award show doesent really celebrate whats good in music. It just celebrates whats popular and mainstream, and most popular/mainstream music is garbage. The Black Eyed Peas, Usher, Evanescence, and numerous other acts shouldent be at the grammies. Why not put on talented bands such as CKY, Malevolent Creation, or Cradle of Filth? You may not think those are the greatest bands ever (although in my opinion they are very good), but at least they have alot of talent. Dont support this garbage."
3,Just okay,I've purchased these since 2002 and was not pleased with this one...I would check out the songs before you buy this round.
4,Good album--but too ballad heavy,"This is a good album, but it's too ballad heavy. Where's Yeah by Usher? I'd want that on here instead of Burn. Where's Jay-Z's 99 Problems? Or any Kanye West song? Or Velvet Revolver? Those few should have packed punch to this ballad heavy album. But that's the Grammys--they like to play it safe instead of taking chances. Alicia Keys, Brian Wilson, Ray Charles,Gretchen Wilson, Joss Stone, Norah Jones, Josh Groban, Seal and others are some good choices here. But the ballad mode makes the album drag. It's best to have quality, safe songs here, but I'd like some crazy, rocking wild stuff on here too! And that's what makes the album fall short!"
5,This CD is good bvut however I like 2004 kind of better,"I think 2004 grammy nominees were better , I like the CD 2005 but I just think 2004 had better songs ! lousy Song selections!"
5,Lovely...,This nicely bound book is chock full of gorgeous beads to look at and sigh over. A real treat for anyone who likes to look at or create beaded jewelry.
5,NATURALLY FAKIN' IT!!!,"De-Phazz's oxymoronically titled ""Natural Fake"" is a cocktail of neo-modern lounge, jazz, funk, soul and r&b. This German group has marvellously evolved the ""lounge-sounds"" they delivered on the classics ""Death By Chocolate"" and ""Godsdog"" with catchy hooks, quirky samples and gorgeous vocals from both male and female. There's 18 songs listed--a bit gluttonous to most--but at least the songs don't meander, and manage to keep your attention from beginning to end. True fans of De-Phazz will appreciate this new sound and not expect a repeat of their previous material. Highly Recommended!!!"
1,It wreaked,"This book was extremely farout. None of this really happened . The book ""the super hacker"" was much better!!!! Do not waste your money!!!!!"
2,Haiku Review--The Psalms: Strophic Structure and Theological Commentary,"Liberal approach:Redactors play loose with faith?Old, agnostic cult?"
1,Are you kidding me?,"What an amazing idea for a book. If only the author had enough intelligence to actually learn what a musical was or perhaps look at at least one score before charging us forty dollars. For example, Audrey II, in ""Little Shop of Horrors"", is clearly a Bass yet we are told HE is a Soprano. The last song that Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II ever wrote together was ""Edelweiss"". However Mr. Devenney does not feel it necessary to include it with the other songs in ""Sound of Music"". Perhaps he needed room for ""Cable hears Bali Ha'i"" in ""South Pacific"", which is kind of funny because the song does not exist. We can chalk a few mistakes up to the editors... let's say 1...2...maybe even 3 but just based on a simple cover to cover reading, there were..... drumroll ......................47."
5,SUPER Service,Excellent speed and customer service. Would purchase from this seller again in a heartbeat. Highly recommend.
1,being a name brand i expected alot more,"I bought this shoe for my son and really thought it would be everything that it said it was, but we were so surprised when i noticed after just two weeks that the the bottom of shoe on the soles cracked all the way across! I was so shocked it being name brand that it would do that! Needless to say i am very disappointed for alot of reasons. Would not recommend this shoe!"
3,Didn't do much for me...,"A disappointing snoozer of a French art film, one of Claude Chabrol's later efforts... Isabelle Huppert stars as a con lady with an older accomplice, in what is (I assume) intended as a deconstruction of your typical caper flick, with the scams going awry and the plot details involving the ironic inclusion of modern European culture... But there's little momentum in the script and direction, or spark between any of the actors. This film just kind of sits there and does very little to surprise or amuse. Next!"
1,"Did not work, loud humming coming from sub","I bought this with the hopes of having an average system for not much money. After researching the product online I found the system can have problems with shielding. However, after trying the speakers into several different plugs I determined there is something wrong with the sub itself. The humming noise gets worse when all the wires are plugged in. Requested return with the hopes of getting a replacement system that is operational. Once that happens I will update."
5,Best computer speakers for your buck.,"Although i have it connected to my video games and watch DVDs using the speakers, it sounds as good as all the expensive surround sound systems. You will feel proud of purchasing this item because it has quality sound, and the for the price its being sold why not? I will soon be connecting it to my PC, which is going to sound 10 times better than the stock speakers, in order to make room for the Logitech Z-5300e. This will be my surround sound theater system. It all depends how much you want to spend on a sound system, the higher you go the better the sound well with Logitech."
4,Nice speakers for the money,"I recently bought these speakers from ""Computer Brain""* and they were easy to unpack when they arrived. They were also easy to set-up, it took about 15 mins and the look alot better in person than in the pics here. The sound quality was good for how much they cost, but the bass is a little low. I am playing music through winamp on vista /w virtual surround sound turned on. Basically they do what i want them to, sounds for web surfing, playing mp3s and maybe a game or 2 and thats it. I would recommend the speaker to anyone who uses their computer for basic things like mentioned above. If you're a heavy gamer then get some $200 speakers, you'll be happier.Pros:1. Wall mountable2. Good sound / Price ratio3. Nice looking4. Easy set-upCons:1. Kinda low bass2. Kinda flimsey/light-weight3. distortion at very high levels*I had an AWEFUL experience with ""Computer Brain"", will NOT buy from THEM again and would recommend you buy these speakers from someone else."
4,Pretty good sound system.,Pretty good sound for the price. Although the front and center speakers are much louder than the rear speakers. Pretty good bass from the subwoofer. Easy connections. Would recommend for the cost conscious shopper.
4,pretty decent speakers,"I love these speakers, i love finally being able to enjoy 5.1 surround sound instead of just a 2.1 setup. when audio is playing, it sounds great! the subwoofer is very deep and packs a punch, the gain is set to minimum, and the 3 bass settings on my computer's creative sound blaster xtremegamer sound card are set to minimum and yet that sub can still pack a punch, more so than my previous system.The only problem I have with this system is that when there is no audio, and theres just silence, when the volume is at least 20%, you can hear a whinning/hissing sound that can get pretty loud depending on how high the volume is set to. My friend has the same system and the same issue, and I see through many of the reviews of the same issue occurring so I doubt it is just my speakers being defective and just a coincidence."
4,Awesome value!!!,"These speakers will sound the same as 100 dollar speakers to most. The subwoofer is unbelievable. I usually have it tuned to the lowest setting cause it will out pace the speakers. However, currently I am running only 4 speakers cause I don't have a sound card on my laptop, so it's not even at its best and full capability. So I wouldn't fully recommend this for laptop users unless you will buy an external sound card. If you have the money, spend the extra 150 to get some Klispch or higher models of logitech. Creative is not bad either. But if you are on a budget, for 55 plus rebate, you CANNOT go wrong. I am fully satisfied, no problems, even delivery was way fast for budget shipping. But unless you have a good sound card, a 150 dollar system and this one will sound pretty much the same."
2,need to fix the bass,"the first time when I turn the volume to the maximum, the bass can handle that, but the next days later, when I turn the volume to maximum, the bass cant handle that, I can hear the bad sound, the bass is broken the sound, no more clear. I paid up to 100$ for the speaker, and now i got bad thing. No good at all"
4,"Not the most powerful, but defintely worth the money","The sound is very deep from the sub-woofer and clear from the satellites. I was overjoyed with the quality, but was ignorant of the fact that one needs a sound card to use all 5 speakers. I used only two satellites until I bought a Creative Audigy 2 sound card for laptops (strongly recommended, roughly $100) and now I am reaping the benefit of fuller sound, all around. I am giving it 4 because it's not the best sound system you can get for your computer, but if you want an upgrade from any stock speakers, it will be a huge improvement. I would give it a 5 in its class."
1,Costs $10 per month,"WARNING: Unreliable. Stopped working after just three months. At $29, cost was nearly $10/mo plus electricity for a very dim light. For the most expensive light bulb I've ever bought, I expected more. Average bulb life 60,000 hours??? I got about 240 hours out of it at most."
4,Good for the price relative to other LED bulbs,"I ordered 6 of these after reading the other reviews. I was under no illusions that they would be bright, and so was not disappointed that they seem to be about 40 watt equivalents. I installed three in a downstairs bathroom and at first thought that the person who talked about a dim night light was right - then I realized that the bulbs were flowing faintly even thought the light switch was off. If they seem very dim, try turning on the light. Apparently with some (not all) sockets, they require so little power that they glow faintly even when the unit is not actively powered (so my bathroom now has very dim night lights even when the power isn't on). Don't expect bright lights, but especially for multiple bulb units, these make a good compromise until the price of LED bulbs comes down."
1,"Very low output, similar to 20w incandescent, but works with X10 - FAILED AFTER 3months","I use several 40w incandescent bulbs around the house in multi-bulb fixtures - some pointing at art on the walls. This LED unit has about half, or less, light output compared to any of the 40w incandescents. And, as has already been mentioned the color is a harsh blue-white. It does dim with an X10 LM465 Lamp Module, but it stays on very, very dimly when the module is off (probably due to the LM465's sense current). In summary, this unit is only worth being used as a night light, or possibly in a gooseneck fixture 6 inches from your head pointing directly at whatever you may want to read. Also, it does get a bit warm when on - nowhere near as hot as a regular incandescent bulb, but it does not run totally cool.UPDATE: This unit failed after 3 months of use."
4,Good for Reading,"I use this bulb as a bedside reading light, mounted on a flexible arm to aim it. Sufficient for reading, and more efficient than other bulbs. I use CF bulbs elsewhere when more light required."
3,OK but not great,While this book makes good points (like the ten reasons ones life might suck) Cohen gets a bit pendantic for me.
1,Should of realized with the title,"After reading reviews of this book. I (THOUGHT) that it would be really good. Didn't even make it past the first chapter and I was just put off, and disgusted by the way this Author, wrote."
4,Funny and on point,"I flip thru this book when I feel a bad attitude coming on. It's easy to get caught up in negative thinking and start feeling down about things in general and this book shows you many reasons why. This book could be considered 'self-help' and from my own experience in reading tons of self-help books the main theme is this ""although there is a fundamental physical reality we all must contend with--much suffering comes from the way we THINK about things and the context through which we perceive reality.""If you are 'street smart' you probably already know this but we all need some help from time to time finding where our outlook is leading us astray and making our life 'suck'."
2,Starts out okay...,"At first I was enjoying this and thought it was insightful. Then it started to sound repetitive. Then end was just, well, oddly different from the rest of the book. The ending wasted pages and time. Bummer."
3,Will not allow me to go to the next level,I received product lastnight night for my five year old. I hope this is only a glitch. The program will not allow my daughter to go onto the next level in the map. I am going to purchase an older desktop for my daughter and hope it works on it. I think if we fix the glitch this will be an awesome product. I also purchased the I Can Read and The math. Both of the work fine. I am not sure what is going on. I hope it works or they can send me a new one.
1,Not enough information leads to disappointment...,"Didn't know we'd need classic to run this on a mac... which means it won't run on our macs... and we opened the software, which means we can't return it. Waste of money and a disappointed little girl."
2,Reader Rabbit reading,I have not been able to install the installation progam disk...I cannot then use the RR personalized reading program. I have tried it on both my computers and it will not work. I bought the math at the same time and the math installation progam does work.
3,Okay,Bought this for my son along with the Reader Rabbit Math ages 6-9 and the Reader Rabbit I Can Read with Phonics 1st and 2nd grade. The Reading 6-9 and the I can Read 1st and 2nd grade are the exact same program. Literally. I was hoping they'd have different games or something but... they didn't. I was less impressed with this than the math.
4,Reader Rabbit Personalized Reading Ages 6-9 Deluxe,I bought this dvd for my grandaughter and she plays it constantly. She really loves it and it has helped increase her reading skills while having fun at the same time.
4,Freeze up,"Great movie, left us in suspense never saw last 10 minutes movie froze up! Called amazon several times to clear up or find out why it did that, they coulnt figure it out, but refund us"
1,Useless,"Almost half of this book has nothing to do with using Quickbooks, and the half that talks about Quickbooks instructions is shallow and almost useless. Every time something confused me when I tried to decide how to use the Quickbooks features, I looked it up in this book. Half the time there was no information, and the rest of the time the information was less helpful than the instructions that appeared on the Quickbooks screen. I ended up calling my accountant so often, he told me buy a book. When I told him I'd already bought this book, he told me to buy the other bestselling book on Quickbooks , which is the one he used. He was right."
2,Not worth a dime.,"This book was a complete waste of money in that it was a disapointment to the Quickbooks series which is generally reliable. I only paid $1.95 for it and it followed the old adage that you get what you pay for. This was true in this case. After reading it a few times, I placed it in my bookcase and have not touched it since."
2,One bad DVD,"This was a gift to my mother. She told me that two out of the three dvds worked fine, but one wouldn't play. I was very disappointed, since she lives 2,000 miles away from me and it would be difficult to return."
5,Great for young scientists,"I bought this for my son's friend who turned six this summer. He has always shown a strong interest in the human body and after much research this seemed like a super age-appropriate gift to encourage his love of the body. He has loved it. His parents called me to tell me thank you and asked where I got it so they could get him more of the kits from the Magic School Bus series. I bought the one of space for my son and he (and I) have equally loved it and learned a lot. I bought this gift almost 6 months ago and when I was at their house about 3 weeks ago, I noticed he had his poster of the human body (which was a lot larger than I expected it to be) hung up on his wall across from his bed. I would highly recommend this (and any Magic School Bus kit) for any budding young scientists."
2,Salaries Not Current,"If you are purchasing this book to use as a current salary reference, you will be disappointed. Many of the tables show salaries from 1997, some as old as 1995, and many have not been updated since the last edition."
1,looks can be deceiving,"I purchased 2 of these belts for myself and a friend. After the 5th or 6th day, the zipper broke on mine. After the 7th day, the zipper broke on hers as well. It was the same issue with both, the zipper went off the ""track"" and we could not get it back on.Overall, the money belt is pretty discreet and was not uncomfortable. If you decide to purchase this belt, just don't expect it to last a long time!"
2,Amendment to review 9/18/07,"On 9/18/07 I gave this product five stars for design, softness, and comfort. However, when my daughter put it on for her trip overseas, the plastic closure kept popping open, regardless of how tight or how loose we made the adjustment. Maybe this was just a dud, albeit an expensive one, or maybe there's a design flaw. Anyway, the belt is in the U.K. and it would cost more to retrieve it than to buy a different brand. Very disappointing because it was so lovely and soft and suitable in all other respects."
4,For those are really Janis' fan,Great! It's a vintage box covering a career from one of main female singers.I recomend.
1,Please Re-think,"I bought these chairs for my two sons 12 & 13 for Easter. The chairs looked great and the boys really enjoyed them for about 3 weeks when we were sitting in our game room one day and I heard this awful snap. My son was leaning back in the chair playing a video game and suddenly he was on the floor on his back. I unzipped the cover to see why the chair back had broken and couldn't believe my eyes...the chair is made of thick styrofoam. The same stuff disposable coffee cups are made of. What a waste of $$$. The next week the 2nd chair broke the same exact way. The styrofoam must not handle the stress of gamers over any length of time. I suppose if you just sat in them and did not lean back - they might last a full 2 months, better yet don't let anyone sit in them and they'll possibly last until the styrofoam deteriorates. Don't waste your money...I'm glad I'm here to help the next person."
3,Examples hard to read and hard to understand,"As someone else noted, the examples are in tiny type.More seriously, I found the examples to be hard to follow because of overly-similar variable names and unnecessary complexity. Often tries to show several concepts combined in one long example instead of one short example for each.Good concept but trying to cram too much material into too few pages."
2,uhh...lets see,what should i say about this film....certainly not the best Japanese movie i have ever seen. I wont say it was totally confusing...but pretty confusing. i must have lost track when i dozed off for like 5min.... my mom told me when i awoke tht i missed nothing. i was totally bored. and they had a slight twist which was soso. i am giving it two stars simply because it had a small twist and it was by a good director. thankyou for reading!
2,Maybe it's a cultural thing?,"I like Takeshi, which is why I was excited to see a new movie from him. But um..what was this? This was no Ju-on! Was this a movie he did years ago and they brough it out to America hoping to make some money? Actually, that sounds plausible, I'll buy that. If you love Asian horror, or are just getting into it, don't buy this movie. It is NOT scary, it's barely even creepy. The plot is non existant, loose ends are everywhere, and yes, the hand-held camera shots got old, very quickly. Blair Witch is was not. I give it 2 stars because it started off well and had some nice cinematography. As I stated in the title, maybe I just missed something because I don't have an Asian background, maybe the Japanese think it's scary."
2,"Stylish, yet dull and overly predictable.","The film was a disappointment to me. Most of the Tartan previews / commercials did a great job of making this movie look a lot more interesting than it actually was. It was short on intrigue for my taste. I also figured out all of the plot twists early in the film (and I'm typically dim in that regard).The level of surreality in some of the scenes (especially the discovery scene in the sandstone cavern) was refreshing, but those occasional vignettes of oddity were not enough to keep me interested for the whole thing. I promptly sold my copy to the 2nd hand store after viewing.I could see how many people could get 3 stars out of it with fairness. It wasn't abhorrently bad... just bland."
1,Cheap,"Cheap,plastic, broke after 1 day of light play, unable to return due to package being opened, would be better off with a real one"
3,Pretty good mouse but...,"This mouse is very light and nicely sized for the hand. Tracking is very precise. Like many other reviewers of this product, I had to turn my tracking speed down slightly but not excessively.Unfortunately, this thing eats batteries. I had to replace the AAAs within the first month. As others have stated, it loses connection and gets jerky when the charge is low. This is easily solved by replacing the batteries but I just thought I should mention it.All in all I am satisfied with this mouse even with the short battery life. For my next Bluetooth mouse I will get one that is rechargeable by USB."
1,garbage,"Is there any real music comming from North Carolina?All I hear is this pseudo trendy unmelodic crap.Please take music more seriously for the sake of art.Thanks,P carl Lilly"
5,works great,"this car seat is perfect for my 4 year old granddaughter. She likes it too and says its very comfortable, and especially likes the 2 pullout beverage holders."
5,baby face feeling,"I just recieved this product and Ive got to say its the best shaver I have ever used, the lotion makes my face feel super duper clean, so if your looking for a good shaver, this ones for you."
5,Bought in June...great so far.,Bought this for my husband for father's day. He had a very old Norelco that he used occasionally.He loves the new cordless one.
2,"Started off fine, made me nauseous afterwards","While I like Dinty Moore's beef stew, it seems that this is just one product of theirs that I just don't like.The food isn't that appealing- the food was all pale & pasty looking, but looks can be deceiving when it comes to food, so I went ahead & got it anyway. C'mon... ham & potatoes! How can that be ruined?I unfortunately got my answer- you ruin it by loading it up with tons & tons of grease. The first few bites of this weren't bad & I think that if I only had a small portion of it, it wouldn't be such a terrible thing. (Hence the 2 stars rather than 1 star.) I managed to struggle through the bowl (I hate wasting food & had nothing else to eat), but shortly afterwards I just felt sick to my stomach.If you have either a cast iron stomach or you REALLY like food like this, then you'll probably like it. Me? This is just one DM product I'll never be buying again!!"
4,Good read!,I enjoyed this book it is the kind of story that you can enjoy and not have to think about to much you know i nice light read at least for me.
4,"An Interesting, Engaging Read for Children","My second graders LOVED this book. We read it together and it enabled so much great discussion about illness. Children, of course LOVE animals and since we live in Southern California and not too terribly far from the Ocean and Sea World, many of the children have seen turtles. We couldn't believe how large Carolina was! The illustrations were superb. The information was age-appropriate and these books are so educational! They include other information you can use in the classroom (would be really awesome for homeschoolers too!) The appropriate age for this book is: 4-9 The Accelerated Reading Level is: 3.6"
1,plastic and hard as a rock,i really do not know where they get beefy as this is so hard it would break the teeth of any dog in my opinioni would not buy this again and sorry i wasted money on it
2,not as pictured,"bought this as a gift for my godson....was to be framed, but delivered product has a big ""made from RECYCLED materials"" stamp in the middle of the map.....like the sentiment, but it ruined the look of the product! I returned it."
4,Rare Earth Elements (REEs) in the Context of Their Basic Properties,"It is not surprising that this book was put out by Ames Laboratory in Iowa, as this lab has been involved in REE-related research for several decades. This book centers on the chemical and physical properties of REEs. Because it is old (1961), it can be used for purposes of comparison with more modern approaches. For instance, the chapters on the separation of REEs can be compared with modern methods of REE extraction.There are chapters on REE fluorides and halides. Other chapters cover the crystallography, metallography, and alloying behaviors of REEs. Still other chapters may be of historical interest--including the one on uses of REEs. These early uses have been superseded by countless new uses in recent decades!"
4,Turkey Hunting Tactics,"Turkey Hunting Tactics has proven to be a very good reference for various aspecs of turkey hunting. It made for very good e-reading in my deer blind toward the end of deer season. The only drawback for an e-reader is that the pictures weren't of very much use. This book helped me transition to a turkey hunting mindset and helped me develop my turkey hunting strategy. To use the old saying ""the proofs in the pudding"", two days into turkey season and two nice Tom's are in the bag. If there were only one word of advice that I could give to a novice turkey hunter it would be ""scout"".Link to amature video of one of the hunts (8AM 3-25-12 Southeast Georgia): [...]"
3,"it is cool, but it could use more songs",Nick Carter is the hottest babe in the whole world. Anyone who thinks anything else well go to heck!!
5,Gave me courage and power to be strong,"This book gave me the courage to stay away from the abusiveness. There was something about having a third person and reading it in black and white that turned the light on for me. My guy was an expert at manipulating and turning what I said around to make me think I was nuts! When I read that over and over in Bancroft's book, I felt empowered and finally liberated to stay away. It has been a few weeks, he's still trying to make contact, but I feel strong. Thank you Mr. Bancroft for writing this book! I have it in hard back and on my Kindle!"
5,Excellent book for women in controlling and abusive relationships,"For professionals, educators, or for more in-depth analysis, see The Batter as Parent (2nd edition) by Bancroft, Silverman, & Ritchie [...]"
5,This book changed my life!,"after reading this book in about 3 days, i decided to leave my home with our 16 year old. it was very hard, family court was involved, the cops, etc. but in the end i am back home he is out and i am very happy; so is my child. finally peace! one note of advise for anyone out there considering leaving...DO NOT GIVE UP RIGHTS TO YOUR HOME..have the authorities remove HIM from the home, even if you decide to not stay at the house for a few days, once you tell the court you dont want to go back home it will be very very difficult to regain rights to live there!"
5,why does he do that?,this book opened my eyes to what i lived for years. i would recommend it for anyone living through emotional abuse.
5,Great Book for anyone who has ever been in an abusive relationship.,Great Book for anyone who has ever been in an abusive relationship. Explains their thinking in ways you have never thought of. But it still doesn't give you much hope for change. Men who are abusive seem to be wired differently than the rest of us. :-(
4,Very Well Written,This book is an important read for anybody trying to come to grips with the confusion surrounding Angry and controlling men.
5,A must read for everybody,"I wish I could have written this book. I am a professional working in the area of domestic violence though my experience does not approach that of Mr. Bancroft. Bancroft has covered the subject of abusers in a way that I have never before seen. I strongly recommend this book to everybody, male as well as female. Give it to your daughters, encourage them to read it and discus it. It could save a life.Before writing this review I read many of the previous reviews, particularly the few very negative ones. The negative reviews seemed quite defensive and exhibited some of the characteristic of abusers discussed by Bancroft. Interesting."
4,A good sound effects CD.,"This album gave me a lot of sound effects that I needed. The sounds are mainly mechanical, man made type things (machinery). Most of the effects sound like the real thing and are very clear. Not much else can be said of a sound effects album."
1,Not for commercial purposes.,"It's just as you've read: in the Terms of Use, once you've clicked on an item, it says that it's for personal use only, NOT for commercial purposes. So, know what you're purchasing..."
1,Hasn't been touched in over a week.,I always have great luck with bird seed bells. I put a ribbon on them and throw them up in the tree. This bell has been hanging perfectly in my tree for over a week. No one has touched it. The weather has been perfect and the birds have been making tons of noise out there. So what gives? Why don't they like this?
2,Picuture looks different than actual product,"I purchased these shoes for a great price on Amazon. When the shoes arrived, they did not look like the picture. The shoes are very ""pointy"" almost to the point of looking like womens shoes."
1,ATROCIOUS!!!,"I agree with all the negative reviews: save your money! As a Diana Ross fan since her days as a Primette, I am mystified that there has never been an official release of any of her solo concerts (Central Park anyone?) or the many great shows she did with the Supremes (the final concert at the Frontier Hotel?). What gives, Diana? Berry? Whoever owns the Motown catalog these days? Having collected this concert in every format that it has appeared in since VHS, I can say with complete confidence that this DVD is the WORST; it's so awful that it might as well be Freddie Poole on the stage. The laser disc (remember those?) has the best version of this concert and there is a Brazilian all-region DVD that's almost as good. Keep moving and happy hunting!"
2,Ain't Been Licked----or have I?,"Price is right if you don't have this one already, from the GOOD OLD MOTOWN 1900's! BUT, I was disappointed right from the very beginning...the grand royal announcing blaring and declaring horns are missing from the MOUNTAIN HIGH ENOUGH opening, as are the exterior shots of Caesars Palace/Las Vegas, and the huge DIANA ROSS on the marquee. For a dvd, the quality is NOT there as well.....blurry and grainy. But again, since MOTOWN or DIANA won't release any of this old stuff......I guess SOMETHING IS BETTER THAN NOTHING. Make this world a better place, if YOU can.....do YOU know? AND.....who is pictured in white on the back cover?"
1,not a new concert...,WOW CANNOT BELIEVE YOU ARE TOUTING THIS AS A NEW DVD...IT IS 30 YEARS OLD.......WHAT A WASTE OF DVD SPACE...COME ON SHE JUST HAD A VERY SUCCESSFUL TOUR...COULDNT HAVE FILMED THAT?
4,Practical wisdom,"I can't imagine where the reviewer was coming from who trashed this book and referred to it as ""Spilled Esotericism"" and a ""parlor game."" Margaret Frings Keyes is a respected psychotherapist who uses the Enneagram in intelligent and therapeutic ways, yet also offers practical ideas for people in everyday life to break free of unhealthy patterns. She is certainly of the same caliber as other authors writing on the subject."
1,Spilled Esotericism,"The decision to allow esoteric traditions to become widely available is not in itself a mistake; sometimes the prudent choice is to hide valuable knowledge in a public place. But the consequences will usually include a merchandising of the information at the level of a parlor game by persons whose consciousness is dominated by what Eckhart called ""merchant-mindedness."" Those with serious interests in spirituality should consult the work of Helen Palmer, Claudio Naranjo, Oscar Ichazo, Sandra Maitri, and A. H. Almaas."
5,Gotta Love Ringo!,"My son and I went to see Ringo and his all Star Band when he played this summer in San Diego! These DVD captures some of the great rock musicians that played with him and their special songs. No matter how old I get, I will always remember listening to ""Dreamweaver"" that summer night - and the DVD reminds me of that night so much!"
4,Navey Peacoat,"the jacket was wonderful but it is a gift and it's much too big so I have to return it. I will try to replace it with a coat that is the correct size. It took a long time to get the coat in the first place, however... there was horrible weather all over the country and we were snowed in so I suspect that was the reason."
1,High Risk for Toddler Head Injuries,"This chair is so light that it falls over when the toddler tries to sit down on it. Toddler age babies are just beginning to climb and will frequently climb up onto the chair prior to sitting. As the baby holds onto the back of the chair for support, the chair flips backwards, carrying the baby down hard to the floor. Even when not causing the baby to fall, the chair is so light that it is never upright when the toddler wants to sit down."
3,Good Historical Account,"This part 2 of the series was not nearly as comprehensive and informative as the first book...but still a worthwhile investment if you have the first book...I felt that it left me wanting more...More information, more photos, more documents (like the first book did...it might have been helpful to have had more old newpaper clippings, or articles written during the period, journal entrys, letters, etc. The content should be commensurate with the price...I personally felt, it wasn't. Again, it left me wanting more."
3,an interesting study of the doppelganger in literature,"The subtitle of this book is a misnomer since Paul Coates includes romanticist E.T.A. Hoffmann in his study of the doppelganger or double in literature. Perhaps this book was too hastily written since one comes away with from it with an incomplete sense of the subject. Coates is also unaware of some great doppelganger stories that should have been in his book: Poe (""The Tell-Tale Heart"" ""The Black Cat""), Paul Bowles (""You are Not I"" ""Allal"") and Julio Cortazar (""The Distances""). Nevertheless, those interested in the subject will find this short study often perceptive."
3,I find nothing attractive in a stupid hero,First off let me just say that I love her writing style - it is fun and witty and very entertaining. I was really getting into it until the hero thinks about being beat up when he was young for being stupid and that his father thought he was stupid and yes we learn through his actions that he is indeed not the brightest bulb out there. First off he burns the notes that could have been possible clues and he can't understand half the things that Anna is talking about. He just reminded me of a big dumb puppy dog. I think if she left out the part that Rein wasn't very smart this book would have been 5 stars since he would have turned out to be a charming hero I can't understand why she felt the need to make her character dumb. I just can't imagine a smart girl like Anna truly being happy in the long run with Rein. Also why was this book called scandal? We never see the character do anything scandalous.
5,KING IS KING,"ERIC CLAPTON SHOULD NOT EVEN BE QUOTED IN A REVIEW ON THIS MAN. HES NOT A PIMPLE ON FREDDIES 'FACE'. THIS VIDEO IS A MUST HAVE! FOR THOSE OF US WHO LIKE 'REAL' BLUES, NOT ERIC 'PRUNEFACE' CLAPTON 'BLUES'. :)"
2,not perfect,"I got this three weeks ago, when it arrived the package looked so good which was in a hard cardboard tube but when I opened it the corner was rip, so called to get replacement, the second one come with the same problem. Too tired to keep get exchange."
5,Awsome! Full of a different kind of magic.,"First you need a small summary to understand where I am coming from in this review.This book is about two girls a 3rd grader Hillary and a 5th grader Sara-Kate.No one really likes Sara-Kate. Everybody makes fun of her because of how strange she is , her rundown house, and her clothes.Until one day something extraordinary happens and Hillary and Sara-Kate become friends. Soon Hillary discovers Sara-Kate's secret. Then things take a sharp turn for the worst. I liked this book because it is very different than every other book I've ever read.I liked it because of what a good friend is to Sara-Kate. This story is full of mystery , friendship , and surprise.It opens a whole new world for people. I recommend this book for everyone not just children."
3,TOO Complicated,"I got this book along with MAC OS X ""The Missing Manuel"", and I use that book more then the Bible. The Bible has some good things in it, but it is sometimes hard to understand, and I don't like the layout as well."
4,Helpful Towards Certification,My first step for any certification is always a Dummies book. I find them well written and helpful to get me started... and this book was no exception. I did find a few mistakes and wrong information but that's been my experience with every certification book I've ever bought. This is a good book and well worth the money.
2,not recommended,"very disappointing because of the overuse of rhetorical flourishes, the inane contrasts between ""science"" and ""philosophy,"" the talking down to the listener as if the lecturer is a nerd doing a poor job of trying to be one of the guys.....I have to admit that it picks up in the 3rd and 4th lectures, but it lacks clarity and fails completely to explain much of the material introduced.....disclaimer: I have only listened to the first 4 lectures, will probably watch the rest, but without enthusiasm, while looking for better material on this subject......and, the booklet accompanying the course does have useful bibliography after each lecture."
2,retractable leads,The case on one of the leads came apart within about two to three weeks. The other one is still in tack but now I don't trust it.
4,"An Excellent Start, Anti-Climatic Ending","Michael does an excellent job at the start of his book. Like many other readers, I was unable to put this piece down. Though""radical"" as always, Moore makes some excellent points on what we as commoners should be doing to steer our country back into the right direction of honesty and back to a place where our personal rights matter. The latter half of the book was somewhat of a disappointment, but Moore's humor kept it amusing to say the least."
2,Disappointing,"First let me preface by saying that I'm a big fan of Michael Moore. I loved Roger and Me, Stupid White Men, and Bowling For Columbine. I feel those represent the very best of what Michael Moore has to offer; honesty, humor, information, etc. But I have to admit that I was severly disappointed (and confused) by this book, mainly because I had been waiting so long for it, and it turned out to be a major let down. It seems almost like Mike has become a parody of himself with this book. At times I couldn't tell if he was trying to be outrageous, or if I'm just really out of touch. Maybe Mike has been living the past couple of years in a parallel universe, who knows. In short I'll still probably buy all of his stuff and go see his movies, but this one was disappointing."
1,I'm smarter than this,"I read my uncles copy while visiting him last weekend. Although I am only 12, I can spot a mean spirited person a mile away. Where does he get off that getting rich in this country is impossible and that you might as well give up? I read up on Michael Moore. He's rich. He also doesn't have a very good reputation with former employees, is notoriously cheap, doesn't even tip etc. Just the kind of role model we need for this country. Plus all the 9/11 stuff? Oh brother. I have chosen this book for a book report. The assignment is to find a political themed book, present the contents, summarize and then give an opinion. I cannot give it my recommendation. Its just more inaccurate propaganda from this buy. I am sure many people will buy it and make him richer. What a hypocrite. He reminds me of all those foaming at the mouth conservatives talk show guys. He's just another self promoter getting rich off of movie and book deals. A gas bag. My best friend thinks he's a doofus."
1,More lies from Moore,"Sometimes I also wonder where my country is when I see that this pack of lies has reached # 1 in the best-sellers list. With unsubstantiated theories, this raving pseudo-socialist idiot has managed to achieve the status of political genius among people even dumber than he is. Borrow it from the library (don't give this stupid white millionaire more money)if you really want to waste your time. It's not even funny."
1,Very Sad Fiction from an Angry Liberal,I feel sorry for Moore. Seems he can't let go of the glory years. This is such a slanted and biased account it would be laughable if it weren't so sad. Mike and those like him are fading into the sunset and it's hard for them to accept. Don't waste you time with this one.
1,Moore has lost his sense of reality.,"It's ashame to see Michael Moore loose his credibility because of his obsession with the Bush family. Although he is known for twisting the truth for humorous effect he goes to far here. He's become so single minded in his effort to become the left-wing Rush Limbaugh that he's starting to suceed.As Nieche said ""Each man becomes the thing he hates ...""If you enjoy blaming the president of the US for everything as much as Rush did in the 90s than you'll love this book."
1,"Moore Is Canadian: Uneducated, Poor, Jealous, AntiCapitalism","This book rates up there with Erich Von Daniken's ""Chariots of the Gods: Unsolved Mysteries of the Past"" So filled with fun facts. Even the cover art comes close to the publications ""Weekly World News"" and Tiger Beat!"" Thank goodness! If it didn't have such cool pictures, I wouldn't have read it! The only thing missing were horoscopes and cross-word puzzles at the end of the book. For that I couldn't give it 5 stars!It's a good thing to see such a high class during this time of political bashing. It's a great breath of fresh air."
1,Mindless Liberal Dribble,"This is an excellent book...to prop up a wobbly table or to use starting a fire. Moore rambles on and while he may make a valid point (that is bipartisan), he quickly makes the reader forget about it by going on another personal rant about how bad we have it in America. Michael Moore hates America! He is not an asset to our country, rather he is a traitor and should be treated as one. This book itself is an excellent piece of evidence that could be used. Do not read this book, for you will be wasting your time. Instead, try something a little less liberal."
1,Thank God I didn't buy this book,"This is liberal propaganda at its best. Demonizing the successful, bashing Bush and reliving the sex filled days of the Clinton years. What Moore seems to not realize its big buisness that pays us working people, not the Mom & Pop stores that hire part time, miniumum wage jobs, which the democrates are so fond of. Looking out for big buisness is looking out for the working class. He forgets what made this Country great, Free Enterprise. The idea you punish the rich, sounds great to the less fortunate but without rewards for people taking risk you lose all incentive to succeed, why start a buisness when your reward is paying all your fruits of profit in taxes? Mr. Moore doesn't understand what the working class goes through, he is only a slave to his idealogical tainted views."
3,Theres other books thats more fulfilling...,If you read around the internet about his critics you would see the mistakes he made in the book. The movie he created was great until i heared all the mistakes he made with that too. Lies and the Lying liars was much better.
1,And some people think he's a hero,This man is seriously missguided and wishes nothing more than to become famous (and rich) by misleading as many other people as he can.
4,Inspiring and Awesome read!,"Easy book to read, with Michael's straight shooting no-nonsense style. Great analysis and data to back the statements and thoughts - so it's not baseless ranting.The world needs more Michael Moores - honest people who truly love their country and speak up to defend our civil liberties, and he does this in a candid and transparent way. Creating awareness of these cronyism/lies/problems are critical for people's opinion to swing...and ultimately vote for a leader who won't use fear against us. I am surpised that even for a country with free speech the media has been pretty one-sided (big Brother controlled). If you think this is bad in America...other parts of the world could have had locked someone like Michael behind bars under the guise of national security!Like Michael said - your country's just out there - bring it home."
5,An informative eye-opener,"Don't pay attention to those giving this book low ratings. They do that because they're afraid of the attention Michael Moore is getting. All along, the right-wing tries to drown out the left by labeling them traitors and communists. This book rises above all that nonsense and actually raises very important theories regarding 9/11/01 and the second war in Iraq, amongst other things. The good thing about this book is that it doesn't throw out false accusations. A lot of theories raised in this book are not actually theories at all but information drawn from newspaper articles written by respectable, established, trustworthy reporters. Don't deprive yourself of the truth! Read this book!"
2,michael moore's 180,"This book has some funny moments, even makes a few great points; however, if you have read stupid white men, you will see that michael moore has done a 180 and changed from an outsider who sees the need to change the corrupt two party system in America to a Democratic party puppet. Put plainly, the book is a democratic party propoganda pamphlet.Visit VOTENADER.ORG-Justin Flores"
1,Moore Anger,"This book is often funny but it treats conservatives unfairly. Just like Democrats, Republicans are most often good people but with a different philosophy about government, and any other portrayal of them is simply dishonest. Dems can call Reps ""Greedy"" and Reps can call Dems ""Commies"" but that does not change the fact they simply disagree on how to do things. I think Michael Moore would have been better off simply sharing his views without having to slam the opposition. By relying so much on the demonization of the other side, it makes his own arguments less effective. If Moore is correct, shouldn't his ideas be able to stand alone?"
1,"By a nitwit, for nitwits","Moore has come to take himself far to seriously. He appears to have developed a Christ complex. Most of this book is gibberish, where ad hominem attacks pass for rational argument. This sort of trash is an embarrassment to true progressives and liberals. Moore is more concerned with narcissistic self promotion than helpful analysis.Do not buy this book. Do not steal this book. Spend your money on someone who actually has something other to say than, ""Look at me!!!?"
1,A total waste of time and paper,"Yet another fantasy from the king of misinformation, similar to ""Bowling for Columbine"". Michael Moore needs to back up his work with some factual information if he wants to be credible, so far this is not the case. His left wing vitriol is totally unbelievable, don't waste your money! There should be a ""0 stars"" rating available for this book."
1,Lousy!!,"I read this book merely to find out if Michael Moore had learned from the bad reviews from his last book about how to write intelligently. His style is unorganized and cannot separate emotion from logic. Undoubtedly, he has had success in appealing to some of the uneducated masses, which is why he and a mediocre comedian (Al Franken) have recently become the most recognizable spokesmen for the liberal point of view. This book clearly demonstrates why the liberal media has fallen so far behind the conservative media."
1,All you need to know Mike,"Here are some things he needs to come to terms with:1. We live in a capitalist society that has a high value on capital (money, wealth). Smart people are better at amassing wealth than uneducated people, thus people with money call the shots.2. There are unethical people in any field of life. Corporations are not to blame.3. Certain bodies hate our country, and have vowed to terrorize it. If Iraq has nothing to do with Al Qaeda, why are they so angry that we are there, and why are they threatening more attacks?4. Osama bin Laden would have your head as zealously as he would have George W. Bush's, so wake up. It's not about consevatives and liberals, it's about AMERICANS.You only make our country look more divided and foolish."
1,Michael Moore is a propagandist,"He basically admits to this when he sees how others catch his lies and 'adjusts' his 'documentaries' to be still false, yet differently.This book is just more of the same. Lie about Bush, lie about what Bush says and does, repeat the lies of those who oppose Bush.All you need to know about Moore is this: his early days were spent whining about GM closing a factory in Flint, Michigan and ""leaving people without jobs"". (Were they helpless?!)So now that Moore is worth millions, does he live in Flint? Of course not! Why aren't you providing jobs in Flint, Michigan, Mr. Moore?!Shame! SHAME! SHAME!!!!!"
5,A Very Enlightening Read,"This book has opened my eyes to what I have always felt and that is the censorship of the news to Americans is real and happening everyday. The contents is backed with facts that are documented at the end. Mr. Moore uses a light hearted, comical way of making his point and getting the reader to see the dubious tactics of the Bush administration and his followers. The information makes you upset and at intervals I had to put the book down to cool off. However it is amazing that intelligent Americans would allow the Bush administration to get away with so much underhanded policies and lies. This book is very hard on the Bush Administration and its policies toward war, economy, and environment and I am sure those that love Bush will hate this book. I find it very revealing and hopefully after reading this book Americans will ask questions about the conduct of the Republicans and their leader George Bush."
5,Some light in the darkness,"In a society so overwhelmed with half-truths, open lies and indifference, this book is like fresh air. Not only tells us in a funny and deep way things we ought to know and usually don't, but also calls our attention to important things we tend to forget.Ocassionaly stretched out, must mostly pretty accurate and clear.Bravo!"
5,All Americans need to read this book,A very funny and factually backed book. As a non American it's shocking to see how duped you lot are by your politicans and media; but more so how you are ready to believe the spin and not question the spin. YOU NEED MORE PEOPLE LIKE MR MOORE. Stop being like dumb sheep and follow his example and question your Government/Media's actions.
2,Great Fiction,Many opinions backed by few facts. I give it two stars for good fiction. People who read this book amd believe it should do a little research. Don't be blind.
4,dude.,"Michael Moore has balls taking on the evils, and he once again proves so in his newest ""Dude, where's my country?""I enjoyed this as I have most of his work, he makes excellent, and might I say factual (and researched) points. I especially enjoy his closing vision of our presidential occupant being removed via handcuffs.On the negative, the book felt ""rushed"" in that it is fairly brief, and has some far too similar elements to other books on the same subject. Of course understandably there is due to be some redundancy on the issues...I also felt there could of been more of a thorough thrashing of the bush regime.Overall worth reading, educational and funny."
3,Good Politics; Lazy Writing,"I agree with Michael Moore's politics. I just feel that ""Dude, Where's My Country"" contains way too much ""filler ranting"" as I like to call it. ""Stupid White Men"" seemed to contain many more frightening facts and touched on a broader range of issues. If you've read ""Stupid White Men,"" I suggest upgrading to something like Chomsky. This is a bit light in the content department.And for the conservatives who keep posting dummy reviews just to change the book's overall review score: please get a clue. You are entitled to your opinion but when you come off as being lazy and stupid, you only perpetuate the stereotype that conservatives are lazy and stupid. Present your point of view responsibly or no one will bother listening to it."
4,Fascinating book!,"I had always sensed there was something fishy going on with the September 11 tragedy, and then the Iraq war...... this is nothing like a conspiracy theory or anything farfetched, Michael Moore just did a great job of digging deep, connecting the missing pieces of the puzzle, and solving the mystery for us. People bash him, but as yet I don't think anyone has refuted the facts. Call him a liberal, but facts are still facts. Very enjoyable book!"
3,More Agenda Pushing,"I have read a lot of these reviews. ""Yeah for Michael Moore AND Liberals!"" is what I see here. The book is OK at best. MM again tells some truths and some PARTS of truths that make his point. Again no reasonable answers are given to problems. He is, again, the little fat kid on the sidelines acting like an ass to get attention. If MM wants to cut down on all the accesses of American life he should start at his own dinner table. He is the perfect example of what he claims to hate. So...all you young liberals remember to take this book with a grain of salt. It is entertainment with FEW actual FULL facts included. MM is rich, arrogant, and excessive. He should be in the White House...he would fit right in with his ""enemies""."
2,Read Stupid White Men instead!,"I usually like Moore's work. But, I found this book to be completely boring. Maybe as I struggled so early in the book (ch. 2 Home of the Whopper) to stay awake.To me it just seems like Mike rushed out a book so he could get his thoughts in on the Iraq War. Whether you agree with his politics or not, I do, that is what this book seems to me. Rushed.Do yourselves a favor and go read, or re-read, Stupid White Men instead.Just my humble opinion."
