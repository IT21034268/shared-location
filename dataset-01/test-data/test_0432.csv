4,THE KUMBIA KINGS ARE ON THERE WAY!,THERE POPULARITY WILL CONTINUE TO GROW. THEY REALLY HAVE NOT EVEN BEGIN TO SCRATCH THE SURFACE OF THE TEJANO AND INTERN. MUSIC SCENE. WE CAN ONLY WAIT TO SEE IF THEY ARE AS GOOD LIVE AS THEY ARE ON TAPE. GOOD LUCK FELLAS....
4,The Book about Q-10,This book gave a good explanation of what Coenzyme Q-10 is. It also provided great information on how it is used in our cells and how important it is to have a balance of this otherwise it can lead to heart problems.
5,A Wonderfully Relaxing CD!!!,This was a wonderful CD collection of artistically put together tracks that incorporate the sounds of nature. I found this collection to be a great relaxation tool since I received it.Bradley Powell is a very talented artist and his work on this CD is an apt demonstration of what he is capable of. I highly recommend this CD. A must have in todays stressful world.
1,I paid it but I never received it,"Dear Amazon, I paid for this but until today I did not received it, I wrote to the supplier and until today I did not received any answer from him."
2,Misleading...,"After listening to their excellent remix of Air's ""Sexy Boy"" Cassius left a great impression on me. Being a HUGE Air fan (no pun intended) I decided to check them out, because if Air likes them, I'd probably like them, too. So i waited quite a few months until ""1999"" came out and i bought it. I was DEEPLY disappointed.The ""sexy boy"" remix they did was absolutly wonderful, but ""1999"" was awful. I listen to this CD once then threw it on my shelf. When i get bored I TRY to listen to it and its still bad! Idon't know what happenend, but stick with Daft Punk, people."
1,go back to the ephedra pills,"I thought I would try this (bought it before the ephedra ban was lifted in April) since it was in my cupboard. I have taken it 2 days now and both days I have been sick to my stomach about 5 hours after taking it. I didnt even take full strength yet. Not a good way to curb the appetite. Go back to the diet pills with ephedra in them, they are excellent, I usually lost 1/2 pound per day on those. Spend your money on something else."
2,They sent me these brown tablets nd not capsules!!,i ordered from this company expecting to get real lipovairn yet they sent me some fake lipovarin tablets!! what is this stuff!?!?! no wonder why they can sell cheap.....the stuff is FAKE!! I should of read the previous reviews before ordering....
4,Like The Product,Lipovarin is a good weight loss product. It has helped me for sure the past 3 weeks. A little bit pricey though and each bottle lasts for about a month. I am on a fixed income.
1,Terrible,Tried this after reading and researching it. The reviews were very compelling but did not work as well for me as I read.
5,love this product!,"this works great in reducing my hunger, I don't even need to take the suggested dose, It works just as effectivly when I take just one or two the whole day. I took the bottle into a GNC and the associate read the ingredients and said it's a good product with lots of benefits. I would highly reccomend."
1,Did... absolutely NOTHING!!!,"I was persuaded by the positive reviews to think that this pill might actually help decrease my appetite and increase my energy.It didn't make me jittery, which is rare for a diet pill. Instead, it did... NOTHING at all! What a waste. Didn't affect my cravings or energy level at all. Waste of money!"
3,Did wonders for my appetite,"Havent lost as much as I expected but it certainly helped decrease my appetite. I'm having trouble sticking to a healthier way of eating, I gues that's my personal problem."
1,doesn't work on me,well~ i am lazy and i didn't do much exercise after i started to use the product and I gained about 5 pounds -_-lll
2,made me very dizzy,"I had to quit taking this after 3 days, I thought the dizziness would go away but it made me not only dizzy but sick to my stomach. I followed the directions exactly, but I guess it wasn't made for me. Hope it works for you."
3,Adrian Shaw - 'String Theory' (Woronzow),"Personally, I think I liked Shaw's efforts 'Look Out' and 'Head Cleaner' a little more (see my reviews of both). Only way I could describe this CD is maybe 'distinctive psych' which would MEAN that it's not for everyone. Unless you liked the two CD's I've just mentioned, you might want to listen to sound bites of this disc where provided, first. Tracks here that I was semi-impressed with were ""Thirty Two"", the well-written ""Lost For Words"" and the oddly arrainged 18-minute ""Saving Grace"" (maybe this disc's best tune)."
3,Cheap knock-off...,"I bought for my sons room, as we had already decorated the room with camoflauge attire. I was under the impression that this wall plate was painted, but to my disappointment it is a cheap sticker over a normal white plate. Very easy to peal off, just by mounting it..."
2,"Neat, pretty, pretty inaccurate","It's pretty, shiny and neat to look at.I don't mind it's not an inertial autowinder, but the accuracy is not even close to a sundial or an hour candle.The band hasn't held up well. ""What do you expect for $XX?"" is the next thought.Anyhow, it's so-so."
2,Read the return policy,"This is a very valuable lesson, I learned when purchasing a watch for my husband from this vendor. I needed to return the watch, not only was there a restocking fee, but a percentage of money was taken off the item as well. No gift and lost money. Never again."
5,Another Five Star for Pandora,"Great songs, great singing, what more could you ask for? An excellent follow-up album to Volume 1 of Amor Eterno."
2,This is a frustrating book,"For those looking to take their Flash skills from beginner to intermediate status this book covers a lot of topics to help get you there such as OOP with AS 2.0, components, extending Flash, XML, and using Flash with server-side technologies. However, it is full of errors including typos and erroneous code. The latter problem is compounded by a corresponding lack of web suppport as other reviewers have pointed out. If this book had been edited and proofread more vigorously it could have been a great product for helping beginning Flashers take their skills to the next level."
5,Bandito rocks,"We had a dinner party consisting of teenagers, grandparents, parnts and young adults. We played this game after dinner and everyone was engaged and excited to play. It is sometimes hard to find a game that engages different age groups and this one does.Hats off to Bandito."
5,Want to hear it,"I have the other two by allen, mishap and HMM... both are awesome. Gave the stars based on them.Looks like I need to go to cdbaby dot com to get it, come on amazon!"
2,Pretty poor writing,"I bought this as an airplane read (actually, going to Paris) and while it occupied some of my travel I think I might have become less intelligent after reading this. I almost get the feeling that the author is someone who is actually pretending they are a young woman who worked in fashion and moved to France--it just read as such an in genuine story to me. The narrator was jokesy, not self-aware, and vapid, and the entire book read like a long blog entry written by a teenage boy pretending to be an adult woman in a mocking tone. Not recommended unless (like me) you are stuck on a long flight with nothing else to turn to."
3,My husband likes this...I don't,"My husband swears by this lotion for any sunburns he has... I'm not a big fan of it.My husband says it helps with healing his burns and help to moisturize as well. He typically doesn't use lotion for any reason, so if this is the one that will get him to use some, I guess I shouldn't complain.For me, the smell is off. We've had a couple bottles of it and they all smell the same. I just don't like it and don't want to smell like it. Also, it's a bit greasy and heavy for me. I stick with Lubriderm or Cetaphil for lotion and if I am burned, I'll just use those. I don't think there is enough aloe in the lotion to really make a huge difference."
1,No repair parts support,"Purchased this light 6 years ago. Warranty is for 5 years. Electric eye failed and light does not work properly in any mode. Contacted Heath-Zenith with this problem and the reply is that they don't sell ANY repair parts, sorry for the problem. When I looked through the original paperwork that came with the light, it says plain as day, NO REPAIR PARTS AVAILABLE. I guess Heath-Zenith thinks I will purchase another light for replacement but that ain't gonna happen."
5,Great Light,"I was looking for a nice outdoor wall light with motion detection to replace a really old back patio light. I checked the local home improvement retail stores and all the low priced stuff either looked ugly, or didn't have motion detect. There was some higher-priced stuff that wasn't bad, but I decided to look online, and I'm glad I did. This light looks great, has motion detection, and has the dusk-to-dawn feature so it turns on automatically at a dim level when it gets dark out, and it turns on brighter when motion is detected. That's just what I was looking for. It's priced reasonably, installed easily, and the dusk-to-dawn feature and motion detection work perfectly."
3,Full of pranks,It is April Fools Day in Sweet Valley and Jessica has planned her biggest trick ever.Watch out for a twist in the end!
5,What an incredible BAND,"Well it's been a long time in the making but that wait has been justified! What a great box set. The sound is incredible, its so crisp you'd swear they are in the room with you. And yes I said ""THEY!"" Come on people, lets not forget that this was Stephen's band and that Richie is one of the all time great voices in rock. All I seem to read is how great Neil's work is here and I concure, he is truly a giant, however, don't short sell the others. Bruce Palmer was an extrodinary bass player, Dewey Martin was a fantastic drumer, Jimmy Messina a great producer/engineer/bass player and all together they combined to make a wonderful sound. Thanks Neil for taking the time to make this classic. I can't wait for the Archieves."
1,Love Buffalo S. Hate Crass commercialism,"1st there are a lot of demos which are never better than the finished songs on the original albums. 2nd there is a dreadful repeat of songs which are suppose to be better in mono (i didnt notice any diff.) on the 4th disc which is suppose to be bonus, how is it bonus as it comes with the puchase. 4th the incredible almost 9 minute version of Bluebird was not included (inexcusable error/oversight). 5th their Live shows are meant to be legendary so why no live material as thats what true fans are hankering for. 6th Most fans would already only own all the B.S. albums & possibly the double comp. album (with the 9 minute version of Bluebird). The extra rare completed songs would perhaps almost make 1 c.d. of rarities which would be a better addition to our B.S. collections than an expensive hefty box set. This was an incredible opportunity squandered & a disappointing venture which seemed only designed to make money & annoy true Buffalo fans."
2,What a rip off!,"This box set is a blatant commercial release by the record company and an embarrasment to the Buffalo Springfield. Yes, the set contains some great songs, but any casual fan who already has the Springfield's ""Retrospective"" album, would be wasting money on this mess. As has already been mentioned by other reviewers, it would be better and more cost effective to purchase the Springfield's first four albums."
4,At Long Last,"This Buffalo Springfield boxed set finally pulls together almost all the fabled songs that were recorded yet never released, along with compelling alternative takes and early demos. Lots of great surprises, including ""Down, Down, Down"" which eventually morphs into ""Broken Arrow,"" an early acoustic version of ""Hung Upside Down"", and various takes on ""Flying on the Ground is Wrong."" Neil Young's songwriting genius really shows.I docked it one star for not including the extended and legendary version of ""Bluebird"" found on their early 1970s 2-LP anthology (long out-of-print), featuring jamming guitars versus the banjo close we are used to. Another fault is the lack of background on the songs themselves, relying instead on a period piece, fan magazine type booklet that resembles the ""Last Time Around"" album artwork."
2,Overblown but hardly definitive,"See, the thing about demos & outtakes is they are rough drafts or works in progress which make nice filler or bonus material. That said, buy the 3 individual CDs. They've been nicely remastered & reasonably priced. The 1st album even has the mono version of the album included(preferred by the band members) along with the stereo format. If this had contained all 3 albums in their entirety plus the extended version of ""Bluebird"", this could've been a 5 star comp. Then, a third or 4th disc could've been tacked on to please the diehards."
5,I Love Roller Coasters,"This video is so cool! I was expecting it to just show roller coasters and how fast they go, but no.....it gives you the whole history of roller coasters!It shows you:-Roller coaster safety-Why you can't fall out of a loop-Gravity....and much moreThis video is great for any kid at any age!"
1,Piece of junk!,The numbers this shows are all calculated when you input your information. So it has nothing to do with holding it at all. There are numerous sites online that will give you the same info for free. This gave me the same readings if I was standing holding it at 90 degrees or laying down in the bed or if I just put the tips of my fingers on it. Doesn't matter. Save your money and just use an online site.
3,"Well built, but gives inconsistent readings","I bought this product to help me track my fat loss. That being said it often gives inconsistent readings. In a span of 2 minutes it would range +/- .6% from previous readings. I will take 4-5 readings and average them, using the average as final calculation.I know this isn't the best way to test BF%, but I was hoping it to be more consistent."
2,Doesn't work for unusual body types,"Well, I'm sure this would be an awesome and cool device when it works. And it does work - that is, if your body falls within a certain range of body types, shapes, weights. Being a paraplegic, my legs have long atrophied, and I'm about 40 pounds under the weight at which the Omron will even calculate body fat for someone of my height (5'10). And, as far as I can tell, there's no mention of this anyway in the marketing or description. Thank god Amazon has an awesome return policy."
3,Decent product,This product is accurate for non-muscular individuals. If you have a lot of muscle weight I would use calipers.
1,Why did I buy this?,"I'm not sure how much body fat people expect to shed but I think you would need to change by a lot to benefit from this fat loss monitor. If I take two measurements in a row they will often differ by a few tenths of a percent. That is when I measure one right after the first! Measuring at different times of the day when who knows what other factors are different gives even wilder variation. Honestly I would be impressed with myself if I could drop 1% in a month or two, and yet this monitor will read variations that are many tenths of that 1% over the course of 1 day. Not to mention how annoying it is to have an extra object laying around my apartment. If you really want something to measure body fat at least save yourself some space and buy a scale with a built in body fat monitor. Maybe I can get rid of this thing on craigslist but buying this monitor left me only with regret"
2,OMRON Fat loss monitor HBF-306C,"Very rough, inconsistent measurements. To achieve something far like of consistency - you must remember to measure yourself in the same body position, wearing the same clothes, holding device by the same angle. For example if you measure with torso naked, staying straight, holding your hands with device on 5:30 O'clock - you'd get 8% in case your elbows touch your belly. BUT if you spread your elbows wide and they don't touch belly - you'd get 24%!!!"
5,Great Tool for Working With Weight Loss Clients,"The Omron fat loss monitor is a great tool for helping clients understand two important things: first, that they NEED to make changes in their eating and exercise habits, and second, once they have begun, that even small changes, if they stick to them, are going to lead them to better health.The fact that it looks cool, doesn't hurt, either."
1,"Inconsistent readings, Made in China quality","Unreliable to the point of being pretty worthless. Even when running the test five or six times in a row, I get such varying results that I have little faith in its accuracy.Useful if you want to know that you're, say, in a certain +/-2% fat % range (e.g., 12-16%). But you can know that simply by stepping on the scale and looking at yourself in the mirror.Not useful if you want to track results of hard work at the gym and dieting over periods of weeks or months."
2,So wrong,I thought this product was great until I tried it on my mother. My mother is 62 barley works out and not very muscular and this thing read 21% body fat. I had to return it.
2,Different every time,"I was so excited to get this...then the excitement went away. The BMI normally reads the same, but the fat % changes every time I use it. Not just day to day, but if I try it 3 times in a row I will get 3 different readings. Not a satisfied customer!"
1,"Scam, This product only uses the information you set",This product is a scam. It only uses the information you put in the setting. I tried and play with it to see if they really cont your fat%.
1,Glorified calculator,"The Omron HBF is a one trick wonder. It's a glorified calculator, and if you know the math, you can do the equation yourself. It would make you believe that you must grip the handles while it checks the BMI of your body, but you could put in any sex/age/height/build/and weight, and it will pop out with the number from the equation, and nothing based on you.If you can't find the equation, or don't want to do it, it's an investment, otherwise, use a regular calculator and save your money."
3,Seems to work ok,"I read some not so shining reviews of this and decided to try it anyway. I figured it was not too expensive and worth a shot. It seems to work. I stress seems as I have no other way of measuring, so I can't tell you how accurate. It works for me."
3,does what i want it to,"easy to use, keep your info up to date and it will track your % fat. varies by about 1% depending on the time of day, etc. covered in the instructions. for me, i want to know if i drop 5% and have an idea of how much is fat. for the price, it is worth it. i don't have time or patience to work any calipers and i'm more interested in keeping focused on a healthy lifestyle and this just makes it easier."
4,Never used one of these before...,"...so I have nothing to benchmark against. Seems to work, and I like that I can store details for so many people PLUS utilize the ""guest"" setting if I don't wish to store someone's details. I wish there was some way it could give me historical data though, in order to view and track progress (or in my case, lack thereof!)"
1,Dangerous and not for kids,"I never made it to make that thing fly: When charging the battery, it started to smoke and almost exploded. I read the manual again, and it says: dont overcharge the battery, charge it for 3-4 minutes until it gets warm but not too hot.So this means in other words: if you or your kid is forgetting to take it away in time, the whole thing might burn, blow up or just as in my case end up in smoke. Since I am a non smoker, I sent it back and will now buy a plane that is safe."
5,Transports you to the slaughter,"Col. Alexander has produced an excellent blow by blow description of the taking of the Bieto Atoll. The horror of discovering that the landing craft were not able to negotiate the reef, the long march through the surf, all the while under fire. Called ""The Japanese Alamo"" you will be amazed at the errie radio intercepts that Col. Alexander has included of the Japanese garrison's communications with the Japanese High Command. he does a fine job of describing the combatants and weapons. He sets the senario up in a clear and easy to understand language. Tarawa is a small island , there was no way off for either side other than to annihilate the other. I was not aware of some things Col. Alexander brings to light in this book, for example the Japanese use of British cannons and Korean laborors/slaves. You cannot put this one down once you start it."
3,"Ummm, what the heck happened?????","I just got done standing up, applauding a DVD concert for the first time in my life, and sending out emails to friends telling them I just saw the most awesome DVD concert ever! And then had to retract it all when the damn encore came on.When you deliver a show as blistering hot as this one, and have Robbie Krieger (The Doors) and Joe Satriani onstage with you, KILLING it, and you give the spotlight over to ... ummm... sorry, but JUST SOME RAPPER... well, you're gonna take a hit.Is he a good rapper? Sure, I s'pose. For flavoring on a song, perhaps. But to give away the moment to rap? Nopers. Not gonna fly.If Particle ever gets a guitarist to stay, and drops this rap crossover crappola, they might just be the most important band we've seen in a while.I've never been so excited, then disppointed. Hard to shake this off now. What to tell my jam loving friends..."
2,A silly fun Halloween movie,"""Night of the Living Dorks"" is aimed at the teenage comedy/horror market. It's a little bit like a low-grade German version of ""Scream"" mixed with ""American Pie"" - plenty of low-brow sexual humor to go around. Despite its good natured humor, the movie doesn't quite achieve even the B-level movie status to which it aspires.NOTE: Unfortunately, the version of the movie available here on Unbox suffers from really poor dubbing. The trailer showed closed-captioning, which I believe would have made the movie much more bearable."
4,Good DVD for kids,"This is a good show for kids, it's very informative and the young presenters do a good job making this show interesting and fun. There are many interesting topics which are explored but I do have one complaint which is that each episode is a bit short. Great if you have kids who are younger but the older ones may find this less informative as the topics covered are not explored in much detail. But on the whole, it's still a fun way to learn about stuff!"
2,"Not totatally worthless, but of very little value","OK, This book looked great at first glance, but as many of the other reviewers have said, it was totally worthless as a reference. The stuff on the web, even though sketchy in some places, was miles ahead. I have had to look throught the source code for really tough questions. I hope that O'Reilly gets a book out. I have been tempted to go back to Motif because it has really good reference manuals."
4,Good intro to GTK+ and GLIB,"I bought this book last week, have read most of it by now, successfully downloaded and installed a version of GTK+ and GLIB in my RedHat5 LINUX, and have entered, successfully compiled, and run many of the GUI examples already. I just read these reviews below and exclaimed, ""Boy! This book is not THAT bad."" If you are a salty veteran of UNIX GUI, don't buy it, but I found it very helpful.Maybe, given the incredible rapid growth of LINUX, in another year a better book will emerge (or perhaps a second edition of this one), but until then I haven't seen a better one. Also, regarding the ""use the source comment"": That is fine if you are already a Jedi Knight, but if not, this book gives you a few working examples to use as a blaster if no light saber is handy ..."
5,Classy look for a great price,"I bought these shades to replace ones that had been on a light fixture over a pool table. We moved the pool table and I didn't want to change out the fixture when we made the room our home office. These shades (three of them) look super on the fixture and make the office look very Craftsman-like, which was my intention. One shade arrived a little bent, but it wasn't worth the hassle of exchanging. Best price and best look I found for my office makeover. Thanks, Overstock.com!"
3,Not pleased,I found that many ingredients in this book are things I don't usually have in the house. The recipes are too involved (too many ingredients for me.)
1,If delicious is what you are looking for get something else,"I have made 3 of the recipes in this book and all 3 have been horrible. I made the sweet peas and pasta, chicken ceasar burgers and the italian tuna cassarole. After making the second recipe, (chicken ceasar burgers) I told my husband I was putting the cookbook away because both the recipes I have made were, well, yuck. Then I ventured into the cookbook one last time. I made the tuna dish. This was the worst! We had to ditch it and make something else. If you like great dishes get Paula Deen or Ina Garten recipe books. From those I haven't had a bad dish!Lastly,I have made the recipes in thirty minutes so that aspect is correct."
3,It's okay..,"I bought this book because I really like her. Unfortunately, you have no idea which recipes are good.. and which are not. The book is also not ideal for placing next to you while you cook. They should change the binding! Another minus.. no pic of what the finished product should look like. I understand it's a budget book.. but there has to be some features to make me want to buy another one.I think I prefer browsing on Food Network... there are reviews from other cooks on whether or not it is good."
3,"A good concept, but too many expensive ingredients","The concept of this book is a good one, but RR uses too many expensive ingredients. I think she forgets that we aren't all millionaires like she is."
3,ok.,"I should have known that being a chef on food network she is going to ask her readers to use food in recipes that non professional chefs would never have heard of. Some of these recipes end up being rather expensive. However, for the most part the few I have tried were good."
4,The Elements of Dynamic Symmetry,"For those who need to understand Industrial Design, its aesthetics, symmetry and creativity operations is one of the classic books. If an industrial designer believes that, before any project, it is necessary to build a structural grid, and a ""philosophical"" geometric principle, The Elements of Dynamic Symmetry, by Jay Hambidge, is one of those books.by Prof. Luiz Vidal Gomes, PhD, Brazilian industrial designer."
5,EXCELLENT JOB,"Also could not put it down and read it very slowly so it would last. It's difficult finding good historical fiction, which is incidentally about the west, but this author continues to be superb. Liked it enough to order it for my father who is a western reader, but he will not be disappointed with the excellent Apache information and descriptions of a most ferocious time. LH"
1,Ouch!,"This stuff stings like crazy. It smells worse than rubber cement. It takes 10-15 minutes for it to dry, and you can't do anything until it's dry. Within a few hours is starts to peel off, and if you try to peel it off completely, it reopens your wound. Awful, awful stuff."
5,Excellent healing promoter,"New Skin is incredible. I've used it on a number of occasions for medium to fairly bloody (although still minor) cuts. In the past, such wounds almost always got infected and then would take many days to heal. Not so with New Skin. New Skin prevented any infection, and by my observation, healing time was cut (no pun) in half. It forms a nice, flexible, waterproof seal that breathes, allowing the wound to heal in a germ-free environment. I couldn't do without a bottle always available and at hand in the house. Who cares about the smell (which I think is nicely antiseptic), I'm not buying perfume here. Highly recommended."
3,I forgot how bad old strategy guides were....,"My roommate and I were replaying the first RE and the online walk-thru's we found weren't totally helpful. I picked this up totally forgetting how much strategy guides have evolved over the years. If you don't mind reading and trying to find your way like that, it's fine. I've gotten used to detailed maps and guides, so that was a little annoying to me. We did get a good laugh out of it, and it did help us a little bit when combined with what we remembered and what we found online."
4,Good alternative to drugs,"A biochemist friend suggested I try 5-HTP for sleep-related problems. Very skeptical at first, I became a believer. After one month of regular use, I seem to be sleeping beter, not foggy or tired in the AM. No side effects that I can tell. Great discovery!"
1,Very disappointing.,"I wanted to love this book. I cut my political teeth volunteering at the Reagan/Bush '84 national headquarters. Like Mrs. Bush, I'm staying at home to raise our kids. I have always felt a connection to Mrs. Bush's public persona, so I was so excited when this book came out!What a letdown. It reads like a list. She treats the amputation of her own toes the same as why George Bush left the NRA which is treated the same as her bland chicken casserole recipe. The book is sprinkled with bland recipes and it's riddled with asterisks by names of famous people I should probably care about but don't.Perhaps Mrs. Bush has earned to right to look back on such a rich life and treat it with the depth and wisdom of a grocery list. Perhaps it's a tribute to all those people with asterisks next to their names. It does not make for good reading."
3,This is an ok book,I found this book to be slow reading. The best parts of the book is when Barbara Bush talks about the over seas trips they take. I usually read a book in a decent amount of time. This book took me at least a month to read. I would pick it up and read a few pages then put it down. If you give up easy on reading a book do not buy this one.
1,Amazon sells as new and ships user/refurb,"This is not about the router, its about Amazon shipping me, not one but two used or refurbished routers when I purchased a new one. A call to customer service revealed (they said) they were having distribution problems and all they could do was offer a refund. That's great except I have now waited three weeks and still do not have what I paid for and what happens with the next item I purchase? Bad experience. Don't buy this router from Amazon, you will likely get what I did."
1,.,"the plastic height adjustment knob broke within minutes after receiving the router, the base felt of router. now I own two peaces of junk. 10 inch miter saw... the only thing hitachi made right"
3,"1/2 "" Collet and bit is stuck",I researched the router b/4 buying. Hitachi got great reviews in general and this router is powerful. I used it several times. Still learning to control it properly however the collet and bit is stuck. I did not find information from the company to be helpful. There are users out there with better videos. The company needs to offer a beginners guide to the use and how to change out the parts as well as solutions as it is I will only be able to use the existing bit in there.
3,Hitachi plunge router,"The product meets specifications, but the instruction manual is pathetic: very poor illustrations, confusing wording. The website is no better."
2,Clearly a refurbished item listed as new,"No idea what the router itself works like, since I am sending it back. Received the package with a router in it that is scratched up on multiple sides and has clearly been used and returned. The really sad thing is that I would have been willing to pay what I did for a refurbished item, but not when it is clearly labeled as a new item. If they are going to label it as new, they need to be sending new items when they are purchased.going to try again because I really want this router and I can't find anywhere to buy it local."
1,Ouch,"Thank God I didn't buy this. Just the samples hurt the ears. DON'T BUY ANYTHING TAHT SAYS ""TRIBUTE TO (name of artist)"" by VARIOUS ARTISTS because they're all HORRIBLE. Is this the lady who also did the ""tribute"" to Aaliyah? Cuz that one one was just as horrible. Poor Janet (and Aaliyah, for hers). The cover is kinda nice though."
1,Worked. Broke after trying to remove cable,Fell apart into three pieces when removing a cable. Super glue. Works again. Now just a bit loose. You get what you pay for.
3,It was an older model,The battery compartment had some rust issues and I had to pry the spring for the battery to work. But all in all it does work and hopefully doesn't let me down on the job.
1,Fluke 322 clamp meter,Received this item today and found out this is made in TAIWAN. Very disappointed. I try to avoid purchasing products made from this country because they have very poor quality. They don't last long. I hope this will work and I'll get my money's worth.
2,Just a Fluke?,"As an electrician and in the trade for 30 years or so I have always relied on Fluke and searched for the very best clamp meter from them to suit my needs.I received it and was very surprised to see that it is made in TAIWAN, no longer an American product, they mislead you by saying it was designed in the USA.I called Fluke and was told ALL clamp meters are no longer made in the USA.I no longer will buy nor trust Fluke because for the money I paid I can buy just about any cheapo meter."
3,"Not Bad, But...","For me, when reading something of this nature, I prefer sex over violence, since that is what I'm getting this for. While there is that, there is also a lot of violence, and not all of it is pretty. This issue, clearly the first in a series, introduces us to an enormously well-endowed (and multi-pierced) woman picking up her shemale friend from prison, and they can't go more than a few pages before big-time trouble comes bursting into their lives. As I said, there is a little too much violence, and a little of it is over the top. As for the two leads, I dislike body piercings beyond the ears, and if you're going to have a shemale, let her put her unique...attribute...to use instead of putting her on the receiving end all the time. I also wished her unique attribute could have been bigger."
1,Brief Charge!,"This battery replacement for the Cannon version only held a brief charge. Maybe 10% of what the Cannon holds. I have tried this cheaper battery with my last camera, but didn't work this time. Oh well!"
3,"Disappointing, Even for the Price","Knowing that the off-market batteries would not be as good as an original Canon product, I thought I'd give Lenmar a try. I bought two so I could compare, and also have an extra backup. Neither lasted very long - a few hours at most, compared to a couple of days of frequent use with the Canon. I've done this with GTMax batteries too, with similar results. Next time I'll bite the bullet and buy a Canon battery."
1,Cheap no good battery,"Bought this battery last March 2008. Used it once or twice only.Now, a year and 3 months after it was (barely) used, its busted.Doesn't charge, doesn't power on cam either. Next time im investingmore money on branded batteries like canon / nikon."
4,Used as a spare battery,Bought this battery as a spare and was not disappointed(even though I took the Canon battery to the limit) This battery fit fine in the Canon charger and the camera. For the price I would highly recommend it as a backup. Even if you never use it for 12 bucks you can't go wrong.
2,Low opinion,I was not very Pleased with this battery it is about one third as good as a canon battery. It will last until u charge your canon battery.Wayne P.
3,Battery does not last long...,Like a lot of the other reviews stated this battery does not last long. Maybe 30 minutes of use (about 80 pics). Should have spent the extra money and bought the Canon brand. But it does work....kinda. I have a sd800is.
2,Did Not Work Well For Me,"Excellent price and the battery did power the camera but only for 1 day. When it powered out, there was no warning, I took a picture and it died next shot. By contrast, the Canon battery just goes on and on with a single charge. As long as you know what you are getting into, I suppose the price is such that you can carry a couple of spares around as back ups as the OE battery is recharging."
1,save your money,"Although the concept seems worthwhile, the product itself seems to have fallen short. It stretches out of shape very easily, making it virtually useless for support or for keeping your hand warm in colder conditions. It also retains moisture too easily, which really makes it stink after just a few uses. After two games, I gave mine away to a toddler who was watching her mother bowl on an adjacent lane. I think she got more out of it from the 5 minutes she spent playing with it as a toy than I did while bowling with it. The ACE company makes several products (allbeit, for joint/muscle pain relief) that would probably do what this product was intended to do, except that they will do it better and probably last longer too."
4,Useful learning game.,"This game is great with a lot of words to learn... One thing I didn't like is the spray paint game, but if you have a DS you can link it to use the DS to play the spray paint. And that's a lot of fun. So, overall great game, if you have the DS, it's even better."
1,The Absolute WORST Book I have EVER Read,"I picked up this book looking for a good Pagan read, since I've been trying to find anything on the subject for months. Anyone who wants an intelligent, fact-based, proven study of Pagan traditions versus Xtian ones, DO NOT GET THIS BOOK! I borrowed this book from a friend and I am exceptionally glad I didn't waste my or my parents' money trying to find it and buy it. This book, if it's possible, depicts Paganism in a more fluffy, Hollywood-like version than Silver RavenWolf herself."
1,"Same spirit, different name","Don't buy this propaganda. Ishtar was a ""pagan goddess"" who, when she touched rabbits would lay eggs. One of the worship practices of this religion was to sacrifice children and paint eggs with their blood. The ""early church"" aka Jews and non-Jews who believed the Messiah had come celebrated the appointed times (Passover, Yom Kippur, etc.) The Catholic Church was birthed out of compromise, changing things to fit in and avoid persecution - such as changing the Sabbath from Saturday to Sunday, since the pagans worshiped the sun on that day. ""If the roots are holy, so are the branches."" These roots are as unholy as they come."
1,AWFUL DO NOT BUY,"This amplifier is terrible. Maybe its just me because my ears are small, but this amplifier is obnoxiously large and doesnt stay in you ear. it had huge writing on both sides, i just shaved it off with a knife easily. The sound quality is not too bad, but that pro is outweighed by the appearance and feel of it. Its made of cheap plastic and the batteries die quickly. Dont buy this. fork over ten extra dollars for something of more quality. This was not worth the money. DO NOT BUY!"
1,"The Downside of ""Yu-Gi-Oh""",This is an AWFUL game. There are NO instructions on what to do and the box is in three languages so it is a challenge to find information. This game should not be purchased. It was one of the biggest rip-offs this Christmas Season.
1,a waste,My 7 year old son bought this 4 months ago. Although is a huge yu-gi-oh fan he found little to like with this toy. Played with it only a couple of times. The cards it uses are totally different from the usual playing cards.
5,A Needed Assistant,In Quaranic studies it is not always possible to know exactly what a word or a phrase in the Qur'an may mean. Some people have other translations of the Qur'an for the purpose. But other translations may not clear up the problem. The Dictionary of the Holy Qur'an makes the work much easier and allows for quick references. It is definitely a part of my desk reference works.
1,Bad Product,The book is a good book if they had all the pages. The pages 353 - 385 is missing. This would bring the price of the book way high to ship back and wait for return of another book. The dictionary itself is good if get from a reputable source.
4,WARN QUALITY,"The product is made with quality. Beware if you have an after market bumper or you have quick disconnects and the parking post mounted on frame near steering box. It took a little modification, but the skid plate worked and the disconnects can be attached to the parking post. Thank you Jay AreA great deal with Amazon, is a great deal and any slight modification is worth it."
5,Outstanding,"The only book on the market, which provide more than the insufficient 3-5 pages with ""tips"" typical for the other books. In fact from the first chapter till the last one as you can see from the Table of Contents the book is 100% focused and dedicated to impact cover letter and resume writing as well as acing the interview.Instead of the common sense ""tips"" from the other books, which I believe even your grandmother can tell you for free, you have A-Z, step-by-step instructions based on the standards set by the Professional Association of Resume Writers. That's why just follow them as I did and you will write a professional-looking, attention-grabbing application. Cruise Ship Job in 14 Days is the only book, which I feel confident to recommend in written form."
1,What? No Zamfir?!,"I was very disappointed to find out that this pan flute compilation of Beatles tunes did not include Zamfir, the greatest panflute player of our generation. An easy 5 stars if it had. The bright spot of the album was the touching cover of I'll Follow the Sun. Quite possibly better than the original Beatles version, especially if it was played by Zamfir."
3,Good Not Great,"While I did enjoy Ms. Kogan's descriptions of her adventures, and she writes very well, it was frustrating to have the camera constantly pointing at the author with only the rare glimpse of the people she was supposedly covering."
3,Sex sells,"This is purportedly a book about photojournalism, but it is really more about the the author's sex life and how wonderful she thinks she is. She mentions at every opportunity that she went to Harvard, mentions every single prize or award she has won, mentions every glance any man makes at her. I wanted to read about photojournalism and when Kogan does talk about cameras, photo agencies, being a woman amid mainly men, etc., I was intrigued and wanted to know more. I didn't want to hear about her sleeping with almost every guy she meets. It's clear that Kogan is sharp and is writing for purely commercial purposes-- writing a book with lots of sex in it will be a much bigger seller than one strictly about photojournalism. For those who want a book on photojournalism, read something else. For those who want to read about a young woman's narcissism, this is a good primer."
4,A little sunday afternoon pleasure,"This book is amazing in content. When reading it you are completely astounded and shocked at what this young woman did with her life. It's a great, quick read that will give you insight to women, current events, and the bigger questions, if you dare to think on them. Writing is so-so, but it's good enough to get you through to the point. End gets a little preachy and self-justified, but overall, worth reading."

1,My update from a previous review,"In a nut shell, I had a bad experience with this card ... period. I purchased two of them and the problem was identical. It wasn't an XP configuration problem (i never got that far). Simply put, I couldn't even power-up my PC when this card was installed in the PCI slot.Anyway, I only needed one 1394 FireWire port, and I was using audio ""built-in"" to the motherboard ... so ... I purchased a Creative Sound Blaster Audigy2 ZS (with an integrated 1394 FireWire port). Now I have awesome sound & the port that I needed all for about 30 bucks more than I would have spent for the FireConnect 4300 alone.In retrospect, I'm glad this card never worked."
5,Doesn't work in FreeBSD 6.2,"System starts to boot and finds the device, and all ports, then says ""fwohci0: unrecoverable error""It's not listed on the HCL, and therefore is not supported."
2,third times a charm......,".....obviously not. If this is part three, i'd hate to hear the first two, because this rockandroll definitly hasn't gotten any better. While listening to this i kept asking myself ""why"". Why should i listen to this when i have Pinkerton somewhere in my cd case. Weezer has made this sound before, and its much much better. PLus weezer had better lyrics and more attitude and witt. Im not saying this album is bad. its not. it just not very good. its extremely mediocre. Its like Andy Kauffman doing Elvis, it may sound similar and be funny, but if i wanted to really enjoy Elvis.... i'd listen to Elvis. Buy Ozma if you like impersonations."
5,Awesome!,"As a Systems Administrator, this is (by far) the best scripting resource I've found.This is a MUST HAVE!Most IT books have a lot of ""filler"". Not this one! Every page is filled with excellent information and valuable pre-written scripts that you can start using immediately.Excellent Value!This book has more bang for the buck than I've seen in years!If you're considering purchasing this book, don't waste any more time. Buy it today while you can still get your hands on a copy! (out of print)"
5,handbook,"Great book for college. The shipping was fast and it was in great shape. I might be selling all my other books, but this one is a keeper. Plus, i'm amazed at the money i saved."
2,Invicta Warranty Disappointing,"After less than a year, the crown on my Invicta men's 9938 Pro Diver watch would not screw in properly. This made the watch subject to water damage. I returned the watch to Invicta for servicing under the warranty. They requested that I pay for both shipping and a repair charge which came to over $40. Worst of all, I was told that the standard time for repairs is 90 days. This is unacceptable."
4,Better than Salt,"I just happened to pick this CD up on a whim and was surprised at how good it is, how good it feels, how good it sounds. Her voice is so clear. The song Stop brings me to tears."
2,Falling Fast Asleep,"... that's exactly what I did when I listened to the CD last night. Sorry, Lizz, but ""Salt"" was a much stronger album. I couldn't put my finger on what kind of sound Lizz was going for this time out, but I guess that's what happens when you use one producer for your entire album. ""Open Your Eyes, You Can Fly"" and ""Salt"" are classic material in my opinion but the only track that I even like remotely on this album is ""A Taste of Honey"". After that track, I lost interest and began dreaming... except I was anything but wide awake."
5,Dreaming Wide Awake,"This music is from the soul of the artist it is breath taking and mind thinking for the listener, yes I mean you will play this CD again, and again. I Love It........"
5,Dreaming Wide Awake-Lizz Wright,"This was a marvelous find. Lizz is wonderful with her soultry voice and her writing talents.She,s the female Barry White of our time.Great album!"
3,Not as good as first album,"Although I still enjoyed this album, its not nearly as polished as her first album. She still sings as well or better than anyone, the lyrics are weak. One song, ""Hit the Ground"" will wring tears out of you until you analyze the weak lyrics. Like Johhny Mercer once criticized: ""I could eat alphabet soup and S--t better lyrics."" Its hard to pin down this album as to catagory. All cuts are down tempo, but is it Blues? Pop? jazz-rock? Not really any of them to be exact. Her singing is great, but I don't think it is as relavent as her other album. Musicians backing Lizz are excellent."
2,Lizz Wright's golden voice wasted,"I really enjoyed Salt much better than Dreaming...because the album (Dreaming...) was very folky and dry. I felt like Lizz Wright's voice was wasted on hollow, soul-lacking production and unmoving songs/lyrics. You could literally feel the emotion throughout Salt. This album feels cookie cutter like. I almost hate it, if it wasn't for ""Stop"", ""I'm Confessin'"" and ""Dreaming Wide Awake"" although, there is a much better version of that song out there somewhere that I downloaded a while ago. It's just Lizz and the piano. Beautiful. Anywho, this album can be summarized as a big disappointment. A waste of a beautiful talent. Better luck next time."
5,Songbird,"Lizz Wright really makes singing look quite effortless and natural, although I'm sure a lot of work went into these tracks! Her style really pays tribute to the artists she coversHer versatile voice reminds me of another singer songwriter whose voice is more in the soprano range: Susan Werner."
1,Didn't know they were dead.,"That's it. Just the fact that tributes are for people deceased. Besides......Metallica started going to kraps once they made a ""way"" over rated album called Black. They completely ruined Kirk Hammett's career."
5,Superb,"'The Ultimate Collection' is a superb double CD set containing many of Petra's best hits.As one of the premier bands in Christian rock history, this is a great CD for anyone to get. You can't go wrong with it. Petra's music is energetic and inspirational. They have great vocals and a terrific overall sound.They have so many great hits on this album that I won't bother to mention any specific ones. There are no bad songs here. I would consider this a must have album for any fan of contemporary Christian music or even rock and roll in general."
5,Ultimate Collection-PETRA,"I have listened to allot of music, however not this band. Where have I been? After watching them live on DTV, and rocking me good. I knew I had to have this, knowing I would go to Amazon to buy it. My Nephew turned me on to Amazon. Peace"
2,Boring,"Just some rambling of a bored person. I agree with most of it, but not really world shaking ""Revelations""."
1,Don't waste my time,This is an example of another 'wanna be' mix of Rush Limbaugh and Howard Stern. I won't waste my time with this trash. After peeking at #6 on Amazon.com the book plumetted to #79. It is now off the top 100 and soon to be out the back door. Good ridance.
5,Glenn beck is a great American,Glenn is a fine American. He stands for all the values of white America. All you negreos and towel heads who gave Glenn one star need to get out of our country. Glenn is a great American and stands up for what he believes in. America was founded by whites and is for whites only. All you demon-crats need to move to russia. God Bless America and no one else.
5,This book rocks!,"I've read this book and it is awesome. If you want a different slant on the world than those given by the liberal media outlets, this is the book for you. If you like the book, check out the syndicated radio show, which airs all over the U.S."
1,What a hack,I guess I should read this book before i review it but he didn't play GTA before rambling and ranting about some things he overheard his interns talking about. Typical scaremonger who wants to blame everything he doesn't understand on why America isn't the way he thinks is should be. Somebody call the Waaaambulance.
1,dont smear ron paul,glen beck is just another talking head for CNN and all the other bought out news organizations that are OWNED by multination globalized corporations. Vote Ron Paul for a smaller government!
1,I thought this book was to simplistic.,"I'm from England so, I'm not Republican or Democrat. However, from my perspective overseas the Real America this author claims to know about isn't the America that is being seen throughout the world. Glenn Beck seems to have an extremely simplistic view on life that makes most Europeans think of Americans as stupid. But, I know better, I know that real Americans are not as dumb as Glenn Beck is. Regardless, if you are a wacko New ager, than you might like this book, otherwise, I wouldn't bother."
1,I threw up reading this book.,"I bought this book because a classmate of mine reccomended it to me. He told me Glenn Beck was funny and entertaining so I was much disappointed when I opened the pages and started reading. This book is a partisan diatribe that borders on racism. It gave me flashbacks of Hitler's Germany and instilled a deep fear in me that something like that could happen in the US. With fake citizens like Glenn Beck, a dangerous kind of ultra nationalism that he spouts can make that nightmare a reality again. ..."
1,Cheap emotionalism,"The book is terrible and I'm going to tell you why.. The pathos, the bathos, the hyper-emotionalism, and above all the tears and pregnant pauses are more than I can endure. Many of us live with a variety of afflictions in our families-cancer, MS, cardiac problems- and we do it without emotionally bleeding all over the people around us. If the real America is a place of sacharine sweetness, sustained by chicken soup and cloying Reader's Digest sentiment, I guess I prefer my tougher, more cynical but more realistic world. But then, you have perceived that there is a big market for schlock and cheap emotionalism and program to that need."
3,Never mind Clubbing the Dogs,"After you buy this book, either to keep dust from accumulating on your table, or to save the life of Bobo the dog, let's storm the castle. For every number that this book rises on the ""Top 10"" list, let's insist that Stu whack Glenn with a baseball bat.The book: edgy, outspoken, mostly right, and as irritating as you can stand."
3,"OK, but too much like squash baby food","This soup is OK, but it isn't stellar. My main problem with it was that it reminded me a bit too much of the squash baby food in flavor and texture -- after 3 kids, I've had enough of anything that remotely resembles baby food. One bite of this soup, and I just couldn't look at it anymore. Perhaps if Campbell's made the seasonings a bit stronger and left some whole chunks of squash (as opposed to completely pureed) it would help."
2,R's DJ ruins the recording,"Rakim's DJ in this live recording can't stop himself shouting ""Yeah, Yeah"", etc. All these live tracks sound as if they are from the same set, certainly a recent time period since Rakim is singing them in a retrospective style with the crowd getting the part of singing some of the best, most memorable hook-lines that break Rakims flow. There are some new studio recorded songs that sound good."
2,Poor Longevity of Movement,"I bought this watch in June 2007. The one I got had the Sellita SW200 movement which was supposed to be as good as the ETA; wrong! Now, after just 2 1/2 years the movement has failed even with the gentlest treatment. What happened is that its self-winding mechanism has began to slip and fail to keep the mainspring wound overnight. This is poor! Automatic movements should last for many, many years!"
5,Interstellar love and loss on a warm day in a park full of people and dogs,"I can't decide whether I like the Space, Western, Sweden, or Zombie song more. In fact, I loved each song more than the next. The album was a step progression of new favorites. ""Singer"" by The Besties is great sexy, summer-y pop. If you need to smile in a slightly melancholy yet happy manner, listen to The Besties. Interstellar love, loss, and zombies are the province of their finely crafted pop songs. Something for even the most jaded music connaisseur.Track listing:1. Prison Song2. Space Song3. Western Song4. Sweden Song5. Siren Song6. Pirate Song7. Zombie Song8. Theme SongYou are only hurting yourself by not checking out these Brooklyn crooners."
5,Sencillamente el mejor filtro,"Excelente producto, mantiene limpio el motor por más tiempo. Al usarlo con aceite sintético puedo alargar el cambio hasta los 10 mil kilómetros algo que no podía hacer con el filtro original.Caracas, Venezuela"
4,Keeps you going,Enjoyed this one just as much as previews writings by McMillan. She addresses real black issues. This is why I enjoy her so much
3,Can't Please Everyone,"Roz! Girlfriend! I feel you. Although, however, this novel was somewhat too wordy and over-written. It also had too many different themes flying in very many directions. However, I did like the idea how you were trying to capture the reader's attention on societal issues. Perhaps that is the direction this book should have taken versus your main character's dilemma. The title is outstanding. I've gotten some positive feedback from my readers in my book, ""Waiting to Exit Hell,"" because they were able to follow the writing style. I write as though I'm talking to you over the telephone or in person. However, I know that there are going to be some ""haters"" as well because that's Satan's job. We both were trying to deliver a message of ""forgiveness."" Keep writing and delivering these thought provoking and positive messages. Our folks need to know! Love Ya."
2,WHAT???????,I was disappointed in this book. It started off very slow and did not pick up until almost the end! There were too many issues that were crammed into this novel.
2,What Happened?......,"I'm a fan of Ms. McMillans work but was truly disappoint with ""Flip Side""... I was still on a readers high after reading ""Blue Collar Blues"" (5 star book). I guess my expectations where too high. After reading ""Knowing, One Better, and Blue Collar Blues"" I suspected the ""Flip Side of Sin"" would be just as good. I was truly disappointed. To many issues. I was hoping it would get better but it never did."
2,disappointed reader,"I was very disappointed with this book. I think it had such good potential and started out promising. During my reading, I was constantly putting the book down wondering if I had missed something in an earlier part of the book. The story became choppy and hard to follow. After a while, I did not want to follow it any more. I finished the book hoping it would get better, but I was disappointed. The author's attempt at numerous themes and stories made it too confusing and the twists did not seem to make sense. It was not a smooth or enjoyable reading experience. I have enjoyed all of the author's books with the exception of The Flip Side Of Sin."
4,They'll be singing,"This CD features Christmas songs that made it onto Billboard's Country chart. There are some good songs here that you don't find on CD too often. The original version of ""Blue Christmas"" by Ernest Tubb is almost worth the price of the CD by itself. There are some other great songs by the likes of Tex Ritter, Eddy Arnold and Buck Owens. Then again, ""Jingle Bell Rock"", great as it is, has been on about a million CDs already and isn't really a country song. It's also shocking that the King of Country Christmas Music, Gene Autry, is not represented here at all. It's still a good CD at a low price and it's worth purchasing."
2,Not as good as the rest,I have recently revisited the sweep (or wicca series in the UK) and while I love books 1-14. I really dislike this one.1. Moira is Morgan with exactly the same issues only compressed into the space of about 2 days.2. Why is Morgan running Belwicket? I thought they all died.. oh wait I see a plot flange. It makes no sense but she's back doing the job her mammy abandoned. Good grief.3. And everything with Hunter... It felt so forced and false.In brief love the others.. despise this one.
3,wasn't what i expected,i've been reading all the sweep series like crazy and would crave more after each and every book but when i got to the beginning of this book i almost quit reading it... i felt like i missed a book or something before this one. i was disappointed how it jumped from morgan being a teen to an adult and didn't feel like the story was complete somehow. i literally skipped from the prolouge page 152 just to read the ending. i admitt the ending was okay but still didn't think there was enough. kinda ruined the series in a way for me.
1,What an incredible disappointment,"Sorry to sound so pessimistic, but I think this series has gone on far too long. Cate has clearly run out of storylines and she really repeated herself in this book. What happened with Hunter and Morgan was very predictable and unnecessary. Moira was just like Morgan and everything that happened to her was so repeatitive of what happened to Morgan. Morgan was adopted and was close to her foster parents, Moira was close to Colm who she thought was her real Dad. The dark wave scene was just like the one in Eclipse with Alisa (except I much preferred Alisa to Moira) and the fight scene with Iona went on far too long and was annoyingly repeatative. On the whole, I was quite disappointed with this book. I thought it could've been done much much better."
5,DO NOT READ THIS BOOK!!!,This book was utter crap. I warn you now. Do not read it! It will completly ruin the series for you. I read the entire book twice. I can never read Sweep again. It's to horrible.
3,Doesn't give you the whole picture,"Ruggero's book is an entertaining read and probably manages to catch some of the essence of a service academy. BUT. And it is a BIG but. He doesn't show you the whole picture.It seems that cadets are mostly on O-courses, leading other cadets, and generally undertaking physical activities. I suspect that somewhere in those grey buildings at West Point there are class rooms. And they are probably used for teaching cadets!!! But none of that in Ruggero's book. Strange.Therefore, Ruggero does not manage to portray the entire academy experience. Which, by my experience having attended another military college, is spent in huge amounts hunkered over books!"
4,Good book,"This book is about the life of a few cadets in a year at the USMA. The author does a good job in describing the routine and schedules of the cadets, providing good details of specific events. The biggest problem with this book is that it lacks the reality of cadet life. The author, while showing a few tough moments, doesn't represent the actual feelings of the cadets. All the cadets are too happy all the time. They are never shown being normal college students making mistakes, and being frustrated with their surroundings. This book comes off as an official publication for West Point, but is still a good read."
1,NICE!! for a few days & no response to complaint,"Well, it was nice briefly and then FROZE with the stylus end out and no amount of wiggle or adjustment will allow for use of the ballpoint OR the pencil. I wrote to the seller complaining and got NO response and now it is too late to return it. What you get for being patient with a problem...NADA. It WAS nice...there's a pencil, ball point and a plastic stylus for drawing on my iPad...now if only it had a rubber tip on the clicker end it would be perfect. I do manage to keep both it AND a rubber 'finger' pen clipped onto my purple iPad cover but have crocheted an iPad purples cover which has two crocheted chains for attaching them to the holder. Although the whole iPad with leather cover fits in my purse I'd rather have the dedicated carrier with shoulder strap. Over all am DISGUSTED with what turned out to be a very POOR QUALITY item and even worse *ie NONE service."
4,Kudos to Ms. Reid,"I was so intrigued with the review written by the reader from Dallas, that I had to read it! I think that Ms. Reid's character development is terrific. The book flows smoothly and is a girl's delight. Kudos to Ms. Reid for a well written 1st novel."
1,"Hideous, Unlistenable ""Hip-*rap"" of the Worst Kid","I never liked BEP before, and now I REALLY don't like them now. What started off as a mediocre rap outfit has somehow transgressed and morphed with the ""aid"" of ""vocalist"" Fergie to the worst kind of whitewashed pop-crossover sham. Whenever a supposed ""song"" like MY HUMPS comes on the radio, I have to literally GAG before I change the station. The songs steal from better songs, built on tired whack samples, with pedestrian, flat, dull ""raps"" over the top. Like water torture - or worse. Then there's the commercials, the merchandising tie-ins, product placements, etc. This isn't a ""band"" so much as a marketing vehicle to mint $$. A sad state of affairs, and sadly the the state of the current pop ""music."" Boycott at all costs!"
4,decent effort,i like this album. the beats keep it going. definite switch from when they first popped onto the scene.
1,you like this music,"This music is bad. It is grose and the singing is so bad it would brake a window. I mean my ""humps"". This cd is for people ages 21+"
2,Not as good as I hoped for.,"I absolutley loved the last album ""Elephunk"". But, this album was not quite as good. No funky bass lines. A little too slow for my taste."
1,BORING!,"BLack Eyed Peas have made it a habit of doing whatever it takes to make a hit&even there Commerical vibe just sounds like a Bad Ad.I can respect some of the Production,but more often than not this just seems like a re-hash at fitting in with what they have already done&nothing here says a decent track.Sting,James Brown working with the BEP is Scary IMO.a safe paycheck but not because this is a Musical Project that you feel is gonna something special.nothing wrong with Success but being as Predictable as this ain 't cool either."
2,Funk?,this really isnt funk. The only good band ever that had true funk was the Red Hot Chili Peppers. This is really rap at its best which ummm isnt saying much at all.
2,Terrible Hunk of Junk,Don't Phunk With My Heart & Pump It are really good songs. My Humps on the other hand is definitely garbage. I can't believe that kids are listening to this trash. It doesn't give a good example to kids.
1,One song to cause the downfall for a great band...,"That is none other than the stupid, dumb, shallow, crappy and downright ridiculous ""My Humps"". How people can like this song, I'll never know. And no, the song is not in the least bit hilarious. It's offensive. Just the type of song that kids need to hear."
5,This album is awesome!,This is definitely the best album of the year. With tracks featuring Cee-Lo and Jack Johnson...how much better can it get?
1,SELLOUTS...save yourself the money and pain by not buying this album!,"I would give each and every BEP album made after Bridging the Gap 0 stars if there was such an option. Thankfully I have not wasted any money on BEP as I only purchased their debut album, which was worth every penny. BEP brought a fresh face to underground hip-hop when they came on the scene, with the release of Behind the Front. Since that album, each new one has increasingly lacked creativity and thought. They have become the ignorant, corporate-driven, uninspired rappers they originally mocked. If you want to listen to the Black Eyed Peas and not the Wack Eyed Peas, pick up Behind the Front and MAYBE Briding the Gap but leave the rest of it alone as it's all a waste of money on a group that traded in its completely original and positive style for a ridiculous person named Fergie and some pop-driven, unoriginal, garbage lyrics in order to please the consuming masses."
1,not 2 good,"Don't Phunk With Music. This album truly shows how modern hip hop is gushing down the drain. I'm not really a big rap fan, but I do appreciate the work of Ice Cube and Eazy E and NWA, but this is just garbage. What happened to rap artists putting thought and feeling into lyrics instead of slapping together flimsly melodies such as ""My Humps"" or trying to create a pop love song (Don't Lie). This is awful hip hop. Even by rap standards, extremely low. You're best off sticking to rock. Or at least good rap."
3,"Good party music, nothing else.","The last two Black Eyed Peas releases, ""Monkey Business"" and ""Elephunk"" broke BEP into the mainstream, and -not so surprisingly- they have also contained more club-oriented cuts. With Monkey Business, BEP strayed away from their hip hop roots and made an album full of dance beats and party lyrics.However, ""Unison"" feating Sting does have some rousing connotations, and ""They Don't Want Music"" is a pretty interesting track with a good message about today's music industry. The singles ""Pump It"" and ""Don't Phunk With My Love"" are nothing more but club singles, as you would expect.If you're looking for thought provoking, intellectual lyrics you might want to look somewhere else (if you've heard ""My Humps"" then I don't feel I need to expand my argument on that point any further.) For the people who claim this is ""the best album"" they've ever heard, there is much better hip-hop out there. You just have to look for it (outside what's being fed to you on radio.)"
4,Who remebers this?,"Does anyone actulay know what sort of band the black eyed peas are. I have bo problem with there records and i enjoy them it's just i can't decide what sort of band they are.Who remebers when they used to sing songs like this?,People killing people dyingChildren hurtin you hear them cryingCan you practice what you preachWould you turn the other cheek?Father Father Father help usSend some guidance from aboveCause people got me got me questioningWhere is the love?,And now they sing songs like this,Turn up the radioBlast your stereoRight nowThis joint is fizzlin'It's sizzlin'Right.I've no proiblem with them, and i think that this is a great record with loads of rythm and funny music videos.I just can't decide what sort a band they are. Good anyway,Rating:4 stars"
4,crazy.,this group is weird in there own way. there lyrics are notgood. but the music is good tho. fergie is my favorite shescool.
5,Best PHUNK of the Year!!!!!!!!!,"Amazing!!!!!!!!My second best album behind Vanessa Williams ""Everlasting Love"".The entire album is on my new ipod nano....I'm so loving it!!!My favorite tracks are1. Don't phunk with my heart!2. Dont Lie!3. Gone Going!4. Dum Diddly!5. My Style!6. BebotAND ALL THE OTHER TRACKS!!!!!!!Gosh I love this Album and I recommend it to anybody willing to dance from sun up to sun down!!!!!"
3,Great to not so great,"The good songs on this album are pretty good like dont phunk with my heart, dont lie etc but some corny songs like bebot shouldnt even be counted as a song so if u like only 1 song on this album its not worth it."
1,Few groups...,"has the raw talent to write such infantile & annoying songs as Black Eyed Piece's (of ****). They even wrote for Earth, Wind & Fire. Wee!Well, if you're an infant & enjoy infantile music. This is a must!"
1,Let me order the crap special with a side order of sh*t......,"As you can tell in this title I am not a fan of the Black Eyed P*ssies. This is one hip hop group that doesnt need to be in the mainstream of song making. What kind of names are Taboo and Fergie anyway? And the chick is white! Not that good of dancer, plus this is one of the worst songs I have ever heard, Don't phunk with my heart, I'd rather tear it out and beat it into the ground than listen to that song anymore....Die Black Eyed Peas, long live Rock and Roll!!Go ahead, click the unhelpful botton, you don't have the guts to!HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA"
2,unhappy product,"After quite a few phone calls, I was finally told that there are many problems with the ""Fax Receiving Function"" for this product... Yet there were no mentioning of this situation on HP's website. HP rated it 4 or more stars. Now their staff finally told me the truth!!! I wish I had known it earlier."
5,Great!,"I bought this for my girlfriend and she was happy. She uses it for school. Works like it should, decent price."
5,Cruzer Mini 256 MB Flash Drive,"It's little. It holds a bunch of data. It's so easy to use even my copilot can understand it. It's the perfect way to transport lots of data in a really small package. Throw those floppy disks away forever! If North Korea could make missiles the way SanDisk makes flash drives, we'd all be in deep kimchee."
2,"Nice Concept, Poor Execution","As much as I like the slim design of the drive(it is the only model I know that will fit on the front ports of my computer at work) and the way it looks, I won't get another of their products. I read some bad reviews before I got it, but not many enough. After a month and a half I deleted a bunch of files, but they became zero-length files and wouldn't go away. 3 of my programs all corrupted(I'm in a C class.) In frustration, I gave it another try and reformatted and put back on everything that was on there. It worked for a couple more weeks and then Windows said""This drive is not formatted. Would you like to format now?"" That was when my expensive drive became an electronics experiment for me. I don't want a replacement from SanDisk, I'm just gonna get a different one, the wasted money isn't worth the lost data. Luckily, I regularly back my data up!(A hint to all)"
3,Not SO Compatible with non XP PC's,"Seems like the min Cruzer was not so friendly with the Win 2000 since it worked only once with my PC with 2000 on it! In a second attempt to use this Cruzer, I got an error stating that 'Data is Invalid'. Else wise this device looks Cute... and works well with XP machines."
4,Pretty Good for the Money,"This little guy appears to work well. I have no problems with it, although after I bought it, I found a number of similar 256MB and even one 512 MB jump drive on sale elsewhere for less money, and no shipping charges."
2,Poor quality,"When I first bought this, I made the mistake of not trying it out right away. When I did so about a year later, I found out how shoddy the work was.If you look in the section that is entered into the USB drive, there is a hole section, and there is the little shelf-like object. The shelf-like object was created a little too big so I could not plug the drive into my laptop's USB port(or my sister's laptop's USB port) without fearing to damage them. After spending another year or so hiding it away in disgust, I took it out, forced it in by constant wiggling, and was able to use it. I am extremely reluctant to use it in fear of damaging the USB ports; however, the fact that once in, it works fine is the reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1.In short, I do not recommend this product for its poor manufacturing quality. I cannot say the same for how well it works because I fear to use it on a regular basis."
2,Won't work with Mac Keyboard port,"I've been using a 128MB flash drive for about a year and found the space limiting so I decided to buy the SanDisk 256 MB Cruzer Mini. I just opened it and placed it in my Mac's keyboard USB port only to get a ""low power warning"" saying it wouldn't work. This makes it useless to me unless I go out and buy a powered USB Hub. All the convienence of this device is lost if I have to crawl around behind my tower, unplug a cable, and then plug in the flash drive everytime I want to use it. And of course since I use it primarily to move data from home to work I guess I'd need to buy a powered hub there as well. I guess I should return it but I had to mutilate the packaging in order to get to it. I probably would have been better off buying a second 128MB flash drive and just carry two around."
1,Mini cruzer problem,I had the same problem with Mini cruzer being stuck in my PC. I think that the slots on the usb connector are too deep due to the thicker metal used. It realy took me lot of force to get it out. Besides that everything else workrd fine.
2,Let down by an old friend....,"I have loved this tea since my college days - 20+ years ago. Now it just isn't the same. I have been drinking another brand and find it much better - fuller flavor. On the label I notice that Twining's uses bergamont flavoring. My other brand uses bergamont oil which is the classic source of the distinctive flavor. I am leary of ""flavoring"" as it is often used when a company is to cheap to use the real ingredient. I wrote Twinings asking if they use bergamont oil. There answer was ""no"". I guess that it why it is inferior to the other brand I am drinking. Note - I am not comparing a specialty shop blend but another large tea brand at the same price point."
5,No other Earl Greys need to exist! BEST Earl Grey,"I've tried several other Earl Greys and wasted my time and money. This is THE BEST Earl Grey there is. It is so flavorful, mellow, smooth, and full-bodied. It's never bitter, astringent, or any of those things that bad teas can be."
5,Yum!,"I first tasted this tea way back in the late 70's, when I worked at a specialty restaurant. Now I use it in my secret recipe iced tea, it adds a flavor that no one can identify, but one that they can't seem to get enough of! It's also good hot, with cream and sugar. The taste is like lemon and nutmeg. I've tried other brands, but Twinings is the richest in flavor."
5,Adorable Rocker,"This item is even more adorable in person. Very well constructed, easy directions for assembly and sturdy. If this 77 year old great-grandmother can build it that shows the clearness of the instructions. It was a well received gift for a 2 year olds birthday and still very much in use."
4,Pell Mell at their peak,"A fiery, arty instrumental trio that actually grooved. Bill Owen's slinky guitar lines bouncing off of Bob Beerman's innovative drum beats. I used to see them in Portland around the time this was recorded. I always thought they lost something after they moved to San Francisco and changed members. This is their best recording. I'm glad it's available again."
3,"Some Good Ones, But Not So Much the Top Hits","Here is how the tunes faired in Billboard's Top Pop Singles chart for the whole year 1979:My Sharona - The Knack - #1I Will Survive - Gloria Gaynor - #6Escape (Pina Colada Song) - Rupert Holmes - Did not chart for 1979 overall, but was No. 11 for 1980 and did peak at #1 some time after it appeared on the charts 1979-80.Ring My Bell - Anita Ward - #9Sad Eyes - Robert John - #10Heart of Glass - Blonde - #18YMCA - Village People - #8Fire - Pointer Sisters - #15The Devil Went Down to Georgia - Charlie Daniels Band - #50Just When I Needed You Most - Randy Vanwarmer - #29I think some other tunes might have been better choices like ""Bad Girls"" by Donna Summer (#2), etc."
3,Doesn't hold my son's - or anybody else's - interest for long,"My youngest son is a huge Larry Boy fan. This DVD came out just in time for his birthday. It's not as fun and original as other VT fare. It doesn't seem to be put together as well, the characters don't really seem to be stretching, there are no catchy songs, it's just boring. It's not as much of a disaster as Larry Boy and the Rumor Weed, but if you'd like to see a good Larry Boy DVD, get Larry Boy and the Fib From Outer Space. This one is definitely not one of Big Idea's best ideas."
1,Not of Practical Use,"This book was a disappointment to me. It is done like an auction catalog, has over two hundred listings of items which are in various museums, with a brief description. However I only count twenty illustrations, and as the entire format is in black and white, these are of limited interest. Other than this, there is ONE page of ""history"". I am not sure for what audience a book like this is intended, I can think of no practical use for it. It was 20.00 wasted."
5,Knew we could count on you!,"It was just exactly what we needed. We have used this book for years, but now the office supply stores aren't carrying it. Thanks for making my life easier!"
5,Good Book for beginners who don't have UNIX.,"If you don't have UNIX, buy this book. It was made to run under dos or windows 3.1, but it runs under windows 95 good enough to learn the basics of UNIX.(Which would be all you would ever use unless you are a UNIX administrator.) I was a software tester and this is all I needed."
3,A good book with interesting features but now rather dated.,"In contrast to many Unix reference books, this one demonstrates usage of the language to accomplish common tasks. It comes with a set of Unix utilities which run under DOS or Windows (3.x) with which to practice. However, they don't run well under Windows 95 with its file system. Some of the material suffers from lack of good examples, such as how to use SED to edit files."
5,Can't get enough NCIS!,"My favorite series ... great plots, but it's the character interaction that really makes the show. I've been watching NCIS since season 1 and will continue watching it!"
3,Something has slipped.,I've noticed that something is different than the preceeding seasons. I don't know whether the director(s) have changed or the writers no longer have the spark but something is different this year and it results in a less compelling storyline and acting. Something is just out of sync with season 10.
3,It was okay,I only purchased this episode because Steve Valentine was in it. Not the best CIS show but it was okay.
5,Love it,My fav show ever great quality and sound and loved that the new episodes r available the next day loooovvveeeee iiiitttttt!!!!!!!!!!!
5,Awesome!,I love NCIS and I feel like it just keeps getting better and better! I hope they keep it up for another ten seasons!
5,Love NCIS,We missed one episode and was thrilled to find out I could download it for $1.99. Thank you Amazon for providing this service.
5,NCIS never disappoints,"One would think after 10 seasons that the show would get ""old"", but as each season plays, I am just as hooked as I was in season one. I think its because of the characters who are both familiar and yet still developing. The writers have managed to keep the show from getting stale. Good job!If you have never watched NCIS, I'd recommend you start at season one and enjoy each in order... I'd recommend this show for anyone who enjoys crime drama with a pinch of soap opera (without being cheesy)."
2,Didn't get far,"This is my first try at a Tad Williams book, and it will be my last. Couldn't get through the first hundred pages, and after scanning the reviews here I see that it isn't worth struggling on. Unengaging characters, practically no plot action, nothing up front to hook me. Way too much exposition - found myself skimming after the first chapter, then gave up."
1,Deja vu,"Here we have a troubled Northern family with a noble patriarch (held hostage), guarding an unsuspecting world against a eldritch menace on the other side of a mysterious wall. Hmm. Where have I read this before? Or, rather, where have I read a better-written version of this before?Wait, wait... let me think. It'll come to me..."
5,"Fairys, swords, evil stepmothers, war, all you could want.","A consumate master of fantasy writing begins a new series. There's a very simple way to see if you like this book. Go read the first five chapters at shadowmarch.com.You can expect a tale of fairys and swords, evil stepmothers, kidnapped rulers, invasions, betrayals, monstrous creatures roaming the hills, nightmares, magic, and the mysterious, misty Shadowline that marks the boundary between the lands of men and their inhuman enemies - and which seems to be starting to move. This is the first novel in a trilogy that is almost certain to be a great success."
2,Ruined by a character,"I started Shadowmarch with high hopes. I've always enjoyed Tad William's work in the past and thought this would be another chance to delve into one of his richly detailed words. In that respect I wasn't disappointed, William's has a unique art for creating believable and fantastic worlds and Shadowmarch is no exception.So why 2 stars you may be asking yourself. One word, Briony. I had to put this book down with 70 pages left because I could not bring myself to read another chapter through the snotty princesses' POV. Indecisive, annoying and terribly dull, one character ruined a perfectly decent book."
2,Not the Williams I expected,"Having read Robin Hobb's Farseer trilogies and Martin's Song of Fire and Ice, I expected better of Mr. Williams. I am a huge fan of his and every book I had read until now was a milestone for me in every type of fiction. His fantasy and science fiction were excellent and I thoroughly enjoyed The War of the Flowers. Here, it seems he has lost his way. There is not enough character development and the little there is reads like young adult fantasy. I believed Mr. Williams would once again take the notch further up, if not completely outside the box. And if we are supposed to stick with it and see what happens later, well, I must admit that I no longer have the patience for this when book prices are what they are. I don't want a 600+ page prologue. Thanks but no thanks. Maybe next time."
2,Childishly written - somewhat useful content,"The book is written mostly as a conversation between a new employee at an EDA company and various people. It's very hard to read, because the entire time you're repeating in your head ""Does the author really think people talk this way?"" It's distracting. The content is somewhat useful, if simplistic, so the book doesn't rate a ""1""."
3,"OK for reference, but not for learning","I found this book unsatisfactory to use in learning Illustrator, because it's not organized particularly well and because the examples aren't great. It is however a decent reference once you're more familiar with the program.The cutesy tone of the writing also put me off a lot."
5,My tooth is about to fall out,"Bought this for my 1st grade granddaughter and she really loves it.I'd recommend this reader for youngsters in her 6-7 year age group, as they are at the age where they are likely losing teeth as well. The book makes the process of losing teeth a less worrisome experience."
3,My tooth Is About To Fall Out,"My Tooth Is About To Fall Out was published in 1995, which was Written By Grace Maccarone and Illustrated By Besty Lewin.My Tooth Is About To Fall Out is a book about a little girl that suddenly notices that her tooth is about to fall out! She's always hoping that it wont fall out when she is playing...in the pool...having fun...at school...and when she is eating. But one time she was eating spaghetti and meatballs and she noticed tooth was already gone! So now she can feel the hole in her tooth, and is all happy about her teeth coming out so that she can get money from the tooth fairy. Then she's all happy about growing up and he teeth falling out so she can have a pretty smile and big teeth, and she cant wait to see them look great!"
1,Also experiencing extreme fatigue with the relora.,"Just like another poster here I loved theanine by itself. With this product having relora also in it I feel exhuasted. If there is any suspicion of adrenal insufficiency whatsoever, I would recommend avoiding relora which is known to suppress the adrenals. I wonder what kind of long term damage it might do to adrenals even if they are healthy to begin with."
5,Calming Results for my Stress and Anxiety,"I'm back today to place my second order for these. I originally ordered a few other ""calming"" supplements, but I find myself only using the Theanine Serene with Relora. I've struggled with anxiety for years and as a result I find myself getting stressed out easier than I like. I've tried medication and it wasn't for me. These really take the edge off so that I can handle what the day brings. They aren't a miracle pill, but they work. I hope that they work for you as well!!"
1,Not for me,"Took one dose 2 hours after food one before sleep.Was in bed for 10+ hours but was not really able to sleep... kept turning around.The next day I had like a huge hangover and felt bad for quite some time, then felt much better and all was good till I took a nap then it was back the same...Stopped taking it for a while, then later on I tried half a dose, did not sleep any super fancy that night and the next day was tough but not as bad as the previous time.I've tried a lot of supplements for the fun of it, and apart from Yohimbe, nothing gave me such a bad time as this..."
4,pretty good,"pros lightened my teeth a few shades clearly, 5 minutes twice a day was very convenientcons the taste, awkward application of the gel, and the rinsing was grittymore effective than crest whitestrips"
2,Need more power,I need whitening.. This one hardly has made any difference. It just feels clean and safe.. but not white..My teeth feel yellow and this one is not for yellow teeth
3,picture wrong,The picture and description at time I ordered said green coffee extract. I got green tea extract that's why the 3 stars. I use green tea but was set on the green coffee extract.
3,Flight Or Fight,"Ms. Reeves writes an enticing story about a southern woman who forced a relationship with a rebellious boy only to find the relationship develop into something major after fifteen years, but with only one major problem holding her up. Maggie Rose gained a fear for riding horses after a friend of hers was killed on the back of a horse and dies. When she returns to Jamison, South Carolina an old sweetheart friend asks her a favor that changes their lives forever."
4,Horses and romance,"I enjoy reading this book, Maggie and Chris has a lot of things throw their way, I enjoy the way things was handle with each problem that came about. The only part that did care for was the short way the subject of Covey finding his father and the way it was handle could have been save for another book or a full chapter since it was something that kept coming up as you read their stoeie"
1,wrong item sent,"false advertisement from vendor SuperBiz - they sent a replacement item other than Plastic Processing Caps by Betty Dain as described & shown on their site. however, vendor did reimburse me for their error."
3,Shipment is rolled making caps all sizes!,"The caps are fine, however the way they are rolled as a group, the inside caps are small and the ones on the outer of the roll is very stretched out big. I use them with a dermatologist all night oil prescription and have such a difficult time even finding shower caps, and my need to find them outweighs anything to complain about."
2,Ok for foundation,"I found this hard to read and search on for specific information, some critical information was just not covered in anywhere near enough detail. Active Directory Connector for example.I have ordered another Exchange 2k book to try and fill in the missing pieces. 'Mastering' in the title is perhaps optimistic."
2,Book written by a Microsoft cheerleader,"A lot of space is used describing how cool a feature is, or how easy Exchange 2000 is to use. Looking in the book's Acknowledgments, the author gives his ""deepest thanks to the marketing folks at Microsoft and Microsoft's public relations support firm"".That's how the book comes across to me, something written by a PR firm.For example, when I wanted to learn about OWA, I was met with this text: ""If everything I've said so far about Exchange 2000 Server's OWA has failed to excite you, I know this will.""I don't need excitement. I need to know how Exchange 2000 works!I agree with a previous reviewer, that the author describes the obvious in a chatty way, without giving any real understanding. Rather like a long-winded friend who never gets to the point."
3,Good Choise for a Best Of,"Good selection of music but to bad it was only 10. I would buy more if it were a Top 20 Hits, even if I had to pay more. Check out Time Life for 1960, country R & B and Pop were all 20 apiece. But for what I got it was good. Purchased this from Amazon where the majority of my collection comes from. Another great thing was the price. Very hard to beat"
1,Deadly Pleasure,"I loved all of Brenda Joyce's previous books. I purchased this based upon how much I enjoyed her other writings. This book was not only not interesting but down right boring. It in no way can this compare the any of her others. In fact, I could not even finish the book. The main character couldn't hold my interest and the story was just okay. I hope this book isn't an indication of her books to come!"
5,Don't miss this one!,"The book is wonderful. The story was fast paced and at times funny. In addition my absolute favorite character in the series is introduced here. It is a must read book, however I urge readers to read this series in order."
5,SUPERB JAPANESE REISSUE!!!!,"Highly recommendable for mini lp fans and collectors, really a great Universal Japan reissue!SONG LIST :1. FEATHERS FROM YOUR TREE2. SUN CYCLE3. JUST A LITTLE BIT4. GYPSY BALL5. COME AND GET IT6. SATISFACTION7. THE HUNTER8. MAGNOLIA CABOOSE BABYFINGER9. BABYLON"
4,Not as Raw,"The first Blue Cheer album Vincebus Eruptum, yes album, was listened to by myself in 1968, it was, lets say, very very fuzztone raw. Cool as it was, this second album is as good, but more tamed. Blue Cheer is the first and foremost rock band of the earlier era and predates all the lame-os of this date as far as speed metal and the like. Try it...you will come back for more."
2,same old same old,This is the second time I've been disappointed in a Soulstance CD. The music is great. No objection with that. But it's the same as their other CDs. I don't mean it sounds the same--it IS the same except for 4 or 5 of the 11 tracks. I would be very hesitant to buy another CD of theirs.
2,be warned this is NOT a new release...but a re-package!,the other reviewer is right on the money...this looks different but it was available as a slightly different titled and pictured DVD...if you don't own it ...its not his best period..around the time of his movie....and its cheap.
2,"Big vocabulary, dry presentation","I'm an early childhood educator, always looking for products and activities to enhance development and communication. This one is not one of my favorites. Once a child is signing, this may be a good choice as it presents a larger vocabulary than most other signing videos. But the presentation is pretty straightforward, with most of the signs shown by an adult. Pretty boring for kids, I think. But maybe a good tool for parents to learn signs to share with their kids. The best of this genre is the ""My Baby Can Talk"" series."
3,Classic Sci-Fi Anime...,"Very classic. The setting is MegoTokyo, in 2032, which is recovering from a earthquake. Within the ashes fight two sides - GENOM corporation and its androids, Boomers, against the Knight Sabers, a small band of high-tech warriors (who fight for a price). Battles, rock-n-roll and diet issues.Tons of music videos, text interviews, programs notes, art calleries and promos.You can follow the changes in artwork, the evolution of characters and production methods from episode one to episode eight. Many of the staff who worked on it, like Sonoda Kenichi, Hayashi Hiroki and Gooda Hiroaki went on to become big names after this series. Their art skills and ideas about anime developed during these episodes."
5,I rember this one,"Gee was this a great anime, i agree with the guy who said ""if you like Cyberpunk and are intelligent, then this series is for you."" I agree with that totally. only Akira was better, and thats saying something."
5,This book is a must have for all hypnotherapist,"This book is recommended reading for all of my students and it will soon become one of the required text books for the Academy of Hypnotherapy. It is jampacked with so much useful information. I recommend Hypnotize This to any student of Hypnotherapy or to anyone who has an interst in hypnosis.Robin E. Jones, CCHt., CI, www.academyofhypnotherapy.com"
4,1080 Straight Grind Rail (flat),"This grind rail isn't too bad. It's easy to assemble and disassemble which makes it highly portable. Its probably not the most sturdy rail on the market, but its sturdy enough. It can be raised or lowered to 3 different heights which is pretty cool. I think the legs may have holes in them if you want to secure it down to something. I compared the reviews of this rail to many others before purchasing, and this seemed like the best option to me."
2,Can't be learned from a book!!!,"All of Mantak Chia's books give the impression that these practices can be learned from his books. However, most of the people buying and trying to learn from his books have no hand and eye coordination what so ever. THESE practices are too advanced for the uncoordinated hippie."
4,Great Romance!,"This book had just the right touch! I've read most of the Royally Wed series, and this was my 2nd favorite! Keep it up Anne Marie Winston!"
5,SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO good! :),This book was really really good. It is probably my favorite out of all of the series. I would reccomend to girls 10-13. Everyone would LOVE this book!!!!! You'll really like it if you like adventure with comic. Totally great!
1,WORST FLIGHT SIM EVER,"I'm a satisifed veteran of many, many good flight sims and this is the worst one I've ever tried."
1,Sony GRX,"I have a VAIO GRX and have had nothing but trouble with it. It has a problem with the memory slots, the hard drive died and now the LCD screen is malfunctioning which will require another trip to the shop. Sony tech support was a joke, so I was searching the net to try to find possible solutions in an attempt to try to avoid another trip to the shop when I found this site. I will never purchase another Sony computer again."
5,Yummy Olives!,If you are paying [little] for this (as I did) it is definately worth your money. The olives and onions are first-class and the CD is very good too.
4,why hasn't anyone noticed,"hasn't anyone noticed that the playlist is different from the list on the album cover?just bizarre.otherwise, i liked only a few of the songs on the cd. that's what you get in a compilation."
3,Child of the 80s,I got this as part of a gift for my friend's 30th birthday. Since most of us in my group were born in 1981 I thought this was a unique and thoughtful gift and everyone agreed.
5,Packaging won't tell you but this has lovely medium sized subtitles at the screen's bottom,"If you want them , just click SUBTITLES on your remote control and they're there . As far as the film itself goes , i'll defer to a 2004 copy of Leonard maltin's movie and video guide . *** out of **** stars . ""New twists on the old werewolf theme make the difference"" and ""Millionaire sportsman Lockhart invites guests to his electronically bugged mansion , knowing one of them is a werewolf"" adding ""Lockhart is overly mannered , while Cushing gains sympathy in his usual guiet but effective way"" . This sort of thing is my bag and i love the cast , so ***** out of ***** stars . Enjoy . I'm just glad i've got my copy . FUN ."
3,Great 70s' camp!,"I ordered this as a gift cause I recall watching this with my brother & we always made fun of it. Esp. the ""werewolf break"" near the end. omg!"
2,Shaft meets James Bond and the werewolf.,"A wealthy hunter (Lockhart) invites various strangers to his estate, in the full knowledge that one of them is a werewolf. Fresh from a career in televison commercials, Paul Annett rehearses an old whodunnit formula with the gimmicky addition of a thirty second ""werewolf break"" to allow the audience a chance to guess which of the assembeled B-list character actors is the closet lycanthrope. Despite obvious attempts at ""racy"" action sequences, and the timely use of Lockhart as the leading man, the result is mostly turgid and lacking in atmosphere."
2,Loved Peter Cushing . . .,"but hated this movie. What a silly premise - a big game hunter getting together people who happened to be in the vicinity of mutilation attacks on humans - and then he tells them that one of them is a werewolf and that he's going to kill it!!!??? Then, one by one each guest is systematically killed. The movie could have ended 1 hour earlier (I think it's 1 hour 30 minutes long), and had the same, tiring outcome. Very monotonous, and tedious. I wouldn't recommend it."
4,Good starter information,"The lecture by Dr. Weil is excellent information on the dynamics and scientific work being done with medical hypnosis. The sessions with Dr. Gurgevich on Disc 2 were a review for me having already been trained as a hypnotherapist. Therefore, this is a CD I would only listen to once and/or refer to if trying to start someone else out with hypnosis. However, I did go to Dr. Gurgevich's website and order 4 of his CD's specific to some medical issues and impending surgery I am dealing with. Therefore, I do belive their information is accurate and effective."
4,Hard working young singer,This is the first CD by a local singer from the Oklahoma area. He and his group have a nice clear county rock style. They should do well. You will enjoy the music.
3,Not too shabby,"Overall it's a pretty decent CD. To be honest, I really only listen to about 40% of it, but that part is absolutely fabulous! Silver Future is one of my favorites, Dirtball is great, but the one song that really saves this soundtrack is Buried Alive. Its an astronomically great song."
5,Where the hell are the reviews?,"I will make it short, this is the best damn soundtrack to have come out in years!"
3,The Red Accordian,This item is not worth the money. The strap broke the first day. The keys do not work all the time. Thank goodness the granddaughter doesn't know the difference.
1,You've got to be kidding,"This is collection of grainy and VERY BIZZARE black and white photos. I've seen better results from a point and shoot. If your expecting one of those beautiful collections of an artisit's work, SURPRISE! The true value of this work is somewhere between disguarded photos and the ones hid under the bed of an andolescent. Thank you Amazon for your liberal return policy."
2,Should've listened...,I should've listened to the other complaints and so should you. Its flimsy. The bracket is weak. It cracks as you attempt to tighten it. It doesn't stay put. It vibrates. Poor design. I think its kind of small too after really paying attention in my friends wake boats. Kind of tough to really see the kids on a tube 60-80ft back there. It didn't last one summer. Keep looking!
2,Macular Degeneration Discussion Inadequate,Remarkably this book has only one chapter on macular degeneration. Other eye diseases are discussed in chapters that follow. Useful descriptions of macular degeneration research or ways to achieve living independence are lacking. Heavy emphasis is placed upon nutrition therapy. I found other books to be of more value in understanding the role of nutrition strategies in preserving sight and practical ways to follow them in daily living. This book alone will not fulfill most needs.
3,Good Book,"This is a good book if you are in to natural heaing. I was actually doing research on Macular Degeneration for my Dad and picked this one up. To be honest though, had I been in a bookstore actually glancing through it, I probably would not have purchased it. Nothing bad about it, but just not worth the money."
3,"low budget, but very good effects and make up","i bought the movie at a real good price at big lots. i did not know anything about the movie, but i am a fool for everything with a zombie in it. i have not finished watching the movie, but it is surprisingly good, low budget, but the effects are good, the gun shots look real, the gore is great ,looks good and plenty of it(the gore)....give it a shot"
3,Thumb spica splint,"The splint arrived very quickly. I have used it several times while playing basketball. I cut the end off to expose the tip of my thumb for at least some ""feel"". It is a good protective item. Don't confuse it with a real splint though. For the price it is an acceptable transition for a joint problem( broken or strained ) at the base of the thumb. Don't expect it to replace a trip to the physician. I would rate it a very good buy for protection after the joint has healed."
2,Depending how bad your thumb is,"My thumb is really bad, overused tendons so this really didn't help because it allowed my thumb to move around too much. I guess if you only need minimal support then this would work."
4,THIS IS ROCK AND ROLL,"GREAT STUFF - EXCELLENT SONGS - PRODUCTION ISN'T A#1, THIS ALBUM WOULD BE FIVE STARS IF PRODUCTION WAS A LITTLE BETTER - NOT A GREAT MIX JOB - BUT - MAN THIS ROCKS. I HAVE SEEN THESE GUYS LIVE, TOP NOTCH SHOWMEN!! THE GUITARIST IS ""ALL THAT AND MORE"".THIS ALBUM IS WHISKEY STRAIGHT UP! THINK GATTON/HORTON HEAT/THOROGOOD.IF THEY PLAYED THIS ON THE RADIO (...)TODAY, THE WHOLE WIDE WORLD WOULD BE HEALED! THIS CD HAS BEEN ON THE TOP OF MY CD PILE FOR WEEKS. I'M A SWAGGERTS JUNKIE!"
5,Early Crossovers,"Many of the songs here were not just high on the country chart (which often amounted to being #57 on the pop or rock and roll charts). ""Walk on By"", ""Big Bad John"", ""Hello Walls"", ""North to Alaska"", ""I Fall to Pieces"", ""Sea of Heartbreak"" and ""San Antonio Rose"" were all played on pop rock stations in most parts of the country. Not surprising as the writers of these songs include Don Gibson (""I Can't Stop Loving You"") and Willie Nelson. This is good non-offensive country music. Recommended."
2,"Actron CP9025 Honda, Nissan and Toyota OBD 1 Engine and ABS Trouble Code Scanner",Excellent price and quick shipping!!
3,psychotherapy,"The book wasn't horrible, but I think it was geared towards those who are more artistic even though the author says everyone can do what she says. For those people who have deeper issues related to their procrastination I don't think this book will be enough. Some form of therapy should go along with it. For those of us who have dealt with procrastination all of our lives and have seemed to have tried ""everything in the book"" to stop I didn't find this book to be very helpful."
5,Wonderful Book! Don't Underestimate This One!!,"I was hesitant to buy this book after reading the other review.I'm glad I didn't, this is a wonderful book, the hangers and hot water bottle cover are wonderful, as are the other patterns in this book.She has not lost her inspirational touch!Happy knitting!Nanette of Fruitland, ID"
5,Best TV remake ever?,"My wife and I randomly stumbled upon The Dresden Files a few months ago and couldn't believe how well-done these episodes are. The first one was quite good, and the rest were even better. The cancellation of the show after only one season was a travesty."
4,Dresden Files Review,"I loved this series, why did they have to go and cancel is after the 1st season. It was only a handfull of episodes and most were just the beginning of what happens in the books written by Jim Butcher. The only thing a would have to say was disapointing was that there was not enough bonus content on the season. Overall it was a great value $22.99(CND) I really hope they do choose to continue the series sometime in the near future."
5,The Best,"This is the best new series that the SciFi channel has had in recent years. Watch it, you'll like it.Debbie"
1,One season too many,"The books are fantastic. They would make an amazing series ... of movies. It would require an investment of time, money and talent equivalent to what was done with Lord of the Rings or Harry Potter. On the other hand, this series was so rushed, poorly written, poorly acted and cheesy that it probably harmed the ability to attract investors to do a good, all out movie.When this came out I wanted - REALLY WANTED - to like it. Week after week I found I just couldn't bring myself to watch it. It impugns, by association, the quality of the books. There are many one-season series I miss, and believe were cancelled for the wrong reasons, but this one wasn't cancelled for the wrong reasons. It really did stink."
4,Sam Spade meets Harry Potter,"I found this series almost by accident on the Space channel, about half way into it. I fell in love with the Wizard Harry Dresden right away. He has that slightly tousled almost ""Colombo""-like dishevelment look down to a tee, and he brings it off beautifully. There is an on-going story that develops concerning the past of this character, and how he ended up in a store=front operation, advertising as a wizard. He works with a local police woman and solves crimes (or problems for clients) related to the supernatural (demons, soul suckers, vampires, that sort of thing).He has a great side kick - ""Bob"" who is a hundreds of years old ghost and he helps Harry with some trickier magical dilemmas.I have since looked into the books (read Storm Front) and the stories are just great. Detailed, involved and intelligent.I'd highly recommend this for fans of Angel (another great canceled TV show)."
5,Dresden Files,"I became interested in this book series by first being introduced to the audio cd's read by James Marsters. They were absolutly wonderful, so when the tv series came out I knew I had to check them out. Even though there are differences, like there always is between books and film, the series is wonderful in it's own right. Paul Blackthorn couldn't be more perfect for the part and it just keeps getting better. I will definatly be buying this and I have my fingers crossed that we will be treated to a season 2."
5,Great!,"By the time I discovered the books and that there had been a TV series, the series was cancelled.I never expect TV shows to capture the essence of a book. This series was a very good attempt. It has the same edgy quality I enjoyed in Forever Knight. At least FK got three years.So glad there is a new book on the horizon."
3,Could have been so much better,"I love the book series by Jim Butcher, so when I heard this was going to be a tv show, I was very excited. I did enjoy it when it originally aired. I anticipated the show each week and was remained at rapt attention throughout each show.I really enjoyed it.Now, this show only lasted one season. Anyone who has read the book series can tell you that the story has a whole lot of potential that I don't think the show acheived. I think that more now that I have watched all the episodes on the DVD. The order that they were released in doesn't seem well planned out.While it is entertaining and I like the actors that are in the main roles, I wanted it to be so much better."
2,Misleading at best,"Let me state that I am a huge fan of the book series the Dresden Files. I think that they are brilliantly written and wonderful. I expected something similar to the books in the show and found it was not there. It would have been nice to know that this TV series was based on the books, and only loosely at best. Paul Blackthorne, although a good actor, does not carry the persona of Harry Dresden, it just doesn't work. Second, I'm sorry but Murphy is described as being a petite blond warrior, not a somewhat tall, petulant, brunette. I was also looking forward to seeing Mouse. The other continuity issues I had were Harry's apartment being completely wrong, the blue bettle being missing, and Bob. If you are a huge fan of the books, please don't buy this item, its really not worth it."
1,Terrible!!!,I own all the Dresden books they are all great. When I heard that there was going to be a tv series I was looking forward to seeing it. After it aired I was disappointed. The series was nothing like the books. There were many differences in characters and setting. If you have read the books don't buy this you will only be disapointed.
1,Bland pap,"The producers took what could have been fun and turned it into bland pap. Why couldn't they have him drive a vw, did they not get money from the vw corporation? Why couldn't he have his staff? Simple little things that took most of what made the books really good and turned them into pap, I guess so that the Christian Rightwingers wouldn't scream SATANISM!!!"
5,Love the books. Great series,"After reading most of the Dresden books. I was delighted to find this series. Of course the storylines are a little more compact than the books for each one hour show, but still entertaining. My husband has not read the books, but still enjoys the shows. Wish there were more seasons."
5,The Dresden Files,"I loved this show when it was on television. I was sorry when it was canceled. The tv show is almost as good as the Dresden books by Jim Butcher, who had a walk-on in one of the programs, 'What About Bob'."
5,Sci Fi should have kept this one on,"Sci Fi gave up too early on this one. It has great ""girl"" appeal. Too bad it's gone."
1,Disk 3 is bad,I've been to the store 3 times now and disk 3 won't play on any of them.And now I find out SF has canceled the show to boot. Never watching that stinking channel again.
3,reader beware,"If you expect this to have anything to the book series ... it doesn't. My son and I both read the books and with in thirty second of the first scene this show was just wrong. I'm sure is you can view it objectively or haven't read the books that makes it much much better. I prefer the books personally, and i don't know why they had to change EVERYTHING. It's kind of like when I started watching True Blood. Even though they got alot more things right there, at least to start with. You have to think of it as a completely separate entity from the books in able to enjoy it. Much like the musical Wicked...aside from basic characterization(and sometimes not even that) the two things have nothing in common."
1,See the show before reading the books,"I've always found that if I read the book first, the movie will disappoint. This is most definitely the case for the Dresden Files series. The books are amazing and I found myself glued to the pages, laughing, and being thrilled by the endings. The show was probably the biggest letdown I have had since I found out about Santa. Taken of itself, the show actually isn't bad at all. It's middle-of-the-road fare -- not bad own its own. However, it just doesn't compare with the books. To be fair, it would really be difficult to do them justice. Any show or movie that did would quickly run up a large fan base... sort of like an adult Harry Potter fan group but with a wicked sense of humor."
5,Where it all began...,"This is where the band started. It's a re-release of the bands first EP, and their next single. Let me start by saying if your new to Something for Kate, get ""Echolalia"" or ""Elsewhere for 8 minutes"" before buying this, it'll get you started alot nicer.Paul's voice in this album is alot more rough, not as refined than in his newer stuff. But is that a bad thing? certainly not, every tone he gives is driven by powerful emotion. His voice can be intrepreted in 2 ways... brilliant or horrible. You'll either love it or hate it. I think you can tell which side of the fence im on.The songs are all wonderfully contstructed, the only poor song here is ""clint"", the rest i love to death. Admitedlly, it took me awhile to get into this album, when i first heard it, i hated it. Now i think it's their second best album (next to Elsewhere for 8 minutes).I definentely reccomend it to all SFK fans."
2,Its ok,"In my opinion, this DVD is ok if you know nothing about hip hop. I come froma hip hop background, and I htought this would be a fun way to work out. Unfortunately, I dont know what kind of dance this woman is doing, but its not true hip hop."
1,Empty Box,"I bought this as a gift for my neice. When she opened it (cellophane wrapper on), there was nothing but markers inside! I now have to find my invoice and try to send it back!! VERY DISSAPOINTED WITH THIS VENDOR!!!!!"
5,Good,"For a small treatment of all Scripture, I find this to be an excellent source for commentary. There's no way it can address everything in one small volume, but the scholarship is very good and the insights enlightening. I recommend it for people who want to understand some of the contentious passages in Scripture."
3,Phineas too wimpy to be convincing...,"Main character is, granted, under a constant drug-induced haze, but regardless his dreamy, wimpy, passive persona/voice suggest he ISNT capable of the physical feats he does in the book, ie:fighting, killing. Poe as a last name is down right stupid, loved the end and the pace during last ten pages which compensate for the otherwise unoriginal, gimmicky first two hundred pages. Although the voice is really good, the plot is just too stupid. The title, also, is pretty dumb. I think "" Wanna Live? Dial 9-1-1 or Else You DIE"" is a better title. Or "" Spike"". Maybe next time bear can get the title right. This would make a great movie, if Oliver Stone directed it. Definitely 9IN doing the music score, for sure..."
3,Judas gives genre readers what they want.,"This first novel by Mr. Baer will certainly be a big hit with many so-called noir fans, primarily because there seems to be no end to the appetite of those who prefer genre reading. While Baer's style is verging on originality, the content is disappointingly rote, however dark and violent it may be. One might liken the overly ironic love blossoming between brooding Jude and her not-unlikely-enough suitor Phineas to that of the heaving bossomed Jezebel and sinewed form of her hero. That is to say, there's not much new here. On the whole Kiss Me Judas is, however, a clever marketing strategy on the part of Baer and his publisher. Genre readers are easy to please and Mr. Baer seems all too willing to serve them."
4,"Dark, Disturbing and Bizarre -- Oh, my!","I'm not a big noir fan, but I picked up this book because I like urban legends and I was interested in what Baer could do with the stealing-the-kidney legend. He does not disappoint. His prose is simple, dark, yet deceptively beautiful, and he is capable of interweaving past and present, real and hallucinations, in a way that keeps readers guessing without confusing them. I kept wondering, though, what kept Poe from total collapse. Next time someone steals a body part, Phineas, stay in the hospital, okay? I was worried about you..."
4,Holy Crap,"I had no idea what to expect when I picked this up. Wow was I surprised. This story is completely original. Phineas is a very strange character. I found myself wondering if this all was a brief hallusination, or if these things were in fact occuring. I would love to see them weave this story into a movie. This book is not for all. I loved to be grossed out, and read things just for pure shock value. Any book where the protagionst awakens with a missing kidney-is a book I love to read. I would reccomend this to anyone who enjoys anything out of the norm."
2,Plenty of better options out there,"These are going cheap these days and the main reason is that many computers now ship with built-in digital sound ports. If you have an older computer you can update the sound card to provide digital output pretty easily. The benefit of these other options is that *all* audio output is then digital, not just mp3's that you play through a USB port. (Note that this device doesn't support audio formats other than mp3). Now that I have built-in digital ouput, this thing just sits in a box."
4,Almost done....,It does not support Winamp only windows media player 7.1 :( If you lose the install cd you are SOL on getting drivers since they are not available from their website. Otherwise it is a functional product that works quite well and is easy to operate.
3,Harmon Kardon Dal-150,"This unit is great, but limited. If you just want to play MP3's on your stereo in your living room via Windows Media Player only. This unit is for you. Like most electronics in the past they tend to get replaced or outdated. An updated driver would have kept this unit with todays market making it very useful as just a USB to digital audio coaxial converter but the driver does not exsist."
1,Misleading information,"Potential bayers should be warned that this is a NON-freestanding tent, contrary to what it says under the product's description.Please check here[..]"
5,Fantastic tent for the money,"I used this tent two weeks ago on a winter camping trip. I was quite impressed with the overall quality for the money. The material feels strong and tear-resistant. The poles are well constructed and lightweight. Set-up is easy, although, because it is a two-pole tent, I had to improvise as I was camping in loose snow and wasn't able to make the stakes stay to give it structure (ended up using my own tree branch stakes). This would not be an issue in any other season. Regardless, it stayed bone dry in several feet of snow and protected me, a friend, and my dog from some harsh winds. Entry and exit is simple and convenient. Zippers felt of good quality and did not snag. On a final note, the tent was able to easily accommodate me (6'5"", 210lbs), my friend (6'0"", 175 lbs), and my 40lb dog with big winter sleeping bags and some gear inside. Would definitely recommend for this price range!"
2,....,I had to return this book and get every penny back. It is not worth a second-read much less a spot on the book shelf. I didn't appreciate the author's style of switching between first and third-person.P.S. Was it my imagination or did every fifty pages mention the man-woman ratio in Atlanta? Give us a break.
2,I'm glad I waited for the paperback,"I give the author credit for coming up with an interesting premise -- the relationship between three 30-something upper middle class Black males and their day-to-day struggles. I even liked how the lead character left a cushy job at a big company to pursue entrepreneurship. But the lapses in the storyline and the numerous grammatical errors are distracting. And even though most of the affluent Black folks I know do NOT carry on the way these characters did in this book, I think I know what he was trying to do. It seems like he was trying to present an image of successful people who remained down-to-earth. Still, this book fell far short of my expectations and all of the hype. The elements of good fiction are a compelling story, multifaceted characters, and prose that flows. This book didn't have any of that."
2,One redeemable quality -- men's friendships and love.,"I read this book as an entry from my book club. I belong to ""Open Gates"", a book club that just celebrated it's 10th year anniversary. We meet at the Cumberland County Public Library in Fayetteville, N.C. ""Men Cry.."" was our selection for the month of March, 1999. I do not wish to be overly critical; I applaud the brother for expressing a point of view that may not often get expressed. However, I did think most of the characters were trivial, with facades of success, without much substance. However, I did read it. Other members of our group had very strong, negative reactions. I suppose it was a natural sequel to ""Never Satisfied"", which I also read. Since I have little time to read, I would rather, however, spend my time reading books that have more substance. I'm sure there is an audience for Mr. Baisden's work, and I wish him every success."
2,A Book About Fashion,"This could have been a really good book. I felt like the characters were not developed enough and too much talk about the flashy expensive clothes and cars. I still have no clue as to what the title has to do with anything. And I really hate to mention all the typos! I'm really not a critic, but this one was not very good at all!!"
1,Awful Book!,"I'm typically pretty patient with slow reads or books that tend to take a while before the story gets good. With this novel, it was like watching paint dry. The premise to the story is completely ridiculous: men who treat women as objects find that the tables can actually be turned on them. The dialogue between the men discussing their latest catches was corny and non-believable, and I found myself skimming through the monologues of each character because the author tried to hard to have the reader ""get to know"" each character, when in actuality, I felt like each annoying detail was getting harder to read. Stupid storyline and no real depth in the characters or story."
4,Good Reading,"I have to tell you that this was one of the best books that I have read. I am glad that Micheal Baisden has taken a step towards the truth of living in the 90's relationship situation. I thought that the characters all displayed some sort of personality trait that we see in someone, even ourselves, in everyday living. I was happy with this book but as some of the other reviewers have stated, I was a little disappointed. I was concerned with the stereotype that went along with the young African American woman..."
4,Insightful,"Well I found the book to be quite interesting and insightful. This book gives a look at the inner circle and the foundation of male friendships it also speaks of how much men really value the opionions of their fathers and friends.. I come from a large family of black men and I have often wonder do men really cry at all sometimes. Brother sometimes try to present this image of being so hard and masculine. Gentlemen we all know that is because men have such huge egos they sometimes chose to ignore or ""pretend"" like the women they indulge in relationships with does not affect them... This book also tells us sisters we have already known for yrs but never really had the affirmation the saying of "" you never miss a good thing until it is gone"" well this books reaffirms that truth.. Finally it made me kinda of sad because I would like to hope that the little headed does not win with every man."
2,Men Cry in the Dark,"The title of the book and the picture caught my attention, but that was the only thing that held my interest. I personally felt as if the characters in the book were unreal. The aurthor's writing style was poor, and undescriptive. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone."
4,Bosom Buddies,I enjoyed watching this show when in was on the air. It was fun to revisit the show with all it's silliness. I found it as sweet and humorous as when I first saw it.
3,"well made, marginal 1960s psychedelic pop rock","out of 23 songs 3 or 4 are very good. another 9 or 10 are pretty good. all 23 are well made. think monkees (as record company creations), more original but not as good. over all not essential."
3,Great MIMO adapter,"Worth every penny. Don't use the software, just get the driver off the CD and you'll be good. I've used it for over a year now and have had no problems with it, fast and lasts under heavy downloads.UPDATE: ZyXEL seems to have discontinued this product to where they don't even recognize this product existing on their driver website. This is really disappointing, but this product is outdated."
5,Great wifi,I found the Xtreme Mimo to be very easy to install and have not noticed any difference in speed from when I was connected by a Cat5 cable to my router
1,Pure bunk,"The problem with most contemporary books about economics (orpolitics or the stock market) is that it becomes obvious a fewyears later that the causes and effects perceived at the timeare not borne out by subsequent events. This book definitelysuffers from this malady. In short, it's an amusing one-sidedsupply sider fantasy. Gee whiz, how come the economy boomed underClinton with all his gigantic tax increases? Basically supplyside economics is just another smokescreen offered by the havesto the have-nots. Supply siders are the same people who believein Amway and chain letters as a means of getting rich."
1,Apparently does not cover refurbished items,I read the 1- Year replacement for small appliances reviews and several people said it would NOT WORK FOR REMANUFACTURED ITEMS. I thought it should be mentioned here as well as no one has done so thus far. It's not mentioned in the descriptions for either of these plans.Amazon should not show these replacement plans on the pages for remanufactured items--that is very confusing! I will not be buying it and would suggest anyone who is thinking of buying it research other comments on the replacement plans--they seem to be a rip off.
5,We love TJ,"Oh, how we wish this toy was still being made! My 6 year old special needs son loves this toy!!"
1,Gross and Misleading,"I ordered this item based on the reviews, expecting an entertaining and amusing read. No one mentioned the really gross initiation scenes where the narrator drinks out of the toilet while half-a-dozen men peed in it and on him, or later hung a sign around his neck and used his mouth as the toilet while they drank and gambled the night away. It was just nasty. I skimmed the rest of the book and found much of it sad rather than erotic or amusing. If you are not into golden showers, don't buy this book. I'm returning it for a refund."
3,"Not for everyone's, er, taste","Deinitely a propduct of its time (pre-AIDs), it's a quick read, but sort of off-putting even for a non-judgemental, non-prudish gay reader who isn't into the scene the narrator is. Lots of sex, with more emphasis on pain and humiliation than sex since it is a first-peson account by a slave who seems to have found the perfect master. The end wound up in an unconvincing white-slave-market plot that really showed some poor writing."
4,Definately blood and guts,"Ok, I thought that this movie was very original with the ""work group"" coming to a hotel and cleaning it up. There is one thing that they didn't realize is that they are the ""food"" for the hotel and the residents that live there. I thought the story was imaginative and did have it's scarey parts. Yes, it is very much a ""slasher, blood and guts"" movie. I highly recommend this movie to anyone that loves slasher flicks with an imaginative story."
3,Comfortable horror movie,"Neat movie for this genre. A little slow in the beginning, but then it takes off and I was actually on the edge of my seat. When most of these movies had started to bore me, this one has a unique enough twist to keep things tense and interesting. I had no idea who Kane was before watching this, but he makes a pretty evil bad guy who you can also feel sorry for without him ever uttering a word. Not bad at all. Superior to High Tension in my opinion."
3,good,"this movie was good but a little on the same course meaning that it only took place in the one and same section in the house they were in, no where else just running in circles like he was'nt in that house but this movie was good not great but good."
5,smells great!,"i always get compliments when i wear this. it's a nice day-time, casual scent that i use for work. i'm not sure i would use this at night, though."
4,Distinctive but a little metallic,"This EDT is very long lasting, and is quite distinctive. Has good sillage also. My only negative comment about 212 is that it has a strong metallic scent -- It reminds me of the best smelling metal shavings you could imagine. The strong metallic notes die down however, and leave a very strong confident tone. So, if you are looking for something fresh and unique, this is certainly worth a try."
2,Broke in 4 months,"This LCD with combined DVD/CD drive was excellent until the DVD drive broke. Now I have only the TV. The 90 warrenty had just expired too. This makes me suspicious of the ""like new"" remanufacturing statement."
3,4th or 5th album in last 2 years with title 'back to mine',"What is up with that? Lets get original. I loved Big Calm, didnt like Fragments of Freedom at all, hopefully this one will be better. Wish we had some song samples to listen to!"
2,Why am I not relaxed?,"When I buy from the ""Back To Mine"" series, I expect ""smooth"" and ""groovy"". This one offers not much of either. The individual songs don't always fit the late night mood, they don't work together as a group, and the transitions between them are jarring and awkward. I can't recommend this CD. Don't be duped just because you like Morcheeba, as I was."
5,A well Received Toy!,"My 4 1/2 month old grandson loved these cute little stackers. He is not yet old enough to stack them, but they are just the right size for his little hands and the rubbery wings go right into his mouth for teething pleasure. I am sure they will grow with him!"
4,Not worth 5 stars but pretty good.,These little bugs are quite cute. They are well made and colourful. The magnets are not strong enough in my set to hold all 6 together when they are picked up. They are just the right size for small hands and they fit quite nicely in the mouth too! They are reasonably quiet too and so will be good for a plane trip during the day. The noise is only that of a small bead rattling inside each bug. The magnets are helping my 10 month old little guy to realise that things can be stacked so I guess they have some educational value although not much. He is quite enjoying them and so I am happy to recommend them.
4,It is a fine product,"I needed a printer that can do fax and make copy in the office, so I picked this one in a rush thinking All-in-One should have all functions. It turned out that I was wrong. This model does not have fax capability. I eventually bought 3055 again for the office and put htis one at home. It is a pretty good printer and copier. The only problem I have is that if you want to manually print double-sides, the roller seems to get dirty easily and the outputs are not so great."
1,No tech solution,Never again. software issues could not be resolved. hours with tech wasted Threw it in the trash. More product from the new standard of american branded products; Junk
4,Moon Filter,"The moon filter is a great help in lunar observing as it cuts down on glare. A polarizing filter might be better, but they are also more expensive. I'm pleased with my purchase."
3,Not a Woods Cord and Not as Pictured,"Product sent is ""Do it"" model #528904, not Woods model #550045 listed & pictured. Electrical specification is same, but ground electrode on ""Do it"" product is nearest the cord, rather than nearest the extreme end of the plug as pictured. This matters if you wish to plug two such cords into a standard duplex receptacle without bending one cord sharply. If the ""Do it"" product is used in the upper receptacle, its cord will block usage of the lower receptacle. To use two 14/3 cords requires one plug of each grounding electrode configuration. The only ones I have been able to locate are like the ""Do it"" configuration, regardless of what the picture may indicate. I possess an older Woods cord with the configuration shown, and I was hoping to find additional ones."
1,Cable arrived with bent connector pin,"When this cable arrived, I opened the package and proceeded to connect it to my xbox 360 as most people would. When the display came up, I noticed the picture was red (missing blue/green hues).I unplugged the cable from the back of the xbox and noticed one of the flat pins came unglued and had bent inward. I was able to bend back the pin and flatten it out with a guitar pick. Eventually I was able to delicately connect it to the 360 and got a decent picture.I've emailed the joytech support address twice, with no response for a warranty replacement.The picture does look great compared with the composite (yellow RCA), but I'm frustrated with the lack of action by the manufacturer.Joytech support is forcing me to give this product 1 star :("
3,Great for the price.,"This is a great product for the price. First....The Positives! The unit has an awsome range with the remote, easy to program options and speaker it loud (for its size) ... The Negatives! This unit came with a very simple install manual which made it difficult to wire correctly. Did not come with the additional shock sensor as shown in pix (the little square box!) You MUST connect the wire to your ignition fuse or alarm will go off while driving down the road. Once its all hooked up, great for the price."
1,awful ! just awful!!,Don't buy this book!! The 'authors' don't even know the subject well themselives. It is very obivious from the start that they read some documents on the web and quickly put this thing together to make some quick bucks. everything seems to be copy and pasted from somewhere else. examples don't work. there is no explanations like a tech book should. you are left to do eveything by yourself. the most laughable thing is that you are going to have hard time to even get the hello world portlet to run since the author only offered one line hint: 'use maven' thats it. if you don't know maven then forget it. it is sad that apress let such a piece of trash get published.
5,Nice and Affordable,"Looks great. Good price. Comfortable. Though it's easy to put together, the instructions are not very clear. The bolts that attach the seat to the legs are not the ones the instruction shows. Once you figure one out, you're good to go. I would recommend this product."
4,Good value for the price,"This set of bar stools is easy to assemble and the stools are attractive for the price. Not the most comfortable bar stools I've ever sat in, but not uncomfortable by any means. Great value for the price."
4,Great bargain! Easy to assemble,We purchased these bar stools for my daughter's apt. They were easy to assemble and could not beat the price for two bar stools. They are working out great!
4,Bar Stools,"They were easy to put together for the most part. Not satisfied that the under screws didn't have pre holes in them to attach screws. Gave up, and didn't screw them in, but stable enough to use. They look very nice!"
2,"Nice music, but sometimes discordant.","I don't know much about Andes music specifically, but I do have a background of many years in classical music and spend a lot of hours listening to world music. This is a pretty nice little CD, if you can get past the occasional sour note, and the mid-to-low production quality. When I have it on, I like to remind myself of the value of older records' nostalgic feel and of music outside the palate of glitzy, mass-produced songs that airbrush away the odd note gone awry."
5,new to trailers,Hey it is helpful and I'm glad I got it as I didn't know how to winterize it.or check the roof. i would recommend it to a friend.
2,Not particularly impressed,"I really like the African Pride Hair and Scalp Spray, but can't seem to find it in a lot of stores anymore, so I decided to try this product. I was not pleased with the scent nor dry nature of the mist."
2,This book wasn't helpful at all.,"I bought this book to prepare for my first show season. I flipped through it and was immediately impressed at the seemingly varied amount of information included. Once I sat down with it and read it cover to cover, I had learned very little beyond what I already knew.This would be a good book for someone who hasn't started riding yet, but then again, why even think about showing before you've even started lessons? Hunter Seat Equitation, by George Morris would be a much better investment that would get you closer to winning in a show ring faster than this book ever would."
4,Best Quality I've Found,"I used this for five years before I had to replace it. I bought the same one because it really is the best quality stretcher I have found. I suggest buying the next higher size than listed by the manufacturer, though."
3,Not what we expected.,"It's a Wonderful Red Green ChristmasMy grandson loves Red Green; but, he was disappointed in this DVD. It wasn't what he expected."
3,Another side of Guy Gavriel Kay,"I have all of Kay's novels and bought this out of curiosity. Not being a serious poetry fan, I just browsed through it for an hour. Many poems seem to come from Kay's life and are based here in the real world. There were five or ten that particularly resonated for me and I enjoyed those. For $12, this book will best appeal to Kay collectors or serious poetry buffs."
5,too freaking cute!!,"I am so happy that I bought my baby girl the octivity time octopus! 1st off its HUGE, super CUTE, plush with many different textures & toy attachments, LOVE her taggies mohawk, big happy smile on its face and my fave is the hella cute squeak it makes when you squeeze her head!!! Its perfect for my little one who is only 10 weeks old, I prop it on her lap and she smiles as she kicks it & is having so much fun touching the different arms!"
4,"Lovely, engaging toy","My now-5 month old loves to chew on the rings, she is just starting to show interest in the toy. I would not give the octopus to a smaller baby than 4 months old, it is rather large. But, it works well for babies that like to use their hands to explore their environment."
3,you get what you pay for,"It's a big bright red foam ball with a slit to put over your nose. It looks silly-which is its point. It is somewhat uncomfortable. However, it's very inexpensive and looked great in the group photo. They are durable as people still have them months later."
3,Ok but not great,Tried to contact seller got no response.. Ordered this product more than a week approx from Halloween and the product came late and never got here in time.The actual nose wasn't too great of quality. Wanted to return item but never heard from seller!Put another buck and buy something better.
2,The Worst Episode,"I have loved this show over six seasons. Just a wonderful ensemble and hilarious writing.But this episode was atrocious. The writing by rote and the actors barely present outside of being stereotypes of themselves.Did they fire all their writers??? There is no excuse for this garbage.It's the final season and if this is any indication they're just totally over it and just waiting for the show to end. Which is a shame. I guess everyone's more interested in their next projects, I suppose."
4,Fantastic singers and songs in versions that exist only here,"The cheap case with no information on the singers does no justice to a CD that has rare, excellent versions of some well known songs, plus other songs I never heard before (and I thought I knew them all!). I am really pleased I bought this CD, and, at this price, you should buy it too!"
4,"Good, but need to double up on plug ins","This was an extremely helpful product for me traveling around the world, but unfortunately you need to double up on the plug ins to work. Works great though, even has multiple plug ins depending on situation."
1,not good,It does not converts european stuff to USA voltage standarts. Also you need to combine plug conveters to use it.
3,ehh...Worth one watch.,"This movie doesn't really live up to the cast or the concept. Right out of the shoot it feels a little over the top. I think this movies wants to be something more than it really is. The acting is sub-par, the writing the same. The way the story is told is OK. I don't want to give too much away about the plot, so I'll leave my opinion of that off this review.All-in-all, it's worth a watch if you've got nothing else to watch, but I don't foresee me popping this movie back in for a second go-around."
4,So far so good!,"I've only been using this product for a couple weeks, but like it so far. At first, my skin did experience a little dryness, but it only lasted for a couple days. I have noticed that my skin feels smoother, and the clarity of my skin has improved. I will continue to use this product, and when I am finished w/ this tube plan to move up to the Affirm 3x, as my skin should be ready for it by that point."
3,Not bad,"""Otherside"" is the third single lifted off of the album Californication. It's a complex song that fuses dark, ominous themes with perfectly matched backing-vocals and superb drum playing (that can feel a little lagging at times). The song plays great, and instantly fills you with dark sensations. It's alright, and could be picked up on the album for more bang to your buck.This single is coupled with ""How Strong"" and ""Road Trippin'"" which has been stripped of its string section. ""How Strong"" is a song that feels dirty and somewhat lacking. It could be much better, and much less irritating, however you are rewarded with a very nice guitar solo from John that fits in beautifully.""Road Trippin'"" is played here, minus the strings. It does make for an interesting listen, but, in the end, it isn't extremely exciting or worth while. I recommend this for collectors only."
4,Enjoyable,"I'll start this review by making it clear: I don't usually listen to 'world music'. The majority of my CD collection consists of metal CD's - a genre which differentiates itself from most other western musical styles in its fondness for the Phrygian mode.A few years ago I decided to browse the internet in search of 'world music' which made use of this phrygian sound. I trawled through the music of the mediterranean, the Middle East, Central Asia, India and North/East Africa. And by far the best music I discovered was by Ali Akbar Moradi.Little did I know at the time that the phrygian mode is known as 'The Kurdish Mode' in Arabic (well that's what Wikipedia tells me anyway). Chances are this music doesn't fit any of the definition of any traditional western musical modes - but it sure does sound good to these ears! If you enjoy music of the near east, or are an open minded metal head like myself you may also enjoy this CD."
3,Nice sampler for a beginning SF reader.,"I'm the first to review this book. Hope this will be helpful to would be buyers.This book is not very interesting for an advanced SF reader. Why?Writers featured in this book are Asimov, Bester, Bradbury, Clarke and Norton. Good and popular writers, but their work is still very easy to come by. Want stories of Asimov? Buy his two-volume collection. Same for Bradbury, who has a very nice one-volume collection, and for Clarke and Bester. The stories in this anthology will tell you that these writers deserve to have a single-author collection on your bookshelves. Why buy stories you already own?For starters then. Buy this book. Some stories in here are classics, others are mere filler. They point out to you their writers' vision. Still, it's your decision. The truth: There are better anthologies out there.Whatever your decision, do check out the first item in this series. It's somewhat better.I appreciate this series. A good Idea. You won't throw your money away."
3,okay...,"All right, I started reading the Replica series in 3rd grade and I loved them. But now I am in 8th grade and they are just not good any more. These books are ment to keep you drawn in untill you buy the whole series, but I am just to old for it. I'd reccomend these books to 3rd through 6th graders. These books are no challenge to read. I have always managed to finish them the day I buy them. Enjoy Replica while you can!"
1,Digitally Remastered??? Perhaps to Braille,"Charles Bronson is always great. Jill Ireland is always beautiful. However, this movie has a dull, uninspired story line. There is little to no redeeming value. No happiness. The visual is dark, and very hard to see, all the way through. If this movie was digitally restored, it must have been a box of ashes before. Watch if you want. You'll need glasses afterwards."
1,Useless,"Unfortunately this book is not for those of us who need ""how to"" guidance. It is full of useless information and opinion, but very little substance. You are better off searching the web for information."
3,Starfish,It would be better if this was able to suction to the side of the tub. Toy was what I expected but my four year old was disappointed that she wasn't able to suction it to anything.
3,"Decent product, but too many glitches","I would really agree with most of the reviews written here, while it is a great sleek looking MP3 player, if I were to buy another one today I wouldn't buy this again. Generally it works fine, I have no problem with the sound quality, and the 20GB version, which I own, is more than big enough to store all my music. There are however several minor problems with it.Firstly it is prone to freezing up every now and then, there is a reset mode by pressing two buttons, but it is annoying and often the battery ends up much lower than it was previously. The battery life itself is also an issue, if your running it constantly it does actually last for many hours, however if you turn it off and back on again repeatedly it loses power quickly. Sometimes it also drops from 4 bars on the battery to 1 or 2 for no apparent reason.Though I have had no major problems with it, there are too many minor glitches to recommend this over other players on the market."
5,I Love it!,"I love this cd for all that it is. It is a great group of musicians and a GRRRREAT singer matched with a cool production. I heard this for the first time in a bar (El Matador in New Orleans) and I flipped out. I loved it that night, bought it the next day and still love it now. I can't wait to hear more from this band and I would give a listen to ANYTHING that Lisa Kekaula sings on or anything that Tim Kerr produced. Period."
1,Not As Pictured,"The product received is NOT as pictured. I chose this one because the facemask is red. But the one received is black. Not what was expected, or desired, since the Niner colors are RED and gold, not BLACK and gold."
3,Musical Classics 50 Movie Pack Collection,"Very enjoyable, but only viewed a few of the movies so far, would have liked to have seen more colorized"
5,Fun,Got it for my mom and she loves it! All is great when you please the mom! A nice addition to her collection
4,Should have bought the laminated ones,"I bought the world/us map package, with the idea to get them laminated for their protection. Only after I have sent them out to be laminated did i find the same maps here already laminated for $3 more than the ones I bought. Love the maps, just wish I'd seen the laminated ones before I spent $35 to get them laminated."
5,Amazing!,"I absolutely love this map, I bought it and stitched it with embroidery thread of the route of my cross country trips. The map itself is beautiful!"
4,The Basics,"Provides the basics, though not much in-depth analysis. However, the compare-and-contrast points of the Franco-American enigma are touched upon nicely, as are the basics of French etiquette and the French school system. A good 'starter' book for those interested in the French culture."
4,beautiful symphonies for crank addicts,"if you are a sport drug user, this album is for you. throw this cd in, and overdose on crank, you will hear your own death rattle reverberate in your speakers. the sweetest overdose suicide music available."
1,"Massive Effort, But Still Falls Flat.","If publishers were serious about their claim that the best style is one that is not noticed, Ken MacLeod would never have been published. MacLeod contorts the English language, in attempts to be witty, or perhaps iconoclastic, which invariably fall flat on their faces. His usage of alliteration is ludicrious. His style remains pretensious throughout, and most of the time unbearably so. In short, Cosmonaut Keep is a Herculean effort, in which MacLeod assures that the audience is always conscious of his effort.MacLeod does do some things very well: his imagination is vivid, and his ability to describe the world that he has created is wonderful. His balance of narrative and dialogue is excellent, but his characters never have anything to say. The storylines that he creates are interesting, but the linkage comes too late to save the drowning plot.If, as the cover proclaims, MacLeod represents a SF revolution unto himself, the genre is dead."
2,I'm losing traction on this one,"I'm feeling defeated by a combination of factors: the story is a bit confusing early on and the kindle edition uses a non-standard font that is way too heavy for my taste. I think I could deal with one of these alone, but the combination may end this one early. Download the sample first to see if this applies to you."
5,too hawt!,"i love these remixes! they are respectful, yet imaginative. especially the take on 'my world is empty without you' by the supremes. this song, as well as others, are songs that i can't figure out how folks danced to them. they're not percussive enough for the 'jerk', not fast enough for the 'pony' and too fast for 'bopping'. but this remix is made for one thing and one thing only--the almost lost 'slow dance'. you could really get lost in someone special to this beautiful new take on a classic! and 'mary jane' and 'signed, sealed, delivered' are made for hard core work on the dance floor, retro style.not to be overlooked!"
2,Sacrilege! Not for die-hard Motown fans,"I seldom ever write reviews about music but this could not go unspoken. The first cut on the CD which is Jackson Five's ""I Want You Back"" is ok, but then it's all down hill from there. As a Motown fan of the originals, I expected a contemporary mix to add some ""bump"" to the old tracks, but this is just crap, plain and simple. I almost the threw the disc out the window of my car where I first played it."
1,Remixers butcher the original beauty of motown classics,"I bought this on the strengh of hearing a remix of Lets Get It On, from Marvin Gaye, which gave the song a new feel and managed to preserve some of the charm of the original. Sadly to report this was not the case with many of the other remixes here, which have suffered from having most or all of the original instrumentation removed and the vocals messed around beyond all recognition. The Jackson 5 remixes suffer worst of all. This is nothing but a hatchet job and should be avoided like the plague by any true Motown fan. If Motown want to bring the music to a new and wider audience they should consider digitally remastering and/or remixing using the original tapes. What has been presented here is nothing more than butchery of the Motown tradition and history."
4,Fun toy,This is a good toy for young girls. She talks in a cute voice. Very durable. Overall a great toy and it's worth the money!
5,Good set of number one hit's.,"1986 was a year, more then usual, of heavy competition for a chart position.Only one song managed to stay in the number one position more then one week.'Mind your own business' by Hank Williams Jr. was number one for two weeks.That distinction made it the biggest song of 1986.All ten tracks here were number one hits.The track listing, including artist.1. 'Mind your business' -- Hank Williams Jr.2. 'Cajun moon' -- Ricky Skaggs.3. 'It'll be me' -- Excile.4. 'Hell and high water' -- T. Graham Brown.5. 'Mornin' ride' -- Lee Greenwood.6. 'Life's highway' -- Steve Wariner.7. 'Just another love' -- Tanya Tucker.8. 'You still move me' -- Dan Seals.9. 'Strong heart' -- T. G. Sheppard.10. 'I got my heart set on you' -- John Conlee.This is a nice mix, and a good listen.All original recordings, from Rhino/Wea in 1993."
2,Still looking,"This product only had a life span of two years for us. When it worked it kept the bath mostly clear of ice and snow even in our MN winters. Our prior heater, from Allied, at least made it five years. We used both of them in a stand built for a farm supply three gallon feeding tub (racoons broke all of our regular bird baths) and both of them worked about equally well, that is when they worked."
3,good product but not satisfied with the seller,"it would be much nicer from the seller if he (she) would send this product as a ""gift"" otherwise I had to pay unecessary high taxes!!!"
5,Wonderful and Easy-to-Read Book,This book is wonderful! Easy to read and easy to understand without sacrificing the technical knowledge it is trying to get across! I'd recommend this for anyone with or without previous restaurant experience!
5,I started a restaurant!,It works. Really. I am more amazed than anybody that an Idiot's Guide would work but this guy knows what he is talking about.. There's plenty of detail here and I've got a restaurant to prove it.
3,Basic Knowledge,"I was expecting a little more detail than what this book delivered. It mostly goes through basic business information that can be found on the internet. I thought the timeline, forms, and employee scheduling sections were useful. However, I guess since it is a ""Complete Idiot's Guide,"" I should not have expected it to be more than basic."
5,Great!,"This is a fun book that gets kids to thinking about houses for things. It draws on their imagination. Younger children like the pictures & playing ""I Spy"" with some of the drawings."
2,A lot of fluff,"Not a lot of substance here. I did not find this book at all useful, a waste of money over all. A lot of talk about nothing specific, writer wonders around willy nilly, and no real how tos. Information such as formatting of action elements, or just how specific you should be when writing action scenes would have been much better served here, but alas, not to be. Books such as Crafty Screenwriting or Screenwriters Bible go much, much further."
1,Thought there would be more...,"I was very disappointed by this book, I thought it would have something very specific for writing in the action genre--hence the title. I would pass on this title specifically because there is more information in a general screenwriting book, and the writer self-references to his other screenwriting book too much for me. Oh well..."
5,It's like watching the show again-for the first time!,"The Andy Griffith Show has been a favorite of my husband for years. I got this set for him for Christmas, and it's worth every penny. The quality and sound are amazing! He loves seeing the never before seen (for him, anyways) endings that were edited for tv. He looks forward to those endings while watching each episode, while enjoying the crisp, clear picture and sound! I only hope that the other seasons are soon to follow on DVD."
5,Wonderful Family Entertainment,"How many shows today can you watch with your entire family where you are not worried about foul language (in our house, even saying ""shut-up"" to someone is considered disrespectful) or sexual innuendos, AND at the same time those shows teach positive moral valaues and behaviors? In my opinion, this product meets all those requirements, in addition to being just plain funny at times! My children have enjoyed them, despote the fact that they are not in color or have the newest graphics! I believe the stories and lessons transcend the decades and speak to us all!"
4,Challenges in Viewing,"The quality of the DVD is better than television. But I am disappointed because there do not appear to be any extras on the DVD. MOREOVER, the box says that it has close captioning. But I cannot figure out how to activate it. ??? If it can be used on the DVD does anyone know how to activate it? Certainly not from the menu at the beginning of play.Because of my disappointments and difficulties I only rate this first season DVD 4 stars. How irritating....."
5,Nothing Better,"Nice to show these to my kids and not worry about language or content, AND they would watch them all day if I let them! And it never fails,......Andy Griffith is the cure all for what ails you. Great to be able to sit down and laugh at pure innocence. Can't wait to buy the next year series."
1,Deserves Zero Stars,"A Customer formerly known as An Electronics Fan posted a conflicting review saying ""Light's light - buy the cheapest optical you can find"". He tried the GE (Jasco) Ultra Prograde Digital Optical Cable AV22684. This cheapest optical I could find cost me wasted time and money. The Monster Digital Interlink LightSpeed 100 Cable solved the problem. It transmitted several times greater intensity light than the limp, weak, cheap GE cable."
5,amazing- ea shows no flaws,"EA did it again in NCAA2003. the greatness of this game can hardly be measured in our time. dynasty mode is sweet and you can recruit the top high school players to make a great team like Miami better or bring a small school like UConn up from the depths. The game doesn't have names due to ncaa rules, but any real football fan would put in the names of the top college players to replicate authenticity (many players' names like Grossman, Suggs, and Leftwich are all said). the coach Lee Corso, the quarterback Kirk Herbstreet, and famous college announcer Brad Nessler speak thousands of lines in this game. all 116 D-1A schools are represented with fight songs, crowd chants, and authentic stadiums (The ASU stadium is EXACTLY like it is in real life). i reccomend this game highly to any football fan, and if you dont have it already what are you waiting for??"
4,its OK.....,"This game is pretty fun although.... theres one down side its the same adzact thing as madden 2002! the players look the same,run the same,tackle the same everythings the same although its awesome to juke and laterall the ball but... graphics 4.5,fun factor 3.5,sound 5.0, its awesome to hear the crunch and the players grunt,control 4.0 If you have the game madden 2002 for pc,ps2 or anything I advise you not to buy this game...but NCAA GameBreaker 2003 is a much better investment"
2,Great Game but Freezing and not loading is a PROBLEM!,"I purchased this game as soon as it came out and loved every minute of it. Great college football game with awesome features I would have rated it a 5 but have had the following problem: I too have experienced a problems with the game freezing. After about 20 games the problem begins once in a while. Then, after several more games, the game just fails to load. It starts loading but stops when the load bar hits the football helmet on the screen. When this happend on the first game, I thought there may be a scratch but couldn't see any. I exchanged it for a new one. The second game worked flawless again for about 20 games then stopped loading in exactly the same spot. I have now exchanged this game too. I will keep you posted on game number 3. If you buy this game, buy it from a store that takes exchanges and SAVE YOUR RECIEPT!!!!!"
3,Decent . With annoying problems.,"This would be a great game except for 4 reasons:1)The defense is always lined up against your play call. Even if it 4th and 90 on your own 1/2 yard line , if you have five wide and run it , only 2 recievers are covered and the defence lines up against the run . Instead of AI it is really just the other team can hear your playcalls.2)If you play for extended amounts of time the game will freeze.3)The announcing is exactly the same every single game (its gets really anoying after about 20 games.4)If the computer is going to make a first down , then they are going to do it . No matter if a guy is covered by 5 guys, he will come down with it somehow. Also if the CPU decides not to make the 1st , even if his guy is wide open he will just drop the ballThere are alot of things i do like about this game , more of them than i dont like . If you are a big time college football fan and dont plan on playing this more than once a day , you may enjoy it."
5,Great Game.,"Not too complicated to learn.Computer makes appropiate adjustments. That makes running an offense fun, yet challenging. You can't run the same play twice.After years of play, the game still hasn't gotten old."
3,Markwort Umpire Indicator,"Its a bit overrated. I like that its steel and will last a bit longer than a plastic indicator, but the negative I am experiencing is the the dials (strikes/balls? gets hung up in between numbers and sometimes slides past the next number too easily.....causing some frustration."
3,most useful for cooking spaghetti with the lid off,"It would be pointless to buy this pot. If you already own it, then it is best for mixing batter without splashing over the rim and cooking pasta. I wouldn't recommend purchasing this product unless you have medical needs. I got this a long time ago in a big box of different sized pots and haven't broken them yet which has saved me from buying expensive ""must-have"" metal pots but this dutch oven is kind of terrible."
4,A worthy addition to the Cugel Saga,"Shea faithfully capture's Vance's style, at least as much as any mortal can. This story was a good addition to the Cugel saga; I keep it on the shelf next to all the rest of my Vance."
4,pretty good movies,"these are pretty cool movies, they are kind of funny with some action mixed in at times. they are worth the price i paid"
4,Lighthearted Fun,"This is a very adorable little book for cat lovers and yoga practicioners. Although I nearly lost a piece of my thumb trying to contort my cat into a pose, we both enjoyed a tremendous workout that left us both spent and satisfied."
1,As much fun as closing a door.....oh wait!,That's all the game is Mario closing doors with horrid cut scenes. The only bad Mario game.
5,Great product for the price,"I used this tester while I was an employee of Autozone. I didn't realize that it was under 50 dollars, and I plan on purchasing one for myself now. This is a great device and can really tell you if you need to replace a sensor or module, or look somewhere else in the system for the problem. Once we got this in at Autozone, we stopped selling a lot of components to people that they didn't need. This is important, since we would not accept returns of electrical components except when they were either never installed or faulty. Highly recommend, to comment on the other review that it only works on ""bad"" modules, generally speaking, electrical components usually go bad completely. If you have an intermittant fault, it's normally wiring or something mechanical."
4,Life in a pair of gym shoes just isn't exciting!,"Hey, little did I know that changing my shoes could change my life. Now that I am a bit over 50, it was time to pay more attention to the shoe thingy. My Mom used to always say that I looked fine until the eye got to the shoes, then I lost my feathers. Well, she doesn't say that anymore! I now get all the attention I need and I have Ms. Reynolds to thank for that.It is true that men have an attitude about shoes. Who Knew?So, the fact is, pointed shoes make my legs look longer in jeans and high heels just make my legs look better period. No sense trying to kid yourself or anyone else - shoes matter. Now I need Ms. Reynolds to tell me what to do with my hair when it rains."
4,"Fun program, nice songs","It is quite a stretch to call this 'pre-school'. My 4 year old quickly became bored with it, and the math sequence is interminable and goes on for what seems like forever.My 2 1/2 year old took to the challenges more readily, learning mouse skills, colors and shapes, and some basic words. This doesn't attempt to teach reading or the alphabet.The whole story about 'Pirats' (sic) - space faring rats - is rather fun, and my kids really enjoyed the songs"
1,Not as good as other products,"Having had a TIVO for over four years I was disappointed in this product. First, it is very loud! It hums and grinds all night and all day. The playback quality is much worse than my old unit. I have yet to find a DVD disc that it will copy shows onto, even the recommended ones do not work. Tivo will not transfer my lifetime membership over to the new machine, they want another $299 for another membership. If I had to do it over again, I would not buy this product."
1,Biased information,"Karen Armstrong, a former nun, does the best unbiased writing about religion that I have seen. The son of a Catholic and Muslim union who almost married a Jew, I have searched for ""the truth"" for a long time. Ms. Armstrong writes about monotheism in a scholarly way and is recognized by many of the religious universities such as Al-Azhar in Cairo. The book being reviewed, which the author absolutely has the right to write, is far too much about his own personal displeasure to be of real scientific use."
1,A waste of money and time,"This book is an insult to the intellectual capacity of people!I don't recommend this book for interested non-muslims. It isuseless and baseless. There are tons of other books thatcritically examines Islam, interested non-muslim readers wouldmost certainly be better served by some other serious andcredible book.For Muslim readers, I would guess that spending money onsomething like this book could amount to a sin for a Muslim.Not because the book attacks Islam, but because it's a totalwaste, and the Qur'an says: ""And do not give away your property(money) which Allah has made for you a (means of) support to(for) the irrational (the foolish) - Qur'an 4:5"". If, however,the book could be found in some public library I would highlyrecommend Muslims to read this book. Reading this book hadhelped me to clearly see the defectiveness and shallowness ofthe hateful Islam bashers."
1,authors' mistakes,"1- the author seems to have had an agenda and view point which he, then proceeded to support by reading books (and quoting them) that are critical of Islam.Daniel Pipes is well known for his anti-islamic viewpoints.Many muslims take issue against what clearly are misinterpretations of Koran by the so-called orthodox muslims and get into trouble with the authorities in Muslim countries.Similarly, Jews are labelled self-hating whenever they take an anti-israeli positions. examples like these are in every religion.if there was a rating lessthan 1 star, i would have liked to picked that."
4,Opinion By an Ex-Muslim,"Yep, I once accepted the deen of Islam. As a Muslim, I had a LOT of exposure to the Islamic faith. Verily, I was exposed to the negative aspects of Islam, as well as the positive aspects. This book by Ibn Warraq does an excellent job of expounding upon the negative aspects.The reason for the four-star rating is this. The organization of this book really stinks, and is SO disjointed!That being said, the content really blew me away! From the artificial nature of the Quran to the character of Muhammad to the position of women and non-Muslims in Muslim lands to the legacy of jihad, Ibn Warraq says it all. I really wish I had taken the time to read this book BEFORE converting to Islam."
4,Scholarly Critique,"This is a scholarly critique of the life of Mohammed and the religion he began of Islam. It took a while to chew through it, but if you want to know anything about Islam this book should go some way in providing some answers."
1,Why I am not a fan of Ibn Warraq,"If you are looking for a book about how bad Muslims are handling certain things, this ""probably"" is for you. But his reasons for not being a Muslim are not convincing whatsoever. Everything quoted from the Quran is either misinterpreted or taken out of context. He also exaggerates on certain topics. And there is too much opinion, not many facts.I can't believe I paid shipping and handling for this. This book doesn't deserve to be handled appropriately. This is not scholarship, just jebrish."
1,Disgusting,I CANT BELIEVE THIS U CAN TRY ALL U WANT YOU WILL NEVA SCRATCH THE QUR'AN U CAN TRY AS MUCH AS U WANT ALLAH PROTECTS THE QURAN AND KEEP TRYING CAUSE UR TORMENT IS BAD ALREADY JUST KEEP ON MAKING IT WORSE
5,smooth and clean,"one of the most beautiful albums ive ever heard, aside from the fawn. one listen and ive been addicted ever since. one of a few CDs i keep in constant rotation"
5,A Review Based Upon Its Own Merit,"Upon listening to the album and reading the lyrics alongside, I have realized that the Sufferer and the Witness is a fantastic album. An opinion not formed upon previous material, Siren Song the Counter Culture being the popular example, I found that Rise Against have created thirteen tracks all of which are great, the majority of them brilliant. The fast pace is one factor, though slower songs the Approaching Curve and Roadside come off to wonderful effect, the passion, the lyrics and the hardcore raw sound are all parts that make this album excellent. The range of topics on show complete the songs, from personal to political, the videos Ready to Fall and Prayer of the Refugee being prime examples and the aforementioned Approaching Curve.Of course, it is important to compare an album off its predecessors, and it might pale in comparison but for any Rise Against newbies, I definitely suggest a listen, whilst the old fans, I hope you like it.x"
5,amazing punk album by Rise Against,"this is another great rise against album that does not dissapoint. i bought this one third, the latest album being first. My second album was Siren Song of the Counter Culture, and i loved it. the siren song album had more of a punk edge to it compared to the latest (Appeal to Reason). This album, though, was the perfect mix of the 2 other albums. there was traces of punk, alternative, and just rock throughout. I loved the mix of fast beats and the sence of melody in the album. a must get for any rise against fan."
5,The Sufferer and The Witness,"This CD deffinitely blew away my expectations, it is fast and catchy, yet remaining very punk. Rise Against has deffinitely made a huge step in the right direction with this CD. The Musicianship is very good, shows they are progressing as a band. They lyrics are also very good being about politics and religion. The diversity of the songs is relevant on the CD as well, the story-song (The Approaching Curve) shows the band can do something totally different yet be true to themselves. Do not judge the CD by the single, many of the songs on this CD can blow the single out of the water, this is a great CD and i deffinitely think you should go and buy it right now, it is done very well. All of the songs are very good on the CD and are full of energy and can keep you going. The CD is a ride and it is a very smooth one, with no bumps along the road. Rise Against is deffinitely a band to lookout for."
5,Great book for C programmers,"This book is full of practical examples in C for interfacing hardware with the printer port. Examples: a speech digitizer, parallel break out box, photometer, data acquisition system, an EPROM emulator, programming an AT89C2051, a waveform generator, and even a Linux data acquisition system with a web-based display!"
3,"Not totally bad, but...","The small, and I do mean small, metal bowls don't really fit into their holding tray that well. My cats easily jostled them and got food/water on the floor. Just not meant for my animals."
5,you gotta get this!!,It is Hot! It is Realy good. You will love it sooooooooo much.(oh yeah a shout out to my friend Veronica H.)You got to get it Veronica.
5,must have cd,"this is a must have cd I'm really feelin' all the songs there all great!With her combo of pain heartache and love she relly knows how to bring it. But the one I love is her latest single ""Energy"" featuring Baby Bash. So make sure to pick up your copy."
4,Couldn't Put It Down,"When I first read this book, I was in the 4th grade. I absolutely loved it. At the time, there weren't many books with female leads that weren't over-effeminate, which is fine; but it can get tiring. I came across this book again years later and I still love it. The suspense builds right from the beginning as Jessie states some of the peculiar behavior among the town's residents. You will not be able to put this book down as Jessie must find help for her neighbors while eluding the grasp of those who want to keep her quiet. The ending was good in that it was realistic, even if it sort of fizzles out instead of wrapping everything up and leaving nothing to the imagination. Highly recommended for younger readers (grades 3-6) in that it gives many opportunities for discussion and 'What if' questions."
1,"""THE VILLAGE"" WAS SO MUCH BETTER !!!!!!!!!","I hated this book. It bored me. I went and saw ""The Village"" after hearing about the plot similarities. ""The Village"" was SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO much better.To Margaret Peterson Haddix .. I highly doubt one of the greatest directors of all time, the master of mystery, and the sultan of suspense, M. Night Shaylaman (or however you spell it) has read your book."
3,Hard to believe.,"We read this book as a novel group (6 fourth and fifth graders). It was hard for us to believe the concept of the founding of Clinton Village. Who would set up a community to experiment with people's lives, intending to kill off at least one generation? We did like the adventures Jessie had after she escaped out of Clifton. The fat environmentalist she met right outside of Clifton became one of our favorite characters. He played a ""bit part"" but he hepled Jessie by scaring her into not drinking water, it saved her form later being poisoned by the fake Mr. Neeley. We would read this book again to pick up some of the detail that we may have missed the first time. We like how all of the pieces fit together at the end of the story like a puzzle. But we found the end of the book disappointing, it felt like a quick stop instead of a well thought out conclusion."
3,Well Wriiten,"I love Margaret's writing style, and I feel like it's always well done. This book was no exception. Light, but also intriguing."
4,Intriguing,"I read this book in a teachers' reading club at the middle school where I teach. We read school library books so as to be able to recommend books to our students. This is a book I have recommended and each student who has read it has been very enthusiastic about it. This, however, is not why I am writing this review. I think this book would make an interesting movie.If the author is reading this, have you ever considered making it into a movie? Thanks for a good read. Keep up the good work."
5,wow,Oh my gosh! i just read ythis book for school.(which i love)I thought doing mystery novels would be boring. We didnt read this book as a class but if we had I'm sure everybody would have loved it! I mean I sure did. I thought this book was almost better than Harry Potter! I read this book in 3 days flat. Nobody could put it down. Not even some of my friends who hated to read. Well this will be one of my favorite books and I hope it will be for many others too!
3,Good for the price,No complaints. this product is pretty much the same jump rope I used in gradeschool gym class and does what I needed it to do.
3,An average product,"I have the habit of jumping rope indoors barefeet. So my toes hurt when the plastic beads hit my toes every once in a while. Other than that, this works well. My height is 5' 8"", and the length of the rope works pretty well for me."
2,Do not buy for excersising!,"It may be good for kids.. But still, It depends what to compare it to.I purchased it for exercising as fun fitness option - I liked jumping when I was younger.And it is very slow! Very very slow! You will get bored with this rope rather fast and through it in a farthest corner of your room. It will be another thing that you bought, used once and now just keeping.It does not allow much of tricks.I had to buy another one. Actually the 'Everlast Leather Weighted Jump Rope', also from Amazon. And it is way better!The good thing I can tell about this jumping rope is that you can take off some chains and make it shorter - so it is adjustable for height. I've got 8' rope and still had to take 1 or 2 chains off. I am 5 feet and 3 inches tall. So finally, the size was good for me."
1,Too lightweight,The jumpropes at my gym kind of looked like these so I wanted to try them. These are too lightweight. I guess these are the kind that kids play with. I wanted to use it for exercise. Didn't work out.
1,"cheap plastic, really cheap product.","My gym has a few of these jump ropes with the plastic tube sections on a rope. This is a cheap knockoff, not the quality of the other jump ropes that I've used. I'm disappointed in it, sending it back. Sigh...."
3,Just OK,"We weren't expecting a top notch jumprope based on other reviews. We got what we expected. The plastic beads began to break within a few uses. It does the trick, though, and keeps my boys entertained."
5,My son loves Mater and Cars so this is perfect!,Cute movie to keep my son occupied in the car or at a restaurant! He loves anything associated with the Cars movie so this is perfect to have on hand!
1,Live audience kills shows,"It happened to this show, it happened to Happy Days. It happened to every show that went live. Imagine if the first two classic seasons of Bewitched had been before a live audience. Well, they wouldn't be regarded as classic seasons.With a live audience everything is so exaggerated, and the interplay between the audience and the actors is not always beneficial to the shows. Audiences egg actors on and cause them to overact or overreact, makes them self-conscience and too eager to please or get laughs. Also, the show gets stuck on location and rarely moves, rarely goes outdoors, nothing.I give Season one 5 stars. This season and subsequent Seasons deserve 1 star only."
3,not as good as i remember,"thank goodness for jack klugman . never realized how much of this show i do not like.forced humor all over the place,mindless over the top plot points and grating and annoying laugh track(so much for the live audience). good points include funny one liners and did i mention jack klugman.this show never was and never will be in the same class as 'all in the family ' or 'the mary tyler moore show'. that said, i look forward to seasons 3,4 and 5.psgary marshall stinks"
5,Just Great!,"Classic episodes that can't be beat! Oscar and Felix at their best. If you're a fan, you won't be disappointed!"
2,not the worst book I've ever read,"I can't decide what I liked least about this book. The overused vulgarities? The jargonese? The plot? If I ever encounter this plot again, I'll put the book down. Oh, well. At least Holtzer didn't bump off any of her sleuth's nearest or dearest."
5,Stuff you thought you didn't remember,"I love this game. There is no better way for a group of '80's kids to spend an evening. Memories come rushing back with every question. And, unlike other games that give a huge advantage to the person who had no life and spent every waking moment watching TV, this game is fair to all because player chooses the level of difficulty for the question.If you like trivia (even if you're not that good at it) this is a great game. I bought one for myself, and then bought one for all my brothers and sisters."
3,Jump Rope,"Bought this as a double dutch jump rope. It's very hard to use the plastic cased jump rope. Would recommend an actual ""rope"" jump rope."
1,This is not for kids!,"I bought this for my son, who is doing a report for school on paintballing. When he started reading it, he alerted me to several profane words on the first page- this book is absoulutely filled with foul language. It is most definitely not for kids, and we'll be sending it right back."
3,Chutes and Ladders,"Toddlers love this game. My son is three years old and began talking about the ""morals"" on the game board right away. At the top of a slide a girl has a pan of cookies, and at the bottom of the slide, she feels sick. He can understand from this that if you eat too many cookies, you feel sick. Unfortunately, this board game version did not last more than two days without being ripped. The board is delicately folded and only has a small section to hold it all together. It ripped into two pieces when an eleven year old tried to fold it to fit it back in the box."
3,"While not the best book, it's certainly a good introduction to new patients","This book is on the old side - there has been a lot of great and amazing research since it was first published. However, it can provide patients that have just been diagnosed with Fibromyalgia a good, basic understanding of what they are facing. It should not be considered to be a complete reference."
2,Password Journal,My daughter has not gotten to use because of the voice recognition. I will have to reset because it picked up background noise. Be sure there is complete quiet when recording voice.
1,Dad where is the receipt !!!!!!!!,This is the worst toy ever made. The people who wrote reviews with a star higher that two have either had the toy for less than a week or they know something we don't. This toy is for people who can solve a cube when there is a different color on every on every line. It's not for those of us who want simple fun.
1,Annoying,This toy won't open up. It is really bad. If you are really interested in it like I !!!was!!! then you might want to read all the reviews like i didn't do. All the tips for opening it works sometimes.
5,I love Password Journal 3!!!!,"I got Password Journal 3 for my birthday and it was the best present I got! At first it was kind of hard to open, but now I'm used to it. The great thing about this is when its locked you can just leave it out in the open and no one can read it. It looks like its good for writing at night, but I share a room so my sister would be able to hear my password. Overall, I love Password Journal 3!!!!!!!"
1,Password Journal 3,This toy is a complete piece of garbage. I wish I read these reviews before I bought it. My 8 year old is very disappointed with this product. It never opens up to the voice prompt. We tried different passwords and also several people tried it. It NEVER worked.
1,Absolutely Horrible!!,"Many many attempts, and not a single success setting this up to recognize my daughter's voice. I got it to work with mine ONCE, and then it stopped completely working for either of us.I find it pathetic that people are actually giving their digital voice recorders to their kids in order to get this lousy product to work.I guess I can file this under my ""Buyer Beware"" category, but how do you explain that to a very dissapointed 7yr old girl on Christmas night? Well, I guess she could use a bit more scepticism..."
2,Not worth the money,My 7 year old had to have this toy. After much frustration it has been sitting on her shelf untouched for a year. It is almost impossible to open with the voice password. I should have saved my money.
3,Awesome,This toy is the coolest toy you would ever buy. You would not have to worry about anybody getting in to it or anything. I wish all journals would be like this. Im not just saying this to be saying this I'm foreal!!Chelse
1,An unhappy customer,"We bought this journal for our daughter's 8th birthday. She loves writing in journals, she has about a dozen little notebooks so we got this thinking she would love it. She was so excited when she got it. We read the instructions and did everything according to the directions and could not get this to open for anyone. We kept trying for two days and it maybe opened once or twice. My daughter excitement turned quickly into frustration. We were very disappointed and returned it the next day. I would not recommed this toy."
2,not for under age 10,My daughter has one and she will even tell you not to spend your money on it. She never could get it to open.The voice has to be exact each time and my daughter was 9. Its a hard plastic that makes it uncomfortable to write in it.
1,don't buy,I thought this toy would be fun when I bought it. When I opened it and put my password. I closed it and the next time I tried to open it it wouldn't open. I had to break it open and it does't have a voice actived light. Don't waist your money on a peice of junk like this. I suggest that you should get a regular journal that you open up with a key. If you want to buy somthing buy somthing good.Thank you for reading this important message.Lauren
2,Frustrating!!!,"I love the toy, but if I could get into it easier it would be much better. I always have trouble getting my password to work!"
1,this stinks bg time !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,this stinks because it will not open to my voice. the first day I got it I decided to put my money inside so nobody could steal it. but when i went to get my money i could not get it .so i end up smashing it open.and if decide to buy it your wasting your money . i recommend you not buy this stuipid toy.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!thank you
1,PASSWORD JOURNAL - DON'T GET IT,I got password journal on Christmas. I wanted it but then I realized it was very difficult to get your password in and to work by saying your password the same way. I was very frustrated. I cried so please I don't want people to waste their money on buying password journal or wishing for one. Good luck if you get it.
1,Password-less Journal,"My daughter just had to have this, she spent about an hour trying to get it to work and of course there were plenty of tears because it just wouldn't consistantly open. Between resetting it, pulling out batteries and trying to do it myself (unsuccessful too) I just think I'll be returning it. She is very upset, but I can't get it to work, it is a worthless toy."
5,It's bigger than I thought!,"Bigger is better, right? This map is great, we use it in our English as a Second language Program and we love it! Although the paper is somewhat thin, it still works."
4,review world map,"the map itself is nice, according to the picture. however, the packaging was not right, because i have received the map all crisped up."
3,INCORRECT LISTING,"Notice to anyone wanting a map the size listed...it is NOT 32 inches...it is 30 inches. I purchased this product for a craft and had all of my materials to fit this particular size, only to be surprised when I went to put it all together. The map was not the size listed. The seller, in their defense, was quite apologetic and offered to work with me however they could. They stated that they have asked Amazon to change it many times to no avail. The map itself is beautiful and would have been wonderful for what I was planning to make. I have since ordered a framed map from the same company and am hopeful that it will meet expectations. The shipping was fast, and emails regarding the size, etc. were answered promptly and courteously, and despite the fact that I had already cut the map, they offered me a full refund. I was very pleased with the company, just disappointed that the craft didn't work out because the size listed was incorrect."
4,its very beautiful,"i really love this map, its huge and full of color that is not overpowering. the only bad thing i would say about it is that its pretty thin paper and because of its size i fear it ripping if i just hang it as is. I dont want to laminate it because i feel like that would take away from its beauty but haven't found another solution yet"
4,Small Issue But Handled Well,Printer arrived on time but with a broken paper tray. Contacted seller and made arrangments to have replaced. Transaction was easy and went well.
1,Amazon lies! Don't buy.,"Amazon advertises Vista certified and even says software is in the box. It's for XP of 2000 only. It will not install on Vista and HP does not have software available. It will only print with Vista, nothing else. This review is really targeted at Amazon. The printer works great for XP users."
1,Too Old,Aviation consumer is noted for the quality of their reasearch and information. This book as sold by Amazon is too old to be of any use. Your money is better sepent elsewhere
4,A new edition is coming out-Hold On!,"This is a wonderful book, but the new, eighth edition is to be published in 1999. Hold Off!"
4,"Loving my ""BANCO DEL MUTUO SOCCORSO"" CD's","My first Banco album was the American version by Manticore 1975, bought in the Republic of Panama and I've waited 18 years for the CD's. This is a gorgeous prog-rock Band,even though I don't speak Italian,but never the less always enjoyed the sound of this group. Nocenzi and Di Giacomo perform with a musical craftsmanship typical from the 70's era in a wonderfull way, like early Yes, Genesis and Emerson Lake and Palmer. Their self-titled album ""Banco del Mutuo Soccorso"" from 1972 I recommend if you like this one. A Banco fan forever. ""Io sono nato libero"""
4,WORKS GREAT,Low cost pump for pumping out my hot tub - lightweight - easy to handle. Compare price at Home Depot - $25.00 more - Amazon comes through again.
4,pump,good little pump - use it to drain a large fountain - make sure you have a very straight hose - any kinks or sharp bends will prevent it from pumping. pumps a little slower then advertised.
3,They work fine,Not as warm as I was expecting. I had to use the two I bought in order to survive the winter.
1,KTT,"Product FeaturesBrand New Queen SizeMeasurements 200cm x 240cm (78"" x 90"" inches)Made from 100% AcrylicComes with Plastic Carrying CaseMade in Korea BUT in the Product Description It made in china and weight only 5lb instead of 13lb."
3,Not bad,"It sheds a lot of fur; but it is cheap. Overall, I would buy again. You get what you pay for."
3,Sheds more than a husky,First time using it and it sheds ALL OVER. My bed is now covered in black fur bunnies. I guess I'll have to wash this and see if the shedding continues. Is no one else experience this issue? I bought this because of all the positive reviews.It is a warm and soft blanket none-the-less. It also has an unsightly huge tag sewed into it. I looks like it can be easily removed though. It would be nice if it didn't have it in the first place.
3,mink blanket,"I thought I had made a terrible mistake in buying this because it smelled like plastic, but after I found out I wouldn't get much of a refund(shipping was an issue) I aired it out and am happy I kept it! It's very heavy and the color is dark. Read the instructions, though, before you wash it(I don't plan to try!)"
1,Another bad Tori Amos interview cd!,I love Tori Amos interviews. Especially ones where I can hear her speak. So obviously I was really excited when I bought this interview CD. Here's the stinger. You will only hear Tori talk a few times. It is narrated by some English woman. All the Tori speaking parts are taken from the interview used on the In Conversation Tori Amos interview CD. So if you want to hear the original interview buy that CD instead. Most of the facts that were supposedly researched for this CD are completely untrue. The only plus side is the great photos in the booklet and mini poster you get with the CD. Overall I wouldn't even recommend this for a hardcore Tori fan since most of the information is not correct.
4,If it's good enough for Nick....,"I first heard this track when Nick Warren finished his set with it in September 1999, at Heaven Nightclub, Canberra. I still like it for the same reason I did then: a dark and dramatic introduction followed by a nice build, eventually building to one of the best up-tempo breaks you'll hear. It's very uplifting and certainly had the crowd jumping that night. An epic, up-tempo track which works best towards the end of a set."
1,One of Many,"I felt the book was one of many that I have read before. Your mind will take you far, but the rest is pure heart. Your fate is your own creation. I thought people relied too much on angels and their ability to shape their lives."
4,Great Pinball Game With little Flaws,"I started to get into these Plug N Play/TV Games made by Jakks Pacific and Radica Games, and had to pick up the Pinball one. I love pinball games, and this is a great outlet for me. There are a lot of classic features in these, and the replay value is outstanding. Its always fun, and its just a controller, so I can take it wherever I want without it being a nuisance.There are only a few minor flaws Ive found. 1) Jakk's Pacific should have gotten liscenses from Midway/Bally to get some real pinball tables like PinBot. 2) The High Score does not save once the controller is off. This is a major drawback when trying to play to beat your previous highscores.Other than that, this is an amazingly little setup. Ide recommend picking it up if you enjoy Pinball."
1,Terrible,"Save your money! 3 tables, all terrible, slow and muddled. I could not make out anything, especially the ball. Put your money towards a PC Pinball game, namely Microsoft and Atari's Pinball Arcade-MUCH more like real pinball than this crap!"
1,For Nan Curtis - contacting the publisher,"Hi Nan - The book publisher has a website where you can email them, though they do not list a phone number. The site is ...unitedresearchpubs.com and there is a ""contact us"" page.I am really sorry they took advantage of you that way."
3,Good music for a great cause.,"While not the best of the Pavarotti and Friends collections (every year the tenor gathers the world's finest artists for a benefit concert in Italy for WarChild, to benefit children...), the performances are genuine. There's a little something for everyone, but probably not a lot for any single listener. P&Friends 3 is your best bet overall if you only want to buy one of these collections... *By the way: There's only one artist beside Luciano who has appeared on every one of the 6 releases--Zucchero. And for good reason. The man is a consummate blues/rock/pop artist, and his entry on this album is a highlight."
4,"Ha, ha...blah, blah","You will buy the CD for half of it, and never listen to the other half...no, I don't mean that one of the two is bad. It's just that in a collection as varied as this, you're bound to find about ten songs you love and ten more that you hate. Some of the songs suffer from being jokes that are utterly too long - by the time you reach the punchline, you've skipped to the next track. Others manage to keep you well entertained until then (""The Ballad of Irving"" comes to mind). And still others are just a riot the whole way through (Tom Lehrer's two songs instantly come to mind). The moral is - listen before you buy, and figure out if you like enough of the songs to buy the discs. Don't just take someone else's word."
5,a good laugh for sure,This CD can bring a smile to your face when you're in the worst mood. The jokes are great and the songs are a hoot! A must-buy!-Lulu
5,disc 2 is different as a mp3 download,"I thought I would mention that amazon.com offers this 2 disc set as a seperate MP3 download, $8.99 for disc 1 & $8.99 for disc 2. But, the odd thing is, disc 2 of the mp3 download has different songs then what is described on this page. So, you might want to check both versions, to see which is the one you'd prefer...."
2,Not all my cup of tea,"OK, so it's a sweep of twenty years of novelty songs, but the later ones suffer from the general concept of recent humour being cynical and slutty."
1,Read the descripton carefully,"These bits are for wood only and no where in the description are you told. They are not even quality wood bits. They grab and splinter, very poor quality. Total waste of money."
5,Very interesting,"This is my first experience with this artist but it is quite the interesting one! It isn't exactly like anything I've heard, so I can't say that you will like it if you like artist XYZ, but I can say that I was lead on a tangent from some Celtic artists.The first song on this album caught me instantly, immediately after listening to it, I went and looked them up through iTunes and purchased it. After listening through a few songs, I can confidently give them a perfect 5 out of 5 stars. Original, beautiful vocals with instruments that are just as rich and drawing...this is a great artist that doesn't fit neatly into any category. I would encourage anybody interesting to listen to the samples, there is a good chance you will pick it up and enjoy it just as much as myself."
4,Another consistent album.......take a chance.,"On with their tradition of doing something different these guys are back in full force with Zoo Hypothesis, their 3rd album. 16 songs at under 40 minutes this album covers alot of ground and is very interesting to say the least. Fans of Mr. Bungle,SOAD,DFD and MSI will enjoy this gem. I also highly recommend their two previous albums as well. This music is off the mainstream path. WAY OFF............"
1,very disappointed!!,"I bought this game for my daughter because they said with was for 3 and up. well when i recieved it on the box says 5+.. very disaappointed. She tries to play it and she gets very frustated cause she cant do it. People wrote that the graphics were amazing, and they are not! i have to rig it up for it even to play it without the screen turning black. We bought the spongebob one and it works amazing! would recommend that one but not this one. I feel like i wasted 20 dollars!"
4,Fun Christmas present.,"I bought this for my 4 year old granddaughter for Christmas,as she loves to play video games, when she is allowed. She is a very intelligent little girl and catches on to things very quickly.I thought since this was a Disney game with characters from movies she owns, it'd be fun for her. Some of the games were just a little difficult for a 4 yr. old. She probably has mastered them by now, but I was hoping they'd be a little easier for a toddler."
4,Disney plug-in game.,"The Lion King games and the Lilo and Stitch game were fun. The other two games were harder, and are more difficult for a young child. Entertaining for the kids though, and easy to set up for use; just plug into the t.v., turn it on and go."
1,Disney Game not worth buying,"I bought this game for a 4 and 5 year old. The graphics are quite terrible, and the games are not that easy. The kids have more fun playing Pac-Man, Pole Position and Galaga on my other 5-in-1 TV Game. The graphics on the Pac-Man game are far superior to the Disney game."
1,rip off,I purchased this game. I plugged it in and it was in BLACK and WHITE. Iwent to the store and exchanged it. Well guess what...It was in BLACK and WHITE also. I have alot of other plug and play games and they are all in color so I know it's not me or my TV. I will be returning this game for a refund now. Be warned... I am very angry about this. Kids are upset as well.
4,Considering work-at-home? This is a must read!,"As freeways become more conjested and quality child care more difficult to come by, growing numbers of individuals are considering the ""work-at-home"" lifestyle. If you are looking in this direction and want to be well informed before deciding to make the change, this book is a must read. It is brim full of practical suggestions and lists of recommended resources to make your work-at-home adventure a successful one.--Diane Holt, Ph.D., Educational Consultant"
4,Good historical book,If you won't to know about the Battle of Cowpens this book will get you there. It did seem a little repetitive as it did tend to repeat the same information multiple times in trying to provide different views by each group involved in the battle.
3,The definitive book on the Battle of Cowpens,"Objectively, this book represents historical scholarship at his best. The labor the author put into the work is evident. I doubt we can get any closer to the truth of the Battle of Cowpens than what is presented here. There is also a lot of insight into how Revolutionary War battles were fought on the tactical level. However, I think only professional historians, battle re-enactors, or American Revolution junkies could truly ""love"" this book (although many will like it). This is definitely not a ""popular history"" and, as such, the presentation is very dry and frankly sometimes tedious.If you're looking for the straight facts, and lots of detail, get this book. If you're looking for a history that is also ""entertaining,"" you might be disappointed."
5,Excellent Book for Mothers and Children,This is a very good book that opens the conversation to address many of the issues that come up with being a single mother and the child of a single parent. Easy to read and understand and perfect for that 1:1 time.
2,You get what you pay for.,"The speakers sound like tin. If you turn them up past half way, they start to distort. If you bump into the subwoofer the speakers will cut out. Every time you turn on the set there is a loud pop. Don't buy this set."
3,ehh...,the speakers and subwoofers are really great in the beginning. but as you start to use it more and more.they start to wear out.like they lose their power. the subwoofer is still great and all just that the flat panel speakers are weak after given couple boosts of amp and stuff. too weak. needs to be built better. last longer. just my thought.
4,Attractive and speedy!,This little flash drive is very attractive - which is great because I wear it around my neck a lot. It works really well. I only wish it had come with a matching lanyard - I had to pillage one off an old flash drive and it doesn't match. So that's one star off.
5,Uga rules!,"I am a lifelong University of Alabama fan but I have always known and admitted that Uga is - bar none - the coolest dog on the planet. And any dog who bites back at an Auburn player knows his football! My all-time favorite was Uga V and I was thrilled when he was rightfully named the greatest mascot ever by Sports Illustrated and made their cover. I was also excited to see this book.This book is a great overview of the lives of the Ugas, their owners, and the Georgia football program. If you love dogs and college football, you'll love this book."
4,1 of my favorite TV shows -but horrible DVD package,"It sure took a long time for the 2cd season to come out on DVD.I was really looking forward to it.My word.What a HORRIBLE DVD package!!!How the DVD's are packaged inside, hard to get out. Boring, grey, not exciting to look at.YOU HAVE TO PULL OUT THE SHEET TO READ ABOUT THE EPISODES. Too much unnecessary work!!Where are cast interviews? No special features except a ""family tree"".VERY disappointed with this package. I expected a lot more."
3,ok?,"this book is a great tool for both parents and students. for the parent is to set straight the myths surrounding campus life. For the student is to be aware that college is a big step in life, but that should not stop you for going to college. I would recommended this book as an ice breaker for students too shy to talk about troubles they have and to use it as a reference point for themselves because anything that there planing on doing might have already been done. so on that note all i can say is ""will this affect me longer that i think it will"""
2,Not enough Bass,"The Front speakers are great, but the sub and rear speakers are Bad. I have to buy a new sub and replace the old one to appreciate the bass of music. The ""wireless"" rear speakers are not REALLY wireless and it sound terrible. so if your looking for sound and doesn't need a upconvert dvd player don't buy this."
3,OK sorter...,"I think this sorter is marketed to babies starting at 9 months, but my son didn't start playing with it at all until he was a year old. The holes on the sides don't make a lot of sense--kids use the top. The sorting objects are nice and provide different textures and sounds."
2,It's Nice...Until It Breaks Within a Year,"I found that this model met a lot of my needs, and I really liked it at first. Less than a year later, however, the cartridge jammed to the right of the machine and quit working. We had a warranty at that time, so we turned it in and ended up with a refurbished one. Now it is less than a year later and the machine has the same problem with the cartridge stopping on the right. I am a home school mother, and it is important for me to print papers up on demand. It is a very big inconvenience for me to lose a printer and not be able to print work out. The last HP printer we had did not do this in all of the years we had it. I am very disappointed in this printer and would think that HP would have fixed this problem long ago. I wonder if I will even get a credit toward another printer for all of this inconvenience, but honestly I doubt it. I think I will be looking into a different brand of printer for my next purchase."
2,print carriage jam...arrghh!!,I have the same carriage jam that most of the other respondents are complaining about. I've had the printer about 2 years and only used it sparingly(2-4 pages a month). I go to use it one day and I get the error. I printed a total of about 100 pages before the printer took a s**t. That works out to about $2/page. No more HP for me.
5,The Threat,"A typically excellent read by David Poyer. Through Dan Lenson's eys, David Poyer shows us the many faceted sides of military life in today's Navy..."
5,"""the Shooters"" is a fast read.","""The Shooters"" by Leon Claire Metz is a must-read for any fan of the Old West.The author covers both the popular and relatively little-known gunman in a book that is informative and witty.Some of the characters in this book are the ones you'd expect(Billy the Kid,the James gang,Wild Bill Hockok,the Daltons)then there are others that I knew very little about;Tom Smith,Dave Mather,John Larn.Mr.Metz wrote a book that gives details about the lives of these gunman without making it boring.Great book!This book was what I hoped it would be and I recommend it."
5,A must-have for Wild West Enthusiasts,Leon Metz is a true gem for anyone who is studying the Old West. Anybody that watches the History Channel documentaries on the Old West should recognize his name. Shooters is richly funny detailing the lives of all noteable outlaws in the Wild West. I would highly recommend it to anyone who loves the Wild West.
4,Good trash bags,"The box says these are ""tall kitchen bags.""I don't have a tall kitchen, but I use them anyway.I have had problems in the past using bags of similar design from other manufacturers, because the handles can be so insubstantial that they tear easily. But the Hefty handles are hefty enough to get the job done. I have found few defective bags during the many years I've been using this product.I've had trouble finding these bags at local stores, so I was happy to be able to order them from Amazon. I gave the product only 4 stars because the price is high. But I suppose you get what you pay for."
5,My son loves this software!,"This was my son's first software program and he loves it! We have now had it for over a year and he still likes to play it. This software helped him learn numbers, letters, shapes, animal sounds and matching skills. Completing an activity quickly rewards the child with a fun song or visual graphics, so it keeps him very entertained and motivated to keep playing. We've tried several other software programs and this one was definitely the most popular one we've tried, and also the one from which he learned the most."
2,"nice, but out of date",It looks nicely designed. A baby can use it without having to know how to use the keyboard and mouse. But it crashes Windows XP.
2,Displeased!,"These pads are not thick enough to say they are suppose to be super pads; however, these pads are good if you are going to use them as a pantyliner but they are very thin and because of that you will need to constantly change them on your heavier days. If you are looking for super absorbent pads these are definitely not the ones to purchase I would only recommend them to use as pantyliners."
1,"Out of Date ""WIRELESS"" Description",This product is caled a WIRELESS intercom. Today one would expect that such a device would work by means of radio frequency communication. Well that is not how it actually does work. In the small print you are told that it will only work if each unit is on the same electrical circuit. So it requires the house wiring to communicate between the units. This results in the units only working if they are in the same or posible adjacent rooms. In my house we have an electrical service panel with 36 circuits. This give us one chance out of 36 in being able to contact one unit from another that is randomly / remotely installed in our residence. This item should be withdrawn from sale as it is functionally useless.
3,great to talk but lots of static on intercom,"I live in a 3 story row home. We bought these so that we could monitor the baby's room and be able to talk to each other between floors. The system works over the electrical system so you don't have to worry about picking up other people's conversations. The monitor feature (at least on our house electrical system) produces a lot of static. However, the static is not bothersome when using the 'talk' feature. The other 'problem' with using the electrical system is that the monitor cannot be plugged into a circut that has a UPS or a surge bar on it."
1,One problem,"The song brain damage seems to be a complete rip of Iggy Pop's The Passenger, which is a fantastic song. I have not heard anything else on this album and though brain damage was certainly well played, a 1 star is warranted for completely cribbing a song. When I say completely, I mean it's not even close."
2,Sounds familiar...,"Two siblings are taken to a magical land where they find that they are perhaps destined to overthrow the evil witch and rescue the talking animals from the eternal winter that the witch has imposed on them.Thus is the plot of this book, set in the land of Narnia--oops, I mean Ithrea. If you've read The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe by C.S. Lewis, you undoubtedly recognize the story. The main problem with The Doomspell is that it fails to become anything more than a meager copy of The Chronicles of Narnia geared for somewhat older readers."
2,"Weak, little decent information","This Craps title isn't worth your time. It's full mostly of stories about craps players, and vague advice on the potential of dice control. The centerpiece of the book is the highly touted '5-count', which is nothing more than a betting system that gives you no chance of diminishing the house edge. Get Sharpshooter's book instead."
2,Flute,It was what I expected. I purchased it for my 5 year old grandson. Now I will have to show him how to use it.
1,Garbage!!!!!!,"The book is for people who hate Bush, other words for democrats who sit and wait for a moment to jump on PRESIDENT's throat. People buy it because they know it is going to support their views... The book is a complete garbage, full of nonsense and without facts.The book is written for DEMOCRATS!!!! If you have your own brain don't waste your money and time reading it. Spend this money for something more valuble...My rating is not 1 star,but O stars.P.S. I hope Bush wins in 2004, because he knows what he is doing and goes for what he really believes, not like democrats who don't have their own opinion and go only with what the rest of the world thinks about them!!!"
2,STOP T H I E F !!!!!!,"I was very alarmed by this book! Until I started reading it, that is. Initially, I thought some stealer of thoughts (Deanerini) had written of my supposedly forgotten ""affair"" at the Watergate Hotel. A few (seven) martinis and an unfortunate meeting with a shortish (4""7') redheaded trollope visiting from St. Louis resulted in Hoppy's first hotel eviction and a night on the lam. Nevertheless, this book does not tell of that Watergate incident or anything like it.Instead, you get some clipped, sloppy writing by a face I remember from the tv something like 30 years ago. The title is misleading as the incident described in the book is nothing like Watergate (and certainly not worse--could anything be?). And besides, there is no mention of Redheaded Rita the bullrider. Disappointing..."
4,Great speakers! Value for the money!,"These are great looking, ultra compact speakers. For 25 bucks I think these are the best one can get but the sound quality is only above average...Well, you get what you pay for!"
3,Great design falls short.,"Hi-end speakers normally have heavy magnets, so feeling the weight of these speakers made me hopeful. At low volumes the audio was ok and the 3D feature is interesting, but at mid to high volumes they just don't sound good."
1,The Doc,"I bought this piece for the echo cancellation. (I did read the instructions) I haven't found it yet. The people/listeners on the other end of the line continously complain about the echo. They hear me as if I was in a tunnel. While you can use it in both ears, you will still have to completely plug it into your ear to keep it in place. The hook around the ear is just to prevent it from falling out of your ear and onto the ground as it does not hold the apparatus in place for a clear sound/connection. I have it paired with an LG-VX8300 and it does not maintain the connection. I keep on dropping calls. The sound is continously transferred to the phone itself leaving me driving down the road with an earpiece in one ear and the phone in the other. The battery time is less than the promised two hours.The pros: small, small, small...."
2,It's a snap! ...and not a good one.,"Volume does indeed get pretty high, and in-ear type bud does work well in a car. However, I had to keep bending the ear hook to try to get a comfortable position. Ultimately, after just a few months, the ear hook metal fatigued and snapped, rendering the device useless.For those of you who might say ""well, you idiot, you shouldn't have bent it"", I would reply that a little bit of plastic coating over the thin coat hanger type wire would have made the problem moot. I've used numerous other bluetooth earpieces over the last several years, and this is the first time I've come across one that actually snapped!If I am to be complete here, I should also add that the charger is quite finicky to connect. However, in a positive development, it did not, in fact, break."
3,Ok for LG Phone,"This is the 4th bluetooth headset I've tried with my LG phone and it by far has the best reception. It's also comfortable to wear. The downside is that the button isn't very user friendly. I've had the device for a few weeks now and still have trouble turning that darn thing on and off as well as transferring calls. The difference between all these operations is (according to the manual) whether you hold the button briefly, for two seconds or for five seconds. What's briefly? There's no great blue/red lighting system on there to clearly indicate if the device is on, off or charging."
1,Fatal Flaw,"LG uses a proprietary connector for the charger. I misplaced my charger and tried to replace it but I was not able to find a replacement charger with the correct connector. I bought another headset instead (Motorola) with a universal mini connector. While the LG headset performed satisfactorily (not perfectly, by any means), I would not recommend it because of the proprietary connector. There are plenty of good headsets that use a universal connector allowing you to use many different chargers. Now I carry one plug-in and one car charger and use them for both my phone and headset. Anybody need an LG HBM 730 headset - cheap (charger not included)?[Footnote: for some reason, Amazon has 3 separate listings for the LG HBM 730]"
1,Warning for Windows 95 users,"The system requirements are misleading for this 2002 version, this software will not install on Windows 95 as listed. Wouldn't it be refresh to tell you that tech support apologized and quickly did the right thing - NOT !"
3,"Beware, not good for wider people","You get to use only 12"" section of this footrest, where the wheels are. If your legs spread wider like mine (either you have wider hips or wider thighs), your feet will slide from the sides (notice there is no friction material on either side)! Bad design in my opinion. Measure the breadth of your legs in a relaxed state before you buy any footrest, or you will end up crossing your legs, which puts stress on your knees."
4,happy feet,"This was a gift for my Daughter for Christmas. She loves it! We all use it though because it is at the computer desk in our kitchen. We have throughly enjoyed it. It is very useful both as a foot prop for my younger son and as a massager for myself. I run which makes my feet really sore. It is nice to get a soothing foot massage while I check my email at night. The only reason I didn't give it five stars was packaging. When it arrived, the box was open on both ends because no packing tape had been used to secure the box closed. Thankfully all of the parts were inside. Very easy assembly."
5,"The life, times, and scores of video games.","I like to congratulate Walter Day on his achievement. This book is exactly what the video game world needed. Finally, a book that tells about the history of video games from the very beginning of the golden age to the present .Also, a complete listing of high scores and contest scores that helps complete this amazing book. I strongly recommend this book to anyone and everyone that enjoys playing video and pinball games. I should know, I my self have been competing in video games for twenty years now and hold several world records. Congatulations again Walter, I look forward to more in the future."
1,Durable until it is taken out of the package,"I bought this for my 7 year old son. It did not take long before the A and B buttons became stuck in the down position. The games were not that challenging for a 7 year old. But he thought it was great when the A and B buttons fouled up, he said it made it more of a challenge. Dad thinks the thing is a piece of crap."
5,The First Two From Judy Collins,"Many years ago, I owned both of these LP records. It is GREAT to see them re-issued on CD. The first four recordings are perhaps the very best from Judys' ""folk period"". (see my review of 3 & 4)There are some minor technical problems on the first record (not bad, but noticeable), no doubt due to the age of the original tape. If you are a fan of folk-era music, this CD is a must !"
1,Condition of product,It arrived to me with the numbers on the front coming off. I wanted them to replace it and have not recieved it and it has been a couple of weeks. They also said they charge 6$ for sending it back. It wasn't my fault the product was in good shape. They have not e-mailed me or anything on this matter.
1,pass on this one!!,"I was really disappointed in the content of this book. The bookwas not very family friendly. A lot of the material reviewed was common knowledge. The only highlights were the web sites and phone numbers for stores that specialize in storage space. The book was not very practical. How many people in real life are going to hire an expert to help with organizing our homes?I think that this author may have insight on how to help with basic organization. However, if you are a mother who needs advise on how to manage organizing your house while working, cooking, cleaning and spending time with your family I would pass on this one. Unless of course you want to hire an expert to remodel your kitchen for 22,000 dollars. (This was one of the options for organizing your kitchen.) I just need help on how to keep my kitchen drawers clean!"
1,Waste of Time,This book reads as a 280 page advertisement for various online organizing and storage retailers. They also throw in such helpful hints such as: fold your clean towels before putting them in the linen closet and keep a pad and paper next to the phone for messages. I finished the book mostly for the amusement factor. I still don't know what they intended by their suggestion that we store our HAIR in the cabinet under the bathroom sink! Don't waste your time or money on this book.
4,"Music is Great , Liner Notes Stink","Good overall collection of tracks, some of which are very hard to find anywhere else, including the Strangeloves, Cat Mother, the Standels, and The Midnighters. The later is not even listed as being charted by Joel Whitburn. God knows where Rhino got this.The Liner Notes are below par for Rhino. There is no composer information and no dates of the tracks. I had to look those up myself. However, there are nice photos and brief bios of the artists.Another irritating point, and this cost me a good 30 minutes of time, was the fact that when ripping this to the computer or iPod, the CD insists upon listing ""various artists"" as the artist on the track. I had to go back and manually change the files in the computer and on iTunes."
1,What ! No Dixie?,"""Songs of the Civil War"" without ""Dixie"" is like all-time Christmas carol favorites without ""Silent Night."" Is this political correctness, or what?"
5,Honor's Kingdom,This transaction was smooth and quick. The book was all I could hope for and was in better condition than I expected. I am glad to have the book to add to the other Owen Parry books that I own.
5,Great Information for Planning and Hosting a Variety of Successful Showers,"The information in this book is very thorough, covering the many different types of showers. The timeline planner/checklist is very helpful in staying on track and not missing important details such as mailing invitations in a timely manner. Wonderful recipes are included for desserts, drinks, hors d'oeuvres, and main course items. The detail in each section of the book is excellent. For example, the chapter covering ""Bridal Shower Themes"" not only gives clever themes, but also includes extensive lists of gift suggestions.I recently hosted a shower and used several of the games Ms. Clark recommends; they were a lot of fun. I definitely recommend this book.J.H. Sweet, author of The Fairy Chronicles"
2,Magic?,"I thought it sounded like a fun thing, but there were no instructions on how to use the ""magic"" deck."
1,Useless,"I am looking for something to replace my old acupuncture point locator and this is not what I am looking for. Although it comes with a big screen, this thing is extremely difficult to use."
4,More than meets the eyes,"This book is a must for every parent, sibling, love one, estranged neighbor, co-worker, health care giver, and clergy dealing with mixed feelings regarding partner preferences. From the sunny 60's beach fests to Katmandu, and to front seat vision of the Maharishi. The chapters are brief and complete and leave a lingering presence of genuine experience. In open candor the author graciously projects a vivid landscape without shame and stirs warm memories not just for the LA native or transplant, but any American who truly loves our freedoms."
4,take that live,"fantasic and fun performances of take that live. this is minus robbie williams but the vocals are strong and the sets are over the top. it has a few moments of corney, but overall it is watchable. i am not big on circus themed anything, but there is enough distraction and good harmonies that you can easily get distracted!"
2,Poor Quality,Shuffler top plastic cap was misshaped. Would not stayin position to allow card shuffling. Had to put rubberbands around unit to have it stay in place to shuffle.Will probably buy local in future for return convenience in the event of problem like this.
1,how could someone listen to this now?,"I believe the main attraction to this cd, and the Dead Kennedys in general is their political intentions, rants and over all passion for what they believe in. Something the ex-members of the band certainly forgot when they sued Alternative Tentacles. This cd isn't any better than the old AT version, infact it's worse. How can you listen to it and not feel dirty and hypocritical? Nothing on this cd means anything anymore, not to say the original release means nothing as well, just this cd. It's a crying shame."
1,DO NOT BUY THESE REMASTERED RE-RELEASES!,Buy the original Alternative Tentacles releases. They sound better!!!
4,dead kennedys the best,i never knew about real punk rock until a year ago. i was buying blink 182 and other stupid bands like that until i searched preppie on kazza. i heared terminal preppie and was amazed. i love DK. good cd. i like # 21 it is like a remix from the first album starts of jazz then starts being anarchy. buy this cd.
5,Encouraging and enjoyable,Witty account of a woman with a positive attitude! Would like to read more of Wilder's work. Have already shared my copy.
3,A joy to read.,"Cute, funny, poignant, sad, etc.--all the adjectives you would expect to describe a book like this. Effie Wilder takes us on a tour of the retirement home and introduces us to her friends and acquaintences. Being able to take people's stories and use them to make people smile is what makes books such as this so endearing and special to read."
3,Yes-Millenium,The sound was not as good as i thought it was going to be. But Yes has always been one of my fav bands. I will keep it in my collection.
4,Meh...,"This is a movie I had to watch twice. The first time I watched it, I was just annoyed with the acting or was it just the character's personalities, I don't know. And then I was so annoyed that she was with two guys at the same time. BUT after seeing that twist in the end that changes everything, I had to rewatch and then the movie was better and I wasn't annoyed and I liked it enough for 3 and a half stars, but the twist is smart so I bump it to four."
3,"Will watch it again, worth my time","The movie's about a girl who gets two guys' numbers and goes out with both of them so she can decide which one she likes better. Some thing which I think is an interesting idea, but not sure if you can do it in real life like this. But the story has refreshing and unexpected turns, a handful of endearing performances, and a smart, optimistic attitude."
1,"Terrible, terrible movie","This movie, My Girlfreind's Boyfriend is one of the most disgusting, boring, outright horrible movies that I have seen in a very, very long time. I picked this up expecting something funny to watch and both me and the person I am with hated every shot of every frame of the movie. It is a failure as a comedy and as a romance. Do not watch this peice of garbage."
5,A discussion format packed with thought-provoking opinion!,"Late Discovery Adoptees, Donor Insemination people, and all Triad members, take note! This book is not to be missed. All those touched by adoption/DI speak their voice, uncensored. I loved this book because it touched on many timely topics. In a world where Bush is tying to ban gay marriages, this book talks about whether on not gays should have the right to adopt. All opinions are expressed and some I certainly don't agree with. I read it in one afternoon. The poetry is all original and very touching.Meredith, DI mother of three, three different donors"
5,Valuable insight,"Thank you so much for sharing your experiances with dating and marrying a widower. I've been searching for information for a year as I have been dating a wonderful widower myself. While I feel hopeful, you have clearly outlined potential problems and given voice to some of my innermost feelings. Bravo!"
1,Offensive!,"I am a young widow and I was deeply offended by this book. One suggestion written was to ""accidentally"" break the Christmas decorations belonging to the deceased wife, so that the widower could no longer use them. I am so glad that I borrowed this book from the library instead of putting money into this ""author's"" pocket. She's no author. All she did was combine stories written by other widow/ers that were posted on online chat groups. Did you receive permission for all those excerpts Ms. Andersen? This women has also been sending emails asking everyone to write a favorable review for her book, especially since her feedback on eBay has turned sour. Can you say ""trolling for feedback""? This book is nonsense and Ms. Andersen simply doesn't have a clue about understanding widows or widowers."
4,This collection truly personifies the band,"Really good mix. If there is one NRBQ release to buy, this is it. The best of a great alternative band from when alternative meant something."
4,trying to keep the faith,"Having heard 'Phil Ochs in Concert' what jumped out at me is the contrastingly darker mood of Phil's verbal intros (set against the aftermath of 'the Chicago experience')and that he might not remember all the words to his songs. His spare guitar contrasts with studio versions with orchestral or rock backings and work to good effect. Appearing at a peace and poetry concert, the interspersed 'non originals' (Highwayman, the Bells) and his 'artier' songs play off against the straight political stuff. Highlight of the concerts are 'The Crucifixion', the intro and performance of 'I ain't a Marching anymore.'"
3,Cute but Thin Material,"Just as the title says, it was very cute design but the material IS a little thin. I had ordered the whole set and orderded this as an additional. Very happy with overall bedding set!"
2,Additives,I bought this thinking that it was pure. There are so many additives that I can't pronounce! Not what I wanted.
4,Nice ending to an entertaining trilogy,"I had read the first two books in the trilogy and was excited to read the last. The book arrived quickly and was in excellent condition. I enjoyed all three books in the Magician Trilogy, but must say, I liked the first book, ""The Snow Spider"" the best."
3,Too much Welsh,"I'm an adult, and I found this book difficult to understand. There was too much Welsh, the names are difficult to pronounce and the tales are too convoluted to follow. Stick with Charlie Bones."
5,10 Weight Silicone Shock Oil,This is a very high quality silicone oil that is made by lucas oil. It is great for anything rc and even better for airsoft guns. It is just as good oil for airsoft gun as the 10 and 15 dollar brands. Overall terrific oil for the price and purpose.
4,Takes a little getting used to...,"I really hate to be one of those fans that will bend to the whims and desires of my favorite artists. But, okay, I am. I ordered Stag and listened to it once and thought, ""eh.. not my thing."" But, knowing how much I love Amy, I thought I should try again. So, I listened to it for a week straight, and loved it. It sounds different from what you're used to hearing from the Indigo Girls. But, I love that edgier feeling, and sometimes you need it. This is a great CD. Amy was awesome live at Slim's in SF. I can't wait to see what's coming next. Still a die hard fan..."
2,Unpleasant albeit very well-written,"The book focuses on various earthy canine activities in somewhat off-putting detail but without really providing good insight into the character of the dog herself.Moreover, the author is irritating as he constantly deprecates other people for their class or appearance.On the other hand, the prose is superb; the sentences classically polished and balanced to a degree rarely seen today. But I felt this just made the contrast with the book's substance dispiriting.The book is primarily useful as a sort of a window into an earlier, more easygoing world - one before leash laws - and for that it may be of interest to some."
1,"Oops, I'll pay closer attention next time.",Beware! This is an MP3 formatted disk. I am unable to use it as my equipment doesn't support that format.
1,Review bests dog,"I can't remember where I read the review that said ""My Dog Tulip"" was among the best dog stories ever. What I do know is the dog story catagory is one in which the competition is fierce and the talent- exceptional so, I immediately ordered it for my husband me, thinking we would love it and it might be a wonderful gift for the many dog lovers in our midst.Aside from the first chapter which was totally charming-- the rest of the book was an endless accounting of Tulip's bowels, heats, and birthings which only a Brit could love. I suspect Tulip would not have been amused ... and neither was I."
5,One of the greatest dog books ever-- a classic,"I bought this for a friend in Florida who like I is crazy about dogs and yet had never even heard of the book. A factual account written in 1956 by the superb author J. R. Ackerley, it is a classic about life with an Alsatian, as the British call German shepherds.. How many books are still available on the market after almost 60 years? I've shared my bed and breakfast with Dandie Dinmont terriers for over 50 years and always looked upon Germans shepherds with trepidation, but my attitude toward them changed after reading ""My Dog Tulip."" And so will yours."
2,Duplicate,"If you already own Best of Raw vol 1 then dnt get this. #1, its only thirty minutes long and #2 they're showing highlightes of highlightes from BoR vol 1."
5,Great album !,Get a copy of this if you can. It is Popa's best live album. You can get it from his site at a reasonable price. Then go see him at one of his shows. You won't be disapointed. I wish he played mote gigs here in the U.S.
3,"The ""Have A Nice Day"" Series","This series has songs that are unavailable on almost all other collections. If you want some of the great ""one-hit wonders"" from the 1970's, then this is the place to go!"
3,Some things useful,"Bought the book as Reich is a talented horticulturist. Some ideas were good, others not. I spent several days and hundreds of dollars in labor laying out newspaper and piling wood chips on top to create a weed barrier. The weeds grew back just as they had before. This was disappointing."
4,Bad guys rule,My 3 year old son received this along with Buzz Lightyear for his birthday. He likes to have battles with the two of them and loves shooting the missiles. Not very educational but good for imaginative play.
4,Clear Eyes,I have used these drops for many years Only found in one store[Walmart] Now they don't carry them anymore Tried other contact lens drops to no avail! Happy to find them on Amazon and at a good price. Yeah!!!!
4,"Not up to some of the others, but still good","This collection isn't quite up to the others, but some really good stuff remains nonetheless from 1969-70. Gene Chandler's ""Groovy Situation"" was greatly loved by those of us who remember listening to the radio at the time, but it's almost forgotten today, so it's good to see it here. The same is true with the Presidents' ""5-10-15-20."" The Spinners' ""It's A Shame"" was written by Stevie Wonder and is representative of his genius. ""War is available elsewhere and the other tunes are just okay, but the good stuff here (and what good stuff it is) makes it worthwhile. Classic Soul, Si! Gangsta rap, NO!"
3,Made holes but didn't eject cores.,"I found the aerator to be sturdy and easy to use, but it didn't work as advertised on my yard. The tubes clogged with dirt and never ejected the cores, no matter how many times I cleaned them out and started over. At first I thought the soil must be too wet because it had rained recently, so I waited a couple of days and tried again. It didn't seem to matter how moist or dry the soil was. The tubes still clogged, no matter what I did, no matter what the soil was like. I finally gave up on expecting the cores to come out, and settled for just punching holes in the soil. The tool did that reasonably well. I figure that making the holes will do my yard some good, even if it's not perfect."
4,lawn aerator,Works good after a proper rain. If it gets clogged just keep plugging and it will free itself. Very easy to use.
4,so far so good,"used 3 times, yard needs to be moist. works pretty good. no complaints. gave it 4 out of 5 cause im one of those picky customers, and it pulls plugs out about 8 out of 10 times. my guess is its as good as any other quality aerator. i am satisfied."
4,Simple & Easy to Use,"We had some water absorption issues with our lawn resulting from overly compacted soils. We picked this aerator to put in some quick drainage holes. It's as simple as you can imagine. You step into that little holster thing with one foot and lean into it. Your weight pushes the aerator into the ground, and you end up with two plugs of dirt. I sometimes have difficulty using my weight to push the tool into the ground but I am only about 110 lbs. My husband had no difficulty whatsoever and thought it was as easy as walking. The only downside may be that it only has 2 prongs rather than 3 or 4 but you just use it more times per square foot."
4,For $10 it's great,I took a class in tree caring and this tool is simple to use. You place it on the area you want to aerate and step on the bar at the bottom. It is suppose to cut a core in the soil thus creating more surface contact area for the air.I saw a previous review about the handle can break. I think the driving force is with your foot on the aerator and your body to weight it down. I'll be cautious about the handle now that I know it can break.I got it at Loews for less than $10. They're at a clearance sale. I wonder if they're redesigning it to have a larger diameter and longer core.
3,"meh, soil needs to be damp","this is a o.k. product if you have a small lawn or LOTS of time the tines do clog quite easily (some sort of silicon coating would have made this a 5 star tool) and you have to learn how damp your lawn has to be in order for it to go smoothly. You might want to wear gloves, holding it for that length of time the outer pads of the hands get a little red and fatigued. Have only had it for a day and can say i completed half of my front lawn in about 45 min. But you have to admit it is much more convenient than going to rent the big hulking machine and lug it back to the store."
1,POOR QUALITY & SERVICE,I purchased this item new and when I received it the top was loose which seems dangerous as it has petrol which is ignited as the source of heat. When I commented on this to the supplier he advised me to use pliers to squeeze the top to make it tighter which did not seem very good to me for a new itemI consider that exciting products are not very good and will not use them again.
1,hidden costs,"When I received the product, operating instructions indicated that a cigar lighter was needed - ""no blue flame"" - because traditional lighters can burn out the heating element. after considerable searching, I found a lighter (expensive, too); however, the hand warmer is very difficult to light. And it tends to ""flame"" for no apparent reason, which leads me to conclude that the heating element has burned out. Both of my hand warmers have stopped working after only 3 - 4 uses.The manufacturers should market an appropriate lighter along with the hand warmer, and make it clear that a specialized lighter is needed."
5,Freakin' great,I just recently heard about Dexter and I can kick myself for that. He is simply amazing. I think I'm going to try and track down some of his earlier work in Flat Duo Jets.
3,Question,"TO THE BEST OF MY KNOWLEDGE, THE XBOX DOES NOT PLUG INTO A CAR POWER PLUG, SO HOW DOES THIS SCREEN MAKE IT MOBILE??"
1,This thing is a rip off!!,Please don't waste your money! The picture is horribe. Most games cannot be played on this because the detail of the picture is so poor and grainy. I got burnt on this one please don't let it happen to you!
1,im 15 plus i found a much better screen for much less,"i found a $60 screen at EB games that attaches to the head rest, it has a bigger screen, runs off the xbox, and is much cheaper"
2,A book that goes nowhere,A book that goes nowhere!It seems to me a book should have a point of view. This book has none. One cannot fathom the author's purpose other than to be an outlet for his thorough knowledge of economics and the current world economy. But knowledge and wisdom are two very different things. The author explains the pros and cons of capitalism over and over and always stops short of picking a side or point of view or reform. Generally he seems concerned about too much capitalism but you never know if this is real or just a necessary artifact to have something to imply beyond mere description. If you missed economics 101 in college or want a general review of the international economy maybe this book is for you. If you want a point of view on what's going in the world try MIlton Friedman's books for an explanation of free trade or Understanding The Difference Between Democrats And Republicans for a point of view on the politics of capitalism
5,ICON,"Truly one of the most underrated 80's metal bands. For anyone who appreciates solid, straight-forward, no B.S. rock, treat yourself to this album (if you can find it), then sit back and compare it to other era bands and draw your own conclusions.I scored this album on vinyl about 15 years ago, and immediately put it on tape (like all my vinyl), and am now in the process of burning CDs to back up my collection. Good thing too, since it doesn't appear to be available anywhere now."
3,OK But Not Very Round,"I got this ball to play handball with my 7 year old son. I probably should have gotten a slightly larger size -- 7"" OR 8-1/2"" -- but this works fine. My only complaint is that it isn't very round. It is no worse than other playground balls I've purchased at other retail stores, but I was hoping for more. It bounces straighter than I would have guessed given it's appearance... I don't know why it's hard to find a playground ball that is actually round."
1,Unimpressed,"Was excited to put this in my basement amongst the background of my battle lan computer area. It however made the garbage can. The image quality is massively distorted and just a level of pure disgust. Totally washed out. Your better off printing the image they have advertising this item and pasting it on the wall... You would probably be happier.To add fuel to the fire, this company, which will be forever boycotted from any future purchases actually had the nerve to put TAPE over the actual picture end side itself to help hold it in its rolled up fashion.. Unbelievable.Unfortunately I bought this prior to moving into a new location and didn't look at the item till a few months after I bought it.. So wont bother for a return, but I can say to you, pass this up like the plague!"
4,Seventies Music Fanatic,"I first heard Delaney & Bonnie in the early seventies when me and my friends would meet after school to listen to classic seventies music.It was really cool rediscovering this overlooked duo who deserved to have achieved so much more , after all the great Eric Clapton was a big fan and launched their career with the phenomenal live album on tour featuring a host of legendary musicians.Why people stopped buying their records remains a mystery.Anyway back to this album which does'nt have a single dud on it and should be owned by any self respecting 70's rock afficianado.I'm crazy about all the tracks especially the Dave Mason cover "" Only you know & I know "".In short an excellant album with some great rock,blues & gospel.Bonnie has a sweet voice and deserved to have made it bigger.Has she done any solo work or just disappered ? Ultimately it does'nt realy matter as their early output will ensure they remain forever ground breaking legends."
2,needs major design improvements,"Sure, Ms. Pac-Man is just as addictive as it was in the arcade 25 years ago and it's a blast to re-visit the exact same game. BUT unless you have incredibly flexible hands, the design of the actual game box is dreadful. There is no comfortable way to hold it (even if you're ambidextrous). It is not heavy enough to stay put on a table or flat surface on its own. Might Namco consider adding a handle to it, or some other way to keep it stable without cramping your hands? As others have rightly pointed out, the so-called ""twist"" joystick leaves a lot to be desired -- it simply doesn't respond the way a real joystick does. I've never been able to get beyond the second level because of it (on the arcade game I could play for hours). All of this adds up to a lot of frustration and a product that won't get used very often."
2,Joystick sucks ass,The games are great the joystick sucks! I would rather pay an extra $20 and get a real heavy duty joystick like the ones on the standup machines. Otherwise it is pretty good. Joystick is terrible.
1,"Good idea, bad controller",I purchased the Ms. PacMan for my wife who is a huge fan. I like the Galaga feature and we were excited to get started. The first controller I purchased wouldn't go down which was annoying for Ms. PacMan. I took it back and exchanged for another controller which wouldn't go left. Extremely annoying for Galaga. We've given up on the Nostalgia games. Hopefully they'll rework the product so it actually works.
3,NAMCO II NEEDS NO III,"We just bought the new plug-in-play Namco II this weekend. I was excited to see Ms. Pacman and most of all, Pole Position. However, I was very disappointed about the mechanics of the joystick. Ms. Pacman has a mind of her own when it comes to moving in the right direction. It seems that the only way to get her to go the way you want her to is to tap the joystick and then let it reset to the middle before and after every move. And it took a long time to figure out how to steer the car in Pole Position. The default to guessing was to move the joystick right and left, but after reading the directions, it said to rotate the joystick clockwise/counterclockwise. Well, after almost throwing the joystick across the room in frustration, we figured out that you actually have to twist the yellow ball on top of the joystick, left and right. Good luck! The games are still fun, of course, but sometimes they can be frustrating."
1,"Like rest of this series, no replacement for the originals","All of these Jakks Pacific game systems suffer from a terrible cheapness. A great idea but a missed opportunity. If they worked properly (and stayed working) people would love them. As it is, there's just no subsitute for the real thing. Emulations, simulations - they're all just pale copies of the real thing.If you want to experience these great games as they were originally presented and as they originally played you'll just have to seek out a vintage arcade machine. Otherwise you might be fooled into thinking the games weren't as good as you remembered them to be. They are, it's just these new cheap simulations that stink."
4,No quarters needed!,"Being a Ms. Pac Man junkie from way back when, I was excited to finally be able to play a version that was (almost) exactly like the arcade version. The game play speeds up the way it did in the arcade and reaching the junior level and beyond have not been an issue for me the way it seems to have been for numerous other reviewers. I've had no joystick problems. As for the other games on here, The Galaga is just like the arcade. Same goes for Mappy. The Xevious is okay but then I never really played it at the arcade. My only negative comment about this item is that the Pole Position only lets you qualify for and race the first track. Why couldn't we get all the different tracks? That really stinks! Otherwise this is an economical toy that should, barring joystick defects, offer hours of harmless fun."
5,Ms. Pacman and Co.,This toy is a great concept for all of the Atari-lovers out there! The only bummer is that you have to play by yourself.
1,Disappointing,"My boyfriend loves Ms Pac Man, so when I saw this I figured it would be the perfect birthday gift. Buying it was a HUGE MISTAKE because the joystick doesn't work - Ms Pac Man would go straight when you tried to get her to turn (or turn if you wanted her to go straight). At first I thought maybe it was a problem with the unit I purchased, so I exchanged it for another one...same problem. The game was not playable, because you couldn't get away from the ghosts.The problems aren't confined to Ms. Pac Man alone, either. We experienced joystick issues on the other games on this unit.I finally returned the second unit I purchased.I wish I had read the reviews before buying it.Unless you're a glutton for punishment, don't buy this..."
1,JAKKS JOYSTICK SUCKKS!,"Just received my Ms.PacMan tv game today... Talk about a BIG DISAPPOINTMENT! The joystick works great with Galaga & Xevious; but for Ms. Pac Man (the primary game I bought this for), the joystick is utterly useless! It is complete inaccurate and it doesn't go where you want it to go. The main problem is that the joystick is a 8-way joystick and not a 4-way joystick like the original game. 4-way is up,left,right,down. However, 8-way joysticks have notches in the positions between those; often causing the stick to get stuck in an invalid position and ms.pacman not moving...I can't believe that Jakks released this with such a cruddy joystick! I returned this.My recommendation is DO NOT GET THIS! Their pac-man game is good b/c it actually has a 4-way joystick, but not so with ms pac man. :-("
3,old school,"I purchased this for my nine year old son. He seems to enjoy it. At first we couldnt figure out how to play Pole Position. Then I gave up because I figured something was wrong with the joystick. But five minutes later he figured it out. The thing is, you have to turn the joystick instead of shifting it back and forth. When I say turn it I mean hold it (the yellow ball part) and turn it the direction that you want the car to go. This game took me down memory lane. As a child my brother and I used to play with it on our Atari."
2,Great Idea but...,"Like the first in the Namco Plug 'n play series, this is a brilliant idea, and anyone into retro gaming will love these sets.But...I have a real problem with Namco taking advantage of game enthusiasts by dragging their classics out over 'volumes' of these things, instead of giving value for money and putting all the classics on one set. They did the same thing on the PLaystation software series, and I seriously thought they would have learnt how annoying it is for consumers (putting greed ahead of customer value).5 out of 5 for the concept, 1 out of five for Customer treatment (again)."
4,Namco II,Why I rated this toy 3 stars is because of Ms PacMan. Its hard togo up and vertically. Why I didn't rate it 1 star is he likesGalga alot. Galga works alot better then that game. Mappy and Poll Position work good too.
3,Maths made easy,"The book covers a lot of topics, all very well explained. The only bad thing is the pseudocode, is very complicated to understand (the author gave strange names to the variables, and is not easy to follow)"
3,"Decent Live Album, Finally Released!","Every major rock act had to have a live lp in the 70s. Here comes S&C with a passable effort. They rarely improvised, and so the live versions of these tunes have no surprises. But this does capture a great touring lineup for a jazz fusion piece called Thunderfoot. It just sounds great today and this alone makes the purchase worthwhile. Also, S&C resisted knocking out hits here and illuminated some nice albums cuts instead. The fun ""Hog Callin'"" fiddle routine from the concerts is also captured. Carolyn Willis is spotlighted as a third voice."
4,An Abstract Word Picture of History,"Just as one may view an abstract painting, this book is a word abstract of history of a beautiful city. Germain takes her readers on a tour of the city, but it is more than a tour of place but a tour of class, status and the sorrow of the people. Each location is representative of a class of person and the suffering which they have endured.As one born in Prague, it resinated in a very personal way. Germain gives the opportunity for all to experience Prague in a special way.A wonderful book of prose, and reflection. A must read for those who wish to explore life."
5,Great price,"Just what I wanted. Quality and size equal to the cups found in local store. With shipping right to your door,it is nice and easy."
3,Remotes,One doesn't work all of the time. I have one in the bedroom that is fine. The button that you press to go back to the last station you watched works. The one in the living room does not. It is hard to change channels at times. It works when it wants.to.
4,Even a beginner can follow this.,"This video is done so well that having seen it, i would have paid double for it. Over an hour and a half of plain spoken discussion (done in interview style) during the dis-assembly and cleaning of an AR15. I learned more from this video than from all my buddies at the gun shop. This covers virtually everything you'll need to know!"
2,Burns your thumb and leaks like a siv!,This maker is pretty but watch out! When pouring there is a gap between the handle and the lid for the steam to be released. If you place your thumb on the lid while pouring you'll get burned! If you want a coffee pot that won't drip when you're filling your cup this isn't it either. Sorry DeLonghi but this maker is not the best.
1,Too hot to handle!,"I bought this a few month's ago and have regretted it ever since.It makes fine coffee, there is no problem with that. But it is messy. To pour a cup, the lid needs to be held wide open, unless you want to scald your thumb with the steam that escapes between the lid and handle. Then, with the lid held up as you pour, the condensation that has built up under the lid drips onto the counter as you tip the pot.Also the filter basket doesn't fit into it's position without a trial and error method.I'll be back in the market soon for a different pot and don't think i'll consider anything from Delonghi."
3,Would be fine with a different carafe,"The coffeemaker itself works fine and makes decent coffee, but the carafe drips when pouring, especially when full. The lid is also difficult to attach. I have tried six alternative carafes, none of which fit this model. It is inconvenient that the carafe should not be used in the diswasher, too (and, indeed, it doesn't fit in mine)."
2,Cover won't stay on spaceship cockpit,Thought this would be a great toy but the cover/top won't stay on the spaceship so my 4 yr. old son is constantly bringing it to me to put it back on and now he doesn't play with it at all. I would have returned it if I still had the box and the time to hassle with a return.
3,pisces charm review,The charm was satisfactory especially for the price. I was quite happy with it and it was a part of a great present!
3,missions vs treason,I am conflicted - I see the good intention of Christian people to reach to the muslim world with faith in Christ which is mandated by Christ our Lord and yet we are told to obey the laws of our land .. When they are told by the government to leave they aught to leave ... I am not certain how I feel about this film....
1,What Various Artists?,"In all fairness, I must say right off the bat that I have not listened to this album, only to the samples provided on this page. That being said, if this counts as a ""tribute to U2"" I should start recording my shower singing and sell that. Amazon doesn't list who these ""Various Artists"" are, but to me it sounds like the same guy doing a very bad Bono imitation on every track. The music itself sounds like it came from a karaoke machine, and like the vocals, it is a souless note for note, inflection for inflection copy in every way, down to the double tracking of the vocals on Discotheque. Pop your favorite U2 songs on the car stereo and sing along, you'll get more feeling out of it and probably sound better too."
1,One should never buy a service plan,"I bought this for an item I had to return because it came to me in used condition. Whether it is any good or not, remains to be seen, when I have a problem, we will see if there was any problem. I resent having to download all the information on it, and that nothing about it is available on line before you purchase it. It doesn't even come with the item it is attached to identified. I think I was stupid, but I paid alot for the product to begin with."
1,I should have read the reviews!,"I also bought this for a refurbished Dyson vacuum. It was a link on the product page, so I assumed that it was a product the company covered. This is a very misleading ploy to sell warranties and I am incredibly irritated that Amazon allows it (or that the warranty company allows it). Luckily for me, I called the warranty company and was told my vacuum is, indeed, not covered. Unfortunately, it will take more effort on my part, and 4-6 weeks to get my money back."
4,Unexpected,"I was expecting this movie to be kind of fast-paced but shallow, since most of the actors in it are known more for action films. I was pleasantly surprised to discover that Undoing is a much more sophisticated film, character-driven and emotional, with really strong acting performances and unique visual style. The plot is interesting, although not particularly new or innovative; in fact, the story is very much a throwback to classic noir films. But its enough to keep you compelled and engaged to see the story unfold. I really enjoyed this film."
1,I respectfully disagree.,"I thought this movie was slow. I understand why screenwriters make characters make stupid decisions, so that they can explore the resulting mayhem, but I thought this main character would have been smart enough not to be so dumb. This film is not one iota as good as ""Better Luck Tomorrow.""I was shocked years ago when I saw Russell Wong playing a character that had a long, classic, hair queue. In this film, Russell is a dyed blond and yes, it looks a hot mess! Clearly, they wanted him to imitate one of the villains in ""Rush Hour 1."" This film lacked subtitles of any language. I'm disappointed."
1,What an Insult!,"I can't Beleive it! these guys are acctually trying to Impersonate Oasis......... Face it guys, you can't! as a massive Oasis fan, i can only take this C.D as an insult! The music is about the best bit of the lot, but where the voice is concerned........Geez man!"
3,Not For Experienced Engineers and Scientists,"While this ""text"" a good introduction to MATLAB, the title of this book is misleading. There is an introduction to the methodology for solving engineering problems, an indication that this book is intended for an audience not yet familiar with technical problem solving. Further, there is a companion set of instruction materials available from the author. Clearly, the content, format, and style are, in fact, an introduction to MATLAB for college students. Practicing technical people should look for another book. This text is, however, an adaquate introduction for the college student, or someone unfamiliar with solving engineering problems. Not all the capabilities and features of currently available versions of MATLAB are covered. If you are using MATLAB 5.0 or later, again, consider another reference."
1,Unacceptably naiive introduction - worthless,"This book is less than worthless. It merely shows how to use matlab as a fancy calculator. It uses fancy terms in its chapters such as Weather Prediction, Flight Simulator, and what you get is a description of the random number generator !!Totally unacceptable. You have been warned."
4,Excellent Start-Up Guide,"Etter's introduction, although written for V4, provides a quick and easy startup for using MATLAB. Starting from the very basics, you'll find your view of MATLAB change from a seemingly-unfriendly application to an effective engineering tool. A must for first time users!"
5,An OUTSTANDING read,"Dee Henderson is an outstanding christian writer. I have just completed her latest book, ""The Rescuer"" and it was great."
1,Gilead's Blood,"An awful, amateurish, poorly-written book (and a shameless rip-off of Michael Moorcock's far-superior ""Corum"" books to boot). It's things like this that give books based on game systems a bad name!"
1,I got fooled,"I was trying to buy the 3 CD Box set. Instead, I got one CD with the same name as the box set."
4,Quench my desire.,"This is a three disc box set of soul singer Jackie Wilson. Jackie possessed an incredible voice and could sing just about any type of music. In fact, several of his biggest hits were based on classical or operatic melodies. But he was also great at singing in a more ""soulful"" style. Unfortunately, Jackie recorded quite a few songs that weren't very good, to be perfectly frank. This collection generally presents the ""best"" material he recorded, but there are still a few mediocre songs here. But it's still an excellent overview of his career."
4,"Wonderful, simple, and intruiging!","""Draw 50 Sharks..."" is an excellent book for children and adults interested in marine life, and at the same time wish to appreciate art. I found the step-by-step sketch examples non-intimidating as some drawing books present themselves. Children will find this book useful as a template for drawing sea creatures, and can improvise from them. The book is a ""must-read"" for children. Teachers should incorporate this book into their curriculum as a way to spark creativity in children."
3,not as good as the discontinued alternative,"The Opti-Free Express solution works ok for me but it is not as good as the Opti One which was discontinued a couple of years ago. The Opti One seemed to clean more thoroughly and left more of a ""like new"" smooth surface on the lens. I wish the manufacturer would bring back Opti One."
5,my baby's favorite,"I got this blanket at my baby shower and now my baby is 15 months. I have loved this blanket since I first touched it. It is beautiful and soft. I wish they made it in my size. ;) My daughter LOVES it too. She snuggles her face into it and falls asleep. It is all she requires at bedtime. She gets excited just seeing it. It washed very well too. It just seems to get softer and softer, if you could imagine. After 15 months of daily use and countless washings it is still beautiful. I just noticed last week that the stitching is just now starting to get a little loose. Don't bother getting something else, this will be perfect."
3,Taxi,"Wonderful to relive a portion of your youth and discover thatin reality you haven't forgotten all that much. Relive, itsworth it"
1,Don't buy it. Go with another brand!,"I have owned this stove for more than a year. It has been nothing but a head ache. It smokes up my house and has shut down for countless reasons. I take a lot of care in running the stove and cleaning it...more than the average person would care to face. Their customer service is horrible. I find it hard to believe they own the stoves themselves with how they blame each and every problem on the customer. According to them they have no ""problems"". I love the idea of burning corn for fuel but I would definatley try out a different model and different company. Anyone interested in this model should research the difficulties other people face. I am definately not the only one wouldn't you agree?"
3,"Cute, but rather ""moralistic""","My kids (ages 9 and down to toddler) seem to enjoy this series...some. As adults, my husband and I find it sort of painful and tedius to watch them with them. The plots are somewhat ""flat,"" predictable, and not very interesting...for us. As I said, my kids watch them. But they don't go back to them over and over as they do with some other shows. Not great."
5,Neat Source to have...,"I really like the 'down-to-earth' suggestions/comments. Enjoyable reading even quite humorous!Lots of Recipes/Remedies using fairly common household items which are easily accesible & inexpensive. Instead of reading several products in the aisles, make your own right at home!! Things you use regularly may benefit your plants (EX: fling that banana peel in your rose bed - they'll thrive!)Discusses many things from growing/caring for/etc Trees/Shrubs/Flowers to warding off unwanted 'pests' etc.Good book to have. I'll be pulling it off the shelf often!"
2,Illustrated?,"I was very disappointed in this book. I bought it to share with my 15 year old daughter, to help teach her the ""proper"" way to do things...Sure, those instructions are all in here, but we found ONE illustration in the entire book, despite the fact that it is advertised as an illustrated version....Very difficult to understand without visual aids...."
1,Don't be misled by the Emily Post name!,"I am very disappointed with this book. One refers to an Emily Post volume to learn what is proper, not what is commonly done. Unfortunately, this volume offers the latter."
3,"The cats should love it, but they don't","From the rattly tail to the crinkly ears, this thing should be driving my cats crazy. But they totally ignore it.Well, the big cat ignores it, and he loves the 'nip. The little one (11 lbs) saw me pull it out of the box and set it down beside him, and he slowly backed away, keeping a watchful eye on the Monster Mouse.On the plus side, my cats had fun tearing the box to shreds.3 stars for being well-constructed (and for being a good idea). I think it's just too big for my cats (who are Not Small)."
5,the Browns come alive,"Quite simply this book is an outstanding recollection of one of the most memorable teams in baseball history, the St Louis Browns. Heller takes the reader back to baseball during world war II introducing them to some of the classic players that made this lovable loser team American League Champions. It was a pleasure to read."
1,pretty Corny Song,Sampling America's song was bad enough&this by the numbers song is so boring it Hurts.I haven't dug anything By Janet in ages&this just adds to more Boredom by Her.the mixes can't add anything to this Weak Track.Her voice is Flat like Hot Cakes.
5,A must read book !,The author goes through the beginning of time through the fall to redemption with a down to earth practical view of how christian world view should like.
4,out of gas,"This book asks the question ""How long can the worldwide oil economy last""?The answer: ""Not very long"". The age of oil is fast coming to a close. What will replace it? Well, immediately reduce consumption of remaining carbon based fuels and other products or learn to reuse them. Many tons per capita in carbon based waste in landfills must be lowered NOW!Long term solutions must include moves to renewables and sustainable uses. The great ""nuclear furnace in the sky"" can provide over 50% of the earth's energy needs with today's technology without much change in North American lifestyles. To accomodate a population of 6+ billion at such levels would require 3 or 4 more planets like the earth. We ain't got 'em. So, what is one alternative to this growing probem? - get rid of a huge portion of the current population! One way or the other, the planet will fix itself and restore balance. Simple... if we don't do something soon, the planet WILL. Our choice?"
4,A tricky one,"As everyone else here says, this is a very tragic story. While the book is beautifully written, and the characters very well-drawn, the ending is upsetting and could disturb younger readers. I read it when I was too young for it - I ended up with terrible nightmares and even now I would not read it again. The ending really is a hideously violent surprise. I recommend parents read this book before giving it to their children. Due to the subject matter this book really is best suited to older children/teens, but due to Lowry being so popular with younger children (for Sam, Anastasia etc) there is a high likelihood that some children will read 'Autumn Street' before they are emotionally ready."
4,"Row Fisherman row, keep on rowing your boat","This album includes the Congo's ""Fisherman""(and Macka dub version)from the roots reggae masterpiece ""Heart of the Congos"" produced by the legendary Lee'Scratch'Perry at his fabled Black Ark Studios. Being a one Riddum concept album it feature 2006 vocal(mainly) overdubs by a who's who of reggae past and present, some of the veterans are unable to deliver performances which can surpass the brilliance of the original vocals of Cedric and Roy. Most disappointing by far is the Late and formerly great Cool Ruler, but Horace Andy,Mykal Roze and Dean Fraser offer a solid foundation. Maybe not as essential as the original, but definitely a must have for the "" hungry belly Selectas deh a shore"" ...... Check it out ....PEACE"
4,Big Youth never grows old,"My wife had a song spinning around in her head like a wash cycle. So, before it drove her crazy with curiosity, she asked me if I could identify it? I sang ""row fisherman row"" and she nodded, ""yeah yeah!! How did you know?"" Simple answer, I've been spinning this double disc for the last two days solid. ONLY tune that could be going around in her head. I could see how some fans could view this one riddim collection of ""Fisherman"" as a bit excessive. Huh, what they be smoking? Not just one disc but two! ""Fisherman Style"" reads like a who's who of greatness. I'll be looking out for ""The Tree of Satta"" next."
1,Is this a Joke?,"Has everyone lost their mind? I can't think of a single reason why this horse-faced, no-talent, Canadian angst-tart deserves a tribute album! A tribute to what? A tribute to screechy, fake ""artists"" who conspire with actual songwriters and producers to market albums to braindead, teenagers who love singing horses? Do you think horse-lipped Alanis wrote a single song on her debut? NO! Not one! Now she's got her own chessy, horse-faced tribute album? Please equine lovers, do yourselves a favor and buy a tribute album from someone with more than 10 years invested in the music industry...HA HA HA...a tribute album! You outta know..."
2,This is pretty bad,"While Alanis Morissette isn't one of the most powerful singers out there, she sure can sing when she wants to and this CD is an embarrassment to her talent. The music is decent but the singer is absolutely awful! Buy either Alanis Morissette's ""Jagged Little Pill"" or ""Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie""."
1,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!,"THIS PRODUCT SUCKS!!! plain and simple, do not buy! Ever seen those commercials where a person is kneeling on the top of their desk, in a tight, cramped-up space, with their body all contorted trying to get their phone into the service area? That was me trying to get reception on my satellite radio...I could kick myself for choosing to buy this instead of an ipod...please trust me on this, you end up wasting your money and causing yourself stress in the long run...buy the ipod"
1,Poor reception,"I was very excited to try this Stiletto unit out over the holiday break but unfortunately things didn't work out the way I wanted. As a daily commuter from the Wilmington, DE to Philadelphia, PA area I experienced very POOR reception on my entire trip. Granted I was in a train for most of this commute, but even walking around in the Delaware/Pennsylvania area in open view I still could NOT get ONE signal bar.Although my Sirius car unit does get quality reception in these areas, two thumbs down for the new Stiletto unit because of its POOR reception."
1,not what i hoped it would be,Gets really crappy reception...great for somebody who likes to only hear every other second of a song.Guess i'll get the car kit and see if i can actually use this thing.Otherwise it's going straight to e-bay.
3,Gadget,The radio is very cool - but delicate. Mine broke the first day i had it. Make sure to get a Tough skin for it or something. You will surely need at least a car jack or a behicle kit - if not both. The recording isn't very good. It's not like Tivo where it will record the whole show - but more like a VHS VCR where you have to schedule out the recording and hope that it records. It doesn't work all of the time. Depending on how you use your sirius - this could effect you as well. I am hoping that once I buy the home kit - it will solve the problem. But still - if it shuts off or somehting while recording - you lose your recording - and it misses recordings if the unit is asleep. This is a glitch - it's supposed to come on and record - but doesn't. A new Stiletto 2 is coming out - you might want tto wait and buy that one. It's cool to have - and works great in some areas. But it probably needed another year of work.
1,Don't Buy,"I read a lot of good things about this portable SIRIUS radio and ended up returning it. After reading the manual, it turns out that it gets horrible reception unless you are wearing the antenna headset that comes with it. The headset is big and bulky. Also, with the mp3 player, it is very difficult to seperate out a single track. You have to load the entire CD."
3,pretty good but not great,"As with all the sirius products I have purchased, the satellite signal strength leaves much to be desired. Wi-fi signal is very good but you lose channels and the ability to record. 100 hours of recording time is awesome, I can record Howard replays in the evening and listen at work the next day. Would be nice to listen live, but no signal strength indoors. 800 Megs of MP3 space is OK, but compared to many MP3 players that give 30 GB it's pretty pointless. The cost is reasonable now, but add 100.00 for car and home kits."
3,Stiletto is a bit disappointing,The Stiletto 100 looks good and has every possible means of connecting to all kinds of media. The problem is connecting to a signal. Wi-Fi connections are marginal and satellite reception is almost impossible. Fix connectivity to a signal and you'll have a great product.
4,Good Product-needs high signal strength,It is a good product. Easy to navigate through and operate. But the signal strength is somewhat lacking and really only works well when the device is stable and not moving with the top pointed up.
2,almost useless,first of all the reception is bad unless you have the antenna/headset on which causes dammage to the ear canal.you could hold the radio over your head when you jog and use your ear buds not the ones that came with it they are very cheap.i think the radio would work better in major metropolitan cities where you have terrestrial antenna that bounce the signal.i thought well ill use it my car and buy the car kit. the built in fm modulater is so week that it came with a fm antenna which is like the one that comes with your house receiver.it really didnt help still interferece from the stop lights at the intersections and a lot of buzzing from the lack of signal.this is my third radio in about five years and i wish i would of went with something a little less expensive.the mp3 works good though
2,No Reception,"This product is great except for the fact it does not receive a signal inside your house which keeps you from ever listening to it while inside. Also, it is not compatible with an outside antenna or a ""repeater"" system sold by Sirius. It is portable but has weak reception!"

1,Horse-loving Reader,"I would not recommend this book to anyone. For all the author's obvious knowledge about horses, I question her motives in writing a book where every horse suffers terribly. I found very little to like about the heroine (Nate) and, once she passively allowed Twister to die, I could never forgive her. Then, to top it off, she abandons the other horses in her care to an obviously-disturbed person. I blame her for their deaths too. This book is extremely depressing. I could find no hope in it, not even at the end."
2,Hopeless in New Jersey,"Great literary potential but left us without hope, unless that was Dimmick's intent. I was angry that Nate was so impotent in her communiccation with Pierce and others. She could have been an advocate for Twister and the other horses but instead contributes to the death spiral. She could have made a difference in both human and equine lives and let her loss produce a positive. Show us the healing that takes place when you connect with a horse! There was no indication that anything would change with Nate; death and evasion would continue to hang over her. Even the little black foal's outlook was bleak. I have no desire to drag through a depressing sequel."
1,In the Presence of Horses,"I DID NOT like this book. It kept shifting tenses, and oddly enough, the present tense indicated the past. It had very little to do with horses. The girl in the story is totally irresponsible, leaving a job with no advance warning. The end is TERRIBLE. Perhaps she is trying to leave it open for a sequel, but it was depressing and very poorly done!!!! This girl had more to work out than horses could help her with. I took it as soon as I had finished it to a used bookstore. It sure isn't my kind of book!!!!"
1,Boring,"This DVD just shows growned up guys playing around with more complicated toys, attempting to built a trebuchet. It would be the same to see a two-year-old child trying to built a castle of cards."
1,One Pot Meals for People with Diabetes,"One Pot Meals for People with DiabetesSince my doctor has cautioned me against carbs, there was very few recipes I could use from this cookbook."
3,Carbs are not restricted low enough.,"The recipes look very interesting and tasty, however the carb levels are higher than some diabetic diets require. Since it is put out by the ADA I guess that I should have known that in advance."
2,Not The Usual Warhammer 40K Story...,"...of violent battles. I found this book to be a real trial to finish and glad when it finally ended! Unlike the previous reviwer, I can't bear to read this again. If you're looking for more of the Warhammer 40K genre, this isn't for you, but if you simply want to know more about the Warhammer 40K universe (and a limited view at that), then you may consider this one."
1,The worst book I've ever read all the way through.,"This book is truly terrible. Some of the worst text-on-paper I've ever read, the characters were ridiculous, the plot was absurd, the only redeeming feature was the description of the kid's mutation, but that's maybe two pages worth out of the whole thing. So less than 1% of this book is worth reading.Then it had the gall to have such a cliche ending as it did. After the crap sundae that was this book, that was the corn niblet on top to solidify it as the worst thing I've ever read, not one single redeeming feature to it.Although granted, I haven't read anything by C.S. ""Multilaser"" Goto yet, I hear he's really bad too."
3,not what I thought it would be,It would have been the perfect dress but the wrong color. They sent me green when I ask for white and the material was to thin for what I needed it for. It will be alright for a costume but not for an lil girl usher dress.
5,A bookshelf reference book keeper,"I hadn't come across this book until this past year, and I wish I had it earlier. It sits on my shelf where it will be helpful now and in the future. Thank you, Cornish, et al."
2,This book was hard to follow.,Limerick jumps from decade to decade in this book. I would not suggest this book to anyone. I had to just make myself finish it it was horrible.
2,Nothing new,"Although Limerick writes in a beautiful narrative and shows a few good ideas (the thought that the West existed before Euro-Americans ""discovered"" it), she came up with nothing new. Her book glosses over much of western history and lacks information in many specific and important areas of interest. Pass on this one if you are looking for historical depth."
2,This thing sucks.,"While I'm driving, this thing doesn't work at all. There's tons of static and the music cuts out all the time. The only time this FM transmitter works is when my car is still. Maybe it's because my antenna is on the back of my rear window and the transmitter can't reach it. Overall, I'd say this product is garbage."
3,OK while it lasted,Worked like it was supposed to as long as it was on a totally unused station. But it quit working after about a year.
4,Decent Product,"Probably the best FM Transmitter on the market, but these things by nature are pretty limited from a sound quality standpoint. If getting your iPod or MP3 player to play through your car stereo is a real priority for you and there is a hardwired solution for your car, by all means use the money you would have spent on the FM Transmitter to use on that solution. You'll be much happier."
3,Kensington FM Transmitter,"I purchased this item from Amazon and am using it with a Sony NWZZ818BLK MP3 player to work with a factory AM/FM stereo in my new F-250.I am experiencing distortion and hiss at the high end with my MP3 volume set at approximately 70% as directed by the instructions. Once I reduce my MP3 volume to around 30%, the audio sounds fine, but I then have to crank the vehicle radio to its limit. I have another vehicle that I connect my MP3 to via a cassette adapter, and it sounds just fine. So I believe the distortion is a result of the FM transmitter. I will hold onto this transmitter though because it will cost too much to have an aftermarket stereo installed."
4,Excellent Resource for Calibration,"I'm not your average consumer. I'm not a professional, either. I know more about calibrating than your average person. I'm an enthusiest - a ""pro-sumer"" if you will. I found that this blu-ray can be as simple or complex as you want - you get to decide. I can use it and my 70 year old parents can use it - each of us using different levels of ease in calibration. I think that's an outstanding achievement. Have fun tweaking..."
4,Works Extremely well!,"This is a great calibration set. Works really well and helps to tune in your picture and sound. Could stand to have walk through instructions while doing the calibration. Very simple to use overall, and well worth the picture you will get from the use!"
3,OK Product,"I recently picked this up with my reward points. It was okay at best. I'm afraid I would have been a little disappointed had I spent actual cash on it. The presentation was neat, classic Disney, and it was easy to use. However, I did not think the results were that spectacular....maybe I messed up somewhere! I think a more acceptable price would have been in the ten to fifteen dollar range for this product."
3,HDTV Optimizer just OK,"I bought this product even before I got our new Samsung 3D HDTV because I wanted the very best out of our new set. The optimizing tools are easy to understand but nothing I didn't have just looking through my Samsung manual. The best part of the two disk set is the bonus DVD; very vivid colors and scenery. The write-up makes the optimizing DVD sound like some fun Disney disk where Goofy walks you through all the settings, but in reality Goofy is only in one small section and the rest is down to business. If you want to buy it to optimize your TV, I wouldn't recommend it; but if you want the bonus DVD as another Disney oceanographic movie, then it's a go."
2,Waste of 20 bucks!,"I dont know the designer of the this program but he should go back to school! Totally useless and frustrating goin back and forth.Not enough adjustability, finally I liked my eye and settings and the actual reset settings on the tv.Buy a movie instead."
4,Great product for the do it yourself type,"I've used this a number of times. I'm pretty savy when it comes to technical stuff, but I still stumbled a bit with this. I'm not saying that it is the disk's fault, because I'm sure it is not. But in the end, I just ended up using calibration settings that I found online. While this does do brightness and contrast, when it comes to calibrating color, you need a lot more than this tool."
4,Cute story!,"I got this movie because I am distantly related to Butch Cassidy, and I thought it would be fun to have. It is a cute story and my family enjoyed it!"
2,"Good,sorta","This film is low budget!It has a good plot though!But it was not one of my favorites!Good family film,just not my type of movie!I love westerns,but not western attempts!"
4,Good little charger,This should best be placed on a table outside. It supports the often used battery sizes;which has been quite convenient.
3,"Well, it works","What can I say? It recharged my 4 C Energizers in winter-level sunlight in one afternoon.It does require you to recharge 4 batteries at once, can't handle 9V batteries, and if your cell phone power plug isn't one of the 4 types it attaches to, you're SOL. Other than that, it appears to do what it claims."
2,A Toy,"This is a toy that only charged my batteries to 25%. If you want a toy charger it's fine. If you want a real charger, put this money with some more and get a real charger. This is more of a novelty item."
3,No longer comes with 6 Keys,"We are in investment property, so we order these keys often. The last order's packaging looked different and certainly did not have ""Security"" on the packaging. It also had only 4 keys, so I called Kwikset itself to make sure that I was not sent the wrong product. Kwikset told me first, they change packaging often and to tell for sure if it correct is the code above the barcode (if it was not changed that is) will have the correct code as above.Second, Kwikset told me they are no longer providing 6 keys with these sets. So unless you get one of the earlier packaging still out there, there is a 90% chance you will receive only 4 keys, unlike what the description above states.Otherwise, these keys work well."
4,DDE Pleasantly Surprising,"I must say I really didn't know what I was getting into when I got this book. I was actually looking at some sales online and was getting some anime DVDs when I saw this title also listed. I picked it on a whim because it looked like it would be a laugh, and it was cheap so if I didn't like it, I wouldn't be losing out.Little did I know that not only was it funny, it was sweet and I became completely absorbed into the story. It's so engaging that I can't wait to read the rest of the books. I like the old art, but especially the different ways Takeru is portrayed (and it doesn't hurt that he's modeled after one of my fav Japanese singers Hyde!).If you're into love, friendships and a story that's more than you would expect, I definitely recommend this."
2,Just get the book,"The book looks ok, although I haven't really gotten a chance to use the techniques. However, the clicker that came with my kit doesn't make any sound whatsoever. Apparently other people didn't get broken ones, but I did. It's not worth shipping back, so I'm just going to buy a new clicker that actually works.Meanwhile, my cats hate the shriveled up little treats that came in the kit. They sniff them, lick them, and then ultimately leave them partially re-hydrated on my floor. So I'm going to have to figure out something else to use for treats. Really wish I'd just gotten the book and skipped the kit."
4,You heard it first from my TWO-LIPS...Excellent book!,"I don't know, maybe it is my penchant for all things French or maybe it is my prankster personality but I found this to be one of the most charming children's books around. The drawings are absolutely beautiful and the story is sweet. The back of the book says, ""Don't you just love surprises?"" Well, I grabbed this book for my children on impulse and was very pleasantly surprised!"
3,Sucking Up 101,"This book was very disappointing. David Weiner devotes most of his book, ""Power Freaks: Dealing with them in the workplace or anyplace"" to defining the power freak rather than dealing with the power freak. In addition to his lengthy descriptions of each type of power freak, Weiner's book is filled with pointless second hand stories and a large number of quotes from other books on the same subject. Could it be Mr. Weiner didn't have enough of an opinion of his own to fill up an entire book? When he finaly does get down to the nuts and bolts of how to deal with power freaks, his advice is basicaly suck up or shut up.I'm glad I checked this book out from the library and didn't spend any money on it. I hope you'll do the same."
3,I needed a camera flash to wake me up,"A friend recommended Geoff Dyer to me and when I saw the synopsis for this book, I figured I would start with this one. I like photography but I don't know much about it so I thought this would be great. Unfortunately I was disappointed. I really wanted to like this book and I think it's an awesome concept, but after the first eighty pages or so, I found myself skimming faster and faster. I rarely don't finish a book because I'm one of those bookies, but this one was an exception. Maybe I'll make my way back to this (and for that reason I'm giving it 3 stars instead of 2), but for now it's in the corner of my bookshelf serving a long time-out on account of second degree boredom."
5,superb look at photography,"This book is not a history of photography--nor is it meant to be--though it does look at photography over a large span of time and so is by default a history of sorts. But the book is really one writer's meditation on photography. As such, much is left out, but the omissions in no way mar the book; being comprehensive is not the point. One reviewer above calls the book cynical, like cocktail chatter (not sure what the two have in common or how Dyer could in any way be construed as cynical), which seems preposterous. Simply put, Dyer writes as a person fascinated with and under the spell of photography (an approach he took to his book on jazz), and in doing so offers keen insights--the likes of which are not to be found in other books on the subject. His viewpoint as an outsider is actually a benefit. Beautifully written, this book is a classic, something a reader will return to again and again."
2,readable,"I'm a little puzzled by the enthusiasm about this book. It's even won a photographic writing award. If you don't know much about American photography you may find it interesting, it is well written and easy to read. If you are already well informed about the work of classic American photographers like Walker Evans, Stieglitz, etc then this won't strike you as an especially interesting book. It's a very loose set of comments about recurring themes in American photography. It's one long unstructured essay but without the insights or wisdom of essayists like Susan Sontag."
5,Really works,"This probiotic really beats the candida. The foggy-head feeling was gone within days! The clarity of mind was back!! I really didn't think about it much, but continued taking the product. Then I ran out. Never thought about it again until I got a bad stomach virus. Diarrhea, vomiting, and sick for three days. It took almost a week to recover. The lack of mental clarity and foggy-head ""feeling like I'd been drinking"" came right back. It took a month to remember Threelac. I ordered something else, it has not worked. I'm ordering Threelac TODAY! Just be careful of the expiration date. One order I recieved was out of date, but Amazon refunded my money."
2,There are better products out there,"I had spent so long researching probiotics. I have massive gut issues and suffered from debilitating intestinal issues for 3 1/2 years straight. After cutting out gluten, that seemed to help (even though my celiac test came back normal). Also, Standard Process has great ProBiotics called ProSynbiotic. These probiotics worked better for me then all of the other pribiotics combined. I would just invest in those if you are in need of true gut repair."
3,Disappointing,"I bought this product based on posted testimonials as i have many of the shared symptoms. Unfortunately, it did not relieve my persistent sore throat, nor my sinus headaches. Can't say whether or not it helped my IBS. Disappointed."
3,Indifferent,"I ordered two boxes of Threelac (60 pack) plus GHT Oxygen Elements (1 oz.). I took 1 packet/day for 1 week and then 2 packets/day until completion.I noticed no discernible difference in my health, although I have to admit that I have more issues I'm dealing with than just a high yeast count. Personally, I did not experience any issues with stomach cramps etc, as others have suggested and I would not consider my stomach to be among the stronger ones (perhaps beginning slowly with 1 pack the first week helped).Overall I cannot recommend nor discount the possible benefits of the product. Sorry I can't be more helpful."
2,Didn't work for me,"I tried three lac for about one month during which time I gradually increased from 1 to 3 packets/day. Didn't notice any improvements in my health. Although I did find the three-lac to give me an incredible amount of gas at times. Taking another good quality probiotic along with the three lac seemed to reduce the gas problem though.In short, I find the 4 or 5 star reviews hard to believe. Seems like a lot of hype...but perhaps it does work for some people, but just didn't work for me. Right now I'm trying the ""wholeapproach"" anti-candida plan and am getting much better results (after just a week or so). I now think that some kind of colon cleansing is essential to resolving severe candida problems."
5,Great for Eczema,"My 2 year old has battled ear infections, eczema and bouts of the Rota virus for a year. I started him on Threelac as a last resort - hoping for any little bit of change. I have to tell you, I will not let him go without this product now. His eczema has completely gone away, his ear battle is under control (though I do a lot of other things as well to help with that issue) and his last run-in with the rota virus disappeared within 24 hours of using Threelac. I love it!!!"
3,Threelac works,"Threelac works and Fivelac works slightly better. However, I think Fivelac was a little too strong for me in picking up the same dosage (2-4 packets a day) so I have discontinued it for its slightly less expensive version."
3,Nasty,I could not complete the regime. This supplement has an odd texture that I could not get past. I might try it again in the future.
1,"Really, I dont know!","I was not even going to write a review because as the title stands, I really do not know how it is. So basically I am going to give it ONE star for now since thats how I feel right now. I will keep updating as we go.I have been on the threelac for the last 3 weeks. I am using for vaginal yeast issues for the past 10 months straight! I started with one packet a day for a week. Then 2 packets a day for a week and now three packets a day for the 3rd week. I see absolutly NO results. I still want to die! I am so uncomfortable. I am torn between is this yeast die off or not working? Noone can really answer. So thats my review so far! Maybe it is die off and I am getting better but none of the other symptoms are better like the depression and headaches and tiredness. Actually out of 100% I am now 75% tired so 25% less tired. If you have any questions please ask, I will try to answer."
2,"Overpriced, Overhyped MLM Product","This product has been sold through Multi-Level Marketing for years now. I bought into the hype and bought a ""3 month supply"" for $150. I read so many rave reviews on it, that I was 100% positive it would work. Well, needeless to say, it didn't. While I didn't notice NO effects, the results were pretty darn close to zero.Don't believe the hype that this is a candida silver bullet. It works for some, and it doesn't work for some, just like most nutritional supplements. One of the things that isn't emphasized enough unfortunately is eating right for your type. Avurveda says it, Chinese Medicine says it.I'm not here to call the testimonials on this product fake, but I bet you're going in reality see a 50/50 split down the middle with those it's worked for and those it hasn't."
1,Big Hype!!!!!!,"I used this product for a few months and at first I was feeling really good, but after the month wore off I had to take more and more and it seemed like a constant expensive circleI did take the advice of one of your reviewers and went to the health food store and bought a good probiotic and that made a world of difference and I did save a lot of money and got much better results"
1,Didn't do anything for me,"I got my Threelac a month ago to deal with upset stomach issues and occasional acne breakout. Initially I was taking 2+ per day (first 2 weeks) then backed it down to once per day (last 2 weeks) and saw no significant difference in general health. If I ate unhealthy, my stomach still hurt the next day, if I ate a healthy meal I felt fine. I had 2 breakouts while taking this stuff too, so didn't seem to have an affect there. Maybe I didn't take it regularly for long enough, but Threelac didn't seem to affect me at all, and therefore was a waste of $30. Me thinks this is snake oil, but all the best to those that feel better about themselves while using it."
3,So far so good,"After a month of using this, I would say that it has helped somewhat. Not quite the miracle that some people have experienced. Having said that, it may take some additional time... To avoid die-off side effects, I suggest checking out [...]. Some very good suggestions there."
5,works for me,"I have dealt with eczema for at least 10+ years. This product actually works. I have been taking 1 packet everyday for at least 30 days now, and my eczema has been greatly reduced. I have used prescription cremes, other probiotics, over the counter cremes, etc with limited success. Taking that into account, I would say that this product has given me the greatest success which is why I give it 5 stars."
2,not so happy,"This product would be great if it didn't have Canola Oil in it. The item description does not include this information, so buyer beware. If you're fighting Candida, Canola Oil is a GMO and not recommended. If you question why I'm saying this, please look up Canola Oil and get informed.Threelac Probiotic Dietary Supplement, Natural Lemon Flavor, Includes 60 .053-Ounce Packets"
1,Horrible design,"My wife and I have two cats. We originally had a Littermaid Ultra automatic litterbox that seemed to work for us. It kept the litter fairly clean and was relatively trouble free. The motor gave out on it about three months ago after about four years of daily service. I purchased the Petmate thinking that it would be a superior product. I was mistaken. The rake continually jammed, the soiled litter liners were much more complicated to change, the tines on the litter rake were spaced to widely apart to really clean the litter and the item simply did not work. What ever you do, do not buy this product! I would give it negative stars if I could. It is now in the trash can and has been replaced with a conventional litterbox."
2,"Horrible Box, Great Warranty!","Okay, so as everyone else said this thing is junk! I bought it because I am pregnant and wanted something easy to use and not as dirty. Well, this was a mistake! I had to constantly use a regular litter scooper to get chunks out that the rake wouldn't get, and if I didn't change the litter almost every other day, nasty stuff would get caught behind the rake causing it to lock up. It finally locked up to where it wouldn't work anymore...keep in mind this was all within the first month of purchase, so I called the company, they have you send in a request with the serial number and a piece of the belt and they said they would send me a new one. Instad of sending me a new one, they sent me a refund because they were ""out of stock"" well, every other online site that sells them right now is out of stock too...I wonder if its because they dont work and the company isn't making anymore...who knows...DONT BUY IT!! ITS NOT WORTH THE MONEY!!"
2,nashville homecoming,"this would probably be good if you love Christian music. I was hoping for more bluegrass or country and western acts/performances rather than the stable of singers present. The Christian message is fine, except for people like Doyle Lawson the acts are routine."
5,great gift,i got this for my father for xmas. he really enjoyed it. this was a great buy and it was awesome to read something by davy crockett himself!
4,Fun but not so sturdy,"My daughter (just turned 4) and my son (1 1/2) have enjoyed playing with this toy. It has some really cute features. I like the way the moat moves when the music plays, and there's a really clever dance floor that spins around so the weebles can ""dance"" to the music. My kids love putting the characters in the back of the horse and galloping around. The weebles can slide all the way from the top of the castle, through the trap door, and down to the moat. I also appreciate that this toy is mostly large enough for both kids to play at the same time.What I don't like is the construction of the castle. The front and back staircases don't stay snapped into place. They come off and end up scattered across the living room floor with the castle furniture. I may try some super glue to see if that helps...Overall, though, this toy is quite a hit with my kids, and popular with their friends when we have play dates too."
3,Just okay.. Could be better,My 2 year old son LOVES this toy. The tree house is a better toy. The music & moat stopped working imediately. He liked to put everything in the moat & it just got jammed & broke completely. he still loves playing with the castle. Making everything go down the slide including his golf balls. Very entertaining for him.
1,no real customer support available,Sept 22 2006Ordered this product from Amazon and received it a week ago. Tried printing some floorplans and the background printed as small light gray dots. The background color is set as white. Tried to get help from Encore but there's no way to talk to a person. All they have is this online forum that you can post a question on. Posted the question on 9-16-06 and have not received any answer as of today.If I could get my money back for this software I would.Dan Keith
3,X-acto Knife,"Decent inexpensive Knife. Its a good knife if you are just starting out on modeling but you will eventually need a better one. This is just a super basic no frils craft knife. the only complaint I have really, is the screw on head that holds the blade, comes lose pretty off and that can be a pain if you are doing some delicate, tedious work with it. Three stars for being inexpensive and of decent quality, minus two for not holding on to its blade."
5,Great cookbook for hunters!,"I gave this cookbook as a gift to the wife of a hunter. Great present for her. Great present for the hunter! Wonderful recipes for pheasant and quail, which are not the common recipes to find in other cookbooks. Nice photos, too."
2,Not NRs usual standard,"Unfortunately I didn't find this book up to the usual standard of J D Robb novels, the fight was overplayed, and the other characters weren't given enough time. I can't put my finger on it, but reading this book seemed more like a chore.Vicki"
3,Loyal But Disappointed,"I eagerly awaited this next installment in the Eve Dallas/Roarke series and after reading it was not disappointed.As usual, there were a lot of futuristic references, the case that Eve was working on-along with her gang at the NYPSD-was compelling as usual and I especially enjoyed the different twist in the usually sizzling relationship between Eve and Roarke. I will continue to look forward to the books in this series. As far as my disappointment goes, all I can say is ""Nora, Nora, Nora...was it really necessary to all of a sudden print this in hardback when up till now these books have always been in paperback-why the sudden ""($$$)upgrade?($$$)"" Thanks to amazon.com for letting us all have the option of buying for a little less, ie: ""used"" but still being able to enjoy it just the same."
3,Get a life,"Come on, I think it is way over due for Paul Di'Anno to get a life and quit riding on the coat tails of Iron Maiden. Yes, the first few Maiden albums were great, yes he was great, but is that all he is going to do year after year like he has for the past twenty five plus years. Seems everything he has done since has had some visual or titled connection with Maiden. He hasn't really done anything very original since. Come on, give us a break. Do your own thing. Try not to put a CD or video out that has anything to do with Maiden...be original for once. Jeez."
3,A must-have resource for cursory costume research,"As a costume designer, I use this book to refresh my memory on silhouette and style for specific eras. Although the garments are rendered on the same body style (blocky and androgenous) and Peacock deliberately ignores examples of non-European influence, I turn to this book regularly to see the fashions in the context of a chronological timeline, e.g. bustles after crinolines, hose before breeches. Its color and visual emphasis redeem its Anglo-centric attitude."
4,very amusing,"Great episodes! Season 5 is a whole lot better than Season 4! I like Friend Or Foe, New Digs,Krabs a la Mode and The Krusty Sponge! If you like spongebob BUY THIS! The only episode that is kind of bad is Fungus Among Us! Great DVD!"
4,Propeller Puller Kit,"The Kit comes in a handy case and contains most everything one would need to service inboard-drive boat propellers. The puller is heavy duty and could handle large props. It's a bit pricey, but there aren't many sources for them. It was delivered via FedX in a couple of days."
1,"nice system, but loves to use batteries","We bought this toy for a x-mas present. Put batteries in it on 12/25/06 and on 12/27/06 the batteries would not power the air part, but the light would work. Replaced the batteries on 12/27/06 and it works fine again, but by noon on 12/28/06 the batteries were dead again. Playskool should of made this with a plug. I have two kids age 4 and 7 who love to play this game. I also like it but the battery thing is an issue. If you buy this make sure you have rechargeable batteries."
2,Book is not designed for mystery shoppers,I purchased this book with the idea that the focus was on surprising secrets for the mystery shopper assignee. It is the other way around.This is a great book for retailers and not for the mystery shopper.
2,Not like the picture,"Hardwood pickaxes are getting harder to find these days, but they feel so much better. Not a single store here sells them, so I went hunting for one online and picked this one to only find that it has fiberglass wrapped around the tip with the steel pick placed over that. This is exactly what I wanted to avoid because every time I use one with this kind of material, the pick comes off. They don't last six months with me. The ground here is rock, not soil. The image the seller has put here on Amazon is not what I got in the mail. I am still willing to give this thing a try since I need one, but I'll update if it breaks."
5,I'm satisfied.,"I wanted a MP-3 player with FM radio, recording capabilities, and enough storage space. I found this with the Creative Zen Micro Photo 4GB MP-3 player. I'm happy with my purchase."
5,Excellent! Excellent!,"I ordered this for my son for Christmas. It was beautiful!!! No Hassle shopping, new and no malls"
1,POS ZEN Micro Creative support now sucks,"Caution. Creative used to have great support. Now, 60 days of phone support. I have a 9 month old ZEN Micro. It will not start, if I plug it in, it appears to charge but never completes, If I turn it on while plugged in i get to the Creative boot up screen, it goes blank and never completes the boot up. Useless junk now. I cnnot find my original receipt, (who can). I cannot be returned, and I cannot get support on it.I will be returning my perfectly good running Vision M with receipt, as i cannot risk this device breaking down too.I have always hated Apple, I am a PC guy, but an Ipod will be my next MP3 device."
3,Hard for Beginner to Use,"Trying to figure out how to S-L-O-W-L-Y and S-P-E-C-I-F-C-A-L-L-Y hit the button in the middle and then the arrow has been a very frustrating process on this product.The sound is great, downloads are easy, but the user-friendly part ends there."
2,Bland as bread,"I love to read P&P sequels. Everyone likes to imagine what would have happened to Darcy and Elizabeth. None will ever stand up to the original of course, but I have read many sequels that I've enjoyed. This treatment of P&P however is the most boring I have come across. The characters are not fleshed out at all and the story is boring and simplistic. Usually I can find something good about a book, not this time. I feel that I have wasted my money. I will avoid purchasing any of Ms Birchall's books in the future."
1,Not a good sequel!,This is the worst of the pride and prejudice sequels. The plot is disturbing. Having both the Darcy and Bingley heir use their cousin Miss Wickham as their mistress. The book really grossed me out! If you wish to avoid an explicit and soap opera book just say no!
2,Where was the editor?,"The plot is mildly entertaining, but the writing style feels strained, and punctuation errors are frequent enough to be distracting."
4,"Very nice read, one of better/best published P&P sequels","I enjoyed this book a lot. I found the characterizations good and the dialogue lively. It is a fun read!It is also a ""read it once"" sort of a book. I agree with the reviewer who said: ""I found no highs or lows worth being in a dilemma over. People got hurt, people got married, folks visited and it was all presented rather matter-of-factly.""The plot was interesting enough to read once, but no more. This is why I rated it 4 stars and not 5 stars. If possible, I would borrow this book from a library or a friend rather than buy it, because I would not read it over and over.I am working my way through all of the published P&P; sequels and reviewing them. I am not finished with this project yet, but this author is in the ""top three"" of all the published P&P; sequel writers. Also, this book is rated ""G"" and is appropriate for a younger audience (unlike my favorite P&P; sequel author, Abigail Reynolds)."
1,Neck Saver,This item is to large for the Alto Saxophone. Product was fine but it did not work. Not recommend for the alto saxophone.
5,Keeps neck dry,This neck saver is great. Very plush and swabs out all the saliva build up in a single pass. Great bargain.
2,poor recording quality,"This is a low fidelity live recording of a 1970 performance. Must have been flu season - audience members cough throughout. Very poor audio recording, as if a mic was placed just above and behind the orchestra. Performance is fine, but the sound quality is too distractive to justify owning this recording. AM radio sound is best description."
1,Not Even Worth Trying,"You may think that this is a top notch shampoo, but it is not. My doctor gave this to me when he realized how bad my dandruff or seborrhea dermatitis was. I expected the condition to get better, but it had just gotten worse! I switched to Selsun Blue and I had amazing results with the micro-bead scrub! So one day I decided to go back to this shampoo because I wanted my dandruff to be completely gone. I should not have done that. The result was me scratching my head all day. When I got home I immediately washed it. And now, my scalp is red, smells terrible, hurts, and is extremely greasy, almost as if it was bleeding. This shampoo has never given me good results. I have to go back to the doctor. That is how severe it is; stick with Selsun Blue, you'll thank me later. I hope you enjoyed this review!"
3,It was okay,"It held my attention for the most part but I fond it to be slow and very dry in a lot of areas. I found the story entertaining but it seemed to be one of those books that I could put down for a couple day and pick it back up later and it wouldn't make a difference. It wasn't slated as a must read to me... BUT at the same time it wasn't bad enough to never want to read Dierdre Savoy again... If anything, I'm intrigued by her style and want to know if she's evolved since this book... I'm actually about to order whatever her most recent book is and see how I'm digging it.All in all I would say buy it on discount or borrow it. I woulnd't pay full price for this."
2,Homebaking Experience,"This video is a personal homebaking experience, if you are a cake baker itself you might just get a preview of what you already know or a few tips like the strip but it's not easy to find in asean country like us. And if you're looking for more method baking and decorating technique try Baking School's own videos like Wilton."
2,I'm a comic book fan and this game is boring.,"I might have ruined my own enjoyment of this game by using cheat codes. However, regardless this item seems to fool you into thinking that the psp version is just like the ps2 version. This is not the case. It's a linear smash-em-up and you don't do a lot of smashing. The camera sucks and the bosses are just drab. I feel like this game should have belonged on the ps1 instead. It gives the psp a bad rep when people play sucky games like this on it."
4,tournament chess,"i got this game for my son for christmas.he really likes chess but doesn't have any one to play with, at least not on his level. he seems to really enjoy the video game."
2,Didn't finish it.,"I think it read on the cover that it was compared to The Stand and Swan Song...um....not really. I've read dozens and dozens (and dozens) of apocalyptic novels, and was hoping for a good one. I never found the story even moderately engaging and I don't think I even finished it... maybe someday I'll read it again, when books are no longer being printed and I have read everything else in my library ten times......"
4,Not a classic Scooby Doo and could be too scary for younger kids.,"My daughter really likes this particular show. However, this is not a fully classic Scooby Doo episode, but there is a mystery. They solve it. However, there is a supernatural ending and it is not a mystery. There is a real witch ghost and they narrowly escape world destruction. Also, Freddy remarks ""We aren't kids,"" which seems very odd for a Scooby episode. I personally don't appreciate breaking from the classic, but my five year old daughter enjoys the show. I think the animation is good, the music is better than most, and there are some funny scenes. Therefore, I can give it four stars, but that is rounding up from 3.5 stars."
1,"What Tim Burton did to Batman, this video does to Scooby Doo","I wanted to be able to tell you that the review from ""Lisa"" was just the opinion of some uptight, ultra-religious person. Then I bought the video for my almost-four-year-old, who LOVES Scooby. It's WAY too spooky for him and just really has some odd stuff for a kid's video. As one reviewer commented, one CAN see these Gothic types of things in any American HIGH school (I know--I teach in one), but one does not expect to see discussions of Wiccans and the Salem Witch Trials in a ""Fun for the Whole Family"" video. There is some really warped stuff in this film. Teenagers may like it, but my son was not a happy camper. I advise parents of ""young'uns"" to stay away from this video no matter how tempted you are to think Lisa and I are just some religious zealots. There's no fun, light-hearted song in the background during the chase scene here; they are running for their lives!"
3,THE WITCH IS REAL,"This 70 min video features the crew with only minor changes to the outfits of Freddy and Daphne. The voices are exactly like the old familiar series. Velma gets lots of time. The video features tunes by ""Billy Ray Cyrus"" and ""HEX"". UNFORTUNATELY THE FAMILIAR GENRE OF HAVING A BAD GUY UNMASKED IS MISSING. THE EVIL WITCH IS REAL. This video is set at Halloween BUT Goes Far Beyond, and may not be appropriate for those who have non-occult values and/or children who are impressionable."
3,Slight But Entertaining,"McMurtry scholars have dubbed this part of the author's ""Trash Trilogy,"" and if you're expecting Lonesome Dove or Terms of Endearment you may agree. This is McMurtry's sidelong, amused and also slightly amazed look at the foibles of Washington, D.C. There's not a lot going on here, but McMurtry spins a good yarn nonetheless. You won't be uplifted or probably even very impressed, but you will be entertained."
2,Slightly Entertaining but Empty,"This book offers a glimpse into the tawdry life of Cadillac Jack, a narcissistic antiques dealer whose whole ambition seems to be peddling junk and meeting women. Although Jack seems to find fulfillment at the end of the book, I felt upon finishing it that I was asking myself, ""So What???"""
3,It's alright.,"Having just endured the thrill of Hurricane Sandy and knowing of the huge power outages in parts of our country, I considered what I would do for long term power outage lite supply. So, I decided to buy this lamp as kerosene stores well and I already have a kerosene heater. The lamp is inexpensive, and it shows. The metal is very thin and the glass is not tempered very thick, although it seems to be accepting the heat well. It is cheap to burn this fuel and it doesn't really smell too much if the wick is low enough. The light emitted is certainly ample for evening activities, although I might have to strain a bit for long reading sessions. This lamp will do for now, but since I love the ambiance of this lite, I will probably buy a more expensive, durable one in the future. But, for the price, this is certainly a good value."
1,"This thing is a safety hazard...I wish it worked, but the flame/wick were not controllable, at least in my hands.","This thing is a safety hazard...I wish it worked, but the flame/wick were not controllable, at least in my hands. I would recommend this product to no one."
1,cheap cheap cheap,lasted one usage.leaked oil all over.DO NOT BUY!!keep looking you will not want this item.a big waste of money.the glass shattered after about 5 minutes use a danger.
1,50- 75% off buying at walmart,"I did not purchase this lantern here, but found it at walmart for 50-75% less than the price listed here. Just FYI for those wanting one, buy there and save money."
2,I can feel my muscles twitching!,"I really like most Kiss My Face products that I've tried, but this one did nothing for me except dry out my skin. It dried it out to the point that I was having facial spasms while it was on, which was kind of neat. Maybe this is better for people who have oily skin. For me, it didn't make any noticeable difference in my pores. There are better masks out there."
1,Does not represent Christian women,"This book by Groothuis is not representative of who I am as a Christian woman, and it would be a mistake for any non-Christian woman to believe this attitude is embraced by most women in Christianity. It is not. If a woman is looking for reasons to not have a servant's heart, read the Groothuis book. (We are commanded as followers of Christ to be servants in Christianity). This book hurts God. It does not inspire any woman to serve children with her time and nurturing nature or her husband, for that matter, but it is egocentric and vain in message and attitude. How can the author be filled with the Holy Spirit and yet be so filled with herself? This is not any book I could ever recommend as a Christian. For a more accurate history of feminism and its effects on both the pagan culture and Christianity I would like to recommend The Feminist Mistake by Mary Kassian (Crossway)."
3,eh.. so so,"I suggest reading this book with as open a mind as possible, or else you'll find yourself completely lost in the alternate reality of three-armed characters, clones, and orbs that float in front of heads and narrate stories. Despite not being too fond of the book, I did find it an oddly grasping novel and a quick read. The underlying tones of globalization can easily be lost to most readers."
5,A great book about a great driver,"Mark Martin has always been a class act in NASCAR, and this book lives up to Martin's reputation. The photos are a great collection, and the text is interesting and has a depth not usually found in a driver bio.For the Mark Martin fan who wants an in-depth look at the man, or for the general NASCAR fan who wants a great archive of photos, a this is a must-have book."
5,Great Gift for Women,"Dena Dyer and Laurie Barker Copeland have created a laugh-out-loud (and sometimes cry-me-a-river) compilation of groovy stories from a variety of women in varying stages of life. It's the kind of book you can digest in small sittings, but may want to keep reading well into the night. I was especially happy to see my friend Leslie Wilson's piece entitled ""No Place Like Home."" If you're looking for a lighthearted, funny, and touching gift this Christmas, The Groovy Chicks' Road Trip To Peace may be what you're looking for."
1,Do not purchase,This coffee/cappuccino/espresso maker was very disappointing. It is made of a light plastic which feels and looks cheaply made. It also stopped working after using for 2 weeks. Now I have the inconvenience of packaging and returning. Back to square one.
1,BCO-130T leaks water,"Ok, I had this coffe machine for 15 months now. The first 10 months the thing work great. Then it started leaking water from under the machine. I bought a new water resivoir, thinking this would fix the problem. It did not. The coffee machine still makes good coffee and espresso, it just leaks evertime you use it. Never going to by Delonghi again."
1,Short-lived -- it's a lemon,"After reading other reviews, I purchased this machine about 18 months ago. As others mentioned, in the beginning it worked great. Steaming milk for a latte was simple. My real need was a programmable coffeemaker with auto-shutoff. It made great coffee for about a year, needing descaling only twice. Then I noticed that it was not soaking all the grinds, and the descaling warning lit more often. The steamer didn't work, either, and last weekend the coffee side stopped working. Now I'm left with an expensive, oversized espresso machine."
5,Randywnco,Delonghi bc0130t makes great coffee and espresso.I am happy with this product and will buy another for my daughter
3,"Great coffee, great espresso, phooey on the foam","I bought this unit to replace my Krups combo unit, which served me well for many, many years. I read all the reviews before I took the plunge. There must be something I missed.It makes excellent coffee.It makes excellent espresso.But oh man, that foamer is a dud. Some days it makes decent crema. Some days it makes milk with a few dying bubbles. We have experimented, doing the crema separately, doing it on top of the espresso, cold milk, super cold milk, washing the foaming unit in cold water before using, varying the freshness of the milk... I'm sure there are more variables we have tried. Results: sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.We've only had it a couple of months and are DESPERATE to buy a unit that works as well as my poor old Krups did, in its prime.If anyone has found the foaming secret, PLEASE tell me because my cappuccino and I are very sad most mornings."
1,It came broken,"I received this coffee/espresso machine as a graduation gift, and the very first time I tried to make coffee nothing happened!! I was so upset that this arrived broken.I haven't tried the espresso side of this machine but I plan to before I send this back. I'm really glad I purchased the 2-year warranty to protect myself though.Overall, after my experience and reading the poor comments of others, I would recommend that you DO NOT purchase this machine. Waste of time and money, and it breaks way too easily."
1,"Holy Floods, Batman...It's A Leak!","This product is a 100% piece of worthless junk.The company's ""Customer Disservice"" is also worthless. I wonder just how they're still in business.The unit will work fine for a few months. After that, it's a complete and utter mess. Don't bank on the milk frother to work very well. But you can certainly count on it leaking very bad and speaking to people who have no clue what customer service is supposed to be.DO NOT, under any circumstances, buy this product. Amazon should ban it from even being available on their website."
1,not good!,"I was sooo excited to get it, and almost exactly a year after owning it the esspresso crafe broke, then the water started leaking out of the bottom! Also the plastic hindge that hold the milk container in place broke as i was pushing it back into place! the water is not only leaking out of the bottom but now also through the side and filling up the area under the esspresso part! this machine is not worth the money by any means! Please for your own sake dont get it, you will waste your money! the company said they could fix what was wrong with it at my cost for everything.......not a good company or brand. Im not sure how they stay in business!"
3,good coffee,"Makes coffee rather well. I don't like the IFD (instant froth device) and would prefer to have the traditional steam tube on the side. If I had to purchase again, I would buy the 120 model instead."
1,costumer service?,"I got this machine as a wedding gift and was very happy with it. One day a small piece that fits into the filter holder broke during my washing. That was six months after I got the machine. Then I contacted delonghi's costumer service........After 3 weeks they sent me the wrong piece ( I won't even comment on the fact that the pice costs U$$3,00 and the shipping U$$10,00, as another reviewer had already pointed). I contacted then again and after 1 week I got another wrong piece.....Now I have been emailing them and they just won't reply....And, of course, my credit card has been charged!So I repeat...is that costumer service?That is definetely the worst service I ever got in this country!So I would advise everybody to stay away from it! Cause every now and then any machine will need some maintenance...."
1,boooooring,My first Adler book. Willing to give her another chance but will be a while before I do that.
4,I like it.,I like this MP3 player. Its music quanlity is good and easy to use. But 128M is a little small. I should have bought the 256M version.
3,How do you download music from the internet onto this player?,"I bought the macvision MA833A for my son, based on reviews (only bad ones seemed to say the manual is no good, which is true). It's been easy to transfer music from a CD onto the player, but we can't figure out how to transfer music from the internet!! For instance, my son purchased a couple songs from msn.com (99 cents each, they downloaded easily onto the computer (windows xp), but when we try to synchronize them onto the player, we get an error message.One of the reviewers said you can only copy CD music, because it won't play copyright protected files, and most of the music online is copyright protected. Is this everyone else's experience? I bought it to get music off the internet, and would appreciate any advice! (The manual and manufacturers website are no help, as others noted.)Thanks from a mom who is new to all this, and her son!!!"
3,"great mp3 player, but needs more memory","This mp3 players sound is great!! Its simple to use with w. media player. The only bad thing i can say about it is that it only holds 30-40 songs. I would suggest that you buy the one with bigger memory, spend the extra 20-30$ and get the bigger one. Thats all you need to know."
1,Unfortunately dissatisfied.,This MP3 player broke as soon as I tried to use the player. It only turned on once and would never could be turned on again.
3,Addresses an odd audience,"I just got back from Chile and I must say, I don't know what to think about this book. For example: it was the only guide book that I took with me into the Torres del Paine. And that was the right choice. On the other hand, it doesn't offer enough information about basic things, like cheap places to stay. For example, in Punta Arenas, the things in my price range aren't even mentioned in this book. They only start above it.but it does have some helpful insight about planning and seeing things in Chile. If you get this, it should certainly be along with other things like LP and Footprints. Then it can be a really good auxillary resource."
3,Fun for preschoolers,These cards are nice for teaching simple words to preschoolers but are overpriced.
1,Propaganda Movie,Within minutes of watching this film I knew it was just a bunch of BS. It makes me wonder about people who actually watch this film and believe such nonsense could be true.
5,Truth is a welcome thing.,"Wonderful movie. It's great to see movies like this that hopefully inform American citizens about the truth of the occupy movement. Sadly the networks and the media in general, as pointed out in the movie, ignore the facts. Breitbart is Here!"
1,not even funny,"I like to read, watch and learn everything from different perspectives but this one was just a bad, dirty propaganda. I didn't waste my time after 20 minutes and thank god I watch for free with amazon prime membership because $2 is too much for this ""thing"" (I am not gonna call it documentary, since I respect real documentaries)"
2,I'm a Breitbart fan but this was a disappointment,I'm a fan of Brietbart but this was yet another conservative journalism video piece that could have been edited down to five minutes. The only insights it offers could have been told in five minutes. The rest of it just dragged or repeated its thesis.
5,Andrew blew the top off of OWS,"It's hard to call this BS when it's right there, on tape, in front of your face. OWS was pre planned and there's no way to dispute it after watching this. It's only too bad they don't run this on 60 Min for everyone to see, but yeah right! The case is well laid out with emails from ""community organizers"" showing what they had planned to do in advance. I can easily see how the early 20-somethings could get tied up in the ""feel good and want to join-in"" of the entire movement. I get it. Then, the drugs and violence--wow, just wow! Everyone, should see this film. #WAR"
1,garbage,"They can make up this stuff and feed it to their faithful but here are some facts they left out:OWS and Tea Party: &#8232;&#8232;&#8232;&#8232;Public support for &#8232;OWS 54%, Tea Party 20%. &#8232;&#8232;&#8232;&#8232;Public against &#8232;OWS 23%, Tea Party 40%. &#8232;&#8232;&#8232;&#8232;Tea Party wealthier.&#8232;&#8232;&#8232;&#8232;Been to college &#8232;92% of OWS, 70% of Tea Party.&#8232;&#8232;&#8232;&#8232;Employed 70% OWS (23% students.),&#8232; 56% Tea Party (30% retired.)&#8232;&#8232;&#8232;&#8232;OWS younger.&#8232;&#8232;&#8232;&#8232;Biggest Political party: &#8232;OWS 70% Independent, &#8232;Tea Party 56% GOP."
4,Great Book for the Small Company,"I have successfully used this book at 2 companies as a guide to implement quality systems compliant with and registered to ISO 9001-2000. I just started with company #3. If you have less than 100 employees, this book is for you.Jodi M.Consultant and Trainer"
1,Not for the novice or the expert,"I was disappointed. If you don't know ISO 9001 this book will not help you much. If you know ISO 9001 you probably don't need this book. This expensive, slim volume was not very usefull for me. I got some information but not a clear overview of ISO 9001. I was looking for something like ""ISO for Dummies"". Limited scope, not very complete."
4,Not sure why this is rated like a toy....,"I use #11's daily. These name brand blades get the job done, but seem bulky and dull compared to 3rd party manufactures. I only bought these because they were less expensive (and name brand!), but I'll probably go back to my regulars once these are used up."
5,Warrant Review,"Just absolutely awesome, wonderful, breathtaking, I could go on and on......better yet, lemme just pop it in and play it...AGAIN!!!"
3,I expected more from this,"The film is okay but having seen other films with similar themes, I hoped for more. Perhaps that isn't fair. Watching this movie is the first I ever heard about the Knights of the South Bronx. It has its fun moments but for me, it isn't a memorable film. The price was right, though!"
4,Solid SAR Stories,"This was a great book, and very helpful to those just getting started in SAR. However, I wish I had known it was SO dog specific before I bought it. None of the reviews or the synopsis of the book mentioned its focus on SAR dogs. Again, a great book, but beware if you are not looking for search dog stories..."
5,Excellent Purchase,"Nothing fancy about this case, but was just glad I could still find a case for my 1st generation iPod nano. It fits perfectly and grips well to surfaces. Product arrived much sooner than anticipated and was exactly as described. My only complaint is that the shipping cost more than double the product itself, but I needed a case as soon as possible so in the end it was worth it."
1,Avoid!,"Have been reading this book as a part of my MBA program. I was truly looking forward to study the area of Marketing which I believe is one of the areas with the highest potential of being learned in an exiting way - With living examples and stories of brands, commercials etc.I read a lot of management books as a part of my job and this book is without a doubt the worst I have ever experienced. Boring, without passion and ambitions from page 1 and until the very end (if you somehow have the strength and stamina to reach last page).Embarrasing for professor Kotler - embarrasing for the Marketing area."
2,zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz......,"The book covers vital marketing concepts, however it drones on like no other textbook I have ever read. Read the book cover to cover and I would have to take off my socks to count the number of times I fell asleep in the process. Illustrates well with diagrams and examples, but this book actually succeeded in making me less interested in marketing."
1,Marked Up and Torn!!,The book was marked up and the cover was almost torn off. I use it because I have no choice but the state of the book was poor.
3,can't tell until spring but good reviews elsewhere.,This product was recommended by the author of the Ever Blooming Flower Garden which is a great book. Obviously I won't be able to judge the effects until spring. You use 1 teaspoon per gallon of water so a quart will last a long time.
2,Plug in not tight,"This fixture gives off a cheap yellowish tint rather than white light. The real aggravation is that the plug does not fit tightly into the fixture. The light frequently turns itself off, or won't turn on because the plug is loose. I had to tape it in place."
2,Not a pocket book,"I have been to the Louvre before and was overwhelmed with all the great sites to see. So this time I wanted a book to take with me so I could map out what I wanted to be sure and see. This book is very large so there is no way I can take it with me. One reviewer mentioned the organization was great and you could mark off what you see as you go through the museum. That is true the book is organized well and the pictures are great. A map is included in the front and back, but doesn't indicate the top ten must see pieces. The book is so large I will not be taking it with me. Am trying to decide if I should keep for the great pictures or return it. I really wanted to study it on the long flight and carry with me to the museum, but not possible."
4,Good floor cleaner,"This does a good job cleaning floors. It doesn't miss any spots and my rooms smell & look really clean after using this. I recommend it for in between deep cleanings. This doesn't get into corners, under cabinets, etc. Make sure to clean it out well in between each use to maintain it. I have not had any maintenance issues. Good for really large open rooms. If you plan to use this for a small room, just get out a mop and do it yourself. It will be less time consuming. You have to take it apart, clean it out. I am impressed at what a good cleaning job it does. It has cleaned up some tough dirt on my floors."
4,iRobot 5800 Scooba Floor-Washing Robot,"It's a wonderful way to make mopping without human's efforts.The good time for using of the Scooba is then we are going out from the home.It has a good navigation and cleans more time in the especial dirt places.But I got it with relative weak battery, and it took a lot of time to recharge the battery."
1,Avoid at all costs,"I used to be a strong proponent of Roomba products, and I thought the Scooba would work well, too. However, the newer products, both Roomba and Scooba, have very unpredictable battery life. It's not clear whether you should leave the batteries on the charger or unplug them, and it seems like the instructions are the opposite for both the Roomba and Scooba. This confusion caused my batteries to no longer hold a charge after only 10 uses. Customer service, which used to be very user-friendly, refused to replace a battery for free. I've been on a waiting list for a new water tank for almost a year because of difficulty opening it. It's a shame. I always used to recommend Roomba products to all my family and friends, but I can no longer do so with a clear conscience. While I still use my original model Roomba vacuum, I find it much, much easier to wash the floors with a mop than with the Scooba."
1,"Five returns, still doesn't work","When I first bought the scooba, I thought it preformed well . . . until I tried using it a second time. It wouldn't clean and the ""check tank"" light came on. Despite thoroughly cleaning the device and disassembling it while on the phone with tech support, the results were the same. I ended up sending the device back, and a new one arrived from Irobot about a week later. This scooba had the exact same problem as the last. This process repeated three more times, so I now own my fourth useless scooba. Irobot won't give refunds, but I intend to keep asking for a new scooba every week until they send me one that works."
3,I hate washing floors,"This is no comparison to hand scrubbing, but it does a good job and you don't have to do anything but push the power button. I have pets and its a great way to keep the floors clean."
1,Buyer Beware!!!,"Clearly at first this was an awsome gift!!! It worked great! Then after a year sadly, it did not! If you look at the reviews that have had them that long you will find this to be common. Also read battery reviews ect, individual parts! The hood would no longer come off , it no longer soaked up water or vacuummed! I did keep it very clean , followed directions and also did what another person suggested kept theres longer then a year, which I now believe was a fluke, and not the norm that they had thier's longer but only by four months. I did not use it but once a week on an average maybe even smaller size floor. So if you think 500+ a year is worth it, go for it and enjoy! I'd rather go to Cancun for a week!"
3,bigtex68,"My wife said we wood keep, and for me to order all parts needed,I got the service manual and parts from irobot 150.00"
1,An expensive robot that may not work!,"This is not ""Rosie"" from the Jetsons. After over two years of use, the machine will only start up 10% of the time. Very disappointing for an expensive little item. On top of that, I have spent hours with iRobot customer service, trying numerous ""fixes"" that often don't work. I bought mine brand new for almost $400. Ask yourself, is it worth $200/yr for an item that won't reliably work? You gotta really hate cleaning floors to put up with the hassle of this product."
3,scooba review,Scooba does what it claims but the dirty water has to be emptied and the hot water or cleaning agent refilled fairly frequently. We use it for a good floor cleaning not a daily scrubber
4,Robotics in its Infancy,"Robotics are predicted to take over most household tasks in the future. But, at this point, we are still in the first generation of practical robots, and they aren't perfect by any means. We have two short-haired dogs that shed like crazy, so we use a Roomba and Scooba to keep the hair down to acceptable levels. They both clean while we are at work. Neither replaces a thorough manual cleaning. But, it is SO wonderful to come home at night after a rough day and not have to vacuum or mop to live in a fairly clean house. These are good for special situations, but are not replacements for manual cleaning."
2,Cleans well when it works...,"This little machine does a wonderful job of cleaning/drying floors. Mine stopped working at approximately the 13th month. I used this for in-between the times I washed my floors by hand, all in all it was used no more than a dozen times. An expensive disappointment..."
1,Terrible - returned it,"This product skimmed over the dirt. We have two dogs, a cat and a child, and I was hoping (praying!) that if I used this daily, it would keep my kitchen floor clean and save me the trouble. This product wasn't intended for real dirt. It slides over it. I've discovered that when it comes to mopping the kitchen floor, there's no way to avoid elbow grease on my part. I purchased and returned this over a year ago - was looking at old purchases and decided to share my mistake in getting this one. So far magic eraser mops and effort on my part seem to be the only things that work on cleaning up the orange mud that ends up on my floors."
3,Wouldn't believe it,"I bought it for my sister, I have the 500 series because I have carpet upstairs. She been nuts over mine but she needed one that clean n mops the floor. I read all about it, to good to be truth so as soon as it arrived n charged for 24 hours. We put it to work. At first I was like nah but it did the do. It mops better then the cleaning it do but it work pretty good. She is pretty happy, no complaints YET."
2,Don't be tempted by the novelty...,"Like many others here, the unit did NOT work right out of the box! The Check Tank button repeatedly lit, despite following all the ""tips"" for addressing the problem. Finally sat on the floor next to it, hitting Power, Power, Clean everytime the check tank button lit. After 20-30 button hit cycles, it finally started up. Lets see, its 11 pm now, it started cleaning 2 hours ago. I figure by morning the kitchen, (less than 100 sq feet!) might finally be cleaned! If I had gotten off my backside, I could have swept and mopped the kitchen, and vacuumed and shampooed the living room carpet! Steer clear of this useless ""toy."""
2,"Good for a while, but one year warrant is not enough and a lot of maintenance",For three and four hundred dollars most IRobot products only last for about a year. If you open them up you will see repaired circuit boards. Save yourself some time and money buy Hoover products. They don't run themselves but they don't need as much maintenance. They need to increase their warranty for thier products before I but another one. I have bought over four vacumn cleaners and a scooba and they work well for a year and then have a lot of trouble. If you have money to waste it is a good product.
5,X-Acto blades,"Blades were exactly as shown and advertised. Quick shipping and the price was just right. Sometimes difficult to find things I need on the island, so rely on Amazon a lot. They do a great job.Bud"
4,Works for me,"They are x-acto blades, sharp and small. It will take me a while to use them all. Until I finish, there they sit, on my desk while I cut some stuff."
4,"Review - X-Acto X611 #11 Blades for X-Acto Knives, Bulk Pack, 100 Blades per Box",We go thru quite a few of these blades reworking electronic assemblies. Purchasing the 100 pack is much more economical and efficient.
5,"Women, Women, Women...gotta love ya!","Initially my thoughts were, ""another girl book"". I was wrong! I enjoyed it very much. The author has a unique style that kept me wanting more. Kudos, MS. Benitez. I can imagine this on the big screen...wish I had the money to invest...it would make millions. I recommend this novel 100%. It's a fast and easy read that sends you through some interesting drama."
1,Purchased and returned 2 of these.,"I had to replace a Farenheit DVD player in my van that failed. I purchased one of these and after spending a hour installing it, discovered that it would not eject a DVD. I returned it for a replacement and installed the replacement one. The second one would not sync. Returned the second one and purchased a different brand. So: 2 hours of my time +$24 in return postage wasted on this item."
2,not necessary to insert philisophical viewpoints,"while the kids may enjoy at least some of the music, it seems unnecessary to turn a simple song (eensy weensy spider) into some philisophical discussion by suggesting that the young audience repeat ""existentialism"" and have the singer refer to ""big spider, little spider.""i've gotten into the habit of buying, at one time, several of a child's music cd to use as gifts, etc. i had hoped that this cd would serve that purpose, but on the whole, it doesn't. easier for me to burn one cd for my use from several of this singer's cd's and leave the philisophical garbage out of it."
5,An excellent reference book that I turn to every week.,"As a novice dealer of new and antique dinnerware, this book has been an invaluable resource for identification and valuation. You will not learn a lot about any one manufacturer in this book because it focuses on the most desirable PATTERNS, featuring clear photos and basic pricing information. I find myself leafing through it often, even when I'm not looking for a particular pattern. If you don't specialize in one manufacturer's wares, but buy and sell a lot of different patterns, you really shouldn't be without this handy reference book. I hope Mr. Rinker will team up with Replacements to produce Volume II - The Top 1000 Patterns, 501-1000."
5,Testimonial for The Passion Principles,A truly inspiring book that everyone should read.I learned a lot from it.
2,Disappointed,"I thought I was purchasing the best kickball available. This is what a lot of schools use! I was excited to get it and when I went to blow it up, it started leaking air out of the valve. Cannon was very good about getting me a replacement at no cost, but the 2nd one was even worse. It leaked out the sides. I hope I just got a couple duds because the ball seems of great quality, I would just be wary of purchasing it when you need to use it right away."
2,A book from a genealogical perspective,"Mr. Hindley's book is an excellent introduction for novices to the Royal Houses of Europe. Unfortunately, for those who have studied the subject, especially the genealogical side, it is fraught with errors which detract from the better aspects of the book."
3,excelente...!,excelente disco...! a quien se lo obsequie no deja de escucharlo...! : : : : : : : : :
2,boring book cliche`,"i'm sorry to say this, but i didn't enjoy reading this book. even though it's considered a great book that has actual events that happened, i think that anne frank has been played to many times. if you are looking for a good book about the holocaust, i suggest another book. maybe Alicia: my story by alicia appleman-jurman"
5,Anne Frank,"This is one of the most tragic stories i have ever heard, ever!I first read the story when i was in the second grade.Now i'm in the fifth grade and i still love the story!I think that this book is for everyone.And i hope you want to read this book, wether it is for a report or fun i am sure you will love this book almost as much as i did!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!P.S.So not possible!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,"Sturdy, well made tool","I wasn't sure what to expect after I read the reviews, but what I got was a good, solid tool. It's thick, looks like it's made from one piece of metal, and the wood handle was attached very tightly. This is one of my new favorite kitchen tools. It works perfectly with the 14"" wok I got."
1,Very Poor Quality,"I recommend that the manufacturer stop making this item. Very poor quality. Handle wobbles very badly. Metal finish peeling off and wooden handle is stained and this is supposed to be a new item! This was taken out of the package like this. The seller should also stop selling it. I was going to send it back, but not worth it since you forfeit the shipping costs. Buyer beware!"
3,VOL. 2-PLANET V,"Very well rounded, simi down tempo drum&bass..Really moody sounds, very good old style d&b. Execellent mixing tool."
3,VERY CUTE,"VERY CUTE, BUT NOT AS USFULL AS ALL THE OTHER PAKS CONTAINERS I PURCHASED. THE ONLY PROBLEM FOR ME IS THAT THIS SNACK PAK IS JUST A LITTLE TO SMALL. I WAS A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED BECAUSE YOU CON NOT PUT ANY LIQUIDS INTO THIS CONTAINER FOR SAFE KEEPING, THE LID IS NOT EQUIPPED FOR THAT."
3,its okay,"This album has its moments, and its better than most of what's out there. It is very very radio friendly. If i were just listening to the music without the vocals, there's no way i would guess that Ogre had anything to do with this album. It sounds like a darker version of Garbage. I can't really rave about it though. I like almost everything else i've heard from the puppies's side projects better than this album. Still though, its worth buying."
3,Maybe a little too tight?,"I got this bag to carry my POD XT Live, and while the effects unit fits in the case, it's a struggle to get it in there and still have all the padding in the right place to protect everything. Maybe it'll stretch out a little over time, but an extra half inch would have made the bag a LOT easier to use and wouldn't compromise any protection.If I had it to do over, I'd buy the POD X3 Live case, because it's designed to fit a device that's about 1 inch larger."
5,Very Nice,I bought this so when I went over to Europe I could carry this with ease. It did just that very comfortable to carry around that huge pedal in. I definitely recommend this so no one has to carry around that huge box it comes in.
3,signing for babies,I think signing is a valuable tool for communicating w/young babies who can't yet express w/words. These cards provide basic everyday used wordsin simple sign language. My daughter uses them regularly and it's terrific.
5,Entertaining and easy to read!,I first read these when I was younger and loved them. I have since read them again and still find them enjoyable. Very entertaining stories that even kids can read. I would recommend them.
4,Good Star Wars Adventures,"In this volume, 3 Han Solo Novellas are gathered together.""Han Solo At Stars End""-Han gets dragooned into rescueing dissidents from a private prison, run by the megacorporation called the Corporate Sector.""Han Solo's Revenge""-Slavers trick Han, & try to steal his ship. Han wants to get even, & he wants those 10,000 Galactic Credits somebody owes him, OR ELSE!!""Han Solo And The Lost Legacy""-Han & Chewbacca, tempted by visions of wealth (what else is new?) get into a treasure hunt. And are pursued by a dangerous quickdraw killer.Overall, the series could be a little better written, but it is still fun, and 3-for-1 is a bargain.The Hipster gives it a Big Thumbs UP!"
4,Han and chewy in the corpoate sector,"These three novels were actually written in 1979 and 1980, long before the Zahn trilogy kicked of what we now know as the EU Expanded Universe. Daley also did the radio dramatizations of the original movie trilogy. Daley also created the corporate sector. Note that almost nothing is ever written about the Corp Sector, but there it is on the NJO maps of the galaxy. Also, AC Crispen wrote his Han Solo trilogy in a manner that accommodates Han and Chewy's trip to the CS.I have placed this trilogy on the timeline at -4.9 BNH, taking place between The Hutts Gambit and Rebel Dawn (books 2 and 3 of the HST).These are the first known non-Lucas novels of the SW universe. I am not sure whether they actually pre-date the SW comic strips, but surely Daley is the real father of the EU. If you are a Han Solo fan, this trilogy is a must addition to you library. My copy is the june 1992 edition found at a garage sale."
1,Not in depth stories and pretty ridiculous,"This book accounts for a set of stories by Han Solo almost 1 year previous to the battle of Yavin.The three stories are somewhat poor imagined and narrated. The mainframe of the story around Solo's adventures and misfits in the Corporate Sector.Although we are reading Sci-Fi and fantastic and almost unreal things happen on these tales, the plot surpasses that barrier and makes it ridiculous and unbelievable at most (especially on the first story).Han Solo has a fascinating personality and its better depicted in his other trilogy by AC Crispin."
4,Everybody loves Han!,"If you are curious about what Han Solo was like before he enters the scene in A New Hope, these are the books for you. They are filled with action that keeps you interested from beginning to end.I read these books immediately after reading The Lando Calrissian Adventures, and I have to say that these are MUCH better. Han and Chewie seem exactly as I would have pictured them during that time period. A. C. Crispin references these books in the 3rd book of her Han Solo Trilogy entitled Rebel Dawn. That's what motivated me to read Daley's books, and I have to say that if you want to learn about Han's past, her books are much better."
5,Excellent book....,"I just passed the CPA exam usign this collection -- excellent books! I can't recommend it enough. Plus I bought it using a coupon from UnderTag.com, so it was a bargain for me."
3,NOT UNIQUE ENOUGH,"Miss Ross sounds pretty darn good in most of her cuts here, but you gotta love Diana and you gotta love JAZZ and BLUES. If you hated Lady Sings the Blues, then you will probably not like this collection. If you loved it, then you will find some good music and Ross at what she does best; sing within the strength of her vocals. MY MAN still remains my favorite cut ever. Some of these other cuts can put you to sleep but remember Diana Ross is a stylist of sorts with her own unique voice and charm. She is no powerhouse Diva in the vocal arena. If you want the cutesy-pie pop music of ""Baby Love"" or disco Ross as in ""The Boss"", you shouldn't spend your money. If you just appreciate the vocal renditions of this former lady of The Supremes and anything that she sings, then it will bring you much joy. Its better than average, however there is nothing exceptional or compelling about it."
1,Fan from the 60's,"I love Diana Ross! However, Please do not waste your money on this!There is no production theme at all. I can fully appreciate if this album was recorded and never released. It should still be lost. I expected a ""Billie Holiday"" type album. Instead the tracts are uneven and non-satisfying. The worst is ""I loves ya Porgy."" I have never heard such a mess. I thought I would just program the CD player to skip this one , but the remaining tracks were not much better. Sadly, the best place for this CD is in the trash can. Lady Ross has hit rock bottom with this one. Stick to the Motown sound sweetie. You're no Ella, Lena, or Etta. Please go back to the standards I love!"
3,Very elementary,"If your English level is intermediate or upper don't buy these DVDs. They are very elementary. In spite of have being well produced, It is for begginers."
2,ring,I know it is a cheap ring but advertisement makes product seem better then it is..I would not buy this product again
4,"A good, but not great, sequel","I really enjoyed Many Coloured Land and this was a vey good sequel that moved the story forward substantially. I enjoyed the book very much but did not quite enjoy it the much as the prior one, Still, a very good read."
4,A Good Selection Of Scenes,"If you are into acting,want to make movies,write them or just watch them,this book is a lot of fun to flip through. Most of the scenes aren't from big ""playing everywhere"" movies so you don't have to worry about imitating someone else's performance. And with the few that are,it's a good exercise in how to make a charactor""yours"" instead of DeNiro's (for example.) A worthwhile scene-book to own."
5,Girl who LOVED the book!,"This book is the best i have ever read. I cried at the end, becouse my sister and i are aexactly like thatm and i would DIE without her. This book is absutly awsome and isnt atall fake or unrealsitc. i defintily recomened it and hope you enjoy it. <3"
1,Sr,"Cameta Digital Slave Flash: It's a bad product, to day it's out of service for several problem caused in the electric system, the batery caused fire."
4,Spiritual Reflections by the Judds,"Overall the CD is just wonderful. However, one song ""Star of Bethlehem"" seems to be more appropriate for a Christmas song vice a spiritual song. I would still recommend this CD for every song sounds just beautiful."
3,Picture is Not Representative of Actual Color,"I bought this as a Christmas gift for my boyfriend but was really disappointed when I got it. The quality of the bag is very nice; leather is a nice quality leather... However, the coloring in the picture is a bit deceiving. I purchased the brown bag.The coloring of the bag is much darker, almost an espresso color and the stiching is very gold... As soon as I took the bag out of the box, all I noticed was the stiching... not the bag. I thought it was just me but asked my mom what she thought. She too thought the stiching was just too much and took away from the bag itself.I sent the bag back and got a refund. I have to say, it was a painless transaction and was very impressed by how easy it was to get a refund. I really wish the sitching matched the actual bag color because it would have been a home run."
5,Great bag!,"My husband absolutely loves this bag. It fits all his files plus a 15"" laptop. The leather is an excellent quality and stands up against the weather. We would highly recommend this men's bag."
4,"Love the bag, hate the strap","I bought this bag as a gift and I was so excited to have found it for so cheap (tag on the bag says it retails for $400...) I love the look of the leather and the bag is absolutely perfect for its intended user. However, when I went searching for the strap I was disappointed to see that the strap was made of nylon-eqsue material, similar to the strap on my $10 gym bag. I searched online to try to find a nice leather strap but apparently they don't exist. I really do love the bag and intend on keeping it (and will just pray that the person likes the strap or only uses the handle) but beware if you're looking for a bag with a matching strap!"
3,it's a laptop bag not really luggage.,Beautiful leather. Very well made. However clearly made for holding a laptop computer rather than anything else. Pretty good anyway.
5,Everything I wanted,"Looks good & solid Construction. I use it to carry m 13"" ultrabook and accesories, but it could hold up to a 15"". Delivery was quick."
3,Definitely worthwhile for Todd fans,"I ORIGINALLY WROTE THIS WHEN I WAS ABOUT 19 AND ON A HUGE TODD RUNDGREN KICK. I HAVE SLIGHTLY REVISED IT SLIGHTLY SINCE THEN TO PULL IT MORE IN LINE WITH MY CURRENT VIEW OF THE ALBUM. THE REVIEW MAY STILL SHOW SIGNS OF IMMATURE TASTE OR YOUTHFUL OVER-ENTHUSIASM.This is another collection of pop songs from the Rundgren, very much in the vein of Something/Anything and the two Runt albums except with the synthesizers characteristic of his post-Utopia albums. Not quite as stellar as Something/Anything, Todd, and A Wizard, A True Star; but still a very solid release worthy of purchase after you own the aforementioned albums."
1,False advertisement?,"In the product description it states ""Product Description60 Count, 5"" x 3"", Open Side Memo Book. (Sold in 12-Pk. Only)"" This lead me to believe this was a 12 pack. Surprise, it arrived in the mail today. I paid $8 for 1 little memo pad. I got ripped off."
5,Refreshing and quirky........,"Just from the description of the story on the back cover, I knew I would like this book. As I started reading, I found myself unable to put the book down. It is written in a refreshingly quirky style, that I can't say I have seen in anything else I have read.The story touched me, as I have recently lost a beloved member of my family (though not a ""spouse"") and could really relate to a lot of what Jessica was feeling regarding the loss of John. It also, in a way, reminded me of the loss of an old flame from my life, though he is not dead in reality, just to me emotionally.I think anyone looking for a deep, emotional read should pick up a copy of this book."
1,This book is a joke,"I unfortunately recommended this book for my book club (I can't for the life of me remember where I read a good review of this book). It was like reading poorly written soft porn. We all had a good laugh though and decided we would re-gift it as a White Elephant present. Luckily, I didn't get booted out of my book club!"
1,Sportswriters revenge,"Maury Allen's book mentions, numerous times, that Thurman Munson was not a nice man. He was rude to fans, waitresses, and Heaven Forbid-sportswriters. Allen happily mentions that he has never wasted one vote on Munson in Hall of Fame votes. In fact, not voting for him appears to be revenge for Munson not giving quotes and quips for Allen's stories in the New York Post. This is precisely the reason sportswriters should not vote for Hall of Fame inductions; as Allen states, the writers vote on what they thought of the ballplayer as a ""man"", not as a clutch ballplayer, who always came through when his team really needed him to. And we all know, if you don't show respect to sportswriters, you don't deserve to be in the Hall of Fame. Sportswriters believe, that since they know how to put two sentences together, they are more important than the players they write about. Gotcha, Maury. And go to Hell."
2,Skip It,"I bought this book thinking it was about George Steinbrenner...but The Boss turns out to be nothing more than a supporting character in his own story. There's next to nothing about him.The book is also confusing and reads more like the author's memoirs. He'll start telling a story, then go off on a tangent into the past (which can last anywhere from two sentences to two pages) and then suddenly he's back at the original thought. It was nearly impossible to follow.I'm a huge Yankee fan and have read lots of books on the team...there are better ones out there. This definitely isn't one of them."
4,Really Enjoyed,"A very good book with a twist but, in the end love will find a way.Pick up your copy today."
4,Excellent resource for those new to feng shui,"I read several books on feng shui before this one-mostly slogging through all the history and technical information that was not at all useful to me. Then I found Ms. Collins book. She presents just enough history and technical information to be useful, and offers many simple and practical ideas which can change the energy of your home and your life. The pictures were very helpful in illustrating how a few small changes can dramatically change the energy of a whole room. I highly recommend this book."
4,Enlightening,This book was a great introduction to Feng Shui. Prior to purchasing the book I had only heard a little about the practice. I found it to be intriguing; a relaxing read and the advice easy to follow. Decorating the Feng Shui way is wonderful way to do it. A true pack rat like myself can truly benefit from advice offered in this book!
3,This book was excellent!,"I read 5 different Feng Shui books before I found this one. It was excellent. Very useful... we were actually able to make effective changes. I haven't read the first book by the author, but this one stands on it's own. The one item that I found confusing was the Chapter on the Bague Map. It didn't give an easy way to accurately apply to your home and I had to refer to another book. Overall, it was most helpful in making pratical changes and to help you think in Feng Shui ways."
2,Out of Order,"Although I refer to this book frequently, I was disturbed by one aspect of the book - - namely, that some of its pages are out of order. I think that the publisher shouldn't have let it go out of the warehouse. Too lazy to send it back."
1,Never received my DVD!,"I watched this on television and enjoyed it so much that I ordered it from Amazon. I have, however, not received this order."
4,I'm reminded of another holiday movie...,"While watching ""Nothing Like the Holidays"" I was repeatedly reminded of the touching/dramatic/ridiculous/hilarious ""Home for the Holidays"" (directed by Jodie Foster). Dysfunctional family gets together for a holiday, hilarity ensues.Both movies feature similar themes: family member in denial, family member with career troubles, family with an emotional struggle, and so on. And both movies were hilarious. ""Home..."" was funny in a mostly dry-witted manner, while ""Nothing..."" is nearly pie-in-the-face funny.But the seasonal message from both movies is the same: Spend time with your family; whether you want to not.Nothing Like the Holidays is a solid entry into the modern family editions of Christmas Movies."
2,"Story was good, writing was poor","There is the potential here for a very powerful story. Unfortunately, the author's writing is rather poor. Even though I sympathize with their plight, I thought the author did not ""show"" the struggle of the people so much as ""pontificate"" about the struggles of the people. That is why I gave this book only 2 stars. I could barely finish reading the book. The writing turned me off. This book was a disappointment."
1,shorted or used,ordered three bottles got one full and used are half full email auto alley abut this did not get answerthis was tst 40266 max
3,oddball ointment book,"This book is interesting. It isn't the way I'd write or talk. Nor is it as powerful and readily available as the title, but it's interesting to read once in awhile. It has ideas you'd perhaps never guess, but anyone that has a good imagination deserves to see this book at least. More articles and warnings than information, perhaps you'll like it and perhaps you won't, but will wish to keep it."
1,Disappointing,"In a nutshell, the author attempts to analyse the rise of Islamic extremism in Turkey (and the wider Middle East) and present this in a simplistic (and very dreary) manner that is obviously aimed at the (uninformed) Western reader. The story, set in a bleak miserable town, is so incredibly boring that I have been trying unsuccessfully to read it for over a year, and have reached the conclusion that if the Nobel Committee chose to award Pamuk based on this, then their criteria could not have included literary talent. There are several other Turkish and Arab writers whose works are far superior. Turkish speakers with whom I have discussed this are of the view that Pamuk's talent perhaps does not translate well, and that reading him in the original language is a different experience."
2,"Review of Orhan Pamuk's ""Snow""","Ordinarily I do not try to review books, but this time I need to do so. I am half-way through the book and wondering what it is that makes this book important. Searching the Web I discover that Mr Pamuk is making waves today with some statements that may be misinterpreted by some. He has said that he didn't try to be political, but has become that way. I have found the book tiresome, now I won't finish it. I do see that he has serious points to make. Good luck, readers. JaneInIndy"
2,I'm Sorry,"Snow is boring. I read, My Name is Red, by Pamuk and was floored! WHAT A BOOK !Snow? Everyone I know (4 including me) who read Snow, didn't finish it. Don't judge Pamuk by this book!"
4,A Snippit in Time from Turkey,"Fastpaced, rich in detail, and seemingly an allegory within an allegory - Snow is a beautiful and suspenseful read. My test for all fiction is whether or not I give a damn about the characters and Snow does not disappoint. I was intrigued by the way Pamuk weaves political/religious and east/west threads through the story while at the same time speaking to indivdual self-doubt, love, loss, death... Look forward to reading more by this author."
3,Covered Islamic Women,"Very interesting portrait of present day Turkey, specially useful to understand the issue of covered islamic women which is current in Europe these days.Not the kind of book you cannot let down or cannot wait to get back to read.The NY Times' label of Best Book of the Year may be an overrating."
3,Put Your Head Down and Get Through It,"This is a book that is more about ideas than people---sort of (if I may use a way-out analogy)a George Bernard Shaw play. How might we characterize it? Somewhat didactic?Also, it's hard for me personally to finish a novel where I don't like the main character.I feel like I'm in a snowstorm. I have to keep going because I don't want to leave the author in the cold, but it's page 300 already and the weather isn't clearing up yet.What was the fuss about this book anyway? There are PARTS of it that are very interesting, but the whole doesn't seem to work. I might have preferred this book broken up into short stories, which don't really require a definitive ending and/or resolution.Now that I think of it, I hate everybody in this book. That can't be good, right?"
2,For those who enjoy non-fiction maskerading as fiction,"Orhan Pamuk is a very fine writer, and there are numerous gripping and moving passages. But the author's endless political, religious, and social diatribes are tiring; they would be more rewarding in a straight, non-fiction prose. Perhaps then the author could paint a realistic love story--here but a fishnet--without wooden characters obliterated in a sea of philosophical thought."
2,Could be instructive,"I tried & tried to finish this book, but it was too dense & stifling. It does open an interesting window on Islamist issues &, in that respect, is a valuable learning tool for those who wish to delve into these issues. It doesn't work as a novel, though. The characters are flat & create little empathy with the reader. The conversations were stilted & weighed heavily with deep, philosophical ramblings. In the end, I felt mired in leaden prose."
2,Dry as toast,"I found it nearly impossible to get into the narrative of this book. Orhan Pamuk's style of writing here is distanced, very dry, intellectualized. A love story is presented in the most remote way; its dialogue is as flat and formal as any I've read, given the context. I wonder if this has to do with an overly literal translation. Sorry to say, this is one of the dullest books that's crossed my path in a long time."
4,purchase comments,the comments regarding the description of the spatula were accurate.the spatula's were received within the promised delivery time frame and were well- pacakaged.other reviews concerning the product noted that the wooden handle ends were not attached.i would concur and recommend that it should be a simple matter to correct this small discrepancy.
3,Fair book,"Several typographical errors in the book, some within the answer key. OK book to use if still in school and you have access to your teachers to double check anything that is very off base. Fair book to supplement other resources when studying for the PTA exam if you have the extra cash and time to spare."
1,Disappointed Brooklyn Mom,"Too loud and the water evaporates way too quickly. I feel like I'm constantly filling the container w/ water. Though my son is a sound sleeper, it is difficult to hear him through the baby monitor b/c of the loudness of the humidificr. I would not buy this item."
1,Too Loud,"We turned it on for the first time, and it sounded like we were running the vacuum. We couldn't even leave it on long enough to see what kind of output (how humid it would make the room) it would have. This thing's going back!"
2,Poor quality.,Low quality and way too big for the stated size. Found out that Goldtoe sells socks for kids (which are awesome) so these will probably be in our next garage sale.
5,Solid Performer,"Great little optical mouse. Not too big, not too small. Purchased this for my laptop. Most mouses made for laptops are just too small. Mouse is accurate and has some great features. I especially like the enlargement function I use when I edit photos. I would highly recommend this product to anyone."
4,Logitech,This mouse is easy to use with excellent mobility. I like it and would recommend to others.
1,Great mouse.... if it starts to work again,"After 3 months of use, this mouse completely stopped working. None of the buttons worked, mouse would hardly move on screen. I thought it was the batteries, so I swapped in brand new ones and again still did not work. Maybe that's why it was only $9.99 on sale, will be going in for warranty service."
3,Not sure what rating I should use,"I ordered another LX7 mouse because I have owned 3 of them for several years with NO problems. Got this last one, took it out, hooked it up, and nothing. It would not do anything at all. Wouldn't move, wouldn't allow the use of the scroll, no buttons. Just dead. I love these and it is disappointing that this one was bad, and now I can't find another one. Guess it is time to change to something new."
3,Too Small,"It is a little small for my hand and I wanted a laser mouse and not an optical mouse, I am returning and buying the LX8."
1,Not where it,"Not funny at all, I remeber seeing this movie I spliit a side it has changed. I murphy bed is cute but worth it."
1,This product is a fraud !,"As I'm a usually satisfied customer, I'm very sorry to say that this product is a fraud. The content is no news to anybody who shows at least a little interest in Miss Monroe. 'Suicide, truth or fiction' has been many times played on TV, but let's say it is OK. But as regards the documentary, it is completely useless. I saw this week on the cable a doc that was 10 times better ! And the sound ... The sound of this DVD is just incredibly awful. Please believe me and don't buy that !"
3,Not Much Flavor,"I have tried Capella's Cinnamon Danish, and French Vanilla and was very pleased with them so when I saw Pumpkin Pie I thought mmmm sounds good. I was very disappointed to find that there is little flavor in the Pumpkin Pie Drops. I only need about two drops with the other flavors, but I need about ten drops with this flavor, and still can't taste much pumpkin pie."
4,Great to read the old goodies......but,"The book was in great condition in all areas, but I won't make the mistake of getting three books in one again. The size is too ungainly for comfort."
5,"The 1st,, 2nd & 3rd deadly sins",I haven't finished reading the 3rd as of yet. And so far the indvidual 4th deadly sin is my favorite with the 1st also excellant. The only disappointment so far was the 2nd which really took too long to develop.
1,"bad radio, worse pedometer","For $20 this looked like it could be a nice light radio for walking/jogging, with a bonus pedometer. The radio has no channel display, and the only setting is a reset button to go the bottom of the dial, then a scan button. When walking, it loses the station occasionally - luckily my prefered station is at the bottom of the dial, but if yours isn't this could be terribly annoying. As for the pedometer, it jumps by 10 steps just from clipping it on my waistband, and several times went zooming thru 20 or 30 steps when I was holding it perfectly still - thus worthless. I'm sending it back."
4,Nice Book,"Great book for sailors. Good format & lovely photography. Amazon packaging is horrible on all the books I've ordered though. Smashed edges, loose spines. No bookstore would dream of selling books in that condition. Too late to return as they were presents. Very disappointed."
1,erotica-not,"I love a good sexy novel. In fact I like a good, explicit sexy novel. But this book is discusting! With graphic male and female homosexuality, group sex, and voyeurism this book would be hard core porn if it had pictures."
4,Very HOT and well-written!,"Cooking Up A Storm really held my attention through the first third. It has a good plot that's not about saving the world, but is believable and interesting. Hunky Storm is ready for a change in both women and job, when he comes across an ad posted by a Cape Cod restaurant in need of a chef. The photo of the restaurant strikes a chord with him. He had a rough childhood softened by a kind woman who taught him to love cooking, and he longs for a home. This restaurant looks homey--perfect. He applies for the job and hits it off with Abby, the owner.The sex in this book is really well-described and different enough that it held my attention. I didn't like that after Abby and Storm bond and are really close, Abby has a quickie with another man she doesn't care about.Still, I recommend this book. It's far better than many other hot/erotic books I've read. Emma Holly is an auto-buy for me. Also recommend her Fairyville. But my fav of hers is Menage."
3,Distracted By Heroine's Recklessness,"The plot is thin but sometimes you read erotica not for the plot but for the hot sex! I didn't enjoy this story as much because I was distracted by how Abby did not protect herself. She's a business owner, she's intelligent (one would think), she has a college degree.And yet, she has unprotected sex with Storm on their second coupling. She has unprotected sex with Jack on their first coupling. She has unprotected sex with Peter on their first coupling. This novel is not based in the 70s where such behavior would be acceptable. I kept thinking about all the diseases that they could pass to each other. Doesn't help when reading erotica.I enjoyed Marissa and Jack's coupling more than Abby and Storm's."
2,OK read,"This book did not have much in the way of character development. I didn't feel as if I really ""knew"" the main protagnist and some of her reasons for doing things. Many of her choices made me stop and flip back a few pages because there was no indication that she would go to some of the extremes she went to. If you like quick little sexual romps that have no rhyme or reason this book may be for you."
1,Pure Porn,I had read Beyond Innonence and while it contained explicit sex there was also a well developed romance. This book is nothing more than one sex scene featuring a nymphomaniac followed by another scene ad infinitum. There is no plot to speak of and no romance. If all you want is porn then buy this. If you want some romance skip this one.
3,Please get a proofreader,"The premise for the book was interesting and the only thing that kept me reading since there were grammatical and/or spelling errors on each page. I found myself forever re-reading sentences and whole paragraphs trying to make sense of what was written or in most cases trying to determine what was intended. Who edited this book? If it was done by a professional, then fire that person! Future tense mixed with past and present throughout the book. If any proofreading was performed, it was by by spell check only, which as anyone knows will not catch the use of wrong words (i.e., to vs. too or hear vs. here, etc.). The author should do herself a favor and hire an editor or at the very least a good proofreader who is familiar with this time period (especially in creating dialog that transports you)."
5,Boxxed In? This is the Book For You,"The victims of the narcissist's abusive conduct feel hemmed in, trapped, isolated, and annulled. This book help them re-emerge and regain mastery of their lives. If you want to know what it is really like being the victim of relentless abuse by narcissists - buy this book. It masterfully combines numerous first hand accounts of survivors with a deep knowledge of the disorder. Recommended! Sam Vaknin, author of Malignant Self Love - Narcissism Revisited."
2,"Sorry, not well written","I looked forward to this book, after reading the other reviews, but found it poorly written and, like many self-help books, too reliant on made up words such as ""Victim Boxx."" (Why does it have two ""x""s? She never tells us...)There are many stories, or small snippets of stories, from people who have been involved with narcisissists. Although that part was interesting, some of the stories were just too long and bizarre, and all the little snippets were mostly too small to be of interest.I'm glad so many other readers got something out of this book, but I must say that I was very disappointed. I preferred, ""Help, I'm in love with a ..."" because I thought it was written more professionally, and spoke more confidently about how to get out of a relationship with an NPD."
3,"Great display, top cupcake holder didn't fit","I like how this dessert stand looks filled up. It's made out of wires which needed to be adjusted here and there so the cupcakes stay upright. Even then the cupcakes end up standing a bit tilted which makes their top more visible but also something that is not well stuck on your cupcakes may roll down. The stand was hard to lift up when it was fully loaded - it wasn't sturdy enough. The top cupcake holder didn't have the right size opening to screw to the rest, so I couldn't use it at all (the stand looked fine without it). Despite these few imperfections, I find this dessert stand good for its price."
3,cupcake stand,Product functions just fine. I am excited to use it for my daughter's birthday party this month. thanks for the good deal.
2,Incomplete product,Hello this qualifies two stars because it me asked me came I trump troublesome me much that me product me incomplete vendíeran.
4,Gift of Cupcakes,"I wanted to give my sister-in-law a gift of cupcakes in a cupcake stand so I ordered the Wilton one. It came quickly and was as advertised. Although normal cupcakes would work fine in this stand the ones I made in ice cream cone cups didn't work in it. Regardless, she loved it and has two other sizes made by this company. As we visited, she assembled it easily and added it to her collection."
2,Poor Quality,"This is a cheap product, but don't expect it to last more than a few months. I did like the long cord, and the price. The speakers stopped working within 3 months of purchase."
3,This is not a USB headset.,"I have no complaints about this product, but simply wanted to share that this is not a USB headset. It has 3.5mm jacks for the microphone and earpieces. The product description (at least at the time) did not specify the type of connector. I was assuming USB. Again, it probably is a fine headset. I just wanted to write this so someone else would not make the same assumption I did."
1,Not a good buy,When I first tried the mic would pick up everything except my voice. Eventually it finally started working all right.There's a huge static problem with them. When the mic cable is plugged in so much static comes through the earphones. And then turning the mic switch on makes it so much worse. Probably the worst headset I have ever used.
1,Not worth it!,"If you want to save yourself time and money don't take a chance on this headset. I did, and I should have listen to the advice of past buyers. The headset looks nice. Is comfortable, but did not work right out of the box. After spending a large amount of time with out being able to get the mic to work I gave up. I will put it under a lesson learned. Take my advice, save up and get something that has some quality. The old saying ""you get what you pay for"" is true in this case."
2,Great for a While,"This is a really great set if you don't use it that much. This is the second set I've owned, and they've both failed in exactly the same way. I thought the first set deteriorated because of my overuse of the built-in volume/mute control, but this second set has really tanked in exactly the same way. First, the right headphone begins to fail, then the whole thing will alternate between really soft and really loud.However, they are comfortable and great while they last."
2,DOESNT WORK,ok i JUST opened the box read the maual pluged it in DOESNT WORK not worth it i'v downloded everything i needed to and it still just doesnt work
3,Just Alright,"A little uncomfortable, the sound isn't good for gaming so much, but I kind of expected that. The changeable color feature is lame, they include a couple of different cheap plastic pieces to change out for the red which seems pointless to me. Perhaps if they were just headphones that I would wear around town with my Zune, but these are meant for sitting at the computer where I am not looking to make a fashion statement. Overall they do the job, but are cheap.I'd buy them for again if they were $9.99 not $23"
4,Clear and concise,"Clarity of conversation is excellent. Headphones are comfortable yet provide somewhat of a challenge for those of us with smaller heads. However, if you stay positioned and do not make many moves this is not a problem. I would like to see some type of headset adjustment in future models."
1,Cheap product. . .,"Very disappointed in this product. Within 30 days my microphone stopped working for online chat. within another 30 days the sound in the headset portion of this product stopped working on the left earphone. Now at another 30 days I still have to jiggle the wires to make any sound come out of these headsets. This is not the first time I've experienced this with these types of headsets, I've come to believe that they are made to fail within 60-90 days. Can anyone refer a product that works for more than 30 days? Thank you. A very unsatisfied Logitech customer."
4,"Oh, Amazon...","I ordered this, it arrived speedily, it worked for a week, and now the left headphone doesn't work. I ordered this through Amazon.com and so far there has been no response on replacing it..."
2,"Great deal, bad construction","I bought two of these headsets, one for me, one for the hubby. Both have made their way into the trash. The sound is what you would expect but there is a lot of downfalls to this product. First after wearing it for about 30 mins, it starts to indent and hurt the area it sits above your ears. Then the foam covers (ohhh how I hate those) once they fall off, I promise there is no way to easily get them back on without destroying them. Don't let the ability to choose the color on the headset get you too glossy eyed-they are also a pain to get off so if you buy this, choose wisely the first time. Good price, average sound, badddd construction!!!"
2,4 months,4 months after i buyed it the left side stop working ._.............the mic sound goes in a nd outgreat headset for a short priered of time :(
2,"Keywords, Keywords, Keywords","When I type in the keyword ""USB HEADSET""; I expect a group of products that are oh I dunno ... USB HEADSETS. I ordered this because it was well priced and it had good reviews and it came up on the list of USB HEADSETS. Guess what folks, it's mot a USB headset. I read several item descriptions and ultimately made my decision based on the reviews instead of the descriptions. Bad idea. I have wasted $20 since my headset jacks don't f'ing work and I needed something USB compatible. My advice to Amazon is to find a way to seperate your keyword terms so things that people want are not mixed in with a bunch of crap that they don't want. I can hardly blame the seller for this. This is Amazon's keywords not filtering out non-USB headsets and then it's my fault for not SEEING that it wasn't despite the 2 hours I looked through the headsets. I am VERY disappointed."
4,Good for the money,Product was good for the price.Slight discomfort with over-the-ear fitting - but works fine for my needs.
1,Bad packaging,"I bought four of these, it came in crappy packaging. Everything was just thrown into a plastic wrap. It looks used, and the one even has a bend head part."
2,It's Not Bad.,"Sound: Jumping right in, do not expect surround sound quality or anything superb or amazing out of this headset. It is simple stereo sound, and is good for only speaking with friends. Nothing more or less.Comfort: Not comfortable at all. I could only wear it for maybe a half hour without getting sore near around my ears.Mic: This is the saving grace of this headset. The Mic easily picks up on your voice, and I even had to adjust it at times that way I would not be too loud when talking with friends. The mic is very nice.With only the mic being of nice usage on this headset, I would recommend going for something else. The lack of comfort and sound is a bitter annoyance, and only goes to show what cheap products can be sold. I give this product a 2 out of 5."
1,Viewables are NOT Windows 7 Compatible,"A completed Smead Viewables filing system IS fantastically efficient. My gripe is with Smead's present prices for obsolete software products. Buyers beware: 1) Smead's Hanging Folder Software and their File Folder Software are two separate products, each cost about $20 or higher. Neither are Win 7 compatible as of 23 Feb 2010.Why should anyone pay full price for obsolete programs? Seems like questionable business ethics to me.Further, why should one need to buy two separate programs - one for Hanging Files and another for File Folders? Seems stingy, shortsighted thinking to me.One combined FREE download of these obsolete programs would generate continued file & folder product sales to both new users and those existing users who swap PCs (keeping operating systems pre-Windows 7). In fairness, Smead does allow users free downloads of even older versions (IE obsolete) than the Version 4 now on store shelves. SM writing from USA."
3,I purchased better in Boston,"The hoak I purchased from the Wok Shop is ok.It does what one needs it to do, but it's a little on the small side ""for me.""I was able to purchase a larger and better made hoak and chan here in Boston at the Super 88 Asian market !Don't misunderstand me, it works and is made well, but for the $$ I was able to buy one that suited me better.For the casual home cook, I would recomend this.The service from the Wok Shop is excellent!!!!"
3,Not what I expected,"A good book, but it was not what I expected. Only half the book is actual letters. There are very few with responses from Einstein. There are more letters from children than to children."
3,A bit disappointing,"An amusing look at letters Einstein received from children, and some (very few actually) of his responses. I appreciated most the forward from Einstein's granddaughter and those few responses to some letters.I wish there had been more responses included, but realize that would have been difficult to do. In light of that, I wish they had chosen a better title."
2,Tastes Like Sawdust,"Dry and crumbly, not much flavor. Probably good for my health, but will not buy again."
3,Definitely not as good as his Capitol (1980s) CDs.,"After a rather long hiatus from recording, Freddie Jackson returned in 1999 with this new CD. Some of the songs are very satisfying and will bring back memories of his ""Rock Me Tonight"" and ""Just Like The First Time"" albums (when he was truly in peak form as a soul balladeer) but others have a sound and production approach/style that would be (on all counts) more appropriate for the likes of Keith Sweat, Babyface and D'Angelo. If you are a true Freddie Jackson fan, you'll probably want this CD for your library-- just know that it may not be exactly what you'd expect from Freddie."
2,I AM DAVID,"THE MOVIE IS LIKE A GREAT ESCAPE AND A WW2 PRISON CAMP ROLLED INTO ONE ,TOO MANY FLASH BACKS ,NO ONE KNOWN TO BE WAITING UNTIL THE END"
3,I am David,I read the book when I was 12 and it made a huge impression on me. I recently reread the book with my children and we were really excited when we saw that this video was available. We enjoyed the video but was not as impressed as we could have been - acting a bit weak - not a patch on the book - but then that is usually the case when one reads the book first. It still brought a tear to the eye and provides the emotional journey for the viewer that David experiences. This video is only available for Region 1
5,Jerry Lewis delivers in this movie!,"When this movie came out in 1961, Jerry Lewis deliver a humorous look into what really happens in Hollywood. 44 years later it is still relevent today as it was then. Lots of surprises in this movie including the music of Count Basie in the classic boardroom scene with Lewis mouthing off to the music. I enjoyed Lewis' work in this movie!!"
4,Excellent Instructions,"I bought this book particularly for the cover purse and was very pleased to find concise, simple instructions as well as a full size pattern. I made the cover bag and an very happy with the results."
3,The Decorated Bag,"Unfortunately, considering the awesome beaded bag on the cover, the book was disappointing. It's difficult to purchase books online when you can't flip through them. The title is TOO truthful. It's about embellishing bags --not making them, although it redeems itself toward the back with patterns for a few of the basic bags. It does have some good ideas, but there weren't enough to make this book worth it to me.Incidentally, the green beaded bag on the cover is one that has instructions for both the bag and the embellishment."
2,Don't stay in place,"These pads do work just fine, when they actually stay in place. I am constantly finding that the glue or sticky side doesn't have enough stick to keep the pads in place. They often fall out of my pants when walking, leaving me an embarrassing situation to explain. I would stick with the Poise brand that fits and is stays in place."
4,Bladder protection for men,It is comfortable for short time usage. It is not bulky like some of the others. It provides good coverage.
3,used for additional nighttime protection for my special needs son,"I was hoping these pads would help stop the leaks. My son is 7.5 years old and still in diapers as he has Pitt Hopkins Syndrome. We are working on a scheduled potty training, but it is a very slow process. Anyway, these pads didn't really help. In fact, they didn't work as well as the Poise pads we were previously using. So, now we have moved on to the size small adult depends, wrapped over his regular diaper. That worked!!!"
5,Looks real!,I have this behind my computer monitor. People walk by and ask me if it's real all the time!
4,Very Good Product,"The mouse is very good. I mainly bought it for its high dpi. For gaming, it has very good tracking but it is let down by the side buttons and the fact that weights cannot be added."
3,Ummm...Mislabled?,"I'm not sure on this one, but somehow I don't think this is season one of My Little Pony. These were the episodes from 'My Little Pony and Friends' (a series that also featured the Potatoe Head Kids and the Glowfreinds) that came after the movie. I know, or at least seem to recall that there were more episodes that came before, featuring Firefly more often (I recall this because she was my favorite pony as a child). This, and the fact that 'Escape From Katrina' was edited (it's missing the song where she's seen seated on a swing as her partner recalls her kinder years), makes this set a huge disapointment for a fan looking for some nostalgic fun."
5,A great anti-intrusive-government book,I saw this book recommended by a Libertarian. I'm glad I purchased and read it. It brings forth an excellent pro-freedom argument. Get it.
5,everyone in the US should read this book,"This book clearly outlines the proper role of government in our society, and then very eloquently spells out why.This book was written in 1964, way before most people knew anything was wrong with the government becoming involved in every part of our lives. Leonard E. Read was brilliant in his foresight and his ability to communicate in clear concise ways, the things every American should know about freedom. This book is a must read for anyone who loves freedom."
1,Wouldnt play CD was no good,the CD is no good and will not play!!!!!!!!!! it is damaged real bad and will not play!!!!!! you should have said some thing or not put it up for sale
2,See them live instead,"This collective of consummate musicians has as much promise as Phish, but this studio release in particular lacks the spontaneity of their live performance. So much so that even a fan such as myself is disappointed; this CD feels like a poor imitation of Medeski, Martin and Wood. One groovy point (though simplistic) is 100 Year Flood. See them in person or pick up the Live CD."
2,doesn't really catch those pesky nose hairs...,"The concept of this design is that it is suppose to catch nose hair in the grooves and then clip them... But it's really difficult to get your nose hair in the groove if you have pretty straight hair. I experienced it yanking a hair out too not very pleasant, and I found myself clipping a lot more than with regular safety nose scissors.You're better off using a regular pair of nose hair scissors."
3,Shipping was quick flash,"Having installed the brakes yet. But, the shipping was ridiculously super quick. Purchased it on a friday @ about 2 pm, and it arrived at my house 11:30 am Saturday."
3,muy completo pero necesita update,Tiende definitivamente todo para organizar tu boda con lujo de detalles. lo unico que deben ofrecer versiones actualizadas. Pero en realidad tiene muchos detalles que podrian olvidarse su uno mismo desea organizar su boda e incluso te ofrece ideas. Supe de el pq mi madre tenia guardado uno.
2,A Waste of Time and Money,"In addition to being incredibly ""buggy"" (my game freezes up on me occasionally and I've had trouble loading), this game is pathetic. The gameplay is particularly tiresome, given that you need to swing at the ball pretty much as soon as it leaves the pitcher's hand if you want to make any real contact. In addition, the graphics are mediocre. I can't understand how anyone could say that this game is ""great"" or even ""passable."" I feel like I got completely ripped off."
3,Riu Chiu Found!,"Buy this for ""Riu Chiu"", a great Spanish song that was featured on the Monkees' Christmas episode. It also has ""All The King's Horses"" a good little rockin' tune that I believe was never released as a single, even though it was played on the show (the episode where a kid leaves Davy a horse to take care of). The version of ""Words"" on here has a backwards part on it, believed to be one of the first time that effect was used on a song. The version of ""I'll Be Back Up On My Feet"" is different from the one used on the show."
5,Monkee Men,"I bought this CD for the song Riu Chiu. Not only is that song beautiful, but the rest of the CD is equally terrific. There were songs I had never heard before. This original boy band is still the best. Would definitely recommend for your collection."
3,It could have been so much more....,"This could have been a terrific movie if only the story had more to bite into. I found the final scenes - where all of the electricity goes out, were about the most profound. I've been a fan of Keanu Reeves but losing respect for his acting abilities. He plays pretty much the same character he always plays - serious, deep, all-knowing and unmoved. Surely he can do something more challenging with his career!"
1,The Day the Earth Stood Still,"Keanu Reeves' acting is wooden, the story is not nearly as coherent as the 50's original. I felt no sympathy for the characters or any sense that Klatu was on a benevolent mission. If it weren't for the inclusion of that excellent original, I would have considered this DVD a waste of my money. I recently saw 'Knowing' and found that one much more worthwhile."
3,I'm glad I waited,"I was dying to see this movie when it was in the theater, but I'm glad I didn't waste my money! Instead I spent a buck, outside a supermarket, rental machine and found the movie to be nothing like the original, which I saw and still have in my posession. Will Smith's son's character is nothing like the kid who played in the original, who I think did a much better job. It made no sense to me. Hey! Don't take my advice, watch it! You can get it for a buck now, in rentals outside of most supermarkets."
1,When particle systems attack,"Spoiler alert.When bad acting, bad writing and a giant particle system conspire with obvious product placement to annihilate the human race, our fate hangs in the balance. Don't worry, our love of family will save the day."
1,The Day the Earth Stood Still 2 disc set,"I won't repeat what the other reviewers said, just to say that when I opened the DVD, immediately I discovered that they cheapened the case by punching big holes in it to save costs. Looks like they saved about a nickles worth of plastic for every fifty they produced! So then I played it and to fall asleep shortly after the 1928 opening scene...literally. My wife suffered through it and suggested that we should have rented it instead! I saw it a second time with several cups of coffee, and tend to agree with her. The trailer was much more interesting than the movie! I hope Keanu Reeves and Jennifer Connelly won't waste their skills with this director again, and I'm glad the studios gave us the original classic movie, which was great, to make me feel that I totally didn't waste my money! With a story line like this, it could have been much better!"
2,Incomplete script,"I bought the DVD thinking it was going to be good. Interesting effects of course but shallow characters, bland acting, and it felt as it the story needed so much more. Ending wasn't satisfying."
1,Worst movie of this millenium,"Reeves flat affect was not the problem..he was ok. Jaden Smith should have been blown to smithereens by Gort...I would have given 4 stars to see this alone...he is the most annoying kid actor ever. Hmmm , I wonder how he got the gig . The story was terrible and totally unfaithful to the original..which is one of the best sci-fi movies ever. The biggest letdown of the Century. Deserves a ZERO."
2,Not as good as I hoped!,"I watched this DVD yesterday and was highly disappointed! It was poorly acted and nothing seemed very realistic at all!! The special effects we okay, but not as cool as the previews made them out to be. The story had many holes and I'm normally not one to focus on that type of stuff. I like to take a movie at face value and just enjoy it, but I had a tough time doing that with this one. I kept saying to myself ""People wouldn't react that way"".All in all I was very disappointed and happy that I didn't waste my money to see it in the theatre!"
1,Lame remake,"It really doesn't get worse than this. Nothing like the original. The movie drags, the characters are boring, the needy child sub plot grates on your nervous and Reeves is terrible. He walks around a lot in a suite. That's his part in the movie. Just skip it all together. Watch the original. BnB Beatles Depot"
1,Horrible(It Says It All),"I,ll just tell you one word Horrible,buy the old edition even at [...] this updated version stinks.Reeves better retire as his movie days are over,The boyish charm that elivated him in past films cant save him anymore."
1,"this is so bad, it's keanu reeves bad","if ''anything is possible'' and seeing how this waste of film made it into theatres proves the saying is correct, is it possible to give this negative stars? a movie about characters who are ''alien''to good acting, just all around dumb movie, how does ''KR'' continue to make a living?"
5,...Because I love the original,"The film wasn't that bad. It started off very promising. The first hour was suspenseful, and I had great hopes for this film. After the 60 minute mark, I felt there were scenes that were unfinished, or didn't make sense, for example, after Klaatu escapes, the alarms are wailing, red lights are flashing, the secret facility where the alien-visitor was held goes to lock down mode, Jennifer Connelly is in the lab...then suddenly, she's at home cooking dinner. Huh? They let her go home during an emergency? So many promising scenes just fell flat: the visit with Dr Barnard, Gort the Robot, the ending felt rushed, and not well-thought out. But I can't bring myself to give it only one or two stars. Maybe cause I love the original so much, it would be like slapping an unwanted step-child in the face to pan the re-make. I dunno, I can't explain it, so I'm giving it 5 stars, because I wanted it to be a 5 star film. *sigh*"
1,Worst movie ever!!!!!!,"I had the misfortune to waste almost 2 hours of my life due to this movie. The whole plot is LITERALLY unfolded in the first 3-5 minutes. The special effects were very chinsy not to mention that you shouldn't be surprised if don't see any nominations for acting in this crappy remake. Everything about this movie sucked and if I weren't with the family I would of asked for a refund, in fact this is actually one of those movies where after watching it you feel pissed for wasting ten dollars on crap. When Keanu spoke chinese with his surfer-bro accent I busted up laughing because it was so lame. So to get to the point of the review, I wouldn't even recommend this to rent because it was so bad. I like sci-fi but not this."
1,Day the plot stood still,"It's always dangerous when someone sees a need to re-make an icon like this one, and this attempt is a good example why. The message is muddled, the acting is robotic, and the effects are (yawn) nothing special. I watched the original version again after seeing this film, and confirmed that this new version is a change I cannot live with."
2,More Hollywood Drival,"Im not sure of the message in this movie only that man was at the brink of world destruction. Was it war, famine or the dreaded global warming? I was enjoying the film until the propaganda began (first 20 min. or so was cool). I was truly expecting Al Gore to be the scientist that helped the alien decide how to show mankind his power. Once again hollywood shows not only how it is incapable at creation but can also destroy a classic with its frail attempt at remakes."
3,This movie could have been a big big hit....but did'nt .....,"When you make a remake and you have a big budget, most of the time itwill be equal or better than the original. They had the chance in thisone..and almost made it.What kind of producers /director/budget maker made the decision to basethe whose success of the movie on the emotional final scenes that really did not work well...i really did'nt believe the emotions that were getting portrayed on screen by the kid at all..in fact i found him annoying and not believable...What a bunch of turkeys...and who made the decision to not have a great ending with special effects that blows your mind as the earth is saved and lots of things should have happen and did'nt....poof !!! its over...thanks for your admission...I still like the movie for what it is.. ill keep it with the original."
2,"Humanity is bad, but....","After the universal disdain for this film, I wasn't going to buy it. My wife hates most Sci-Fi, and this was purported to be not good sci-fi, so wisely picking my movie battles, I was going to skip it. However, my sweet-heart decided to surprise me (it's the thought that counts) and we sat down and watched the DVD together.Here is the short version,People are bad.People are self destructive.People need to be destroyed.People made classical music.People love.People can learn.People need to be saved.So overall, political diatribe aside, it wasn't terrible all the way through, just really terrible in parts, and the rest was watch-able, but the bad parts are really and truly bad.On the plus side the CGI was quite good, but again the script was atrocious.2*"
4,GOOD PRICE FOR 2 BLURAY + 1 PC MOVIE,"I bought this bluray because it was a 3-disc special edition. I could see the movie in blue ray, and the original movie (1951) too, just for $ 9,99"
1,Get the Blu-ray of the 1951 original only....,...which actually costs more but is worth it because it is not contaminated by sharing a package with the 2008 garbage.My rule: Never spend a nickel on a remake of a classic until you've seen it on TV -- which is why I've never spent a nickel on any of them.
1,"Hollyweird should stop calling these ""remakes"" of classic movies, because","they really aren't.They are huge stinkers. Just call it another name, they don't have to pretend it will be as good as the original. The title for this could have been Gort, Keanu barrada nikto. So, if anyone has seen and appreciated the original will know what that means. Will hollyweird ever realize ya can't repeat the same success with a classic movie by ""Updating"" it. Because, when you ""update"" the whole story line is changed and therefore it is no longer the ""same"" story line. Ok, Keanu isn't much of an ""actor"" anyway, and is that the woman Ben Aflack is married to? He's prettier than her, and that annoying kid, was that one of Will Smith's offspring? High tech, CGI and lots of noise, does not make up for a bad script and bad acting."
3,Aliens came to earth...,"...and brought us Keanu Reeves. We should have known right then there'd be trouble.Like all the other reviewers, I have to comment on the special effects of the movie. I thought they were pretty impressive, but strip them away and you aren't really left with anything.Keanu is his usual drab dry self. Nothing new there.The overall ""save the world"" theme becomes a bit preachy after awhile. There's even a cool scene where a trucker and his cab are consumed by the alien with huge smoke stacks in the background filling the air with pollution. I half expected to see Al Gore make a guest appearance.On top of this, we have a female protagonist with a stubborn black stepson (Jurassic Park II, anyone?) in tow, and she's supposed to convince Keanu to call it off. ""We can change!""Lots of lose scenes tied together, probably due to poor editing. Lots of big special effects, as I already stated. And lots of let down. Skip this one and see the original instead."
1,The Day I soiled Myself,Keanu Reeves is so horrid an actor that I become angry when I see him. Who allows him to coninue to make films? He can continue to act long after his death as no one would be able to tell the difference.
1,what a bore !!!,Buy the original with Michael Rennie. Keanu Reeves and the kid are so miscast.Jennifer Connely is only forgiven as she is such a beauty.Her first movie with Dario Argento was her shining moment.This was such a bad idea and the studio's think FX will save bad acting and mundane scripting ??? I wouldn't pay a penny and sit through this turkey again :(
2,Very Disappointing remake of a classic.,"We looked forward to seeing this movie as we had seen the original many times. However, we were very disappointed in this rather stupid remake. The movie is in many ways illogical as a science fiction movie, poor as a drama and lacks any kind of credibility. A giant space ship lands and soldiers show up with guns? Ridiculous. It made sense in the original but in this day it makes no sense. I have been trying to think of any good points but cannot come with any. The movie has a few special effects but not much else. I'm just glad we didn't waste more money by seeing in a theater."
1,They spent all the money on ten minutes of FX...,"This is one of the most insanely dissapointing movies I've seen in a very long time. The original movie was excellent, this remake is a full-scale train wreck. Watching the extra features, you realize why it's a train wreck - the people making it were so obsessed with special effects they forgot what the movie was about or even how to do it. It turns into an extremely boring eco-preaching flick and just stays there.There's about ten minutes of impressive special effects toward the end, but that's the only bright spot in this otherwise entirely dismal movie. An absolute waste of time and money, both for those who made it, and for anybody who wastes two hours sitting through it. This is a serious stinker."
1,What a War!,The only disaster here is this film!It did have ok special effects and a cast that deserved better; but the screenplay was simply bad. There was no development of story or character. Few remakes have failed as badly as this one; forget this movie and buy the original. That is a good movie!I only give it one star because there is no lower rating!
4,Includes Original 1951 B&W Version?,"FYI, Unless I'm mistaken, this 3 disk Blu-ray version should also include the entire B&W; 1951 version (also on BD) that I hear looks rather stunning in HD.http://www.thehdroom.com/news/The_Day_the_Earth_Stood_Still_Remake_on_Blu-ray_in_April/4248"
2,A bit too out there for me,"I am a person who prefers REAL LIFE type of movies, books, and shows. This movie definitely held my interest but it was a bit too out there for my tastes."
2,Missing pockets,"I received this item and was immediately disappointed to see that there were NOT ""12 shoe-sized"" pockets on the back as the product description specifically said. The only extra pockets are the three on each side (and nothing on the back), which is ok, but not nearly what I was expecting. Furthermore, each individual shelf is not lined with some hard cardboard/plastic bottom so they collapse inward when you put anything in them. I suppose for such a cheap price this item is not a bad deal, but I was expecting much more - especially given the other good reviews. I am sending this product back asap."
2,So Bummed.... Quality Control Issue,"What I loved about this organizer is its usefulness. But unfortunately mine came with the cloth piece for ""Thursday"" sewed on backwards. I am disappointed in the Quality Controls of the manufacturer. I am sending it back."
5,Makes Organization Easy!!!,This is an awesome product for children who like to pick out their own clothes. My son and I put his clothes in each slot on Sunday night so there isn't any drama in the morning over what he's going to wear. The pockets on the side are great for belts and such too.
3,Great,"I really love these! They are wonderful, I was a little upset at first because the reviews I read stated there was also pockets on the back in addition to the sides, and there were none on the back, but the shelves and pockets on side were plenty! Great idea and makes picking out clothes easy and fun for the kids!"
5,Italian charm,"This was a X-Mass gift for a started bracelet for my daughter. We have two chocolate labs and I thought that this would symbolize's her love for them. The product is well made, and loops on to the existing bracelet."
4,Good resource,"Personally, I found the historical aspect of this book the most appealing. The actual ""how to"" part of the book could easily be made into a seperate book itself. Great information, and I respect Mr. Rudlin. I've read most everything he's written and have thoroughly enjoyed learned about this wonderful art."
3,An excellent book for some peolple,"It is a really interesting book but I wouldn't recommend it to all the people I know!! It's subject involves three elements: 1. Historical information on Ancient Greek philosopher's like Socrates, Aristotle and mostly Plato 2. Philosophical views on subjects like life after death, science and religion, homosexuality, ways of teaching and others... 3. A novel represented by an average quality story but with some strong good characters. Generally the book is about a not written dogma supposed to be presented in ancient Greek by Plato...is this true?? why many writers and authors die after finishing their project on this not written dogma?? what does it concern?? can the main characters find that in the end??Ty reading it if you enjoy philosophical discussions and for your sake do not look at the end of the book!! You will ruin everything with the least being your fun with this book."
3,A good book about life not poker,If you are looking for a book to improve your poker game...this is not it. If you are looking to understand life as a whole...this may be it.
5,Pony Love,"My 4 year old loves this pony. The carrier is a great touch, since that's the preferred method in our house to carry our 'babies'. The kicking legs is adorable, and she just loves the way it calls her Mommy. She won't go any where without her Skywishes, and plays with her for hours. I only wish that they would make the same thing with the Dragon friend for my son, since at 2 he's just as enamored with a moving talking pony."
4,my daughter loved it!!,my daughter went through her pony phase and loved this toy. She could wear it in her back pack... and when her little brother came along she was able to play with it on the mat like her baby brother did. Loved it! and loved that it moves and talks
4,Pretty Nice,The quality seems to be good. I wish it fit in between the two front seats of my minivan... but it works out pretty well otherwise.
5,Excellent book,"This book was an excellent guide to trying to teach children to change from their hearts. The heart is the seat of emotions and will, and the place where behavior starts. The only lasting change in our children's behavior will come from changing their hearts and not just stopping bad behavior. This book was an easy read and gave many practical examples of how to implement the strategies they suggest. It is similar to Shepherding a Child's Heart by Tedd Tripp, but it is more readable and practical."
4,Pretty good animation!,"This is really good quality animation, my kids love to watch this on the big screen even my husband. However even though i had the Towel of Babel 3 dvd's box that had Genesis and Noah's ark and even the brothers in war so after this i thought the next DVD box serie (GENESIS) supposed to have what the other one do not have so i ordered the other one and plus the Rain of Fire one so now i have two Rain of Fires and two Genesis and brothers at war and Noah's ark....The animation is good but there is no new testament even though i believe in not making the image of God or the Son of God, they should make New Testament ones with our Savior's face as light(like they did God's image/voice as a light after Cain killed his brother) and make the rest of NT and more OT then i highly would buy it to be honest even though i was complaining about the price before i'm happy with my purchases now:)!!!"
1,A Joyless Experience,"I bought this video for our 15-month old. He is moderately interested in it for about five minutes at a time. I on the other hand find it positively creepy. The repetitive chanting of the children's voices and the claustraphobic computer-generated imagery seem intended to put a child into a trance-like state. Well, at least that's the effect it has on me. There is none of the joy of visual experience so evident in the Baby Mozart series. Miracle of Mozart, ""Numbers and Shapes"" has nothing extraneous, nothing present simply for the delight of the eye. It's geared exclusively to stuffing numbers and shapes into the baby's head. I find this single-mindedness quite disturbing for a tape geared to infants. Is early success so important that we have to sacrifice fun ? Incidentally, it is extremely hard to imagine any child over 2 sitting through this video, even though the age range is 8 months to 5 years."
4,Gamers ed!,"No doubt that this game rocks. There are a couple of problems however. Unlike the metal slug games, not so hardcore fighting fans will not enjoy this game as much. Its a great game for fighting game fans but other players may not find it as great."
4,ARCHER'S ARCH ARMCHAIR,"This is another excellent offering from Art Asylum. Although it isn't exactly ""fun"" due to its fairly static nature, it IS an outstanding replica of Capt. Archer's command chair. I just wished that the displays would have lighted to really bring this set piece to life."
3,Nice - but not so good,It will help you asemble your puzzles but it is not so good as it seems . Basically rolling in and out dependes in a cardbox tube that comes with it and it is not so good to do it. go for another option.
1,puzzle roll up,Too bad I spent $15 on something that probably cost $2 to put together. I need to be more creative in my thinking.
2,Puzzle Rollup mat,"I thought the felt piece was a terrific way to keep the puzzle parts isolated and organized. But, the puzzle purists in the family thought the felt mat made grasping the pieces very difficult and frustrating. The purists have resorted to a piece of plexiglass rather than the puzzle roll-up mat as their favored surface."
3,Puzzle roll up mat,It's not really what I expected. thinner material then it should be. Does what it says it will do. But don't expect it to be totally together.
2,Poor choice,The camera never worked. It would have been too much trouble and too expensive to return the cheap product. Save your money!
2,not stain proof as advertised,"I have the one from Lifetime and my kid cannot draw on it with a pen. This table, on the other hand, is different. My kid drew all over it already."
2,Discription of holocost... hollow,"Eve Bunting is fabulous author and I admire her work.. but she relate's rabbits and frogs to the holocost, really, think about this for a moment, can rabbits and frogs REALLY teach kids about went on during the holocost, the most aful thing that has happened, I think, cannot be put into words. But I'm older than the preferred reading level for this so maybe they are to young to know what really went on. Younger kids might rate this differently, butg as a 12 year old, I'm sticking to this."
5,wow! this is a hidden treasure!,"i buy and listen to a lot of music and rarely am this impressed. There is so much wonderful feeling and music in this cd: great voices, creative instrumentation, variety, fun, intriguing lyrics. i am very excited about this cd. it is good to listen to in the car and at home. the music reminds me of the spark of genius you hear when you listen to pink floyd or the beatles, but with the intimacy of a singer-songwriter. This has both depth and wit! There are no lulls or songs you want to skip over---it's good from beginning to end. Very good!"
1,it was too complicated,"the book is way too complicated and the storyline is uninteresting. i don't know about reading that book, i believe The Giver written by Lois Lowry is a much better book, with a touching storyline. Read on Book Worms!! ^^~"
5,An Awesome book; needs a sequel,"Abhorsen was an excellent read that i would recommend to anyone. Like its predecessors, it is ""dark fantasy"" (which makes them so good) and is one of the top books that i have read. The only bad thing about it is that it's ending is so vague, it leaves the reader thirsting for another novel (which is probably Nix's intention). I really hope that we will get a new book in the future, for goodness knows we need one."
3,Somewhat disappointing...,"Abhorsen is a good book to read if you have read the other 2 in the trilogy, however I wouldn't say it was the best book of the 3. There are lot's of bits and pieces that need to be sorted out. Lot's of questions remained un-answered. That is primarily why I didn't enjoy this book as much as I wish I had. It is truly disappointing how you are left hanging there. I have read other books that have left you somewhat hanging there, but this... there has to be more! Hopefully the Sinopsis above is correct and that Mr. Nix really DOES have some more ""tricks up his sleeve"". Although my review isn't very cheerful, I would definately recommend this book to anyone who has started the series!"
5,Abhorsen in all the Mysteries it holds,This is a book that you can not put down from the start. There is the Mystery that was in Liael in this book too. The world is in more danger every second. They have a great evil from the beginning of time that must be defeated. A friend to save. They think they lost Mogget.

4,vol 7 gets 4 stars,"The music in thuis Cd is from 1971 (4 songs) and 1972 (8 songs). Out of the 12 songs on the CD I realy like only 5 of them, 3 are OK and the other 4 could have been replaced with bigger hits or more known hits. I consider myself a 60's and 70's music guru and the 4 song that I refer to above are very obscure artist, not that thier songs are not good, just didn't get much airplay.Luckily the great songs outweight the obscure ones, hence the 4 stars"
1,Does not lay flat against seat.,"I bought two of these and was really looking forward to corralling all of the books and toys that my children bring into the car. The photo on the box shows the organizer laying flat against the seat. When I put the organizer on my seat, it flapped out so that it almost reached the edge of my child's seat. There is a black cord that came in the box but there are no instructions on what to do with it. I'm assuming that it is to tie the organizer to the seat but it won't fit around my seat plus I don't want an ugly black corder going around my seats!I will be returning both of these and am frustrated with the time wasted."
4,bodylastic,"I was impressed with the sturdiness and construction of this equipment, and also in the variety of ways it can be utilzed during a workout. The handgrips are very comfortable during use. The set comes in a little bag to make it extremely portable. The only drawback is that I normally work out with a friend, and the kit only includes one set of grips/handles, though I believe you can order an additional set of handles without ordering another complete set."
3,mixed but positive,"I am a life long free weight guy. I would stick them it but time and money are an issue now. Bodylastics seemed like a good solution. For the most part, I like them.1. relatively inexpensive (compared to bowflex or total gym)2. takes up no space and is portable.3. good work out.What I don't like so much about it is that it just feels weird. it takes a while to get used to.The WORST part is that I can't figure out how to recreate the classic bench press. I can use the door attachment, but as i add ""weight"" I keep getting pushed into the door backwards. they need to sell a bench or some attachment that can go on a bench for advanced resistance. perhaps a swiss ball.they also need to sell a straight bar attachment, like versa stick"
1,Good at first,These band were great when I first got them but over less than a year many of the bands began to break. Its great that they offer a lifetime warranty but I would rather just have something that isn't actually going to break and be dependable over a decent period of time. While the warranty is good they do charge $6-9 for each broken piece. So not really a true warranty in that sense. Was disappointed in this purchase.
3,"A long, bumpy ride with a few fun stops.","The girl-fearing Jerry finds himself employed in an enormous boarding house for...ladies. A great concept in a great space - a huge original set; plus magnificent cameos by Buddy Lester, George Raft, and Harry James. The disappointment is in the underuse of Opera star Helen Traubel and in alot of protracted, unfunny mugging - the scene involving a live television interview with Helen at her house should have been hilarious but somehow misses the mark. Students of film comedy can still marvel at Lewis' incredible timing, however."
4,the ladies man,"Another Jerry Lewis favoriate. If you love comedy and Jerry Lewis this is another one of his best movies to add to your collection. He swears off women because of a broken engagement and goes off to find a job. He finds a job surounded by women not realizing it until he accepts the position,and they will not let him go."
4,"Could have been better, but very good!",Where is Silver Lining??? Overall a solid Best Of.... The new previously unreleased songs are GREAT!!!!!
4,Enterprise - New manufacturer,"I have weapons make by the prior franchise, which I thought were great quality. This the 1st ship that I have purchased and I love it. I'm enjoying the detail and sound effects. I already have it strung up in my office. I am purchasing 2 more for collector purposes. I didnt rate the durability of this item because I havent tested it."
2,"Not ""Pronouced Perfectly in Italian""","Professor Danesi is knowledgeable about his subject, Italian. It just doesn't come through in this book. Perhaps it was one of the first books he wrote and he hadn't gotten the hang of it but it lacks the clarity and explanatory power of his later books. I have three of his books and this is by far the least helpful. I started his work when I could barely say a word in Italian. I can now say a lot more, and his work is still helpful, just not this book."
