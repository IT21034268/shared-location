2,Typical Updike,"Updike can write splendidly. However, he cannot be compared favorably to even good past or great contemporary authors. In this book Updike is more of the same labored almost beautiful writing. I found Trust Me to be much of the same. For a good short story look elsewhere. However if you are interested in Updike read his earlier books. It seems that as his career lengthened he changed his writing to try and leave a more refined and antiseptic waft in the readers mind, perhaps he had thoughts of stuffy British grandeur."
1,"Nice unit, until it fails, and that wont take long.","The CanoScan LiDE 600F worked great for about a month, then the mechanism began to jerk and blur the image. Amazon replaced it, and the new one failed in about a month, with the mechanism frozen in the park position. Now I had to deal with Canon tech support. (and yes, for the idiots at Canan Tech Support, the shipping lock was unlocked.) The third unit arrived DOA.What happened? Canon used to be a name you could trust"
3,A nice moisturizer,A decent moisturizer but not too moisturizing.Wouldn't recommend for people with dry skin.
3,The thing about short stories...,"is that if you don't like the one you're reading, you'll be on the next one in a couple pages.When I first heard about this book on NPR a couple of years ago, I was so excited about it. For some reason, the idea of the PA coal town really intrigued me. But I'm really glad I ended up getting it used from the Book Barn for $4 rather than springing for the hardcover for $25. It's actually a collection of short stories, not one continuous novel, but most of the stories deal with the same families. It was pretty good, but not wonderful. The good thing about the short story concept is that if you don't like what you're reading, it's over in a few pages. Some of the stories were better than others. I say that you should get it from the library, read a couple stories, and see if you can get into it."
5,Dead Head's movie,We watched this and thought it was great to see all the dead head's from back in the day jamming out. Really cool.
3,Much more available footage that wasn't given to us....,"According to the archiver and producer of these DVDs, they filmed at least 3 angles of the band playing from ALL of these shows. Meaning we got maybe 1/2 of what was available. Not only that, they could have included full versions of the songs from the movie without the over-exposed crowd scenes, but they chose not to do this. It's still a great set, but it could have been so much more."
5,nothing else like it,"You can't find better footage of the Dead. If you loved the Dead in the 70's you will love these dvd's. The horrible video I've seen of post 1980 Dead just makes me cringe. This is before Jerry's decline when he was truly one of the best musicians to ever grace a stage.It's far out, man."
1,Disappointed,I wanted to see a DVD of Dead songs like a concert.It is strictly BS about the Dead and it was bad BS. At that. Someone is ripping off the Dead and they did it thru me.Boomshakalaka a pox on ye bad dudes.
1,This not the band from the USA!,"This is the apparently legendary 1960's band from the Netherlands. I have not heard this release (the 1 star ""rating"" is due to it being a required field) but it is definitely not the band as described in the editorial review. Based on that site this does appear to be a comprehensive compilation of that band's work."
5,Couldn't put it down!,"This book outlines what a parent suffers though when their child makes poor choice after poor choice. I am one of those parents, and Mr. Stowers nails it. This is a page turner even if you have no children. It helped me to know I'm not alone when a beloved son loses his way in life."
5,Really Jazzy Pots,"I love it, so It was surprise, because I live in Brasil and I received the purchase just one week! It helped me so much to create my decorating pots."
5,Great Historic Overview,"This books gives a great overview of Himalayan exploration, cultural aspects, and an understanding of the tribes of the region. Reading about explorers being thrown into a pit of tigers amongst other weirdness is quite entertaining. A nice selection of historic photos also accompanies the text. Recommended if you have a library of books on this region. I bought this book over 20 years ago and would never loan it out to anybody."
3,Cute and entertaining but doesn't work as intended,"My kitty plays with this toy a lot, mostly batting it around on the floor. I don't know if she's just too dumb to figure out the toy or if this is a universal problem, but she's never been able to get the treats out of the pocket. I tried using soft treats and hard treats, breaking them up, everything. She just doesn't get it. But she still likes it."
3,Good concept - Not robust enough.,"Bought this for a food motivated cat - he went at it right away. I put regular food in, he started chewing it like mad, and within 15 minutes already started shredding the netting. He was not motivated to ""play"", he just chewed. I guess I wasn't expecting more, I just was expecting the netting to be a bit more strong."
1,Look around first!,This reader is included with a number of SD cards for free. Look around at different options before dropping money on something so simple.
5,Perfect for quick transfer of photos,"We use this with our Apple Macs and it is small,convenient and easy to use."
5,The NEW Maggie Bell,"Do you remember Maggie Bell? She was one of the best female rock singers of the 70's. Well if you do remember her, and enjoyed her, you will LOVE Never the Bride. If you never heard of Maggie Bell, still give Never the Bride a chance, I promise, you WILL NOT be dissapointed. The powerful vocals of Nikki Lamborn will leave you wanting more. Songs to lisiten to first "" This is a Cry For Love"", ""2Into 1"", and ""3 Good Reasons"". But don't stop there. Give the whole disc a lisiten to. Then lisiten to the rest of their catalogue. You will become a fan."
3,Munsingwear Men's Big Man 2-Pack Full-Rise Pouch Brief review,"Unlike other reviews about these briefs, I find their build quality to be quite acceptable. The problem that I had with them is that being a big man, (I wear size 46), they are way too short for me, making the elastic band miss my waist by almost an inch, front and back. I wish they make a ""Tall"" version of them like Jockey's Tall briefs. Other than that, the pouch system is very comfortable and fits perfectly. Would recommend if you wear regular sizes."
3,Briefs,"The briefs are okay. I usually buy a larger size for my legs, but these were larger than the other brand I buy. I am trying to shrink them."
4,Good but Bad,"This is a good product I used it all the time before the heater went out. That was about one week after I received it. I had to go out and buy more bags I used it so much. So I sent it back to Amazon and they sent me a new one. I used the new one, one time and after that the heating element went out again. So I'm on my third one. I have to say Amazon's return online is fast and easy. I would recommend this product."
4,Special,"Set some time aside in your busy schedule and delve into the irresistable world or cheesy-techno-pop. This time it is remixed, and although every song is notn a 10/10, the entire effort of ""Happy end of You"" comes in somewhere around 9/10, for me of course. Some real sonic gems here. Quite an aural treat to jaded ears, but hey, it's the Pizzicato Five."
5,The most comprehensive book on the process of enlightenment,"I have read all of the books written by Kryon and Lee Carroll and have found that this one book summarizes everything I have ever read on the topics of spiritual growth and enlightenment. It is a book I give freely to people who cross my path because I think it offers the purest message on God and the meaning of life on this planet. Kryon goes, step-by-step, through the process we all need to take to find our true sense of Joy on this planet. It is though-provoking, funny, and incredibly uplifting. It shows that everything we do, that everything we experience has value in the eyes of God and the Universe. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is seeking to find their own sense of the Truth."
3,Quick Recipes - Difficult Ingredients,"I do give the cook book credit for quick recipes. However, the ingredients aren't things that you would commonly have on hand, which to me makes more preperation time, effort and money. I would have also liked to have seen more pictures. I actually was going to return the book, but it wasn't cost effective and I will use it for some of the recipes."
2,WW,Was delivered in a timely manner but wasn't thrilled with the book. Too many recipes called for products i don't buy. I am all about quick and easy. Not a gourmet cook.
2,"Good recipes, no serving sizes","Cookbook is great as far as healthy and yummy looking recipes. Points are great BUT book lists no serving sizes. Like doesn't say 1 C, 4 ounces, so to me cookbook is useless."
1,Waste of money,"Terrible purchase. Laggy rendering speed (think Powerpoint), horrible interface, boring concept. There's more fun in open-source and you don't have to put up with EA doing the DRM thing. Talk about not being able to take a clue from their customer base. Sheesh. gg EA."
1,Horrible,"Beyond using the horrible securom antitheft protection, the game is just god-awful boring. It's a collection of pitiable minigames that would make the worst the wii has to offer blush. You'll be sick of it in 2 hours."
1,Can only install 3 times,"I was very much looking forward to this game, but the pathetic DRM on the game has turned me away. If you buy Spore, you have to ""activate"" it with an internet connection. That's maybe fine, but the problem is you only get three activations, ever. If your hard drive crashes, or you upgrade your computer, or something goes wrong with the activation, or even if you upgrade only part of your computer; bam, you need to reactivate. Do it enough, and you won't be able to play the game without calling EA's 1-800 number.Do we really want to live in a world where every time we upgrade our computer, we have to spend hours on hold calling up dozens of different companies to get our software reactivated? Because that's where this is heading. Tell EA you won't put up with product activation by voting with your $$$. Don't buy Spore."
1,Broken Activation,"The game looks promising, which is why it's the first game I've bought in over two years, but it won't install due to the broken activation. Calling EA support this morning was useless. I'm going to try to return it, but I doubt that will be successful so I probably just got ripped off for $60 by EA."
1,"DRM Punishes Legitimate Users, Not Pirates","I really hope the flood of poor reviews has an impact on sales of this game. I have been looking forward to Spore for years, but now can't in all conscience purchase it due to the ridiculous DRM scheme imposed by EA.The greed and disregard for their legitimate customers shown by this move should not be rewarded: Don't buy this game until EA removes the SecuROM DRM."
1,A rental...,"There really isn't much to say here. The DRM is terrible -- three strikes and your out (that's three installs). I guess they don't want any of us playing this game in a few years. I only keep a game that I am actively playing on my computer, I guess if I wanted Spore, I'd have to keep it on there indefinitely."
1,DRM Ruins everything - Avoid!,"Three Installs. Hardware failure, new computer, need to reinstall the OS, and it still counts toward your limit. After that point, you have to call up and beg EA to allow you to keep using the game you just spent $50 for. What do you bet in a few years EA will simply shut down the activation server altogether, rendering your game completely useless (This has already happened with the Microsoft and Gooogle DRM music/video services). As others have noted, this is simply an expensive RENTAL, and you may find yourself unable to use your game at any time."
1,Almost bought the game...,I was even going to run it on a computer that I could sacrafice to the DRM scheme. I then decided not to support EA and their DRM friends. It's best not to reward them. The single license thing sucks too.
1,Horrible Idea,"Why oh why would you limit the installs to 3? I was all set to purchase this game, after eagerly awaiting it for the past few years, and then read that. I reinstall my OS at least 3-4 times a year for various reasons, so that would mean I would be able to play the game for a year. After which if I begged you enough, and provided enough proof to your liking, I might be able to install it one more time?! Not a chance you will be getting my money for this one now, which is a complete shame since this game looks so amazing. Stop treating your paying customers as if they were criminals and I guarantee you will sell more games. Like others have already stated, right now you are essentially forcing people to pirate it. I am fortunate I read about this mess before I purchased a copy. I feel sorry for the unlucky person who gets it home and then realizes what a mess they have on their hands."
1,bleh - EA games is becoming more evil by the minute,"way to blow this one for your legitimate customers EA... considering this game was cracked and available on the interwebs days before it was even released in stores, this DRM of yours has really paid off..."
2,Clearly not finished.,"After just a couple hours a play, it's plainly obvious this game is not finished. From creature design, to fighting, to city management, everything is simple. There are very few different ways to do things.It's amazingly inane. This could have been a game marketed to ten year olds, who might find it engaging. It is not the complex, creature-building game it was touted to be.I would not recommend anyone waste their money on it. Read the reviews on other sites first. There simply isn't much to the game."
1,Boring,Spore is shallow and boring after the first 5 minutes. The DRM is crippling. Save your money. What a waste.
1,Great game dissapointingly crippled by DRM,"Spore is a fantastic game. You may only get 10-20 hours of gameplay out of it if you call yourself a 'gamer' but for anyone with even a casual interest in games, its well worth the $50. the gameplay is fantastic.The problem is that you are treated like a criminal for buying this game. You are allowed *one* login per cd-key. and once the game has been reinstalled 3 times. you have to call and plead to EA that you arent a criminal. Its a shame that they chose to use the invasive securrom copy protection. The fact is, the protection was removed a week before spore came out by random internet people. You can download this game easily, for free, with no DRM. The DRM adds nothing to the customer experience, does not prevent copying, and treats you like a criminal.This game does not cost $50. it costs $50 per person, per computer."
1,I agree with the consensus...,"DRM is a pain, especially if you get the itch to play an old game and you legitimately purchased and find that you are locked out because you either misplaced a CD key or activation servers are no longer functional."
1,A decent game let down by DRM,"The DRM made me feel dirty buying the game, knowing that i might potentially lose something i rightfully bought just because of several reinstalls. But I wanted the game that badly. I waited for eons for it.And ultimately, it's a good game. Not great. Probably because of the overhype. I played simearth eons ago and this game comes closest to updating on that. Still, it feels like EA was trying to placate gamers from both casual and hardcore ends of the spectrum; and in the end the game feels shallow. It could have been so much more.It's not too late to save the game, maxis. release those expansions and make each phase deeper than what it is."
3,"Hard to load, but my 11 yo nephew liked it","Ok, so I have not played this game as I bought it for my nephew and this seems to be the target audience. My nephew has played this allot since I bought it for him. The concept seems fun as you walk a creature through evolutionary steps. He is always laughing and showing off his creations. If my rating was based strictly on how much fun he is having with it I would give it a 5 star.However, since I bought it for him, I was the one that had to load it, and that was not fun. I am not a computer programmer, but I can usually load a new piece of software on a PC. This took my sister and I an hour to get it to load. We had to go to youtube to figure out how to load it. That is why I gave it a 3 star. So other than the loading issue, I got a good price on Amazon and it shipped in plenty of time for his birthday. So if you are buying this for a kid I would recommend it."
2,Warning - Don't use the patch with Vista,"My kids had to have this game. They saved and pooled their money and installed it on the computer. That was great. It was working. They loved it. Spore is, after all, a fun game. However, then they downloaded the recommended patch. The game would no longer load. We spent over an hour chatting with tech support. Spore's tech support's final solution was to create a new administrative account on our PC just to play Spore on and reinstall Spore in that account and not install the patch.If you have Vista, do not update the software."
1,"No, just no....","Thanks EA, you have saved me money that otherwise would've been yours if you had the slightest realization that there actually are people out there with integrity. I've never considered getting a cracked version of any software, but I can't say I'm not going to look into it at this point.Maybe the pirates have the right idea..."
2,"Aside from DRM issues, Spore didnt match the hype, too SHORT","The game just doesn't live up to the hype. I was looking forward to playing the game for a very long time, over the course of the semester. But I beat the entire game in about 15 hours. The game had so much potential to be great, but it just got lost somewhere out there.Sad day."
1,DRM makes this a rental,I didn't realize this software had DRM when I purchased it. Returned immediately. Way overpriced for a rental.
1,no DRM,the DRM ruins it. I wont be buying it and I'll be suggesting anyone who is interested not buy it; and actively make fun of them if they do buy it.
2,Not even mad about DRM . . . It's just not a good game.,"I played Spore on my friend's computer for about an hour. He told me to keep playing because it would become fun. All I can say is it should have become fun faster. The beginning of the game is so pointless, so slow. I couldn't make it to the rest of the game. It's more like lets play dress up instead of a real game. I don't even think the creature creator is that good. I get so frustrated trying to create the shape I want or the look I want. Overall, I think it is an interesting topic, but better left to the science books. Sorry Will, not this time."
1,Yes enjoyed... but DMR is simply a scam,"I'm really tired of buying stuff that doesn't really belong to me. i have two DVD's that play the ""Don't copy/pirate this DVD"" trailer and I have to sit down Every single time trough all the thing. Now I have this game that... I paid, but I don't own.To me it's very simple. If I download the movie, I don't have to sit trough anything annoying... and if I download a crack, simply, I don't have to worry about changing any hardware or machine and losing my game. In other words... I'm buying my games and movies and suffering for doing it. It really makes me mad, but this DMR is beyond acceptance... DON'T BUY IT."
1,Will not buy because of DRM.,"I've been waiting to play this game since it was first announced but I will not buy it now that I know it's using Securom DRM and is limited to 3 installs, ever.This means EA knows that this game will be temporary and forgotten in probably less than 2 years. There's no replay value if it cannot be installed as many times as necessary. So basically they're planning to make money on the hype alone, like a bad Hollywood blockbuster movie that goes off the screens after two weeks. EA obviously does not care about its own product.This is not worth more than $5."
1,DRM kills it.,"The game is mediocre at best, but what kills it is unauthorized DRM software, limitations not listed in the End User License Agreement or on the box, and offers to upsell you to what should have come in the box in the first place.The game installs software which is nigh impossible to remove from your machine.I have already been in contact with a lawyer over the issue, and I can't be the only one. Spyware and false advertising - way to go EA! You have ensured I will never buy another of your products ever again. Here's hoping you pay through the nose in damages to everyone jilted by this trainwreck of a piece of software."
1,Dont....,"Boringggg....tedious, and dont ever buy anything with such DRACONIAN DRM as this.Our family is moving away completely from any products with DRM of any sort. IF they presuppose us to be criminals, then we must act like one. We urge downloading p2p for any product with DRM.But we urge all to BUY any product without DRM."
1,Draconian DRM,The game is not what was promised (which is not really a surprise) and the DRM implementation flies in the face of fair use.
4,"Innovative game, just not fun to play","SPORE has been a while in the making and now it's been released, but it's not as I thought. The game is very innovative and lets you be relatively free. The only problem is this game is more of a chore than something fun to play. At first the game is really interesting, but once you figure out it's really just the same (wash, rinse, and repeat) game over and over again. The best part of the game is the creator, which has limitless ways of building things.Btw, it works great on a Macbook Pro."
1,Terrible Game,This game was a total disappointment and I would recommend against anyone buying it. Stay away!
1,You will most likely have a disabled game soon,The draconian DRM will most likely cause you to loose your game when you upgrade your computer. At least it will be a huge hassle to get a new hard disk if you have a few of this kind of DRM on your PC.
1,Do NOT buy from this seller (Digitalville),"After multiple failed attempts to install this game due to a bad installation code, we contacted EA (the manufacturer). They confirmed the installation code is invalid. We returned the game for a refund."
1,Disappointing,"Purchased this item as a gift. It does NOT work on any of the Mac computers in our home, and only worked on an older Windows XP desktop system gathering dust in an unused bedroom. I cannot recommend this item for current Mac computers."
1,very disappointing,"The DRM makes it a solid non-buy. I received it as a present, but returned it when I found out how it worked. I was disappointed anyway after playing around with the creature creator. It's just a boring sim-type toy, not really a game at all. Very tedious. I'd rather play Civ IV in the end."
1,Boycott DRM!,"I was so excited about this game along with what seemed like the rest of the gaming world -- that is, of course, until I found out about their DRM madness -.-EA has become a horrible company, so drunk on their so called success that they think they can get away with anything. Well the people have spoken! Boycott this game until they take out the DRM for good! And do the same for all DRM software! We will not stand for this!!"
1,Might try it when the DRM is removed,"Looks cute, quirky and fun. Shame I won't be buying it until EA wakes up and figures out that punishing paying customers and rewarding piracy isn't really a good business strategy. DURH! Doesn't help that they are being very belligerent and arrogant about it, basically telling paying customers ""Tough poopies if you don't like DRM. What you think doesn't really matter. Just keep giving us money."""
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"Huge potential molded into a crappy expansion pack engine. I am incredibly disappointed. DRM & cute sums it up.Played for close to a week, watched the forums hopefully for plans to correct the mistakes and then saw the ad for the ""expansion pack"" already and I have now written this game off as a lost cause and a lesson learned. Very disappointed. If you are an avid supporter of DRM and cute, dumbed down game play in a package meant to act as a bottomless pit of never ending expansion packs in which to toss your hard earned money, then this is the game for you.I cannot overemphasize how disappointed I am in Spore. Don't waste your money or your time.Looks like I have space to fill.Junk, garbage, trash, waste, debris, detritus, dreck, dregs, dross, filth, muck, offal, rubbish, rubble, scrap, scrapings, sewage, slop, sweepings, swill, balderdash, blather, bunkum, claptrap, drivel, idiocy, piffle, poppycock, rigmarole, rubbish, tomfoolery, trash, twaddle, etc."
1,"So much potential, poorly executed","The game's concept and scope were and still are great. Who wouldn't want to build their own creature from scratch and guide it through a lifetime of evolution.Gameplay: Each stage of evolution presents a different style of gameplay. While this concept sounds great on paper it does make actual play feel disjointed.Graphics: The cell and creature graphics are great. The creature editor is easy to use. I found the axillary graphics, the world in which your creatures live a bit lackluster.Technical: Unfortunately this is where the game gets killed. EA has implemented a very strict license on the game. You can only install it 3 times, period. Doesn't mater if your computer fraps or you uninstall the game, 3's the limit.Bottemline: It is an okay game. However, the technical limitations imposed by EA make its price hard to justify."
1,Can no longer play the game due to crashing,"I was able to play the game until I reached the space age. After that, the game crashes on start-up.EA said that they do not offer refunds for games after they have been installed....So basically if you ""try"" to play a game by installing it, you are waiving your right to a refund if it does not function correctly."
1,Yet another canceled order,"I had the game on pre-order as well and after finding out about the DRM they choose, I canceled. It really saddens me that the decisions made by the execs at EA ruined all the hard work by Wright and his team. What I really don't understand is who they think they are stopping. I would gladly hand over more than $50 to have this game without unwanted spyware wrapped as DRM. Did they stop the pirates from getting a copy onto the web? Not even a little bit. Did they stop a legitimate customer from actually purchasing their product? Indeed they did."
1,"Terrible game, DRM makes it worse","I purchased this game off the EA store. The game itself has been dumbed down so far that it is no longer enjoyable, in fact, any design actions that you make have practically zero impact on your actual gameplay. I've played flash games with far more depth. All the promise that this game had has been swept away by profoundly limited gameplay; the creativity that you wield has no actual effect on the game itself.To make matters even worse, the Securom activation scheme is draconian and makes this purchase even more worthless. THREE activations ever? I've just shelled out fifty bucks for a trial version. The pirated version is by far the better product, at least I can play it two reformats from now."
1,Amazon should be ashamed for deleting customer reviews.,Regardless of your stance on DRM reviews should never be deleted. I am highly disapointed that amazon has done this for the sake of sales. Please restore all review for this product. Until this has happened Amazon will never see another cent from me.
1,DRM,The demo was fun. I was really looking forward to this until I found out about how the DRM was implemented as well as the number of installs you can do. No ordering for me until they change this.
1,never going to buy,"EA seems to think that my computer isn't mine. They seem to think that they can choose whatever gets installed on my machine via their draconian DRM, (heretofore referred to as the evil Dr. M). Well, I don't have anything much against your average Dr. M (I buy games off of Steam for heaven's sake) but when it goes as far as EA's, then it's time to boycott.EA, when the general consensus among your fans is the buy the game and then pirate a copy to install, you've done a bad thing."
1,DRM amounts to planned obsolesence,"DRM schemes such as this, which only serve to hurt paying customers are the main reason I have all but stopped buying PC games.This system requires an activation server, and based on EAs track record it's practically guaranteed that EA will shut down these servers in a few years after EA has decided that the game is in ""legacy"" status, which means that all the customers who bought the game previously will no longer be able to use it."
1,Thanks for nothing!,"EA - What is wrong with you!?? You infected my PC with this DRM crap, causing me to uninstall and reinstall 3 times - Now you want me to BUY another copy of the game?? ! Well, off to the torrrent site I go for a FIX. Thanks for nothing."
1,I will not buy it due to ridiculous copyright control,"I was really excited about this game, I decided not to buy it after I leadned that actually I just rent it, with a right to install 3 times."
1,DRM makes this game a wash.,"Spore is one of the most long awaited games to be released this year. The critical response has been largely good. However, each and every one of those reviewers now has EA sponsored spyware, a glorified virus, that they cannot remove, installed at super user level(In layman's terms, that means the DRM program outranks YOU in your computer hierarchy.). These draconian DRM measures are designed to prevent piracy, but hackers had DRM copies of Spore available on the internet within a day of release. Don't let EA treat you like a criminal. You should never have to pirate a game you own to avoid 3rd party spyware. Don't buy this game until the DRM measures are patched out."
1,DRM killed this game,"I, like so many others, waited ever so patiently for this game. Years worth of hype, teasers and previews... maybe that's why EA thought they could get away with such pervasive and game-ruining DRM for this title.I know for a fact that they will not get my sale, and it's certainly looking like MANY others feel the same way.EA needs to wise up very quickly, or this game will be a colossal failure on the level of the Atari 2600's E.T. game."
1,Terrible game with a terrible DRM scheme,"The game has failed at many different levels. There is absolutely no incentive to do anything in the game. I think I have just wasted 50$ over a piece of junk. Your actions and your creations have negligible impact on the story/gameplay. It is pathetic. The only neat thing about the game is various different creators and the concept of evolution in video games.And, the frustrating DRM scheme of 3 installs per copy is just ridiculous. Who do you think we are, EA? Criminals?"
2,spore is a cartoony moderately fun game with a bad aftertaste,the game starts off very fun but after about 10 hours you realize that most of the game is over. also the copy protection and limited activations leaves a foul taste in my mouth. overall i was a little disapointed with the game.
1,Not a Chance,"I was really contemplating getting this game, until I saw the security measures. Reformatting a computer happens, and if you make it a hassle for your customers to recover a game they spent $50 on, then what is the point. Games are suppose to be about fun. not frustration. No, you won't be getting a dime from me. Also, the more I read, the more I hear how bored most people are with the game. Good job EA, you just alienated a huge percentage of your customer base."
1,purchase EA product and LOSE. DRM FTW!!!,"Draconian DRM will make you repurchase or call EA to beg for another activation if you have to reinstall more then 3 times on your computer from your purchased retail disk. This means that if your windows installation needs to be reinstalled for any reason and you reinstall the game you will use one of your 3 reinstallations. After you have installed this game 3 times you will be unable to play the game until you beg EA for another activation. How many more times might you have to reinstall the game in a few years, 4 times 5 times, or more? Will EA give you more activation or will they treat you like a pirate and make it impossible for you to play the game that you paid $50 for? So what this means is that the pirates who download the game will be able to reinstall it as many times as they want forever. I have already had to install the game 2x because of a hard drive failure.Sorry customer you lose when you purchase a Game from EA."
1,DRM = no go,"Wow, I almost bought this game until I read about the Securom/DRM issues, thanks to all the posters here and on the other boards. I'll actually consider buying it if they get rid of that garbage."
1,upset,I'm very upset with EA. You lay out $50 to find out it's a rental with their DRM policy. Then when you go to their website and hit contacts they ask you to sign-in. What kind of crap is that? You have to join them to contact them? It's business decisions like this that's destroying PC gaming. I'm just glad we have the internet and Amazon to voice our opinions.
1,I really wanted to like this game,"I want to like this game but knowing that I have to call tech support after three installs makes this purchase highly regrettable. I already have to reformat the computer I had installed it on, and I'm planning on purchasing a new computer next month. So I've already used up 2 slots and if anything goes wrong I have have to call them and let someone know I'm not a thief. Talk about alienating your customers."
1,I don't RENT games from EA,"Spore's 3 install limit is ridiculous. You are essentially RENTING the game, and if you have a string of bad luck and your computer dies a couple of times, or you want to reinstall windows to get rid of junk, or if you simply buy a new computer if you are past your 3 install limit all you have is a paper weight.Maybe it is just me but I want a game, not a paper weight.Too bad there is no 0 or 0.5 stars."
2,"Good game, but constantly crashes on a Mac, and has absurd reinstall limit","It actually is an interesting game with a unique concept. Unfortunately, on my macbook, it's barely playable because of the constant crashing. It doesn't auto-save, so this is an even bigger issue. I've also resisted reinstalling it, to see if that solves the crashing issues, since the publisher has stuck on a ridiculous limit to the number of times you can install it on your own computer."
1,Renting vs. Owning,"This is a game rental with a $60.00 price tag. 3 activations is an insult to gamers. The forced online activation was bad enough, and relies on existing servers to actually exist and be supported in the future to be able to install your game, assuming you have installs left. Any promises made my any company to remove these kinds of features in the future or unreliable at best and completely unenforceable. Don't buy this game. Don't reward this kind of behavior."
1,How fun can a game be when you know the installation is being held hostage?,"The game may be fun, but we've seen this DRM bit before and look at the trouble for consumers it's caused. How many people have lost music and a money investment thanks to DRM in purchased MP3 or AAC? Amazon doesn't sell DRM in their music downloads, so why the heck are they allowing it in software? Bad move Amazon!"
1,3 Install Limit Unacceptable,"You just can't commit money to something that only lets you reinstall 3 times. PC's die all the time. Windows dies more often. When you reformat for a virus or just Windows losing its mind, you've got to reinstall, and that means losing this game to a pointless limit imposed by Electronic Arts. Get rid of the stupid limitations and let me use my game."
1,Pissed off OWNER,"Just another pissed off owner of this game. I haven't read over the 1000+ reviews, but I'm sure people have already complained about how the manual plainly states that more than one account can be added to a single installation of the game, which is a BOLD-FACED LIE!!! In order for my wife and I to have separate accounts on the copy THAT WE PAID FOR (ARE YOU LISTENING, EA?????), we have to BUY ANOTHER COPY OF THE DAMN GAME!!! Give me an F-ing break. This just drives honest people to pirate games. I might as well start searching warez sites for some kind of crack. Bite me EA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1"
1,What good did the DRM do?,"Like many, I pre-ordered this game direct from EA and just a few days ago found out about the back door they install on my PC in the form of their root-kit DRM package. Sadly I am forced to return this title for a refund. I cannot accept this vulnerability. In the end what did they accomplish?, The pirates still had this game out a week prior to its release. And anyone who installs a legit purchased copy now has a less secure system. How was this productive?It is a shame the Genius of Will Wright and his team has to be marred by the arrogant, blatant disregard EA has for the security of their consumers."
1,Good Game marred by overly harsh DRM tactics,"Spore is a fine game and you are sure to get at least 8 hours of quality playtime out of it. However, an overly intrusive digital rights management scheme (DRM) means that you'll probably never get to find out."
1,Keep it going...,"Nothing new here, just wanted voice my opinion about the DRM by putting up another 1 star review.<Edit> After going on many forums discussing whether or not this is the right place to oppose the DRM, I have decided to update my stance. Consumers affect the market by ""voting"" with their dollars. I have ""voted"" by not purchasing this games. To those who say, ""but you haven't played the game I shouldn't have to be exposed to your review!"" I say all I'm am doing is ""campaigning"" And this is the perfect place for it.VOTE NO TO DRMAlso, if possible, vote no to EA and Sony, I know that's asking a lot though. Thank you for your time."
1,This kind of DRM is unacceptable.,There is no way I'll ever buy anything like this. We're not even allowed to upgrade hardware. I would have a game rendered useless within a year.
1,DRM Hell - Doesn't Work Under Multi-User Environments!!!!,"The DRM on this game is RIDICULOUS. My husband and I share a MacBook. He installed the game under his user account. Later on I logged in under my account and started the game up.IT ASKED ME FOR A REGISTRATION KEY!I didn't want to use up a second install, so I guess I'm stuck playing under his account. This means that all of our user-data is shared.Not only is this game limited to three installations, it is limited to only three separate user accounts ON THE SAME COMPUTER.I am so mad. If I could return this game, I would."
2,Excessive overhype,"Not really any need for a big review. The game was overhyped, and with the amount of effort that EA Games put into it, it was a waste of their time. It wasn't what they claimed it to be. Each of the individual game genres was so incredibly dumbed down. I was highly disappointed. The straw that broke the camel's back was the DRM restrictions. They were pointless - no one is going to take the time to try and copy the game any way."
1,DRM,"This game installs a very very bad DRM into the system that is near impossible to remove. If you were to download a version off of an illegal file sharing site it would not have this DRM. So those of us who wish to be legal end up buying the game and then downloading it anyways. so long as this game ships with DRM that can not be removed, or where users are not CLEARLY warned before hand, this game will get no more then a 1 star rating from me in ANY way.This is a very, very bad move for EA and Maxis. I used to really like Maxis too, I played SimCity, SimCity 2000, SimCity 3000, The Sims, SimTower and The Sims 2, but the DRM on this just sucks, don't get it."
1,DRM Kills This Game,DRM makes this game unplayable. DO NOT BUY unless you are willing to spend a lot of time just trying to install the game and getting through all of their rights management crap.AGAIN DO NOT BUY!
1,Dreadful install limitations and poor play,"So .. waited ages for the game, installed on my main PC and a laptop for when I travel. Yup - main PC crashes - twice and could not reinstall Spore until I called ""home"". Now I hear that no further installs are possible. Hmmm ... good policy this.Gameplay - from sea to space is boring as heck after the first time round - only the space element is playable more than once. Even then, I struggle to see why this has obtained rave reviews; different playing strategies seem to result in little different outcomes. It is pretty and different but would not buy it again if I had known these things before.I recommend staying clear for both the DRM issues and the dreadfully limited replayability - 5 hours and was done."
1,Another Canceled Pre-order due to DRM,See the numerous reviews citing DRM issues. I upgrade my machines and am pretty lousy at keeping track of physical disks. I have no interest in being pointlessly forced to call EA support in the event that I have to reinstall my game a few times.
2,Repetative,"The first 4 parts of the game are just eat, evolve, grow. Nothing more. cell stage was interesting only because it was a novel idea. the other 3 stages blow and are boring. Space looks great and is fun for about 2 hours after that it's very repetative and boring. The game is very easy. I aslo don't like the drm, $50 to rent a game stinks. Limiting my installs is retarded."
1,The DRM isn't copy protection.,"This DRM isn't going to stop game piracy and EA knows it. The SecuROM DRM contained in Spore is for implementing EA's new stand alone pc game subscription business model. You pay for the game but don't own it in any way shape or form. You relinquish your right to make a back-up copy, install it as many times as you wish on your pc's, and re-sell it. If you do some research online you will see that this is all part of EA's new business model, along with ""micro-transactions"" and in-game advertising. As bad as this may sound for the future of pc gaming, all hope is not lost. As consumers we have the power to flex our muscle and tighten our grip on our wallets."
1,DRM sucks,DRM makes this game suck.the fun is sucked out and swirled in a blender of content for gamers around the world.we waited years for this?
1,Good potential spoiled by bad DRM.,I was really looking forward to this game and planned on purchasing it until I found out it was infected with Securom DRM. No Thanks!!!
1,Trivial and terrible disc protection,"This game is novel in the beginning, even fun, but as you progress though the levels it becomes tedious and trivial. You play forever and get nothing except for more grind and crummy gameplay.And the DRM, which is copy right protection for those who may not know, is insane. You have to be connected to the internet or no play. Have a system failure and reinstall, careful only one more install left. Thats right you can only install the game 3 times, then you have to call so EA can make sure your not a crook.The bottom line is if you buy this game then EA will treat you like a criminal!!!"
1,No more DRM,Pass on this one. Let them know that we won't tolerate companies that continue to punish their paying customers while presenting absolutely zero challenge to the people who choose to violate civil copyright laws.
4,Spore on Not to Spore,"I bought this game for my son. I went to Game Stop, Target etc.. I tried Amazon and Ah hah... I saw one. My son said is good...."
1,"Has promise, excessive rights management","I had picked this game up at my local B&M; retailer on the recommendation of a friend, and upon watching him play it the game seemed to be fun. However, upon learning of the intrusive DRM implemented in the game, I decided not to keep the game, and will be returning it unopened for a full refund. I understand the justification put forth for Digital Rights Management, however this game goes too far. For a game with as big an online component as it has, it seems rather excessive.Unless the publisher puts out a patch removing the DRM or cutting it back, I will be doing without Spore."
1,No DRM Thanks,"THis game was going to go on the Christmas list, however I just found out about DRM. I won't buy any game that uses the same activation process of M$.EA is out of control, first muscling out sports (football), now this. They just joined the same S list as Sony."
1,Three little letters - DRM,There isn't much to say other than the DRM has ruined the game. Any product that is limited by a set amount of installs completely ruins the experience and will cause problems in the future.
1,Good game held back by DRM,Spores DRM is the main issue I have had with this program. It blocks you beyond 3 installs and will not prevent piracy in anyway in fact it encourages it
1,bad EA,Outdated way to use DRM do not buy help send EA a message that you cant treat honest people like criminals
1,These games should be like board games,I will not pay to rent. PC games should be like Board games. If I buy Monopoly at the store I can turn around and sell it at my yard sale to anyone I want and no one would care. EA is nutZ to think I or others will ever rent a game if we know in advanced about this.
1,Not interested in DRM. I want a game!,"I'd love to purchase this game, but I can't in good conscience buy it until EA removes the draconian DRM and treats me like a customer, not a pirate."
1,So disappointing,"Besides the DRM issues, which haven't really bothered me yet, the game doesn't seem to have a lot of relayability...I've played several games and am now totally bored with it. Did not find the space part interesting, even on a difficulty setting of easy, there seemed to be nothuing but make work to slog thru...no fun for me."
2,Too easy.,"I managed to play through to the space level in a total of 6 hours. I know I can replay the game tons and tons, given the possibilities for creating creatures, but I feel sort of jipped for paying so much for a game you can beat in a day or two.Anyways, reading these reviews on Amazon now I'm super worried about the health of my PC too :("
1,DRM Stopped the show,"I would have purchased this game, but after reading reviews and past bad experiences with DRM/EA I will be avoiding it. I would suggest that anyone else do the same. DRM methods like the one used here are wrong and the only way we can tell the companies this is with our dollars.In the past, my copies of EA games ""Expired"", meaning they were too cheap to keep the servers running or allow 3rd parties to run servers. In EA's line of thinking, we should only play our copy of the game until the next version comes out that costs more money.Again, no thanks."
1,Can't buy something guaranteed to break,"I don't know how dumb EA thinks we are, but I for one will not buy something that is guaranteed to break after a few installs. If I buy something, I don't want to be treated like a criminal, and I want the software to be easy to replace if my system goes belly up."
1,Huge Disappointment. DRM Deal-breaker,"Maxis promised the moon, but pulled a Peter Molyneux by not delivering on its hype. That, combined with the awful DRM, (You own a license to play Spore, not the game itself. This is standard procedure with big budget PC titles, but is rarely enforced this harshly), make this one a dud."
1,DRM = 1 Star,Don't bother buying. Have fun with your sales EA. Hope you guys make a loss on this game.
2,Great graphics boring game...,I got a whole 2 evenings of play out of this game before I could not take it anymore... I can see it being more fun for 9-14 year olds maybe? There is no challenge to this game at all and the process of moving through evolution is way too easy. It was a big waste of money for me buyers be warned...
1,DRM!,"OMG I have DRM in my computer! Bad thing that I can't even lend this game to my brother to play, now I have a potential spyware on my computer! And from what I've read it can't be taken out. I'm regretting buying this game, I mean who in their right mind would install potential threats to their personal PC? I hate this game! :("
1,$50 to rent a game!!!!,Digital Rights Management protect this game so you do not own it... you are renting it! I don't know about you but I do NOT pay $50 to rent a game!Just say no to this POS!Thanks but no thanks!
1,Spore this,"did you read all the other reviews before getting here? Hope so, since I'll be short.Good game, lots of innovation, mostly works. Some bugs (like in crashes at space stage a few times) and terrible game balance for 'easy' mode (good luck casual gamers, wish you well with space stage if you have bad neighbors).The DRM issue didn't seem like it'd affect me because I was installing it onto the Mac side of an iMac. But I believe the recent notice by EA that they were adding SecuROM to the MAC games that are ported over from PC includes Spore. Even if not, it seems like it will be polluting my OS with its who-knows-how-bad background activities for any future EA games. This would force me to install on the Windows partition and let IT get screwed up with such stuff.EA needs a board member revolt and leadership change.Oh, and draconian, gotta include that word here somehow."
1,OK Game - Terrible Install - 3 installs is not the problem,"If you have a 'secure' computer and are not comfortable working with security settings, forget this game.My experience has nothing to do with installng the game 3 times.After paying $50 for a game, I don't want to have to go through all kinds of machinations with my internet security to get a game or any software to workBeware: If you are are a good internet citizen and keep your computer secure, you likely will have have to waltz with your security settings to get Spore to work. Spore wants you to dance a different step. Don't waste your time with EA's control of your privacy and security.My internet was down for 3 days when I bought the game and I could not play it. After my internet was up, it took an hour to find the internet answers to tweak Norton Internet Security to get the game to work.The game is good but spending good money to go through this is discusting. EA, you need a new managment team"
4,Attention!!,"Do not listen to other reviews! This game is very fun despite what anyone says. It has the greatest custimizing system out there. You do very fun arcade like gamplay in cell stage as a fish like creature. In creature stage you are in a 3D world inhabbited by built in creaturs and creatures made by other players. After you custimize your creature for the last time, you move on to tribal stage. Tribal stage is real time strategy where you control all of your creatures. Then you go to civilization phase where it's still real time stratedgy exept you command vehicles and fight your own creature since you divided up into cities. Last, you control a spaceship with a bunch of tools and weapons. You now go from planet to planet capturing and obducting."
4,You guys are idiots,"Thats it, you guys are idiots. This game is fun. Just because you cant install it more than 3 times it sucks? I cant believe how many ""fans"" of this game don't like it because of that fact....Get over it."
1,DRM software can make your computer less safe,"This game uses a draconian ""digital rights management"" system. While the safety of this DRM system has yet to be determined, many DRM systems are considered ""malicious"" by anti-virus software companies. Some DRM systems, such as those once used by Sony Music, actually make computers more susceptible to viruses. Steer well-clear of this one for now."
1,"Forget the DRM, the game itself is terrible","By now, everyone who's interested in this game probably have heard about the DRM issue, so I'm not going to go there (there are plenty of reviews that discusses how horrible DRM is and how greedy EA is).The gameplay of this game is just terrible. Disappointing. It's so simple and mindless. You spend the first three stages eating other creatures. That's it. You run around and eat, then mate. And you repeat that over and over. Everything after that is just an uninspired, dull, uninvolved real time strategy game that even a strategy game from 10 years ago would've more depth and creativity.Don't get the game. EA needs to learn a lesson here."
1,Great Game. CRAPPY DRM,"This game is fun as heck to play. I bought it but I did NOT know about the DRM. The game is a solid 4 or 5 stars. Add DMR and this game deserves a 1 star at MOST. Screw you EA. I am a person who like to install it, play it through once, uninstall it, pick it up a month or more and reinstall it, etc. With the 3 install max... I'm SCREWED. I wasted $50 on you jerks. I hate this crap. I'll have to look for a hack for the game that I legally purchased. Screw you EA for making my life more difficult when I want to play your games.I hope everyone gives this game a bad review. Let's send grass root opinions to these executives. We should do this to all DRM games. Give them ALL a 1 star rating. Of course you should do this after really playing the game but no game in the world would ever be worth anything higher than 1 star given that it has DRM."
1,Not One More Cent,"EA shouldn't do this to people... Punishing the people who actually buy your games just to punish the people who acquire it through outside channels is bad marketing... if they haven't realized by now... if someone doesn't want to pay to play a game, they wont... period.EA will never receive another cent from me..."
1,"Awaited so eagerly, thwarted by DRM.","I have waited for this game since the earliest rumors of it. Built a machine that could run it (for reasons other than running it). Played the Creature Creator demo, and was shocked by the fact that even the demo tried to infect my system with SecuROM.At least the demo didn't have limited activations.Three? No thanks. This is supposed to be for casual gamers, which I guess is what I am these days. Normally I install a game, play for a week, and uninstall it afterward, usually leaving my save files in case I decide to come back to it a few months later. I would use up three activations far too quickly.Not going to buy if they're going to treat me like a criminal. DRM is a show-stopper."
1,This game gave my PC cancer,"There I was, all excited to play this game after waiting years, then suddenly after installing this game, my pc has been diagnosed with cancer. It's terminally ill now. I can't remove the cancer that this game infected it with because the fine print says I legally have to let it kill my machine. It's really sad. I can't play this game, and now I can't use my computer for much longer before it dies. I wish I had never picked up the filthy habit of purchasing games with DRM on them. If I had only read the warning on the side of the box and believed it. I used to think it would never happen to me, I would never be the person suffering from DRM cancer. Now here I am with computer expenses coming at me left and right as I try to keep my machine alive and running, but why? Why do I do this. I guess it's time I let it die and just go out and buy some other game that doesn't have DRM cancer on it."
1,EA ruined a great game,"EA recently announced that DRM wasn't an issue to more than 0.2% of it's customers. Listen, those who pirate this game are downloading it through bit-torrent. Those of us who would purchase the game deserve fair use! Heavy DRM with consumer hostile enforcement is not the answer. EA needs to support its paying customers, treating them with fair use, and we'll in turn support EA in sales. Until the DRM is fair, I'll keep my score at a 1 Star reflecting how desperately EA needs to remove DRM from this would-be fun game."
1,"Neat concept, but....","To keep this short and sweet:Spore boils down to a cool idea that was poorly executed. The creature creator is pretty fun, and one can spend a fair amount of time on it. However, the overall gameplay feels shallow and repetitive -- the space exploration part of the game feels particularly lacking in this regard.Also, I absolutely despise SecuROM and all other invasive/draconian copy protection schemes. I was *not* happy to realize it had been installed on my computer (didn't find out about that until after the fact). If I'd known the game included SecuROM, I never would've purchased it in the first place.The game experience itself is marginally okay, but the SecuROM issue really drags it down for me. Spore isn't terrible, but it's definitely not all it could've been. Yet another tragic case of where the game developer's reach exceeded their grasp."
1,TPB has this game DRM free,"DRM is unacceptable on this game, I have more than 3 computers. Why pay for this lackluster game if you're going to be treated like a criminal from square 1. Pirate Bay has a copy for FREE where you can play no matter when or where, computers die, formats are necessary... 3 installs? give me a break."
1,amazing game but one star because of the drm.,"Great game really, but once you pay for the game do you truly own it?The answer is no. If you format your comp every few months like i do, the game will stop working after a couple re-installs."
1,DRM Killed the Video Game Star,"Its simple: DRM Kills. Its pointless too, if I wanted to there are about a dozen sites I could download a DRM free hacked version of this game that works perfectly. I won't though, because I would really like to own this game, and pay for it to encourage more really creative games like this, but as long as this draconian, idiotic, insulting, and dangerous DRM is affixed to it, I won't. Get a clue EA."
1,Schadenfreude never felt so good...,Thank you EA for continuing to screw your customers. After purchasing what may be the most bug riddled mess in gaming history from you - BF2142 - I hate you.I hope this is a financial disaster for you EA. You deserve to be hammered for your history of customer hating policies.Schadenfreude never felt so good.....
1,So much potential - ruined by EA and a DRM.,"The person who I feel worst for is poor Will Wright. He slaved over this potential masterpiece - even so far as to get Sid Mier involved!But the whole game is ruined by over-simplified gameplay - even for casual players. Way too easy even on ""Hard"" setting - and can actually feel overwhelming at times - which is a feat for such an easy game.The ignored the power-user (which is a MISTAKE for a PC-only game) - you can't even tune the AA.And not to mention that EA has stuck it's hand in the game - putting a DRM onto the software - which ONLY LETS YOU INSTALL THIS THREE TIMES, no exceptions.I say we all call EA's DRM restore number and give them flak. This is ridiculous.Poor Will Wright."
1,Sad about Spore,"I went to Amazon to purchase this, my first PC game in long time and I saw the reviews. *sigh* DRM is the downfall of legitimate digital purchasing. I refuse to buy ANY product that expires after any number of multiple installs. But three? 3 flipping installs... ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!Let me put it this way. Would you have bought Super Mario Bros. 3 if it stopped working after you had played it on 3 different Nintendo consoles? H--- no you wouldn't have!GAMES RESTRICTED BY DRM CANNOT BECOME CLASSICS! CAN YOU HEAR ME EA? CAN YOU???I'll go ahead and pass this one up (my money will be better spent on Starcraft 2 - if it ever comes out). In the meantime, I'll play Super Mario Bros. 3 in my 5th NES. Funny thing, classic consoles wear out before the games do."
1,EA + DRM = FAIL,"As long as this game has DRM, I will refuse to buy. I will also tell all my friends that are interested in this game not to buy, as well. DRM is both insulting and ridiculous. By attempting to maximize your profits, you're alienating your audience and making yourselves look even worse. Yes, I'm talking to you EA. I hope the company burns to the ground soon.Boycott EA!"
1,The copy protection won't work on my PC,"This game apparently has some kind of copy protection called ""SecureROM"" or something. It crashes my computer, so I can't play it. Even after uninstalling the game it left some program or drivers on my system that make my computer unstable. Pretty big hassle for a game; I'm trying to get a refund."
1,What a complete waste...,"I feel very very bad for the people who spent so much time and effort devloping this game only to have it come out as a ""rental"" basically. When you buy this game you only by it for a limited amount of times. In addition to that you get lovely additional software that comes with their protection which can very well screw up your computer. This game was highly anticipated and its a shame that it ended up being this way immediately on release. EA needs to change its way fast, and other game developers need to understand that limiting a customer to ""rules"" of a purchase of a game is NOT going to fly. You better believe it!"
1,My kid really really wants me to buy this game,"My daughter is pressuring me to get the game but the fact that something additional gets installed on my machine is deterrent enough. Like one of the other reviewers mentioned, if every software I install did this. I dont need this sort of junk of my machine.Plus the DRM is pretty sucky. It's like Quickbooks, which I do own, so I am aware of how sucky it can get. eg. I needed to reinstall my copy of Quickbooks 2004 cos of an OS corruption. Of course, the Quicken activation servers no longer do the 2004 version. So I am stuck with a piece of useless software, unless I pay them more $$$ and upgrade of course.This might not happen with EA but I'm not taking any chances."
1,Broken by design,"A good game, but the heavy handed digital rights managment is WAY too heavy handed. You can only install the game three times - meaning if you swap hardware two more times over the life of you playing the game, you'll be hosed and unable to play. While the game doesnt have to call EA every ten day anymore, the SecuROM is more like malware or spyware than copy protection.And it doesnt even work - the copy protection, I mean. So you have all this hassle for a reasonably fun game and the pirates already hacked it up. Not a smart move EA."
1,Won't buy it till the DRM is removed,"I also was looking forward to this release, but won't buy it until (unless?) the DRM is removed. Pirates are going to get this game for free anyways; why are legitimate customers being penalized and inconvenience?[Ignore my fun rating; I haven't played it yet]"
1,All hype,"I was expecting Darwinian battles of survival in epic proportions. However, I was disappointed to no end. The game simply did not live up to the hype. The DRM is also a terrible pain. Save your money play with the creature creator demo and then forget this game exists."
1,Worst Game I've ever bought,"I followed the release of this game pretty much from its initial conception and was super excited about the concept from the beginning. Although it had gotten bad reviews at its release, I still went ahead and got the game with an open mind. I wonder why they thought that taking 5 bad copies of other games and patching them together would be revolutionary. There is really not much they did right with this game. Also the DRM on this game is ridiculous. I mean, who would want to steal this game, anyway?"
1,DRM is killing what could be a good game.,"I have been assisting my roommate in getting his copy of spore working for the past two days. A problem with the DRM copy protection has completely blocked him from playing this game. This is a prime example of why DRM is BAD!Also, I would like to pose one question to you all. What happens when EA takes the DRM servers offline for good? At that point, you will never be able to play this game again (without playing a pirated version at least).Save yourself the trouble of trying to play this game legitimately and just go download a torrent."
1,DRM means it's a rental,"I had been looking forward to this game but the DRM limits you to three installs so it's really just a rental. I refuse to try to get through to EA on the telephone to beg them to let me install a game I paid $50 for--good luck with that, suckers. I'm gonna have to pass until this issue is fixed."
1,DRM makes this unusable,"DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. You cannot buy it anyway, it is DRM'ed.I will not, repeat, will not install anything with DRM. DRM installs unknown software on my machine, monitors my use and causes unexplained crashes. Philosophically, DRM is garbage. After paying money for a product, I would like to use it as I please, install it on any machine I choose, and make backup copies if I feel like it. I do not need someone to monitor me or lay claim to what's inside my house.Until software marketers learn that when you sell something you actually have to give it to the buyer, no one should buy their software."
1,"Way to screw up what promised to be a great game, EA.",The most anticipated game in years. How do you mess it up? Turn video game buying into video game *renting*.Way to go EA.
1,"Nice game, VERY BAD restrictions","Spore is a very nice game and I enjoyed it. There is a clear downside though: the DRM is VERY restrictive. you are only allowed to install the game 3 times, once you have installed it that many times you have to buy a new copy. Do NOT buy this game, not even as a gift to your enemies. (Seriously though: don't buy it).Also you have to install the EA download manager, a very shady program which is required to play online and download patches. Why you need an additional spyware-like program to do so is beyond me."
1,DRM is a no go.,"I'm sorry EA, I would most likely have purchased this game if it weren't for your DRM. I hope you learn your lesson on this one."
1,Horrible DRM stops the show for an otherwise good game.,"EA came out with a great product here. Unfortunately, the inexcusabely invasive DRM software Securom included with the game makes purchasing it a bad deal. Avoid this until EA changes its policies on DRM."
1,Boycott EA and their junk DRM,"This game and all other EA games coming out from here on out come with at Crappy DRM Securom that will screw up your system and limit the amount of times you can install the game. So if you get a new hard drive, video card or any other device then you will be in trouble. Let EA know how stupid they are."
1,drm makes me a sad panda,"probably one of the most innovative and well-executed games released in the last 20 years, but the ridiculous DRM means that you are either stuck off-line and lose out on the revolutionary MSO (massively single-player online) experience, or you rent 3 uses for $50 USD.will wright is an undeniable genius and its sad that the evil empire known as EA is prevent his incredible achievement from having higher market penetration."
2,Hype inversely proportional to quality once again,"Although Spore is initially quite impressive, given the novelty of such extensive use of user-designed content, the game quickly becomes disappointing. Creature design (vehicles and buildings also) is essentially cosmetic, aside from a few minor effects in one stage of the game. The game itself, rather than being a single, coherent experience, is divided into 5 mini games (stress on mini), each of which feels very incomplete. On the second or third time playing through, gameplay becomes very formulaic, like playing solitaire without shuffling. I never expect a game to live up to the hype (especially this much hype) but Spore doesn't even come close. Maybe Maxis plans to make us buy half a dozen expansions before the game is worth the base $50 price (see Sims)."
1,"I left buying EA games years ago, this is just one reason why...",I loved EA back in it's heyday - before they became a fat faceless white man behind a desk. Haven't purchased an EA game for over three years and proud of it. This is just another $50 they're not getting from me - or anyone else on this list of reviews it seems :) Game companies need to find other ways to combat piracy - this type of trash is not how to do it. Down with EA!!!!
1,"Interesting, but not worth paying for","I love SimCity and the Sims and was looking forward to this game for a long time. Unfortunately, this game is nothing like the game that we had hoped for. Each of the different phases of the game are interesting, but none of them is worth playing more than one or two times. I've had the game a week and I'm already tired of it. It was not worth paying $50 for.UPDATE: My nine year old son LOVES this game."
1,DRM no thanks,I HAVE NOT PLAYED THIS GAME.Because I haven't bought it. I don't agree with the DRM restrictions so I'm going to live without Spore.
1,Will not buy crippleware,"DRM makes buying this game the equivalent to a rental, but without the rental price.Once this game gets below $20 it might be worth putting up with it, but until then no."
1,Frisbee anyone?,"I absolutely cannot believe I have been waiting impatiently for three years to rent a dumbed-down moron version of what could have been a great game at a cost of $50. EA, Will Wright: if you persist in treating your customers like dolts, then me and I'm sure many like me can find much better use of our cash."
1,Valid Concerns,"At no time is this game tangibly your own; it has a ridiculously heavy-handed 3 install limit, meaning you are out of luck if you reformat often or buy new systems. This is on a totally different level than Apple's Fairplay DRM, which authorizes 5 systems and allows you to change these systems easily. Not to mention the game is far from a true evolution sim; a modern remake of Sim Earth would have proven much more interesting."
1,If I Could Give it Zero Stars,Rarely have I been so disappointed in a game than I was with Spore. It's neither interesting to play nor even very fun. The graphics remind me of games I played 10 years ago. I expect more from a company that's given us so many great games. Caveat emptor.
1,"Decent game, extremely poor DRM","While Spore fails to hit many of the expectations it created, the game is still somewhat innovative and is fun to play. This is all for naught due to the fact that you can only install the game three times, also leaving you at the mercy of EA's activation servers. If those servers were to go down, you would be out of luck if you wanted to play the game.I installed this game on my PC, thats one install. I installed it on my laptop, that's another. That leaves me one install remaining. If I change my hardware configuration and format either platform (something I do every year or so) I'll use up my final install and be forced to pay for the game again.This is simply unacceptable. EA, this is the final straw. No more games from a broken publisher."
1,poor ea,ea are smoking something chronic if they didnt see any kind of reaction to this game. you should be able to give this game a zero star rating for its useless ness.
3,Nothing groundbreaking here,"Spore is not something revolutionary by any means. Here are the new things, which I will call pros.Pros:1. Several different games of different genres in one.2. You get to design your own vehicles, physical appearance and buildings. At times, your performance in the game depends on what you select and how you design your creature.Cons:1. 4 out of 5 games in Spore are weak, repetitive and boring. They are retarded versions of normal games of corresponding genres. I cannot tell for the last one - interstellar, because I've never played space trade games before. Chances are it is c.r.ap.p.y as well.2. In most cases designing your stuff is useless, it is just for looks. But it is still required! You have to waste time picking appearance of structures or vehicles which will not matter a bit in the end!Summary: Spore does not live up to expectations. Not even to expectations of a normal strategy game. After checking all the stuff out, you might just get bored and stop playing."
3,A Non-DRM Review,"I played this game for a bit and wasn't really impressed. The first stages are nothing more than devour as much food as you can before getting eaten by something else bigger than you.Later in the game things shape up to be more interesting, specifically the civilization stage. The problem is that it is an RTS with microscopic units because your planet is undeniably huge. Finally the Space Age, is where you zip around the cosmos dropping colonies all over and if it interests you, destroying planets by instigating global warming.The good parts; you can customize your creations to staggering degrees. Even the vehicles do not necessarily need to be ""connected"" (literally you can have nothing but air between the bottom of your car's chassis and the wheels).If you enjoy a game where it is purely customization and a small bit of action in between this game fits the bill perfectly. It's easy to pick up and easy to enjoy if you've nothing better to do."
1,DRM is bad for software,Unfortunately this game is distributed crippled by draconian DRM restrictions. As a result I have cancelled my preorder and will not be purchasing it.
1,I'll add my voice to the choir,I had been looking forward to buying this game but the DRM is a deal breaker. I probably reformat my hard drive three times a year for one reason or another. And then I'm expected to beg for another install? It's not like these license servers last forever either. Look at what just happened to Yahoo and Microsoft music. When it is no longer profitable the end user always gets left holding the bag. Either you're selling me the game or not EA. You can't have it both ways.
1,screw you EA!,"I will boycott your products. I don't care how good they are anymore. congratulations, jerks."
1,Maelstrom of Malcontent,"And PC game publishers wonder why PC gaming is dying and consoles are taking over...Nice bone-headed move, EA. Nice... I have been really looking forward to this one, and now I come here and see the flood of angry protests over what looks to be only a mediocre game and DRM added on as a slap in the face to all your customers.No thanks."
1,DRM messed up my virus scanner,"Since installing this game, Windows Vista keeps telling me I do not have a Virus Scanner installed. I have the latest version of McAfee and Vista correctly identified it until I installed this game. I have read on several blogs that this is a known issue with the software EA uses to protect the game."
1,Another EA mistake!,Another EA Mistake.Another developer that won't have a future for partnering with EA.Broken DRM and false claims of multiple accounts/users will keep me from buying a game I have been following since its first introduction video.
1,Horrible DRM,I wonder if the software developers use the same version of this game when they play it. Somehow I can't imagine that they do because I can't imagine someone subjecting their computer to this sort of assault intentionally.
1,Still requires Internet access,"After I bought Creature Creator (the Spore demo), I felt that I had both been suckered out of ten dollars and set up to cause my son disappointment because he couldn't install the game (it requires Internet access to install, and he doesn't have it at his Mom's house).I almost fell for it again, this time for fifty bucks, because of rumors that Spore wouldn't have the same limitation. Not a peep from EA on the product page. Selling an unreturnable, restricted product without disclosing the restriction before the sale is an unethical business practice."
1,DRM? No thanks.,"I'm sure this game is a lot of fun. I've been looking forward to it for quite some time now. However, I'm not a big fan of having a DRM rootkit on my PC forcibly installed and sucking up my resources, and so I decided to pass on it.There's also the issue that I'd like to play it on a PC that doesn't have an active internet connection, and again, thanks to the DRM, this is not possible.Don't pay this insane price to RENT this game. You guys took a potentially excellent game and took a big old dump on it.DO NOT BUY THIS GAME IF YOU DON'T WANT A DRM ROOTKIT FORCIBLY INSTALLED ON YOUR PC THAT YOU CANNOT EASILY REMOVE. IT WILL BE SITTING IN THE BACKGROUND CONSTANTLY SUCKING UP YOUR RESOURCES AND COMMUNICATING WITH EA'S SERVER.Absolute GARBAGE."
1,Draconian DRM,"Fight the man, get rid of the terrible DRM commonplace in today's computer software. it does no good (tens of thousands of pirates have gotten this game through torrents) and only serves to inconvenience EA's actual customers. Show EA what you think by posting your own negative review here. Maybe they will get the point...I for one WOULD BUY THIS GAME, but only when the DRM is gone. Until then, there are plenty of non DRM'ed games out there."
1,DRM is Lame,"The 3 installation requirement is lame and hurts the consumer not software pirates. It's a shame that they had to ruin this game with the stupid drm requirements. I did buy the game and I think it deserves 1 star because of the DRM included with it. I've spent thousands on Amazon over the years, but I've never written a review until now. I also have been waiting for spore for years and years."
1,Love the Sim Games,"I've been an avid fan of sim games in general and was really looking forward to Spore but the included DRM ""feature"" just kills it for me. I've made the the mistake of thinking that since I didn't pirate the game the DRM wouldn't effect me one too many times (Neverwinter Nights 2 I'm looking at you). I just can't imagine purchasing a game with an installed DRM component or excessive limitations on use. I hope that EA reconsiders so that I can buy what looks like a truly wonderful game."
2,"end DRM, dont buy this product",the game may be worth purchasing if your a sims fan. its a digital Mr patatohead man crossed with free-to-play internet arcade games. those looking for more engaging gameplay however will be disapointed.
1,DRM killed the videogame star,"Its sad to see a gaming genius like Will Wright allow his brainchild to be bastardized by such invasive DRM. Imagine if the great masterpieces of the world were all bridled by such restrictions, what a world that would be. This is the first major volley fired by conglomerates that see to control what we play, watch, hear and think."
1,Will they ever get the point?,"Game = fun (for the 40 minutes I've dedicated to it so far)EA = not fun (enough can go wrong without their phone home root kits)This game was cracked and available last week. They cripple the people that purchase their game ""to protect from piracy"" The pirates are the only ones playing it hassle free...I had preordered a while back and never bothered to check if they were gonna use any DRM as I wouldn't expect anyone to do something as dumb as what EA did.Unfortunately I found out to late. I'll just get the reload if they don't patch it out. Could have just canceled my order and reloaded it last week. Sucks to be EA(again)."
1,DRM sucks,"Only 3 installs? I don't care how good a game is, overly restrictive DRM ruins it.I pre-ordered the game from amazon, but I am going to return it unopened unless EA does something about this DRM nightmare.Sorry Will Wright, you picked the wrong publisher."
1,Got the message?,"Gott the message? DRM is bad for consumers and big business alike. No company can thrive while it's mocking it's consumers. DRM does that, it spits in my face. Why do you spit in my face, EA?Examples of all that is wrong etically and moraly i long, but in real life? Here is one of the latest with DRM issues, and not getting answers from EA.... http://www.crymod.com/thread.php?threadid=34805"
1,Another EA release to stay away from,"Yet again EA has dropped the ball. Not only do they treat their employees terribly (see http://news.cnet.com/Electronic-Arts-settles-overtime-suit/2110-1047_3-6065011.html ), but they also treat their customers like criminals right from the start when they release games like Spore that are almost unplayable even for legitimate purchasers of the game, due to the massive amount of DRM (Digital Rights Management) in the game. EA only thinks about making profits and doesn't care about releasing a good game. Too bad Will Wright didn't go to a different publishing company, Spore might have been a good game. As it is, don't buy this because you will spend so much time being pestered by DRM that you won't have any time to enjoy the game itself."
1,Not Again!,When will this stop! This is the second game this summer I've refused to buy because of DRM. Wake up PC gaming industry! Stop crippling your games. I want to buy this game. I want to own this game. I want to be able to play my game whenever I want. I will pay full price for this. But I will pay nothing when you put this crap in your games. People wonder why the PC gaming market is declining. This must be part of the reason.
1,Securom DRM Alert,"This program uses the onerous Securom DRM which limits the number of times you install your program to 3 times, and does not provide a mechanism to de-install Securom. Caveat emptor."
2,DRM is the least of Spore's problems,"Forget the DRM, the game simply does not live up to its hype or its good element: the creature editor. If you enjoyed the creator, which I did and still do, beware of buying the full game. This has been my biggest disappointment with a major game release in several years. If the creator hadn't been so good I would not have pre-ordered and now I feel conned. The gameplay is very shallow and often annoying, especially when combined with some odd control and camera idiosycracies."
1,Don't buy this game.,"I just wanted to add my two cents, and negative ratings, to the other 2000+ already here.If you buy this you are effectively letting EA walk all over you. You're paying them $50 so you can rent a game. As someone who has owned all the sims and the sims 2 games to date, trust me in saying those limited activations will be spent in no time and you'll be forced to either play with a bugged game, re-purchase the game, or not play at all.Securom I wouldn't touched with a ten foot pole. I suggest reading up on it and you'll be equally enraged that anyone, much less a company you gave your hard earned money to would dare to put such a thing on your PC.I was looking forward to spore and even the sims 3. I will purchase neither on principle. EA is doing a major disservice to it's customers, and they will hear you best if it effects their sales. So take a stand with your wallet, and don't buy this game."
5,Jzzzzz....get over the DRM thing,"The DRM does not ruin the experience of the game. The zero star is because people hate DRM so do I but you don't need to protest like a bunch of babies. My two kids absolutely love this game even I a father of two think it is really fun especially the space stage. The best part of this game is once you've played all stages you can start a new game at any stage. Plus the variety of creatures, buildings, vehicles, star ships is absolutely incredible. Don't let a bunch of screaming babies impact your decision....try the game if you can and then judge. Great job maxis!"
1,Can't get it to install,"I have a combo DVD-RAM/DVD+-RW reader/writer drive, and all it keeps saying is ""unsupported drive""Why? I've never had a problem with it before. I searched the net and I have to assume it's the stupid copy protection. I finally had to return the game for a refund."
1,DMR... no thanks.,Joining the protest! I am getting sick of the over the top protection schemes companies feel the need to shove down a legit customer's throat.
2,Spore = Bore,"The first two stages of the game are great. In fact its the only unique part of this game. After that it turns into a boring rts game. All the hype and previews over this game were just lies. I feel like i was taken for a ride on this one. And to make matters worse,the camera angles and controls are awful in the rts stages. I even wasted money on a guide. Don't buy this game if your thinking it will be something different. And now with the first patch,the sound is all screwed up. I uninstalled it and wish i could at least send it back."
4,From a single celled organism to infinity and beyond..,"Awesome game, once you get pass the DRM, which sadly may seriously kill sales of what otherwise is a fun and fascinating game with an underlying hint of real science."
1,DRM is a deal breaker,"This game seems very interesting, but there's no way that I'm going to turn over $50 for such crippling DRM. I'm not going to do business with a company that treats its customers like crooks."
1,A unreliable game - crashes very often,"I have tried to play this game. The most I have managed to play was maybe two hours and then the game will crash and all progress is lost. This happend to me 4 times in one dayThe loading process is very slow and I have never seen a ""Do you want to continue were the game crashed"" message. Very frustratingThe ""new parts"" that you can use to upgrade your creature can get very monotonous, many parts have the same characteristics and only a very slightly difference en in appereanceGraphics quality seems to be 5 or 10 years old. Very frustrating after all the expectationThe game is son unreliable to play that is not even good to give to someone as a GIFTDon't buy this terrible game."
1,Fatal Flaw,Such problems with this game! Due to the nature of my career I change my computer configuration a lot. Got bit hard by the DRM on this. 3 installs and now I can't play any more.Why am I being punished for purchasing the game rather than pirating it. Those guys don't have this penalty!
1,DRM sucks :),"Simple quick review.I am a PC enthusiast. I upgrade my pc's alot as well as format a few times a year, just to get some performance boosts. What does this mean?Spore only allows you to install it a certain amount of times before you have to start jumping through hoops of fire in order to play the game. I can't jump well and don't like fire... staying away"
1,SecuROM is Outrageous,"SecuROM is a huge security risk. It sits in the background running as an administrator, thereby bypassing the most basic security best practice of running software using a lesser privileged account. How long until someone finds a way to hack into SecuROM and use it as a rootkit? Given that the game has already been cracked, probably not long.Protest with your wallets. Don't buy spore until EA removes SecuROM."
1,DRM - Manage This,"Spore looked like it'd be great fun, and I loved the marketing leading up to the launch (Creatures reacted by famous people, for instance), but the DRM makes it a no-go. Simply put, there's no way I'll pay $50 for a game that requires external authority. I feel offended as a consumer that EA feels they can treat me like dirt and expect me to still play their games. Just being activated externally is bad enough, but to limit it to three is adding insult to injury. I frequently replay games from years past for the fun of it, and knowing I'm buying the game to play through maybe once more means its a game I won't buy.Additionally, I wouldn't even ever pick this up used, since it may not have activations left. Just shoddy management all around."
1,Into the Fray,"I was so excited, like everyone else it seems. And now, I'm not buying. And for people who seem to support DRM, please understand that it may not have an immediate impact on your computer. There are long term issues associated with it that make it a threat to the very stability of your system. Ignorance does not make the problem go away.I applaud everyone who is finally standing up to the corporations and saying that we aren't taking this anymore. What we purchase is ours."
1,Put off by DRM,"What a disappointment! I am an avid gamer and was really looking forward to playing this game, but I will go out of my way to avoid DRM'd ""rubbish""! (I've been burned before by limited activation schemes.)"
1,EA Needs to Get Over Themselves,"When I go to a store and purchase a sofa, the store doesn't tell me that I can only sit on it 3 times. I don't have to call in to a service center to request that I can wear it one more time.Fact is: you do NOT own my computer, EA. If I buy your crappy software, you do not have the right to control what I do on my PC. As far as I'm concerned, you can shove this, and your future releases up your arse."
1,"Say ""No"" to DRM!","I played Spore on a friend's PC and it is pretty good, and while I'd love to purchase it, I refuse to until there is a DRM-Free version."
1,Don't buy until they're willing to sell it to you. For real.,A great game by a great designer that's been reduced to a bad industry joke by the crippling DRM. Don't buy until they fix it.
1,"EA, feel the backlash!","I, like many other, was eagerly anticipating this game. However, after hearing about this ridiculous protection scheme, I've decided to wait till EA comes to their senses on this one....I'm sure it wont be long till the tidal wave of bad PR forces them to do so."
1,this is out of a Mission Impossible movie,"Hey, I have a great idea for EA to ""improve"" their DRM: how about if they put in a self destruct virus, so that if you install it more than 3 times it will erase your entire drive or better yet, make it go up in smoke!!! EA: get real. Like other reviewers, this is the first PC game I have been interested in for quite a while. Thanks for helping me see the error of my ways."
1,"Apparently I rented this game, not bought it","The REAL reason behind 3 total installs is so that it is a major pain in the caboose to resell the game. Game publishers are tired of us making money off of reselling games and people saving money buying used. This is their way of preventing us into never selling or buying used.EA couldn't make up their mind how to proceed with Spore. Is it a casual game, or hardcore? A mix of both? Well, the gameplay has suffered, as it is a series of minigames that are uninspiring, repetitive, and just not very fun at all.Ten years in the making doesn't mean anything when your core focus is to make money via expansions, ala The Sims. It looks like the investors of EA ruined this game, and the developers let it be ruined. It's sad."
1,Game not worth the DRM,"The game is decent enough, however as a consumer i cannot purchase something that has been DRM'd to death like this. Mass Effect, Bioshock and now Spore ... the DRM doesn't stop ANYONE from pirating the game and it takes away from the game for the everyday consumer like me. I'll go back to playing my classic DRM free PC games. Thanks, but no thanks!"
1,Boring,"Despite a good idea for a game, the producers didn't manage to create a good one. I am really disappointed with this game. I just played once, the stages are very repetitive, and the last part is extremely boring. The majority of the parts that you put in your creatures are just cosmetics..."
1,Going back as soon as I get it.,"I preordered this game through Amazon a couple of weeks ago, and unfortunately I didn't really take notice of the DRM implemented into this game. Since Amazon shipped it out before I took note I was unable to cancel my order beforehand. Based on personal research and reading this forum as soon as USPS delivers this puppy it's going back (must remember not to open said software box). If EA takes note of this DRM nightmare and fixes it, maybe I'll consider reordering. Until such time my $50 is better spent elsewhere, perhaps on some blank writable media."
1,DRM ruins the game,I was very excited for this game to hit the shelves and pick up a copy but after learning of the DRM used by EA I will be passing on this one. If it gets removed I will then purchase it.I have Windows XP right now and will most likely upgrade within the next few months or so which would eat up 2 of the 3 installs right off the bat. I will not buy a game under those terms and will take my money elsewhere in the meantime.
1,DRM destroyed it,"DRM started this game out badly. I have to call EA for permission to install the game on my computer?! I had problems installing it on an older computer, so when I finally got a decent one, I had to make phone calls. Its easy enough to get additional permission, but its very inconvenient, and considering I was one of the suckers that bought the game at full price when it was new, I feel screwed!I will not buy any Spore games ever again, and I'll do my best to avoid EA games as well. Jerks."
1,Not with my money,I was so excited about this game - then I read the details!There is no way in the world that I am paying for a game that won't last long enough for me to play it properly!I have needed to re-install Windows twice so far in the last two weeks (we all know that this happens sometimes!) and even Microsoft recommend that for best performance Windows should be re-installed regularly.
1,Saving my money,"Wow! Before I read these reviews I'd never even heard of DRM. I had a funny feeling about Spore which is why I waited to purchase it. Thank heavens for women's intuition! I'll save my money for the game I really want which is Sims 3. I'm really hoping EA doesn't make the same mistake with the next Sims release. Just to be safe though, I'll probably wait until after reviews for Sims 3 before I buy."
1,Another lost sale due to DRM,I was going to buy this game but refuse to support any game or product with this sort of DRM
1,waste of time,"go right now at look at past videos of spore in development. the game looks amazing right? Looks like the best game ever.well something happened from then to now, cause the game looks,feels,and plays like none of those videos.the game plays like a demo, its very unfinished.Do not buy this game"
1,No Spore for Vista?,"So I've now tried for hours to get this game working on my system and it hasn't worked. The DRM garbage worked and it installed, but it crashes when I actually get into the game. Support told me to un-install and re-install, which didn't work and we installed it on my wife's laptop, which also didn't work.So now I've used up all 3 copies of the DRM assigned installs, and I have no working version. Thanks EA."
1,DRM is bad for gaming,"Game is already pirated before launch. So only legitimate, legal purchasers suffer from DRM.Plus - what happens in say 5 years when I decide I want to play that game I loved in 2008? (As I have previously with other old games). Will the servers still be around to authenticate - and will EA still be interested if I have passed the 3 install limit? Will EA even still exist.What happens if I don't like the game and want to sell it on?Only buy if you are only interested in the game for the short term."
1,DRM begs me to pirate the game,"I was going to buy this game, then I discovered I'd only be able to install it a max of 3 times ever. I am a hardcore gamer and upgrade my computer regularly, this means after about 2 years I would no longer be able to play this game.Leaves me little choice but to pirate spore if I want to play it after 2 years. And if I going to one day pirate it, might as well start from the begging and save some coin."
1,Disappointed,"I was coming online to buy a copy of this game, but after reading the reviews about DRM and only 3 installs I decided not to buy it. I know for a fact I will have to reinstall my XP and Vista numerous times (have had plenty of exp so I know) which means it wont be long before I am screwed. I am cutting my losses up front this time. Thanks for all those posting about the limitation so quickly. I will not even get the chance to see if the limitations built into the game affect the enjoyment I might have had."
1,DRM,"Unfortunately, when a product limits your installs to 3 (god forbid you format your computer or use your laptop) it makes it impossible to use the product you pay for. Spore has done this. It is impossible to buy."
1,DRM fail,"Since 2005, I haven't bought a single Sony product. Looks like I'll have to adopt a similar stance for EA & Maxis. Seriously, guys, how could you do this? Spore is the most anticipated game in a decade. Every nerd on the planet wanted to buy a copy. When will you learn?"
1,The DRM Makes It Not Worth Owning.,Three installs before EA tears another $50 out of you if you want to play the game again.I'm already on two and the game has been out less than a week.Lovely.That aside the game isn't quite complete but the two completed parts (creature and final stage) are fun. I'd say wait till it hits bargain bin or steam it when you can.
1,I won't go near it.,"Given all the negative comments about the anti-piracy code that this game includes, I will not be buying it. As the music industry did, now so do game publishers...and I no longer buy from either. Treat your customers like criminals, and only criminals will be your customers."
1,DRM an absolute show stopper,"I rebuild my computer twice a year out of sheer necessity; its the only way to really remove any malware that creeps in past my Anti-virus software and firewalls. That means I have to re-buy the game in 18 months? Yeah, not gonna happen. NO DRM, or NO SALE!"
1,DRM completely ruins this title,"Don't bother buying this game, unless you're okay with the fact EA requires you to authenticate with their servers *every single time* you play. Not only that, but if you change your computer's hardware configuration you risk the chance of losing the entire license to this product. Too bad, the game's quite fun but the software enforcing its anti-piracy system renders this purchase useless. You'd be better off burning your money."
1,Three Letters,"I own several Sim games, but what EA is doing is preventing us from playing any more.The reason this game gets one star? Three letters . . .DRM.For this same reason, I no longer purchase music from iTunes--I even have loaded gift certificates that I've yet to cash in for two years. I buy all my music through Amazon's DRM-free MP3 Albums.Maybe EA will get the message. DRM has got to go or their customers will."
1,What did EA Games expect to happen?,"A digital rights management that allows a total of three installations? Well, you can install the game but you can't play it until you activate it online, and you can only do this three times. After that, the game is worthless. Even if you change anything in your computer like, say, adding a new video card to improve your system performance, this thing will demand to be activated again. I'd actually prefer SecuRom over this, or to register on-line every ten days (that was the original plan). I will be returning this game and if I see the EA Games logo on a game from now on, I will NOT be purchasing it. I hope Electronic Arts rots!"
1,DRM Sucks,"While the game is a bit cheesy and somewhat fun to play the entire use of DRM and crazy way the limit the installs to 3 times is nuts and hurts those of us that paid for the game. Until EA fixes it, I say skip it."
1,It seems Spore has carried a Virus with it.,"I just discovered about the DRM issue with Spore today, 2 days after buying it. While it's a great game. I think companies have no right to label their product in a way that would muddle the fact that it bears a virus. I own multiple computers(4 in this house) and like to take my games with me when I travel and play them at friends & family members' homes. How does a game with online capabilities benefit from restrictions that would generate an aversion to ever installing it again?Personally I would like an option to remove the DRM script from my computer. IF EA doesn't offer it I'm sure someone else will."
1,DRM -- you got to be kidding I'm not going to rent a game for 50 bucks,"Well, if EA thinks I'm going to shell out 50 dollars to basically rent a game for 3 installs, they better think again 'cause they aren't getting anymore of my cash."
1,DRM. No need to say more.,"The game was a decent bit of fun, but EA needs to be a taught a lesson in its production schemes. DRM does nothing to prevent copyright infringement and does everything to ruin the real consumer's experience. 3 installs? Come on."
1,"Game with a lot of potential, squandered due to the DRM","I was really looking forward to the game, and enjoyed the Creature Creator tremendously. I found out about the DRM (3 activations!) today. For many of us, machine rebuilds are a frequent fact of life for various reasons. I'm a bit disappointed that I'll have to install their spyware authenticator every time, not to mention calling to get the activations extended over and over.I received the shipping notification before I found out about the DRM. I'll definitely be returning the game until I see that the DRM has been removed."
2,Installing hasn't worked so far....,"Can't rate the game itself because we can't get it to install.....My son was very excited to install this in our MacBook Pro. According to the information it should work. We installed it, installed a million updates and then tried to run it. It starts, you get the spore window and then it just disappears. Have to do more research, but so far we haven't been able to identify the problem. Old software, newer computer and operating system can be a problem, but if it isn't compatible, they should tell you. If there is more you need to do, they should have that information available on their website.My son is NOT satisfied with this product thus far. I'll see how much time I have to devote to installation in the next day or two."
1,Spore,"Pro*color graphics*interesting characters*fast shipping from amazon.....Con*Security feature. I do not have internet and if I buy the game I should be able to own it, not rent it.*The game is dumbed down way too much in almost all aspects. It strives to be an RTS but fails, civ builder but fails, etc. etc. It needs to make up its mind what it wants to be in each stage and expand upon it. Right now its like just a sample flavor of what that genre is but leaves you desiring a whole lot more.*Evolution is pointless. Also you should see the other animals evolve with you but at each stage they do not carry over.I'd avoid this software like the plague until two things happen:1) The re-release the software with a patch that eliminates the DRM feature2) The software is discounted to 29.95$ or less"
1,"Cutesy game, hideous DRM","Spore is an innovative and visually stunning game. The early stages of the game are clearly engineered to make you get attached to your creatures so by the time you get to the later (and much more interesting) stages, you have more of an investment in your little interstellar empire. However, none of the the stages in the game are especially complex and won't tax a hard-core gamer.Sadly the game is crippled by the ridiculous DRM scheme that limits the number of installs you can make. Many users will legitimately find themselves stuck with an unplayable game after making changes or buying a new computer. The rationale for this awful DRM is hard to understand - it punishes legitimate customers, yet pirates are absolutely unaffected. This is a big reason NOT to buy this game until a patch is available that disables the DRM.On the plus side, Windows and Mac binaries are both on the same disc."
1,Dont Purchase due to draconian DRM,I would've purchased this game via amazon. Heard a lot of good things about it. But i will not be buying it due to the ridiculous DRM EA implemented. I want to purchase my games... not rent them.No thanks.
1,No thanks.,"Draconian DRM. 3 installs and you're done. How many times have you installed SimCity on your PC in all the years you've owned it? I've lost count but it's certainly more than 3.Do not 'rent' this over hyped game that falls short of any expectations you may have for it.Buy Sword of the Stars instead, it has the space stage that's the real meat of Spore's strategy gameplay and has no DRM."
1,Was ready to purchase Spore but will save my $$$...thanks!,"Like many reviewers here I came to Amazon tonight to purchase Spore; after reading about the DRM and ""dumbing down"" of the game I've decided not to. Maybe EA and the games industry will take some notice of the number of reviewers who would have purchased the game and have changed their minds - we are a very small percentage of the actual number of lost customers."
1,DRM? Count me out.,The DRM sounds draconian. The game is not worth looking at until the DRM is gone.
1,No DRM for me,I was utterly excited about this game until I found out about the DRM requirements. EA treating me like a criminal?No thank you.I'll won't even consider purchasing this title until EA wises up and removes the DRM. I upgrade and reinstall way too often to even think about purchasing a game that restricts me to such a paltry number of installations/activations.
1,DRM is no fun.,It's hard to see how a game with DRM like EA has infested on Spore could ever be worth more than one star.
1,The DRM means I will never purchase this game,"I will not buy this game. The DRM requirement is an insult. I buy about a dozen games as year, but I will not add this game to that list. EA you have lost a customer. I refuse to purchase any product sporting this draconian ""anti piracy"" measure.I ask all consumer out there to boycott EA until they stop treating their customer like potential criminals.Shame on you EA!!!"
1,DRM only hurts legit customers,"Having been burned by DRM in the past (I've had to use cracks on games I PURCHASED because of DRM compatibility issues) I support and will take part in this boycott. DRM does NOT prevent or punish piracy, but it does punish those who buy the game! The game was already available in the pirate channels before the release, so the DRM has failed and is now pointless. I'm thrilled to see this backlash against EA and DRM because if customers don't speak up they will continue this bad behavior and not connect the dots as to why sales are not as high as they expected."
1,Do NOT buy download version!,"I hate to pile on, but I wanted to make sure that no one else goes through the hassle that I did with the download version of Spore. I ponied up my money and waited forever for a download link to arrive--it never did.The combo of the absurd DRM and the 3-day wait for a software download purchased over the net make this perhaps the worst game release I have ever witnessed. The publisher's predatory attitude toward consumer rights is unacceptable and I would encourage anyone who reads this to avoid all EA products until such time as they stop installing malware on customers' computers."
1,Fun didn't last very long,"The game starts off very fun: creating, growing, surviving. The game takes you through different gameplay styles from 3rd person action adventure to RTS style gameplay. However, the missions remain the same and as you progress through the game it gets tedious and boring. 3 Stars for the game. 1 Star overall for the use of SecuRom."
1,Dissapointed,"I have lost faith in EA. This may be a great game, but it's crippled for fair use. The digital rights management of this software is not in the consumers' corner; not even close. Avoid this game and other EA products until they change their business practice."
1,"Bought it, regretted it.","I was super excited about this game for over a year before it came out. I could not wait. I rushed out to buy it right after leading worship service the Sunday it was released.But then I found out about the DRM. It broke my heart to hear that I could only install this game on '3' computers. I am the kind of guy who is constantly upgrading my computer which triggers another install credit. I know I will be left with no more installs in only a couple of years.I feel like I have rented this game, not purchased it. I now know to check for this kind of DRM before I buy an EA product. I WILL NOT spend my money on games with a built in expiration date. I encourage you to do the same."
1,I will not fund companies that treat me like a thief for purchasing!,DRM in general and this draconian DRM in particular only serves to punish legitimate buyers.I was very much looking forward to purchasing and playing Spore. I absolutely will not be purchasing this product until it is released without DRM. I purposely avoided Mass Effect PC for DRM reasons too.EA/Maxis (and any other game/media companies out there)--you're driving real customers away. Stop punishing legitimate customers! Especially since there are already methods out there to pirate Spore before it was even released!I just can't stand this blindness on the part of publishers!
1,Why Buy - DMA gone overboard!,"I feel cheated by the onerous DRM restrictions placed on my copy of Spore. Any gamer knows that 3 installs is nothing, and we all like to own a game when we buy it - as has always been the case. This new business model is going to kill EA unless they wake up to our needs and expectations and respect the users. There are plenty of users that buy the game, despite piracy. Who in their right mind is going to buy a game that has been panned by 90% of the users here on Amazon? I hope EA is learning from their obvious huge mistake. I like EA's past contributions, but this is ridiculous."
1,A Major Mac OS X release! But... not if it means DRM,"I was really looking forward to this, as one of the few major games to have parallel release for the Mac.Unfortunately, DRM has a tendency to break subsequent versions of the system services (sometimes on minor releases, often on major releases) on the Mac. Since I like to play games like this for years, there's no way I'm going to buy into something that is likely to screw around with my OS.Sorry, I'll be happy to buy and review this game and not the DRM once I can get the game and not the DRM.DRM makes software too difficult to deal with, I'm not buying DRMed software, even games, any more - I can choose other products that don't interfere with the functioning of my own computer."
3,Meh,"For such a grandiose concept, this is actually a fairly dull game. The creature creators are great fun, but the actual game play loses it's charm after the first two levels. It was a great idea, but it failed in execution. Wait til this one is on sale."
1,So my son can't play?,"If I buy this for $50 my son can't play if I create an account. Stupid.Please do not buy this, send a message to EA by hitting them in the wallet.Let's hope a class action lawsuit is in order due for those who did to what was promised before release and even printed in the instruction manual."
2,"A mile wide, an inch deep","Widely hyped and highly anticipated, Spore turned out to be a fairly large letdown for me. While the premise of guiding a civilization from the cellular stage all the way to space faring is excellent, the gameplay is largely simplistic, repetitive, and boring.Casual gamers may very well enjoy it, but it's not likely to hold the more hardcore contingent's interest."
1,Since my first was removed,"Since my first negative review was removed, I ma-... Wait just a moment. Let me say that again.My first negative review was removed.Odd, that. It was one of the top five reviews.Anyway, since my first was removed, I figured I may as well make a second.Yada yada, Draconian DRM, yada yada evil, and general wish that I could purchase this game, but inability to actually purchase the game as it's rentware, etc.Censored. Huh. Wonder when the rest of us will get silenced?"
1,One word: SecuROM,"I could rattle on endlessly about how quickly I lost interest in Spore, its limited overall strategies (aggressive, or passive), the tendency of past decisions to pigeonhole you into a single strategy, the lack of depth of any kind except for what your units look like, or any degree of gameplay complexity that might require forethought or skill, etc, etc, etc, but that would all just make it a mediocre game, not a terrible one.(...)"
1,"LadyM, maybe you should pay better attention","Let's see if you feel the same way when, in five years, you upgrade to a new system again and you can't install the game anymore because EA has retired the activation server for it. Suddenly, the game you supposedly OWN is worthless. Would you still give it five stars then?"
1,Yawn and uninstall,This product was BOOOORRRRIIING I beat it in less than a day And my comp ran like hammered dog food after I installed it :P
2,just not good,"Many of the people reviewing this game are mad about the DRM. And many are disappointed that the game was changed considerably from the trailers the designer showed during the years the game was being developed. That's why they rated the game as one of the worse ever.However if you just look at the game itself, forgetting about the DRM and the hopes some people had for the game, what you find is a game that's just not good.The game gives you very few options during each stage. Or at least very few options that are meaningful. You can change the way you look but the way you look has little to no effect on game play. Much of the game play is forced and gets old quickly. The computer controlled creatures never do anything interesting or surprising, but that's mostly because they never do anything.As other reviewers have said you can find better games for free on the web."
1,Purchase at your own risk,"The game itself, when it use to work, was average. Nothing too spectacular once you get over the creature creator. In short, the meat of the game is the creativity offered in the create a creature mode. Other than that the games that your creature occupies is a very simplistic. Most everyting is cosmetic in terms of how you equip your creature and how the gameplay differs.WARNING: I built a new computer and now the game fails to registers due to the insane digital rights manamgent. The game is essentially worthless. Then again, given the gameplay, it isn't a huge loss. This software sets a very bad precedent in terms of people who are honest and pay good money for games. As a gamer, I purchase several titles a month on various platforms. I will not purchase anymore Maxis titles until I can confirm there is no DRM scheme that treats me like a criminal."
1,DRM is a deal breaker,this game will lend itself to death by drm. the only people who will be able to enjoy this game is the pirates.
1,an infectious spore,"I don't own Spore, I didn't pirate it, I haven't played it, but looking at what is required of the consumer to prove that they've earned the OPPORTUNITY, not the RIGHT to play EA's newest game from Maxis, I have no intention of doing any of those things.Shame on you EA, and shame on anyone else who thinks this system works."
1,SecuROM a major disappointment,"Well here I am on a day when Spore is finally, finally available for purchase. I have been waiting with intense excitement for well over a year for this game to come out. From the moment I first heard about it I knew it would be amazing and that I would have to have it. And then SecuROM came along.EA, you had me at hello with this game. My $50 was already in your pocket. But letting SecuROM gunk up my PC is far too high a price to pay for a game that may or may not be useless tomorrow. My money can still be yours, but I won't be paying a cent until this awful DRM is gone. Don't you see what's happening here? No one wins. We all lose."
1,"Fun game, but terrible DRM","The DRM for this game is utter nonsense, especially since you have to take the game online to really get the most out of it. I am playing a game that phones home every time I turn it on to get content (this I am ok with) but I can only install it three times ever? Baloney.The game itself is fun. The DRM is going to do more to encourage piracy than to prevent it."
1,HUGE disappointment,"Honestly, I was pretty excited about Spore. I got my copy, installed it, then went to go register for online play, only to have EA tell me that my never-been-used key is ""invalid."" So now I can't even use all of the product that I paid for. I'd return the damn thing if I could, but I've obviously broken the seal on the box.Do yourself a favor and just pirate the thing and save yourself $50."
1,DRM? No thanks,I simply will not buy a DRMed game for my computer. I'd rather wait for a console version.
1,DRM = nty,I am pleased that the local game store was too wrapped up in pre-orders for me to get a copy of Spore this morning. I am also pleased that I came on amazon to see the ammount of 1 star ratings that have been posted since the games release. I want to own a copy of the games a purchase and the DMR essentially prevents that. Thanks for the poor reviews.
1,Crippling DRM ruins the experience,"I'm done buying games that treat consumers like thieves and ruin my gaming experience because of the paranoia of greedy companies.When playing the pirate version is a better experience than playing the original game, something is very, very wrong.Wait for a DRM-free version or get the pirate one. EA must be sent a clear message that enough is enough."
1,DON'T BUY You will be sorry.,"""Forget this one. I tried to install this on my laptop and it came up with errors. Uninstalled and tried again to install and had the same problems. Gave it one more try and still got errors trying to play. Maybe my laptop would not handle it. Then I tried to install it on my desktop this time I could not activate it, It has some kind of protection on it. So here I am with a $50.00 game and cant play it. What gives. This copy protection makes me think I cant do what I want with my $50.00 program. (I guess they have locked my copy). NOW WHAT? This was a lot of money for a piece of junk!"
1,EA should brace for lawsuits,"No company or individual has the right to install a rootkit on your computer without your permission and communicate with their servers without your knowledge. It'd be alright if they came out and told people what they were doing, but they didn't. You install the game and you've installed a corporate virus. It's just wrong, and if the Sony situation is any indication, EA can look forward to some bad publicity and legal trouble."
1,Another lost customer,"This is a game I will never play, although I have a computer capable of playing it and the income to easily afford it.Ignoring the fact that by and large, Spore is getting extremely ""meh"" reactions, I refuse to be victimized for my patronage. Namely, the clunky and pointless DRM strapped on the game. I believe that when I purchase a product, I am entitled to use it however I want, as long as I want, for the lifetime of the product. I should not be subject to the whims of another company and should not hope the activation servers are around when I want to play it.Only buy this game if you enjoy Bejeweled and don't mind being a loyal victim instead of a loyal customer."
1,I refuse to buy,Throwing in my support against securom. I've legally purchased a good ten PC games in the past month but none of them restrict when I can play them. As a FULL RETAIL PRODUCT this fails. I refuse to put software on my computer that behaves similar to a rootkit.
1,Another signature on the DRM petition,"These reviews are more like signatures on an anti-DRM petition, rather than judging the game, so they may not be entirely fair. However, EA needs to get the message that DRM is unacceptable and unfair. Like anything else in life, crooks will always find a way around safeguards. EA needs to learn their lesson. We, their customers, dedicated gamers, will not stand for this nonsense."
1,No Play? No Fun.,"I refuse to buy anything with such DRM issues. The game industry can feel however it wants, but it's not getting my money. I'm not going to bother getting this game, no matter how hyped up it is: DRM ruins media, and it's ruined something that could have been quite good otherwise.If DRM exists to protect those who honestly purchase a game, why is it that the only ones that suffer are the ones that do not wish to infringe copyright? Why are -we- stuck with the horrible playability issues and bugs and rootkits while the pirates go around doing their jolly little dance, because they just crack it?"
1,DRM is lame and EA's to blame.,"I've been paying for and playing EA games for over two decades now. I'm sick and tired of the larger publishers forcing these Draconian measures to combat piracy on lawful paying customers. There has to be a better way. See Stardock's Gamer's Bill of Rights, please. No SPORE for this gamer."
1,DRM Lame,Don't support DRM that hurts the consumer. Avoid at all costs and spend hard earned money on companies that don't treat their customers like thieves.
1,I refuse to buy this game,"I refuse to purchase this game as long as the publisher insists on treating their paying customers like criminals.The publisher of the game requires an online activation which you can only perform 3 times before calling to beg for an additional activation. Why would you need to activate more than once?* You got a new computer* Your hard drive crashed* You uninstalled the game and decided to reinstall* You reinstalled windows* Your computer was stolenThese are all good reasons to reinstall the game and, thus, require reactivation. These are not reasons to treat your customers like software pirates!"
1,No thanks...,Not buying the game until a new DRM scheme is introduced. I want to OWN my own copy of Spore.
1,A quick return for me.,"I pre-ordered this game a long time ago and have waited for what I am sure is a pretty good game. However, now that I know about the DRM I will return the game as soon as it gets delivered. I routinely uninstall and reinstall games over many years. I play until I beat the game or get tired, then let some time pass until I pick it back up again. With this new DRM system, I can no longer do that. The game will stop working at some point because I've reached their limit of 3 installs or because they go through another round of server shutdowns and remove the activation server.I'm sure the game will be great, but I will return the game when it comes in. If they remove the DRM I will consider buying it then. As for other EA games, I will never buy another one that contains DRM."
1,I'm dissapointed...,"When I saw this pop up on pirate websites the other day I thought to myself, no! I will not download such an amazing game. Piracy is killing the industry and I don't want to support something that might hurt the creation of other great games in the future.But then I came to amazon and hear that they've applied this ridiculous DRM. After dealing with the headache that was mass effect I will not be tricked into buying such a piece of trash again."
1,Very Disappointed,This is the first computer game that I have gotten in years. It was a pleasure to play it for a couple of weeks. I installed the game on my laptop and desktop. After reinstalling the OS on my desktop and getting a new hard drive in my laptop after the old one took a dump I tried to reinstall the game. No good. After the installation limit of 3 was reached the DRM took over and now the game will not even open with my registration code. I even contacted EA and they were of no help. It is quite disappointing that a paying customer cannot play the game they purchased. Don't waste your money!
1,Just say NO to DRM,"When are the software and music recording companies going to start treating consumers with respect, and not like criminals? We've been excited about this game for over a year, and went to Amazon today (release day) ready to buy, but there is NO WAY we're going to support this further erosion of our rights. $50 and we don't even own the game? Plus unwanted rootkit software? No thanks, EA."
1,DRM is a pain.,"As a person that works in the I.T. field, I often wipe and reinstall my computer's operating system. Having DRM with an activation limit killed any thoughts I had of buying this game for a friend, which they were really looking forward to. Many other developers have successfully protected their games without being a major pain - look at the Steam platform, for example - I can take my games anywhere with it."
1,Not Buying until DRM is gone,"I would love to own this game. I'm not buying it, though, until the DRM is gone, or at least made reasonable and non intrusive and easily dealt with. I bought BioShock the first week it was released, but I STILL haven't been able to play because of the DRM."
1,"This game is crap. Don't buy it, and tell your friends and everyone you know not to buy it either","Spore is the perfect example of corporatisation destroying creativity and innovation. Where we could have had a deep, complex, satisfying game, EA has delivered a dumbed-down, lowest-common-denominator piece of garbage.What's more, EA has surreptitiously bundled SecuRom, a piece of corporate spyware, along with Spore. SecuRom installs itself to your system kernel and cannot be removed even by uninstalling Spore, and can cause serious performance problems with your PC.Do not buy Spore. Do not buy any EA Games products."
1,No more business for EA,Well I thought the game was a lot of fun until someone informed me about the DRM. I don't care how EA defines their DRM and how they mince the words. Its obscene. They can claim its harmless but so did Sony when they had their rootkit issue.I will not be buying anything from EA for quite some time. Thank you EA for shafting legitimate customers.
1,Spore + DRM = sucks,Descent game but just can't get pass the DRM. Customers being treated like potential criminals is not kewl.
1,I am not a criminal,I could have downloaded the game 4 days before the official release from one of the many pirate sites but as always I try to do the right thing and support the game makers by paying my $50. So to return the favor EA will get me the game 4 days later and make installing and playing the game a lot harder then if I would have installed a pirated copy.This is a windows game. I and almost everybody else has to rebuild their machine every six months because the operating system gets itself in a twist. Also I seemed to have to upgrade the system on a regular basis. On each of these occasions I will have to use one of my three installs because the EA copy protection system thinks I installed this on a different machine. I will reach my 3 installs quickly and I am not happy about having to convince EA that I am not a thief every time this happens.
1,DRM *is* part of the game,"If you intend to play through this game once and then throw it in the trash, the DRM may be no reason to dissuade you from purchasing this game. But if you are like me and intend to install the game at various times in the future, the DRM is a deal-breaker. I pull old games off my shelf all the time to enjoy them again and again.Some reviewers are giving this game 5 stars and claiming that the DRM is not part of the game, that we should focus our reviews on the game. The purpose of reviews is to help people make informed decisions about potential purchases. Not merely to indicate whether the game is fun. The packaging does not indicate that you will only be allowed to install this game three times, so it's up to the community to disseminate this information to the uninformed. It seems unlikely that people would prefer to make this purchase ignorantly."
1,It doesn't even let me run the game on my old 1998 computer,"I checked the System Requirements on the Spore website and I thought that it would be no problem to install and run the game on my old 1998 PC. But after I bought and installed the game on my computer successfully, I started the game and it gives me an error message say that my system doesn't meet the system requirements, the game will quite. I spent my money to buy the game, and I didn't even try the game yet. The Spore game is developed by the same developer of The Sims 2. I ran The Sims 2 on my old Windows XP machine without any problem. My computer is actually much lower than the System Requirement of The Sims 2. I don't know why Spore game would give the Error message and exit out instead run the game on the lower systems. I will look forward to the future on the Open Source alternative similar to Spore game for the older hardware."
1,EA and their DRM..,"Its a good game, the creation tools are fun and space is nifty. The other phases are very shallow grinds thru uninspired mechanics.The overall score has to be a 1/5 because DRM like this is total crap."
5,My 10 year old LOVES this game,"I bought the PC download version of Spore, and I wanted to put in a good review to counteract some of the negativity. There seem to be a lot of disgruntled adult gamers who expected a more sophisticated game experience and gave this one star. I think that is a shame; it is rated E10+ after all! It is the perfect amount of sophistication for my 10 year old, who has spent hours at it (and said he'd rate it 16 stars if he could). It is especially a shame, given that there are tons of games rated Teen or Mature that are not suitable for kids. This one is. I did not have any problems with the download or running the game on his machine with Windows XP. We did have to register online but I don't find that a big deal with parental monitoring."
1,Was almost going to buy untill.....,"I saw that there where over 3 thousand ratings with an average of 1.5 stars... that literally speaks for itself. Too bad because I thought Spore was going to be a cool buy for my little siblings... but since I read about the drm limiting you to a minimal amount of activations, *sigh*.It appears EA officially ruined a really good product."
1,"This type of DRM with not stand, man!","Do not treat your customers as ""Criminals First"". The DRM has already been cracked and is online anyway, so what was the point, seriously? The only people who are being punished is those of us who actually pay for quality games.NO DRM!"
1,Boring and you will beat the game within 7 hrs....,"Pros: Revolutionary in many things it does, but does none of them wellyou can customize allotSocial aspect via webCons: boring! It has a great premise on paper, but it doesn't play out at allyou will beat the game really really fast!game plot way to fixed and linearnot challenging, hard, or complexSummary: while this game is fun for about the first hour, you soon find that it is too easy, too repetitive, too predictable. overall, innovative, but when you get down to it, I would willing to pay $15 max for this game."
1,ea ruined it for me,"I was very excited about this game then I found out about its drm issues. the only people the drm is hurting is the legitimate consumer. pirates have already cracked it and can re download the game as many times as they want. If i need to download it more than three times, I'm out of luck. sorry ea thanks but no thanks. I will consider purchasing it if they deal with this mess."
1,Electronic Arts ruins all great ideas.,"EA puts DRM which punishes the paying customer, meanwhile the many people who pirated it a week before it came out don't have to be treated like criminal's after their third install.Not to mention a good bunch of features were removed due to EA's pressure to make money now, add expansions later mindset."
1,Client DRM is wrong,Don't create DRM on the client. Let me install this game as many times as I want but make me prove I own the game when I log in to the servers. I won't buy the game until the DRM changes.
5,Very Good,"For me, the game is very fun. It made me stay many hours in front of my computer, and really enjoyed it. 5/5"
4,"A little dumbed down, fun, stop whining about drm","1800 reviews whining about drm suggests an organized effort.I have to say I was a little let down by the evolution gameplay (I'm at the tribal stage now, so I can't comment on the later aspects of the game.)I would have thought that more importance would be placed on style of creature evolution and not just playing the stat game.Yeah, it's pretty awesome that things move and behave in an adaptive way relative to how you've outfitted your dude, but I thought the effect was going to be more than aesthetic.I had trouble getting the hang of making friends with other tribes/races, so.... I just sorta killed them ;).Fortunately nothing in the evolution stages is SO easy that you're going to quickly master it. There will always be someone out there with more spikes on their head.I recommend it. If DRM matters THAT much to you? Eh... write your own game."
1,I was going to buy it but...,"I was going to purchase this game. The BF and I were going to start characters together and all that, but all of my friends are warning me against it because of the DRM.Oh well, looks like another game goes down the tubes."
1,I was tempted to purchase...,"I was tempted to purchase, but frankly, the DRM is too much hassle. Sorry EA, drop Securom and we'll talk again..."
4,All reviews that focus on DRM should be removed,"Spore itself is an entertaining game that covers a wide variety of genres. None of the phases are particularly deep, but each has personality. I'm enjoying the game.The only reason I'm writing a review though is to state my disgust with the DRM whiners. Yes, Spore has copy protection. It isn't as ""draconian"" as these people would have you believe--you have to connect to the internet once to activate the game. After that, never again unless you want patches.So, please, take your political nonsense elsewhere and review the game based on the game, not your misconceptions about the anti-piracy software that's attached to it."
1,Fun Game Hindered by Overzealous DRM,I used up all three of the licenses they gave me just trying to get the game to work. I had to call EA tech support to ask for a new license after that and they were not kind about it and asked me all kinds of questions about which computers I installed it on and if they were located in the same household when i had already told them i had tried installing it three times on one computer with no luck getting it working.I finally got it working but now i have no installs left. Go figure.
1,DRM kills an otherwise OK game,"This review says it all...DRM is a show stopper. I doubt this game will work for me after a few years given my habit of new hardware purchases and system snapshots. Like others have said, this game is for rent not sale.The EA Spore DRM is a bit reminiscent of the Sony root kit. It installs software that you definitely don't want or need. That software can work in superuser space, meaning it can do whatever it wants on your system. And there is no uninstall for it. In other words, by installing Spore, you install a piggy back Big Brother.Please don't support this product. Great game. Lousy distributor."
1,DRM sucks!,I was ready to buy Spore until I read about the issues with the DRM. This sucks. I will not spend my money on a rental. EA can kiss my money goodbye.
4,A very good introduction to an essential Buddhist teaching,"Whilst reading this book one should always bear in mind that although published in 1990, the text is taken from a series of lectures delivered in 1968 shortly before Sangharakshita went on to found the FWBO (Friends of the Western Buddhist Order)and so there is necessarily some emphasis on certain points more applicable to that era. However, once the reader has accepted this and come to terms with Sangharakshita's style and insistence on precise translations and definition of terms, the 'dry' lists of traditional Buddhist doctrine are explained and brought to life in a manner that has relevance to both men and women today seeking an introduction to a core Buddhist teaching. I highly recommend it."
2,"Dubious information, egotistical tone","Dr. Schoen never met a form of ""alternative"" therapy that he didn't like. I'm all in favor of keeping an open mind and exploring non-traditional forms of healing. On the other hand, I think that your mind shouldn't be so open that your brain falls out. Extraordinary claims should require extraordinary evidence.Just once, I'd like to hear Dr. Schoen say, ""This form of therapy is complete clap-trap. I don't think it works, and it might even be harmful"". Instead, Dr. Schoen embraces everything from acupuncture, to Chinese herbs, and all things in between.And on top of that, the author's tone is one of self-aggrandizement and condescension toward his ""less-enlightened"" colleagues.I'm a life-long animal lover and pet owner. I volunteer at the local animal shelter. I really disliked this book."
2,"Seriously, Where?","Since his solo career started in the 80's Phil Collins has been a mastermind of pop music from the second British Invasion. As his time came into the mid 90's, he had no place to go on the radio, and in the mainstream.His 1996 album, Dance Into The Light, is a bit more upbeat than Collins previous albums. Although the album is a complete turn from his 1993 album, Both Sides, the music proved to be a sorrowful project. The songs here are very much in-between, and only two songs stand out very well on the album, Dance Into The Light, and It's In Your Eyes. The music borrows the feel of African rhythms and effects, but is nowhere near Peter Gabriel's triumphs in African Beats. Surprisingly, the album was Phil's last studio albbum, before announcing his departure from Genesis that same year.Although Phil Collins created many hit songs, this album isn't as big of a keeper as his 80's albums, or his days with Genesis. Dance this one out of the light."
2,A copy of Gabriel,"Dance Into the Light shows that Phil Collins do NOT want to be in new grounds himself. He has copy the Peter Gabriel and David Byrne style in this record. This is not a pure Collins record, There is a Gabriel/ Byrne record. But also, the non-ethnic songs are pure commercial songs. Collins has lost his own identity long time ago."
4,Very Cute,"This was the first book by this author that I've read and I thought it was very cute. I was unsure at first because the first few pages made the main character sound very winny, but it picked up and turned out to be a very good and quick read. I've ordered other books by this author after completing this one."
1,Fake,"I ordered from Amazon LLC after reading negative reviews from third party sellers.For starters, the package had clearly been opened and resealed.The cologne reeks of rubbing alcohol, with absolutely NO other scents.Don't make the mistake I did, spend the extra $ and go to a dept store!!! Unless of course you're in the market for a $60 bottle of rubbing alcohol."
4,I rate it a 3.5 - not great but good,"Being a developer/software engineer, I couldn't resist a fragrance called ""CODE"". :) It's not bad, but like any fragrance, it's very subjective. Everyone has their own opinion. It was fun to try and I like it enough to wear it on occasion.Enjoy."
5,super!,"I ordered this cologne for my son. He had been using it for several years when the store he bought it from stopped handling it. I found it on line, however, I almost made the mistake of getting CODE for women! They look quite similar, so be sure to read the product description carefully. This cologne is a sexy, fresh scent that is definitely lucious!!"
2,"Love the cologne, but it's a hassle ordering it.","Smells great but the first time it shipped I received the wrong product. The second time it came it was leaking, but at least my gym bag doesn't smell like sweaty socks anymore. I highly recommend the product just next time I will be buying it from a store nearby."
5,Smells heavenly,I have had such a hard time over the years finding a cologne for my husband that both smells good on him and smells wonderful to me. This cologne is so much more than that. I absolutely love this! I will even spray a bit on our bed pillows at times before going to sleep. I'll be using this for just that purpose when my husband is away for work!
2,Armani code mens cologne,I received this in my newspaper this morning. I opened it up and it smells very womanly. I could not believe it is a mens scent! It smells similar to CK One a female relative of mine wears. The Roca Wear X cologne I bought on a whim recently smells exactly like this Armani Code. If you want something quite manly Drakkar Noir or Lacoste are still good choices.
1,avoid at all costs,"Today my 2nd edge dropped from my bike as I rode at high speed. I lost it - even though I had added the more robust mounting after I lost the first one. I took extra care to snap it in, used fresh mounts (they wear out) and it STILL fell off. What a piece of junk.Garmin Edge 205 GPS-Enabled Cycling Computer"
2,Out dated,"The book has a lot of pictures of the different parts of the engine from different manufactures with descriptions. This however does not go into detail of what will work with what. Does not go into detail on rebuilding an engine. It is of some use just not what I thought it would be. A better title would be ""The Aircooled VW Engine Picture Book""."
4,Julia and JoAnn,"I received the Art of French cooking by Julia Child, et.al. and found out that I'm not the cook I thought I was. It's a bit beyond the person who enjoys cooking but likes the 30 minute meal. It is a treasure and I will try to make a few things out of it, but I doubt I would live very long if I ate the way Julia cooked.Mastering The Art of French Cooking, Volume One (1) (Vol 1)"
2,Use in Israel..,"I bought this to use on a recent trip to Israel. While the pin configuration is indeed the correct one for Israel, every single outlet in the hotels I stayed at couldn't accept this adapter because they used a circular recessed fitting that was not compatible with this adapter (this adapter has a large flat surface that exceeded the diameter of the recessed circle). So, in other words I couldnt get it to work at the hotels I stayed (in Jerusalem, Tel Aviv and Haifa). Someone suggested to me that this adapter fits the ""newer"" Israeli outlets, but if they exist they were not at any of the modern hotels I stayed at......?"
2,Pretty but small,"It is a very pretty charm but make sure you take into consideration the measurements. It is very small. I am thinking of putting it on my Build-a-Bear. The charm is very pretty though, I just wish it'd be bigger."
4,A Father For Brittany,"When I saw this movie a few years ago it was called A Father For Brittany, since I'm a fan of made for tv movies I watched and I was crying right from the start I thought it was about time that they make a movie where they show that men actually do like being fathers and that they fight just has hard if not harder for their children as any woman. I love this love and can't wait to get the dvd."
2,what did I miss?,"Ok, so I rented this movie because I have a lot of friends who said it was fantastic. As I was watching, I found myself wondering what they saw that I didn't. It's a terrible movie. There is absolutely no development of the plot or characters. It's completely unrealistic (no fifteen-year-olds could live through that mess without any kind of emotional support). In fact, the only good thing about this movie is the soundtrack and Leisha Hailey with pink hair."
1,a great dissapointment. see high art instead.,"i was greatly dissapointed in the viewing of this video. i hate to say it, but it basically [stunk]! this movie lacks plot and character development. the only high was a 5 second clip of ani difranco singing shy, cos well, ani rocks..."
5,i just have this memory of summer,"All Over Me totally blew me away, although i only ended up watching it because nothing else was on. In a way it reminds me of summer, becasue it was such a hot sumer night when i watched it, alone in my room, while chainsmoking out my window. Unlike so many corperate hollywood trash films, the story seemed to be openly honest and throughout i felt for claude like she was my best friend. Afterwards i searched for it everywhere but to no avail, until i found it had been released on video. Overall what strikes me most is how this film has remained so vivid in my mind, when so many others have meant nothing. I cant speak for anyone else, but i urge you to watch it and judge for yourself!"
5,Loved this movie,"I really loved this movie- everything about it- the acting is superb, the direction is excellent and the plot is very well done. This movie meshes together very well. It seems very real and raw when watching it and there are TONS of messages sprinkled throughout the movie that make it flow very nicely. Excellent"
4,Wonderful western classic,"This is the first Zane Grey book I've read and I loved it.The story is about a son coming to Arizona to help his cattle-ranching father for a pending feud with sheepherders in the 1870's. On the way there he meets a woman sheep herder and falls in love--only to discover later that she is the daughter of his father's arch enemy.As the tale unfolds its mixture of action and romance, the book becomes impossible to put down. The detail in which he describes the action scenes leaves you feeling like you are right there in the middle of the gun fight. The romance is sweet and endearing.At times, some of the descriptions of the landscape seemed a bit wordy, but did not detract from the overall story."
2,Confusing book,"I am currently taking AP Physics B, and this textbook has become the enemy of mine and many of my classmates. For a intro to physics book, this book would be difficult to comprehend. The book does offer in-chapter examples, but the problems that are worked are straight-forward. However, the problems at the end of the chapters are hard and confusing. It does require thinking (which is a good thing), but some problems would take hours, literally, for the average physics student. The book does have answers to MOST odd number problems, not all. There is no solution to show how they arrived at the answer. The solution manual is a must to understand or to get started on hard problems. This book would be great for a physics student who understands the concepts and wants to enhance their knowledge with challenging problems. It is not a good book for people trying to understand physics."
1,Where is my book?,I cannot give a review of this product since I still have not received the book!!! It is already two week overdue! My daughter needs this book!!
1,A Beginner Physics Student's Review,"I had this book in my AP Physics B class. I and my friends all found it to be somewhat frustrating. The text is often hard to read and sleep-inducing, while not being very helpful at all in teaching the skills we needed in the class, or on the AP test. While a few of the diagrams were okay, most of the other diagrams and example problems were very confusing. The arbitrary way the equations are derived and spread all over the place makes it worse. This is not a book for the beginning student, especially if you don't have *very* good math and logic skills. Also, there were a lot of unneccessary info in the book, while not enough emphasis & elaboration is put on the more important aspects of basic physics. All in all, not a very good book for the beginning student."
1,VERY DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND,"I used this book for my AP physics course. The idea of physics is to learn how to problem solve. This book would show you a few problems in the chapter and then dump a massive amount of problems on you at the end of the chapter with the answers for only the odd numbered problems, but those didn't have explanations! How can this book be helpful if there are no solutions. I wouldn't recommend this book...."
2,I'll Be,I like Foxy Brown but I didn't realize Jayzee was also performing in this song. I hope Foxy comes out with more songs but preferably WITHOUT jazyzee. I stopped listening once I learned jayzee is involved.
4,Inbal's Show ... Interiorized Bartok,"There are more exciting, more strongly characterized recordings of this strange masterpiece. Kertesz (Decca), Dorati (Mercury) and Boulez (Sony or DGG) all present performances that absolutely brim with theatrical atmosphere; you can almost visualize how each performance would appear on stage. Inbal (like Fischer on Sony) takes a different tack. Inbal plays ""Bluebeard"" as interiorized mind-drama and, in a way, this is perfectly suited to the kind of theatre piece Bartok and his collaborator Bela Balasz created over 70 years ago. Like Debussy in ""Pelleas and Melisande,"" Bartok in ""Bluebeard's Castle"" presents a drama that really occurs in someone's mind - Bluebeard's - or the author's - or the listener's. Sort of like theatrical chamber music ala Strindberg. Inbal's singers are not in the same league as Dorati's et al., but this is a recording that should be heard nevertheless. Wonderfully rich yet transparent sound from Denon."
1,A Piece of Junk,"First of all, the product pictured here and the one you will receive are completely different. The one I got was of lower quality and did not work. I looked into sending it back, but the cost of shipping would have cost me more than I planned to spend.I am really disappointed and feel that Amazon should take this product down to protect their reputation. This device is a waste of money and time. DO NOT BUY IT."
2,It's not what I expected.,It's too thin for use.It should have been at least 1/8th of an inch thick.And it should have released from the protective tape much easier.
2,"Good performance, poor recording","Everyone has their favorite Christmas music, and if you've heard these selections in the past and like them, then by all means order the disk. The performance is fine.The problem is the fidelity of the recording, which manages to sound both muffled and shrill at the same time. This has nothing to do with the time period in which the recording was made (splendid recordings from London and Mercury were made back then) but with poor technique. Sound quality wise, this is a dollar bin recording: it might sound acceptable in a car system or boombox but that's about it.However, if you are the type of person who cares only about the music you will most likely find it acceptable. For myself, I have to believe there are other well recorded orchestral Christmas albums worthy of your hard earned dollars."
1,Stupid Record,"There are somebody clapping hands at the start of every song, which is very very annoying. I get the maker of the record just mixed those into the original record, this is really stupid."
2,quality of sound poor,I found the quality of the sound not up tp par On 1 song it skips not good for a new DC I do not know if this was a re-recorded or not but I would have returned it but I played it several times.
3,Slow getting delivered,The item was delivered either at the very end of the date range or after it. Arrived in good shape.
4,the oldies rock,"This music brought back some memories. The music was always great - these two always had a great blending of voices. Part of the album was recorded live. They improvised a little bit from the originals on the live recordings, and naturally they were excellent, but I'm a stick-in-the mud who likes the oldies exactly the way I remembered them back in my youth. Ah, well - good music no matter what."
1,"Right songs, wrong versions","I was sorely disappointed to find that half the cuts are live recordings. So I am bombarded with applause, and the songs don't sound the same as the popular versions. A waste of money!"
2,"Great songs, bad CD","I bought this because it had pretty much all my favorite S&G songs on it. Amazon's own review misleads by saying: 'Their studio perfectionism is never better served than here."" -- which leads one to think this is a collection of studio recordings. But many of the cuts are in fact live versions with intrusive applause, cheering etc. Wish I'd read some of the negative reviews before I purchased it!"
1,"Great songs, but poor recorded quality","I should read the 1 star reviews first, all of them point out the lousy recording quality. It is horrible distortion if you play it at the pure stereo."
4,In the name of Iran,"This is a great book to read about Safavid Empire roles in converting Persia to 12 Imam shiite. The book focused on two areas. One, how Friday pray became accpetable in shiite Iran, and direction of pray was indispute. Last, the mystery of hidden Imam.The book did not focuse on one historical figure, the author discuused all the Safavid Kings."
5,Love 30 Rock!,I think this seriers is great and really enjoy Tina Fey's writing. Very funny and always what you expect from 30 Rock!
2,"good collection, but disappointed by the edits","Claudja's hottest hits are here, but sometimes, over a minute or more is shaved off the 12"" versions. the 3 tracks I noted were my faves ""Radio Action,"" ""Boogie Woogie Dancin Shoes"" and ""Down and Counting"". Hot Productions compiles great dance artists, but more often then not, they pull this stunt of editing tracks. Also, several of the times for the songs listed on the CD card do not match up with the actual times on the CD."
4,Classical Fans Delight,"It's rough, but in a kind of gritty, dark way.If you are the type of person who doesn't do well watching movies with classical text, stay away (although if you're thinking of purchasing this then I doubt you are the average moviegoer looking for an interesting jaunt through 17th century text).Some good acting and use of language by the cast. Understandable and a good, for myself, academic film experience. I must admit though I bought this to watch Tilda Swinton who does not disappoint in her performance.I am not sure when I will be in the mood (if ever to watch it again).I might rent it before buying it though..."
2,Bizarre,"I couldn't get into this movie. I tried, I really did, but if you think these two guys are too pretty, see your optician without delay. There's nothing to latch onto in the way of a story. It just meanders along and you have no idea what motivates the characters or what they want. Bring a good book to read while you watch this yawner."
3,Silver Lady,"Lady of the garden pink rose pendant. I really like the pendant, but wish it was larger."
4,If Someone Had Known (True Stories Collection),"This is a very good movie. It arrived quickly and in excellent condition. I recommend this movie to those who, like myself, enjoy true stories."
5,Good inexpensive replacement hub,"My orig. Dodge Ram black cone hubs were stolen off my passenger van last year. Dodge wants 50.00 PER hub (the black plastic cones with the Ram head on it) so 200.00. This was a perfect universal hub for my 16"" tires that didn't cost an arm and a leg!"
5,WOW!,This is a wonderful cereal. It actualy tastes like cereal. If you have celiac you will definitely want to try it.
3,Vicky,"Nice to have a genuine multigrain product for a Gluten Free Diet. This is a good tasting cereal, but it get soggy pretty fast. I mix it half and half with some homemade Granola and it is a pretty good breakfast that way."
2,Pick other flavors!,"The big 100 bar exceeds expectations in terms of the supplements it offers. What it fails at miserably is palatableness. Bear in mind that this is only true of this variety of bar. The texture is very sticky and almost clay like. And what are supposed to be chocolate chips, seemed to me like hard stones. It was absolutely horrible and I struggled to finish an entire bar.I would advise you to stay clear of this bar as there are other viable alternatives offered by Met-Rx which cost around the same amount of money. One of them is the Met-Rx Big 100 Colossal Meal Replacement Bar.(Super Cookie Crunch or Crispy Apple Pie). Both those bars tasted great and offered the same if not exceeding supplement value."
4,Not usually Rock Hard,"I have been eating these as meal replacements for many years now and while very substantial and chewy, they are NOT supposed to be rock hard. The previous reviewer must've had a stale batch somehow, or maybe faulty packaging had dried them out. At any rate, these are in no way candy bars! They are extremely chewy and taste like sweet and chocolatey vitamins. Yes, they taste like vitamins... but I have grown to LOVE them. Compare all other labels and you will find that these lead the competition - - Highest protein for the lowest fat and calories."
2,Buy something else!,I purchased this DVD player to keep my toddler entertained during a long car trip. It was quirky right from the beginning. A few (brand new) DVDs would not play at all on this device. Some other DVDs would play but would cut in and out during playback. I also found it difficult to get back to the main menu at times. I had to pull the car over repeatedly so that I could climb into the back seat to troubleshoot this player. This made our long car trip take much longer!
2,"Loved it, but it really did die after 1 car trip","Thought it was great. As discussed by other reviewers, the mounting is awesome. Can't believe it just stopped working. Will try to exchange it and see what happens.Also, it does not come with a battery. That is extra $$$. We thought that was a little weird.Update: We received a replacement unit. Also bought the extra battery. Took this to Europe and it worked well, has also worked well in many subsequent car trips. increased rating from 2-star to 3-star."
1,Bought two- both broke,"We were so excited with this product at first. The car headmount is great and the product was cheap. Well, after using it for one car trip it stopped working. Thinking it was just a random problem, we exchanged it for another one.Well, the same thing happened. We played it for one long car ride, and then when we went to use it again, it wouldn't read the disk. Maybe it wasn't designed for long use (we had played it for about 4 hours straight each time)?Regardless, I think you get what you pay for. It's cheap and from a no name company. Nextar? Who is that? If I were you, I would buy something from a more reputable and proven to be reliable company. Good DVD players really only cost about $50 more.If you do buy this, buy it from a retail store so you don't go through the hassles of online returns..."
2,this may be a piece of junk,I played my very first movie on the player the day I got it and halfway through the screen misaligned and half the movie was off the screen. The next time I turned it on it was fine but the DVD player itself started making a loud humming noise which distracted from the movie. I've had it less than a week and the screen misaligned and the corrected again and the irritating and too loud humming persists. The short time that it did work perfectly I was happy with it. BY next week I may be trying to get a refund or trashing it altogether.
1,Very disappointing,"I purchased this dvd as a birthday gift for my sister. When I realized it was only 2 shows, I was upset that itwas so expensive. I thought I was getting a whole season. To top it off, the dvd skipped and then just stopped, soit was a faulty dvd. Not happy! I would like to have it at least replaced. I have always been satisfied withwhatever I have ordered from Amazon, but this was a huge disappointment."
4,Very Danceable,"I got Part 1 of this remix CD. So, I has glad to get my hands on Part 2. Great remixes and very danceable...."
2,Minimum For Sure,"I'm surprised by all of the good reviews. I don't recommend this book, unless its main purpose is to sit on a coffee table and look pretty.The pictures are decent, though many of them look grainy as if they've been blown up to fit the page. But perhaps the most disappointing part of the book was the text. Each picture has merely a paragraph devoted to description, and to compound that frustration, the font is so small (probably 6 point), I had to keep my eyes inches from the page. It would be understandable if the publisher were trying to save room, but clearly that's not the case, as an entire white page is devoted to a small paragraph, which is consequently crammed so near the binding that I had to pry the book apart to read the text. I realize that this style is probably meant to reflect the book's title, but I don't think moving the text to the middle of an already blank page would disrupt this.There are better books elsewhere."
5,a must-read!! an exceptional page-turner,I loved it. I read it cover to cover thrice this week. I definitely reccommend it to anyone with who lives in Chicago or any big city. also perfect for college students who will be graduating soon and entering the workforceFor a beach read or a travel read Résumé is far and away miles above the other candidates.
5,by this cd at all costs,"blink 182 is awesome the best songs on the cd are whats my age again and adams song. even if it costs you 17 or 18 dollars buy it, even if you have to buy the edited version still buy it. get it today"
4,Blink Beginers,"This albulm is great for people who only want one Blink 182 CD. If you are hardcore Blnk fan you might want to get all of the cds or Take Off Your Pants and Jacket and Mark, Tom,a and Travis Show. My favorite song on tis CD is Dumpweed! Great CD and worth buying I you liked the Blink song you just heard on the radio."
4,Fading into pop punk,"Blink is a great band but is slowly turning into a pop punk band. Their old CD's like ""Dude Ranch"", ""Buddha"", and ""Cheshire Cat"" is what i think is their better quality songs. I have all their CD's and don't think this is their worst or best. If you like thier old stuff, then i wouldn't reccomend this to you. If you like their new songs like all the small things, then get this CD now. It's good and i like it, but still prefer their more punk look. They are fading into a pop punk band because of some of their songs on Take off Your Pants and Jacket. I still like all the CD's though. I suggest all of them."
4,they're still alive and kickin it hardcore,"everyone should just chill out and quit being so negative. If you don't like it, don't listen to it. I've been listening to them since back in the day, and I love them. I think they have good lyrics and good songs. Rock on Blink."
4,good cd,"First of all let me say this is a very good cd. But it gets marked down because some of the songs sound the same, a little too the same. But over all a good cd."
4,GO BLINK!!!,"Although blink's old stuff was a lot better. This is one great cd. Mostly all the songs are really great and it's a cd you can listen to strait through without having to skip around the songs you dont like! Blink went a little bit lighter when they made this one, buts it still great! I recommend it to anyone who likes good punk rock!"
1,Music? More like noise.,"The thing that turns me off about Blink 182 is the complete and total lack of originality in their songs. Every song sounds almost exactly the same. They try to be funny with the lyrics and all, but they fail. I could find no enjoyment in this album. Every song has nearly the same guitar and drum beat. This gets boring quickly.Don't even remind me of the singing...those guys need some real talent when they sing, and they just don't have it. They'd easily fail to pass the American Idol tryouts. Their voices bother me a lot, too. It sounds like one of them has a pencil stuck in their voicebox.I like listening to unique music with good vocals, originality, and lyrics that actually make SENSE. Blink 182 fails to meet these requirements."
1,Horrible,This band is terrible and All The Small Things is perhaps the worst song ever written. What has music come to?
2,What's the Big Deal?,"For all its attempt to appeal through the shocking, the bizarre, the quaintly curious (or just however its cover and song titles might strike you), I found little memorable that stayed with me from listening to this. You'd think this album had some big splash it wanted to make, but for me it was more like just a trickle. I have told myself I'll give it another try. I'll listen to it some more sometime and see if somehow there's a profound message I missed. But I just can't get myself in any hurry to do so, and if I had to give it a one-word discription for now, that one-word would be ""lame""."
4,I wink @ Blink!!,"Funny c.d. that really catches the tunes in your head. I can't stop singing ""what's my age again"" and ""all the small things."" And I love their music videos! They are so cool. I love them!!"
2,..naaaaaaaaah! wey!,...this album is pretty lame....don't buy it....the only good thing is travis barker....ok that guy is kinda stupid but he's a drum machine.....just see the transplants!
1,Who let them in the back door?,"A perfect example of just how bad the music industry in America is getting. They are unoriginal and offer nothing new to music in general. It's more of the same thing, basically. My question is this; where's the talent? Good only if you're a socially-inept, low self-esteemed, and are out smoking pot with your supposed friends. Go listen to some REAL music."
4,cool cd,"Its not as good as the first two realeases, but it is still a very cool cd and worth buying."
3,Good- but not too good,"Blink has definetly gotten much more mainstream than they were before with Buddha, Cheshire Cat, and sort of Dude Ranch; but that fact has not influenced me to discontinue buying their cd's. I am still a fan of the band, and the fact that they are not as punk as they once were does not make me want to stop liking them. They do a pretty good job. ""Mutt, Going Away to College, A Party song, Aliens do Exist"", and of course the famous ""What's my Age Again?"" all make the cd worthy of $11.88. However, if you're looking for hardcore punk, don't stop here- Blink 182 was never exactly ""hardcore"" anyway."
2,Enema of The Toilet is more like it,"This cd turned out to be a terrible value. I wasted $15 just to get all lousy songs except for All the Small Things, and Whats My Age Again? I feel like a threw my money right into a porter potty and watched it get flushed. If you appreciate the samples for this cd, I have nothing against you, but if I were you I wouldnt buy it"
3,Decent in spite of everything,"Attacking Blink-182 for writing shallow lyrics may seem pointless (after all, the disc is called ""Enema Of The State"") but it's a legitimate complaint. Nearly all the lyrics sound like fragments of a junior high locker room conversation. The only exception is ""Adam's Song"", which is melodramatic, pseudo-deep crap. The band apparently annoys when they're being immature and annoys even more when they try to be serious.However, Blink-182 did manage to write four incredibly great songs: ""Aliens Exist"", ""Mutt"", ""All The Small Things"", and ""Don't Leave Me"". Quite simply, these are unbelievably catchy punk-pop songs. Here, the band's lyrics never get too annoying and the music will never leave your brain. Also, the band sounds like they're having a lot of fun, which is a nice change from the depressed whiners out there. So this is not a great album, or even a good one, but a bad album with four killer songs. It may be worth it to pick this up just for them."
3,Could have been better,"Hello Blink-182 fans. I have been a Blink-182 fan since they released Cheshire Cat. I have come to buy this new Enema Of The State album and I think it could have been better. I have nothing to complain about the new drummer Travis Barker for he seems to be better than Scott Raynor. But for you new fans, I would recommend buying the older albums first. I feel the lyrics on Enema Of The State are way too childish and vague, such as on Aliens Exist, Dysentery Gary, All The Small Things and others. I wouldn't say this record is a bad one, but Blink-182 has done better stuff in the past. If you compare the lyrics from Cheshire Cat to the ones on Enema Of The State, you'll see that I do have a point. I think this time Tom and Mark went way too far. People like serious songs too."
5,I Love This CD!,"This CD is so cool! Whenever I'm going on a long car drive, I listen to this over and over. Here's a track listing, and next to the title, I put how good it is:1. Dumpweed- 10/102. Don't Leave Me- 8/103. Aliens Exist- 7/104. Going Away To College- 10/105. What's My Age Again?- 10/106. Dysentary Gary- 10/107. Adam's Song- 9/108. All The Small Things- 6/109. The Party Song- 10/1010. Mutt- 9/1011. Wendy Clear- 9/1012. Anthem- 9/10I don't skip any of the songs except for ""All The Small Things"" because I've heard it too much, and I'm getting tired of it. This cd is my favorite that I own, and if you love Blink but are not allowed to get cds with ""Explicit Content,"" you should get this! Oh, and enough of this bull about Blink being sellouts!"
1,OH look at me,"If you call this punk or anyother band like this aka: New found glory, Good who the _ every, AFI, etc then you are not punk! This is not punk in anyway. Oh look at me I can play three cords and have tats so I gusse that makes me punk! If you want to lission to some real punk then pick up some any punk anytime before 90's. So that makes 80's and 70's punk is real this new stuff is not. Don't hate because I just tell you how it is."
1,A POLTICALLY CORRECT VERSION OF GREEN DAY & BLOODHOUND GANG,"This music is so un-original, they use the same tone vocally, and musically, a real bubblegum pop, for teenagers who like no to challanging music.Green Day and Bloodhound Gang, always progress a step further with each song, being inventive with music, as well as lyrics.Blink 182 is the same from track one to whenever the album finished, that's how bland it is, i had to exchange this cd for something else at the shops, it's that bad. A message to 182. Leave it to Green Day and Bloodhound Gang. And wait till your balls have dropped, and become lyrically and musically tallented, before you start on another album."
1,Sell outs,"Blink 182 actually used to be decent (Cheshire Cat) but has steadily gone downhill since then. A little while ago I had to take my sister clothes shopping at Limited Too and saw folders, pencils, and various other junk with Blink 182 all over it, right next to the 'Nsync posters and Backstreet Boys calanders. They have to be the biggest sell outs in all of music history. I am ashamed to say I own some of their cd's. While they never were exactly ""punk"", they have slowly deteriorated into their current pathetic state of teenybopping, sick-humored (The Mark, Tom, and Travis Show...), trendy, highly overrated pop. I can only imagine what the ""music"" of the upcoming insult upon human ears-Take off Your Pants and Jacket- is going to sound like. We've already had our first preview with Rock Show. I pity the many souls who listen to and actually like this trash that has soiled the whole genre of punk-pop."
4,Flows Together Quite Well,"Not being a big fan of today's music, I bought this CD after two great singles. Despite the fact it takes time to get used to, once you do, it's sensational. The songs all flow right into one another quite smoothly. The only downfall is that most of the songs sound alike, and the CD is rather short. However, the quality of the music that IS on there, certainly makes up for it."
1,"uhhhh, nah",This is one you'll definitely find on the 99 cent bargain rack at Wal-Mart pretty soon. But don't give that much for it.
5,This album is great!,"this Album is great and all the song on it are great. ""All the Small things"" is also a great song. This CD is really worth your money!"
2,Jam packing all the TRl fun,I am from there hometown and I remember when this was genuine band trying to make good music.But in the last 2 or 3 years they seem to be trying to play up to girls 12 -16.You could see them at Soma after dude ranch had been out for a while they were playing too the bubble gum crowd.To all the kiddies go see a real san diego band like sprung monkey
5,Blink 182 = total punk,"Oh yeah, this album is 'Punk' with a capitol 'P'. This is my third Blink 182 album and they keep on getting better and better by each album. The on this album, songs are wonderful to listen to, even if you don't usually like punk music. If you liked 'Whats My Age Again' and 'All The Small Things' you'll love this album. They got an outstanding punk beat and clever and impressive lyrics that almost everyone can relate to. Let me add that they can also dance a whole lot better that the Backstreet Boys, if you know what I mean. Congrats to Blink 182!"
3,"BLINKing heck boys, come on!","Blink 182 are still one of the greatest bands ever, but Enema is a bit of a let down on some of thier old stuff. All The Small Things is very catchy, and Adam's Song is cool, but I'd look for some of their older stuff before getting Enema of the State. Cheers."
1,Isn't there anything better to do than this. . .,"Blink 182, get a life.I think that this band ought to be titled Blink 180, or Blink, turn 180 degrees and run. Every song sounds like the other. The poor rhythms never vary, and the monotone vocals drone on with these practically obscene, juvenile, and uncreative words. Perhaps these ""artists"" could not express themselves without such. Too bad.Read the lyrics. Listen once. Hear the expressions of fools without regard for daughters, mothers, or themselves. There are NOT so many years ahead to fall in line. Life passes like mere smoke. I would wish that Blink would take things a little more seriously. Charis (Proverbs 18:6-7)"
4,apoligies,"hi i am the ""kid"" hu wrote a previous review recently. jus sayin dat dysentery gary is a gr8 song and i don't no y i rated it so lowly b4. sory. it is a totally amazing song which has grown on me immensely. cheers"
2,"To be perfectly honest, they ARE talented young boys.","Nothing more. No notable lyrics, no political stance, just more of the same ""boys just wanna have fun"" pap MTV has been churning out for years. I'm more disapointed in myself for shelling out 5 dollars for a used copy of this CD from one of my friends. Pity."
2,Eclipsed? Who would care?,"I can clearly see the appeal here; I'll give them due credit for finding a niche that clearly deserves mining... and there is NO other Blink 182, that's for sure. Each and every song could stay in your head for days, and, unfortunately, they sometimes do. The musicianship displayed borders on my infantile excursions with pots and silverware in the kitchen. And it kinda makes me sick when someone says they're awesome musicians because they can play FAST. They must be awesome lyricists, then, too, cause they sing fast, right? When you play those same three chords over and over again long enough, IN THE SAME ORDER, mind you, you're gonna get fast at doing it.I just wish that everyone that liked Blink 182 would take the time to listen to Idlewild, or better yet, early Pavement. At least they do something in the genre that can be described as pioneering."
2,Blink 182,"Enema of the State isn't that great. Blink has no talent, I play guitar and am able to play all their songs without a single problem.I am only giving this two stars because Travis really is an amazing drummer and the other star goes to the barely listenable songs.Tip: Have Mark sing, Tom sure as hell can't.And it isn't even punk, some people accuse The Offspring of selling out (they did not), I am surprised no one has accused that of Blink 182.If you want pure Punk, go buy Pennywise, or The Vandals, you want Punk Rock, buy The Offspring."
1,What the hell Happened?,"I'd have to say that blink 182 sucks now. Their older stuff was much better. Their first release was probably the best.I HATE PEOPLE WHO CALL THEM PUNK NOW. THEY AREN'T PUNK AT ALL. THE BAND EVEN CALLS THEMSELVES PUNK. THAT IS SO ANNOYING. This cd and band is horrible. After this cd and selling out, I lost my interest in the band. They were much better AND MORE PUNK with the old drummer. This band used to be good and now are just for teenybopper girls and homosexual boys. For some of the other reviews, blink 182 isn't the only band that writes their own music and plays their own instruments. If you want real punk, try Bad Religion (The best punk band ever), Pennywise, NOFX, MXPX, Good Riddance, Descendents (which blink 182 does NOT sound like), and any other REAL punk band. BLINK 182 IS NOTHING BUT A JOKE!"
5,exelent cd though short,this cd was funny and meanigfull at the same time it gets poppy sometmes but makes up for it with many other great songs. dumpweed10/10 don't leave me8/10 aliens exist8/10 going away to college8/10 what's my age again10/10 dynstery gary 9/10 adam's song 10/10 all the small things7.5/10 the party song1000000000000000000000000000/10 mutt8/10wendy clear*0/10 worst song ever anthem10/10 overall A-
5,The best way to spend 35 minutes,"Blink's music is the type of music that get stuck in your head and you can;t stop thinking about the catchy words and guitar sound, if you don't have at least one Blink CD you are crazy go get one. Make that all of them."
4,Takes some getting used to!,"This is a phat album but you have to listen to it about 4 times before you really like it!!! I haven't heard there other cds other than the mark tom and travis show and this cds cool. Although, if you like punk all you will find is dumpweed, alieans exist and dystenery gary. Rock on yall!!! Limp biscut rules!"
1,2 Words: SELL OUTS,"They used to be punk rock on Dude Ranch, and i thought it was great. then my tastes matured, and i stopped listeninng to them daily. they grew old.... I heard on a commercial that they were comming out w/ a new cd, and i was gonna save up and buy it, but it seemed that they sold out way more than i imagined. they arent PUNK, THEY ARE POP......STUFF THAT ONLY TEEN AND PRETEEN GIRLS (LIKE MY SISTER, who i am now afraid that she will actually take advice from these dopes...) CAN LIKE......they just want money.....IF YOU WANT REAL MUSIC, GO LISTEN TO METALLICA, OR KORN OK?"
1,Blink 182 went from hero's to zero's.,"Despite how much I like blink, i was extremely disappointed with their newest cd. My opinion is that they sold out, but the fact is that they changed their music after getting 'big'. BTW true blink fans would have their older albums... not just Enema of the state. There is alot of controversy over Blink 182 selling out, but I believe that they did after listening to the first five tracks. But you can judge for yourself, they just dont sound like they used to."
3,ENEMA OF THE STATE IS NOT PUNK!,"Don't get me wrong- I LOVE Blink182! They're my favourite band! I've been a fan since I got my hands on They Came From Uranus a couple of years ago. Also, I like Enema of the State! The songs are catchy, fun and usually vulgar (A Blink trademark! ) However, I would hardly call this album PUNK. The CD is good though, especially with the Party Song verses. Mark and Tom are still kickass when it comes to playing and writing music. It's obvious that they have definitely kept their same demented sense of humour- which is why it's so much fun to listen to this band! Just a suggestion though: Anyone who wants to hear a REALLY awesome Blink song should check out Girl Next Door or Wrecked Him if you haven't already!"
1,1188 reviews of this album?,"At the time I am writing this, a whopping 1188 people have already posted reviews on Amazon for this album. My review is not of the album itself but of the reviewers. YOU ARE ALL CRAZY! If you like the album you are definitely crazy. If you are so bent out of shape about the album that you had to write a review, then you are even more crazy. Luckily I am only reviewing the reviewers and not the album itself, therefore I am totally sane. What a relief. Cheers."
3,Sold out a little,"The cd is good, but some of the songs, (such as Whats my age again, all the small things) kind of sound like they have sold out. If you want a good Blink182 cd I highly suggest Dude Ranch."
5,cool,"this is one of blinks best cds. its best songs are all the small things, whats my abe again, anthem, and party song.you should buy it is cool"
4,Dont listen to these people!,"This album is punk rock. Every song is so good. Except the singles. What's my age again, adams song, and all the small things suck. listen to the other stuff besides that. every other track is good. buy the other blink cd's. but this is a really good one you should all check out"
4,awsome music,"awsome cd great,songs, whats my age again,dumpweed,american pie theme song,small things, must have cd"
1,2nd Worst Blink CD,"I was a huge fan of blink until they became sellouts. I loved flyswatter, Budda, Cheshire Cat, and Dude Ranch. But then they came out with this CD. I was so mad because they had become pop sellouts. Songs like All The Small Things and ""What's My Age Again"" make me sick. I'm sick of hearing people say they are blink fans when they haven't heard their old stuff like Chesire Cat and Dude Ranch. They think their fans just because they have EOTS. Your kidding yourself if you think they aren't pop. Listen to this CD after listening to Dude Ranch and you will realise their sellouts. This CD is terrible."
1,What happened to Blink?,I was deeply disapointed with this album. It doesn't even sound like Blink. Once upon a time Blink was an awesome punk band. But all this album shows is that Blink sold out. What kind of Punk band has a song on Dawson's Creek? I'm sure you'll like this album--if you're a junior high girl who listens to the Backstreet boys.
2,SELLOUT,i remeber when i went to see blink when there was only 200 poeple at a show now there are 5000 the new album is alright but i wonder if they even know when the first sold out
2,redwahinee,"i admit that i do love blink,but they are sellouts.nothing wrong with sucess,but they strayed a little from their punk roots and early K-ROQ days to this processed pop Britney Spears junk. listen to siamese cat and then to this new enema cd and tell me you dont hear a definite dif.they better change or they will lose many dedicated fans,including me."
4,PUT YA LIGHTERS UP,THIS IS NOT HER BEST ALBUM AND IT DIDN'T DESERVE 5 MICS BUT IT IS STILL A GOOD ALBUMTOP 10 SONGS1.WE DON'T GIVE A ****2.I KNOW YOU SEE ME3.SHUT UP *****4.WHOA5.ALL GOOD6.LIGHTERS UP7.DURTY8.SLIPPIN'9.SPELL CHECK10.GIMME THAT
4,DEFINITELY NOT BETTER THAN HARDCORE,IT NOT DEFINITELY NOT WORTHY OF 5 MICS. THE SOURCE HAS LOSS IT'S CREDITABLITY ALONG TIME AGO ANYWAY AND ARE LOOKING TO SAVE THERE MAGAZINE. BUT BAKC TO KIM'S ALBUM. SHE DEFINITELY UP THE ANTE FOR FEMALE MC'S WITH HER FLOW ON THIS ALBUM. BUT SOME OF THE SONGS STILL FALL SHORT PARTICULARLY TOWARDS THE END OF THE ALBUM. OVER ALL THIS A BETTER OVERALL ALBUM THEN K.I.M. AND LA BALLA MAFIA. BUT IT'S A BETTER BUT THEN TONY YAYO OR YOUNG JEEZY ALBUM.
1,"this may be the ""truth"" but not her best....",well i bought dis cd only because it was da queen B ! but sadly i wanted my money back! i was disapointed with this project.... dis is no Notorious KIM and no where near HARDCORE or her last cd...to me it sounds like it has to muc filler material (weak songs) i like her style .. i know she dont got no mad flow or rare production skills but she always put out catchy good material not here unfortuantely y is she trying to sound extra hard on her first single? she acts so delicate and lady like and where did dis come from (leave da bk songs to foxy) i only enjoyed we dont give a F____ with twista (go chitown Go sox!) and gimme that da rest of the album is weak i do not understand why everyone is feeling dis boring cd i swear dis is a very dull cd maybe when she gets out she makes a real comeback.. but not reccomended i sell it to anyone for 3 dollars !
4,Trina Fan but showin lil kim love,Lil Kim is a great rapper and it shows on this album its jus sum of the songz are boring well 2 me but i mean if u wanna hear about wat lil kim have 2 say buy this album but if yu want sumthin 2 jam 2 in ya car get trina album she has sum good beats but lil kim she raw i like trina and lil kim she is raw so go get this album trust me she has plenty 2 say but the beats are wackim out cha face
2,average Album,"I Like Lil Kim Personally&find the chick Thick.Musically though she ain't moved me since Biggie&Puffy were handling Her stuff. the Production here is pretty average&nothing really captures my attention by the Lyrics. She is a Legit Rapper,but Her Subject matter ain't really increased over the years.I dig some of Her Earlier stuff,but not alot over the years has moved me.still She has some interesting runs on her Album."
3,Its Just Alright I think Trina Album Betta,First off trina album is not bad at all trina rhymes may be the weakest but unlike lil kim her beats are listenable shut up bitch annoyed the hell outta me and the ONLY!!!!!!!! reason ppl are responding 2 this cd is because her dumb ass lied and she goin 2 jail. I aint hatin or wateva but this album is boring zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz i listen 2 dis cd so that i can go 2 sleep and they say trina voice annoyin jus cuz her voice isnt like a mans on lol doesnt mean she is annoyingand lil kim said that she could swallow a sprite can now i dnt even think trina even can do dat but like the otha person said if u wanna hear wat lil kim has 2 say get it but if u wanna club bangaz get da queen of tha souf glamorest life album
1,Very shallow overview. Repeat of other Sybex books,Don't waste your money! This book just repeats at least 25% of the information from the Workstation and Server books. It skims over topics very lightly and will NOT give you any real help on the MCSE exam. The Exam Cram book is more in-depth than this book.
1,Not My Cup of Tea,"I actually only tried to read the first story in this book, and made it about half way through. My first impression was very different than most of the reviewers. After the first few paragraphs I was thinking, ""yuck."" I don't like the way he puts a sentence together. But I decided to stick with it. Sometimes the first impression wears off and you are left with hidden treasure. What I was left with was a story about a criminal, and his recollections about his horrid childhood. This sort of thing gives me nightmares . . ."

1,Don't Buy It!!!,"We bought the Dirt Quad for our two kids for Christmas. WOW what a disappointment. I let it charge overnight (20 hours) Christmas Eve, Christmas Day the kids saw it a couldn't wait to ride. They began riding and within 20 mins the battery was dead and I had to push it home. The look of disappointment was terrible. I charged it again overnight (24+ hours) and the same thing, maybe 15 to 20 mins of ride time. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone. It was well built but very poorly designed. This thing needs to be retooled to last 2 - 3 hours on a single charge. Don't these manufacturers have kids???????"
1,Razor Dirt Quad,"VERY false advertising for this product. Their own website states, ""excellent climbing ability"" and the product will not go up a small incline on pavement. When I spoke to a manager at the Razor company, he did state that the product will not go up hills (again, mine wasn't even a hill...a SMALL incline). When I read the quote from above he agreed that it didn't match the product."
1,Not safe for 8 year olds,"My 8 year old son recently purchased this product after saving his birthday money and money he received from pet sitting. When he bought the product he was extremely disappointed in how slow the Dirt Quad was as well as how easily it tipped when he cornered. Every single time he cornered a front wheel left contact with the ground.We've had great experiences with other Razor electric scooters and dirt bikes so were really surprised at how poorly this one handled. I think our 150 electric scooter goes faster. Fortunately we were able to return it to Toys R Us for a full refund.This might be a good product for a 5 - 6 year old, but nobody 8+ (as it recommends)."
1,Disappointment,"Ordered Razor ATV, and was sick with performance. Wouldn't run for more than 10 minutes. Then found that the 30 day return policy expired before grandkids returned from Guam and tried it out. Took to authorized repair facility, they said battery good (but I had called Razor who had said battery probably bad and sent new one.) Repair facilility claimed loose bolt was problem and that battery was ok. Took home, same results. Installed new battery (noticed on one of old batteries that someone had marked in red ""bad""). Repair guy said Razor had received batch(es) of bad batteries, which they had to replace. Worked great for one week with new battery; same problem again. Now I'm stuck, have 14 more days on 90 day warranty, but must drive 55 miles each way to repair facility. Am I pleased with performance/service? No way. Would I buy Razor again? No way."
1,Are you kidding me? ZERO STARS!!!,"This was the worst [...] dollars I ever spent. My son almost tipped this thing several times when turning and that is dangerous. He learned to be careful that way, but by the end of the first day it broke. The company sent a new battery, but there appears to be an electrical problem. Company would not fix or replace it and the place where I purchased it would not take it back. [...] bucks for a day of play. Ridiculous!"
3,Dirt Quad Razor,"I ordered the dirt quad for my son as a birthday present. Charged it up all night for over 12 hours and when he finally went to ride it he maybe got about 8 minutes out of it before it needed to be charged again. This went on for about a month before I decided to order a new battery online from Razor. I spent the money and waited 10 business days for it to get to me and it was the wrong part that was sent. I called up again and again had to wait another 10 days to get the right batter for the vehicle. The customer service was horrible, but the dirt quad runs fine now."
3,Best tasting Vanilla Protein Powder to Date,I have had many different protein powders in my time and this is so far the best tasting Vanilla powder I have had. It mixes well and goes great with some strawberries or a half banana. Orange juice also mixes surprisingly well. The only issue I have had is that this protein seems to make me gassier than other brands. Not something I want to admit but something you may want to be aware of before purchasing this product. It's the gas issue that has given this product the 3 stars. I probably won't buy it again because of it.
1,A wretched story from cover to cover,"This book had no redeeming qualities. It's important to somehow connect with the main characters, and to empathize with them to some degree. For me, a good suspense story has to have a break from the darkness once in a while, and an exciting and absorbing plot that has me eagerly waiting to turn the page. This book started badly with it's main character, and only near the end,a candle was lit. It was too little,too late."
1,NOT a toy,"I purchased this for my son's birthday. It's a lovely model, but it is NOT a toy and should not be listed in Amazon's toy department. The trailer doesn't stay attached to the cab; the front of the cab pops off at the slightest touch and cannot be securely reattached; and the mirrors, tire mudguards and wheels break off easily."
5,Very strange,"This oversized paperback is beautifully produced, as are all the Star & Elephant books published by The Green Tiger Press. This one features faux marbled covers and a surrealistic story. Living in the pages of a book, a Radish and a high-heeled blue woman's Shoe are best friends. The cohabitating Letters mostly keep to themselves, playing at ""making words,"" which is incomprehensible to the Radish and the Shoe. The watercolors are whimsical and charming.Then a pair of Scissors attacks the Book! Much mayhem, much destruction. When the Scissors have finally had their way, the Radish, the Shoe, and the Letters all join together to repair their beloved Book.The motive for the Scissors' attack is never explained, making this definitely a book for teens and adults. If you want to read a short children's-book format tale bursting with beauty, drama, and imagination, here you go."
3,Where is the script?,"Visually very stylish and good music, but where is storytelling?Am I just too blind to read it?"
2,Highly disappointing.,"I adored In The Mood For Love. It was a romantic and visual masterpiece. 2046, it's sequal on the other hand is a scattered, disjointed mess with the most heartless and self centered lead character I've ever seen in a so called romantic film. I get it....this man has loved one woman so much that he can't love another....unfortunately that doesn't make for an interesting film. Not to mention it is painfully slow and redundant....BORING. I can't even recommend this film for its' visuals. 2046 doesn't compare to the beautiful In The Mood For Love on any level. If you see it it will only take away from your opinion of the first film. Don't waste your time."
2,So Boring,This movie is so boring. It spends 2 hours talking about the same thing over and over. They have someone speaking Japanese to someone who is speaking back in Chinese. The conversation does not make any sense at all. The only thing I like is the Spanish song. But there is only one. They play the same song over and over for 2 hours.
2,Yawn,"First of all, I'm a slow reader so that doesn't help with movies with subtitles. While the film has a few interesting visuals (if not redundant after a while) the film moves at a snail's pace and the plot seems to lack levels. If you read this and disagree, please let me know what I'm missing."
3,It's worth it for a beginner,"I definetely recomend this book for anyone getting started writing Cold Fusion. However, if you already have a year or two of experience under your belt, think twice before shelling out the cash for this book. I'm not a big believer in having a book aimed at all skill levels and this one is a good example since most of the code examples and explanation for beginers take up a lot of the pages.If you're looking for tips on writing more effecient code, how to better write an application, or just looking for a book to deal with a wide variety of advanced CF applications, this book isn't going to do that for you. Yes, it does cover some key advanced topics but not all of them."
5,Good stuff!,"Right now I am in the middle of my online training, but from what I have seen, this is going to help me a lot after the class is done.Not only that, but it was quick to arrive!Thanks!Sonya"
1,Terrible Advice,"There is only one wise way to buy a home: afford it. We're talking 20% down (forget this 80/20 nonsense), with a fifteen-year (maaaaybe thirty-year) fixed-rate mortgage. Anyone who tells you anything otherwise is leading you to financial turbulence--or is trying to sell you something (as in a subprime mortgage, or a crummy book)."

3,Not The The's Best,"Worth listening to if you're a fan... you bet. Their best? In my opinion.. nope. Soul Mining set the standard, and it's great. I really like Dusk too. I think as with most good artists the music progresses, and with Dusk Johnson demonstrates this."
2,A sad story,"Having read this book and the reviews here, I think that one reviewer makes a good point. If god chose some passengers to live didn't he choose the rest to die? Why do christians have such a hard time with such an obvious concept? One reviewer accuses a reviewer of being an ""Self proclaimed "" agnostic not realizing A. He was talking about someone else and b. The term ""self proclaimed agnostic"" doesn't make any sense. Did he not get his agnostic certification? The F.A.A(federal agnostic adminestration) is going to be angry. Stephen Haynes, the pilot of united 232 is a ""Self proclaimed agnostic"" too. The real reason anybody survived this event is because a competent pilot got the plane on the ground the best way he could. If He had ""Left it up to god"" all the people on the plane would be dead. God is not a very good co-pilot."
3,The FBI Files,It was a good movie. Again a gift but person was really happy about it. Arrived in great condition and in a timely matter. Thank you
3,"Noel, Come Back to us","Frankly, I love Noel Redding's bass and guitar playing. The first time I saw him was with the JHE in 1967. He played a chord that moved all the seats in the front row of the Ambassador Theater in D.C. Noel and Mitch were given far to little credit for the success of the JHE and for that matter Jimi's playing. I had all of Noels LPs, Road, Fat Mattress, and bought his book when I lived in the UK back in 1991. The book was outstanding and provided interesting insight into what really happened in JHE. Anyway, this LP is pretty good but clearly would have benefited from better production values. You can hear bits of his spark but not nearly enough. I really wish Noel would team-up with some good inovative players and do a serious recording. Bottom line for me is I want the guy to live a good life so I'll buy anything he sells.. he gave me 3 of the best years of music in my life."
4,intense read !!,"Its a long read. Other than that I am totaly into it. Many nites reading into the wee hours. Would recomend getting a Kindle, love mine"
2,Punishing,"The main plot - an interestingly-conceived alien race is threatening to destroy all of civilization - is compelling enough to keep you reading. But for god's sake, the subplots and digressions just go on and on, seemingly forever, and most of them contribute absolutely nothing to the story. Many others contribute next to nothing. This and the prequel - both over 1000 pages - would have been much better books at 250 pages. The punishment is literal - you want to find out what happens but Hamilton punishes you with tedious unnecessary detail. I found myself skipping whole pages, sometimes several at a time, just to get through this bloated, almost fatally flawed epic."
2,"Even with a Scorecard, you can't tell the players!","Imagine a juggler with twenty objects in the air at one time, and continually dropping them. That's this book. I have no objection to subplots, but there is a limit.Apparently this book is a continuation of an earlier work. However, a book should stand on its own two feet, and twenty subplots. After thirty pages into the book, I lost count of the characters and what they were doing. Much less, the goal of the writer.A book should be many things, depending on the author, but it should not leave the reader behind. This heavy tome not only left this reader behind, but annoyed as well."
4,Excellent Sci-Fi,"A little overwritten and longer than necessary but, overall, one of the best space operas I have read in a long, long time. In a field filled with a lot of dross, Hamilton stands out as an author who produces consistently exciting, readable stuff."
4,Impossible to put down,"This is an amazingly well written book. It had me staying up way too late into the evening, and I was really concerned about the characters. A fantastic conclusion to Pandora's Star.My only gripe is that at the end it doesn't mention some of the characters that were part of the whole story. There are a lot of characters though and that must have been hard to do, but it would have been nice knowing what happened to all the key ones."
5,You MUST read this!,"This book is brilliant! The characters are very real and it is hard to believe it is just a fantasy novel, because Gemmell's writing just totally absorbs you into the story.Once I finished it I could not wait to read the next book in the series.The way Gemmell takes a weak or flawed character and turns him into a hero is masterfully done. 10 out of 10!"
4,Since Everyone is on a Team - Read this book,"I read this book initially with a focus on Business Team Building. I found it it simple and straightforward. I learned about creating a code of honor for myself first, and then for my family and business. It also helped me look at what I can do to improve me, create my own code and commit to the follow through and believe the results will follow.Simple strategies - hard work to implement - abundant rewards for the people involved in the process.I read a bunch of the negative reviews for this book and felt for my small invesment of time and money the book was worth 10 x's what I invested.If you are a coach, parent, or in a business this will give you a new view on team builing for long term success."
3,Al Green's solo debut album was certainly different from his subsequent releases.,"""Al Green Is Blues"" is certainly very different from subsequent (and much better selling) releases like ""Let's Stay Together"" and ""Call Me"". On this album, Al gives a very bluesy and Southern R&B-styled treatment to then-contemporary Pop and Soul hits--with interesting results. His cover versions of The Temptations' ""My Girl"", Jerry Butler's ""I Stand Accused"" and Billy Stewart's ""Summertime"" make this CD well worth hearing but the other eight tracks aren't quite as strong or riveting. If you are a fan of late-1960s R&B you really should check this CD out but know that its musical content is as far removed as could be from the smooth, creamy and sweet Soul sound that would be the hallmark of his other Hi albums."
3,Great Academic Work,"Prof Davies neither proves nor disproves the new religious movement, Mormonism, but instead gives readers a lot of information about how this church grows and what doctrines we always misunderstand. To ascertain the facts which always misguide historic Christians, both Latter-Day Saints, or less reverently, 'Mormons', and Christians should carefully study this serious, impartial and in-depth work written by Prof Davies."
2,Midnight Louie,The author just has one liners all the way through the book. Hard to follow the story with all her adjectives and adverbs. Nothing like The Cat Who.
3,Christmas Books,"I did enjoy parts of the book, some parts showed great humor and fun...others a bit satirical. All in all an good read."
4,"Competent, at Times Artistic","The Age of Grief is the novella that concludes this collection of six works. It takes the reader into a marriage and shows the somewhat shaky structure that sometimes holds people's lives together. Perl and Dana were students in dental school; now they are practicing dentists with daughters who demand regular attention. When Perl notes signs that Dana is having a relationship, he tries to ignore them, but the children can't. This is a fine analysis of a marriage at work. Although he knows Dana is seeing someone else, Perl is convinced that if he ignores it--that if the marriage and family continue on--Dana will have to give it up. A bout of flu saves them all. The five short stories vary, but The Age of Grief is prime."
1,Doesn't connect,I have seen this same problem mentioned in other reviews... This device will not always connect when you pick it up. This happens to me all the time. I even shipped it back to the company to have the firmware updated. When you get a call you have to dink around with hanging the headset up on the stand and picking it back up again or fiddling with the connect button before the connection picks up and your caller has already hung up. It isn't reliable and there is virtually no support online for it.
2,Mute and headset are both giving me a headache,"Same issue here. I am constantly in/out of calls and need the mute function to multitask for in-person meetings. My last headset failed after 2 years and is the only reason i had a new model issued. Beeping is driving me nuts, luckily i can still mute from the phone base before it goes to wireless base.Tension in also too tight on the headset, or maybe my head is too big? A little bit of bending the headset bracket seems to work."
1,Very disappointed,I was looking forward to this device when I ordered it but have been very disappointed with its since I received it. The range is poor and the battery drains faster than they purport. It was a pain to set it up on my computer and when I called tech support I was directed to a voice mail that sent me to a web site. I went to the web site and was eventually directed to a site the is written in German to solve my problem. It is finally working but as I wrote above - the range has me in a rage.
4,rare dokken song,worth the $4 or $7 with shipping for the Dokken Back in the Streets which I never heard.
3,Does not fit 2002-2006 Escalade w/6.0L,"I bought this because the Amazon website stated it would work for my 2004 Escalade EXT, it doesnt fit the GM LQ9 as the GM LQ9 motor uses a 2 piece thermostat unlike the LS1."
5,Outstanding !,Nothing to add - an outstanding product. Elizabeth is charming and the songs are terrific for both young kids AND adults
5,quick shipping and worked as expected,"I didn't actually install this in my car, but my car is running well again and the check engine light is off. The price here on Amazon was far, far better than on most auto parts sites."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Doth protest?If this is your claim, then coming up with pyrotechnic fancypants and big-noted magic escape artist type tricks in space is not really a good way to distinguish that sort of point, really.That would be like putting on a spandex flag outfit and jumping motorbikes and saying? Evel? Never heard of him.Anyway, a bit of media satire to be found here.3 out of 5"
5,MiniBlaster Magic,"I love the JLab MiniBlaster because no matter where I go I can have my favorite music with me. The sound is clear and I found this product easy to use. I will be giving several of these for holiday gifts and birthday presents to friends and relatives, young and old. The delivery was prompt, and I appreciated the friendly customer service in response to my questions."
3,not up to their first two,"this album is, as always, interesting, but a little less rootsy than the last two. I'd recoomend the others first."
4,"Music of alternating joy, nostalgia, regret, and hope","This is outstanding world music from several traditions: Castillan, Andalusian, Japanese. The instrumentation is quite unique, using a number of traditional instruments from the various cultures.Music styles include flamenco, and tango. This is the kind of music that you can enjoy without understanding the language. After, it's the sound, not the precise ideas conveyed by mere words, that gives this CD its strength.I can't compare this with the group's previous CDs since I haven't listened to them. But judging from this one, Radio Tarifa is a group that should please world music lovers. The album is short, at 36 minutes, but definitely recommended."
3,A Christian version of a Louis L'Amour novel!,"Brazos Fortune is determined to find his dream under some type of cross. However, he is forced to leave behind his youngest child, beloved Dacee. An adventurer herself, she runs away.Gold fever, hunger and hardship mark the adventures and close calls suffered by Brazos and his friends. Bly certainly does a good job of painting the surroundings clearly to the reader.This is the first book of the series, Fortunes of the Black Hills."
3,Not for glass items,"It really does not work well for glass items like spice jars. If you have glass spice jars like the Libbey spice jars, you'll find that they slide around very easily on this metal rack. Maybe it's the somewhat rounded edges with no lip. I like the idea and it's relatively cheap, but doesn't work as well as I expected. I ordered three and one rack came a little bent. If you have other things you want to put on it that are not glass, I can see this product working well."
1,Extremely poor sound quality,"I bought this CD instead of the Ray soundtrack because this one was cheaper and contained twice the songs. It was unfortunately a bad decision. These songs must be all his original recordings dating back to the 50's without any kind of digital upgrade. Hiss, static, hallow.... very poor sound quality. It was unfortunately a waste of money."
1,HORRIBLE STOMACH PAIN!!,I have Celiac Disease and heard so much good stuff about Hemp Seeds. I purchased this 3lb. bag and was excited to try it. The first time I became very nauseous and I did not connect it to the Hemp Seeds. The next time I sprinkled it on my salad. Approximately two hours later I got horrible stomach cramps and uncontrollable vomiting. It was so awful! I was in pain the whole night. I was afraid to eat anything the next day. I just had Gatorade and a banana. I don't think I could ever try Hemp Seeds again. I don't know if this was a bad batch or if they share equipment with a wheat facility. I will never buy this again.
5,Tasty and healthy,"This is a great product, very tasty and at the same time having all kinds of good natural nutrients. I buy it on ""Subscribe and Save"" program, getting 5 lb. every six months and enjoying sizeable discounts. It makes up a part of my regular lunch consisting of an apple, a banana, and a mixture of sunflower, pumpkin, and hemp seeds (1/4 of cup each). The apple a day definitely keeps a doctor away (to my delight), and the seeds provide a close to perfect combination of ""right"" protein and fatty acids. Pumpkin seeds also keep my prostate healthy, which is important in my age. Hemp seeds give the mixture the additional taste and flavor."
5,Marquez vividly captures the anguish of political exile.,"The book chronicles the experiences of a Chilean political exile who returns to film a clandestine documentary during the years of the Pinochet regime. Marquez masterfully captures the essence of Santiago during the dictatorship, and manages to depict the complex and difficult emotions political exiles experience when faced with the return to a homeland that has changed. Beautifully written."
3,Acceptable,"This is enjoyable. It used the Rocky formula - opportunity, crisis, redemption.Robby Benson and Annette O'Toole worked well together.The movie did have serious problems. The coach who recruited him decides he does not like him and asks him to quit. I guess the coach finally figured out that Robby Benson was pretty small. The coach brings in a football thug to basically beat him up on the court.The two heroes on the basketball team are white and the starters that they replace are back. Sorry, that was too obvious.The bit with Melanie Griffith was over the top. OK, we see that Robby Benson was a hick and not wise to the ways of the big city (Fort Collins, Co?)"
2,Gross -- really gross -- but not that funny,"I certainly didn't buy this movie expecting much, but I did think it would at least be funny. The inclusion of the barf bag struck me as a demonstration of good humor, but I think viewers may actually have used it. They attempted to wrap up all these ridiculous ""stunts"" in an loose plot -- which was a bad idea to begin with -- and it really failed. Dismally. They should have just strung the clips together and forgot about continuity.My worst complaint: there were maybe 3 stunts in the whole film that were actually funny. Most of them were just gross. I'll stick with Johnny Knoxville, thank you very much."
3,ok album,"I really bought this album for 2 songs, i didnt have an mp3 player at the time and if had i prob wouldnt have bought it. This item was priced low enough to be worth it, and it came in perfect condition and arrived quickly!"
3,music great but packaging poor,Joshua Kadison's CD was well worth the purchase but the packaging was unacceptable. My merchandise that was advertised on Amazon as new was shipped to me in a cracked and unwrapped case (the front was broken into two pieces). It was clearly recycled and was discouraging of future purchases.
4,"Quite Contrary is Quite Compelling, & Quite Engrossing","Stated simply... This is one of the most impressive reads regarding the Roman Catholic Faith!Not only is it educational, but it is provocative. Well documented and researched, this critical examination of the World's largest religion leaves 'no stone unturned'. The author's insights provides details which often elude even the most diligent students.If you are sincere about the quest for truth concerning the Catholic Faith, it would behoove you to examine this jewel."
5,Flawless! Great cookware,I have had two pans from this collection but this was my first sauce pan. The 3 quart was bigger than I expected but that is great news. The construction is very heavy duty with an industrial / professional feel. That means the piece is a bit heavy. But the solid construction should last a very long time. So this was an investment.Have just used it once and it is super easy to clean. Cannot say enough about these. Much better than the Calpahlon non-stick which we had for two years before the degraded.
4,This is a Great Book!,"I could not put this book down. It was very funny, and a great love story. I would recommend anyone who likes time travel novels, not to miss this one."
2,Chain Whip,I have had this for a while now and it work better than I though it would.I wish I could change the rate that I gave the first time.I would now give it a 5 start rate.It has come in handy a few time here in the last few days.I build bicycle for people that would not be able to have a bicycle any other way.This is what makes me happy to see the smiles on little kids faces.So if any one needs a chain whip then get this little one its works great.
4,beginning jewelers need this book,"When I first started making jewelry 7 years ago, this was one of the first books I bought. Intended as a textbook, it's a good, basic, easy to understand book for the novice jeweler"
3,Merely okay,"Mr. Gunston is known for his detail and accuracy. His book is well done with a lot of photos that have rarely been seen before. What this book lacks is the those details that Mr. Gunston is famous for.It is not a bad book, but I for one would have appreciated more information on each of the aircraft in the book. Though I do understand that it may not be available due to time and lack of specs being kept."
2,Smaller than expected,"I bought this watch as a gift for my mother and the 2nd day she wore it we discovered that water leaked. Nice watch though, but I had to return it. I was very disappointed."
4,i like this product,"earlier i said i did not receive this product. I was mistaken. I did, and i like it. i had this confused with a black polar fleece that i was thinking about ordering."
4,the greatest hits but...,"This is the result of fatboy slim's best songs and while they are, they forgot a song that could be in this album yamama or as I would call it push the tempo. Nevertheless if you are a fan of fatboy slim get it and Fatboy Please Try harder."
4,Glad they're greatest hits,"For only knowing a few of Fat Boy Slim's songs this is a good ""greatest hits"" CD."
3,Right Angle SATA Cable,"As mentioned in other reviews, these plugs are one way only and depending on the location of the hard drive it makes a big deal how the right angle side plugs in. With the drive on the bottom of the Dell, you would need a plug like is already in the stock drive--pointing up. As it is the cable had to be severely bent to make the downward and sideways route. Probably not the best thing to do to a cheap cable."
5,Exactly As Described!,This cable was exactly what I needed when I installed a new hard drive. Works great for my Dell Inspiron 530 with Western Digital hard drive.
5,"Works great, great price.","Local store wanted 4 times the price. Glad to find here, and cheap too. Works fine."
4,The Right Cable if you buy from Amazon,I purchased mine from amazon.com (not a reseller) and I DID receive the correct cable with one end angled.Works fine and seems to be of good quality.
4,Sata Cable,"What can you say about a cable, it's life changing, it made me so happy that I couldn't stop singing, it taught me how to play the trumpet. It's just a cable, delivered quickly and cheaply!"
4,Very nice album,"This album has some truly beautiful songs on it. ""Your love amazes me"" and ""You and only you"" in particular. The other songs though are also very good .. John's tenor voice is strong and he knows how to put the right amount of feeling into each song, whether a love ballad or up-tempo number. Recommended for all of John's fans as well as fans of contemporary country. Booklet includes all lyrics, and photos of John."
5,this is beiderbecke,"I thought I was very lucky to find this cd .It is is a great cd,the opening track will put you in the mood right away.Im coming virginia, has that great period swing and you should hear Ol' man river this is without doubt one of his finest renditions off any thing that I have heard, grab the feeling ,At the jazz ball. you close your eyes a you are there .I found it very difficult to say any thing I did not like on this cd one thing I must say is if you have not got this import then go get it"
4,A Very Enjoyable Read,"My attention captured from the start, this wonderfully spun tale moved at a good clip. I'm sure my 12-year-old daughter would enjoy this as much as I did. I've already purchased the next book in the series."
5,Nutiva Coconut Oil is The Best Tasting,For you dark chocolate lovers: Mix Nutiva coconut oil with unsweetened cocoa powder (about 1:1) and a bit of honey. You can also add Nutiva Hempseeds. Roll it in shredded coconut if desired.These Nutiva products are terrific.
1,Putting pure coconut oil in a PLASTIC container???,"This is awesome coconut oil, but it is packaged in a PLASTIC container. Plastic can leech into the product. What is the point of putting a health food in contaminating packaging? Change it! Glass is far more acceptable, and will not will not contaminate the product with the estrogens from plastic. We people who use coconut oil will definitely recycle it, like we do everything else.;)"
4,Great Product!,I received this product in a timely fashion and it tastes better that any other coconut product I have ever tried. I gave it 4 stars because the lid was cracked but the plastic protective coating was on the product so I kept it! I will definitely be re-ordering!
5,Good stuff,"This stuff is the bomb! Good for you, great taste, great value. Best brand out there, IMO. A must have for healthy eating."
5,Always stocked in my house,"I love the buttery taste/texture of this coconut oil. We use it for everything from baking to sauteing to just whipping up a frosting or homemade ""buttery"" spread. It does have a coconut inspired flavor, so if you are looking for total neutrality, another brand may be best."
5,I Love This Stuff!,"Actually, I'm on my 3rd jar of this Coconut Oil. I use it in cooking, in my coffee, and on my skin. In fact, this oil has cleared up problems that I have had on my cheeks, little white bumps, almost completely!I love sauteing chicken in the oil as it helps keep it moist and also has a delicious flavor with the chicken; a plus are that the pan scrapings are delish! :) I also add a teaspoon to each cup of coffee I drink. I don't use sugar for sweetening but do use half and half but have found that I need less cream when I add the oil. I started using a tablespoon but that was too much in that I almost couldn't leave the house, if you know what I mean.There is a book I reviewed about coconut oil too so if you are a ""coconut oil beginner"", I suggest reading the book I reviewed as it has a lot of useful information."
5,"Excellent product , Excellent value.","It is the best tasting coconut oil/butter I have had in the 6 years of using coconut oil. I have tried about 5 different brands, this ends my search. The best on whole grain raisin bread toast. It is great to find a product that is so good for you. I don't use coconut oil for frying or saute but I will add at the end of certain dishes. My family adds to shakes, smoothies , fish dishes, baked goods, different ethnic dishes, Thai, Indian. Great hair and skin conditioner. And this price is hard to beat."
3,Tastes great; is it really healthy?,"Love the taste, great for stir frys as well as a great additive to smoothies. I'm in two minds over the health issue though; searching medical journals only seems to show a vast majority of negative results (this stuff *is* mostly saturated fat after all) with a huge number of hits on sites which frankly sell this stuff. I don't know but I felt the need to balance all the glowlingly positive reviews...they jury is still out on whether this stuff really is good for you (hydrogenated coconut oil certainly isn't...this stuff is hopefully different)"
2,specific taste,"i bought this but don't usually use it. the coconut oil has a distinct smell and flavor that sometimes overpowers the food. i won't buy it again, but thought i would give it a try."
5,favorite coconut oil,"In 1892, pathologist William Osler described a whitish area on a heart, the telltale sign of myocardial infarction. In hundreds of thousands of autopsies over two centuries, none had been found before. As consumption of vegetable oils increased, heart attacks became increasingly common. By 1930 they were the leading cause of death in America.I prefer the fats that people ate for thousands of years before the epidemic. Nutiva smells good and can be spooned in winter. It's cheaper than some brands. Large jars are practical because it stays fresh on the shelf for many months after opening."
1,Container,"We use coconut oil for literally EVERYTHING. We use it for cooking, skin care, hair care, baby bum care...everything! We saw this and thought it was a great deal. It would be a great deal if it were in Glass. However, it is packaged in #1 plastic! A big FAIL for this company. #1 plastic leaches antimony and phthalates. No thank you! We avoid traditional products specifically to avoid those, and other such chemicals!If you're a fan of glass, go with Spectrum or Tropical Traditions! Though, I've only bought their smaller containers."
3,"""Hollywood-Style""","We liked the book Bend it like Beckham"" . It's a funny book which is easy to read and to understand. But we think it's too much ""Hollywood-Style"". The happy end is too obvious almost like a fairy-tale really.We liked the film, too, for the same reason as the book. It doesn't matter if you read the book or watch the film first, because it's one story. It's an instruction for you how to handle your parents and maybe your friends and to realize your dreams.I think the film is about an Indian girl who want to life her dreams. But it's difficult for her to live like a normal English girl because of her parents and her culture. Jess loves to play football and while she realizes her dream to play professionally she finds new friends and learns a lot about life."
1,Difficult to set up,"Difficult to set up on uneven surfaces,.and never never drop the alarm,it is definitely not a timex! broken broken broken. Do not waste your money. Buy a freaking set of bells and stick that on your door window etc."
5,Sense of God's Presence,This is a wonderful song & message to the people of Hawaii! I was blessed while listening. I could sense God's Presence.
4,E Ala E,"The selection of music appears to be for his own people adding to my personal enjoyment and appreciation of the native Hawaiian people. I enjoy listening to all of the tunes in this collection.The only comment is that the recording engineer used to much gain when recording and I have to reduce all frequencies when playing this and other IZ Discs the I have purchased thru Amazon.Especially the highs and mids or his voice comes out sort of ""tinny""."
1,Sizing stupidity,"As others have mentioned here, it's ridiculous that Plantronics forces its customers to purchase a replacement set of 3 different sizes, when all I needed was replacing the broken ear piece of the size I obviously know is the correct one for me. Why not offer packages with 3 ear gels of the same size, instead of forcing customers to order two sizes they don't need, in order to get the one that fits. Absolutely outrageous! For this idiocity I'm giving it only one star, although obviously, the product itself is OK."
5,Plantronics Ear tips,These are exact replacments and work fine. The only drawback is you can't buy just the size you need. You have to buy a pack with three different sizes.
5,Absolute Addiction,Russell Crowes' voice is mesmerizing and it just seems like you can't get enought of it. I took the cd to work and everyone that listened to it just couldn't stop. I have listened to BLOC more times in the few weeks that I have had it than I've listened to any of my other cds that I had for years! Everyone agreed that TOFOG needs to be heard in the USA!!
5,brilliant,"this is the best cd i have ever heard, pity the band dont get their music aired as much as it should be hopefully they will eventually get recognised over here in the uk.pure dead brilliant"
4,"Very Good ""Darker Than Black"" Installment - Recommended","This is the 5th DVD in the ""Darker Than Black"" series. Since this DVD contains episodes 19 - 22, I recommend starting onDarker Than Black: Volume Oneas there is a lot of backstory not explained in these episodes.These are actually 2, two part episodes that continue to develop Hei (AKA: BK201, The Black Reaper) and the rest of his team (especially Yin, the ""Doll""). We also start to see some more insights into ""The Syndicate"" (the group Hei works for) and the shadowy Pandora organization.There is a lot more plot development in these two chapters and great action. As before, the animation ranges between very good to very bad.Recommended! The next DVD can be orderedDarker Than Black: Volume 6"
1,Hate THEM!,"In a word JUNK! Not made well and the function is not at all ""quick detachable"" I will only use the stainless lugs and nothing else. Not worth 5 bucks."
4,Karen's review of Madonna's debut,"This is a really great effort for a debut album!Lucky Star: wonderful dance song; Up-beat love songs are always goodBorderline: Her first top 10 hit. Good song about a girl in a bad relationship.Burning Up: I guess you could call this one her first 'sexy' song.I Know It: This is a great song about heartbreak.Holiday: Well what can I say about this classic song? It's the only song that she's performed in all 5 of her main tours. Wonderul meaning, and it's great to dance to.Think Of Me: This song is not as good the others, but it's alright.Physical Attraction: I didn't like this one too much at first, but then it grew on me.Everybody: Well, this was her first single ever. The one that started it all. It's very flirtatious."
3,Dancecore Madonna,"Madonna's debut is a remarkable dance album with a sound of its own, influenced by but not slavishly reflecting the dance/club styles of the early 1980s. Her voice is down in the mix but this works somehow. The best tracks include Lucky Star, Borderline, Holiday and the harder-edged Burning Up. I somehow cannot imagine that most fans of her subsequent albums would like this one very much, as it's so different from her later pop vocal style. My main complaint is the lack of variety, but the aforementioned songs do have melodic appeal."
3,Good Release but not the best I've used,"My wife and I have used this release for several hunts. She is the person in the picture I submitted shooting her bow. Fits well, feels good on the wrist, and has a good touch. However, my copy ended up locking up and did not function properly in the middle of my annual Mule Deer hunt in Montana. Luckily I had a back up release. I've only used Scott releases since this incidence and they are built like a tank."
1,Waste of money,"First of all the item pictured is not what you get. Secondly, if it lasts six months, you've done great. Find your product elsewhere, this is junk."
3,Good but not outstanding,"I first became familiar with Moreno on the Brazillian Melt compilation CD for the track ""Deusa do Amor"", which is one of my favourite tunes of the moment. The CD is interesting enough and has various moods.It might take a couple of listens to really appreciate all of the subtleties of the CD but it is something worth taking the time to appreciate. I'll be watching his career progress just like Ms. Bebel Gilberto."
5,Sister can't live with out it!,From time to time I buy this tea for my sister who can't drink coffee because it makes her sick. She loves the taste of this tea and drinks it every single day!
1,Empire of the Many Plots,"Jean Reno is pretty fun if not on the edge of crazy and dark, although his part is more of a supporting role. The movie suffers from too many sub plot points all trying to rule the empire of being the major plot point. A little horror nightmarish, a little Jason Bourne, a little Fringe. If they stuck to one of these, the movie could have been better. Unfortunately it doesn't.If you're looking for Jean Reno films, this one is a ""maybe-catch-it-on-TV-sometime"" viewing. Won't miss too much.Also, in terms of family friendliness, it is rated R and for good reason. Some grisly dark violent scenes, as well as nudity and language."
4,Good..,"Since I am a big fan of Mr. Aron Hall this album is not ""the best"" than the first one. This album it is not bad at all there is some songs need to listen very carefully, and time will tell you how these songs are really good. Nevertheless it was worth waiting for the artist to come back into the market."
5,Twila Paris's BEST CD,"I have owned several copies of this particular CD and over the years have worn them out! This recording has some of her BEST songs. This time, I converted to MP3, so I will own it forever!"
4,Clear and Distinct,"This is a very helpful book, It is concise, yet it explains difficult points well. Best of all is that the typesetting is original, and easy on the eyes."
4,Third Time's a Charm,"""Turn up the Zydeco"", the third outing for Rockin' Dopsie Jr. and the Zydeco Twisters, is the most eclectic yet for this group. Since assuming the helm of the band on the passing of his father (Zydeco legend Alton ""Rockin' Dopsie"" Rubin), bandleader and rubboard player David Rubin (Rockin' Dopsie Jr.) has successfully blended even more elements of contemporary r&b, jazz, and classic rock n' roll, while maintaining the infectious dance rhythms that is the hallmark of Zydeco music. High points of the CD are the band's covers of the Zydeco standards ""Hot Tamale Baby"" and ""Zydeco Boogaloo"" showcasing accordionist Anthony (Tiger Dopsie) Rubin's electric riffs. If you've been curious about zydeco but have had limited exposure, this album will serve as an excellent eye-opener - and don't be surprised if you get the urge to zydeco dance halfway through the first track."
5,A Very Good Concert,"She's very good, if a little too rehearsed sounding; Tony Jackson is, as always, a gas; Simon Phillips is why I bought this disc. He is a total monster in this show.A must have...."
2,Oy what a downer,"Violent and pointless. It will make you afraid to step foot in NYC, with it's portrayal of random street and subway violence. Also, Nicky Katt, one of my fave actors, has just a bit role."
4,Good movie,Worth the watch. If you like Jodie Foster and Terrance Howard you will enjoy seeing them play these rolls. Enjoy.
5,Brave One,"This movie is excellent!!! As usual, Jodie Foster gives a stellar performance. This is one of the best movies I have seen in a long time and the characters are well drawn. I highly recommend this movie."
5,Brave One DVD,Excellent as usual for Foster. She never ceases to amaze me on her choices of scripts. She knows intinctively what she can do well and does it each and everytime. This has an interesting ending. I am a diehard fan forever.
5,One of Jodie foster's best,This is a really good movie. Kind of dark but still really good. Jodie Foster does an excellent job in this.
4,Liked it so much I'm going to buy it again,"I have had this hard drive for over a year and been very happy with it. It is quiet and fast. However, I recently had a puppy get tangled in the USB cable and pull it off the desk, where it went splat on the floor. In case you are wondering, the answer is ""no, your hard drive will not survive a drop to the floor without damaging your data"". :)"
3,lame software,"I left this running overnight to do an unattended backup of 12 GB. After 2.7 GB, it stopped because a path name was too long for the destination drive. I had foolishly kept the default E:/Retrospective Duplicates/... but one long path name shouldn't crash the whole operation -- any decent piece of software would skip over the offending directory and keep going with the remainder of the backup."
5,For that perfect glow in winter.,"Ever since I first swirled, tapped, and buffed this makeup onto my face, I have been a devout user of Bare Escentuals makeup. As a pale and freckled redhead, so much make-up makes it look like I am trying to either cover my freckles, change my skin tone, or both. Since I am so pale, I find it necessary to ""spice up"" my skin a bit to keep it from seeming too drab. In the summer, a light bronzer works great, but in the winter that looks a little off. Enter Clear Radiance. It doesn't add color, but it does add a little shine and shimmer that gives me a healthy glow. It is an essential part of my face's winter wardrobe and I definately think you should give it a try. If you have a darker complexion than I (pretty much everyone) this might make a good summer option as well."
5,Nice blush product,"I have tried many blush products and find the colors too intense, harsh. This product you can have as much color as you like."
1,Bunk set,"This is a collection of probably the worst songs the Kinks ever recorded. Covering the seventies and eighties, the cd coordinator managed to find obscure songs not worth hearing to recognizable dial changers. Huge waste of money. Once you open it you're stuck with it."
2,"im not completely satisfied, honestly i wasted the money.","it does the job, but it doesnt do the job well. its not a sharp reflection, i figured that it would be a strong refelction, the adhesive side has more reflection then the plastic side."
4,One of the greats :-),"This cd has all the hits on it. From Mary Jane to SuperFreak to Give It To Me Baby, this contains all his best music and it reminds me exactly how great he was. If you are a fan of funk and of Rick, then this is for you. Even now, all of the songs are still tight and this is an enjoyable cd to blast out of the car or anywhere really. I love it."
5,One of Cody's Very Best,This is an incredible treat. Not a mystery like her later work but an advventure story and a study of what happens when a person is gradually removed from everything familiar. To what lengths will a person go to stay alive? This is a great read.
4,"Great Product, good price, shippping a bit high.....","I was able to save 2 out of my 4 palm trees that had potassium defeciency. The product seemed to work well for the 2 trees that survived... I would recomend it especailly for the price, but shipping is a little high..."
4,not for kindergartners,"The book had a good story line. I was trying to introduce my kindergartener to chapter books. She's at a 2nd grade reading level and I wanted to raise her vocabulary level. She remebered the show that goes with the book. She liked the book but said she didn't understand alot of the words, and she didn't have the patience to read the book all in one sitting. Definitely this book is for the older child who has more patience."
4,Funny.,"My 5 year old daughter really enjoyed reading this book on her own. She found it interesting and funny. Sometimes she couldn't understand about the fight (her words). However, she read it quickly and wanted to read more of these Arthur books."
2,Nothing special,"Generic country...nothing special. I borrowed this from the library, and I 'm glad I didn't pay money for it."
1,Honky Tonk Angel: The Intimate Story of Patsy Cline,I can't review at this time. Still waiting for order to come in.
5,sinatra,"sinatra sings the wonderful rodgers, hart. they wrote so many stand out songs and what can you say about sinatras renditions.. his voice was closest thing we have to perfection, and the phrasing.. at his best he could transport you to another world."
2,"Good art, terrible lesson","My stepdaughter received this book from a friend and tonight was the first night I had a chance to read it... and I was quite disappointed at what I found. I was unsure as to why this book kept mentioning how small a bumblebee's wings are until I got to the page where it claimed that bumblebees couldn't fly. I skipped a beet, and hastily continued the book filling in what it said with a more accurate description of how bumblebees fly (their ability to fly is quite interesting, as it relates to how air behaves more like a fluid at the bumblebees scale).I don't expect much from a children's picture book, but I do expect at least a passing attempt at accuracy."
2,Read the entire description,Make sure and read the entire description.........something I did not do. This product does not work for a combination tv-dvd playerwhich is the product for which it was purchased. I've now returned it.
4,Easy-Peasy,Worked the first time! no trouble. My only wish is that it were slightly smaller. It is wide for my small hand. It works so I am happy.
2,Wrong pressure plate,The kit I received had the correct clutch disc and throwout bearing but the wrong pressure plate. I got the 10 inch disc but the pressure plate was the larger one for an 11 inch disc. I reused the old pressure plate. Most likely a packaging error.
4,Baby loves it,"We installed this mobile on our changing table, and our little girl loves it. She's fascinated by the bold images and seems to enjoy the sounds. At first we thought the volume was a little low (you can't adjust it), but when it's close to baby's head--as in changing table or crib--it's just right. (By comparison the Fisher Price Lights and Sounds Aquarium seems very loud.)"
2,Had to return it twice,"If it were reliable it would be perfect. This mobile is not well made. It was one of my daughters favorite toys, she loved to lie in her crib at watch it spin. However, after a month or two it stopped spinning, even with brand new batteries. We returned it for another one, which lasted a little bit longer but inevitably suffered the same fate. I will not ever buy another Sassy mobile again. The remote is terrific though, it goes around a door knob so we could just reach our hand in and hit a button to start it up, or stop it."
4,"never thought this would be a 'must have', but it is!","My daughter's face lights up when this mobile is on. I am very happy that there are different songs to choose from, that the music isn't 'tinny' sounding, and that the designs can be switched around to keep her interest. the batteries seem to last well, too.We wound up putting this on her changing table, as the base couldn't be screwed onto her crib - the position of the holding screw won't allow it to fasten to a railing top more than about 2 inches tall, and the tops of her Emily crib are three inches tall. As a result, we haven't used the remote control feature, but we've been happy with this mobile regardless."
4,appealing and sturdy (but a bit loud),My son loves this mobile. Downward facing shapes...OF COURSE! Why aren't more mobiles oriented this way? Spin and pause feature is great and the music is pretty good BUT the volume is too loud. We had to put tape over our speaker. A volume control knob would be invaluable since all kids are different and even one baby's needs change at different times of day.
1,Not so thrilled,"After reading the high praises for this mobile, I thought it would be a good choice. Yes, the ornaments are colorful and useful after taking it down, but I was concerned about the glue reisdue on the edges of the one I bought.Also, the music is REALLY bad. I'm just going to use the music/vibrator from my Jeep playyard. It's sounds are truly realistic and not static-sounding (the ""ocean"") or so cheap sounding.Besides, several of my friends say their babies are more enthralled with the ceiling fan than their mobiles."
1,Mobile stopped Rotating after 2 weeks,"I read many reviews and decided to get this one from Sassy. First of all, we could not get the batteries to go in. So we went to BRU and exchanged the 1st one. This new one we got 3 weeks ago.I used it about 20-30 mins every day for 2 weeks and I must say that my daughter loved it. I liked the fact that it had a working remote and the music played for a long time.After 2 weeks of slight use the mobile stopped rotating. I gave it a few small taps and it started to rotate again. But a few days later it stopped again. It wont start rotating even after a tap any more. This is going back it to the store."
2,Good mobile if and When it works,We purchsed the mobile because it was automatic and same with a remote. After about two weeks it only worked on ocasion and when it did work it would squek. Very annoying to us and our baby. If the problem was fixed or fixable I would recommend this product.
2,Godd idea needs work,I received this as a shower gift for my fourth child. With all my years of being a mom (13) I have never seen so much plastic junk for $29.99. I took it out of the box and the paint is chipped off the inside of all the toys. I installed it just to see how it works and yes the motor is louder than the music. There is no way of adjusting the volume and the ocean does not sound real either. The housing is also made of very thin cheap plastic. My opinion: There are many others to choose from that are developmental. Sassy get back to the drawing borad!
2,Save money for a better mobile- FROM 3rd time mommy,"I just got this yesterday and after I put it together (almost hurting myself) and putting the batteries in, I was completely disappointed at the end result. I spent better money on ""regular"" mobiles with my other two children and will be returning this for one of those. Considering the money spent on this and the money spent on batteries, you would think the music could play a little louder and that the toys would actually go around on a regular basis, instead of once around every minute or so."
1,problem with Music in Motion Developmental Mobile w/remote,"I have sent 2 messages regarding this product. My daughter received the mobile, but when she put it on the baby's crib the music on the mobile played, but the mobile did not rotate. Even though the product was NEW, there is something wrong with the motor. Please advise us as to what we should do to return this product. My daughter through out the packing box and only has the box the mobile came in, so we don't have an address to return it to. Please advise.You have my name and e-mail address. Thank you for your assistance. Marie Goodmabn"
2,Pass on this one,"Don't buy this mobile. The remote is a nice feature and does work, but is the only redeeming feature. There is no volume control, the mobile stops often which is too long for a baby, and most irritating of all, the music is electronic/harpsichord sounding - I don't remember that being on the box as a feature."
5,Great Movie,"The ""Manster"" is one of the best wierd, hilarious, Japanese monster movies of all time. I first saw it when I was 16; I've been watching it ever since and I'm now 61. This is worthy of a collection right along with ""Godzilla""."
3,"50"" LG with DVR","We bought a 50"" LG Plasma (the one with the built-in DVR) and had to send it back. The recorder would not let you watch one digital channel while recording another. The on-screen guide (ours was from TV Guide) was ridiculously hard to follow (it sorted channels by name, not by number--unless you want to dive into the menu and manually reassign each channel a new number), and because the guide didn't use local programming, we had several recorded shows that simply had a few minutes lopped off on either end of the program. We had the set traded out for a similar model with no DVR. We'll see how that works."
5,New Country music fan,"Due to 2 surgeries to my right foot, I ended up with alot of time to spend stuck in my bed with my foot elevated. I had recently moved and found a HBO concert I had taped in 1997. It was Garth Brooks in Central Park. I played it and it reminded me how much I enjoyed his voice. You can tell how much he loves to sing and entertain his audience. It's written all over his face. You can't fake that. So I bought more Garth and also Trisha Yearwood, Martina McBride and Reba. There were many nights I could not sleep. After listening to Garth or Trisha or Martina and the wonderful stories that is country music I would finally relax enough to sleep."
5,Excellent,Faith is a wonderful singer and through her music we can feel her pain and see how much of a proud mother of three she has become. Faith you are an inspiration to a lot of young mother's and with God's presence I wish her continued sucess. The album is HOT and I recommend everyone to have a copy because we have all been there too!
5,Keep the Faith,Her first CD and I loved it but was not able to find it until now . ThanksBrenda Conley
2,THIS CD IS WEAK!!!,"I LOVED Faith Evan's first cd. However, I was disappointed in her lastest, ""Keep the Faith"". This album definitely puts me to sleep. The only song that I liked was ""Love Like This"". All the other songs completely disenchanted me. If you are a Faith Evan's fan and haven't bought the cd yet, I would suggest downloading sound waves or listening to someone else's cd."
2,a good behind the scenes artist,as a writer she is alright but vocally she still seems to be a mary j clone.the album doesn't go anywhere it's typical puffy infested material.very run of the mill.
3,She is not Queen of Hip-Hop Soul- Tasha,"First of all I would like to say that I like Faith First album, Now her second one is good. I would give her that much. But don't compare her to Whitney please, she never did what whitney did or still do. Now Faith can singin the studio but not live, I heard her sing twice and she mess my song up. Iam not saying that you suppose to sound the same way but please. Faith is the only one that I know that has Three baby daddies, that is nasty, I don't care what the circumstance are. All I could say about Mary and Faith is, Faith is not called The Queen of Hip-Hop Soul.And If she is all that , how come it took her along time to go platinum. She O.K. but not the best."
4,Faith has done a great job,"I haven't heard the entire album , but the few songs I have heard are great. Faith bounced back like a pro after all of the personal problems she had to overcome during the past couple years and it is truly reflected in this CD."
5,A Blessing,"This CD is one of the best that a female artists has released. Faith Evans goes beyond the limit that she did on her first CD. I applaud her for her strength, courage, and her faith. The CD is one that has a song for every situation possible; ""Keep the Faith"" was made for me; listening to this song gives me courage to continue on with life and to be the best that I can be. Thank you Faith Evans--May God Bless You!"
2,Dead pages on Deadwood,"As the previous reviewers have said, this book is amateurish at best. Large type and large margins make each page about a paragraph. The writer repeats the same scant info over and over and never really delves into anything with substance. If you want inane references to the HBO series and other non-facts this is the book for you or your 5 year old. I read this book in under two hours and at the end it give the authors bio, if he is a scholar then I am Deadwood Dick!"
4,"Very good, but too complete for what I needed","I wanted something like basic English usage and punctuation in publications. I guess I thought since I did proofing I needed something more. This book was it, but not for me."
3,Could be a lot better,"My kid bought me this b/c I do a lot of online editing. Truthfully, I have found more answers on Google than in this handbook."
5,Wow,"Be prepared to have your mind blown! This is some of the most fantastic music I have experienced since the Nixon administration. These guys are incredible, the interplay and blending of genres is awesome. Mectapus are genius and should be given the Nobel Peace Prize and eleceted supreme rulers of the universe. I want to be them."
1,"Looks cute, but it's just cheesy.","Fortunately, this product is ""currently unavailable."" Should it ever become available again, do yourself a favor: avoid it. It looks like it might be a decent little iPod player that one could fold up and carry from home to work to vacation spots or whatever. If you were able to listen to it before buying it, you'd realize that it's just not good enough quality for any of these purposes. Tinny, weak sound. Way, way overpriced. Too bad I had to choose even a single star to rate it."
4,as good as the later discs,"This disc is now remastered, I think that True Blue marks a turning point to those discs before it,and the discs after.(up to Music) It shows a mature confident Madonna ready to take on the world in a new way,this is seen by the progression afterwards.Anyway with out being to technical there are some fine pop tunes ,especially the controversial ""Papa Don't Preach"",And the ballad ""Live to Tell"",and my favorite ""True Blue"".This disc also has a two tracks of extra remixes of ""True Blue"", And ""La Isla Bonita"" The later a great song performed in concert(not on this disc) for those lucky ones out there who get to see her. This is definitely a must have for any Madonna or pop fan. Ant. ..."
5,Her best CD ever!,"This was for me her finest moment in music. It is the only CD from her I can still listen to today. Songs like ""Papa don't preach"", Open your heart"", ""Live to tell"", ""Where's the Party"", ""True Blue"", and my favorite ""La Ilso Bonita"" make this a true treat!!"
4,Madonna Gift,I bought this cd as a gift for my sister's birthday coming up.I myself listened to the music and think my sister will be pleased with the gift I have bought for her! Great sounding cd by Madonna!
2,Pretty Average,Papa Don't Preach is a CLassic Madonna Song Period.Nothing really else matches that Vibe.La ISla Bonita is a Good Solid Track.Live To Tell was a Alright Track but played way too Much.She Struck a Major Chord on a Slow Cut a Year Prior with Crazy 4 U.Live to Tell is a 2nd Tier Version of that.She has Her trademark Sound GOing On with producer Patrick Leonard&Steven Bray(who was with Her from the Group The Breakfast Club&they had a Couple Of Hits Around the time this Album came out)&the Samples of James Cagney's Voice.Nothing Overall Too get Excited About.Madonna Formula.I Still Dig the Songs that I mentioned&the Album Cover but Overall Forgettable.
4,"An inspiring, powerful CD","This CD is a marked improvement over their debut Beautiful Freak, which itself was pretty wonderful in its own rights. The CD shows the emotional turmoil that was going on in E's life over the past year, with family members leaving him one after the other. But like only E can, he manages to sing about death and still consistently put a smile on the listener's face (check out the loungy Hospital Food and rock-on Cancer For The Cure). It is the clash and contrast of the two emotions of mournful and light-hearted that give this album such beauty and power. The Eels have consistently been able to accomplish this, and it never fails to inspire. Simply beautiful stuff."
2,a fair CD,"I bought this cd pretty much just for last stop:this town ( witch is a great song). The cd is sort of deperssing. Im am sure i will discover this cd's magic some time and love it deerly, but it is not the case right now. ps. go with beautafl freak"
3,The weakest Divine Comedy album ever-but still good,"It can't really be called an album-it's more of an EP. The first two songs (In Pursuit, Everybody Knows) are the standout ones, and everything else feels a bit too 'NeiL Hannon'-ish. Having said that, it's still worth buying."
3,Good but....,I thought that this book had all the making of a five star. Once I arrive upon the conclusion of this book I still wanted more. The end was no end it left me in limbo and wanting about five or six more chapters. The story line was excellent but it came to a screeching halt. And lest just say that I don't like that feeling.I think that if you are a reader who likes to make your one conclusion then this book is for you.
4,Start you journey here.,"In short, this is a great band, and a great album, and a live jam is the best way to hear them. If you're thinking of hitting ""Lollapalooza 2004"", give this a few spins before you go. You'll be glad you did."
5,The next Big Thing,"This is an amazing CD. The recording is a little rough, and is sometimes tough to hear, but that is the only flaw. High points include ""San Jose"" and ""Walk this Way."" They have everything from keyboards to mandolins to violins. Buy this thing. You too will realize that The Incident plays a style all their own and are on their way to becoming one of the next great bands."
3,Watch Out for Zacks Spam,"I learned a lot from this book about how earnings momentum is used to buy and sell stocks. Basically, momentum investors are looking for impending earnings surprises of a certain quality.The book then induces you to try out the Zacks online service and get their daily earnings updates and eletters like ""Profit from the Pros"". Don't do it. Signing up will unleash a torrent of spam from Zacks for many of their services. I have unsubscribed numerous times and even emailed their customer service department. They did respond but I still get the crap. Even worse, they gave my name to a marketing partner and now I get even more garbage."
3,Useful but Self Promotional,"The author makes valid points about the role of analysts in affecting stock prices. He certainly understands analysts and explains how to relate rationally to their recommendations.However, he could have made the same points in one fifth the number of pages. He seems to be one of the many authors who have no respect for their readers` time.If and when you skim this book, you will also be faced with the task of filtering out all of Zack's self promotion."
2,Poor quality,"These wipes are not worth out, even at half the price. Take a paper towel and spray a little Armour-All on it and it works better for pennies."
4,GREAT COST!!,"I have had this product on my wish list for over a year, but would not purchase it for the cost ($69.00) at a competitive home decor store. With the daily emails from Amazon it appeared at such a reduced cost I could not pass up. More than half off from the other store. When it arrived, I was very pleased and it now looks gorgeous in my living room. The large one sits in front of my red sofa serving as a coffee table/ottoman and the smaller one is in front of a beige barrell chair with red, brown & white circles. It really works great with the decor and I can't believe the savings. It does pay off to purchase through Amazon...they know how to get it right. Thanks and keep up with the great bargains!!"
2,Looks nice. Dangerous?,"It's a nice product at an excellent price. But it smells a bit. And I'm alarmed at the suggestion that the smell may represent ""cancer-causing chems"", as one reviewer suggests.On the whole, I'm a bit uncomfortable with the purchase."
2,Global Dis_STINK_tions? TEXT BOOK CASE OF 'BUYER BEWARE' HEALTH RISKS TRUMPED BY BARGIN PRICE,"(added several months later.. I TRULY CAN'T BELIEVE THAT PEOPLE ARE STILL BUYING THIS PRODUCT AFTER ALL OF THE REVIEWS EXPRESSING ALARM ABOUT THE PERVASIVE CHEMICAL SMELL- THIS MAY BECOME A TEXT BOOK CASE OF 'BUYER BEWARE' HEALTH RISKS TRUMPED BY BARGIN PRICE..Look at all of the reviews that continue to mention the pervasive and lingering chemical smell of poorly cured Chinese vinyl that comes with this bargain price.Consider that if you can smell something then that chemical is already in your brain. I am not so sure I can rest easy, feet propped up on this Ottoman without being concerned with the irony within the company name, Global DiStinKtions.Suggest an extra dose of your favorite anti-oxidant remedies to ward off potential untold health hazards?"
4,Buy one get one free title misleading,"I bought this ottoman set when it was listed as ""buy one get one free ottoman set"". So I assumed I'd be getting TWO sets for the price of one. But no, it's buy one ottoman and another, different, smaller ottoman comes inside.The ottomans are nice, I wanted two storage ottomans but I got just the one with the smaller non-storage one inside.It's nice that they are leather and not pleather. But they smell strongly of chemicals, so I have them out in the garage out-gassing until they smell less. Chemical smells like that give me a headache so I can't have them inside until they smell less.Otherwise. Good purchase for the price. I paid $40, I guess they were listed a $100-something, which would NOT have been worth it."
3,Wow the price jumped,"Bought these back in 2008 for $27 bucks. Would rate them 5 stars off of that purchase, but to see them at $100 after shipping today I would have to think there's better options out there.These have stood the test of time and do not show a ton of wear. The large one is sturdy and the flippable top is handy and the space inside can be utilized well (I currently keep ""shot"" checkers game in there but its large enough for a couple of blankets or such)The smaller one is pretty close to useless because its really small and pretty low to the ground, sometimes it just seems in the way really.If you can snag these for say $50 after shipping, I'd say go for it, but $100??? no way."
3,Does yours smell too? Keep reading...,"Excellent product for the price. Great value.Yes, they smell. Yours will too. Here's what you do:1. Take some 5% acidity vinegar and dilute with water (4 to 1, water to vinegar mix).2. Put some on a cloth so it's damp and completely wipe all of the vinyl surfaces of both ottomans.3. Rinse cloth, repeat step 2.4. With a clean damp cloth (just water this time), wipe once more and let dry.Entire process took me 10 minutes. They no longer smell. Did not discolor."
4,ottoman,"As with many reviews, I was pleased with this item. Unfortunately I am one of the unlucky ones that have the bad smell. After a week and a runny nose, I have put it outside to ""air out"". I think it might be the chemicals used in the tanning process."
4,Better than expected,"I ordered these for Xmas for my husband. After reading about the smell in other reviews, I was a bit hesitant, and when we unpacked them they did have an odor. It was a chemical smell, but it wasn't to bad. A week later, I can still smell it if I am really close. That's the only complaint. They are sturdy and nice=looking. I have a 3-year-old bouncing all over them, and so far, so good. I think they were definitely worth the price."
5,Great value for TWO ottomans,"This was the best price I could find anywhere for a storage ottoman..plus the top that becomes a tray is great. The second ottoman is a great bonus. Most other storage ottomans are the same or close to same price and don't include either of these added ""bonuses"". No chemical smell with ours. It is in my college daughter's (rather small) bedroom apartment and works great as a multifunctional piece. Looks more expensive than it is."
3,good price - quality not so much,We just got this about 2 weeks ago. Already the threads are fraying on the smaller ottoman. I would love this if it would stay together!
3,What can I say that hasn't already been said?,"The price for the B1G1F ottoman was right at $39.99, especially considering similar items in local B&M stores were $69.99 and up. I purchased the black set and was disappointed on two counts. Firstly, I had believed, inappropriately so, that the two ottomans were the same size. Secondly, although I had read about the odor of the ottomans, I don't think I was quite prepared for the chemical scent that it had. I received the ottomans shortly before Christmas. They remain in my cold garage open and with dryer sheets inside, in the hopes that they might be permitted to enter the house before Spring! They are cute and functional, and I have just the place for them."
1,Purchase at your own risk...,They look good. They smell bad. They've been airing out on my patio for 5 weeks now; they still smell. Got 'em for cheap; returning not worth it. Hopefully they'll be aired out by spring. Buyer beware...
3,ottoman,"Nice ottomans, however has an insecticide odor. Have been airing them out for almost 2 weeks now. Not sure if this is product or something sprayed in delivery truck."
3,Ottoman,"Great value. Easy to move around for extra seating. Bonus storage in the larger one. BUT. . .beware the smell inside the storage compartment. Even after airing outside and spraying with an odor neutralizer, their is still a noticeable ""synthetic"" smell which makes me wonder if it is ""off gassing"" something I wouldn't want to be exposed to frequently. And I don't really want a blanket that I might pull up to my chin to smell like that."
5,Fantastic buy,"We ordered two ottomans, they were delivered in a couple of days,packed in boxes separately and also plastic to protect them, there were not any bad odors as we read about other ottomans. They look more expensive and good quality. We use them as a coffee tables , storage a foot rest, they are light weight to move around the room.We are very happy with the purchase."
3,good enough,"The smell took way too long to dissipate for me. It was a headache. I do like the look, and the tray top, but I might save up for real leather next. My 2 boys have already pulled off the small ottoman's underside covering. They are a bit rowdy and rough, but what boy isn't? It has to withstand them or doesn't get my vote! For the price, and the quality, it was good, not great."
4,Mambo,I remember listening to this on my folks' hi fi when I was growing up. It is as impressive as it was then and fun to listen to now.
2,"Not Yma's best, but the Kaluah ad is on it!","If you don't know Yma Sumac you are missing a rare treat. But start with ""Voice of the Xataby."" Sensational in every way. What a voice! Then buy her greatest hits! The Kaluah ad music is on that, too."
3,Seagal w/o trademark moves,"In this sequel to ""The Foreigner,"" Steven Seagal returns as freelance agent Jonathan Cold. This time his mission is to thwart a cell of Chechen terrorists scheming to detonate a nuke in Los Angeles. The story concept promises excitement but fails to deliver. Maybe Mr. Seagal believes he's getting ""too old"" for martial arts movies, or maybe he's decided to redirect his genre from action to suspense. Because, while Agent Cold is apparently not ""too old"" for his young female partner, the film is disappointingly short on action. Specifically, the trademark Aikido fighting moves that made Seagal famous. Cold defeats the Chechens with brainpower and firepower; not a bad thing, just not what this viewer was expecting. The interesting and somewhat convoluted plot can't really carry the film for fans of Seagal's former martial arts mayhem."
2,not the greatest,he has done better. to much gun play in this one. prefer some of his other movies to where there was one on one combat.
2,Good to go to sleep to,Me and my wife watched it and it is not your common StevenSeagall movie. We found it very boring. Not much hand to hand combat.
4,Whoa!,"This is a marvelously encouraging album; B.B. clearly demonstrates no desire to rest on past accomplishments and goes back to his roots for some real blues. No guests, no slick pop numbers, no coasting. It's great when someone has nothing to prove, then proves his worth anyway. That said, this is not his best (just trying to put the reins on some of those over-enthusiastic five-star reviews!). His guitar playing and singing certainly are not that of his prime. Let's have some perspective here. Still and all, a very fine album you should make a part of your collection."
5,An instant classic!!,B.B. has done it again! This is my favorite B.B.King CD. It is mellow listening but still gives you that feeling of understanding. I've never heard a blues guitar played so softly. Thanks B.B.! Can't wait for the next one!
5,The King on His Throne,"B.B. King has always follwed his roots, at times he may wander a little(Not on this cd) to find what is good. He went strictly ""back to basics""And we get to hear what he has always known ""The Blues"".Thank you Mr. King"
2,Not your usual Oakenfold CD,Whoops... probably should have read a bit more about this one first. Simply put- it's a collection of two to three minute samples and breakbeats that would be great if you were mixin'- but it's not something you can kick back and listen to.
4,Blueberry,"This is a good tasting product, but it must be toasted, They taste funny right out of the package."
1,brian wilson as bad as you could imagine,"OMG I awsted 5 dollars on these two discs brian couldnt sing with the beach boys in the sixties and its very sad to see him trying to sing now and his band is as bad as it gets where did he pick up these rejects? Brian was a drugged out loser who wanted to be as good as the beatles but couldnt shine their shoes as far as creativity goes he uses old cliches as mrs olearys cow and you are my sunshine are you kidding man hes terrible and so is heroes and villans and the rest GOD his high pitched notes are awful AND THIS GUYS A GENIUS? come on!Him and the beach boys were liked by the surf crowd but could never compare with the beatles , moody blues,wishbone ash, blue oyster cult and a million other bands so save your money even if your curious this is the worst performance ever and a lot of his music is copied the beach boys are washed up and brian is worse than that! HOW SAD!"
3,Be sure to measure,"It's a beautiful lamp, but I neglected to note how small it is. It's really not big enough to go on a side table where you will be reading. It's a nice accent light, tbough. Pretty pricey for the size. The company was cooperative in cancelling the 2nd one before they shipped it."
5,Excellent Pasta!,This is one of the best food products available. It's a healthy alternative to traditional pastas and has wonderful texture and most of all - tastes great!
1,Way too salty!,"I have been eating Nature's Path Original oatmeal for two years. It's become one of my standard breakfast foods. I especially love the fact that it does not have anything added, so I can add my own ingredients, like Vegan protein powder (to make ""protmeal"") or dried berries. Unfortunately, the last box I purchased is WAY TOO SALTY!! I don't like a lot of salt in the first place. It definitely does not mix well with the protein powder or dried berries. The packaging recently changed on this product and apparently so did the salt content, despite the fact the Ingredients stayed the same and the Nutrition Facts changed -- the Sodium count actually went down! Either Nature's Path needs to reduce the amount of salt or I will have to find another plain oatmeal to eat."
2,Has it's own agenda and it's not getting boys to read,"This book is not a book to get if you are trying to find books for your son to read. While the female counterpart has strong female characters that appeal to girls, this book does not feature strong male role models. Book after book had strong female characters, dealt with males having feelings more than adventures. I am not saying that is wrong for females to be strong or males to have feelings, but that is not the kind of book that my son gravitates toward. He wants action, adventure, fantasy -not ""girls are great"" and ""it's okay to cry"" mantras. The biography selection leans heavily on minority and female, often obscure, figures. This book is great if you are looking for books for both girls and boys that teach diversity and want to raise a sensitive male but it is lacking on ""boy"" appeal if you are looking for books for reluctant male readers."
2,Wait just a sec...,"Any of you true radiohead fans find this album unbearable, cliche of rock that you've been hearing for the past 5 years or so (which is why we love radiohead so much; they are so unique). However, you have to notice that Pablo Honey was released in 1993. Imagine a world of rock with Pearl Jam, Stone Temple Pilots, Nirvana, and then Radiohead's Pablo Honey. Things are in perspective now, aren't they? Although Pablo Honey is, in comparison to every other radiohead album, a true bore, it is at least worth acknowleging that it was way ahead of its time."
5,Radiohead's masterpiece! Creep Rules!,"Creep is by far the greatest song ever made. Get this CD because this song is on it, I don't care what the other ones sound like.If you like this CD e-mail me and tell me about it. (videogamer20@hotmail.com)Word out to the guys of Reign. Thanks for the e-mail."
4,Solid debut for an extraordinary band,"Before Radiohead managed to achieve their full potential as the extraordinary band that they are today, their debut ""Pablo Honey"" introduced the band to the whole world. ""Pablo Honey"" became a smash thanks to the radio smash ""Creep"" (a song that had since become a rock radio staple) that the band today claims nearly ruined them. ""Stop Whispering"", ""Anyone Can Play Guitar"", ""Vegetable"", and ""Lurgee"" are all hypnotic and emotional tracks that display Radiohead before they hit their stride. Vocalist Thom Yorke manages to offer a sense of hope in his lyrics behind all the gloom of the band's music, and while ""Pablo Honey"" is a more than solid debut album, it would only be a taste of things to come with subsequent releases like ""The Bends"" and the masterpiece that is ""OK Computer""."
1,Thank God they changed in 4 years.,"UGH, this is bad for any band. Why on Earth would you want to play post-grunge a few years after it died? ""Creep"" is just awful. One of the worst songs ever recorded. Radiohead said themself that they hated it. DOn't even bother downloading songs from this, people. It just..It's really bad, OK? Get The Bends for a good start."
3,A good album,"You can tell the band was just starting to get suff going on this album. I love the song Creep, but I can understand if other people aren't so sure about it. The song rocks and makes me want to sing along, but the rest of the songs are only okay. I can understand why Creep was so huge on the radio, and plus, great guitar work. The guitars are classic. But more a more accessible album, one should check out Kid A. Kid A is definitely the best Radiohead album in the history of rock."
4,Good book even if you've already been in the movie!,"I found this book to be a very useful companion/complement to Dr. Susan Love's ""Breast Book"". It shines in its coherent explanations of the statisitical end of medicine for us laypeople (and patients) who want to understand what our ""odds"" are and why. Goodson writes like how you wished your own doctors could-or would- talk to you."
3,not his best!,"of the 10 or so sam rivers cd's i have i rank this about 8th.Too brassy.""Contours"" with Dave Holland is probably his besalso ""Waves"" is very good."
2,not interested,since sheriff gastner departed the scene the entire series has lost its luster. while he was an old man shuffling from point a to b he was the glue that held it together. no more for me
2,Not a beginner's guide,"If you have little or no knowledge of wine, this is not the book for you. The author oscillates between the basic information and over-your-head wine snobbery. Start with something simpler and move to this book later."
4,"easy set-up, nice quality.","I have had this stuff for more than a year, never brings me any trouble. I basically slide the memory card in and turn it on, and it starts to show photos. Very smart product. The only down side is that the black frame is a bit too much."
3,An OK frame for the money,"This is an OK, average product. Very basic software, relatively easy to use and I like the fact that it allows a 1gig space on the SD card. The only problem that is very irritating is that you can not randomize the photos. It just loops them in the order they are on the card."
3,"Not Bad, Especially for the Price","I bought a couple of these frames last Christmas for our relatives. The pictures are presented on screen in sequence (no random option, unfortunately) and the color is acceptable. At times, some pictures are shown with a little too much yellow, but I don't know what conditions trigger that. However, as I said, the quality of the images is not bad and this was at the time among the least expensive frames.I think that this type of product requires one or two years to mature to a point where the quality is comparable to printed images, so i decided to go with a simple model for now."
3,Good product with limited features,"For a simple display of pictures, this product met my needs. I have not yet tried the music feature. The user-menu options are tedious and not user-friendly. In addition, you need the remote to make most of the changes, including basic features such as brightness, etc. So, if you lose the remote, you will not be able to access most features. Once settings are adjusted, the photos look nice. However, with just 2 features for ""Fill Screen"" and ""Fit photo"", either the picture gets chopped from the bottom or the picture gets crunched. Hence, the product is new technology with limited features - dont expect much other than a illuminated display of pictures which is a good talking point with guests, etc. I was disappointed that Amazon did not ask for the country of usage, and hence sent me the standard US power cord, although I planned to use the product in India - this meant I had to buy an additional transformer."
1,"Non-intuitive Interface, Not Mac Compatible","The interface on this product is poorly designed and is difficult to navigate. In order to make this work, I will have to load the pictures onto the SD card and be bound to display only those photos as it is not Mac compatible despite its claim to be. I would take it back if it weren't a gift. Maybe I'll sell it on eBay, but with the horrible reviews here, it doesn't look like it would sell."
3,great gift idea for military,"We bought this for my husband, to take with him when he deploys. Better than a regular picture frame, as it changes pictures and plays music!"
2,WORST I'VE SEEN,"I'VE BEEN TRYING TO FIND A PLAYER FOR SD CARDS RECORDED ON MY PANASONIC LUMIX CAMERA WHICH RECORDS BOTH STILLS AND VIDEO. I TRIED THE PHILIPS PORTABLE DVD PLAYER WITH IPOD DOCK WHICH WAS FINE EXCEPT IT WOULDN'T PLAY THE JPEG VIDEOS, I THEN TRIED THE WESTINGHOUSE DIGITAL FRAME WHICH HAD A BEAUTIFUL RESOLUTION AND PLAYED THE VIDEOS, BUT NO SOUND. THE KODAK FRAME SEEMED TO HAVE EVERYTHING I NEEDED, BUT THE REALITY WAS IT'S VERY POOR QUALITY. THE STILL PHOTOS WERE GRAINY AND THE BOTTOM WAS CUT OFF. AS FOR THE VIDEOS, THEY OCCASIONALLY PLAYED RIGHT, BUT MOSTLY ONLY THE SOUND PLAYED AND THE PICTURE WAS STILL, OR WORSE YET, BROKE UP. THE RESOLUTION WAS TERRIBLE AND, AS HAS BEEN STATED BEFORE, THE INSTRUCTIONS ARE MINIMAL. I WOULDN'T RECOMMEND THIS FRAME AT ALL."
4,good album!,"This is a cool cd! lots of older but very memorable songs on it, some I have heard before and forgotten about but am glad and was surprised to hear them again! I would recomend it for anyone who has heard and enjoyed any of his music, you will appreciate the rest as well!"
5,"Lost it, really missed it, bought it again","This is one of my favorite CDs, you know, the kind you always take on vacations where there's a rental car and long miles ahead. Sooner or later my favorite CDs all get lost, including ""Longing in Their Hearts."" So I just bought a replacement. My review is simple - if you like Bonnie Raitt and don't have this one yet, you're missing one of the all-time greats. And if you don't know Bonnie but love country with a little rock, a lot of rhythm, and no twang, well, like I said, you're missing one of the all-time greats."
5,MOST LIKELY HER BEST ALBUM EVER,"ONCE YOU HEAR ""STORM WARNING"", YOU HAVE GOT TO SAY IT IS ONE OF THE FINEST LOVE SONGS YOU WILL EVER HEAR."
2,Stikfas broke in half,"STIKFAS FEMALE BETA WARRIORI got this for my 11-year-old daughter, who loves it. After very little use, the joint used to attach the top half to the bottom broke, and cannot be fixed. I suspect that his might be a known defect in this toy. I would like a replacement or a refund. I usually avoid buying toys that fall apartt after three or four days' play.Lindsay Karabanow"
1,Boring Reading,"This book was boring reading. I expected much more from the author being a man. He really didn't expound on each subject which was only two or three pages. To be quite frank, because it didn't capture my attention, I did not finish reading it which is unimaginable because I love reading and always finish reading any new book in a couple of days, but not this one. I got more tips from a book written by Dr. Rosie Milligan."
3,This one disappointed me,"It may not disappoint you however. I liked the strong fusion of jazz, house, techno and latin found in the first three compilations. This one has more vocals, definitely underline the lounge here. I am an instrumentalist myself so I tend to favor the instrumentals with the cool beats that the first three releases featured."
5,The first book I loved!,"This is the first book that I ever loved. Who remembers anything from kindergarten? I'm almost 30 now and I remember checking a book out over and over again. I loved it so much, I think I wanted to steal it! I'm so glad that I found this book and I look forward to passing it on to my own children someday."
5,Wonderful book,"This is a long time children's book . It's a wonderful story that encourages a child's imagination !! My children loved it , my grandchildren loved it ., my greatgrandchildren love it !!"
4,It was ok,"I prefer Cole's ""immortal"" series though. This was good to pass the time. Amazon requires that I type more so I will say there are some steamy sex scenes and that the female lead in this book is whiny."
2,Not this time...,"I see that ""The Price of Pleasure"" has mostly high ratings, but I really didn't enjoy it. I usually enjoy Cole's older books, but not this time. I'm glad most everyone else did though =)"
4,Predictable,"I really like Kresley Coles work, this wasn't one of her best but having said that she is better than most."
5,Dramatic!!!,"If you like hyper-dramatic Spanish singers, this CD is for you. Raphael sets the standard for wretched musical excess. I love it! Thirty impassioned songs of passion, tears, and fiery lyrics. There's nothing subtle about Raphael. He belts them out like a bullfighter on speed.One song I wish was here is his version of ""Ave Maria' but there are plenty of other good ones -- ""Digan lo que Digan,"" ""Yo soy aquel,"" a so-so version of the great folk song ""Llorona,"" ""No me Puedo Quejar"" and a passionate rendition of one of the most flamboyant songs ever written: ""Malaguena."" Most of the upbeat songs on this CD are turkeys, but there's enough good, slow songs to give it a top rating.In English, Raphael would sound silly; in French he would sound pompous; in Spanish he sounds fabulous. Turn the volume up."
1,Good as long as it works,Used it for a year. Worked well. Charged it up for Memorial Day Camping weekend. Worked for 5 minutes. Died. Tried charging in car. Did the same thing. Battery dead. Warranty is for 1 year and not a fixable part according to the manufacturer. Not a very good GREEN product. Not a product for someone trying to be prepared. I'd pass on this.
1,Rechargable battery died and cannot be replaced,"The lantern worked great the first 5 or so times I used it. After that, the battery would no longer hold a charge and it is hard wired to the lantern so it cannot be replaced. Save your money and get a lantern that allows you to replace the batteries. I would not recommend this lantern to friends."
1,Battery not charging,I have had this lantern for about one year the battery went dead and will not charge.I have tried to find a battery but can not.
1,piece of junk,"This item has dreat features if it only worked. Mine began to malfunction in less than six months. In a little over a year, the battery quit accepting a charge. I threw the thing away and bought another brand."
1,this was a dud,"This product was returned quickly, the charger did not work, the switch did not work. I purchased a Coleman rechargeable, it was more expensive but it has been a great product."
1,an expensive piece of c**p,"Bought this for hurricane season...worked great right out of the box. The next season, nothing. I bought new bulbs...nothing. The green light stays on when charging lamp does nothing plugged in or not. Have to replace this one! Might as well use candles....at least they don disappoint"
1,Junk I owned two,They look nice but the first one lasted until the hurricane when I needed it most. Dead would not charge. I sent it back for warrenty replacement and they sent another brand new one. It last maybe a month. I would never buy another. If you have one good luck. Very fragile very iffy dont let this be your only light.
1,Not Worth the Money,I concur with the other reviews of this product. It's a disgrace to the Wenger Brand. The battery life is nonexistent. Don't waste your money; buy a Coleman.
4,A gentle breeze...,"This series is very good so far. A little expensive ($49.99 at release) for only 12 episodes however. Only fear I have of this series is that there is no real constant antagonist, a trait most Gonzo anime series' seem to share."
2,"Dont do it,","It Sucks. if I was to go back in time, the only reason I would buy this again would be if I had lost the will to live and wanted to watch awful awful Anima. Then only problem I have now is what do I do with this box set now"
3,better than expected,"i was never a big fan of Maxi Priest, so i was pleasantly surprised when one of my good friends told me to give it a listen.it reminded me alot of the late great Dennis Brown. so if your a fan of Dennis Brown, when he was into his smooth ballads groove you will surely be able to get into this cd."
5,MUST BUY !,"Excellent preparatory material for the Neurology Boards, put together by a distinguished panel of Neurology Chief Residents. Recommend to anybody interested in taking part-I of the Neurology Boards.If you are interested in Neurology Board review software, two softwares to consider are Neurology Boards 1.0 (for part-1 of the Neurology Boards) and Neurology Tutor 1.0 (for part-2 of the Neurology Boards). Both softwares are freely downloadable from www.peakdoctor.org"
5,TOTALLY Spellbinding.,Tanya Tucker as she sould be remembered. A great CD for any occasion because it has such a wide variety of great songs. My only complaint is I wish the album could be longer!
4,Just Enough For Me,"I preface this by pointing out that I'm not a MAJOR Tanya Tucker fan. But this CD has much of her very best material. The title is self-explanatory. My personal favorites are the bluesy ""Some Kind of Trouble"", & the ballads ""(Without You) What Do I Do With Me"" & ""Oh What It Did to Me"". The rest, of course, were also big radio hits, including ""It's a Little Too Late"", ""Down to My Last Teardrop"", ""Don't Go Out"", ""If Your Heart Ain't Busy Tonight"" & ""Two Sparrows in a Hurricane"". She's a fine vocalist with one of the most distinctive voices in music."
3,Fun for a while but then...,The first cable didn't work but Amazon rushed a replacement. The second cable works fine as long as the signal is going to my HDTV. If I turn the TV off or move to a different device the signal to my main monitor gets hinky. But if you need to occasionally hook your computer to a TV the pictures is really great.
5,Huey Lewis & The News - Plan B,"This is the album that we all knew they could make. Great music in the old ""bar band"" tradition. Super CD, every song is exceptional. The music is much less ""TOP 40"" production tunes than the older stuff. This is real good tunage! Get yours, today. Super album, just put it on and groove."
4,All you Enigma Lovers try Richard Myles...his music is incredible!,"http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Ddigital-music&field-keywords;=richard+myles&x;=0&y;=0Richard' music will suffice all of your gregorian, dance, ambient, erotic, and dark horror needs...listen to all 5 incredible albums!"
5,Hypnotic,"The rhythm and music from this album is absolutely hypnotic. It is excellent for meditation. I've purchased four copies since it's debut in 1991. It seems that every time I loan it to someone, I never get it back."
2,Gregorian CANT,"Sorry but there really are 2 kinds of people. People who think you can put a drumbeat to Gregorian Chant, and people who know that you can't. Try Enigma 3, the solo male vocal works much better."
2,Cognitive dissonance,"I was quite disappointed by this, and a bit worried by the almost uniformly-five star reviews here (which usually mean that something has gone terribly wrong). Essentially, 'Sadeness' is the standout, although the samples sound very naff nowadays. 'Principles of Lust' was also a moderate hit in the UK, but the rest of the album is basically ambient euro-pop filler, a bit like Jam & Spoon but much more pompous - all this stuff about how the album is a serious meditation on religion and sexuality seems divorced from reality. The supposedly-controversial religious angle is actually quite funny, and I get the impression that a lot of people take this much more seriously than it warrants. Unless you're fan, you'll find this extremely naff, and if you're a fan you'll probably grow out of it."
4,list of songs,It would help if I could have seen a list of songs on this particular CD. Enigma uses same graphics on it's cover & I could not tell if it was the particular CD I was looking for. It was not but that is ok - I like Enigma. But I am looking for a certain CD & have no way of telling which one is the right one just by the cover.
1,McDigital Pseudo Crap.,"(Let me start by saying I mean no offense to Enigma fans. This band was, after all, recommended to me by one of my best former friends.)Enigma is about as enigmatic (and substantial) as a cologne commercial. This album is Goth-tech, McProfound sh** from start to finish. A CD's worth of digi-beat danceteria mega-mix, all schtickily packaged in Gregorian chants, 'gothic' choral pieces, Casio-keyed New Age harmonic vibrations, and the like. In other words disco (Oh, I'm sorry--I mean Electronica!!) wrapped tight in layers of sampled, 'profound' sonic iconography. Enigma seemingly believes (or hopes) that this formula adds up to genuine 'substance'. (It is hard to describe Enigma's music, without a string of apostrophe encased adjectives--the band is psuedo itself.) Uhm, not quite. Image isn't artistry. MCMXC A.D. (OOh!! 1990 in ROMAN NUMERALS! Roman numerals like on cathedrals!! Gothic! Deep!!) isn't music it's marketing.Cheers,Robert"
2,not to impressed,This is really primitive. A German DJ recommended this artist to me so I went for the best of to start with and cant say Im gunna go much further than that. Its not bad but it really isnt bass music like Bass Mekanik or Beat Dominator. I think those guys have lifted the expectation beyond the originators of the bass music genre for me.
1,Not alone in the rip off!,"Glad to read the other review... I was right ticked off to have to pay for return of my order as well. Amazon misrepresents the product which appears to be an autobiography but is, in fact, sheet music. I would like a shipping refund, personally.(unable to rate zero stars on this one... but that would reflect the product vs the service!)"
3,30 yrs of B.B. review,"First let me say that when they are doing well, I love the Beach Boys. The first time I saw them live was the summer of approx. 2000. I was so totally satisfied and blown away! I heard that they sometimes do sub-par shows but this must have been one of the great ones. Allentown, PA fairgrounds. This set has many good cuts but I must say that in the effort to build a compilation set, they included a bunch of ( to me) space taking junk. If you are into trivia and deep details, you might get into it but if you are into the music, you'll have to pick and choose your way thru the set and maybe burn to CD the ones you really want."
1,Stereo is not dead,I just recently bought this and was very disappointed with the sound quality. Stereo became available in 1958 and was around when the Beach Boys cam out with Little Deuce Coupe. Little Deuce Coupe Album was available in Stereo or Mono. Why would anyone at Capital want to release box set with most of the songs in Mono when they were available in Stereo? Capital needs to fire someone. Now I am stuck with a poor sounding box set. Bad move on Capitals part. :(
1,"Don't waste your money - even at the ""sale"" price.","I saw a similar product at Verizon for my Moto Q, but thought I could get a better price online. Verizon price was $19 for a two-case package - one black and one silver. The single SF Planet version I ordered was BLACK, but it arrived in CLEAR, with a torn bottom edge. You could tell by the packaging alone that this product was inferior. The regular price is listed at $29.95, ""sale"" price is seven bucks with another six bucks for shipping... Trust me - a ripoff. You're better off with the better-quality cases from Verizon, or spend a few bucks more for leather, but avoid this one."
2,Riddled with Errors,"This book has the potential to be good but I've already uncovered about 20 mistakes during 2 weeks of extremely light use. There are numerous problems that are set up so that the answers are insane (Z > 9 problem 7-42). I think the publisher should fire whoever proofed this book. Don't waste your money, get Walpole and Myers instead for an introductory text."
1,Disappointed,"I know the description didn't say these socks were for a horse, yet they were too thin for a mans leg and would have fit up to my husbands hip, should he have tried to put them on!"
1,Do NOT buy these!,"In all fairness, maybe I got a bad set, but I will not be purchasing a second set. I kept getting these cuts on my fingers like paper cuts and couldn't figure out where they were coming from. Then one day, I noticed that one of my spoons had burs on the side of it where the metal was coming away from the spoon! In addition, some of my silver has developed these black striations in them.I was really disappointed because I recently lost everything I own and didn't want to have to replace things twice, if you know what I mean. I got these to replace the plastic silverware I had been using for the past 2 months! I had hoped that they would at least last a year, or so, but I can see I will have to be buying a new, more expensive set. Shame, because the shape and weight are beautiful.Lastly, these are made in China for those who are trying to avoid buying Chinese made products."
1,Wrong Item Sent!,"I have had this Hampton Forge silverware before and was excited to extend the set. However, when I ordered this set last year and got the package it was not Hampton Forge and the quality was horrific. I contacted Amazon, explained the problem and they reshipped the product...thinking it was just an error. NOPE! Same issue. I also sent that package back."
2,Nice to view,"a pretty good title however ""Pistols and Petticoats"" are in black and white. this tv show was originally filmed in color and broadcasted in color but the episodes in this dvd set are black and white. The video quality fair to good."
4,Nice Starter Book,"Even though this book is forty five years old, it makes for good reading about what used to be found in the areas that are listed.I have been to a number of these sites but many are now closed to collectors and some of them because of damage to company equipment at quarries.Some of the ""along the highway"" sites are still accessible and Fairystone State Park has enough material for collectors at the site that is listed. The store is now called ""Haynes 57"" as of a few years back and no digging tools are allowed. It is all hand picking only. The Cowee Valley of North Carolina still has some of the Ruby and Sapphire Mines open for bucket purchases but most are enriched with non-native minerals.There are more recent books available and they should be checked out to see if some of these sites are accessible."
1,The worst intro to linear algebra EVER.,"I was in one of the first classes Dr. Liebler decided to unleash this atrocity on. It was horrible then with 2 or 3 pages of errata, and it isn't much better now. Just imagine how horrible it was trying to learn the material with this as a textbook and with the author giving lectures that were just as foggy and incoherent. If I could give this book a 0 star rating, I would."
1,Do not buy this...... -Jult Warfell,"I had no high hopes for this series and true to my opinion, I was sadly dead on. Words cannot display how much time I invested watching this and its second half, not to mention the cabbage I wasted purchasing the two. -Jult Warfell"
1,Fell apart in under ten miles,"I bought these to see if I liked using trekking poles, and I'm glad I was only expecting a trial run. The handgrip fell off of one somewhere around mile 7 and the inner workings popped out when I then retracted it for easier carrying. Now to buy a real pair."
4,Great for the Price,"Looks like this is what I need for short hikes. A little on the heavy side, but good for day hikes."
1,Suggested Retail: $12.99,"I went to Swiss gear website to check out the pole and see if they had any others. This is the only pole they have which isn't saying much for the brand, but I found that the suggested retail is $4 lower to what Amazon is selling it for. Just seems like the seller should always be lower or at least the same price. Even though Amazon is jacking up the price its still really cheap. Probably too cheap to be any good."
3,Good sampler of the early beginnings of the techno scene,"Although these aren't up to the standard of the type of techno made popular in 1992 by such classics as James Brown Is Dead, Quadrophonia, Nocturne, Rave the Rhythm and other techno classics, this 1991 collection is a good, pretty pumping assortment of songs that were well on their way to being there, moving out of the experimental bleeps and blips and into a harder sound that would have the world raving a year l"
5,Excellent Legal Contracts,"I found this book most useful for the CD-ROM's legal contracts. As a consultant, I use these for all my clients.I have found my clients legal contracts to be biased entirely in their favor rather than this CD's contracts which tend to be fair and balanced, protecting both parties."
2,Think before you buy,I read the reviews like everyone else but thought...come on...this software must work decent otherwise major retailers wouldn't sell it. The day after I bought the software the audio in jack fuzzed out on me in the middle of a capture. The program froze several times in the 24 hours after purchase. Eveytime I closed the program...I was requested to send an error report. Product is being returned today. (pentium 4 2.0 ghz)
1,Horrible,"I purchased this product without reading the reviews. Upon reading the reviews I was hesitant to use the product but the store assured me that I could return it if I wasn't satisfied. After about 6 hours of downloads, installation, and trying to capture from analog when the only option the software would give me was digital, I attempted to copy my analog footage. It is horrible, horrible, horrible. Trust the previous reviews and do not purchase this product. I will be returning it tomorrow. The audio is completly off from the correct frames, our voices are distorted, and the picture stalls and jumps. I wish I hadn't wasted my time attempting to use this product."
4,"not that bad, really.","OK, as far as a capturing device I have not had any problems capturing at least 2 hours of analog video. Once I start editing the movie, I'll admit that the software is quirky and will shutdown and lock up the PC in rare instances. I've burned serveral DVDs with menu options, background music, special effects, etc. without a problem. The software requires patience and of course processor speed and adequate memory."
2,Problems,"Not sure if this is the spot for adding feedback to the Pinnacle software. If it is, I can only add my negative experiences with the software and support what little I was able to get. Would not buy the software or any hardware dependent on Pinnacle."
3,"102 Dalmations... Is It Good, Bad, Or Just Plain Weird?","102 Dalmations On DVD Shall I Say Is NOT The Greatest DVD To Buy, Although It Is Not The Worst. It's Worst Than The First But The DVD Features Make This One Worth A Look. The Quality Of The DVD's Picture Is B+. The Quality Of The DVD's Audio Is B. The Movie Rating Is A C. The Extras Get A C+. Although Here's My Recommendation For This Movie. If You Just Loved This Movie At Theatres, Then I'd Buy It. If You Thought It Was Ok, It May Be Worth A Rental. If You Didn't Really Care For It, Skip It. My Final Words Are: It Is Worth A Rental."
3,Lacks the Magic...,"There is nothing terribly wrong with this film, but it just seems a bit flat compared to the first one, not to mention the original animated version. If your kids just can't get enough of the first and you're dying to see something new, this is not a bad movie. But of the 3 ""Dalmatian"" movies (animated, 101, and 102), this comes in a distant third..."
2,Inaccurate size description,"The length stated in the product description is 1.0"", however it is only .5"" length and .5"" width. It is very small. But I need it for a Christmas gift, so I'll keep it."
5,"Nice pan, great delivery","This pan arrived in great condition. I used it for the first time tonight, for making risotto (which is notorious for sticking unless stirred furiously) . The pan was perfect, nothing stuck, and it was easy to clean. The lid also fits well. If I change my mind with further use I'll be sure to update this review!"
2,Buyer Beware!,"Having been a Joe Cocker fan in the late 60s and the 70s, I recently realized that I had no Joe on CD (only on vinyl). After picking up his greatest album ever (""Joe Cocker!"") on CD, I ordered ""The Best of Joe Cocker"" to bring me up to speed. One of the main reasons for getting this CD was that it contained the LIVE VERSION of ""Help from My Friends."" However, after receiving the CD and listening to the first few notes of ""My Friends,"" I realized that this was NOT the live version we all know and love. The classic live version of this song done at Woodstock (as well as the studio version on his 1st LP) makes the hair stand up on the back of your neck (the way the lead to ""Stairway to Heaven"" always does). This version is OK, but BUYER BEWARE - it is WAY less powerful than the Woodstock version. The rest of the album is OK, but all these songs are so overproduced compared those songs exhibiting the raw energy that his earlier work had. This was a disappointing buy."
1,Don't waste your time,This is simply a disjointed journal of a series of short hikes with portions deteriorating to a lame account of car camping. This ranks as one of the worst books ever published. Don't waste your time.
4,AWESOME LOOK,"Great appearance with tower speakers, performance is a great. sub has plenty of a theatre in a box. Did have a little technical difficulty a couple times but seems to be working fine now. It would go to all static and i would have to shut it off adn turn it back on. Very strange but no problems in a month or so. love the sounds!!!"
4,Wacom Graphire Tablet - GREAT but miss the old holder,"This is a fantastic pen mouse. It works just as well as any other Wacom tablet that I've had. I really like the way the pen can be stored away when you're on the go. BUT, I do miss the way the old tablet I had had a built-in upright holder for the pen and that holder didn't move around and about. This new one's plastic holder isn't actually attached to the tablet, so whenever I go to lift the pen out of it, or put the pen in it, the holder moves around, which is a bit of an annoyance."
5,Hear it to believe it!,"I never really though i needed this until i bought it and heard the difference!Meeeeeeeeeeen, what a difference in depth!It totally makes your sound better.. there must be a fairy trapped in every unit of these wonderful products."
2,Not as good as I expected!,We connected the straps to our boat fenders and unfortunately the radgiting strap broke on our first day on the water. The plastic construction is not strong enough to hold the weight of the fender.
2,"very early techno, but a few stand out tracks,","Considering it's subtitled ""back to basics"", this volume lives up to its name. It's actually earlier sounding techno than X-static volume one. The songs are very simplistic and not at all hardcore or pumping, although there are a couple of tracks that clearly pushed the hardcore envelope and stand out as must have techno songs. So, if you are interested in having a compilation to demonstrate the progression towards hardcore techno, this is it, otherwise, look for later volumes to get that real techno sound."
5,Genius with a heart,"Some may criticise Stoppard for being 'all brains with no heart', but with Arcadia he has proved his critics wrong. This is an extraordinary play, for not only does it deal expertly with scientific issues, but it manages to be brilliantly funny and poignant. The final scene in particular with Septimus and Thomasina is undeniably tragic (I won't give away any more than that!)and thought-provoking, yet at no point does the play fall victim to over-sentimentality. Almost as good to read as it is to perform, Arcadia is without doubt Stoppard's masterpiece - which says a great deal considering the strength of many of his other works. In short, Arcadia is a play of fascinating ideas, combined with all the ingredients of great entertainment."
5,Perfect for my wife!,"Hello!I recently bought this basket for my wife and she loves it. Simply fold the tabs up slightly, fit over the bars and fold the tabs back down. I used a small zip tie down low to secure the basket to the handlebar column and make everything fit nice and snug but this is not necessary.Now I am considering buying another for my daughter. Great product."
2,Needs more tension,"The strip was long enough, easy to mount and went up quickly. Unfortunately the strip and the rolling ""pins"" inside which provides the tension did not provide adequate ""grip"" for my maps. On rare occasion when we walk by the maps and lightly brush against them the maps either slowly disengage and fall to the floor or quickly disengage and fall to the floor.I was highly disappointed but I've tried to ""fix"" it by adding more paper behind the maps to add thickness in hopes of a better hold. Shall see how that goes."
3,Easy read,A light hearted historic love story. If only love was that way now what a wonderful world this would be
2,Lovejoy thinks that computer networks are magic,"First the good news: The story is not altogether bad. Lovejoy does a very good job with his characterizations, I really connected with most of them. The the bad news: Technically speaking this novel is more wrong than right. Lovejoy has us telnetting to email addresses, refers to the world wide web as a different network and in many cases leaves me with the impression that he thinks that computers are magic. If Lovejoy would have allowed a network engineer to read the book before it was published many if his small mistakes could have been fixed, but in addition to those, his major premise is also flawed. In short this book is like then old B movies. If you have a real working knowlodge of computers of the Internet, you'll need to leave that _reality_ at the door."
2,Inaccurate and slow,"I'm sorry, but this book was a real disappointment. Lovejoy's reasearch into the subject of the internet was pretty superficial; the book contained loads of technical inaccuracies. Although the preface of the book stated that many details of the internet were concealed or changed in order to prevent computer crime, he should have at least preserved _some_ credibility. (The part where a character downloads a multi-gigabyte file over a 9600 baud modem an a few hours was one of my favorites) Aside from the inaccuracies, most of the characters in the book weren't very likable, and the hero of the novel bears an uncomfortable resemblence to the Unabomber. Finally, the author never really explains the motivations behind the villain's actions, and those that are revealed don't really fit in with the crimes which s/he committed. I really wouldn't recommend this one."
4,But it wasn't the minister...,Correction to a previous review. The minister was not the character in question mentioned below. It was the boss at the lumber yard.I think all of Robby Benson's movies are great. I wish he would do more.
1,Ole To Billie Joe,"It took long to be receive. For the amount you pay you expect at least good quality. Movie was burned, not the original, no picture cover, no name title, and movie vision was very poor. It's not what i expected. Very disappointed."
4,Cancelled????,"Amazon first listed this DVD for a release date of Feb. 10, then April 28, NOW they have completely removed it all together, no explanations! After searching many other websites I have found that the release of this long awaited DVD has been cancelled! What's up with that!?If you, too, are disappointed with this decision, write to Warner Bros. Home Video and voice your complaint, as did I."
2,The main problem with this book is the overall attitude,"When we are talking about the fate of the German people during WWII and its aftermath, one should keep in mind that despite all the deaths and suffering, it was rather a case of absolutely incredible luck than a tragedy: Germans waged and lost ""the war of annihilation"" and so many of them managed to survive.However, this problem does not diminish the significance of this topic in all its aspects."
3,True stories from survivors,"Survivor stories - including my own - reveal the true history of the ethnic cleansing of Germans during WWII.It's important to keep the memories of the survivors.A Pebble in My Shoe by Flotz, Katherine Hoeger published by Pannonia Press Paperback"
2,heart rate monitor,This is a VERY difficult monitor to understand and use for all of it's programs. The booklet is terrible therefore you have to call the 1-800 hoping to understand how to use it. I would NOT recommend this model
4,"Works well, great price...","Yes, it's a bit complicated to program full workouts with multiple lap intervals. However, the basic functionality works well, is simple and it's half the price of similar products, so it's tough to beat."
5,For all Brintney Fans!,"This single is great and I reccomend it for every Britney fan. Here's my review on the tracks.1.Opps....I did It again Album version-great track with (with Titanic voices) 2.Rodney Jerkins Remix-Very simmalir to what she sang at the MTV 2000 video awards(No Titanic voices) 3.Ospina's Crossover Mix-A very R&B version of Opps....(No Titanic voices)4.Riprock'N' Alex G. Opps we remixed it again(Radio Mix)-A very spacey version of Opps... sounds like somethnig she would sing at the begining of her concert(no Titanic voices.) 5.Ospina's Deep Club Mix-A club version of the original remix of the crossover mix(no Titanic voices) 6.Riprock'N' Alex G.Opps we remixed it again(Club Mix)-Another Club mix to the original Radio Mix version(no Titanic vocies) 7.Ospina's Insturmental Dub Mix-An Insturmentel version of the Deep Club Mix(no Titanic vocies) A wicked cd, I highly reccomend this to all Britney Fans!"
3,Nice Story but Thin on Romance,Please refer to the other review for information about the plot. When I read a romance I like to read some romantic passages before the ending. We get some dancing and not much else. I also like at least one kiss before the ending which we don't get either. I do like this author's other works. This is not usually a problem with this author.
4,Peanut Butter Goodness,"Not bad. Crunchy. Good peanut taste. I agree with the other reviewer - not enough peanut butter taste for the really strong PB cravers, but enough to keep mouths happy. Good for a filling and satifying snack."
1,way too sweet !,"I have tried many granola bars, and from the good reviews I thought I would give these a go.. However they are way too sweet! They are loaded with tapioca syrup, invert cane syrup, evaporated cane juice and molasses.( I have a feeling there is even sugar in the peanut butter they are using ) Don't be fooled by these ""natural sugars"" If you are looking for a desert I would buy them. For my taste they are just too sweet for a granola bar."
4,Good granola bars for quick energy,"These are tasty organic granola bars that are good to take along for a snack while hiking, cycling, camping, etc. The subscribe and save price makes them comparable in price to less healthy alternatives you can get in the grocery store."
4,Excellent data,"This is an excellent source for the evidenced-based data you need to understand why a doula is such an amazing investment. A different scope than The Birth Partner, this is very helpful for knowing how and why to help laboring women as well as their partners. Appendix provides direction and simple instructions for furthering knowledge. I recommend it to all birth partners or anyone seeking evidence-based education on childbirth."
1,Not Very Informative,"My mother was recently diagnosed, and I bought this book hoping it would be an informative summary of treatment methods, statistics, and coping strategies. Unfortunately, it is not. It contains pretty much the same general information that can be found on the American Cancer Society web site, and I would recommend the National Cancer Institute's PDQ service for much more comprehensive clinical information. Also, my mother's oncologist provided several pamphlets that were just as good or better on treatment side effects and coping strategies. As far as I can tell, this book's main merit is its case studies, all of which have positive outcomes. These may give patients more hope. However, the price of the book is a little steep if that's all one gets from it. I would recommend that patients and families do their own research: it's more empowering, it's free, and the information is better."
5,mirror blue cd,I was very happy with the CD. The case was broken but the music was good and that is the most important part for me.
3,A paler Thompson,"The celtic ballads, the humorous up tempo numbers all strike classic Thompson poses, but all relate to stronger work found on other releases. For the new Thompson collector I would go to Shoot Out the Lights, Pour Down Like Silver and Rumour and Sigh for highpoints and different points of view to his work. For Thompson fans this is a logical addition, but I find it a bit cold and it doesn't hit my laser too often.."
3,strat book,"the book was ok I am a frustrated guitar player who can't play well so I want to be a strat expert,lot of tech stuff not real glamorous but informative"
2,LCD Screen Failure,I also have one of these laptops and have had the same overheat issue. I managed to get the dust out without opening the case....but what really disappoints me with this machine is the failing screen. Eight vertical lines so far permanently on the screen whenever it's powered up and a new one seems to appear weekly.My machine is two years old. Will I ever buy another Toshiba? Nope.
5,THE VERY BEST OF THE A*TEENS,POP TIL YOU DROP IS THE A*TEENS BEST CD SO FAR ITS FULL OF GREAT SONGS WITH CATCHY TUNES MY PERSONAL FAVORITE IS LET YOUR HEART DO ALL THE TALKING ITS SUCH A CATCHY COOL SONG I HAVE PROBABLY LISTENED TO IT 100 TIMES I AM CRAZY ABOUT IT. ACTUALLY TO BE HONEST I LOVE THE WHOLE CD. OTHER GREAT SONGS ARE FLOOR FILLER ITS A REALLY HOT DANCE SONG I ALSO LOVE SCHOOLS OUT ITS A AWSOME SONG ONE YOU WILL WANT TO LISTEN TO A DOZEN TIMES CLOSER TO PERFECTION ALSO ROCKS I THINK I WILL JUST BRING IT DOWN TO THIS THE CD IS A MUST HAVE FOR ANYONE WHO LOVES POP MUSIC OR DANCE MUSIC.
4,"great album, but not as good as TEEN SPIRIT","the first a-teens-album THE ABBA GENERATION was a great album, TEEN SPIRIT was a masterpiece- so i was very excited about POP TIL YOU DROP. altogether its a great album but not as good as the last. some songs are real burners: FLOORFILLER is very catchy- a perfect party-song CLOSER TO PERFECTION is the best song they ever had- a real 80ies-song sounding a bit like a mixture of kim wilde and kylie 15 years ago, CROSS MY HEART has a great tune and is very original. i also like HI AND GOODBYE. but there also some titles which seems to be a bit boring to me- OH, OH YEAH and SINGLED OUT for example. and LET YOUR HEART DO...is awful, a total loss.but the good songs outweigh and so i think POP TIL YOU DROP is worth buying it. it's not avaible in germany now but i hope that will change soon..."
4,Very Good CD!,"While its not their best, it's worth it to buy. My favorite song on it is, Floorfiller."
5,Real Tools for Busy Managers,"McGuffin and Alexopoulos small resource is a tremendous value for healthcare managers interested in action, not just talk. The text focuses on three discrete areas ( human resources and leadership; finance and productivity; and policy. The extensive appendix contains numerous tools and checklists, which can be modified to specific agency or accreditation requirements.Although the book is designed for working managers, the concise format would be appreciated by students. Instead of a single text, faculty and students could utilize recent articles from business, healthcare, organizational behavior, and other disciplines as a source for theory. The internet contains an abundance of material that could be incorporated into class discussions, or serve as a means of obtaining case studies.An added benefit of the guide is that it will be used, rather than ""remain on the shelf"" after the nursing student graduates."
3,Good brief information on historical figures. I agree with,"the above contributor...this author covered leaders of major religions except Jesus Christ. The oversight seems intentional since he covered the others. I'd like to see him revise the book to include Jesus and a few other historical figures. If you are looking for indept information, this is not your book. If you are looking for a quick overview with main facts, this may be the book for you."
3,"Not bad for an EDTV, but it's not HDTV.","First of all, this TV is an EDTV 'monitor', not an HDTV as they want you to think. I received mine today, and the actual spec is buried on p.16 of the manual. This TV is only capable of displaying 480p max, and can receive HDTV signals that are passed through an external decoder (the decoder is not built in). However those 780p/1080i HDTV signals are downconverted to 480p. Same with Progressive-scan DVDs. I wish I would have known this before ordering. Now, the picture looks nice, but $3k is a lot to spend on a widescreen TV, even though it's a flat-panel."
3,are u an idiot,"to the person with troubles, i doubt the troubles are with the t.v. if it happens to be defective, send it back. duh.to the student, no one cares, boo hoo. It's 200 and 3! you've never seen a $3000.00 t.v.?"
5,Wow! The rest of the album's good too!!!,"The first time I brought this album, I was only into the song ""I'm Too Sexy"". I was a young (17 Maybe), cocky kid who thought the song perfectly fit me. Out of sheer boredom one day, I decided to play the rest of the album while playing video games. I was absolutely intrigued by some of the big-band sounds in ""Deeply Dippy"", lulled into a peaceful state by the music behind ""Swan"", and just absolutely FELL IN LOVE with ""Those Simple Things"". The ENTIRE album is incredible. It's such an eclectic mix of sounds, that one can't help but enjoy the entire thing. Everyone that I know that's heard ""I'm Too Sexy"" just thinks that the song is silly, but I'm telling you, the album just has to be heard to be believed!!! I don't care what anyone else says about this album, this is one album that I'M NOT ASHAMED TO SAY THAT I LIKE AND I WILL DEFEND THIS ALBUM TO ANYONE WHO DOESN'T THINK THIS GROUP CAN PUT OUT A GOOD SONG OTHER THAN ""I'M TOO SEXY""!!!!!"
5,one of my remedies treating depression,"The radio wakes me up in the morning, and listinging to FM radio, I have breakfast and do make-up. The DJ introduced the song, I am too sexy, with the related episode. She enjoyed to sway to the music in her convertible. That sounded so cool. The next thing is that I bought this CD, and jumped into the car and raised the volume. When I feel depressed, I sing this song raising the volume, then I AM Too-sexy."
3,Eh,"This was more about the anatomy of the human head and not so much how to draw it. For someone learning the art of portraits, yes it helps to understand muscle and bone structures, but I would have rather it discuss drawing as well."
1,one long ad for Nike and Brand Jordan,"There is no one in sports that I love more than MJ, being a Bulls fan since the 1960s. I still love Michael, but this book was a supreme disappointment. By and large, it is an all too detailed history of the design and sales success of his shoes and newer clothing line, peppered with Michael's passages about being determined and ""driven"", which all ring true, but have been stated many times before and in better form. If you really want to learn about MJ, I would suggest Playing for Keeps by David Halberstam or The Golden Boys by Cameron Stauth, which profiles the members of the 1992 Olympic Dream Team. The profiles on MJ and the other team members are probably the best I have read on elite professional athletes. If you want some great photos and a book written by MJ, Rare Air is much better than this one."
1,Unintelligible.,"It doesn't matter if you're a genius or not if you can't communicate with everyone else. Rick Altman needs to go back to school and learn how to write. To be be fair though the man does raise interesting and important points on Genre Theory, but again such knowledge is useless if it cannot be discerned from the large amounts of fluff he has in this book as filler. He never gets to the point and the points he does have can be summarized very easily."
3,Attack of the sythesized strings...,"I bought this in hopes of enjoying it just as much the Side Show recording. However, I'm disappointed in 'Duets'. It seems to me that this CD sounded dated even before it was released. Much of the music is over accompanied (notably the strangely long and horrid intro to 'In His Eyes') and the instrumentals are bad enough to distract even my untrained ears.Many of the songs are Broadway standards, but I would like to have seen them arranged in a way that makes us remember why we liked them to begin with.The hidden stuff (at the end of track 15) is very enjoyable and shows off the comic timing both women get to display in their second album 'Unsuspecting Hearts' (which, although better, still suffers from poor arrangements and orchestrations).An ok CD...but it will probably end up on the shelf where you keep your 60's and 70's Streisand recordings."
3,Nice,Chips are beautiful but it doesn't seem like it's made to wear everday. The band seems like it has streched and can break at any moment. It's still going strong but it feels like I need to wear with care.
4,Very good motherboard to 64-bit systems.,"This is a very good motherboard at the time (2003) and still usable with 2GB of DDR memory. Only downturn it required Registered memory which is usually available as ECC, which has a price premium and it's hard to find. Be sure to match pairs of same model and microchips so it can run on dual-channel."
5,Very good indeed!,"I'm a huge Pet Shop Boys fan. ""Very"" is my favorite album of their's. While the early to mid-'90s were drowning in grunge music, PSB puts out a brilliant yet underrated synth-pop album that will remain a personal favorite among loyal listeners. Neil and Chris' cover of the Village People's ""Go West"" is far superior version. I own the original orange case for ""Very"" which I cannot bear to part with but when I found out about the reissues w/remixes and outtakes I had to buy the newly reissued ""Very"". I must say that the reissue cd is awesome. I love the the previously unreleased 12 inch remix of ""Go West"". I've heard other remixes of the song but this remix is so much better. I am so glad that I now have the duo's tribute to the same titled comedy show ""Absolutely Fabulous"" on cd. I always did like that song but it was only available on cd as an import. Overall excellent album with even more excellent remixes and outtakes. Definitely well worth the money."
5,Excellent book,A great book. She covers 16 doctrines of the Catholic Faith. She explains them in clear terms and provides excellent analagoies for how to explain them to your children. It is great for parents and non parents who simple want an easy to understand explanation of their faith.
4,PRACTICAL HEALING MANUAL,"This book shows you in a clear step-by-step way how to awaken and give expression to the (Ch'i) healing energy, and demonstrates effective ways to balance one's own energies and direct healing to others. These healing techniques are based on 4 simple concepts: * that we are composed of energy on many levels, linking the physical body to the spiritual self * disease stems from imbalances in this energy and can be corrected by right action * when 2 or more living things come together, subtle eneregy is exchanged between them * there are sources of energy outside ourselves that can be drawn upon to improve our health, vitality and well-being. The book draws upon the wisdom of Chinese belief as well as many other traditions. There are helpful illustrations throughout, a list of organisations providing training courses in healing, a glossary of terms, extensive bibliography and index."
1,"Doesn't work, zero tech support","I purchased this by download from Ulead's site. The program wouldn't recognize my Cd burner (Roxio Easy CD worked fine, but didn't do what I wanted to do with photos). I emailed tech support and got a response a week later saying that they didn't have an answer and needed more time. That's been about 3 weeks ago and I never got a response. Look and see how many people complain about the program not working on Ulead's message board before you buy this. I should have tried the trial version first, but I checked and the site said it supported my drive, OS, etc."
3,Much of the story is trite and cliched but (see details) I still enjoyed it.,Much of the story is trite and cliched but doggone if the pretty (and good) actors and the verve and style of the film don't just make me not care about that. I enjoyed it.
3,Marco is the best,"Nobody has a better voice than Marco Antonio Solis...he is encredable!!! She might be good, but nobody but nobody,,,IS BETTER THAN MARCO...LISTEN TO HIM SING AND YOU WILL AGREE!!!! HE IS NOT ONLY TALENTED BUT HIS VOICE IS WONDERFUL!"
5,Was super pleased!,"Was extremely pleased with the books!! The books were brand new, never used and in new packaging. So far from reading the series I have been so pleased and the story is amazing. I would definitely recommend this book series and seller to someone else."
5,Well worth the read!,"Robert Jordan, may he rest in peace, wrote a great series in the Wheels of Time. These first three books in the series tell a great story and unfold nicely. I enjoyed reading them, and highly recommend them to anyone that likes this genre of books!"
1,And people said it would be so good...,"If you have to write a book with a great deal of religious content, you have to write from more than one side.. or you loose readers. This one made me sick after the first few chapters. You need a light side as well as a dark side."
5,Let the Dragon Ride Again on the Winds of Time-R.J.,"This is not your basic Swords and Magic adventure story. The characters, lands and events become so real that they take on a life of their own. Each novel is bigger, better, and more complex than the last. If there is one series you read in your life, this should be the one."
5,Best Ever,"This series is most likely the best written series I have ever read. And believe me I have read a lot of fantasy series and know a good book when I see one. Before I read the wheel of time I probably never would have read a book close to a thousand pages long and now I have read ten. The amazing thing about Jordan is that he can keep your attention no matter how boring it gets. His books are a veritable weaving of plots and sub-plots, the best I have ever seen, except for the Lord of the Rings. Some people say that his later works aren't as good as the other ones and were only written to make money. Personaly I don't think so or care, I hope he never quits writting. Or at least, as he said, untill they nail his coffin shut."
4,bloody america,"BloodlandThis book is very interesting for someone who is into the action genre. The books main character is Key Lessard a Vietnam veteran who is now a mercenary who came home and found his hometown infiltrated by neo-Nazi. The neo-nazi are part of a group that calls themselves the T.F.L. (the truth, the faith the lord). Key gets a strange feeling when he hears the word ""weird"" a lot and when his old football coach, that tells him about the T.F.L, suddenly dies, key calls his old buddy in the CIA, Key was now on the government payroll. Key goes undercover in till the T.F.L. learns about him working for the government. The T.F.L. tries to kill Key and Key gets mad. Key gets a gun and fights the T.F.L. single-handedly. Key finally takes back his town but he's not done with the war!"
2,Disappointing,"I had the Columbia LP version of this when I was in my teens. I remember it as being much better than this, more exciting, and despite (or because of) the 1938 sound, more atmospheric. To hear the original Goodman band at its best, get ""Benny Goodman on the Air (1937-1938)"", Columbia 48836. All the excitement and atmosphere of the live performances comes through the very old sound, crowd noises and all."
5,Excellent book of children's drawings,"This is an adorable book written by Jeff Kunkel filled with the drawings of children and their interpretation of Jesus and life. I may be a little biased; I am the Robin Miller featured on page 33. Fourteen years later, I still look back as this book being a wonderful gift for young children to understand the life of Jesus as told via kids their own age."

5,An excellent resource,Races of Ebberon is an excellent resource for the Dungeons & Dragons Ebberon campaign setting. It gives players more backround information on the various races and power groups to take role-playing to a new level. This book also introduces new feats and spells to take your character in new directions.
5,"The Sky, My Friend","It is hard to claim for a PJ Harvey album as her best, because every album of hers is such a classic! Is This Desire includes some of her most melancholic and darkest songs yet such as the classics ""The River"", ""Angelene"" and ""Catherine"". I believe this album carries her ""To Bring You My Love"" album one step forward.Because her vocals are much more clear and comfortable. Melodies of songs are more experimental. However, they really catch the listener easily. Even the darkest ""Electric Light"", ""Catherine"" and ""My Beatuiful Leah"" can be your personal favorite from the very first listening. Try this album if you want to hear from one of the most talented female musicians of the last two decades."
3,Let this one grow on you,"If you're new to PJ Harvey, don't buy this one first. Get Give you My Love, and Stories From the City. Is This Desire takes time to get in, under and over. For me, the little danceable details didn't really grab me until a year into listening to it consistently. The voice permutations I find distracting, and make some songs unlistenable for me.This is not an easy, enjoyable CD, it's cathartic. Definately worthwhile having in a collection, (the Sky Lit Up, Electric Light, The Garden, and title track, Is this Desire are particularly good) but get aquainted with her other stuff first I'd suggest."
5,Much Better Than TBYML!,"I first borrowed this from a friend and I must say that songs like The Garden, The Wind, Catherine, Joy, Electric Light, Angelene, My Beautiful Leah make this record a must have. Catherine is one of the most touching, brilliant tracks of all time. It ""tears my heart out, every time"". Another magical moment is when that haunting organ cuts in on The Garden. This CD is a must have!"
4,Classic PJ Harvey,"I think what compells me to PJ Harvey's music is the fact that she writes with such brutally honest, if not poetic lyrics. Ever since acquiring ""Stories From the City..."" I have rediscovered an artist I so long ago discarded in the early '90s. Today I revere PJ Harvey's music and her as an artist. She is a rarity in the music industry I think. I can hear her changing as an artist through her albums. ""Is This Desire?"" is just one step towards the maturity she reaches with her current album ""Stories From the City...""."
4,Nice Picture,"Cons: 1. Unfortunalty I am going to have to exchange this product for a new one, due to several ""blank"" pixels on the left side of the frame after the frame has been on for a few hours.2. I was very disappointed in the instructions for using the frame. There is pretty much no instructions as to how to put your pictures on it, you need to know how to navigate your own computer once you have plugged in your frame. The software that comes with the frame has nothing to due with uploading pictures to it, which was a bit confusing.Pros: 1. You can download songs to the frame that will play during a slideshow, plays videos, and the picture looks great!2. You can upload pictures into different files and change the groups of pictures that change.3. The frame gives you a lot of control for your own preferences. I love that you can have it automatically turn on and off at a certain time to save energy. The remote control is great!4. Lots of options for veiwing! Great picture!"
2,Bad reviews about SV811 are all true,"I don't really want to repeat great reviews I've found for SV811 digital frame, especially the discussions about video playback at the frame. Siply put, Kodak falsely advertise that the frame can play video - it can't. EasyShare software badly designed and very inconvinient to use. You'll need extensive work with every picture in order to display it properly.My advise - if you need to buy it as a present for old people (who won't try most of the listed options), it's OK.Don't buy it for yourself."
2,terrible KODAK frame,The frame was from kodak and normaly there products are good. This product was defective and I tried to e-mail kodak two times but none called me. The frame is still defective and I need more help from kodak to resolve this product. The frame was for my wife's mothers day but she's not happy to see her grandchildren pictures.
2,"Okay, But Depends on What You Need","I have no complaints about the frame's ease of use or picture quality, but the inability to randomly portray the pictures is a MAJOR drawback to me, and is a big disappointment. Had I known I would NOT have purchased this. What good is being able to put 2GB worth of pictures in the frame if EVERY TIME you turn it on you are faced with the same pictures in the same order? If you want to see picture #700 you might just want to leave it on all night and catch it when you get up.I also learned there is no need for the included Easy Share software. Just connect the frame via USB and transfer the photos."
1,WiFi Capable? -- Not with Kodak!!,"You can't even use the wifi features of this frame when Kodak deletes all of your pictures. If you can't use the Kodak Gallery (only on-line service supported), then you might as well save some money, and buy another frame that uses portable storage. Very, very, very disappointed. I responded to every warning from Kodak with a reminder that I was using the gallery with my frame. THEY DELETED MY PICTURES ANYWAY!!!"
2,"Pretty, but lame",Graphics. Okay.Buttons and remote...okayPeripheral capability....looks good but sucksSoftware/firmware.....crappyUser manual.......crappyWhat Kodak should have provided was a software program that could be used to easily crop and size your photos to fit the 800x480 size.The frame did not even acknowledge when I plugged in a KODAK compactflash! What pooty-doo!Look around and compare before you buy this.
1,Not great!,"This digital photo frame is ok, but not great!The frame stand is MUCH, MUCH too short and forces the frame to lie back at a very low angle. Also, the Voice quality of my videos when displayed on this frame sounds like Mickey Mouse is talking!!Picture quality is ok."
1,Ultimate Teacher - Ulimate Looser,"I implore you, do not waste your time on this piece of garbage, it isn't even worth buying for the video tape it's on. The plot is horrid, it makes very little sense, and the voice acting is worse. It tries to be funny but tries far too hard, and just comes across as [bad]. There are two cool moments in the whole movie which maybe total two minutes, one of these is a five second or so breast shot, which you can get much better, and longer in many other anime of better quality. I rented it ... and wish I had my money back."
5,My Favorite Christmas Album,Truly this is my Favorite Christmas Album. I bought a cassette years ago and I wore it out. I was glad to purchase it this Christmas and I will enjoy it throughtout the year. My Family enjoy this CD also and they have purchase it to.
1,Older version - beware!,I was expecting the lastest version - it was version 2.0 not 3.0 and it will cost to upgrade - find another supplier who will give you the lastest - shame on you Amazon!
4,"Shun Elite 4.5"" cooks knife","Great Knife on the blade end - the handle is to small for me. After having the opportunity to handle the Shun Elite, Classic,Premier, and Ken Onion. I find the classic D handle the most comfortable to use. Stick with the classic line."
4,"Lots of fun but can't replace ""exclusive"" frisbee catching dog","I bought this set for my friend's daughter's birthday. She is 8 and loves the set. My 8 y/o daughter also loves all her Littlest Pep Shop toys and we have never had a complaint with anything. But her daughter apparently broke the head off of the dog that comes with this set and the dog, which is supposed to catch a frisbee, is sold exclusively with the set. I would like to help her get it replaced but since I misplaced the receipt I think they are stuck.Still - these toys have been great fun for the girls and it isn't a complaint about the quality of the toys."
2,thorough but boring account,"a very tedious, exhaustive treatise of african colonialism, politics, war, and oh, did i mention, the search for the giant sable antelope. having had interest in this magnificent, but rare species, i had picked the book up at the local library hoping it would divulge its secrets and whereabouts. instead, over 80% of the book deals with the aforementioned topics and the author tries hard to interlace this history with the sable, unsuccessfully i might add. there is so much detail and tedium that if i wanted a historical book i would have bought one. he goes on to great lenghts the describe written and biographical accounts of explorers and hunters that i could barely keep my heavy lids open to continue reading. bottom line: best left for the armchair historian rather than naturalist."
2,Surprisingly Dull,"When I saw the list of actors in this movie, I assumed wrongly that it would be more than just a few action scenes held together with a rather dull, uninteresting plot, and bland acting. As a previous reviewer mentioned, why were several very good actors in this movie given the lack of substance with no real chance for good acting? Carano is beautiful, good at what she does obviously, but she is not an actress; you would have thought she would be included to spice it up a bit but not the main show. Once again I was left disappointed as I have been with so many new releases in recent years. They throw some good actors into a movie with a weak plot simply to make a dollar."
1,Does Not Live Up To Its Hype,"Men's Fitness magazine lauded this movie and I was excited to see it. Almost from the start, it was slow, herky-jerky, and boring. It is very rare for me to fall asleep during a movie, but I cannot remember the ending to this one as I dipped in and out of snoozeville."
4,One Fighting Female Flick!,"'Haywire' is a fairly well made, female fighter flick! We need more of those. Furthermore, young teens can watch this film without polluting their minds with overt sexuality, bloody gore, and wincingly raunchy expletives every fives seconds. Seriously, it's got more going for it than against as long as you're not looking for an Academy Award winning picture. It's fun, thrilling, has great fight scenes that are fairly realistic and isn't so convoluted that you lose sight of the plot.I say give it a go for a great R&R; with family or friends on a Saturday afternoon or evening. Solid 3 1/2 Stars!"
2,Painfully bad,"I really like and admire Gina Carrano, and I hate to pan this movie, but the directing and screenplay were both just so painfully bad that honesty compels me to do so. Gina Carrano tried her best, and she gives an entirely credible performance, especially considering her background is that of an MMA cage fighter, not an actress. But Steven Soderbergh was a very poor choice of a director for an action film. The Sitcom is his forte, and he apparently has no understanding of any other genre.The story is the same trite, cliche nonsense we have all seen 100 times before, ""secret agent set up and betrayed by her own agency, and now she's on the run and looking for revenge"".The military uses the term ""blivet"" to mean 20 pounds of steer manure stuffed into a ten-pound bag, and that's a good description of this movie."
1,Do not waste your time watching,"The screenplay is very poor, fights are also poorly choreographed. Really you would not find reasons to watch this.Do not get attracted by reputable actors, they are not playing any major roles."
1,Everyone needs to pay the rent,"Stupefied! Now that all the actors have paid the rent hopefully they can make better action flicks next time. This movie sucked sour grapes. The acting was bad. The plot I'm still trying to grasp. A Bourne movie it is not. The characters are forgettable. The action is sub-par. And if you can keep up with present day and the flash backs, kudos to you. I'm still trying to figure out why the people she worked for even felt the need to set her up. Just an all around confusing mash-up of movie styles and acting that did not work well. Not worth the rental price and certainly not worth the price a theater would charge."
1,I should've listened to the reviews!,"I was going to rent this movie online through Amazon but the reviews mainly stated the movie was horrible. So I decided to save a couple bucks and rented it through Redbox. Geez, I should've listened to the reviews and not rented it period!I forced myself to watch at least half of the movie before turning it off. The few fight scenes I viewed are so slow, it literally looks as if the actors are saying ""ok now you hit me""...""ok now I kick you"". The music during the fight scenes make it even more boring. The only thing I can get out of this movie is that Gina is beautiful...but I could google pics of her for free."
2,"Good fight scenes, no plot",The fight scenes were pretty good... And that's about the best thing I can say about the movie. Carano does ok in her first film. She has potential but I don't think the filmmaker actual gave her much of a chance.
1,slow,"the action was slow, the ""stunts"" were subpar, half the movie was watching someone run, two thumbs down!!! gina doesn't belong on a movie screen! just don't tell her i said that..."
4,Haywire,I liked this movie .I was intrerested in the movie through out the complete film.I am glad I bought this movie.
3,I like it,"Specially Gina, but yes ....it could have been a better movie probably more interaction between main characters, and a different final perhaps mor graphic on Banderas and the other loose ends."
2,Will Make a good MST3K flick,"Crappy plot. Horrible acting.I can't say that I had high hopes for this flick, but man...Alan Smithee wouldn't put his name on this crap.I was excited when I saw the all-star cast, but the excitement ended there. If I had to choose a highlight it would be the uber realistic fight scenes. Gina C. definitely made up for some horrid acting with some kick ass ass kicking.If you're like me you'll probably watch this regardless of the bad review, but trust me...your time will be better spent planking."
2,Something happened in Barcelona...,"There are spoilers...That's the theme of the movie, something happened in Barcelona. No one seems to know what happened but everyone wants to know. I'll tell you what happened in Barcelona, she didn't like loose ends. Which of course means she'll chase someone for about 15 minutes through the streets of Spain, after being shot at by said person, all so she can hit him a few times and leave him alive. In the end she tells her team mates who ask, 'where'd you go?', that she doesn't like loose ends... Cause when I think of tieing up loose ends, I'm talking about punching someone a couple times then walking away after they took me on a 15 minute chase... Fail.So much more but I won't ruin the rest in case someone wants to watch it for an action flick. If it was intended to be a cheesey comedy with a little action, then it was...acceptable... But a rock your sox off action flick of epic proportions...no."
2,LOST BUT NICE RACK,"Lost in the beginning, lost in the middle, figured it out in the end, But what saves the movie is the pretty women with the nice rack! lol"
2,Diamond in a Cheap Tin Setting,"You might expect that the problem would be the non-actor, non-star, non-Hollywood Gina Carano. After all, the rest of the project is packed with veteran actors and a genius director.You would be wrong. Carano is a credible actress with charisma, sex appeal, and unusual beauty. Plus, she kicks ass. She is the only reason to watch this terrible movie.The plot is shopworn, the dialog trite, the direction lifeless. Even Irish and Spanish locales seem to be chosen randomly. A couple of fight scenes are okay though not inventive.Only Gina Carano is worth seeing. Let's hope this is not her only feature, and that next time she gets a proper showcase."
1,Bad B movie,This is almost as pathetic as striptease. Awful acting. Awful everything. Even the 'martial arts' are galatically bad and poorly choreographed. Rent an episode of sesame street instead.
3,was okay,Storyline wasn't very clear and fight scenes were a bit slow as were the chase scenes on foot and in car Gina carano did good for her first movie but as an mma star I expected a little more she trains in muy thai and the choreographer did not show that side of her... overall I thought the movie was okay
2,sueshu,"This movie was a real disappointment. There were so many terrific actors in it that it should have been better. Unfortunately, the primary character, was not one of those actors. The plot was underdeveloped, the main character unlikeable, and it seemed to go on forever."
2,so-so with very long running scenes,"The fight scenes were realistic, but short compared to the time they spent filming her run after bad guys or the really long time she spent getting away from the police in the first chase with little to no action.The movie should of been titled ""The Running Girl"".The music was awful as well, presumably in an effort to make up for the lack of dialogue and the main characters extremely bad acting skills.With the number of ""A"" list actors in the cast, the movie should of been a lot better, but they appeared to sleep walk through the thing."
1,boring,"Unfortunately i was super excited to go see this movie in theaters, and was super disappointed. they used the music from ocean's 11 to mission impossible action. and it was silent during some fight scenes. good parts completely given away in trailers. the actors were fine, some of my favorites to this day, i would even like to see the break-thru-female lead in more action films, but the direction of this film was a snore. the story could have been told much better. you could have added another hour of filming to the story and cut out the parts that you snooze through. just very disappointing all around."
1,waste of time,"SOOOO glad I waited till it was down to $.99. Guess all the money went to the cameo actors, Douglas, Paxton, McGregor, Banderas.You would think Steven Soderbergh with hits as Oceans 11,12,&13, Erin Brockovich, & Traffic under his belt this would be a good movie... fahgettaboudit"
1,Don't Waste your Money,"Anyone who thinks this movie is worth watching do not have anything better to do! I'm going to ask Amazon for my money back! Haywire is so Borring, I didn't know if I was watching an Action Movie or what! Its bad acting period. Especially from a cast of such! This movie is just BAD & I'm putting it next to ""Never Watch Again"" Pile..."
1,haywire or headache,"I had high hopes for this movie, maybe thats how i set myself up, i was thinking this would be along the lines of ""the bourne identity"" , but all the flash backs grew a little too tiring. Sure i can handle a few, but through out the entire movie? Sure the fight scenes were great, and i think they banked too much on that. I found myself thinking okay she's in trouble but its a flash back, so that kinda destroyed the film for me along with the phrase "" get to the point "", with a great cast this was a bust of a movie which was sad. If you got money to burn or want to just build your collection, then buy this, but buyer beware."
1,Boring and Bad,"This movie revealed to me how difficult it must be to make a good action thriller. Sure, Gina's acting is awful, even painful, but that wasn't the worst part. The movie spends long stretches of time exploring boring, tedious moments set to ridiculous, comically bad smooth jazz. You keep waiting for a reason to care, and it never comes. Watch the four action scenes on Youtube instead."
3,THAT GIRL IS CRAZY SMART,"This was an interesting movie. Being set up then finding out it was the people you worked for isn't new, but how she handled it was. Lots of excitment and chase scene with the usual narrow escape."
3,Watchable I guess,"It's an action flick, so the plot is thin. Unfortunately, even the action was stretched out. Like a fairly long running scene in an open alley. The actual fighting scenes are great after all Gina is a MMA fighter. With the director and other cast I was just hoping for a bit more."
3,Good Action Movie,"First off this is not an academy award type movie, it's weak in acting although that may be due to the script. Either way this was a good action movie. The fight scene's were entertaining and the plot was an easy one to follow. If you wanna just chill out and enjoy some action with minimal blood and gore this is a great one for you. Enjoy!"
3,Interesting!,"Great story behind the book's subject...picture print quality is just ""ok"". Not sure I would recommend this book at this price point."
2,Another Delay??,"Wow..EA has done it again! I first went to the store on August 12, all excited to get Madden 2005 and play it that night. But then they told me it comes out September 9, which was annoying enough. Now I look it up again on amazon, and it now says the 14th!? Will this game ever come out? This should be filed with the FCC as deceptive advertising, since all the ads show the PC/CDROM logo, and say August 12th."
3,c'mon already,"Bill Parcells has already coached the Cowboys for a year already so how come they don't have his name in it, and you should've said something about ur release date too, EA."
2,I Don't Get It,"I was confused in the first couple of chapters, then the convoluted story about Wellington and Jazzmyne, the typos, and that ridiculous stuff at the end about finding your soulmate - I was not impressed with this story at all. Morrison seemed to be more concerned with the moments of intimacy, which were quite graphic to me. There is nothing new here, just the same old mumbo jumbo that everybody and their mother seems to be publishing these days. Maybe I'll read the follow-up books to see where this goes and if they get any better"
3,Can you say DRAMA?,"In Morrison's, Soulmates Dissipate, you believe just as Jada does that she is about to live happily ever after with Wellington. We all soon find out that happily ever after is a long ways away.Wellington is loving, romantic and a cheat, but he doesn't act alone. Enter Melanie, a family friend who has just come down for the annual family barbeque. What she leaves with is more than Jada bargained.Soulmates Dissipates, is packed with family secrets, a little ménage a trois, motherly deceit, and serious life altering changes. Will Jada and Weollington marry? Will she ever forgive him?I have to admit that the beginning of this novel was pretty choppy. The events were all over the place, but once the BIG drama hits, its smooth sailing from there on. If you are in the mood for some serious drama, I recommend you pick up this book. I suggest you get the sequel, Never Again Once More, because this book leaves you wanting more.JackiR.E.A.L. Reviewers"
5,Must Read!!!,"I have to admit, I read this one in 1 day!!!, it's a page turner. Please go and get it!!!!"
3,An ok read,"I wouldn't say this was the worst book I have ever read, but it did lack something. The characters were too materialistic and that took away from the point of the story.... oh, I forgot there wasn't a point.Jada messed her own love life by letting another woman have a piece of what she cherished most. From that point on the relationship went down hill and so did the story."
3,interesting yet confusing,was it me or was this a book that you found yourself turning back the page to reread to figure out what the hell was going on. Confused
3,Better Than Maiden Bride...,"This book was better than Maiden Bride; I liked the hero better and there was no annoying revenge plot. There were, however, several problems with this story.One is inconsistencies. For example, at one point Aisley is pondering why Piers always keeps himself and the castle shrouded in darkness. She supposes that he could be disfigured by losing a limb in battle. Aisley is thinking this (and here's my beef)AFTER Piers has already WALKED across the room to grasp her with BOTH hands. How could someone who had lost a limb accomplish this??! And then there's the darkness issue. How could the castle have been kept SO dark that Aisley can't see Piers, yet she can share meals with him and move about without any great difficulty? I find this hard to swallow.Still, despite these quibbles, The Devil's Lady is an enjoyable, romantic love story, and could be worth reading if you have a few hours to kill."
4,glorious!,"Before receiving this book I wasn't sure that I wanted to include Moscow in my trip to Russia, but now I have seen all of the glories it has to offer, I am hooked!"
3,decent,"the maps weren't very helpful, and it was definitely not aimed at students with low budgets. nice pictures and good metro stations to visit, along with other good suggestions about interesting places to visit makes it worthwhile, but get a better map if possible."
4,Great guide and source of background information,"I travelled to Moscow in November 2002 and found this guide to be of great assistance in planning what I wanted to see, getting background information and in follow-up reading and reference after I returned. One use after I returned was in matching my photos to the pictures in the guide to label them and this worked extremely well. The pictures are beautiful, and the background information is extensive and helpful in understanding what you are going to see.The one drawback is that the 1998 publication date makes this book not very useful in information on new hotels, restaurants or prices.Compare guidebooks and I think you will see that this one is by far the best for detail, pictures and general information.Highly recommended."
4,Wonderful,"If you sat through ""Life With Lions"" or any of the early John & Yoko stuff--even if you heard the first Fireman album and didn't like it--don't let that ruin a chance to hear this superb CD.Because, unlike the others--This is Music.McCartney has waited until late in life to explore all those musical avenues everyone said were open to him. Some of it (the Liverpool Oratio, for instance) has been fantastic, others (Standing Stone) not quite so good. But who would have thought, when he was issuing singles like ""Girls School,"" that he would ever be able to stretch himself so strongly?Rushes is a great, great recrod. Though you won't find yourself singing along or humming it on the way to work, you will find yourself lost in it, wondering where the time went."
5,This Paul McC?????????????????????????????????????????,"Are the other reviewers messing with my head? Is this an acid flashback?No matter who was involved in the making of this album, it has to be one of the loveliest journeys through muzik-real (just made that up, 'cos I can't think of any other appropriate term at present). When a CD can be so varied and warped and hang together so well, there has to be genius involved somewhere.A CD to sit down and get to know properly - played it about three times the day I bought it and still play it often when I feel like having a really alternative headspace. Listen to track one on headphones for a semi-hallucinatory audial experience (have seasick pills on hand though).Hats off to you Sir Paul, if this isn't an acid flashback that is. Never thought a McC CD would make my desert island collection!"
2,Doesn't sound like McCartney,"Listened to the rushes of ""Rushes"" and to be honest, was a bit disappointed. If it is actually McCartney I will buy the album and have a full listen - but its a little too different from what I expected on first listen."
2,tasteless,"well, do you know how difficult it is to find WHITE RICE PUFFED RICE?Only company that does it is QUAKER.Millet doesn't cut it. sorry. won't but it again.Have tried all the puffed rice products. Most don't tell you that these puffed rice products are BROWN RICE PUFFED RICE.. Truth in advertising?I think not.BROWN RICE PUFFED just doesn't have the taste of WHITE RICE PUFFED.I can still find it at ALBERTSONS at around $4 bucks a box."
1,Very disappointed,"We knew this product was used, but was under the impression that it would arrive in ""gently used"" condition. It was missing most of the pull-out letter inserts and even worse, half a page was torn and missing as well. Would never purchase from this company again."
1,wow.,"I can't begin to express how atrocious this text is. I guarantee that as soon as you begin to read the first chapter, your brain will either:a) Turn into an amorphous blobb) Explodej) Flat out vanishc) Burst into flamesd) There are no alternatives! (readers of the text will understand this)Unless you believe that the only way to thoroughly examine a topic is to come up with illogical arguments that are supported by almost entirely out dated or (frankly) nonsensical material, run far far away.You may think I'm exaggerating but I couldn't be more serious.This book, however, does supply you with endless laughter (one star awarded).Think of it almost as a satire on reason and you'll be entertained for days."
2,So disappointing : (,"I am a big fan of the Miss Julia books and was so excited to read her latest adventure. Unfortunately, I found this book to have a very weak plot. She finds out that her marriage may not be legal. So? Just go down to city hall and get married again. End of story. Why drag this story out for 300 odd pages? I read up to page 133 and finally gave up. Too many other books out there to better spend my time."
4,Good Buy,Product was great. Very pleased with quality and price. It did take longer to receive than I expected-about 2 weeks.
1,JUST TERRIBLE!!!!!,"I have read all of the Miss Julia books and have loved them and I have truly fallen in love with Miss Julie; however this book was the pits, it was dismal, dumb and stupid. Miss Julia and Sam do not know if they are legally married as they are suppose to be so instead of just getting re-married Miss Julia sends Sam off on a wild goose chase and this book has nothing to do with a ""school of beauty"" but a beauty pageant. Paleeze, this is one of if not the worst books I have ever read and I have over a thousand books in my house and have read many more from the library. Do not waste your money on this installment."
4,"Good, but not great, movie","This film featured the great Mitzi Gaynor, and was also the film debut of future Mouseketeer Sharon Baird. Their dancing is superb. While not an A-list musical, it is a very entertaining film overall."
3,bloodhounds of broadway,though not one of the all time greats it is a welcome addition to my collection fo Hollywood Musicals
2,"Dumb, cliched story-Predicible plot","Okay, first of all, Nick was Jessica's true love, but now he's disappeared?? She never even phoned him and he's the one who got her into the whole thing about becoming a cop/bodyguard/investgator. Instead, she's dating a movie star?? Jessica, who loves the limelight turns down the chance to STAR in a major play?? It doesn't fit. The ending of this story is totally predictable. I hate that the summer books are so unrelated to the rest of the series--why not just write them as a separate edition instead of fitting them in the regular, numbered SVU books? The whole New York story would have been better off on its own."
1,THIS ALBUM IS NOT GOOD,"Reel Big Fish I have one question. Why in the heck did they let put out a record that is so bad. Why Do They Rock So Hard? is horrible. It isn't ska. It isn't punk/ska. It is a rock n' roll album with some ska beats every once in a while. Not a ska album with some rock beats like before. Reel Big Fish used to be my favorite band. I was so looking forward to this album but now that I've heard it I am very disappointed. They are playing music they think will sell, not what they like. Think about that. Why did they do this? They are starting to sound like Chicago, but Chicago was good at what they did. Just like RBF was good at ska. Guess they don't play that anymore. I think you the guys should start asking hemselves what happened to their music. Ask them how much money they think they are gonna make. They just lost 13 bucks because I'm bringing this back."
3,"The ""Reel"" deal?","This is a good disc, and I can see why they're popular, but it's not what I think of when I think of ska. It's not so much ska-punk, as it is ska-pop. It has alot more in common with ""No Doubt"" and ""Smash Mouth"", than it does with the older hardcore ska bands. At best it reminds me of ""The Mighty Mighty Bosstones"" or ""Fishbone"". But I do want to say it's good, and catchy, just a bit happier than what I was hoping for. Maybe I'm getting old."
4,""" I though that t was their best yet ""","it is better than ""Keep your receipt"" or ""turn the radio off"" because there was a lot more alternative in it."
4,"Overall, the best music from RBF so far.","100 times better than Turn the Radio Off, which was incredible. A must by for anyone who is into good ole' American Ska-Core"
5,"Wow, do these guys rock","Not only does Reel big Fish make kick ass records like this, they also do it with a sense of humor that every musician should adopt. even when they sing about getting screwed over, its funny. Hearing them live is much better and mor intense that the album. One truly deserving and talented band. I would have given 100000 stars if it was offered"
1,REEL BIG FISH SUCK!,"I think this is the worst album they ever made, this is worse than Goldfinger(and that is pretty bad)! Reel Big Fish needs to start putting some good songs out like they use to!"
1,All About Dreams,"Okay, but readers of this book should balance the content against other compelling perspectives, e.g., DREAMS by KALLMYER is an excellent book which provides a scholarly, yet practical view that is sure to challenge the reader."
5,A really excellent book,I think the book was really great and I enjoy the book it.Keep up the good book
2,disappointing,"If you became a fan of Steve Miller from his hits in the 70s, then I advise you to just buy the greatest hits disc and steer clear of this set. Having listened to true bluesmen (Muddy Waters, Leadbelly, John Lee Hooker, etc) sing real blues, it is painful to listen to Miller attempt it. He is good on the guitar but he just hasn't got the voice to carry off a good blues vocal."
5,Steve Miller Band Box Set,"I think that this is an excellent box set by the Steve Miller Band,if your a fan of the band from the beginning like I am, you'll want to have this in your collection I think that if covers all of the bands hits over the years very well,this is definately worth having I like this box set alot."
5,Who wants a peice of Microsoft History?,"Just having this card in my machine get's rid of the bad Juju and promotes healthy microsoft edicate. I hope Microsoft makes a note book and workstation since there hardware is what works with microsoft software. Thanks again. Hope to see more microsoft in my machine. You know what? I don't even care if something comes out with a faster connection. I would not sell my card right now, and I don't think it would be fare to look at anything faster, I would probably mess up my brain. Besides, I don't remeber asking for anything faster when I first had a computer, and when the speed addicts find my machine again I know it will get stolen. But there's always the Microsoft lawsuits that come after that. I hope this set's everything straight."
2,Largely Forgettable,I was so disappointed in this book. The charactors are too perfect and have no depth whatsoever. There are no weaknesses to overcome for the good guys and the plot isn't challanging to the reader. It is predictable and promotes every plot/stereotype imaginable. I love post-apocalyptic books that use imagination and honest adult spit fire. This trite piece of work fizzles!
5,DREAM ON ALONE IS WORTH THE PRICE,"Awesome album from America's greatest band! These guys just won't stop churning out awesome albums!If you got the money,buy this,if not,don't eat for a few days until you do.One of the bands best!"
5,best cd ever,i was very happy with the cd of aerosmith a little south of sanity. the music is wonderful. the only thing better than the cd is a live performance with the band in front of me with steven tyler shaking his but and the band rockin
5,Aerosmith Rocks!!!!!!!!,"Aerosmith is the best band of all time! They could rip it up in the 70's, 80's, and can still do it now. They have some of the best guitar riffs, and this album shows it so well. Steven Tyler is awesome(even if he is ancient). Again this album is awesome, SO BUY IT!"
3,Aerosmith Bangin' Heads LIVE!,This is another one of them live cds where the track list is killer but the live version just does not compare to the studio recorded version! I must admit that Steve's voice on this cd is very strong! I though that with his age & all that he has been through it might be a little harder to hit some of them notes in some of them song but he belted them songs out like he was 15-20 younger than he really is! & the guitar playing on this album is just Awesome! I meen who can play guitar better than Joe Perry! I do recomend this cd to everyone! Only reason i only give it 3 stars is because i myself don't care for live recordings!
2,Theres A Hole In my Soul,"Thers's A Hole! In My Soul! and its coming from this album! Its missing the true enegery from their shows!Saw Them in ''94 in Japan and Costa Rica there they gave better shows than they do here in Atlanta better said than in the U.S. ""Pump""was the last good U.S. tour. Maybe some drugs and alcachol after they start their show will be a good thing for the fans. It may also help their music!"
3,If you can buy the LP version,"This is a great live album, if you can buy it in the vinyl version and download the mp3 do it. CD quality is not the best,"
3,"Good, but needs a little more of his old voice...","Great compilation, especially, the second disk. Classics were almost as good as the original bootleg versoins in early 80. Would of loved the disk better if Steve still could sing with his old full range... A CD to buy if you want some great songs together."
5,Great for warnings!,"I bought this hammer and oh man! did I ever use it to hammer. This hammer is ideal for hammering out a warning, especially in the morning. If you are the type of person who enjoys hammering out a warning I highly recommend purchasing this hammer. Currently, I am planning a road trip in which I intend on hammering all across the land. Details to come."
5,Calling all squash junkies!,"When I asked the squash pro at my club if he'd read Zug's book, he turned up his nose. He found much of the material self-indulgent. As for me - a person who took up the sport at a time when many others my age have retired their rackets - I admired the quality of Zug's writing and the way he unraveled the story of the game's evolution. I dug those historical tidbits (did you know the Titanic had a squash court?) and the tales of some of the sport's more eccentric players. Yeah, sure, there were some parts of SQUASH which ""hit the nick and died"" for me, but no big deal. I'd recommend this book to anyone who has been bitten by the SQUASH bug."
3,North Am Squash,The title of the book is misleading - it is purely about North American squash history.I was expecting write ups on recognized international greats and found nothing.
1,"Short-lived relief, then headaches","I've tried Claritin several times for seasonal allergy - runny nose, itchy eyes, sneezing. Each time it did bring some relief the first day, but by the second day it was already losing its effect, the by third day it had no effect at all. And each time I stopped taking it, I got a terrible headache that lasted most of a day and wasn't relieved by aspirin. A clear-cut case of the cure being worse than the disease"
3,"Avoid, unless you have established success with it.","It will help control allergies, but sinus sufferers looking to decongest-dry out must seek the Claritin-D formulation instead.This is effective, but pricey. Generics are almost equal, but a word about generics: they use the basic drug formula, but are free to use any delivery additives they wish. Those additives do change how it reacts in your body, for some people. I would recommend Claritin and not a knockoff for precisely that reason.Fred"
5,"A moving, fiery tale","Pagan Dances Of Caherbarnagh is a splendidly written novel revealing the soul of Ireland and the breath of America. Written with resounding emotion, author Bridget O'Mahony's covers the heart-wrenching loss of leaving one's country, family, and identity for a glittering future hope in a far-off land. A moving, fiery tale of drive, determination, and the uplifting vigor of the spirit, Bridget O'Mahony's is highly recommended reading from first page to last!."
4,"Good, but not as good as their first album","First of all, I am a huge rap and hip hop fan. I own albums from just about every rapper out there. Orishas first album ""A lo Cubano"" is one of my favorite rap albums of all time. ""Emigrante"" is a good encore for them but they clearly miss Flaco-Pro who in my opinion was by far their best flower and rhyme spitter. Apparently he had a falling out with the rest of them. He is the reason that their first album was so good. Without him, it seems that they got away from rap and went into more hip hop which is fine. Emigrante is good, but Orishas badly misses Flaco-Pro."
1,ugh,"I just watched this film and thank goodness I purchased it from the thrift store. I don't understand all the good reviews on here. Yes it ties in the real meaning of Christmas, and that is a refreshing change, but the singing is AWFUL throughout. The heroine has a cane that she obviously doesn't need. Just because it mentions Jesus doesn't make it a wonderful film. I LIKE that it mentions Jesus, but it's so difficult to listen to the singing and to watch the heroine, Sophiana, run with her cane never limping. It was awful. UGH."
1,This should not be rated G!,"We normally only let our 3.5 year old daughter watch programs that are rated G, so we felt this would be appropriate for her. She just watched this movie and cried because she was so scared. There were definitely some scary parts not suitable for the under 5 crowd. I feel this should be rated PG."
5,Christmas is here again,"One of a very few Christmas movies that explains to kids what is the reason for Christmas, Chirstmas is for the birth of Jesus"
1,What is it?!,"If you are looking for a pleasurable protein drink, this one is not it. This mix is very bitter. I took 1 swallow, nearly had to spit it out. I tried to add splenda to it, same thing gross! I cannot even get a refund because it is food, non-refundable. I was very disappointed. Save your money!"
3,It's Okay - Nothing New,"It's an okay documentary. Nothing spectular, nothing new was presented. I have seen better documentaries. For the fan of Princess Diana, it is a good addition."
1,I was had,"So I dropped the stylus from my smaller Wacom Usb pad in my foot bath. It ceased working. That's the breaks. Instead of getting just the new pen I decided to get the bigger pad, pen included. So after a three week wait by the supplier, it came. As a graphics pad it works. I looked at the pretty pictures on the box. O ho Thought I, a way to play around with an Ink like software without buying a TabletPc. Well The software doesn't install. It says uninstall previous software. I did, again and again. So I googled around to find a fix which (...) convinced me it wasn't just because I was a bad girl. So I have the big pad. And oops I didnt try it with my Photoshop before writing this. My previous stylus had its bad hair days with the pressure sensitive effect. Didjaknow that Al Hirschfeld used the big pad to do his great cartoons? So my review is like the little girl with the curl in the middle of her forhead, when it s good it is very very good, and when it is bad it is horrid."
1,Big Disappointment,The flavor was wonderful but i just couldn't get past the gritty texture. These are going in the trash.
2,Does not ship well and other brand tastes better.,"While the cookies have a good taste for a gluten free product, they were mostly broken into small pieces within the box. Amazon does not accept returns for grocery items, so I would definitely recommend the Orgran animal cookies in chocolate and vanilla. They are very good and thicker than the Envirokids. My daughter prefers the taste of the Orgran brand over the Envirokids. I have never had a problem with the Orgran brand breaking during transit.OrgraN Outback Animals, Vanilla Cookies, 6.2-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 8)"
4,Grotesqueries Review,"This is a very nice collection of alternative ""spooky"" pieces to watch.I was looking for something that was family-friendly and not normallyseen by people. The seller was prompt in sending the DVD and it arrivedin perfect condition. :)"
4,What the ancients thought about gender is important- buy it.,This is your chance to replace rumor and speculation with fact. How may times have you over-heard some Blow Hard go on and on at a cocktail party about how masculinity was expressed and thought of in Classical Times and wondered just how much of a blow hard he might REALLY be? Buy this good book to find out (The hard back is simply but beautifully bound too.)
3,Not what I expected,"While interesting...I was expecting more of a focus on better parenting, while this was part of the story, a bigger focus seemed to be the mother coming to terms with herself and her past. This wasn't what I expected."
4,Good,"This product really works really well, i have cats that im allergic to but it really helps me be around the, more."
5,Don't discount the early stuff,"Had the Beatles stopped here and not gone on to do anything else, they still would have been one of the most powerful, influential, and great forces in rock history. Singles like ""She Loves You"" are simply brilliant. All of these performances are inventive, confident, and exciting."
4,"Past Masters 1 does its job, and makes a good album also","This album gathers together all the singles in the early beatles catolauge not available on cd and makes a cd out of it, for the diehard beatles fan, the german songs are a nice treat. Captures the essence of Beatles pop songs."
5,A retrosepective Beatles missing time capsule here!,"These collections of missing never before beatles british U.K. singles that they did not appear on all their albums.But probably essential and diverse recordings of their studio days chronicling every odd track hits. Like songs from ""She Loves You"" both sung in German and English with same as ""I Want To Hold Your Hand"". And also a song that is great called ""I Feel Fine"". Most of these favorites are excellent right here for Beatlemania fans!"
4,Get it for about half an album's worth of good stuff,"You'll probably already have 'Love Me Do', 'She Loves You' and 'I Want To Hold Your Hand', and you might not give a stale bratwurst whether you have the German versions thereof. But do check this album out, especially from track 10 onwards. Highlights are a magnificent 'Long Tall Sally' with Paul McCartney's searing vocals making Little Richard seem positively tame, and a red-blooded 'Bad Boy' snarled by John Lennon. 'Slow Down' and 'Matchbox' contribute well in this section which sees the Beatles paying tribute to their rock n' roll roots. I also like 'Yes It Is', a song in the vein of 'This Boy' but maybe even better."
3,Worth renting,"This movie really has me scared to go to the Grand Canyon!!! Not that I'm planning to go under quite the same circumstances as the hapless couple in the movie, but still, I am actually planning to go there! Hope I don't run into any wolves!"
2,depressing,"This flick reminded me of Open Water.2 honeymooners decide to take a trail ride in the Grand Canyon.It has a very depressing survival theme.The quality of the movie is excellent.The acting is superb and I like that they use real animals (not fake CGI).However, the plot goes south during the movie and you don't have a good feeling when it is done."
4,"Amazon damaged delivery, again!!!!!","My book came damaged!!!Book was dented. More care should be taken in delivering and packaging these heavy expensive book. Amazon used to pack these book better, now they just throw these heavy items in a box.This is the second time a book came damaged. Very disappointed with your handling of these expensive books and I have spoken to several friends who have had the same problem. Will think twice in ordering from Amazon in the future and I'm sure many others think the same."
1,What a waste,"Peter Beard. A beautiful book and marvelous potential wasted. It's been a while since I've flipped through something so obviously self-indulgent and pretentious. Documenting the obliteration of the wildlife of Africa he glibly scrawls phone numbers and random words such as cellophane over images that left me, frankly, chilled to the bone. Was that Mr. Beards intent? I hardly think so. Instead I was left with the impression that he was, well, trying to impress his detachment.If I had a kabillion dollars to my name and grew up feeling nothing (do I really need to break that one down?) I would probably sing the praises of this book, as it is..."
1,"good nail polish, not so good music","i bought this based on listening to a sampling of her singing chris isaac's 'wicked game.' i always love when a woman covers a man's song, or vice versa. however, this album was a huge disappointment. lippmann's voice is really nothing to write home about. i highly recommend her nail polish line, lippmann collection, though. some of my favourite colors are made by that brand."
2,Not good for Pet Fountains....,"Bought this product when I bought our Drinkwell 360 fountain for our cats. Had intended to use it in the reusable filter we also bought, to save money on the filter replacements. It came in a HUGE container, like a life-time supply! LOL! That would have been fine, except that it doesn't work at all well for our application. It is so full of fine dust, even after repeated rinsings, that it clogs the screen at both ends of the filter almost immediately. It almost burned out our fountain motor. Back to the refills for us. I'm sure this is adequate charcoal for other applications, just don't use it in anything with fine screening."
3,unit fried and no customer support,"Bought the unit 25 months ago at a good price and have been satisfied with the sound quality. Just one month after the warranty expired the unit began smoking and fried. Luckily I was home before a fire started, but the power swith didn't cut it off, had to pull the plug. E-Mailed the manufacturer to see if there was a known defect in the amp or if there was a recall but have gotten no response. As I said, unit was cheap for the sound it put out, but is it worth burning down your house?"
5,Cuisin-art,"If you take the Beatles, Kinks, Cheap Trick, Queen, the Beach Boys, the Who, the Byrds and the Move and throw them in a huge blender you'll have, besides a bloody mess, Jellyfish's Spilt Milk. Which is not to say this is a bad thing...Jellyfish take all these random and diverse influences and create a clever, tuneful souffle. Although the last song is a bit plodding and anticlimactic, everything else is simply astounding. If you study, love, and are obsessed with music like your humble scribe, you'll love this CD and will regret that circumstances have caused this great group to prematurely break up..meaning there will probably be no more of this. Spilt Milk's predecessor, Bellybutton, is equally great but not as intricate and all over the map like its successor is...I especially love Sebrina, Paste and Plato, New Mistake, and The Glutton of Sympathy. All of you out there should own this CD...I only wish it hadn't taken me four years after it came out to discover it!"
5,Nothing Like It,"Not since the Beatles has a band come along that can change the way you look at music. I had the privalege of seeing Jellyfish three times in concert and it only accentuated my opinion of them. The words, the craft, the musicianship. Purely awesome and unforgettable. ""Brighter Day"" is a masterpiece and I have not heard a song like this in so long. Every song on Spilt Milk and Bellybutton are great. Such an intertwining of influences- Beatles, Queen, Beach Boys, just brilliant!! I really miss the feeling I got from Jellyfish and I wish Andy Sturmer would grace us with his superb talent once again. I feel sad sometimes when I think about how great Jellyfish was and how so many people do not know the level of artists that are out there besides for the commercial [stuff] shoved down our throats each day by TV and radio. You must listen to this CD. If you are music lover, you will be hooked. Jellyfish come back!!!"
3,Stop! Coloaborate and listen.,"You know, If Korn put out the exact same album, this'd be platinum by now. I played this album for some friends without telling them who it was. They thought it was pretty good. When they asked who it was, I replied ""Vanilla Ice."" They didn't believe me until I showed them the album cover. This isn't my thing, but it takes guts to reinvent yourself, and that's what Vanilla Ice had. I bought this because he deserves your money more than anyone else does."
3,"""Ice is back with a brand new invention""","That about sums it up. He obviously isn't doing this for cash (watch Inside the Music). Some pretty good attempts at a new style although the lyrics could use a bit more creativity. For fans of diverse sounds, this is worth a listen, just don't expect david bowie riffs."
2,TOTAL RIP OFF OF KORN!!!!!!!!!!,"this cd is just brutal, theres no style to it and most of the lyrics are reused......OH ya i forgot HAHAHAHAHAAHHAAHAHHAHAAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHHHHAHAHHAHAHAAAHAHAHAHHAAHAAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHH."
1,Latest Effort a Let-down,"Vanilla Ice's newest CD, Hard to Swallow is a far different product than many expected. Unlike his past ventures in the music world, this album sounds at times like a cross between bad 311 tribute band and a bad TOOL imitator. Fans waiting for his PG rated rap can stay away from this album, for Vanilla Ice has suddenly taken to cursing like there was no tommorow. Overall, it would be better received if he stuck to his rap roots and didn't seel out to yelling over hard, heavy guitar riffs."
1,HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!,"This has got to be one of the WORST albums ever recorded in any musical genre. It is worth picking up if you can find it for very little money, just to laugh at it. Vanilla Ice will go down in history for being one of the biggest buffoons to ever make it in music, and that's saying something!"
1,What happend to the Vanilla Ice I used to know?,"What happend? I used to love his music and his songs, now I don't know what to think! After previewing this cd, I don't think I will be buying it. What kind of music do you even call this? Its not rap anymore. Just like all the other white guys trying to rap, it somehow turns to Rock. Sorry V, but you've lost it."
3,"You really tried...gotta give you some credit, I guess","Ok, first off, he tried, yeah...but he failed. This is one of the worst albums of the century. Followed closely by Korn and Limp Bizkit. Also, to the guy who said Korn and Slayer were in the same category, get a clue. You obviously know nothing about metal. Korn and Slayer are nothing alike, and never ever will be alike. As for Vanilla Ice, you are not punk. You are not hardcore. Why don't you just come out and admit that you're doing the music that makes money? Let's see...early 90's RAP...oh, what a coincidence...rap was big in the early 90's...Mid 90's gangsta rap..OH! Gangsta Rap was big in the Mid 90's...now, in 1998, rap/metal is getting big, and what type of music are you doing again? The defense rests, your honor."
2,Disappointed,"I love the cookbook itself, I call it the Bible of cooking, I was highly disappointed with the copy I received. Yes, it was cheap, but that is no excuse for it being dirty and having loose pages and the binding hanging on by a thread, literally. A little elmers glue and a damp wash cloth, maybe some 409 would have greatly improved the looks of it. I had been going to give it as a wedding present and thank God, it did not arrive in time (as it should have) and I had left for the wedding 747 miles away. I really would have been upset, as it is, I have no idea what I am going to do with it, I don't feel it is in good enough condition (even after I cleaned it) to give away even and I have one already.To say the least, I was disappointed."
1,"Great movie, lousy DVD","The God of Gamblers is a super Hong Kong kung fu cheese fest, unfortunately, unless you speak Cantonese, the DVD is useless. This is because the subtitles appear cut off below the bottom of the screen (I assume due to a bad transfer). So unless you are sure a new version has been released don't buy this DVD"
3,"It's worth buying, if you're a fan of the movie.","If you really liked the movie it's worth it, because you get to hear the songs from beginning to end and understand the lyrics a little better. One of the reviewers, who said that the song ""White Cliffs of Dover"" had nothing to do with its title, should have listened to the words, right at the start (""There'll be blue birds over/The white cliffs of Dover"" anyone?) I like the old, second world war sound that it has. I just wish they had included the movie version of ""The Crying Game"", the one that's sung by the leading lady. I don't like the original version (why couldn't they have left that one out?) and the Boy George/Pet Shop Boys version is a flop. It just doesn't have the same glamour and intensity, or beauty for that matter. For fans only."
5,Trance at it's greatest!,"This is my favorite kind of music, and this CD has it all. From PPK's haunting ""Resurrection"" to Dee Dee's promising ""Forever"" from Marc et Claude's ""Tremble"" to DJ Encore and Engelina's ""I See Right Through To You"" (by far one of my favorite songs of all time), this CD is sure to delight you if you're a hard party going, music loving, clubbin' kind of person.If you are at all interested in this CD, make sure you check out Louie DeVito's ""Dance Factory,"" Encore and Engelina's award winning album ""Intuition,"" or anything by Iio, Darude, Amber, or Rui Da Silva."
5,Awesome! Words can't describe this awesome vibe....,"I bought this by accident after I wasted $$$ on trance and techno to find the ultimate! I listen to this album all the time and on auto repeat... I love it for breakfast, lunch, dinner and afterhours... WARNING: You will want to dance till the cows come home!"
1,Avoid it,"I brought this home and had it up and running pretty quickly. I didn't experience problems transferring video from a VCR to my computer.So why one star?Well, I feel the box and their ads are misleading. The DVC 80 can only capture video in AVI format, with dimensions of 360 x 240, about half the size of of a TV screen. There is no mention of this anywhere in the minimal documentation that comes with the item. I thought I was doing something wrong, and tried to get in touch with customer service, but the wait on the phone was too long. I finally got an email to them, and their only response was that if I wanted MPEG-2, or a resolution of 720 x 480, I should have bought the DVC 150. It would have been nice to know that before I put out my money."
2,Not a true soundtrack,"I was disappointed upon receiving this CD. I had been looking for the original music from the series that we so enjoyed hearing. This CD is a compilation of songs ""inspired by Armistead Maupin's Tales of the City,"" according to the liner. These are simply the original recordings of the songs of the era that were heard at random times throughout the series."
3,Not for everyone,"The drawings for this book are amazing and have a dreamy quality (almost out of focus, but not quite) but they are a little on the dark side and thus difficult to make out for bedtime reading. The book is of course based on the enchanting Walt Whitman poem (""When I heard the learn'd astronomer; When the proofs, the figures, were ranged in columns before me; When I was shown the charts and the diagrams, to add, divide, andmeasure them; When I, sitting, heard the astronomer, where he lectured with much applause in the lecture-room, How soon, unaccountable, I became tired and sick; Till rising and gliding out, I wander'd off by myself,In the mystical moist night-air, and from time to time, Look'd up in perfect silence at the stars""). The fact that this book is a short read and may not be ideal for a dark room may put off some parents - just so you know."
3,frank's not the only one,"You Frank fans seem to forget that Frank is also an ego in and of himself. The other singers have just as great standing (some better...Barbara and Arethra) as Sinatra himself. WAKE UP! Frank is not the only man God chose to give a great voice! And I must say for added measure, Bono I believe adds a bit of spark and spice to a once lacking song!"
5,Sing along!,"I love Sinatra's Duets. But it really is Trio as I cannot help but sing along. It makes the freeway bearable. I must look strange. Of course his voice isn't as good as his early years or the 60's and 70's. But a Sinatra fan has all those old ones and the combination of these voices is just great. Most of all I loved ""I've Got You Under My Skin""."
2,Put this one on your list ... but not near the top,"By 1993, Sinatra's voice had lost its flexibility and range, but the old timbre comes through -- once in a while. An interesting album for the completist, but for the listener interested in a Sinatra sampler invest in the Columbia, Capitol and Reprise ""Best of"" sets. Stay away from this and Duets II."
5,Seeking healing and tranquility.,"I ordered this book after reading an article about how effective aromas help us in mood, and finding tranquility. Very pleased with the book, but it may take a while to learn to make my own. Thank you for such helpful information on healing."
5,enjoyable suspense,"I use to watch Murder She Wrote on TV and I'm so happy to have it on DVD so I can watch anytime I want. It is always entertaining and full of suspense. It's far better than the blood, guts and sex garbage that's on the TV now. The packaging through Amazon is always top notch and super fast delivery. I like the ""free ""super saver shipping"" very much."
2,Format,Did not view.Do not care for the two sided format.Good TV series but would prefer it on a single disc.
4,It's Legend with Better Characters,"The plot of this book is the same as Legend. A small band of farmers are hopelessly outnumbered against a larger, well-trained force. They defend a castle against a siege. The bad guys have Joinings this time, which are basically were-beasts if the full moon was up 24/7. The characters are more interesting and more likeable in this book.So, it's basically Legend with tougher good guys and tougher bad guys.I had a few problems with Legend and this book regarding the pacing. Gemmell does an excellent job at setting up the battles. The build up in both books is great! However, at times, the battles are just glossed over and you just hear that so and so won the duel in 2 minutes. Personally, I'd like to read what happened in the duel. So, there were a few parts in the book that did this and I was slightly annoyed.If you liked Legend and don't mind the deja vu, you need to pick this one up. If you didn't like Legend, skip it."
5,Gemmell's Best Overall Book,"This book is the epitome of what a good heroic fantasy novel is supposed to be. The characters are all to human & run the range of emotions with a clarity that is almost eerie. David Gemmell is without a doubt the BEST fantasy author ever to pick up the pen. Only Paul Edwin Zimmer has written Heroic Fantasy of this caliber (with his 'Dark Border' novels). WARNING-Once you read Gemmell's books, you will have a hard time accepting the cheesy, boring fantasy stuff being pumped out by lesser authors..."
3,The only David Gemmell book I don't like,"After the plot of ""Legand"" this is a tremendous letdown. I mean its a common David Gemmell plot device to have people face crazy odds and survive i'm ok with this. Usually I do care an awful lot about the charecters and that just does not happen for me here. Parts of it are still cool but some parts are equally dificult to follow.Overall-If you want a really good Drenai book check out ""Hero in the Shadows"". That book is much better then this one."
4,Great!! vampire literature,I loved this book. I couldn't put it down i wish that there was a second part I would love to find out what happens next. It has been many years since this book was published and i hope that there will be another one.
3,ok if you dont care at all about quality,The video capture quality for this thing is only 240x320. 2 stars on video capture. Card 6 in 1 reader is awsome. 10 out of 5 stars on it.
4,A good album - that no one bought,"This was the follow up to their excellent debut Indian Warrior. Songwriting was more uneven (hit and miss) but the production was better on this one. Less Native American references on this one.Standounts are Faceless Days and Make My Day.I always felt that this bands sound was closest to Screaming Trees (expecally the album Dirt), people also often mention Bad Company but that applies better to the first album."
1,Emachines won't support their bad product,My T6420 stopped booting up. Emachines tech support said the motherboard was bad. This is 6 months after the 1 year warranty expired. They told me to call the Emachines replacement parts phone number. Emachines parts department said they do not offer a replacement motherboard.
1,Enjoy replacing motherboards??,Read the press on this machine its pathetic. Mine died after 18 months (apparently a LONG time for this machine). Unless you enjoy replacing mother boards every year or enjoy getting involved in Class Actions such as the one being taken against the manufacturer because of this problem don't even consider - its ****
2,Awful,"I have been wanting to check him out on tour, but usually miss the dates, so I got this DVD just to see one of his shows. It is terrible, I don't even think he is playing guitar. At one point he goes into the crowd for way too long. There were many awkward moments."
2,Horribly miscast lead role,"It would have been a solid four stars if not for the jarringly awful Rodrigo lead played by John Doman. Wow is he ever bad. A listless, emotionless portrayal, and that accent! Come on! Its a European production, could you not find a European actor? If not Italian or Spanish, at least British?? His accent is just brutal in this role, and comes off so false and contrived it ruins the whole show. Had to stop watching after two episodes. Costumes and other actors were well done, but writing is trite and often laughable. Pity, could have been awesome."
2,Disappointed in quality,"I was very disappointed in the quality of this copy. It was not crisp, as if it had been copied too many times. I would not buy from this seller again."
4,good to study,this guide is more for couples who have complications with their K-1 visa or couples who expect a grilling in the hotseat such as marrying an illegal immigrant for example.the author is some lawyer from Africa who's been to a million interviews. He knows his stuff.
1,not a jigger or measured shot,"I bought a set similar to this from [...] years ago and was happy to see these with the little color in the bottom. Great idea! HOWEVER, the glass was not blown properly and the bulb in the bottom should measure 1 oz, and the flute should measure 1 oz. Each shot glass has a different measure and none of them measure 2oz. Find the real thing even if it costs a bit more!"
1,Wow,"Just watched this on hulu and I have to say this was the worst film in the history of cinema. No sort of coherent plot, terrible acting, confusing camera work, poor lighting, and zombie clown witch stuffed animal demons?I rate this zero stars but amazon wont let me."
5,Great Product; Improved Shipping,"I ordered the glasses despite the concerns listed about packaging below. I ordered two boxes, and the glasses arrived individually packed and padded, nothing broken.For table service, the glasses have a good weight and feel -- far better than light plastic substitutes which are not satisfactory in most settings. On the negative side, they are not well suited for residential dishwashers. The fluted opening limits where they can be placed in residential dishwashers. They work fine in commercial dishwashers.On the table, they are great for displaying a colorful dessert, especially layered desserts. I serve a chocolate coffee mousse in them, and they show well."
2,Not so good-Buy tweezerman instead,Bought this and found it didnt grab so good. Better to invest in the tweezerman equivalent which costs more i believe but better as a permanent solution
1,Substitution,"Ordered Panasonic, notified they were sending Energizer, received Jensen JTB507.Don't know how good the Jensen batteries are but I should have been notified of substitution."
1,POOR ALBUM,"repetitive and just boring in comparison with low end, beats rhymes, and midnight marauders."
3,Sufficiently predictable,"TLM was a decent enough album to end these 90's rap kings on a respectable note, though aside from providing a lengthy bumpin' time, provides little in the way of innovation and multi-genre experimentation that helped keep them apart in a crowded circle."
4,A Fitting Finale.,"For most Tribe Fans, this final studio LP was a big dissapointment, and while some of the criticism was warranted, the truth is this is actually a fitting finale to one of the greatest rap groups in history. While some of the performances here do seem a bit contrived and half-hearted, the musical foundation on sterling tracks like ""Get It Started"", ""Common Ground (Get It Going On)"" and the superb guitar showcase ""For Moms"" (featuring Spanky)are reason alone to own this collection. Q-Tip, Shaheed and Phife tried to go out with a bang, but it's obvious that their spirit was gone."
2,I would take it back if i could,"As a Muslim and a fanatic about Hip-Hop and Tribe Called Quest, i believe that this is the worst album put out by the Tribe. The Beats are whack and the lyrics are plain dull. Tribe really sold out by not maintaining their righteousness as with thier last album, and basically are talking foolishness with this album. Word to my Brothers don't let the record industry pacify and disrespect you. Maintain you righteousness and Allah Will Help You. Truly Tribe wasted their time in producing this album. THe only good thing about this album are the six bonus tracks"
2,Simply Whack!,"I am a big fan of Tribe Called Quest, and Love Movement didn't appeal to me like their last three CD's did. The only song that I cared for, and a lot about is ""Find My Way"". The rest of the songs seemed to be nothing but fillers corny crap like ""Tha Booty"". That song is the corniest I had heard since The Beastie Boys ""Brass Monkey"". I am particularly dissapointed that the song ""The Jazz"" was an awful remix instead of that beautiful melodious song on thier Low End Theory album. I hate that the boys would part after putting out something as bad as Love Movement. They have got to be joking!"
1,Not recommended,"I rented this book from the library and was shocked at some of the information I read, for the same reasons the other 1 * reviews stated. The author instructs ""slapping,"" ""water pistols"" and ""mouse traps"" as some problem solving guides. This is out of the question for my 10 pound dog. Although this may be how most of the obedience ring trains their dogs, this is not how I train my dogs.It did have a lot of information on the AKC regulations and equipment and addresses what happens when handlers over ""jerk"" their dogs. However it didn't address possible underlying issues that the dog may be having, from what I read. I felt this book gave a lot of problem solving advice, but not enough explanations on the WHY's. As an ""expert obedience"" book, I think it should address some sort of dog behavior. I personally wouldn't recommend this book to any of my friends or family."
2,Why does everyone love this game?,"I got persuaded into buying this game by the irresistable monkey characters, but soon found myself playing one of the most frustrating games of 2002. I personally own 14 game systems, and easily over 1,000 games, and this game can't hang with any of them. Yeah, it's fun for about an hour, but lets face it: The game is designed for people that like to be repeatedly killed, often by powers that they can't control. The later levels mostly rely on luck, partially due to the camera (which you can't control or rotate around the monkey). The graphics look like they were designed for the N64, and the ""story"" feels tacked on and has nothing to do with the game. Many people talk about how great the mini-games are, but they are much less sophisticated than those in Mario Party (and also are fewer in number). I just think Sega can do better."
5,Barrel of monkeys...no BARRELS OF FUN!,Super Mokey ball 2 is an awesome game. i have never played the original so I got this one. It is mainly 4 player a party game. it also has a single player mode. It is extremely fun.
3,Not the best Game,"Ok, don't get me wrong, the game is OK. It's just boring after a while! The graphics are ok but I swear I havn't played it for a year."
3,Cute and Bittersweet,"The controls being so simple for such a hard game is rather ironic.I picked this cute looking game up at a flea market since I was dying for a new game to play on my GameCube. This was the only one that looked good among the ones in the display case. I thought I had spotted Soul Caliber in there, but I'm not familiar with that series.I popped the disc in and was amused its silliness. Well, I got bored rather quickly. I made it to the fourth and fifth levels and was honestly not excited to keep continuing. It just got more and more frustrating and repetitive. Some easy, some hard.The mini-games are much more interesting than the story mode. I found that the Challenge Mode was more appropriate for this type of game.Maybe I'll give this to one of my little cousins or the Goodwill where someone may like it better than I did."
2,Dissapointing,"After loving monkey ball one me and my girlfriend decided to pick up monkey ball 2, hoping for the same addicting gameplay on such party games as monkey target and monkey bowling, but with a few more stages and such. What we got was a game that somehow totally ruined the franchise. Monkey target all of a sudden requires no skill, they basically throw points at you, and 2 players going at once? Sounds good but it just makes the huge stages harder to see. Monkey bowlings still god though right? No! All of the monkeys now bowl drastically differently, meaning that if you liked gongon in monkey ball one, you now will have to pick a totally different character to bowl like you want to. Oh and the one player story mode.... let me just barf now. Amazingly kiddy ish, it might as well have been designed by 2 years olds who like bright colors and the word poo. Pick up monkey ball one and leave this sad try at a sequal in the bargain bin."
1,Didn't like it!,The only thing this game has going for it was how cute the monkies are. Other than that it's STUPID!!
5,Love it,"I loved all of the songs it was awesome!!! I especially love the song ""Ooh baby"" and ""You really got a hold on me""."
4,It' s about time!,"Let's face it guys, women have had the advantage over us for quite some time. When it comes to sex, they have the power to say yes or no. Prepare yourseves for an equalizer. This book gives the basics of who she is no matter who she is along with ideas of ways to seduce her. Good hunting!"
2,but two songs are good,"I liked tracks 2 and 7(otherwise, I ended up not liking this album and got rid of it)"
5,Very Nice Watch,"I own several Invicta watches and this is my favorite. Simple, elegant and it says all Swiss made. I havn't had it for that long so we'll see if it holds up. One of my Invicta's watches hands fell off while I was mowing the lawn a couple weeks ago. It's under warranty so I expect it will be replaced and I'm mowing watchless from now on."
1,Terrible products,"Thought this would be great for computing from the recliner...but the air mouse barely works, even with the receiver right next to it on a USB extension cord. My keybord refused to sync after I simply chaged the batteries. This has been a buggy, frustrating mess and I can't imagine how these guys could, in good conscience, release these lousy products. When I get my replacement unit, I will get what I can for it on ebay and buy something from Logitech or Microsoft.Incidentally, I am an A+ Certified computer tech, so I know when something simply doesn't work. This company makes junk."
3,kensinton,"I'm not use to inverted keys on a keyboard. That and for watching a movie on my IMAC it sucks. There is no way to make the sound louder.Aside from all that it was easy to install, because its' black it won't get as dirty as it would with my broken white apple keyboard, and above all the shift key works. Now I can send emails.Even though it only cost $8.00, due to late arrival, I'll probably invest in an APPLE keyboard."
2,Mac Users Look Elsewhere,"This will work on a Mac, yes, but if you're spoiled on shortcut keys then this is not for you. Scroll lock = F14 which will adjust your dimness and Pause/Break = F15 for brightness. F9-F11 will move your windows aside and F12 will give you the Dashboard, but there is no music/play button or volume. That's very annoying. The keyboard clacks and if you're a writer or type a lot when someone is asleep near you, it will be a bit noisy.I do give it 2 stars because it does have a caps lock light. But the better keyboard that I had before my daughter poured a cup of water in it was theLogitech Wireless Solar Keyboard K750 for Mac - Silver (920-003472). Never had an issue just don't douse it. It doesn't use batteries. Well worth the money."
3,"Works well, but the white lettering on the keys wore off unusually fast.","When I ordered this keyboard, I didn't realize the keys were shaped differently for ""comfort"". At first, I didn't think I could get used to it. But it only took a day or so. The problem now is that I have trouble going between ""normal"" keyboards and this one. I decided to keep it, but I wouldn't recommend this if you have to switch back and forth. I had my previous Dell keyboard for 7 years and the lettering was barely worn. After just a couple of months, the lettering on this keyboard was noticeably wearing off. If I had known it would do this, I wouldn't have kept it. I expected more from a Kensington product."
1,Get used to using the backspace key,"Because of the funny layout, I get a constant stream of typos, particularly some sort of square box whenever I try to shift on the right side of the keyboard.As someone who was a secretary for nearly two decades, on various keyboards, including manual and electric typewriters, it is not poor typing on my part. By now, I would be used to a slightly different keyboard. Not this time, and I've been using it for months.It's not only laid out funny but it seems small. Something keeps my fingers getting all tangled up, on top of that whole shift problem. STAY AWAY."
1,Don't but it!,"Both our computers won't recognize it even with updated drivers unless we unplug it andplug it back in, nd the space bar barely works - very inferior product."
1,Misleading advertizing,The short description of this item describes it as having a 1.2GHz processor and 1.25 G RAM. Only after proceeding to the checkout page is it possible to read a further description indicating 1.0GHz processor and 512Mb RAM.
5,Very fast service,I was very satisfied with the speedy delivery and excellent packing for the watch that I purchased. The watch came in the original box and had all of the appropriate documentation.I would definitely recommend this company to others.
3,All the marks will love it,"Stone Cold Steve Austin has proven that he can create excitement. He has proven that even with a serious neck injury hanging over him, he can still go. But what he and the WWF prove in this tape by taking away the ""censorship"" is unclear. Oh wait, I know. He proves that he can make truckloads of money for the company. Yeah, that's it. By far and away the shoving match with Mike Tyson is the highlight."
5,Wonderful sing-a-long,I received this tape as a gift from a mother who said everyone she knows can't live without it. She was right. The lyrics and music are beautiful. One side of the tape has a vocalist the other side just music so you can sing to your baby. It includes a book of lyrics. I love the fact that my baby can listen to my voice singing to her.
3,Not a comedy,"I purchased this movie thinking that it would be a comedy but it wasn't, so I was a bit disappointed. Other than that, it was an okay movie, not something to rave about but a good saturday afternoon feel good movie. The acting was good. I just felt the director could have done so much more with what they had and the talent they had but missed the opportunity. So sad."
5,essential,"for some reason i resisted getting this album for a long time. man, was i wrong....it is an amazing set of tunes, with 2 of the greatest songwriters ever. althought this was recorded at pretty much the end of johnny cash's live career, it ranks as one of the most powerful performances i've heard by the man in black. cash and willie weren't actually very close friends, but their banter and interplay on this record makes it seem like they were."
5,amazing,"I wasn't going to review anymore, but couldn't help myself. 2 legends in a recording masterpiece. buy it, and enjoy it."
1,Hip Brace Evaluation,"It will not stay fastened. The minute I begin walking, it falls off. It was a complete waste of money."
2,"Mixed review, mixed feelings.","On one hand, I really love this product. Post pregnancy, I've suffered from PSD (pubic symphysis dysfunction) and this strain support really helped isolate my inner thigh muscles so that they would contract less while walking. (Anyone who has experienced this type of pain understands how awkward it is to walk when your thighs are thoroughly tensed up.) Unfortunately, I cannot rate it highly because it began to fall apart after one week. The material used in the making is very soft -- to minimize chaffing -- which is wonderful, but, as a result, the velcro that secures the support tears it to shreds. Hope this helps you decide before you purchase!"
3,Not for big guys,"Cramer products are usually high quality and do the job. But I'm afraid ""one size fits all"" doesn't include me at 6' 2' and 250 pounds. I rigged it another way that gives some support but it is not as effective as the way it is supposed to be wrapped."
3,"More great prose, less great story.","Having become a Grant fan after For Fear of the Night, this book both delivers and comes up short. Again, I'm amazed at Grant's ability to craft words...he's terrific at it. I suspect that he could make a recipe for boiled brussel sprouts read well. However, this story is so-so at best. Giant eagles and indian curses aside, it takes way too long to get going and when it finally does, you sort of wonder why you're going that way after all. Still, it's better than the brussel sprout thing."
5,Great!!!!! Can't put it down!!!!,"Trust me on this one. I have read ALL of hers and this one along with Chances,Lady Boss and Vendetta are great. I couldn't get any sleep at all when I read these books!!!! Just be sure to read them in order."
3,Doesn't fit their socket,"I have to confirm the other review here. I also ordered the chrome socket that is recommended with this flagpole, and while both items look very nice, they do not work with each other. I simply wrapped electrical tape around the flagpole to make it fit, but it still has to be adjusted from time to time. The price is right, and both products look really nice and have held up pretty well, but be prepared to do a little extra work to make it fit."
1,For a GameCube? Don't waste your money!,The title says it all. If you want this for the GameCube DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY! It won't work for GC. OH how I wish I had read these reviews!
4,"wow, thrilling movie","Few weeks ago I bought first the limited release of the Soundtrack of John Williams score. After I heard the score I was curious about the movie and... hey, wow, its really thrilling!Marthe Keller, born in Basel (Switzerland) playing a female terrorist and together with Michael (Bruce Dern) she want make a attack to the Superbowl.Sound and picture are OK but the DVD contains no bonus features."
3,Long live Israel! (Thanks to the bad guys),"Featuring possibly the longest fuse in cinema history. With terrorists like these, Zionists can rest easy in their beds."
1,Another cheap political propaganda movie.,"I don't know why a writer took the time to write this movie. Why take the art of movie making for a different purpose. This is a typical cold war movie of the 70's. Like the ones against the japaneses, germans, rusians, native americans, or palestinians in this case. Make yourself a favor and take the money for a better movie like Saving Private Ryan, Platoon, or Schindler's List, that are inteligent movies, and not cheap propaganda.Antonio Zuluaga."
3,A film with tension & suspense building every moment,"Bruce Dern at his unhinged psychotic best as a vietinam vet who takes part in a insane plot with palestian terroists to murder 80,000 innocent people during the super bowl. Robert Shaw plays David Kabokov, an isreail commando out to foil the plot. Dern`s killer smile and outright dangerous mind is very memorable especally in one scene where he kills an innocent man while testing his bomb which is compiled of 120,000 lethal darts he plans to use during the super bowl. The only flaw in the film i saw was the editing, if the producers would of shortend the film`s length about twenty minutes or so it would of not been so prolonging. But this film certainley ranks high up there with other terroirst films. And Robert Shaw`s performance here outmatches his hideous performence in `Jaws`"
5,Angelic Layer ROCKS! ^^,"Okay, this anime by CLAMP is closer to Cardcaptor Sakura than to say, X1999. It's pretty light hearted and i would say this is one of my favorite manga series....Angelic Layer is about an 12 year old girl named Misaki Suzuhara (AKA Misakichii by her friends! ^^) who, after watching a TV commercial of Angelic Layer, wants to play Angelic Layer! She loved seeing how the smaller angel was able to defeat the larger angel, cuz she's not exactly what people would call big for her age. Someone even thought she was 9!Angelic Layer is having to ""angel"" (like dolls) fight. You use a special thing to communicate with it (Sorry, i don't know what its called.).In the beginning of Angelic Layer you'll see a newspaper like thing and if you're a CLAMP fan, you'll DEFINITELY recognize alot of the stuff they're talking about! *Grins*"
4,on the island of Ios roxette ruled.,"i first heard this album or parts of it during the summer of 88. i was in greece that summer and i heard the song The Look many times. each time it was played in a club people would go nuts and the dance floor would be packed in seconds. i was listening to mostly blues related stuff then and i still lean that way however that scene and song was highly contagious. when i got home i picked up the album and after repeated listenings i confirmed what i already knew. great album. with songs like dangerous,listen to your heart and the look it's almost a best of roxette. it's sounds a bit 80ish now but it's still a good listen and anyone interested in roxette and wants to pick up a record of theirs then this is the one. great record."
4,Roxette Look Sharp review,Great album. Roxette's first in the US. Had a couple of hits that launched them internationally.
2,Sharp Hooks,"Roxette was a Swedish duo who experienced great success on the US charts in the late 80's and early 90's. Look Sharp! was their second album and it spawned two number hits, the harder ""The Look"" with its rollicking na-na-na chorus and the ballad ""Listen To Your Heart"". The album also produced ""Dangerous"" which nearly made it to the top but peaked at number 2 and ""Dressed For Success"" which peaked at number 18. Roxette released one more hit album before fading completely from the charts by the late 90's."
3,"Authentic war Hero, from a drunken failure.","The civil war memoirs of Ulysses Hiram Grant (U.S.. Grant) is very instructive. Somewhat drawn out and lacks much personality. However, I can imagine this book reflects Grants drab emotions but intense life.Knowing that life didn't treat him well outside of the Military gives us hope that perhaps we also will find our own personal niche in this ole life. From Civil War ""buffs"" it is a great reference book and one to support the evidence that Grant was, indeed a deserving historical figure.This book is very instructive."
1,classic nickelodeon fans! dont buy this!,If your a classic nickelodeon fan you may think this is a big piece of trash. Spongebob squarepants has just gotten weird & worst. I remember the time he kept saying loser. Thats a bad word.
1,Too short and easy,"This game is too short and simple. I bought this game with my allowance money for $.., and it definetly isn't worth it.I will definitely be reading reviews on Amazon.com before purchasing any games in the future.The graphics are ok and it is fun but I would definitely not recommend this game to any SpongeBob fans. I enjoyed seeing characters from the TV show but when the game ended I was extremely disappointed. ALso the short video clips were funny (especially the scences with Patrick in them). In conclusion this SpongeBob game was a real let down.-A disappointed 10 year old"
4,Kind Of EASYYYYYYY Part 1,This game is pretty easy when you get to know it. There are 4 chapters in the game...Chapter 1:Employee Of The Year:eeeesayChapter 2:Hitting Rock Bottom:more easyI`ll put the other 2 chapters in another review.
4,Steelers + UNO = great idea!!,"I bought this for my daughter for Christmas because we love to play UNO and watch the Steelers. So this was a perfect combination when I saw this on Amazon. It comes in a metal tin to store the cards. You get a variety of players from , Roethlisberger, Ward, Parker, Bettis, Randle El's 43 yd pass, Farrior, Porter, and even the kicker Reed is on a card. My only complain is the quality of print on the card. The card stock feels thinner than the original UNO cards. Also the four colors, red, blue yellow and green is not as glossy and bright."
4,Wigwam Warm,Another- asked for-delivered. Love these socks. Great for my cold feet. Wear tuff. Gotta get some more. :-) Thank you.
5,Absolutely the best sock out there,"From a gal who wears men's socks because I ain't no fool. If you want warm feet and a good quality sock, buy these. You will not be disappointed."
4,Fantastic socks,"Not only are these comfortable, but they are warm and durable. I've been using them for snowboarding to riding motorcycles and they hold up better than any other socks."
3,"Soft, but not as warm and a little tight","These socks are not bad, but they are not nearly as great as the other reviews make them sound. I ordered the extra large size, which I thought would be a generous fit since my shoe size is 12-13. So I was surprised at how tight they are, and they also don't go up as far as I had expected. The material feels very nice, very soft, and not scratchy at all. But it's not as warm as other wool I have had (which, admittedly, was scratchier)."
2,Seems like a lighter weave,My previously ordered Wigwam Comfort Hiker socks all rated five stars. I'm disappointed with these because they seem to have a less dense weave and do not produce the same cushioning effect as I have come to expect from this brand and type of sock.
1,Too Difficult to Use!!,"I bought this seat because Consumer Reports recommended it. However, apparently nobody at Consumer Reports has children because if they did they would not approve of this seat. It's difficult to install (which could be due to the seats in our SUV), it is too hard to line up the buckle to snap it in (who would design such a buckle?!? And that's when our daughter is sitting patiently- I can't imagine if she were throwing a fit or squirming around), and it's impossible to tighten the straps. We are very [...] when it comes to making sure that the seat is installed with a very tight fit (no slipping around on the seat) and not being able to get more than 2 fingers under the shoulder straps. It is impossible to do with this seat. I'm returning it and looking for a more user friendly seat!! Consumer Reports hasn't let us down until now!"
5,An awesome Belt Positioning Booster for big kids!,"I cannot rate this seat when used as a 5 point harness but it is totally awesome for older kids that still need a positioner. My son is 6 years old, weighs 80 pounds and is a little over 50 inches. He still needs a positioner but we couldn't find one that accomodated his large frame. This one does! It's roomy enough to be comfortable. The seat is wide and deep so the legs don't dangle. I never would have thought to purchase a convertible for my 6 year old but this seat has proved to be the best for big kids, IMO. It's a much better investment than the turbo booster or the Parkway - both of which are way smaller than this one. The only other booster I would have considered is the Komfort Kruiser but those are hard to find.Bottom line, if your kid is on the big side - test this booster before buying any other. This one should fit your kid the best!"
4,Good Product...just one problem,"We bought this car seat thinking it would be the ""best""...it's a great car seat but the one problem is the head support. The pillow is too high so when our daughter sleeps, her head falls over leaving the straps hitting her neck. I would recommend this car seat but would also tell you to get some kind of pill for when your child falls asleep."
1,Not a good car seat!,"This car seat looks nice and seems convient. However the straps twist so easily. Also when used with the straps my son could not reach the cupholder and was very upset because he wanted to use it. When you recline it you have to redo the seatbelt completely and then the base sticks way out. Also there is hardly and padding in the lower back area, it actually goes in. This is a terrible car seat when used with the five point harness, maybe it's better as a belt positioning booster, but I'm not going to wait that long to see!!"
3,Not a carseat for small back seats...wouldn't buy it just for the extra features.,"I bought this for the extra features of padding on the straps, the cup holder, the arm rests etc. But for the past 1 1/2 yrs. that we have had it, my daughter has never used the cup holder...it's in an awkward place, she never uses the arm rests, and the padding on the straps doesn't keep them from twisting up as I had hoped. The biggest problem we've had with this booster seat is with the large base...in a small car it takes up too much space and if you have another baby seat and try to sit someone with them...there is just no room."
2,The Revlon Nail Whitener Pencil sounds like a ...,"The Revlon Nail Whitener Pencil sounds like a wonderful idea. The idea that you can make the tips of your nails extra white is fantastic. The problem is that it didn't make much of a difference to my nails. Also, the white of the pencil came off on the tips of my fingers. If they improved this product, I would be willing to try it one more time."
3,"OK movie, deceptive cover","The DVD cover for this movie is baffling -- there is no floating ghostly little girl to be found in the movie. And the movie isn't much of a horror movie, either. It's much more of a psychological drama about a troubled family (not including a little girl, by the way) whose move to a country estate triggers a bunch of previously pent-up animosities. There's some discussion of the supernatural and a murder committed at the instigation of the husband's ancestor, but any payoff for that angle is definitely lacking. Not a bad movie, some beautiful scenery, but you won't get your horror movie fix from this one."
3,Lovely design - poor quality control,I purchased this 10k ring in lieu of the 14k with plans to have the stone re-mounted in a more solid ring setting by my jeweler. The setting is actually nice (wish I had purchased the 14k.)The stone is the problem - it is not cut properly. One end of the stone is angled down into the ring which ruins the nice rectangular/oblong look of the ring.Quality control must have had the day off when this ring was made.I also have the matching earrings & necklace which I love (I placed the pendant on a heavier chain)
5,STUNNING,I can agree with most of the comments. It was most helpful to know that band runs longer as that was my need...Perfect for me. As for the stem being 'buried' I feel that is a plus being a safety feature..Can't be accidentally broken or pulled out thus stopping time.Lots of bling for your buck. Very dressy looking and as I wear mostly two-tone jewelry .. really great.Easy to read time even for these 85-year-old eyes either with or without bifocals..
3,Halo on the Horizon,"Kyle Davis' 1994 CD ""Waiting for You"" has a nice mix of soft pop tunes with catchy melodies, hooks, and his expressive vocals. The title track is produced by Don Dixon. ""Long Hard Look"" is a tune about sea faring people that is propelled by the short thump of Davis' rhythm guitar, ""There's a halo hanging on the horizon, there's a fishing boat leaving out of Tangier Island, 20 miles out travel a day, working the waters on the Chesapeake Bay."" One of the best tracks is ""The Bitter End"" with a distinctive melody and hooks, ""This is a race I want to run, if this is a taste, don't lead me on just to arrive at the bitter end, a fool."" ""Heaven Help Us"" is a peppy track with tasty electric guitar by George Marinelli. Davis mines the pop territory perhaps that brings to mind Seals & Croft. While he's very pleasant to listen to, many of the songs are a bit too soft and sound too much alike. When his formula works as on ""The Bitter End,"" his music is a real pleasure. Enjoy!"
4,A solid live release from `85.,"This three disc set is the only official release from `85.It includes songs rarely seen on other live releases from The Grateful dead like 'spoonful','lost sailor','gimmie some lovin','she belongs to me','gloria' and 'keep your day job'.This show would be 100 percent perfect if not for the fact that Jerry Garcia`s vocals are a bit weak on 'high time' and 'he`s gone' from the second disc.Otherwise this show if filled with top-notch performances and rarely played songs."
4,A good read with lessons to be learned.,I can't remember when I have enjoyed a book about food as much as I have enjoyed this one. Plus the added attraction of learning cooking tips and tricks in the process. I don't always agree with Mr. Steingarten's opinions but I certainly respect the authority with which he states them! I leave the book around my country home and the laughter that comes from the hammock in the garden usually means that a guest has opened to any random chapter that has captured their attention. I highly recommend this read!
5,Best. Book. Ever.,"Absolutely hilarious. If you are not already obsessed with food, you will be when you are done reading."
3,Buy secondhand or take out of library,I read the whole book and all I remember is him torturing his wife with fake buttered toast. The woman is a saint.
5,useful,I have been searching for this item for quite some time. I finally found it and I love it. It is very useful and I use it to hang various items from my gutters.
3,Interesting live recording,"This is a rare *LIVE* Muslimgauze recording. Interesting stuff - I would have enjoyed seeing it. The CD is good, but by no means essential. It's probably of interest mainly to collectors. The CD consists of one long track, so be ready to fast forward. Perhaps three stars are too few. Basically my thinking is, even a one star Muslimgauze CD is still pretty fantastic. This is cool, but I'd buy many other Muslimgauze CDs before this including, Azzazin, Sufig, Hand of Fatima, Maroon, Citadel, Fatah Guerrila, Veiled Sisters . . . man, there are so many good ones!"
4,EC Dub........EC Dub............EC Dub!,"First off, I enjoyed this album. I am a big fan of promotions that put out a theme music album. So therefore, this album was a must for me. I am realy into the wrestling theme music genre, so it is cool when an album like this gets released. Instead of going to ""wrestling theme sites"" I can go to my local music store and pick this up. My favorite tracks here are: ""Walk"" by Kilgore(RVD'S theme), ""Snap Your Fingers, Snap Your Neck"" by Grinspoon(Justin Credible's theme), and ""The Zoo"" by Bruce Dickinson.Also, the addition of the ECW theme is a plus for this album. So I have to say this album's rating is not quite RVD'S ""5 STAR FROG SPLASH"" but just under at 4."
5,ECW! ECW!! ECW!!!,"I LOVE this cd! Awesome from start to finish. This cd is structured very well with great tunes and the ECW intro song: This Is Extreme! which I have heard many times. This cd is for ECW fans! If You are an ECW fan and don't have this, get out of your cave and get this! It's worth your money! I am an ECW fan 4-Life and throughly enjoy this cd! Please pick up a copy today of the greatest wrestling promotion in the world's music! You won't be sorry!!!"
1,Terrible,This is awful these songs are the worst in the world. ECW is horrible and so is it's music.
2,Could been better,THIS CD HAD POTENTIAL. BUT ASALWAY'S ECW FAIL'S.THEY WILLALWAY'S FAIL AS LONG AS THEYARE AFRAID TO GO THE DISTANCE.SUCH AS WWF DOES.ECW WONT DOIT.
4,East of the Full Moon - Deuter,"Music is very good, nice to listen to on a hectic day. Only thing wrong was holding tines in the Cd case were all broken, but I had a spare. Over all please with my selection. Heard the music on Moodscapes channel on Dish. It a great way to advertise. Thumbs up!"
5,Peaceful,"Love, love, love this CD. This was my second Deuter CD after Koyasan Reiki Healing (which I highly recommend as well). The music transports you to peacefulness... I play it whenever, happy, meditative, working.... just brings a stillness and centering to me."
5,Perfect fit for my 6-year old,"We're taking my granddaughter on vacation with us this summer. We're staying over the water in Moorea, Tahiti. She's a little water bug and will want to spend all her time in the water while we're there. Though she's an excellent swimmer (for a 6 year old) in a pool, we're on a large bay near the ocean with tidal currents to be concerned about. She has to be protected. She loves her snorkel vest and has even been able use it while snorkeling with the schools of leopard sharks and bat rays that come to a beach annually near our home in San Diego. The vest is bright yellow so keeps her visible from nearby boat and kayak traffic. Very well constructed, I know it will last her for many years. I was so impressed, I bought an adult size for myself."
3,the only metal band I know of to use whistling...,"Okay, they were a little bit campy back then, but The Lady Wore Black is a pretty nifty number. I didn't see it in the other reviews but I recall them being considered as almost a glam band at the time this record came out. In my opinion, I think that throughout their career Queensryche had some of the most intelligent, thoughtful lyrics of any metal band. If you prefer a little more than ""Odes to Death"" in your metal, you may want to take a listen to this, there first try."
4,PROMISING START !,"There are five great metal songs on this CD by Queensryche, their first recording. IT's strong, fast-paced, good riffs, good chorus, amazing singer. It will make good to any metal-fan collection."
3,Disappointed,"I bought this book in order to complete a continuing education requirement as a psychologist. The book is ok, perhaps better for a beginner. The test was totally unrelated to the material in the book, and that is what disappointed me so much. I ended up not reading the book, taking the test anyway and passing. So, if you buy this book for continuing ed, look out."
2,Try: Bill's Sliver Gripper Tweezers,"Try: Bill's Sliver Gripper TweezersI have not purchased any other tweezers after using Bill's Sliver Gripper Tweezers, they are simply the best, easiest and most painless tweezers I have ever used.... And Amazon has them!"
4,GOOD BOOK!,"i think this was a really great book. i learned alot from it. the one thing with self help books like this is that you shouldnt read them right when youre feeling like you are cutting. alot of these books share other peoples stories, and in those stories they tell their techniques and really precise steps they took and how they did it. NOT GOOD IF READ WHILE FEELING LIKE CUTTING! but otherwise GREAT BOOK!!! :)"
3,A Night Out with Blue Plate Special!,"When I heard ""Night Out"" and ""Work That Skirt"" I was very impresed. So I bought this album. And I can tell you it is nothing special."
4,An impressive and detailed commentary.,"An excellent reference work for scholars of East Asian history. This book documents the behind-the-scenes twists and turns of the war, its prelude, and influence upon the politics of the world powers. It utilizes new sources and argues that Korea functioned as a proxy cold-war alternative to WWIII.The only noticeable flaw is that you never really know what year you are in (or it takes a lot of backpedalling or cross-referencing to find out). The author mentions days and months frequently but almost never the year. Ultimately however, its thoroughness and objectivity left a lasting impression.It is basically a textbook, and a weighty volume at that. Reading it for pleasure rather than study, I was hoping it would draw in more diverse cultural insights, anecdotes or elements of human interest, but it remained rather bland from that standpoint."
