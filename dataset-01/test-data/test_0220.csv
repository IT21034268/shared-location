3,3 1/2,"This book was a very good, bargin. However, the cover that is displayed on the internet isn't the one the I received. The book does the job, it's just that I was expecting it to look like the one on the internet."
2,Oh Baby........,"I have read many of Dara Joy's other books and have enjoyed them. High Energy was good, I especially liked the character of Tyber and his kooky life. The mystery in High Intensity was fun but about halfway through the book I got VERY annoyed with the excessive use of the word ""baby"" (used by Tyber 'ad-nauseum' when addressing Zanita). It got worse as the book progressed, often once per page and sometimes twice. It definitely became a distraction and took away from the flow."
2,Boring!!!!!,"OK I love everything else I have ever read by Dara Joy, so when I picked this one up I thought I would be in for a good read. Now normally I'm the type that starts a book once the kids are in bed and before I know it the sun is coming up and I'm wishing 'why can't anything like that ever happen to me'...well it took three days to force myself through this one and once I was done, instead of wishing I was the herione caught up in some adventure, I was pretty happy just to be me. I could not get close to the characters, or into the story surrounding them. And what kills me is that the story line had sooo much potential...haunted manors, kitchen ghosts...I guess I'm even more disappointed because I really do enjoy Dara's other works. If you are going to check this one out I would suggest buying it used."
5,A BRILLIANT WRITER,"I was completely impressed with this book. The characters were completely drawn. The plot was very clean, so clever that it gently took me along on the house adventure until I realized at the end how expertly she had drawn me into the story.Tyber and Zanita were the Nick and Nore Charles for today. I have always loved the Thin Man so I really liked these two. The secondary characters were eccentric and fun. There is an aunti who wears 3 hats (I loved her), a strange pirate cook, who I guess was also a scientist, a really funny cat and others just as entertaining. The sex scenes were very, very hot but not offensive.I highly reccomend this book to anyone looking for a happy read. This is the first Dara Joy book I read and I am definetly searching out her others."
2,So So Book,"High Intensity--Well the title was misleading for one, I did not find anything through out the book that even came close to ""High Intensity"". Zanita and Tyber were good characters, and even if the story line was out there and some-what enjoyable I found myself skiping pages just to read more about Gregor and Mills. Because of them I gave this book two stars."
4,Good for the money,it looks more sturdy in the picture. the toy looks like it just got it at the 99c store. but it will perform as intended
5,7 month old loves it,"He plays with the rings for hours. Watches them roll and then chase them, bangs them on the floor, etc. I'm trying to teach him how to stack them."
5,fantastic,i also bought this for my nephew for his first christmas and it was cheaper and better to order it here then buy in a store..in store it was over $15 for just this!
4,Must Have from the very beginning!,"I bought these toy for my son when he was 4 months old. He loved it and still does at the age of 3. His brother is now also using it. In fact, they sometimes fight over it. It's durable, simple, doesn't require batteries, great value and strong bright colors. No maintenance is required and I'm not sure what the other customers are referring to when they talk about the blue dye leaking. I haven't experienced that at all. I would highly recommend it as a fun addition to your child's collection of basic, classic toys."
2,Hoped for more....,"We got this for our son when he was 6 mo old. He's now 11 mo old and still isn't very interested in playing with it....maybe he will eventually. Right now he will take the rings off, throw them, then moves on to something else. It's not very entertaining for him (yet?). I really liked the price though!! We'll see what happens."
3,Potentially dangerous.,"My 7 month old son received this last month, and he loves to chew on it. I took the base away from him, because he was sticking the yellow part in his mouth, and I was concerned that he would hurt himself(by gagging himself, falling over with it in his mouth, etc). I truthfully do not feel that this toy is for a 6 month old (or 7 month old's for that matter). His only interest in this toy is to chew on it or to shake the top ring to make it rattle. I didn't expect him to do more than that with it when he received it, and I'm not sure at what age he'll be able to use the toy properly, but eventually I think it will be a good learning toy."
1,Contains bpa,"Yes, this is a great toy. But, FP has confirmed that it contains bpa. For children who chew on toys, particularly young children who sometimes do this continuously, this is an unnecessary and inappropriate danger. FP knows better but prefers to sell a cheaper product instead of one that is safe for consumers. I wish I knew before we got this.I ended up buying a wooden one from Holgate. Yes, more expensive. But i can't in good conscience expose my child to chemicals we know are dangerous. Better off getting her fewer toys."
3,not that good as I thought,The toys states 6 mos + but my son is 9 and he still doesn't know what to do with it. He just throws it apart or grabs a ring in each hand and starts hitting them together and that's it. Most of the time it is standing in toy box. I'm just interested what age babies start stacking them?!
4,"inexpensive classic, kids still like it!","Ir achieved one of these as a gift for my toddler age daughter. I remember playing i with one as a small child, and kids today still like these very much. For educational value, my daughter does try to put them on in different orders to see what will happen, working on her motor skills and development. She also likes to name the colors of the rings. She hasn't shown much interest in the beads and patterns in the top red ring. This toy is really inexpensive and durable.I see other customers have complained about the blue ring having color that rubs off - I haven't had this problem at all. My daughter got hers in 2011, and all of the rings seem to retain their color just fine."
1,DO NOT PURCHASE! You will be disappointed!,"This ""blacklight bulb"" is horrible. It was a couple of inches from me and it did not make anything glow at all like a blacklight should. I tried the similar no-brand bulbs at the Halloween stores last year and returned them for the same reason, but assumed being GE brand this would be much better. I was definitely wrong, and this is going back. If you need a blacklight, stick to the fluorescent bulb tubes, not incandescent. I promise that you will be highly disappointed if you purchase this. Amazon should definitely discontinue carrying this product and the 50 watt version."
1,I ain't got it yet,"I don't have this yet, but I've been saving up for 2 months for this, and so far i got 6 bucks, pretty soon in a year or two, I'll have one, and I'll get to enjoy it jus like you guys are"
2,Go for the essentials,"... This one is alright, but with the essentials you get 12 songs which perfectly represent Damn Yankees. Yeah, there are some good songs on here, but this one also leaves out some good tunes like ""Runaway."" Just preview these two albums and you'll see what alot of the reviewers and I are saying."
3,"A Good Gothic Novel, but Not a Great One . . .","Best known for the reference that Jane Austen makes to it in her famous send-up of the Gothic genre, ""Horrid Mysteries"" is actually an English translation of a German Sturm-und-Drang (""storm and stress"") novel called ""Der Genius"" (1796), by Karl von Grosse. In truth, this is as much a ""Bildungsroman"" (a ""coming of age"" tale) as it is a Gothic novel, although it does contain an assortment of fine horrific elements. Grosse includes scenes that are surprisingly erotic (considering the work's date), and is truly ahead of his time in the candour and accuracy of his delineation of female psychology. However, the novel is over-long, repetitive, and drags at times, particulary in its ""edifying"" scenes. Worst of all, the narrator/hero (a garden-variety male ingenue) is incapable of arousing readers' sympathies. The horror scenes are inspired, but only barely justify one's commitment to this work."
1,www.artiefund.com tells the TRUE story more than the book,"So, the book is entertaining and a generally fictional account of the Mitchell Brothers. It's great at serving up the sex, drugs and lust for power and greed, but misses point in the end. Translation: Jim Mitchell is a murderer. However, the book almost raises him to high esteem! Can't figure that out... luckily, the truth of this tragic heartbreaker that tore a beautiful, well adjusted family apart (artie's family) can be found at www.artiefund.com. Please go there, and give your thoughts to the living victims -- those of artie mitchell. Artie was an incredible business man, scintillating personality, and philanthropist at heart, despite any vices editorialized candidly in X-rated."
2,This book was a conplete waste of time,"It managed to suck hours out of my life. The story itself started off with good enough ideas but only went downhill from there. Sara is an extremely brainless character without an ounce of wit. Gabriel often does very strange things and when Sara questions him he simply says ""No questions"" and the little dweeb complies. I don't buy the no questions policy or the relationship between her and Maurice. And I really think the idea of reincarnating her was stupid, she was bad enough the first time she was alive, never mind the second. The book was too long, too drawn out, and too sappy for my tastes. If your looking for something with a little bit more humor and poignacy this is not the book for you. Madeline Baker can do much better. I was really dissapointed by this so called novel."
5,"For a sceptic on Vampire stories, I was sold!",This was my first time reading a novel about Vampires. I couldn't put it down! The story was riveting and compelling. The author's expertise made you empathize with the Vampire who seemed so painfully lonely. An excellently written story!
2,"No information on ""Return Program""???","I don't understand why there is no information about the ""Return Program"" in the Product Details or Technical or Product Descriptions. Isn't it supposed to give a free cartridge for returning some number of empty cartridges? Why aren't the terms listed? What happens if they end the Return Program before you send in all your empty cartridges?The #28 prints fine, just not a lot of pages. I don't have an exact measurement - my estimate is ~200 pages of text. Unfortunately the printer driver doesn't show a numeric percentage of ink remaining, only an icon/graphic symbol. Perhaps that's the idea - numbers would allow us to accurately measure ink capacity."
2,not enough info on products,"Bought this black ink cartridge, eveidently it does not work without the color cartridge. this is a typical problem every body faces. the internet has become a huge matketing tool to push prouducts without information. I owuld have liked to know that I need two cartridges for my printer to work at all. ads ads every where... less and less iformations... commercialism will destroy the internet."
3,It does the job,Always had good luck with Lexmark printers & Ink.... I think the price is to high (just like all the rest)
2,"Works fine for a couple of days then, it got into pieces.","The adapter was good, audio worked fine but, after 2 or 3 flies, it got split in two and I had to hold it. From that day on, the audio was never the same."
4,For the Grandkids,I purchased this Blu-Ray pack as my grandchildren really liked the Spy Kids movies. They truly enjoy these videos and have watched tham many times.
1,Not impressed,"The toy looks cheap. Despite being sealed, my husband and I were sure something was missing, broken, or just not right with the item. I'm not sure exactly what I expected, but it was certainly something more exciting and ""playful"" than what arrived."
1,Waste if Money,"My son got this for his 1st birthday and has now had it over 6 months. He has zero interest in it. The ball barely stays balanced on the top...also, it is very small. Only good if the child is sitting, and once they have the coordination to hit it, they are simply to big to have interest. Very cheap and boring toy."
3,Ok toy,"We purchased this toy as a gift originally but ended up giving it to our son instead because the box it came in was beat up and looked as if it might be used. The toy was not used when we opened it, but it looked as if this product might have been sitting in the warehouse of the seller Amazon used to fulfill our order (STORE CLOSET a division of KAMCO International) for a while.My son likes hitting the ball (at 15 months), but it's not his favorite. He does it more because we get excited when he does it. Other than that, he likes the toy decorations below, which swirl."
2,Excellent Trip Hazard,"This product was given to my son, who was at the time, 13 months old. Over the last 10 months, he has never given this toy more than a parting glance.Now, the red plastic bat has given him immense pleasure. The bat makes quite an instrument of terror when aimed properly at our poor unsuspecting animals. Now don't call PETA, the red bat has been put away for the time being."
1,baseball dud,"my daughter received this as a gift for her first birthday, and i must say it was very disapointing. giving her a plastic spoon to play with would have kept her more entertained. dont waste your money on this! we're hoping the toys r us store will take it back"
5,Nice family movie,"Not the cleverest story ever told, but an adventure movie focused around a bright, energetic young girl. The producers took the time to tell it in an interesting fashion, that keeps younger viewers engaged in trying distinguish the real dialogue between characters and that between figments of their imagination. The animal interactions were cute as well.A bit sappy, but good for a family night."
2,"Jodie, you let us down. . .","This is a bland, shallow, and implausible story. It's what you'd expect of a cynical Hollywood production committee: ""Hey, let's do Home Alone meets As Good As It Gets with some computer-enhanced Astonishing Animals (with fart jokes of course). Wait, wait, wait, throw in a Strong Girl. Yeah. Everybody approves of a Strong Girl movie!""I just don't understand why Jodie Foster let herself get mixed up in this piece of junk. Usually you can trust her to be very careful about the jobs she'll accept.On the bright side, there's nothing really gratingly offensive in the movie, and it makes a sort of token effort at a preserve-the-wilderness theme."
3,Nim's Island Review,Not as great as I was hoping.Wanted to see more Island adventure.Too much of the father and thewriter trying to get to theIsland.
5,nim's Island,I saw this on instant video's it was a great family movie. Any age group would enjoy this movie. It has chills and thrills and beautiful scenery. Jody Foster is great as always. Gerard Butler yummy all the time no matter what he plays in. He has my vote. Jody is one of my favorite actresses. The little girl Amy Breslin is going to go a long way in the movies. It will be fun to watch her grow up in the movies.
2,"Decent timekeeper, but...","I bought one of these watches a year ago January. I live in the south west, where there's lots of sun, and by May this watch would turn black (the watch face) after a short time in the sun. I was traveling through Alaska, so I bought another, non-atomic, watch. In September, I returned the watch for repair. It was returned promptly, and was fine until this spring, when the face again turns black. No matter how accurate the watch, it's useless when you can't read the time!I'm a slow learner, it's my third LaCrosse watch, and they have all had this problem, so no more LaCrosse watches for me. I have one of their analog wall clocks, and really like it, since it also gets a radio signal at least once a day and is very accurate."
3,Made in China,I had the watch less than a month and the battery went dead! I called La Crosse and they told me I could send it to them and they would put a new battery in the watch but I would have to pay the shipping to them or I could take it to a local jeweler and have a new battery installed! With less than a month of use I got stuck buying a new battery!
2,"High quality recording, good buy- IF you know their music","I heard a scrap of ""Never been any reason"" during the movie Sahara and thought ""I remember and like that, I'll get a copy"", the 30 second sample you get here sounded the same as the movie bit too.Another reviewer wrote something about this song being the reason you'd buy the CD, it was for me and I'm disappointed. The sample was too short, I only thought this was the song I'd heard, by somebody, years ago. The sound quality on all songs is very good so if you actually like Head East's music(I don't)you'll get a good deal here in buying this CD."
5,Even Firefighters Hug Their Moms,"In our busy world, this book is delightful! Helps young kids realize that we all need hugs every now & then!"
3,Free Shipping,"Free shipping starts at $25, so just add something for a buck or two and you won't get charged the $33"
4,Beautiful but fragile,"i have 10 la crosse products scattered about my home and yard. i like the design, beauty, and functionality. as some reviewers have noted, quality and durability are lacking from la crosse products. like others, i assumed, since this clock was advertised as ""outdoor"", that it would take rain and sun. duh. when i read in the owners manual that it wouldn't, i called la crosse. they told me it would take light, but not heavy, rain. fine. i moved it under an overhang. it works fine and looks great."
4,La Crosse Tech clock,Great clock. But the other 2 indicaters are to small to read at a bit of a hieght. But Just the clock is great.
1,atomic clock went wacko in less than a year,Loved the clock at first but with the first daylight savings time adjustment the clock went wacky and the therometer stopped working. Initially we called the company when the problem started but it quickly felt like were jumping through hoops and never got satisfaction. We should have packed it back up and returned it to Lowe's. I would not purchase this items again.
2,No more accurate time,"Had this clock for a little over 3 yrs but recently I cannot get it to keep accurate time anymore. I have put new batteries in it, stationed it facing Colorado and called customer service too. Nothing has worked at trying to get this clock to read accurately anymore. 5 stars when it worked, 1 stars because it doesn't and minus another star for only working 3 yrs. I think I'll just go back to buying a cheaper quartz clock as those seem to last longer."
1,A player's review,"I've been playing LoL-2 without a hint-book. Because I wanted to be sure not to miss anything of this massive game, I bought this book. I'm very sorry I did not spend the extra money on the official book because this book is missing so many things I've found without a book: 3 Mind-clusters, drying the river to get acces to a hidden room with a storm-cristal, the hidden tunnels under the savage jungle, etc. etc. This book has been a big deception, it can be used to finish the game, but it cannot be used to explore each level!!"
3,Ummm...the point was?,"Madonna's second GH collection....titled GHV2...a collection of her 90s hits. The one positive thing I can think of is, at least we have them all on one CD. However I have to wonder what the point was...oh yeah wait it was so Madonna could milk her fans for more money. To be honest, if you have all her 90s albums, you don't need this collection, unless you are some diehard who has to own everything Madonna. Otherwise it's a waste. Most of the songs are edits anyway, not even the originals. It's an interesting collection, but I say if you're a casual fan this is for you, if you have her albums then don't bother."
3,MADONNA'S 2ND DECADE,"This chronicle of the Material Girl's second decade falls short of IMMACULATE COLLECTION, her greatest 80's hits package---mainly because Madonna hasn't (musically speaking) lit up the last decade of the last century like she did the Reagan Era. By far the best tracks here were for the most part culled from her latest couple of albums, RAY OF LIGHT and MUSIC----including the title tracks from the aforementioned LP's, the Jan Hammer-like ""Power Of Good-Bye,"" ""What It Feels Like For A Girl,"" the neo-psychedelic ""Beautiful Stranger"" (from the second Austin Powers flick), and ""Don't Tell Me""(whose beginning still fakes me out)."
3,Where's the effort?,"As a hardcore fan of Madonna's, I find this release to be a large disappointment. This was clearly a rushed release. Basically, Warner's wanted to cash in on Madonna's last tour/holiday season, so, they release an album full of awful radio edits (desecrating the originals). In addition, there are no new tracks to enjoy (such as the ones included ""The Immaculate Collection"" and ""Something to Remember""). There are no Madonna-isms on ""GHV2"" (Madonna-isms were blatantly apparent on ""The Immaculate Collection"" (i.e., steamy, banned video, controversial singles, lots of hype, fantastic photo shoot, etc.)), which is a problem.Enough of my complaining, though. This is a collection for the casual Madonna fan. It's a fantastic collection of songs that happened to be edited in a not so desirable way.I'll stick to the full studio albums."
1,u r experienced!?,madonna knows something about life for sureyou can see it in her giant leaps throughout lifemarilin monro was her elvis and you can see it in the start ofher career but nothing wrong by that u live/love u learn/become 1i m goin' to use this apartunaty to also try and senda personal message to her that i m a musician myself and i wouldvery much appreshiate if she/guy richi will assist me in my ownjourney .... arias moses!?1
2,Is it really a Greatest Hits if it doesn't have the hits????,"What the hell happened to ""Rain"", ""I'll Remember"", ""Live to tell"", ""This Used to be my Playground"", etc., etc., etc (see the other reviews for other notable ommissions from this CD).No wonder nobody likes the recording/music industry. They try to squeeze every penny out of you. I guess we'll have to wait for GH volumes 3 & 4. I'm sure they'll be out soon."
3,here is the thing about madonna that i dont like....,"I feel that madonna is a brilliant artist... she always keeps her fans on her toes of see what she does next...madonna is just OVERRATED.... everytime she comes out she is always hyped a little too much...this greatest hits 2 LP was decent but lacked all of her better songs...there is no doubt that the best song on the album and her career is ""take a bow"". the song showed that she could actually sing and the video is to die 4. the video is shot beautifully by far her best video....'ray of light' 'human nature' (shows that she can rap not like the 2002 song ""american life""), 'erotica' and 'beautiful stranger' are the best songs on this LP... she showed something different in each song...overall this GH2 LP is not all that great and her first one was way better...3 stars"
2,Eh...,"I'm sure that many other hardcore Madonna fans were disappointed and wondering when they heard this album. There are countless missing songs! Bad Girl, This Used To Be My Playground, You'll See, I'll Remember, You Must Love Me, Nothing Really Matters, and of course Rain!!! What makes this greatest hits album so different the Immaculate Collection is I.C. has all of Madonna's hits from the 80's (except Who's That Girl and Dress You Up, but that's besides the point.) Sure, it has great songs like Secret and Music, but the edits are horrible! Erotica is one of my all time favorites and it's cut a minute short. My recommendation? Get all of her 90's and 00's albums, those would be your best bet for satisfaction. I think the only good thing on this album are the pictures!"
3,Should have been better,"Although the songs are, of course, superior pop hits, I lowered my rating because this collection is so strangely strung together it is obvious that the brilliant business woman Madonna had nothing to do with it.Why include ""Don't Cry for Me Argentina"" which is NOT a Madonna song, and leave out ""You Must Love Me"", which was an actual single, AND written specifically by Andrew Lloyd Webber for Madonna to sing? If they were going to include ""Argentina"" they should've opted for one of the dance remixes- now THAT would have represented Madonna's ability to make a song her own!I will admit that I am not really upset that there were no new tracks. Whenever artists put new tracks on a greatest hits album you end up with a whole bunch of hits and then 2 or 3...semi-hits. For every ""Justify My Love"" and ""You'll See"" you get stuck with a ""Rescue Me"" or ""One More Chance""Better to exclude new stuff, if its sub-par to the legacy."
3,Fun Baby Book,"Like Todd Parr's other books, this is a fun book with great illustrations. We bought it for our second child. We've had some difficulty compared to other baby books in that the pages are of ""shiny"" nature and sometimes dark making it a little difficult to find an appropriate pen to add comments."
5,This goes great in many dishes,"My whole family loves this sauce. I use it primarily to recreate a dish we had in Maui. It adds a wonderful sweet and spicy flavor to just about any sauce. Service on this order was spectacular. Several bottles arrived broken and replacements were received within days. Amazon service was fast, easy and reliable. I love Amazon. Also, there are many recipes that you can look up using this sauce that a very good. It goes spectaculary with coconut milk, vegetables, chicken or shrimp and pasta. We love it."
2,Can't get to work on Windows 7,I have not been able to get this to work with Windows 7 (it worked fine for me with Vista). I have had no problems with the older 4150 model (no joystick) working with Windows 7. Any ideas out there?
3,"Good, but not worth the price","This winch plate is solid and good quality. I have no complaints about it, but you can get one just as good, and better looking for less than a $100 elsewhere. Like AtoZ Fabrication makes a nice one for like $80 that is just as good quality."
1,Completely Worthless!,I wish they would let me give this ZERO stars. I have to agree with all other reviews. This product is completely worthless. Only one marker worked out of the 6 it came with and started running out shortly after we started using it. Airbrush a t-shirt? Give me a break. This would barely put color onto a piece of paper. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS!!!
5,The Satire Continues,"This is Nathan Wilson's second parody of Tim Lahaye and Jerry Jenkins' Left Behind series. His first, _Right Behind_, was a dynamite bundle of fun and laughs, offering a satirical look at some problems with the thinking and writing behind the Left Behind series. The chuckling continues in _Supergeddon_. While it didn't have me clutching my sides quite as much as Wilson's first, it's still a great read. Good stuff."
1,"If you are a believer, don't read this book","Basically this book makes fun of everything that LaHaye and Jenkins teach in the Left Behind series. The author bio says that Nathan Wilson is an evangelical but I find that hard to believe. I can't see a true believer mocking the book of Revelation. I know that LaHaye and Jenkins are using their own interpretations of Revelation, but their books are based on a lot of study and prayer. The content of the Left Behind series might seem far fetched or unbelievable, but if you feel that way, go to the source -- The Bible. Read the book of Revelation for yourself and don't buy this ""parody"" that mocks God's truths."
3,Good Read for Starters,"On a return trip from Florence, I bought this book at the airport because I wanted to learn more about the Medici family. Not being a historian, the book deserves great credit because it kept my attention for the long flight home and over the next few days. I wish I had read it before I went to Florence. It provides a great overview of the Medici influence, both in Florence and in Europe. The book serves as a great grand overview for someone who has never studied the history of Florence. My only problem with the book is it's pervasive homophobia. Over and over again, the author portrays certain members of the Medici family as deviant, identifying their weakness or ""profligate"" lifestyle as problematic. The book does not identify or explore the implications of being homosexual in a deeply Catholic and heterosexist culture. It simply judges members of the Medici as not being ""normal."" In every instance, gay members of the family or artists are portrayed negatively."
2,Petty soul,"I am an expatriate in Oman myself, so I purchased this book with interest.I hate to put a book away before I complete it, but this time I was tempted several times.The writer is so full of prejustices and very very self centered.Like when he was hours late for an appointment with a parent to one of his students, but still have to go swimming first (tp get some photos of himself jumping into a pool), and then later blame it on his Indian girlfriend.Or when she has to leave for India and one of his main concerns is to get his $500 back he lent her so she could keep her flat for another month, enabling him to spend every weekend there."
4,Upgrade available for Picture Navigator for Windows XP,"I recently purchase a new PC with Window XP Professional. I was having trouble downloading images to my PC, like many of the other reviews have stated. I found a download which fixed my problem.http://www.jvc.ca/en/consumer/service/s_downloads/default.asp(I selected: Picture Navigator Windows 2000 Professional and XP Update)Good luck!"
2,Buyer Beware,"Buyer beware regarding Star Packer with Lucky Texan, both starring a young John Wayne on one DVD from Westlake Entertainment. Even at $0.25 plus $2.98 shipping, this is only for those who are going to watch on a nine-inch or smaller television screen. Both source prints are soft dupes with much surface noise and drop-outs.Both films are worth watching if you buy better versions. These are early John Wayne, five-day wonders cranked out for Lone Star Pictures during the mid-1930s. John is supported by George ""Gabby Hayes"" and Yakima Canutt. The story lines are fairly simple but entertaining.If you can find this at a Dollar Store and don't care about quality, then these will suffice. But don't watch on a big screen and certainly not on an HD screen. So, thumbs up for the films but thumbs down for this DVD."
3,Good,"The stroller itself is wonderful, it works great. But the parent consol drink holders are not very deep so water bottles fall out constintly. The shipping company used was Fedex and they sucked big time. After calling them many times they finally delivered the stroller 4 days latter than was promissed, and we were denied a refund of any of our shipping fees."
5,Hiking24,"After trying similarly priced single jogging strollers, this one seemed to have the best maneuverability. I previously owned an InStep double jogging stroller that I was happy with except for a few features that were missing, but decided to give the Safari a try after reading the product description. This stroller has all the features that my previous stroller lacked; child and parent tray, the canopy is large enough to keep the sun and rain from bothering my son, adjustable handle (my older son can push the stroller too), and the seat adjusts to an upright position. I'm very pleased with my purchase. Like my other InStep stoller, this one can take a lot of abuse."
3,happy,"I do like it for the most part, including the adjustable bar. On the other hand the release bar seems to be a little flimsy and tricky. Suprised by this it seemed to be less than the one that I got before. I hope it lasts as long. They should fix this."
5,Great Stroller,"I love this stroller! Even though it says it's for 6 months and older, I have been using it with my 3 month old son. We added a head support and it works great. We don't jog with him yet, but we go for long walks and to the zoo and it works great! I love the swivel wheel it makes it so much easier to use than other joggers. This is a great product!"
2,wobbly front wheel and unstable,I got this stroller about a month ago. It worked fine for 2 days and that is it. After that I was walking around the track and the front wheel kept wobbling so crazy that other joggers and walkers stopped to help me see what was wrong with it. The wheel nearly fell off! I took sent it back asap and bought a baby trend expedition LX at target for even cheaper than this one and it is much sturdier and I don't fear that my baby will be harmed from the front wheel falling off!
4,Growing up,"In my opinion this album is a middle point between the straight-foward trash of their previous albums and their upcoming Prog-metal masterpiece ""Spheres"". There's some experimentation with guitar-synts; the songs here are not so mature as in ""Spheres"" but they are heavy and fast. Along with Atheist this band is the precursor of Progressive Death Metal; a ""must have"" for every Cynic fan."
4,An excellent effort by a wonderful collection of authors,"The first of these I have read was ELF FANTASTIC, actually, that was the first anthology of different authors I have read, but I digress. ELF FANTASTIC was a brilliant collection and I highly recommend it, there is one particular story that still sends shivers down my spine at the thought. Then I read CASTLE FANTASTIC and a few others... Most recently however, I have read WIZARD FANTASTIC, and although not as good as some of the others, this is a book I praise to the high heavens. GET THIS BOOK, or at least another of these collections!"
1,"Broke in 1 week, got replacement, broke again in 1 day","I purchased this DVD player, and after using it for 2 hours a day, for 1 week, it stopped working. I contacted Coby and was advised that I had to pay $18, even though the product has a 90 day warranty. I sent the DVD to them anyway, with the $[...] money order. I received a brand new , sealed, same model back, and this time it stopped working after just 1 day of playing DVDs. The same problem as the 1st one, it just stop reading disks. Do not buy this product, it is JUNK."
5,CBB ROX!!,What an Album! This band has it together! HIGHLY recomended to any country/country rock fan out there! GREAT STUFF!! Buy THOUSANDS!!!!
5,Savage is best of the series.,I throughly loved this book. I thought it was the best so far. Tristan was at his best. I love the wizards and the minions are by far my favorite creation. Rob you have so out done yourself with this one. I stayed up sevaral late nights reading chapter after chapter until I forced myself to go to sleep only to pick it back up in the morning. I was so sad when it was over and can't wait until the next book. Oh please hurry.
4,Organize your home gym,"It is strong, durable, and takes little space. Very stable on the ground even when weights are unbalanced, something I appreciated greatly. It won't tip over unless you push it yourself. My only criticism is its paint which chips out easily with weights brushing against it. I wish it was made of different substance that is more durable to such anticipated friction.Otherwise, this is perfect for my home gym."
3,book was too well loved,"I ordered a book from this seller for my niece. It turned out to be a library book that had a ripped cover and had obviously been read quite thoroughly many times. Not what I expected from the description. All the words were there and my niece enjoyed the book, but I was surprised at its condition."
1,TOTAL FAIL by Sweetearth and USPS..Amazon OK tho,"First, I want to be fair to Amazon, from whom I have always had good luck and service with many orders. This was ordered from Amazon and fulfilled by Sweetearth Foundation, who put this item in the mail in May of 2011 and as of October 2012 it hasn't been delivered. Not sure if it was sent book rate (last priority) or what happened but somewhere between NJ and MI the item disappeared and it had been so long (oh, it'll show up eventually won't it?)that I apparently forgot about the order. A recent prompt by Amazon reminded me of this situation. And it seems that Sweetearth has gone the way of my package because they aren't a presence on Amazon any longer either. Oh well, MY BAD (memory) but others should be reminded that USPS and mailing books can be an imperfect solution."
1,not recommended,"This is a book that can't decide whether it wants to be a recording catalog or a dictionary of jazz. It is of little use as either. It gratuitously and gracelessly interpolates into its text unsupported and arbitrary opinion. Its prose is sloppy, glib, puerile, and humorless.Recommended: PENTATONIC SCALES FOR THE JAZZ-ROCK KEYBOARDIST by Jeff Burns."
4,"Works for my Dell XPS Studio 435mt, with adapter","Replaced a dead power supply on my Dell XPS Studio 435MT with this one and it worked nearly perfectly, with one caveat. The EPS power connector on my motherboard is 8 pin, while the connector that comes with this power supply is 4-pin. It actually works to simply plug only four pins in and start up the computer, but to get this connection correct, I needed a 4 to 8 pin adapter: http://www.amazon.com/StarTech-6in-Pin-Power-Adapter/dp/B002O21XHQOtherwise, the power supply fits the case (and screw holes) exactly and all other connections were supplied and worked."
3,New life for my desktop.,"I had a recent no-start of my Dell Dimension 4600 desktop. Judging from the Dell's behavior while trying to restart, the original 250w PSU was done for. Actually I am surprised the original Dell PSU lasted this long, I heard they were prone to early failures. I tried finding a replacement OEM PSUs but they are all re-manufactured units. I ordered this one since it was new and seemed to work for my Dell for around the same cost. I did not need the extra 150w of power but it couldn't hurt either.The install was easy and fit into the tower casing perfectly. I routed all of the needed connections to the components then tied up the unused ones.This PSU did repair the power up problem....although the graphics card was also needing replacement before I was up and running again. I am very happy with this PSU so far.**Update: still working well everyday."
3,God Told Me To....Kill! that sounds fun!,"A New York City policemen investigating a series of particularly brutal homicides discovers an eerie link between the cases - when the murderers are asked why they committed the crime they all claim, ""God Told Me To.""A Very Strange Movie!"
1,Dont Buy This!,"I cant belive that someone out there rated this Magic Trick DVD with 5 starts! Its really awefull and super amateur performance, bad tricks, and you will surely waste your money!"
4,Another hidden gem,"Seems in '91 that Roadrunner and Century Media were doing the best they can to keep metal-based music alive, and the song ""Cults of Unknown"" goes a long way toward that. Kick-ass progressions and a driving verse keep your head banging!"
5,Very thorough,"I bought this product because one of the reviews of the other deck books said that this was the best book. My husband has learned a lot from it, and hopefully one day, we will actually have a deck in our yard :) Seriously, this is a good book, it is very thorough from beginning to end of the project. Highly recommended."
4,Typical Boneyism,"This is vintage Boney. He gets you hopping with tracks like, RPM and See What I'm Sayin' and then just chills with So Beautiful. He does a bit more R&B here but overall it is a decent record."
4,Boney keeps it smooth,"He has done it again, alittle differently this time around but pretty soon you will be swayed thus well worth my hard earned bucks! Sensually smooth as always and ""Its All About You""is so warm and romantic (Paula!) ITS THE BUSINESS! There are just certain songs that he does that just does it to you time after time...Enjoy!"
3,Average Product,Pluses:-------* Easy handling* Good pictures in natural light* Easy downloadDrawbacks:----------* Color of picture (often too much saturation -not lifelike)* Weak flash - makes night/indoor pictures too dark* Battery does not last for more than 20-30 flashes
2,Not so good.,"Senses fail are a band I try hard not to like.To explain, I feel they are very forced lyrically. They try mesh into an already packed genre and it just seems so obvious. They write terrible lyrics simply to appear shocking or edgy and it doesn't work. On this cd alot of the songs seem overlly offensive but then you are humming it ten minutes later, which must be a positive factor. All in all though I'd try avoid. Music which is genuine comes across that way straight off but these guys try too hard and it doesn't work."
5,"""Let It Enfold You"" best emo/screamo album of '05","After making one of the best ep's i've ever heard senses fail tops it with LEt it Enfold You. this cd is outstanding from Tie Her Down thru Martini Kiss. Their music is just mixed so well the screaming and guitar riffs will just blow you away. I love every song, its the first cd since dookie where i can listen to the album every day and not get tired of it and there is not one song i dont like. Standout tracks are definetly, Youre Cute When You Scream, Bite to Break Skin, Rum is FOr Drinking, Choke On THis, Irony of dying on YOur Birthday and MArtini Kiss.These are just in my opinion the standout tracks although every other is amazing and different from any other band. I think most teenagers can relate to Buddy's lyrics and he does a damn good job writing songs and the guitar and drums all give the songs good energy. So put down your Enema of the State and go out and buy LEt it Enfold You AND From the DEpths of Dreams."
2,ew,"i heard buried alive by senses fail and thought it was amazing so I thought maybe the rest of the CD would be too, but helll no. I was really wrong. This is garbage. I couldn't stand listening to this CD. I will never buy a senses fail CD again. Plus i saw them at bamboozle and they sucked!"
3,A Little Dissapointing.....Just a little..,"I've been a fan of Senses Fail for a while now. It was just a shame that waiting a while for their sophmore release that ""Let It Enfold You"" is just not as good. Even though this CD has some good songs such as ""You're Cute when you scream,"" ""Rum...,"" and ""Tie Her down,"" The Cd is just not as capable as their debut. I reccomend their debut more but this CD is still good. Just Be warned, this cd has many bad songs such as ""Slowdance."" Senses Fail's Debut had less (pointless) screaming(if any, depending on your thought on what screaming is) I just hope their next cd will be better, such songs such as ""Buried A Lie"" will never be as good as ""187"" on their debut.Take a Look, you might like them."
2,Great if you get the extended warranty,"We got this 3 yrs ago. For the price we paid, it was packed with features and performed well for the most part. We didn't bother with the included software since we had Pinnacle. A year ago (2 yrs after purchase) we had blotches and blackouts on tapes when viewing previously taped DVs. Went through and scratched up bunches of tapes before trying out the head cleaners. Things were ok until few months ago. The motor to eject and receive the cartridge started to get stuck. After jiggling few times, even brute force, it would be ok. Now this past weekend, after we tried to use it to tape our son's birthday party, it degenerated to the point where it's 'eating up' tapes and it takes several minutes of coaxing to get the tape to go in or out. Time for a decent burial me thinks."
1,disappointed,"Being a new mum with a fourteen month old son I, like many mums, look for an old household name like fisher price when purchasing toys and activity items for my child.I have been very disappointed with this ride on bike. My son jumps on and wants to scoot along with his bike, however this ride on is so light that it doesn't push forward, instead it slides off to the side. very frustrating for a small child. Every attempt at play with this item has ended in the bike being discarded after a minute or two.It looks nice and the steering seems ok, it is just too light.This is not usual for fisherprice so hopefully a new improved version of this ride on will be introduced."
3,Not an Outside Bike,My 18 month old son also flipped over the handlebars because of an uneven area on our driveway. Indoors it works great and he loves riding it around.
2,So disappointed!,I purchased this toy over others after reading so many positive reviews. I am extremely disappointed with this toy. My son (16 months) seemed to like it at first but it seemed he could only go backwards. When attempting to go forward his feet would get stuck by the wheels and the wheels barely turn as is. I should've saved my money. It is a great toy if you want your child to just sit and go absolutely nowhere!!
3,Take a test-drive first...,"We received this as a gift. We have a walking 14 1/2 month old who is around 31-32"" tall and he is unable to ""ride"" on the Ready Steady. His feet do not reach the floor enough to propel it around while he is sitting on the seat. It is just a little too high for him (short legs I guess). He does enjoy pushing it from the front, pushing it from the back and having me push him on it. It is just unfortunate that he is not able to use it for its intended purpose. I am going to be looking into a shorter ride-on. Try to test some ride-ons before purchasing! Also, the Ready Steady is all plastic... not the best construction we've seen."
2,My son hates this toy,"My son got one of these for Christmas. He was 9 months old. He will not ride on this thing. Everytime you put him on it he cries for you to get him off or he falls off and hits his head or something of that sort. He is now 13 months old and will not touch this. This toy may be fun for some kids but not for all. He has the hardest time moving on it when he does try to ride it, the wheels stick to carpet and will barely roll."
5,FUN!,"My two year old received this as a birthday present (from me). He loves it. It holds up well, since I have a 6 & 4 yr old that think they are two and ride it. I am not sure about educational value, I guess it is teaching him to get ready for a tricycle then bike? Starting out with the good ol' feet as pedals. At any rate, makes him feel like he can ride with the big kids and we love it."
2,Too hard to ride!,"Not meant for an athletically competent toddler... too hard to ride well and fast. I bought this for my 17-month old. While it is true that it is easy to get on and doesn't tip over, the wide wheels in the front mean that he can't really get his feet forward enough to push off well. He has to push off in choppy steps from the level of his body backwards, which is not satisfying for long. It's his only trike right now, so he still likes it, but often he ""rides"" it by standing up and walking along with the trike between his legs, carried by his hands on the handlebars!"
3,ok but not great need some gaskets,Item came with all the listed items on the package. but they need GASKETs.. as they leak like a sieve... I tried this on my water broom and I got soaked....... water spit in my face and all over me..Get some gaskets before trying this item.
1,Don't spend your money on this garbage.,"This book contains so many grammatical mistakes that it's disgusting. I actually had to reread some of the sentences so that I could understand what the author was saying. I found it very annoying when I came across multiple run-on sentences and had to take the time to mentally separate them so that I could logically connect the events in each paragraph. This book is only good for people who don't care about bad grammar, which, unfortunately, is the majorty of today's society."
4,It might help,"The pain i could also feel, the story was to close to home for me but I hope it can help someone else."
4,you'll like this new author!,"Visions of Sarah is a fascinating tale of love, betrayal, loss, and hope. When Melissa ""Mel"" Hadley looses her longtime lover to cancer, she knows her own life will eventually move on. What Mel doesn't know is how perilous the journey will be. Along the road, she must come to terms with her loss as well as her romantic feelings toward Windy, her seemingly unavailable boss and friend. As Mel tries to heal, she finds herself launched headlong into the dating scene, where she only faces more heartbreak. Eventually, Mel must examine her conflicting emotions and find the real key to peace.Zarembski is an imaginative new author with guts and instinct, qualities that give her the potential to become one of the greats in alternative romance writing.Margaret A. HelmsAuthor of Fogs in August"
3,"Rough, but good first effort","I appreciated the care the author took with the tough subject matter of grieving for a life partner. The writing is heartfelt and moving at times -- this is a two hanky book.It's a little long. Some scenes are ""more of the same"" and don't move the plot forward in any way. A good editor would have helped, and I hope Zarembski gets some good hands on editing for future works. If she did they would probably turn out really well.People who liked Visions of Sarah shouldn't miss Rebecca Montague's ""A Wild Sea"" and Karin Kallmaker's ""Watermark,"" both of which deal with the aftermath of the death of a life partner."
5,Analog to SACD done right!,"This new release of this near-legendary 1959 Dorati/LSO performance goes to the head of the class. Using the earlier CD release as a sonic guide (the series was originally overseen by Wilma Cozart Fine), Universal's audio engineers have, again, given us a nearly perfect transfer of the original master tape to this newest, most advanced digital medium. I can't imagine something more musically satisfying."
3,Hidden Towel Bar,"Great towel rack for keeping your dishtowels out of sight; simple, yet just what I needed to have handy at my sink. Installation was easy. Unable to locate this item locally, so price was more than I wanted to spend (shipping costs additional), but happy with purchase."
1,Just Read Gates of Fire,"I'm not sure how this book got 4 stars and has been compared to ""Gates of Fire."" I bought this book because I enjoy reading historical fiction, and ""Gates of Fire"" is one my all time favorites.I found this book to be a huge disappointment. Characters aren't developed to their full potential, battles are barely described, and those that are, are just plain boring. There's no passion in this book, barely a plot, and what could have been a great way to end the story, a battle to redeem one's name, is described in about 2 paragraphs.There are much better and exciting books then this. If I could return a kindle book, I would."
4,this cd is real serious,this cd put big mike on the map. after he and 3-2 hooked up on the convicts album he made a strong debut on till death do us part. then he dropped something serious. songs like playa playa daddy's home and having things make this cd a must have for any rap cd collection
5,BIG MIKE IS NO JOKE!,"THIS CD WAS ON FIRE WHEN IT FIRST CAME OUT BACK IN THE DAY. SOME OLD SCHOOL CD'S SOUND DATED AFTER AWHILE, BUT THIS CD IS STILL HOT! SOCIAL COMMENTARY, DEEP GROOVES, SOUTHERN SWAG...I MEAN TRACK AFTER TRACK, BIG MIKE GETS DOWN! I'M BUMPIN IT RIGHT NOW!"
3,Good.,"Music was good but not what I expected. Nothing wrong with it, just wasn't what I thought it was; my error. Had nothing to do with the product."
5,A classic on a decent presentation,The anime in question is a classic.The DVD package comes at a very accesible price however it lacks certain extras that may come in handy from time to time. For example: Explanation for certain pretty obscure/language jokes.
4,Azumanga Diaoh Box Set,"The series:The series is great! I've loved it since it first came out. Occasionally it can be a little slow- especially when watching Osaka, but in my opinion, it was worth buying.The product: (""class album box set"")The only bad thing I can say about it is that there are no special features of any kind. It does have the show and I guess that's what really counts. And I love it's size!"
4,"Nice, solid crate!","The crate is pretty heavy duty. I use it as an indoor kennel for my two kittens, and they fit very well in them. I like the fact that it has three doors, so you can use whichever door depending on where you have this set up. I also purchased the ""Midwest Quiet Time Pet Bed"", and it's a perfect fit. Makes the crate very comfy for them to sleep in."
3,OK quality,"Crate has several rust spots. It is a little flimsy so I don't recommend for dogs that will aggressively try to get out. Not necessarily product related, but I paid for 2 day shipping and it took 6 days to arrive."
5,Good product,"I have two of these, one for each of my australian shepherds. The pewter finish is nice and all the parts work smoothly. The wire in this crate is easily strong enough for this breed. The pan gives the appearance that it could be too light but after 6 months in the male's crate it has not broken, bent, or cracked. So it must be tougher than it looks. All in all a perfectly acceptable product, and a great deal at the Amazon price."
3,What Resonance?,"An earlier review stated that this album has a particular resonance. What resonance? Literally, the recording for this album clips Tracy's wonderful voice along with the instrumentation. They must have used some whacky production methods. As a friend put it, ""The album sounds dry. I'm getting thirsty listening to it."" That might sound weird, but that is exactly the way it sounds. In addition, the voice seems completely disconnected from the music.I like Tracy Chapman and have enjoyed all her albums to a great extent. I like this because it is still better than 99% of what's available. I just wish they had produced it better."
4,Sorry it took me so long to discover,"I'm sorry it took me so long to discover Tracy Chapman. Her past tracks that got air time I thought were great, but I never bought the CD. Finally, I bought Let It Rain and I'm glad I did. She is truly a talent, her writing skills and her sensual alto voice is a beautiful and welcome change to what is now being called music."
5,LET IT RAIN IS STELLAR!...,"This is perhaps the best album by Tracy since CROSSROADS....every track is a classic! I am not going to talk about each track because they are similarly themed in nature.....very acoustic, mellow and about finding your place in this world....if you enjoy good folk pop, RUN OUT AND BUY THIS! END OF STORY!"
3,Golf is a Game of Confcence,"Its interesting but not as good as ""Golf is not a Game of Perfect"" which is also by Rotella"
5,Classic tennis balls,"I use these all the time, they are definitely good quality tennis balls and I'd recommend them to all tennis players as well as dog owners who need some solid tennis balls to use."
5,Nice balls,Nice bouncy and firm balls. Nice and easy to play with if your a beginner. I would buy it again. I also recommend it.
3,patience,"they take forever to ship! ugh!! its been 2 days & they still haven't shipped this item. i bought something else the same day & it was ship the same day i bought, unlike this one!"
3,Penn Tennis Balls,Price is way too high! Do not buy from this seller! You can get the same tennis balls at Walmart at half the price!
2,Too expensive also,"It was it not the actual quantity described as 12 packages,which made it FAR more expensive than you can buy single tubes for everywhere else."
3,good but could be alot better,"The first cd was very good. I had to buy two copies, because i wore out the first. The second or green had two or three good songs. I really didn't care for it. This the third has really good songs on it, but it reminds me of middle eastern sand music with the orchestra. Yes travis is trying to be creative, but he was born creative. Travis is trying to hard to prove himself. He needs to relax write music that feels right and get back to some true rock'n'roll. Tantric is a good band also but, will never compare to the orginal days. Travis is loaded with talent i want to hear his great accoustic songs minus all that other noise."
5,Powers Two Bells Wired Together,"I bought this 15 VA transformer to replace a 10 VA model that wasn't able to provide ample power to two doorbells I wired together. I needed a reliable transformer that would make both doorbells ring simultaneously in different parts of the house off the main button. The transformer was easy to install and I had it running in just a few minutes. It now powers two doorbells, one on the main floor and one in the basement. This transformer is the locknut variety and has a plastic locknut versus a metal nut which my previous transformer had. I don't think it matters much, but I thought worth mentioning.I was able to find this product through my local Ace Hardware for less than Amazon. They sold it for $9.95 and shipped it from their warehouse to the store for free."
4,Not what I expected but good just the same,My daughter and I love vampires and I thought this was short stories about the myth. They are more about the emotional vampires we encounter daily and the stories are still interesting.
2,I am a handsome man,"I am not a recent fan of this band but what really blew me away was the the action of the band head, Handsome Richard Manitoba.Why does a rock star think they own the world when they gain a modicum of star status? i am referring the legal action by the handsome man to force electronic artist, Dan Snatih to drop his recording name Mantitoba, despite the fact the handsome man never recorded any solo material.Perhaps just another example of the record label owning the band. How punk is that!Perhaps the handsome man should have changed his name to The Big D!"
1,Disappointed,"I was very underwhelmed by the results with this product. I am going to return it and try something else. I did not get any noticable, durable shine by using the 3-way buffer & solution."
5,Beautiful Watch,"This is a gorgeous watch, my girlfriend loved it! She has received lots of compliments!"
4,You want to learn...buy this video NOW!,"I've been through many selling courses, but Brian wraps them all into one. The best sales training video ever. A bit old and out-dated, but still relevent for any field. We use this to train all of our sales staff."
1,disappointed...,"I was getting ready to give my dog a bath, but after I hooked up the pet jet to the sink and turned on the water, it not only leaked, but shot water out all over. My husband is going to see if he can find a better connection to replace the cheap plastic one...I hope it works!"
2,No Thanks,It was probably a hoot sitting in the audience that was most likely high. I didn't try that so was not really impressed.
4,Magical shopping review,"The shows pretty good, animation is enjoyable, it isnt as hilarious as the back of the box would suggest but it does have its moments."
4,Publisher's Comment,"This guide and companion CD-ROM (which contains forms, templates, etc.) is an unintimidating starting point for business continuity, particularly in an IT-focused organization of any size.You don't have to be a rocket scientist or spend hundreds of hours to build a basic, functional business continuity program with this tool."
2,Glad its not just me..,"This toy was all my husband's idea and I was reluctant to let him get a 300+ corvette for a then 1 year old (2 the next day but still!) . But he bought it and my son loved it! I moved a few days later and my son still enjoyed it but with it being just me I could never move the car out of the room to let him truly enjoy riding it but it didn't matter much to him, he still liked it.The problems arose with the charger, it broke within 3 months of having it but not totally so I was able to wrap some electric tape so that the car was still able to charge. However after a while the charge couldn't hold anymore, its been nearly 3 years now and I am seriously debating on whether or not I want to just get rid of that monstrosity that takes up a good bit of my boys' playroom or if I should fix it up for my now almost 5 year old.. after coming on here i'm glad that there is really not much I couldve done to prevent what happened to the car. It really is nice looking but what a waste.."
4,Not one to tune out.,This book is in the usual Pelletier vein - strong on women characters and connects with nature. Sonny is more of prop and sometimes the motivation for his actions is a bit contrived. Even so a more than satisfying outing for Pelletier.
2,Not for Independent Learning,"While this book may be good for teachers or people who want to review previously mastered skills and techniques, it is not good for the independent learner who has no knowledge of the double bass. I purchased this book after taking up the string bass as a second instrument. I am learning on my own, since I already have a private instructor for my main instrument, piano. I was disappointed in this book, because there were not enough pictures indicating basic positions. The one page of visual clues contained in the book were poor, and the few photographs were barely discernable because of their poor resolution. If you want to learn the double bass, look for a bassist or find a better book."
3,Book full of exercise charts from the 1800's,"The book is 99.9% exercise charts. One page of demonstration pictures.Simandl was born in 1840, thus the numerous 'editions'.This is Book one of two, with many pages split down the middle into English and Japanese versions.Would have liked more demo pics, but this is auditory, not visually based, training; and besides, no one had their digital camera's just yet."
2,better books are out there....,"I just finished reading the 5th edition. I would recommend this book ONLY to those individuals who have zero concept of the airline industry or who have never taken a basic marketing course. Otherwise this book will be a tedious and boring read, exacerbated by the endless typos and horrible writing style and sentence structure. Much of what is written is commonsense and one is often left thinking ""no s**t."" For those who seek a more academic analysis or more advanced treatment of the subject, I would recommend looking at stuff by Doganis or Holloway."
2,this product is way overpriced,"i don't have much to complain about the sauce itself but with the price i paid, it absolutely comes short of my expectation. not recommend"
4,Great Import CD Single,Part of my heavy rotation mix. The Kay Cee Club Mix is ideal when going from Freestyle Music to Trance.
5,Definitely a sweet deal!,"There are crystal beads, and then there are Swarovski crystal beads. With the projects I work on, I love Swarovski crystal. And Fast & Easy had a great deal on these beads, I just could not pass up. True, as advertised, the beads are not sorted by color. You have to do that yourself. But at the price that was offered? Definitely worth a little extra effort on my part. I was pleased with the product, the quality was perfect and delivery was right on time. Would I buy from Fast & Easy again? Definitely!"
4,Almost is a winner,"This book grabbed me from the first sentence and I loved it. The story of Sophy Chase and her almost husband takes you to Swansea, her twin stepdaughters, the first wife, and the sharply written summer (versus all year round) island life. You also get the story of her almost-boyfriend and her almost status as a stepmother to 4 adopted children, with the sharpest focus on Vicky who disappears for a few days during a particularly difficult time in Sophy's life. It might sound complicated, but it works. This is great read, it may be a fast read, but Elizabeth Benedict's characters stay with you. I am so glad I found this book!"
2,Dogora will bore ya!,This ToHo movie will do what most Japanese films never do and that's bore the hell out of you. Dull Dull Dull. An alien that eats diamonds shows up and mucks up diamond robbers. Too much diamond robber stuff too little monster.
4,English-set mystery with supernatural overtones,"Davies' writing style is pleasant and this is an easy read.The plot revolves around a David Conway, a young industrial consultant who is drawn into a mystery by a former client. The client's household has been experiencing some ghostly phenomena, and David is brought in to debunk the whole thing. But as he gets deeper into the haunting and its reason, David isn't so sure there is anything to debunk. But there is an obvious living villain at work also, as the deaths of people involved in the case start to mount.Written in the 1960's, the book fits the mold of the Golden Age mystery, and is worth seeking out, with a nice twist at the end that sort of explains a lot of things I was puzzled about when I decided who was behind the dastardly goings-on."
1,Doesn't work with Jornada 568!,"I know I should have paid more attention but not thinking and based off of someone's Jornada listmania list I bought this card on ebay. Needless to say the Jornada 568 only works with TypeI and TypeI extended. But not Type II's like this one. I'm sure that this is a great wireless CF card, but not if you own a Jornada!"
3,Works ok for short range,"I have a complete Linksys wireless setup networking 4 computers at home and love it. So, of course when I picked up my new PDA (the awesome Sharp Zaurus SL-5000D -- consumer version is SL-5500) I went straight [...here]and looked for a Linksys CF card to get my PDA wirelessly connected. Installation and configuration went fine, as I've come to expect, but when I attempt to use it in spots where my Linksys PCMCIA cards get 11Mbs, I get nothing! I would at least expect a drop off in connection speed, but no such luck. Wireless is not much good if you can't take your device where you want to surf from.Also, if you happen to be getting this for the Sharp PDA I mentioned, be warned that the T-shaped end of the card blocks the stylus, so you have to remember to remove the stylus before you power on the PDA. Very annoying. I'm going to return it and look at a Socket brand instead. Sorry Linksys."
5,A Seminal Work,"The obscure international relations world of international organizations and countries is generally visible and comprehensible to academics and human rights activists, but Anaya has written a seminal work in this area that provides sufficient background for readers to understand the relationship between indigenous peoples and human rights. This is extremely important reading for environmental activists interested in preserving the rainforest, defending sensitive environmental homelands of tribal peoples or understanding the question of access to international fora.Anaya provides a legal background for the domination of the Western hemisphere by whites and shows how thin it really is.But the really great thing about this book is that it shows what the state of indigenous people in international bodies is and how it is harnessed by human rights and environmental groups."
4,great movie,"A very emotive movie great thriller it will open your eyes to how amazingly screwed up some people are. I mean, really, really screwed up in a monumental fashion."
4,Could be a cult classic,"These are songs, in Southern Italian dialect, as akin to Spanish or Portuguese as to official (Tuscan) Italian -- about the Mafia (Sicily), Camorra (Naples), and Ndrangheta (Calabria), each a variant type of secret society, almost a parallel government in some cases.Much of the music and especially the lyrics, are quite interesting, if old-fashioned, especially ""Ndrangheta, Camorra e Mafia"" and ""Omerta.""This is not the music of Tony Soprano, but perhaps of his third cousins in the Old Country."
5,It is what you would expect from a language reference,This book is a compilation of various functions and commands available to the VisualBasic 5 environment. It provides examples and supplimental information to help users with different levels of expertise.Recommended if you want to really program in VB 5.0.
1,Not what I ordered!!!,"This is a low quality bed. It is basically just an oversized pillow. Also, it looks nothing like the picture. The one I got was black (not red)."
3,"Wasnt expensive, but expected more",My dog loved it at first! But after using it for 2 weeks it lost its shape and I have to continually fluff it up or the dog is laying on the floor. Maybe my expectations were too high.
5,I thought this was silly until I bought one,There is hardly a jar this won't open and easily. I have arthritis in my hands and used to ask my husband to open everything. Now I just put it in this jar opener and in seconds the jar is open. No jar is too tough.Black & Decker JW400 Lids Off Open-It-All Center
4,"Wow, this thing works","When I first started looking for a car ionizer, I read reviews of some that said they didn't work. I decided to take a chance on this one because the price was so low, I could just toss it if it did nothing. Let me tell you, this this thing works, and then some. Within seconds of plugging it in I could smell the ozone. The smell was so strong that I actually had to crack the window open, which is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5, it actually works too well!! It is very well designed, it rotates around to fit in just about any position, has an extra socket so you can plug in your cell phone, and has a really cool looking blue power light."
2,"Save your money, buy the Broadway Cast recording","The only thing on the London recording that approaches the Broadway Cast album is Chita Rivera's performance as Rosie, which is also ON the Broadway version. Peter Marshall makes the character of Albert Peterson sound like a Jerry Lewis creation and Sylvia Tysick as Kim DOES sound like a teenager- one who can't sing. The kids on this album generally are awful. They screech instead of sing and many of them have pronounced accents. A lot of the singing is out of tune and the orchestra hits clams frequently. This album was recorded in an era where British versions of American musicals were frequently inferior vocally to their U.S. counterparts. Thankfully, that has changed. London has proven to be a haven for many discarded American musicals that deserve revivals here, but for financial reasons will probably never see the light of day. Perhaps someone in England will revive ""Birdie"" and produce a recording that does this underrated show true justice."
4,A classic,"Most enjoyable selection of songs, done in his own inimitable way. Can't top his renditions of ""Scarlet Ribbons"" and Mary's Boy Child."
5,Jazz poems,"Hummer is one of my favorite poets, and this book is distinct and powerful. It's a suite of poems, based on jazz and blues musicians, but it also tells the cultural history of the country--especially from the 40s through the 70s--through the lives of those musicians, who were tortured, sometimes, troubled, but also visionary. The section ""about"" Sun Ra is especially powerful. Are you sick of smartaleck poetry, or unreadable oblique verse, or unpeopled deconstructions of, well, whatever? Me too. Read Hummer. He's the real thing."
2,Swiss Rail Journeys,"This video is really miss titled. It does not contain very much footage of the Swiss railways. It contains more footage of boat cruises around various Swiss lakes than railways. It is still worth the price and is interesting, but not what I was expecting."
2,Nice music to my ears!,"Another good ""O'Jays"" album.But no more than this.Best tunes:'Let's ride' and 'Long distance lover'"
4,Good Album,now this Album has Solid Moments here.these Brothers haven't Lost a thing Vocally.they have the vibe&timing.they could teach many acts times over how it's suppose to be done.the smoothness&directness hasn't left them.this is there Best album in years.I Wish The Isley Brothers had Have Listened to this Album before they dropped this Album.Sure you might not sell as many Albums&whatnot but you stay true to Yourself&Groove.I dig the Isley's Alot but the O'jays stayed true&it shows.Very Good Album.
4,Pet lover,This book is cute. It has some good projects. More good ideas. I wouldn't say I love it but I do like it.
3,"OK, but","If you purchase this system, be prepared to also buy a powered sub if you want any sort of decent bass reponse. This system is ok for a bedroom, or if sound quality is not important."
4,Wanted Dead or Alive,"Wanted Dead or Alive staring Rutger Hauer as a bounty hunter and Gene Simmons as a Terrorist on the loose in Los Angeles. While it was your standard blow up shootem up action movie, it has a decent storyline and likeable characters. Well acted and a little more serious than Lethal Weapon, this is definately a movie worth taking home."
1,"Excuse me, why is she singing about Christianity when she doesn't even believe it?","There is something terribly wrong with singing songs about the birth of the Son of God and making money off it, then turning around and condemning Christiianity and Christians.I get her criticism, sometimes Christians behave in the worst ways, but I can't believe she has the audacity to sing song about CHRISTmas and make money off it.Something wrong with this picture."
1,A waste of paper,I can't believe someone got paid to write this tripe material. What so quick about this stuff? You have to be clueless in the sex department or just discovered viagra after a thirty year dry spell to get anything out of this book. Save your money.
3,Definately different,"I bought this book on a whim. I'd never heard of Laura Corn, or any other of her books. The book just intrigued me from the star. I couldn't imagine leaving the bookstore with out it, so I brought it home. At first it was extremely fun, and my fiancee and I grew closer than ever, but after a while we grew bored with it. Some of the coupons required things we didn't have or couldn't do. Some of them required things we just flat out wouldn't do. So we just gave it up and went back to our own experiamenting. The book was a great idea, and was fun for a while, but it just lost it's 'flair' after a while. Maybe next time....."
5,Buy it...,"Buy this book. If you're married and things have gotten a little slower, this will speed it up and add some MAJOR spice to your marriage."
3,Dmutro Mural,"Everything is great about this item except two major features: focus and recording in the highest quality which Sony was proud of, announcing this camcorder. So, auto focus works terribly and it is not only quick off focus moment during recording - when it goes unfocused it will take it up to 8-10 seconds to bring itself back too focus. And the main DISSAPOINTMENT is it just does NOT record more then 2-3 minutes of highest quality (15 Mbps), because of ""buffer overflow"" followed with ""data error - these are messages you will get trying to record this type video. But Sony Support says is just because I have been using Memory Stick Pro Duo MagicGate, I was not supposed to be using 'MagicGate' one, but on their official site MagicGate Memory Stick is all over accessories to this camcorder and it is everywhere on the pictures. So this is complete FIASCO of THE FIRST MEMORY STICK HD-CAMCORDER."
3,"great camcorder, but...","great pictures.narrow latitude. it's almost impossible to keep correctly exposed both highlights and shadows under the sunshine. but still excellent for the price.the slow motion features really attracted me, but it turned out to be unusable. image quality is really poor and a sharp focus is impossible. if you count on this feature, just forget this camera.too bad there's not a progressive mode, but still, deinterlacing the clips is a viable options and the quality remains great.if you don't use a mac for editing, avchd is a long long journey through codecs and format translations. i use cineform and it's ok."
2,Beware - Blurry video problem -,"Update - I now get period blurry video so I can not longer rely on this camcorder. I am having to by a new one WAY TOO SOON. Not happy now at all. Sony support was not helpful at all.Video quality is great. Easy to use. 3 Watt accessory light works well but needs a diffuser. Battery life is good. I used 8gb memory sticks and got about an hour out of each on best quality. Small, light and simple. Suggest an after market hdmi to mini hdmi for convenient playack from hdtv. I was able to put the memory stick into my ps3 and played the movies in seconds! Chose over the canon hg10."
5,Good History and Artwork,If you are the kind of person like I am you will like this book. It has all kind of harldes to help you to ID you favorit knight. I make my own toy soldiers and thid is a great resouce book. Buy this one fast.
4,New Orleans we love you,"Let me first say that this is a wonderful book, with wonderful photographs and interesting text, the books images really capture the Quarter, they are quite vivid and well thought out, more beautiful historic buildings at every turn of the page and thank God it was spared the wrath of Katrina, but this review is about the Cresent City. As an American, I am disgraced at the nations response to your plight, I will, personally donate my time and money to make this up to you, you are one of the great American cities and a national treasure, you will rebound, we Americans, particularly Southerners, like myself, will never allow you to sink into the Mississippi, we love you New Orleans and with our sweat and tears we will help you rebuild, no matter the cost, you will reserect like a phoenix, and I will be the one of the first to visit and celebrate your reemergence as one of the premier American cities, God Speed New Orleans."
3,Standard Fare,"A collection of mostly uninteresting poems by the author of the Alice stories. Phantasmagoria, the longest piece, details the conversation between a ghost and the man whose house, it seems, he has been ""assigned"" to haunt. It's a well-written poem, but boring -- the action obviously being discomfited by the author's efforts to remain true to the rhyme scheme. The rest of the work is along the same lines -- technically masterful, but not very enjoyable reads. The exceptions are a couple wonderful little ballads towards the end of the book. But if you are looking for more gems from the mind who created ""Jabberwocky,"" (as I was), you won't find it here."
4,Good movie,"This is a good movie. It brings a lot of happiness and tears. Three years ago, I watched the first series of this movie. This again, doesn't bring disappointment at all. It is a fully well-done movie. For the story, it is very touchy. For the acting, they are better than the first one especially for America Ferrera as Carmen. For the direction, it is all making sense and good. Finally, the visuals are good as well. Overall, great movie and I enjoyed it."
2,Read The Books,"I was a disappointed in this movie. I read all 4 books before this movie came out. It takes the last 3 books and cuts them apart to place into a 2 hour movie. Yes, the movie was ok, but if you want the full show I would strongly suggest reading the books."
4,widescreen,While I love the movie I just spent several hours being suprised by the a-typical letterboxing of the movie. While it is widescreen it is more like the letterboxing they put on certain tv shows as viewed on television. I would have rather had a more noticable widescreen representation. It's a beautiful movie but the sweeping views have a good chance of being cut out when you don't get the full picture you saw in the movie theatre.
1,Downgrade...,The 2nd movie was very shallow. I was very disappointed to have to turn around and sell yet another movie I just bought.
3,shipping jeans with archeological dirt... gross,"A chick flick in the second generation ( most die a graceless death the first time!) has the girls at their lives and loves again.The acting is pretty good; I like the stage hand better than the beautiful Greek artist, but they all have their growing pains.Who will be the first to get married?The first to have a baby or the first to die?Life has surprises for them all.I can't see guys sharing a pair of levis."
4,Great Chick Flick,Sisterhood stories are the antithesis of Sex and the City. Youth and their coming of age bonds them. Both women rock but in a different way. An NYC backdrop vs suburbia. Love this flick and recommend it for a pj party and chick flick night.
4,"WOW, A fresh Van Damne movie that is good","Van Damne delivers a great new movie, thank god, because if he did another bad movie, and see and hear bad comments, he will prolly call it quits but no he still got it.I expected a little more from this movie, like he did fight, but no fancy kicking just punching, but the movie was still good."
1,Van Damme is washed up.,"All of Van Damme's latest movies seem to be weak, and this is just another one with weak storyline and fights. I used to be a big fan of this guy back in the early 90's cause of movies like Blood Sport, Kickboxer, Lion Heart, and Double Impact. Those were some good flicks by him at the time. I was a little kid and I used to watch Kickboxer, and Bloodsport all the time, and I thought he was the coolest. Now he's just all washed up. His fighting scenes are boring, and he doesn't have the intensity anymore like he used to. His career seems like it's about to be over or something. His movies are just played out to me, cause I've been more of a Hong Kong action fan."
3,Not our favorite!,"We have enjoyed all the other Little People toys, this one has not been as nice. This boat will only stay afloat if it is not touched. Our boat has been out in the sun by the pool and the colors have faded badly! This is the first time I've seen damage on a Fisher-Price toy. My low rating in the education section is due to the fact that it sinks so easily."
5,Skunked Again,"The first time my two dogs were ""skunked"" I tried every home remedy that the country folk around here could come up with. Nothing worked, just time and it took months for the smell to disappear. I immediately got on the internet and found Skunk Off which I've had put away for at least a year without using. Last night my girls got skunked AGAIN! I remembered that I bought the Skunk Off and of course, all the men in the family said it most likely wouldn't work at all. I put it on and within, literally, minutes, I was able to let the dogs in the house. The directions say you must get every area that has the smell and they're right. It eliminates only those areas you spray. I got a 3.24 oz. bottle, I'm buying the big one this time."
4,Best thing we've found yet,"We tried every home remedy and even a concoction from the vet to get the skunk smell off of our dog. He has been ""skunked"" twice recently. Skunk Off works better than anything else. After using the product, we were able to let the dog in the house. Maybe we should just train the dog to stay away from the skunks! Got any products for that? Ha"
4,"The Legend of Drizzt, volune 2",I really liked the story line. But it should be explained that it is written in comic book form. Not exactly adult reading material.
1,This is a comic book.,"If you are looking for the novel, this isn't it. The description does not indicate that this is nothing more than a fancy comic book. I bought vol 1-3, returned all with a complaint, Amazon reordered for me and sent me the same thing again. Finally got the novels from B&N for less. Don't waste your money."
4,A Useful Product!,"Not much to say other than it works pretty much as expected. The ink is virtually invisible on many surfaces until the UV light illuminates it. The only trouble I ran into was with the light flickering on and off. After taking it apart, it turned out the spring was just a little too short to keep the batteries touching. I stretched it out a bit, put it back together and it works perfectly now."
5,Excellent set,"Worked very well, and i dont even play clarinet as my main instrument. I highly reccoment Vandoren to all players, rarely has a bad reed ever shown up for me."
3,Works well... for awhile.,"I bought this Jabra headset to replace my old Nokia one, which had ceased to work. I enjoyed the Jabra's over-the-ear design, which was more functional and comfortable than the typical earbud. Also, for the most part, the sound quality was quite good. Then, for no reason, one day it suddenly stopped working. (Oddly enough, the person on the other end could still hear me, but I could no longer hear him. My Jabra had gone deaf.) I'd always stored my headset carefully, making great effort never to coil the wire too tightly, or let it be stepped on or otherwise harmed. I have no idea why it decided to malfunction -- but it did. So beware: This is a great headset, until it mysteriously and abruptly broke.Beware"
1,overpriced,"I had to give it one star because you wouldn't take it without -- but this isn't about the product -- it's about your PRICE OF $2488 for 17oz!There must be some mistake. Even from La Mer itself, the 16.5 oz is only $1350! So how can you ask that much MORE for an extra 1/2 oz? And if you get the 2 oz from them, it's the same price as yours, but at least it's NOT *NIB*"
4,An Aussie Gem,I was surprised to see no review. This is a great book for beginning Folk Artists written by Australian kate Coombe. It has some really good fruit projects and step by step worksheets throughout. There are a coupl of nice sheep piece here too. The designs have a real country feel about them. It is a wonderful book to add to your painting library.
4,Excellent architecture perspective,"This book offers an excellent comparison of BW functions and capabilities against a data warehouse architecture envisioned by Bill Inmon. There might be 2 or 3 ways to build a business solution and this book is good at recommending one if not ""the best"".On the other hand, this book is useless if you are planning to seat in front of the terminal and begin using BW. A good book that could complement this one is ""SAP BW A Step-by-Step Guide""."
3,"interesting, but under-handed","An overview of Laing's ideas and detailed examination of his critics views including Thomas Szasz. Quite interesting, but Kotowicz, it turns out, seems to be taking Szasz out of context in a way that sounds very under-handed."
2,Too much cheese!,"I was disappointed in this production. While it had all of the elments needed for a good video, even some humor, it lacked in performance. It was over-acted and cheesy!!! I was hoping for something fun, uplifting, and decently performed. Veggie Tales beats this by a long shot! Turn down the cheese factor and put more solid acting and you might have a decent film."
5,"100 superb, dynamic photographs of Labrador Retrievers","100 superb, dynamic photographs of Labrador Retrievers highlight Mike Singer's What Labs Love, an excellent book for dog aficionados. This always reliable dog breed is showcased physically and emotionally in a heartwarming, enjoyable celebration. Especially recommended for Lab owners, or for folks who just plain love Labs, What Labs Love is for anyone who delights in the unconditional love and adoration of a family canine."
2,A Disappointment,"This CD single arrived in my mailbox about a week ago. I have yet to even listen to it. A slightly more recent Elvis Costello release, titled 'Cruel Smile', contains all the b-sides on this single."
3,littlechickencook,"this type of item is not very durable, as are most of the doll clothes that you buy."
2,i give up,"I'm a good reader, love American history, and a native Californian, so I thought I'd love this book. I can't get enough of western history, but I had a real hard time reading this one, and finally gave up after a couple of chapters. The run-on sentences left me wondering what I'd just read, and I found myself reading the same sentences over and over. By the time I finished a paragraph, I was wondering what I'd just read."
4,Excellent!,"I loved Rutherfurd's Sarum so I knew I would enjoy, ""The Princes of Ireland"" and ""The Rebels of Ireland."" I prefer Rebels over Princes. Rutherford had to cram 1,000 years of history into Princes so some of the character depth is lost. The focus is on the history. In Rebels, history and the characters are well-balanced. Both novels are well written and worth the hard back price."
2,Not My Historical Cup of Tea,"Tripe. The Michener approach to historical fiction worked well enough in the first installment, The Princes of Ireland. The misty past, lacking historic record, is fertile ground for mythic fiction.This weighty tome (862 pages) exposes the flaws in attempting to personalize complex cultural, economic, religious, and political conflicts into a broad, sweeping panorama that lacks depth. The shallow plot attempts to mitigate centuries of sadistic oppression and trivialize pain, suffering, and death. It fails.The Georgian Dublin of the Anglo-Irish is pictured as a magical place with grand buildings and peopled by Ascendancy scholars, artists, and aristocrats. Other than the dangers of being mugged, little mention is made of the sorry lot of the majority of the city's inhabitants. Dublin was a disease infested hell-hole for most of the city dwellers at the dawn of the 20th century.Historical fiction can educate and enlighten. This book does neither."
5,Very intense,"This movie is very intense to watch. I orginally got this movie was to see what all of the ""hipe"" was about when it was released. I am very glad that I did purchase it because it was one of the first movies to come out that didn't revolve around the AIDS issue. When you are gay, you don't have to hear about it everywhere you turn. It becomes part of our lives."
3,Michael Jackson: The Ultimate Collection,"Bought this for my husband for father's day. He liked it, but it did not have all his hit songs on it. I love Michael's music. I wanted to hear ""In the Closet"", but it is not on here. I did not care too much for the live concert, it was okay. He is not very exciting anymore. His sister has better moves, he needs to change up. He will always be a lengend though. They should re-name the title-- it is not ultimate."
5,One of the cornerstones of Pop Music,"He is One of the Most Important Artists Ever. he is the King of Pop.as a Writer,Producer,Vocalist,Entertainer this soul brother Forever changed the game,first as part of the Jackson 5&then later as a Solo Artist.Ground-Breaker on so many levels. still so Emulated after all of these years.Michael Jackson is a Musical Genius. this Box set captures His Motown years through His Sony Years. no matter what the style or sound of the day Michael Jackson could always hang. this Box set contains some of the Greatest songs Ever Recorded in the History of Pop music. this Man has done it all Musically."
3,It's great,"I buy this for a gift, my girlfriend is a Michael Jackson's fan, i make this gift on his birtday.She told me that the CD is spectacular because it has the best songs and songs for her unknown"
2,wheres the box set?,ordered june 26th...no email..no apology..no nothing..order was pushed back to the first week in august..if they didnt have anymore just say so..the truth doesnt hurt..never again
2,Ultimate collection???,"Think this collection is pretty lousy. Most of the songs seem to be ones I've never heard of. While they aren't gosh darn awful, they're mediocre at best. I wouldn't have bought this if I had known."
5,Buy this,"This is a great set, if you have purchased all of MJs other albums this is a little overkill but I believe this is a great buy in its own right."
2,Give Amazon a Break,I am compelled to respond to all the customers complaining about the handling of the backorders of this collection. I ordered it on June 29th.$34.99 and Amazon has sent me at least four updates about the delay. I am sure they sold out right after MJ died and MJ & co. are making new ones to fullfill all the backorders. I ordered from Amazon three MJ videos to hold me over. Give Amazon a break! You will get them soon. I will give five stars when I receive it.
1,Not Shipped Yet?,"Order Date: July 7th, not yet shipped. Where is my order??? Expected this at least a week ago. Very disappointed. Would at least like a note from Amazon saying they are on Back Order?"
5,King of Pop Lives On,This collection is trully a tribute to the King of Pop.I was so happy I was able to purchase this the day he died. I would have regretted not owning this collection.
3,Ehh..I want more.,The writing and the stories of this book is great. But after reading everything it leaves you to wonder and want to know more of what happened to the Caps-. It needs to be more elaborate. Its a ok book to start a Cappadocian character.
3,One of several...,"Good for background info, like all the clanbooks. Don't feel like writing a huge review, the Cappadocians aren't exactly on the top of my list of favorite things to play."
5,A must have for fans,If you enjoy Pink Floyd you should definitely look into getting this book. It will help you better understand the band and their music. Pink Floyd is a very interesting band and this book really doesn't get boring. Schaffner has done his research and gathered quotes from anyone significant to the band. You will not regret buying this book.
1,Buyer Beware Lexmark Review,"I am afraid to buy another Lexmark. This is what my melted z515 looks like now, less than one year after purchase: http://www.thebradleyzone.com/lexmarkz515.jpg"
4,Controversy Sells,"Paul and Koopa both rip it up on they raps. Great job from both of em. Dude from their old record label talkin is annoying as hell. Neither of these two geniuses are signed to the label that put this cd out anymore and they have both moved on to bigger and better things apart from each other. This cd is basically raps from the two of them mashed together and thrown over some beats to make a short cd. There is no chemistry between paul and cham like there is on GET YA MIND CORRECT, which by the way is a CLASSIC, go buy it. There are some catchy beats on here though and their lyrics are tight as hell so grab this cd if ya see it. TRUE, Still, and House of Pain, are my top 3 songs from this cd."
1,Please Dont Press Purchase,"Listen..... You hear it?????? Thats the sound of a horrible record.. Dont get me wrong Koopa is the King but this album which I will admitt to bootlegging cause it doesent deserve a half a penny... Folks this album is worse than Milli Vanillis greatest hits.. Its thrown together with half verses from Chamillionaire and half verses from Paul Wall.. The only good songs are jacked... You can purchase these good songs in the ""REAL"" by getting Chamillitary and Mixtape Messiah... Mad Hatta and Big Cat are lames and I cant believe they realesed this phoney album... Paid in Partial records is all garbage and this album should be removed from this web site immediatly.. Any real Chamillionaire fan should be digusted by this Album which has no respect for The Game... This is as fake as Lil Kims breasts and face... I personally would rather listen to a Elton John album before i Bump This Garbage....... Dyke Jones Phoney"
1,Steam Iron Won't Steam,"I have read and re-read the instructions for this iron and I can't get it to steam continuously which is what I have always been accustomed to with a STEAM iron.They know it has problems because the instructions tell you &quot;if the temperature setting and steam control setting are correct and there is no steam, gently tap the soleplate on the ironing board a few times. Move the variable steam control from '0' to 'Max' a few times.&quot;After this the iron will steam for a few seconds and then it stops again. Not a good steam iron."
1,Waste of Money,"Quite simply, the iron is terrible. Although mine heats, the steam function consists of a dribble of water that pools on the clothes. Having the on/off switch right where your hand rests is also silly since it becomes quite easy to accidentally turn the iron off. This is as bad of an iron as I have encountered, so save yourself some grief and get a different brand."
3,one year iron,"these last about a year and then stop working...they are the best while they are working. but, imagine this...i bought it november 2010 and it just quit working december 2011. 1 year warranty is up."
2,Rush to Market,"Here's another example of a great company getting greedy, rushing into the consumer market without, ahem, ironing out major design flaws. This iron could have been a blue-ribbon winner, were it not for a steam feature that kicked over and died within one month of using the iron. When the steam feature did work, this was one honey of an iron. But one month out and the steam feature is dead. Which makes this one clunker of an iron. Shame on you Euro-Pro. Here I was hoping you were going to build on your reputation for designing fantastic industrial irons, but your move from the industrial to the consumer market is not doing your brand any favor. I'll certainly think more than twice before considering anything by Euro-Pro in the future. Oh, and another thing: some warranty service: you have to PAY the company to have them ship the iron back to you once (presumably) repaired. Their flaw, my cost... By anyone's math, that adds up to a BIG ZERO!"
2,No long life here,"I purchased my GI 490 18 months ago at Bed Bath and Beyond. At the time, I spoke to a Male Butler that was buying the same Iron. He raved about it.While looking for a new Iron that will last, I came upon these reviews. I will not buy another Shark. I loved it till it quit. Now no steam, and only a low heat on any setting. So I will return to the store that replaces anything that you are not satisified with. Even beyond the warranty. I am willing to pay more to get a iron that will go the distance. I would hope for 4 years. I only Iron about every 10 to 14 days. That goal seems reasonable to me. To it's credit, the iron did not leak. I drained it after each use as recommended. I actually used bottled water since I iron so infrequently. So, on to the next.Mike"
1,This is a 1600 watt iron!,"The product description on Amazon describes this iron as a 1700 watt model. It is actually a 1600 watt model, significantly weaker, as irons go. We took the iron out of the box to confirm the wattage on its label, but otherwise didn't use it. Sending it back today.So, this may be an OK iron, but it's not what is advertised!"
1,defective,stopped working after a couple months. iron heats up but will not produce steam. RMA policy requires customer to pay for shipping of replacement iron. needless to say i will not be getting another shark.
1,Stay Away from this Iron!,"I bought this Shark because of the advertised 1700 watts, and the overall impressive look of the box. Whoever designed that really knows how to advertise. However, I ironed with this maybe 2 or 3 times before it stopped working. To be fair, it did fall off the ironing board and onto the carpet, but plenty of irons have met this fate before and kept going. Since I dropped it, I don't feel that I can return it to Target, and am out the $60 or so that it cost. Instead of paying to fix what might just break again, I'm getting a Black and Decker 2030."
2,Great product if you can get a good one.,"I purchased one of these after using my mom's iron. She's had hers for nearly 2 years. The steam output by this iron is amazing. The 10-foot power cord makes life much easier. It's thumb-operated temperature button is a nice touch. Just about everything about this iron is great--if you get a good working copy...Sadly, I didn't get a good one. After just 2 days, the steam mysteriously stopped emitting from the lower vents. It also started to leak. I think that Euro-Pro needs to take a good hard look at their quality assurance. I returned it and will purchase another brand. I don't recommend anyone buying this until they fix the QA issue."
1,My Iron Died after Only a Year and a Half.,"After a year and a half, the electronics on this iron stopped working. It simply would not turn on. Shark installed substandard electronic parts in this product."
1,great until it dies!!,Did not read the reviews until after I bought this iron. Worked great for about 3 months and then just DIED! Won't even turn on. Don't waste your money!!!
4,Great iron,I have tried all brands of irons. I use to think in order to get a good iron you had to spend $80.00-$100.00. I went through three Rowentas in no time. They are overpriced German junk. The Shark has been great. The steam blast out of the iron which makes ironing a shirt effortless. About the only thing I would chnge would be the on/off button. It is easy to hit due to it's position on the handle. Other than this that this is a great value.
2,"Provides 1 year of good ironing, then dies","I've bought two of these Shark euro-pro irons, each model year newer than the other and I had high hopes for this iron. It makes great steam, it's heavy and very well balanced and it lasts for 1 year only. I used this iron every day. I thought when it happened to the first iron I bought, that it was a fluke but when the 2nd iron I bought broke after 1 year I know it's this iron. The iron makes great steam but it breaks completely after one year. This latest iron burned a hole in my slacks and I didn't even know it was touching my pants. Who ever makes this Shark iron needs to work on Quality control. A good iron should last at least 3 years in my opinion."
3,Bummer!,Great remixes that are too short!Track Listings1. Could I Have This Kiss Forever (Metro Mix - 3:57)2. I'm Your Baby Tonight (Dronez Mix - 5:04)3. I'm Every Woman (Clivilles & Cole Mix - 4:32)4. Queen Of The Night (CJ Mackintosh Mix - 3:48)
4,A great book,This was a bit old for my 4.5 year old however she has the reading comprehension of a 6/7 year old. This book is an excellent product and we enjoyed it. It would be ideal for a 8-13 year olds. Great addition to our Celiac library.
3,Tuli Insoles,"Not as shock absorbing as they were portrayed to be, however they may be okay for others. Have not given up on them."
5,Best record of 2003,"Best record of the year, hands down. Bob is king. Long live Bob. Also, see them when they hit your town."
4,"Mediocre Bob is better than 99 % of commercial ""music""","Had to respond to the seemingly increasing rift between old school and new school GBV fans. Hey cant we all just get along? Ill venture to bet that any GBV fan be it old or new has WAAAAAAAAAY more in common with one another than the average man on the street that either one may come in contact with. So quit squabling and embrace your ""Bobness"". As for this here cd...its ok for GBV standards. Its not as good as UTAC but better than Do The Collapse. Its about like Isolation Drills in terms of quality and flow. Those of you still waiting for Bee Thousand II, get over it. Those days are over, we can cherish them but we must let them go. Those of you that PREFER the new GBV over the Tobin Sprout era need to get a clue. So in closing, this is better than 99% of the BS out there but it is not and there will never be a period like mid90's GBV again."
3,Pure Pop For Then People,"Pollard's been listening to later Who and early Genesis records again. The band sounds disappointingly competent at times. (I prefer sloppy and unpredictable.)There's one bona-fide barn burner (""The Best of Jill Hives"") that's as good as anything they've done.It will take some time to grow on me, I'm sure. New fans might wonder what all the fuss is about, as it doesn't sound - to my jaded fan's ears - like any new ground has been broken.But even a so-so GbV disc is light years better than 97% of the bilge on the radio, so shut up and buy it, already."
3,way to go boys,"the cd is mostly catchy songs that have a bright rock guitar sound. it is not lo-fi but rather hi-fi. all of the songs are whole songs, not just fragments like many of pollard's ""songs"". i think he could be writing commercial jingles if he didn't have any integrity. anyway, you should buy it if you like to listen to some guy from ohio sing like he's from liverpool. the opening song has a guitar solo that sounds like sonic youth. none of these songs are really that melodically breathtaking. i mean to say that there are plenty of hummable melodies and hooks but none of them are really expansive. the song ""the best of jill hives"" sounds like pollard tried to rewrite one of his best anthems ""official ironman rally song"" . i give them credit? for making an album that is consistenty mediocre. average for these guys is still way better than the best that most other contemporary rock bands can do."
3,Pretty Good... Could be better,"Ok so this anime is alright, being pretty straight-forward and easy to follow. Normally with these types of anime, it walks a thin line between anime and hentai and at points the line blures to a point that it should just go full on hentai but doesn't. That said the first few seasons are great when all you want is a good fight between chicks like Hakafu and Kan-u. Recently I lost the bulk of my anime collection and have begun rebuilding it. Ikki Tousen, Dragon Destiny and Great Guardians are on the list and i do recommend these series but don't expect the greatest anime ever. it's just ok. beyond that i wouldn't bother because is pulls a little too far away from fighting for my taste"
4,Great CD,"This CD sounds awesome from the first listen, and grows on you from there. Some songs sound like they came straight off of Low Life, and others sound like they've been listening to The Bravery. If you're thinking about it, buy it...you'll love it."
2,A Little Sad,"I am an old New Order fan and I found this CD to be a disapointment. It used to be I would get a New Order CD, pop it in and be instantly transported. This album is sadly lacking and seems so pedestrain. It seems like New order is trying to sound like the other groups who have tried sounding like them. The songs sound like they are on the verge of becoming adult contemporary and when New Order tries to sound like the way they once did; it is sad."
4,They can do no wrong.,"Can you really judge a band that has a fan base older than most of us!? No! We are totally at their mercy, and we will listen to whatever they put out! Why, because they are NEW ORDER!! So I say sit back and enjoy, because it wont be disappointing."
4,A nice return to form,I do agree with the reviews that say this is not as innovative as Get Ready but then again I listen to this more than Get Ready. If you're a New Order fan then you should give this a listen. As a fan I go all the way back to Joy Division and I give this 4 stars! Krafty is a stand out.
5,Brilliant! Completely brilliant!,"Season Two starts off slow, but picks up speed starting with the third episode. Then it turns out the slow portion was in fact, highly detailed setup and foreshadowing that reaches clear back into the last couple episodes of Season One.Most of Season Two is taken up with a powerful lesson in how commodities markets work. Whoever wrote this series has worked in the commodities market and understands their flucuations in exquisite detail.Strong characters, detailed plot with solid real-world foundation, beautiful artwork. ""Spice and Wolf"" is more than great anime. It is great literature."
5,great,"I would always see deer & I hit a deer in my van before purchasing these. Since putting these on my van, I have not seen any deer, so I guess it is doing its job."
1,The Truth About Whistles,"I had these on my 2009 Toyota Venza driving at Rockland NY around 4:30am on my way to work and hit a deer. Two of them actually crossed the road, the first one made it to the other side but the second one hit my left fender. I was driving about 45-50 mph, way above the 35 mph claimed operational speed. My four month old Venza spent 2.5 weeks at the body shop, it looked like new after it was repaired but my emotional experience will never be the same. Save your money, now I'm doing research on ultrasonic deer alert devices. I recently ordered the Hopkins (now Hoppy) Trailblazer 12 volt device - will test it and do another review.This is my personal experience - IT DOESN'T WORK. If you want to take your 30% chance of avoiding a collision with a deer (based on research) then go get these. When my Venza was being repaired in the body shop, ironically the whistles were still mounted. With the technology available today, these whistles are a joke."
4,It works,"Surprisingly, this device works. I drove my Corvette in the Hill Country of Texas for years, and never had a problem.Most everyone here hits a deer sooner or later.It is my understanding the DPS (state police) use them."
1,Very disappointed!!!!!,"I purchased this iron 6 months ago and have had nothing but problems with it! First, the retractable cord won't ""retract"" and it leaks terribly all over my son's ""dry clean only"" police uniforms! There is also a rust build up that I can't get rid of. I have attempted to contact the company but have had no success. As far as I can tell, Rowenta doesn't make it easy to report complaints or get repairs. I loved the iron when I first purchaased it but now I am considering getting another."
2,This book is for a beginner,"If you are a dba with I would say less than 1-2 years experience, then maybe get this book. For a seasoned dba, its going to be a big disappointment. I was expecting explanations at a much more granular level covering much more complex topics. Its basically a primer on how to do the most basic things via the gui (oh, and by the way there is a stored procedure way to do things too). If you are new to SQL Server EM and are unfamiliar with the menus, wizards, and the gui, then it might be a good ""get me out of the frying pan quickly"" book. And I say ""might"" because most people can figure things out just by going through the gui and looking at Books Online. The most useful chapter, I found, was the auditing chapter. Some things the authors point out about security I would actually disagree with if I was building a ""highly"" secure system. For example, which accounts to put in the admins group. For what its worth, I got a lot more from the MS site believe it or not."
2,It worked o. k.,Give me the metal ones anyday. You can use them year to year. These blew in the wind and did not attract the beetles.
3,Cool Book,This is a book almost 16 year old Cassie she has never had a boyfriend or ever been on a real date. So when she gets her first boyfriend will it be as great as it seems to be? or just a drag? buy this book and find out or get it at ur local library.
1,"Great albums, poor sound","These albums from Columbia Records came out in the middle 70's. I always liked Ian Matthews' voice from the first time I heard it on his Fairport Convention work. The albums themsleves represent some rather refined singing and quite lovely songs. It's a pity the sound on this disc is so bad.The mastering on these albums is, unfortunately, unacceptable. The sound is horrid. It's harsh and unfocused. There is no bass whatsoever, and the upper midrange is screechingly over-emphasized. The sound of the cymbals is also horrible.I have many other CDs from albums that are as old or older, and the sound is just fine. There is something wrong with the master.Not recommended."
4,"Protects against casual theft, not a determined crook","I purchased this in order to protect a laptop in a shared (cubicle) office environment, where clients are also seen. Due to the thinness of the cable, I would not recommend using this lock in a high-risk situation; the cable is (or appears to be, I haven't tried to cut it) thin enough to be cut with a medium sized bolt cutter, so don't use this to secure irreplaceable data.That being said, it is perfect to deter someone from making the wrong decision, or from seeing a chance and taking it. I think the fact that the padlock looks like a padlock is a very good detriment to theft. Some of the combination lock units could, from afar, look like USB sticks, whereas this looks like a lock from any distance.For some reason, mine did not include instructions, but using it is perfectly intuitive and easy.Note: Despite the above caveats, I just purchased two more for a couple more laptops."
1,"Not Universal, won't fit my Toshiba Satellite L505 Laptop","The greatest problem you can have is with the pivot device, this is what you first much attach to your laptop to secure the cable onto it. Without the pivot device attached you cannot attach the lock or cable.With my Toshiba Satellite L505 laptop, which is just a regular laptop I bought at Bestbuy, I can't fit the pivot the device.Once the pivot device is inserted into the security slot it can't close completely due to the size of my security slot on my laptop, the pivot device must be completely closed and alligned to be functional.Had to mail it back, I'm extremely disapointed and afraid to buy any other laptop locks without fear of them not fitting either.So my advice, research what laptop locks will fit your laptop before making a purchase."
5,Charming is the only word,"This is a pleasurable, surprising, sunshine-filled, leisurely, and -- dare I say it again -- charming book. It's a little dated, but retains its wonderful capacity to evoke a time and place filled with the sights, scents, and sounds of stone masons, oil presses, village fetes, kitchen knives, bursting gardens, market days, voluble peasants, and one indomitable Fiat."
4,Dobrova chocolate hazelnut spread,"This is similar to Nutella. The flavor is slightly milder, but the texture is smoother and it is much easier to spread."
4,Inexpensive insurance,"Having been stuck on a closed mountain road in the wintertime worried about if I were to run out of gas and not having the use of the car heater, these mylar blankets which are small, light and inexpensive are must have emergency materials to carry in all of my cars."
2,CHINA not USA,"I bought these specifically for the fact that they were the only ones I could find that were made in the USA. BUT they are not made in the USA, they are made in China. The packaging is also different then shown so I wonder what the ""sold exclusively by"" claim is for?The item is fine but NOT what is being advertised and that is why I am giving 2 stars."
1,Didn't work,"We have a Mac Book Pro - this item didn't sync with our computer...we tried several trouble shooting ideas, but it never worked. Also, fairly cheaply made, flimsy plastic."
3,Laptop attached keypad,Works well.. need to aim at keyboard. And the USB is too large to fit another usb cable in the adjacent slot! Still very helpful if typing spreadsheets often.
3,Not fantastic - better than OK,"Targus Wireless Stow-N-Go Keypad AKP01USThis is a better than OK product, not great or fantastic. For some reason the left/right; up/down arrows do not work, even when I depress teh NUM LOCK key. When I depress numbers I then have to depress the 'Enter' key; cannot use the down arrow key - like I would in an Excel spreadsheet. I have to admit I am not used to using a keypad such as this."
3,Not bad,"This product works very well and is easy to use. The only draw back I have noticed is that my coworker has the same keypad and we cannot both use them at the same time. If we both have the receivers plugged in, whatever I type shows up on both screens."
4,Excellent video,"The video is an excellent introduction into using the table saw correctly. I like the fact that Kelly doesn't use his Unisaw to show the work, but borrowed at contractor saw from a friend. This way he showed that you can do excellent work without high end equipment. The section about the crosscut sled was a little long."
2,Watch out for paper cuts!,"The envelopes are fine except for the glue strip. It doesn't come to the edge of the flap so if you use your forefinger to press the flap to seal it, you WILL get paper cuts. Now I use my fist to pound the flap down after getting two bad paper cuts."
2,Not as great as expected,"I don't have anything to compare ours to, but I'm not that thrilled with our trailer. It's very small for two children, the seat is like one giant sling so it's not comfortable, and the harness is a huge pain. I expected the harness to be a pain because of other reviews, but I expected the seat to be more comfortable and for two kids to fit pretty well. Because it's like one giant sling, keeping two children in place comfortably is very hard. I would not buy again."
3,Good for the money,"This bike trailer was definitely worth the money. You can spend a lot more on bike trailers, but this one is functional and I believe safe. My only complaint is that because we keep it outside, the snaps for the cover have rusted and are hard to secure."
3,very bad buckle,i love this bike trailer but why they made the buckle soooo hard. it takes me like 3 minutes to unbuckle my son and about two minutes to buckle him.also i like the fact that this trailer is not heavy.
5,Matt is AWESOME,"I have been listening to Matt for 2 going on 3 years and he is awesome. I didn't think his music could get any better until I heard Twenty Three Places. If you love relaxing music that you listen to driving in the car with all the windows down and singing along at the top of your lungs, then this CD is the one for you. I have given this CD to almost everyone I know and not one person has had anything bad to say about it!"
5,The Standard Book on the Topic,"Kennedy was a Sub-Lt aboard HMS Tartar one of the destroyers chasing Bismarck. His book is the best one I've come across on the topic. It is a fairly comprehensive history of the Bismarck and a very balanced account of her first and only operational mission. The book is well-written, and seems to make extensive use of both British and German sources. All in all, the best book I know of on the topic. Highly recommended."
3,Global Lukewarming,"The book has several great concepts, but delivers the goods in a piecemeal fashion. As a fan of apocalyptic writing, I found the novel average, at best. The characters are interesting, and the plot offers a few twists, but the loose writing and dialogue hurt the overall effort."
3,They could do better,"The colour-coded doors are fun for my child to open and close; however, the roof is red, not colour-coded to match the doors and the animals who are supposed to fit (extremely snugly) into the slots in the red roof do not in any way resemble their real-life counterpart or accepted caricature. Also the choice of animals for a 'zoo' is peculiar - I mean, a camel or a sea-lion? On the other hand, my child has taken great delight in banging every conceivable object against this toy and it STILL looks out of the box new."
2,Small corner of LCD broken upon delivery,"After opening the box and inserting the batteries, I noticed that the LCD display in the lower right hand corner was broken (Liquid was displaying over the number.) I was just about the return it when I noticed there was a return fee and decided it wasn't worth my trouble. After hanging the clock, I did notice that the extra ""liquid"" disappeared and the clock works fine. I just don't know how long it will last."
5,Very functional,"Very clear easy-to-read data. I can read it from across the room. I bought it for day and date, which show clearly. No trouble, except quite a bit of set-up of starting data, which I had to go round a couple of times."
3,Short working range,"I have used CS50 for a long time and I got 510S as a replacement. After trying 510S for a few days, I went back to CS50:Pros:Works for both my landline and cell phone at the same time, I realy like this.Good sound quality.Cons:Compares with CS50, I got much shorter range. This is the deciding factor that I switched back to CS50. Had it been a class 1 (100M range), I would have kept it and given it five stars.If you do not require a work range more than a couple of meters, this is the right product for you."
3,Works okay,"The device is by no means attractive, but the headset does work both when connected to the base-station/telephone as well as my cellphone. Sound quality seems good for me; once or twice the person I was speaking with said it sounded like there was background noise when I was speaking. Range is fine, and I can walk around and do things while using the device."
2,too much stingo,"While keeping me awake with the history of Sophie, I continually nodded off from Styron's ramblings through Stingo. I was never endeared by Stingo, nor did I ultimately care what he had to say. Unfortunately what he had to say constituted 90% of a long book."
3,Very involved,"Okay, if you've got a few days to sit down and get deeply involved in this story, fine, go for it. If you're someone who stops and starts on books, just don't bother.This is a book that demands your full attention, forget trying to watch TV at the same time, its impossible. And if you can get past the initial 50 pages, then you'll probably make it all the way through the book. I've tried several times to finish this book and found myself getting frustrated at Styrons writing style. Well, after getting the flu and not moving off the couch for a couple of days, I finally succeeded, and it was worth it. With the time to just sit and really concentrate I found the story really involving and beautiful, if extremely sad. What a choice!The only reason I'm only giving it three stars is that I think I'm a typical reader, and I read books to enjoy them - I don't want to have to lock myself away for days simply to be able to read a book. I'll leave that to the people studying English Literature."
3,Sophie's Choice,It made a great movie ...... but I found myself turning pages without reading just to find out about Sophie! I don't recommend the book for easy reading either.
2,Can't stomach it.,Maybe a great literary achievement but I did not enjoy reading even part of it. Quit Halfway through. Moved on to a much better book--Bring Up the Bodies by Hilary Mantel.
5,Worth a second read,"I first read this book several years ago. It was so powerful that it has always stayed with me. Therefore, many years later, I recently read it again. I was just as mesmorized by the story of Sophie, Nathan, and Stingo as I was years ago. Some other Amazon reviewers said it was too long, but I beg to differ. A great book can't be too long. A great book is so enjoyable to read that the reader does not want it to end; just the way I feel about Sophie's Choice. I am sure I will read it again someday.As a mother, I can relate to the ""choice"" which Sophie was forced to make; a choice which subsequently destroyed her. It wasn't that had Sophie chosen otherwise she would have been able to accept the outcome. Her undoing was in having to choose at all.Tragic, sad, powerful. I loved it."
3,A Mixed Result,"Sophie's Choice tells three stories: Two--Sophie's slow steadily more apalling chronicle of her stay in a Nazi concentration camp, and her love affair with the brilliant Nathan, who is not who he seems to be--are worth telling. The third story, which unfortunately takes up most of the book, is worthless. It is the story of the narrator Stingo, who mistakenly believes he is interesting. He pours out tiny details of his life story, his frustrations, his ambitions, his triumphs, but he is utterly pedestrian. Next to Sophie's ordeal, Stingo's unhappiness (stemming from his poverty and his sexual frustration) seems unearned and meaningless. Stingo's story is worth telling not because he himself is fascinating, but because he is a mundane man who encountered--and had to make sense of--a trace of evil. Unfettered by Stingo's narrative ramblings about his life and Sophie's, this book would have been powerful. A story of the Holocaust needs no adornment; its horror speaks for itself."
5,"Most Brilliant Book After Look Homeward, Angel...","In a brilliant novel that draws upon the post-WWII years, Styron captures the guilt and shame that spans across the continents. Inspired by the haunting Southern spirit of Wolfe and Faulkner, a young Southern writer travels North only to discover a horrifying story of a Polish woman who survived Aushwitz and her schizophrenia-stricken lover. A must-read to anyone looking for the new and unusual perspectives on history, as well as to those who hold as their life's meaning, the craft of writing."
5,Movie popcorn he we come!,I was given this product from a friend after having a deep conversation about how much we like fresh popped movie popcorn. She went on and on about how this popcorn is the greatest thing since movie theatre popcorn. Okay....lets give it a try and my goodness this really does taste like the popcorn I get at the movies without the high cost!
5,past to present,"this book that Mr. Armstrong wrote is but one of many that He gave freely to all who responded to his teachings of the living GOD ,since his death ,the church spilt ,but GOD is using HIS church today through the PHILADELPHIA CHURCH OF GOD ,which teaches what Mr. ARMSTRONG TAUGHT !! The Key Of David program is on weekly -the Trumpet Magazine is published freely ,and now a new book is available titled RAISING THE RUINS -to let people know what happened to the church ,a must read !"
3,Seiko Watch,"As a railroad engineer, I have been wearing this brand and type watch for years and have found it to be exceptional. However, this time the watch band is too tight; where as before I had to have links removed. I have emailed Seiko concerning this problem and have not received a reply."
4,Great Ribbon Great price,"I got the ribbon, fast and it works great. love my printer. THe software is not the greatest but I would recommend it."
3,Not much Ribbon to It,The cassett works well and is easy to install. The quality of print is good. The downfall is there is not much ribbon to it. I only seem to get about 25 CD's to a ribbon. That is using a 5 line format. Over all I like the product. Shop around though. I have found the prices vary a lot from different company's.
3,Interesting info,"I really like the ideas and concepts he puts forth in this book. My only complaint is the ""power glyphs"" he writes on. I recommend creating your own system of glyphs for use. Maybe basing your glyphs on the ideas he presents in the book. Pick up ""Stealing the Fire from Heaven"" for a nice compliment to this book."
3,Chaos by any other name....,A practical guide to servitor creation- using 'power glyphs'- sigils to you and me:) Personally i found the 'power glyphs' presented weren't completely to my taste- so be prepared to be creative:)Where this book sometimes repeats information stated elsewhere it makes up for this with many interesting bits of information on spirits through the ages and within different traditions. A good addition to any practical magickians library
1,the book is just another book,"I am suprised that this book gets so many stars as have many trading books and the book is the same ole read ,yes you may learn some things from it but not as great as the hype put upon it...the teacher is not teaching very well as you need to really know something about fibonacci to understand what he tries to say,bottom line this book is over hyped and is not a must read,sorry I usually give books a good grade but this one is not good ...so I will tell you so"
5,Visiting in an Age of Mission,"Kennon Callahan is the most helpful consultant in the area of mission growth for churches. This introduction to visiting tackles an uncomfortable subject for many church people, and offers a number of nonthreatening, helpful ways to meet and serve people in the community. It would be especially helpful with pastors, membership/evangelism/outreach committees, and visiting teams. Callahan helps visiting to seem like something fun you've always wanted to do, rather than something dreadful you feel you have to do anyway. Enjoy!"
3,Don't seem to be as comfortable as past Aetrex shoes,"Have used these shoes for years. Each time I get them, it feels like I am walking on a pillow when I first use them. I wear them 24/7. (I put my orthodics in always) However, this time, they just seem hard inside. I don't feel the relief I usually feel, and nothing with me has changed. Maybe I just need to break them in more."
2,Crash and Burn,"This toy is just that, a toy. It only has a rudder control and you have to adjust the trim manually. This means that if you throw it and it doesn't go up, it will go down, HARD. As did mine on the first try. It's nose broke off but it still flew after adjusting the trim. The fully charged battery lasts about 3 minutes which is just about enough time to crash it 3 more times. I must say that even though the nose, cockpit and tail broke off, the wings stayed in good shape and I think it will fly again with the scotch taped up parts. Good luck with this one."
2,Information for the totally uninitiated,"I am self aware of the fact that humans are not just bent over and stiff with pain because they are older.With just my own observations and changes in habits many pains are controlled and I am looking to expand my knowledge as to why the few changes I have made work and what I can add to help my life.This book mirrors my thoughts but adds nothing to my learning.There is zero chance that I am going to be able to follow the advice to go and live in another city for weeks or if a class was available locally pay to attend two or three time a week one on one classes, although if my lottery comes through that would change.If you have no concept of how to deal with ordinary ""aging"" issues buy the book,I am going to check out a DVD and hope for more information."
3,Not very good...,"I love most every sonic game! This game though, was hard to learn how to play. The controls are hard to learn and remember. The voice overs are terrible! They didn't fit the characters and sounded like something was in tails throat dieing. It was hard to defeat the bosses and hard to figure out where to go, what to do, ext. I was very happy to see the chaotix in a PS2 game! I would buy more games with them in it because it reminds me of the comics. I also like the fact that they put Rouge in a game. I'd give this game 3 stars because of the characters and because they chose to make this game for PS2"
3,Alright,"Not his best work, you can definitly tell he had some tough times during the making of this album. Easy listening. I've heard better from Citizen Cope though."
3,A methodical but savvy tale of the mean streets of D.C.,"Derek Strange is a P.I. who knows D.C. As a football coach, he teaches young kids lessons that will keep them alive on the drug-infested streets. But when one of his players mistakenly goes home with his uncle and is killed in a drive-by shooting, Derek will do anything to find out who is responsible. His white partner is involved in his own mission to take a young prostitute off the D.C. streets. But to do so, he must first take on the girl's pimp. What makes this book better than most is Strange's flawed character. In this outing, he's having commitment issues with his long-time girlfriend. Can he rid himself of his bad habits, particularly his fascination with massage parlors?"
1,Hell to pay is correct.,"This book is mostly about a bunch of gangsters doing gangster stuff. Many filthy words and deeds. I read about half of it and could not read any more. I kept hoping there would be a point to it,but could find none in the first half of the book. When I purchased the book, I never dreamed it would not even have a real plot or maybe I could not recognize it. I have read hundreds of books, but none like this!!!!"
1,Hell to listen to,"This audio book, like many of those by ""Brilliance Audio"" is difficult to listen to...especially while driving. I listen to a book a week, and the only ones I've encountered with bad quality are by this company. The sound quality is bad, and the dialect impossible to understand. Buy the book, skip the audio."
2,Decent book,"I am climbing Rainier for the first time later this year, so my wife bought this for me as a Christmas gift.I was a little disappointed. The practical information is very outdated. If you are looking for a great history of Rainier and former climbing expeditions, this is the book for you. Keep in mind that this book was originally written in 1973 so there is not much modern information. The are very few photos in this book. Most are black and white pencil illustrations. Unfortunately, there a very few books on Rainier and this is probably among the best. If you are looking for general mountain adventure books, look elsewhere. This reads more like a textbook."
3,"Not great ,but not terrible...","While this model does have good detail ( better than that of most cheaper model brands ) I had issues with it going together. The instructions didn't always match the model ( holes would be shown and there were none etc. ). It you're looking for a model with a lot of pieces this one's for you...But,since most of them get covered up anyway, does it matter? Guess it depends on what you like."
5,grads,"We've tried a number of irons in the past few years and this is the best. The heat settings, shape, steam function and all the other features on this model are fine, but its weight is what makes it most effective. One pass over clothes usually does the trick. Definitely worth the money."
1,An Abomination in General and a Disgrace to Doctor Who,"What can I say? This HAS to be the all-time low point of the entire 35 year run of Doctor Who! (And I'm taking into consideration that ALL of the McCoy era is utter rubbish!) Here we have a plot which is breathtakingly incomprehensible (and believe me, it still doesn't make any sense even after repeated viewings!), atrocious acting, and characters which are pure cardboard. Don't even get me started about the over-the-top music and the terrible special effects. Perhaps worse of all is this episode's focus on Ace's continuing ""personal discovery"", which is given great dramatic emphasis, but which has absolutely no payoff! I appeal to you to save your hard-earned money for some Pertwee or Baker (Tom OR Colin) episodes!!!"
4,Darwinian Horror in Who,"An interesting episode in McCoy's final season as the Doctor. The Doctor and Ace find themselves trapped in a Victorian mansion with mysterious aliens who are cataloging Earth and its inhabitants. The dialogue is clever and the story is fast-paced; however, the plot is so quick that it is difficult to fully grasp at the first viewing. Still, a chilling story, with a fine performance by Sophie Aldred as Ace."
5,EXCELLENT,I LIKE THIS WHOLE ALBUM. I NEVER HEARD OF ANGELA AMMONS B4 UNTIL A FRIEND PLAYED HER CD IN HIS CAR ONE DAY. MY FAVORITE SONG IS 4..SO PRETTY
5,Where the Heck is the Publicity???,"She is definitely in the same league as Michelle Branch, Avril Lavigne and Vanessa Carlton, so why isn't she getting the same publicity? Someone needs some better marketing!Excellent debut, extremely catchy music, and a great future. It's terrific that these new female artists are changing the face of pop music. It's about time!"
1,Worst Asics Ever,"I have always purchased Asics volleyball sneakers in the past, and this year was no different. However, I have been unable to break in the Sensei. This sneaker is so uncomfortable. The sneaker digs into the side of my right foot, and I am not the only one that has had this problem. My husband purchased the men's sensei, and I have two other friends that purchased the sensei. All have the same issue with the sneaker digging into the side of the right foot in the same location. I cannot believe that I paid over $100 for a volleyball sneaker that is so uncomfortable. This shoe is garbage. Don't waste your money!"
5,Books From the Heart = An Amazing and Personal Gift,"When my brother decided to get married, I wanted to do something personal for him and my future sister-in-law. I was stumped as to what I could do, when I stumbled onto the Books From the Heart website .... I was ecstatic because it was exactly what I was looking for! When I received it soon after in the mail, I excitedly began my project. The instructions were clear and easy to follow, and I enjoyed making it. My brother loved it, and I can't wait to make another!"
4,Riveting--Prepare to Lose Sleep!,"Although it took me a few pages to get into this book, once I was in, I was hooked. Terri Jentz's account of her terrible ordeal was fascinating, sad, irritating, and thorough. In fact, the only problem with this book is that it is TOO thorough. Ms. Jentz gives tons of detail that occasionally makes the book unnecessarily confusing, which is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. I was very interested in the story about the lady meeting up with Perry Smith and Dick Hickock--I remain fascinated with the Clutter murders and this was a tidbit I didn't know. I hope one day Dirk Duran receives a truly proper punishment for all the terrible things he has done--it amazes me how women who are otherwise smart and strong can fall for a line of bull. Maybe this book will open a few eyes."
4,Long and Winding Road,"I thought the strength of the book was the writing. Jentz really knows how to grab her reader and take him/her on the wild ride that is her life. I was immersed in the land of Oregon and all its strange/wonderful/crazy characters. In her youth, Jentz went on a quest to see America and sadly she saw the worst of it. When she revisits the crime scene years later she's able to comprehend more fully the narrative of the west and how she fits into this narrative. The only thing missing was a little more of Jentz' present life - how did this affect her relationship with her parents? I noticed she dedicated the book to her partner, Donna and wondered how the crime affected Jentz' relationship with men, women, etc. Overall, a compelling, terrifying and important read."
2,Long piece of paradise,"I have read about 400 pages of this rambling novel. Unfortunately, that's all I am going to read. This book starts off with promise, but falters with terribly repetitive and pointless chapters."
1,Wuss rock to a new level!,"I'm a BIG fan of hybrid theory, one of my all time favorite cds the songs never get old. When I first heard What I've Done on Myspace I thought okay this new album sounds great. So I marked my calendar for today and went and picked it up. After listening to the whole cd the only real LP song is What Ive done, I felt robbed. They released that song to give you a flavor for that album but the after-taste wont wash out now. After listening to that CD I had to pop in some heavy metal to get it out of my head. This CD is boring, uninspired and lame. I'm sure all the girlies will love it but not us metal-heads. Maybe I'll listen to it if I can't get to sleep otherwise it'll be collecting dust. STAY AWAY FROM THIS!"
1,Minutes to Midnight - yeah its a disastor alright!,"I am a huge Linkin Park fan, I nearly cried when I first heard this release. It was terrible! Worse than terrible. After I hand listened it I turned to my boyfriend and said ""The alternative music market must be too easy for them because this is soft rock - they sound like fricken U2!"". I got the making of with the CD and thats pretty much what they said, they were branching out to reach a wider audience. Well I hope they realize they are alienating their existing fans.If you are into pop and soft (soft, soft, soft) rock... this is for you, if you are a fan of the Linkin Park sound... this is a waste of money because its simply not there."
1,Here we go again................,"Anybody remember when bands just played music and were happy with that? What happen to the days of picking up an album and listening to great timeless songs about nothing? Now, all we get from bands that think way to much of themselves is whine whine whine. I wish all of these whiny bands would make 2 versions of their albums; One with whine and one without. By the way, when I say ""nothing"" I mean no political agenda, no ""cause"" to rant about just great music. LP is an awesome and talented band but I don't buy albums to hear someone else's opinion of something. And, LP is way to talented to have to drop the ""F"" bomb to try and please a group that called them ""emo"" anyway. I know I know, if you don't like the album don't buy it........... Hmmmm, I'll remember that..........."
5,Minutets to Midnight,"Have you ever heard of Linkin park? Ever hear them? Well if not, then you just have to hear they're new album, ""minuets to Midnight"" (unless you have heard them , in that case, its mandatory). Starting off with a song with no words has been a tradition with Linkin Park and they're keeping it with the hard core song ""wake"". Then the punk rock song after that just locks you in your seat with its catchy tune. Later followed by a war song that'll be #1 when it hits the radio.I loved ""minuets to midnight"" and everything in it. It has so many mixtures of genres including Punk, Rock, Rap, and Metal, it'll get anyone that's into music to buy their next CD.I think that this would be a good CD for anyone into punk rock, and mainly people that are ages 14-27, because its too hard (core) for little kids, its rapping should get teens and young adults, while keeping away some older fans."
4,Give it some time...,"Now, I've seen a lot of reviews listed discussing how this album doesn't reflect the rough, anger-fueled music of the Linkin Park of the past, and after my first listen this is the same feeling I had.But then I gave it another shot. And another. I gave it time to soak into my mind. I asked myself, ""Why did Linkin Park decide to take this lighter sound?"". Then I realized that they decided to take the approach of letting the lyrics speak for themselves instead of forcing the sound into the listener. Give this album some time, look past what it is missing from the older Linkin Park albums and see what it has gained. I have done this and I believe that ""Minutes to Midnight"" is as good as ""Meteora""."
1,What happened to the amazing band you were?,"Linkin Park. Hybrid Theory changed my life, it absolutely CHANGED my life, it made me want to listen to rock, metal, death metal, and everything I listen to today, your earlier albums HT and Meteora helped me discover everything I love about music and I became a musician myself as a result.I waited YEARS for you to put out a new album, I waited and waited for every drop of news I could possibly find. Then that day finally came when Minutes To Midnight was finally released.. it turned out to be the worst day of my life. I destroyed your cd within an hour of purchasing it and I'll never look back on it. This album is emo/pop mainstream garbage and I'll have none of it."
1,Way off Par,"I purchased this album months ago and waited a while to give it a chance. I do agree that it is important for a band to branch out try new things and open up new doors, what LP does here is branch out too far. In doing so they lost what originally attracted so many"
2,Sometimes Change Isn't Good!,"I'm not going to labor you with details of the ""reformed LP"" more like the ""deformed LP"" since others seemed have done that here. LOL. LP is still good. Maturity does result in change... Yeah, some songs sorta of the flav of the classic LP, thank God for memories. 2 1/2 stars."
2,sell out,this album is sad. it is far from the rockin' Hybrid Theory. i am very disappointed that i have wasted my money on this one! they really need to pick up the pace. i don't want ballads from these guys.
1,Worst Album Of 2007 So Far,"When I First Heard That Rick Ruben Was Behind This CD I Got Really Excited, With All His Work With Slipknot, Jay-Z, And Countless Other Bands I Though This Would Have Been Old School Rockin LP But No. They Change There Style For The Worst, When Some Bands Change Style It Can Be Refreshing And A Good Thing But Not With These Guys. This Is One Of The Biggest Flops I Have Ever Heard, The Days Of Headbanging And Mosh Pits Are Over Traded In For Slow Garbage. It Is Not Even Worth Time To Sample It, Find Some Sucker That Has It And Laugh At Him For Making Such A Bad Mistake Like I Did. When They Go On Tour This Summer You Will Not Hear One Song Off This CD, Maybe The Single Because That Is The Hardest Song On Here. I Feel Your Pain Die Hard LP Fans, Let Hope They Never Repeat This Sound, EVER."
4,You have to differenciate different from bad,"In few words: if you expect to hear the same LP sound from Hybrid or Meteora, you will be highly dissappointed. Doesn't mean that it's a bad record but it's like a totally different band, most of the songs are ballads, and some passages you swear you are listening U2.Buy it only if you will dare to erase all the previous paradigms and preconceptions on LP's sound to start from scratch."
1,Frustrating to listen to,"Listening to this CD is nothing but an exercise in frustration. You'll spend every song waiting for a climax that never comes. It's so obvious even to someone who's not a musician where every one of these songs should have gone but didn't. You'll hear it in your mind and wonder why the hell LP didn't hear the same and produce it. Sounds like they were just [...] around the entire time. I've listened to this three times in the span of a year b/c each time I was hoping it wasn't as bad as I'd remembered and it was equally disappointing each time to the point I skipped past nearly every song on the third go. I have wide musical tastes so I can appreciate different things, but what they tried to do here just didn't work and they knew it and apparently didn't care. I won't be buying anything from LP again without doing my research and listening to it first. I'll only be fooled once, never again."
1,"Will always remember the old Linkin, before they vanished.","I've been a fan of them for a long time, however when the changed their sound, I hoped that they might get their sound back. Unfortunately, they are stuck with ballads. If they ever did a reanimation-Esq album, it would be great if they added a dubstep nu-rock twist. But only time will tell if the will keep on sounding like U2."
2,"Not throw-away awful, but still bad none-the-less","I can't describe how eagerly I awaited this CD. I'm a big Linkin Park fan, but after listening to this CD, I may be more hesitant to buy any more of their CDs. It starts off okay with 'Wake', but then goes down hill. Most of the songs are soft, and not the 'soft' kind of way that made In The End a great song. The music itself seems different, and Chester makes up so much of this album that you wonder if Mike Shinoda was off doing another solo album. I miss the two of them singing/rapping in the same song, but you won't find a lot of that here. You also won't find any of those good-ole Linkin Park songs from the past. It really felt more like a Chester solo-album, and it wasn't that good. I give it two stars only because of the two or three songs I can pick out of this mess that I can listen to. Hopefully their next album, which following their time line won't come out until around 2010, will be better."
2,Where's Linkin Park?,"I've been listening to Linkin Park for as long as I can remember. First, I loved Hybrid Theory, then I realized that I like Meteora even more. I felt like I couldn't survive a second with them, but Minutes To Midnight just seems so.... fake. It feels like Linkin Park has turned into something else. They might as well change their name.To all fans, get a box of tissues before you start listening to this album.Maybe their next album (if they make one) will be closer to what they were, to what they still are.... They just wanted to tap into a different part of their minds I guess."
2,I'm angry and Chester's not,"Like many of the posters, I've been waiting on pins and needles to get my hands on LP's new release. And like most of the reviews I've read, I'm disappointed. Listening to LP was a state of mind. It got you pumped up. The mix of Chester's screaming with the hip-hop created a one of kind sound you didn't get from any other band. This album erases all that. I want screaming Chester, not the mild, thoughtful and melodious Chester. An earlier poster said this was LP's version of U2's Joshua Tree, a defining album for their future. I agree with part of that assessment, except I think the LP album is more comparable to U2's Pop disaster. I'm all for growing musically, but remember your roots. LP pulled up the tree with this thing."
1,Poor,"Sorry, I really enjoyed Hybrid Theory and Meteora, but this is just a poor effort for such a talented band. I had expectations like anyone else, but this is so below what LP is capable of."
4,"good, not as good as Meteora","First, about all of the people who posted to the discussion before the release date saying, ""I work for a radio station and I listened to this album,"" I would like to assert that they are all a bunch of liars, because I am not listening to the same album that they described, whether they wrote positive or negative comments. Chester does in fact scream, although more of the material tends toward Place Where I Belong kind of style. And Mike Shinoda has two songs where he raps and one where he actually sings for a change (although that is one of the songs that doesn't grab me). I pre-ordered this album but procrastinated listening to it because I was afraid that I was going to be disappointed. No, it's not as good as Meteora or Hybrid Theory, and there are a couple songs that I don't care for at all, but as a whole piece it is pretty good."
2,Why linking Park! Why?,Im going to make this quick. I've been a huge linkin park fan since I first saw the video for crawling. After that I had to have all their tracks and I enjoyed every bit of their last albums. But I dont know what happined here! This cd sounded like a pop album with sad songs for chicks. Omg I couldnt believe what I was hearing. So I gave it another listen while on my way to work. And their were only about 2-3 songs that were ok. What I liked most about the Linkin Park sound was the rap/rock mix and chesters vocals when he screams. It used to send chills thru my back. Well thats all gone now. I wish I could ask these guys wtf happined dudes!? You guys were on a role! Well anyways So if you enjoyed the other linkin park albums you might want to skip this one. Because im telling you you wont like it! I just hope they go back to the old sound on their next album. I just hate having to wait again. -_-
2,Not Too Good,I'm a huge Linkin Park fan. I have always loved their alternative sound. This cd was not Likin Park. It sounded like a different band all together. I was disappointed with it. I feel that when a band finds a good sound that works they should stick with it. Hopefully their next cd will be better.
2,Lost me after the second track....,What a disappointment... I blame the Fort Minor detour for this. They got soft. Tragic.
1,HORRIBLE,Ok...this album...SUCKS and thats putting it lightly. Long gone are the days of Hybrid Theory and the good mix of rap and rock. This was a waste of my money (which i ran out and bought the limited edition the day it came out). I mean...come on guys seriously who wants to listen to a bunch of whiney emo songs from yet another sellout band? I have lost all respect completely for this band and this album is to blame. Yes it does have evolution but its not a good one. I understand that they arent gonna put out another hybrid theory but could you atleast keep the awesome guitars and the hard rock beat to it? And wheres Mike on this one? It seems he is disapearing from the band which i dont like. All in all i recomend this album to no one who respects rock music its a waste of money
1,TOTAL JUNK!!!!,I bought the Linkin Park album and put myself through the pain of sitting and listening to every second of every song. This album is Linkin Park at their WORST!! They should of never went with producer Rick Rubin and should of stayed with Don Gilmore. Linkin Park is ruined!! I have bought all there cds' as they have come out but because of this one I will listen to somebody elses before I will buy there next album!! DO NOT waste your money!!
1,Return to Sender,"If you liked Linkin Park for their fast paced tempo and hard lyrics then you will be very, very dissapointed. I would return this album had I not purchased it already from Itunes. The only songs that mildly relate in style to their previous two albums are What I've Done, Bleed It Out, and No More Sorrow.I would have given this album zero if I had the option. I'm not a fan or the new music at all. It's also not the type of music that will grow on you. If you like a lot of slower paced alternative music, then give this album a try."
1,Sell outs.,"And there is nothing wrong with that.But that doesn't change the fact: The music here sucks.Ok. Bleed it out is good. Given up is classic Linkin Park.But the rest of the album, especially ""Leave out all the rest"" ""Valentine's day"" and ""What I've done"" are horrible, radio made songs. They are clearly targeted to little kids, unlike the mature audience of their first two albums. Instead of singing about things teens care about, they are singing about things BABIES care about. Seriously.. who writes a song about Valentine's day.. They are trying to connect to an audience who is still in diapers."
4,Look whos grown up,"Some people are down on this album, but those are probably the same kinds of people who have no real musical appreciation; ie the song has to be ""radio worthy"" before it passes their muster. I didnt even like their earlier work, everything sounded the same. This album is much more diverse. Of the 12 songs, only Given Up, Bleed it out (kinda), What Ive done, and No more sorrowcould be considered rockers. So its much different. But in my opinion, this is what makes an album, and not a singles collection. If you are a real LP fan, you'll pick this up, and i think youll really be happy with it. Im not a big LP fan, but i was interested because i heard it would be different, and it is, and i applaud them for sticking themselves out there."
4,new and different and impressive,"read some good reviews and some not so good...but I really love linkin park so had to hear for myself...I can see what some diehards might be missing, but I still think this is an impressive group of songs...that grow on me more and more with ever listen. great vocals, interesting songs, miss some of the rapping but whats there is real good....think these guys are trying to evolve...but hold on to their sound...just explore new places...and while i love their loud stuff...and i love when they take you on a roller coaster ride from rough to smooth on the same track...but i must say, they can deliver a strong, stirring ballad...with just enough edge and reality to keep it from being a sappy result"
3,good CD,"The CD starts out great, just as LP's other recordings. Later in the disc it is not as hard and in-your-face as I expected it to be. This is where I give it a lower rating, but overall it is a good CD."
1,LAAAME!!,"Man, after listening to ""What I've Done"", I was SOOO excited to hear this CD. BAH! It's sooo bad!! What happened?!?This is just like My Chemical Romance's ""Black Parade"" CD. The ONLY song I liked off that album was, well, Black Parade. Same with this CD, I only like WID.With Hybrid Theory and Meteoria, both had a slew of kickin' LP trademark music that was super catchy and you could learn the words to in minutes. This CD however is SLOW, SAPPY AND EMO! What happened to Mike's rapping?! It's practically non-existent in this CD. And what happened to the music? It's so quiet. I mean, I love Chesters voice n' all, but, um, music please?I'm VERY disappointed with the CD. Just PLEASE! People! Listen to the CD in a store first before purchasing!! Don't waste your money if you don't have to!P.S. Linkin Park, I'm sorry to give such a bad review, but from a loyal fan, you disappointed me today."
2,A Step Backwards for Linkin Park,"Being a strong supporter of Linkin Park from when they were called Hybrid Theory, I believe they have taken a step backwards with their music. What made them stand out in their past albums were their rhythmic beats and flashy intros. However, after completing my first listen through of Minutes to Midnight, it seemed like all 12 tracks lacked strong intros and melody. The chorus is very Thirty Seconds to Mars like, in that it lacked that usual Linkin Park intensity and fire. A couple months ago, I heard one of their other songs going around on the internet called Qwerty. After listening to that song and knowing that they were looking towards changing their style, I was anticipating more metallic rather then a soft alternative rock. Overall, for those who haven't purchased this album ----> save your money."
2,Not That Great Of A CD!!!,I Thought This CD Was Pretty Bad! Nothing Close To The Past CD's.I Thought This CD Only Had 4 Decent Songs On It.I Wouldn't Waste Your $ On This Album!*Given Up*Bleed It Out*What I've Done*No More Sorrow
4,A Little Confused,"I've owned the D2x for several years. It is still a great performer, albeit more limited now since the advent of the D300, D700, and D3s (all of which I own also). I will never get rid of my D2x as it is, as I said, a great performer...workhorse build, excellent low iso performance, overall still produces outstanding images. What confuses me though is that Amazon is still selling it new for @$5,800. What's up with that. You can find a pristine copy on ebay for probably under $1,500. That, in my opinion, would be the best bet for anyone interested in this Nikon gem."
2,Denzel Goes Gangsta'!!!,"I thought it started off really slow and thought it would never pick up. Finally, later it did. There are some parts that reminded me of 'The Godfather' The parts I liked were when there was gun-fights and some hot nude black girls help with the heroine. I probably wouldn't recommend AMERICAN GANGSTER!!!"
4,"Great movie, but","I thoroughly enjoyed this movie even though it has been likened to Serpico and it re-enforces my respect for Ridley Scott as a Director. I do however have a couple of negative points to make. First, the sound quality. Like Starr* Burst's review earlier, I found the dialogue difficult to hear and had to turn up the volume. The second point is the cast. It was difficult to envisage Cuba Gooding Jr as the flamboyant character he plays as I always see him in goofy kid movies and it kind of watered down the believability factor. The same goes with Denzel Washington, although he is a classy actor with some great movies under him, I had a hard time picturing him as this ruthless character Lucas, kind of like Tom Hanks playing a hitman in Road To Perdition, you know he's a nice guy. Perhaps I am being too picky though as he does act this role exceptionally well."
4,Excellent Film - Bad DVD,"""American Gangster"" comes thisclose to being a classic film of it's type.Washington and Crowe are terrific. Ruby Dee takes advantage of her small role and shows what acting is all about. But... and this is a BIG BUT, the DVD's quality is horrible. It's hard to watch this movie and not constantly say to yourself... somebody screwed up here! Both the dull look of this movie on DVD, and a soundtrack that is often subpar make mewonder what the heck happened?"
5,What a great movie should be,"Great real life, old school, gangster. I really enjoyed this movie and the story line from beginning to end. If you like movies like ""Blow"" you will enjoy this one as well."
2,A realistic life of Lucas would have been more interesting.,"Great acting, OK directing and terrible writing. Washington, Ejiofor and Crowe and great as usual, Scott seems to be bored and the writing might just be mediocre if it wasn't claimed to be ""based on a true story."" Among the bizarre claims is that Frank Lucas' collaboration ""lead to the conviction of three-quarters of the NY DEA."" Reality: zero convictions. He only testified against fellow dealers. Also his relationship with Bumpy Johnson has been falsified. Johnson's widow calls Lucas a liar and the movie false. These are just two of about a half dozen major distortions. Gangster movies are apparently going back to Godfather style fantasy rather than to realism."
4,American Gangster,"Based on a true story 'American Gangster' takes us on another gangster style journey, but made refreshing as not based around the Mob or Italian stereotypes. As other reviewers here have noted, this film stands out by the great performances of both Washington and Crowe and they both add depth and flair to their respective roles. I was hooked in the first ten minutes and although Washington plays a flawed character, you can't help but like him. Excellently directed and with great supporting actors as well, this film managed to hold my attention for the duration. If you like crime and gangster films then this rates pretty highly and is well worth a look and even if you're not a fan of these films this has enough on offer to appeal to everyone else as well. A solid four star film.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."
5,Great gangster movie,"i have to agree with most everyone else & say i loved this movie. i was reluctant to first rent this movie and by the end of it, i had decided it was a very well put-together movie. i would recommend it to any fan of drug/crime/gangster movies!"
1,I Kept Waiting,I kept waiting for something interesting to happen. I thought it was very predictable. In a nutshell: yawwwwwwwwwwwwn.
3,it's okay...,"it's alright, I thought it was good I like Denzel on most his movies no regrets...I will pick more. hope you have more to offer..."
5,American Gangster,Great movie. Denzel and Crowe excel at acting in this movie. Very interesting focus on the previous corruption of the police force during the Vietnam War. A must see for anyone.
4,"Solid and powerful, at first","When i first put this string on my racquet it was wonderful. I felt powerful and in control on the court. But recently I felt out of control and my arm was getting sore. I have been playing a lot though, so it could be that the strings were losing their resiliency (or fatigue on my part?). Anyway, it looks like these strings will last a good 20 hours of play (3-4 weeks) for me and they will not break. I'm going to try the Big Banger Ace too for comparison."
2,Not for experienced DBA either !!!,"I fully agree with the reader from BC, Canada and totally disagree with reader from White Plains, NY. By covering versions from as far back as 7.3, this book is a hodge podge of different versions. There are lot of page filling techniques in addition to listing all those parameters and events. Writesdisproportionate amount of pages for trivial matters like rowsize calculation or syntaxes and loses focus on main topic. In performance tuning section, dealing with multiple versions creates a total mess and you ending up reading about suggestions & parameters that are obsolete. In Database internals tuning chapter, he lists 8 pages of stapacks report (from a lightly used database!!) and doesn't even bother to discuss its different sections. Book does not explain object related topics well. Quality of examples is very poor. I was totally disappointed. Don't buy this book."
3,wrong shade color,"This lamp is beautiful but the shade is not as described or shown. It is shown as white and the description says it is off-white. However, it is an unattractive gray-beige color. I was so disappointed because I love the base of the lamp. I think I will buy a new shade."
4,The Journey,"A very interesting story that will satisfy the appetites of readers who like a romance with a twist of mystery or a mystery with a twist of romance.After the third or fourth page I was hooked and finished this refreshingly interesting story that uses some history to bring the characters and their surroundings to life, in one sitting. My apologies to the author for passing it on to 3 other readers, all who have enjoyed it very much."
3,"Incomplete Index, errors, some material not fully explained","During the last halve chapters of the book the author started to scurry through topics too quickly. I understand that he was trying to write a book that was not too advanced but I was irritated at new syntax and processes introduced in examples but not fully explained. This was my first Perl book. I admit I did like the book alot in the beginning. But when I began to practice code and needed to look up a keyword or special character I found there was no appendix for characters and keywords and scarcely an index at all. I had to thumb through the book each and every time I wanted to find ""where I had read about"" something."
4,Love Andy Williams at Christmas!,Such a lovely voice and lovely delivery of traditional Christmas songs. It reminds me of his TV specials of years ago.
3,Andy Williams Merry Christmas,"I listened to this album for years as a kid, then the record wore out. I was so happy it was available again, but I can't get the whole album to play! I have to punch in one song at a time which is annoying when one is trying to do something else."
5,Andy Williams Christmas CD,"I love all of Andy Williams music. Been to Branson & his theatre twice. This CD plays ""Over & Over"" but I will have to file it now that Christmas is over."
3,Jane Austen fans only,"Miniatures and Morals: The Christian Novels of Jane AustenOnly buy this to read if you are a severe Jane Austen fan, otherwise, you'll be a bit bored. I was bored - sorry the truth is painful. I love Leithart though, so buy his other books!"
4,A Commercial Success from the 80s,"""Seven Wishes"" is Night Ranger's most successful album, charting in Billboard's top-10 and achieving Gold Status. Some people have knocked it as too commerical, but it is really a great mix of melodic hard rock. Night Ranger has 3 ""hit"" songs on this album, namely, Goodbye, Sentimental Street, and Four in the Morning. All are well-written songs with strong vocals and a good blend of guitars and keyboards. This is probably Night Ranger's best studio album."
4,It's very practical,"It's a very practical, very well informed book. The author quotedthousands of reports."
5,Everything You Need to Know,"A complete how-to book to determine the success of a Web site. Sterne clearly explains how to use metrics to quantify business goals. The tools, services, and techniques for measurement described in the book will be helpful for any e-business or other company with an Internet presence. A must-read."
1,It is out-of-date and unorganized.,"The tone of this book is pretty coversational but unorganized. The information in this book is pretty much out of date. For example, this book still talk a lot of banner ad which is almost out of the scope in today's ad on web, while talking little or nothing about PPC. It brings out some good old metric but nothing new. The technolgy foundation of this book is old and weak and can not reflect and keep up with the current trends.This book is not efficient in pointing out things. It could be more condensed. I don't think this is neccessary to tell the whole author's personal story and some other trivial things to explain things. YOu would just need to point out the definition, and how to apply it, and how to interepte it and etc.This book just includes a lot of unncessary personal story and waste reader's time. If you need a book which is right to the point and nothing more, this book is not right for you."
1,For those who missed the first warning...,I'm so with Rachel. Whirlwind Heat are unutterably tedious.
4,very handy but?,This drill is very handy for tight places great for putting together projects with optional adapter for your sockect sets. Not inculded for short projects this a great tool But keep in mind this is a special tool not to take the place of your every day drill you might use on the job sight. I find the batt. life good but holding the drill for prolong use it gets hot if you dont over work it it will handle dilling 1/2 holes but dont rush it feed drill slow and you will be fine.DeWalt also has a 14.4 model but for the price there is not much torque difference so enless you already own 14.4 cordless tool and already have extra batt. i recomend the 12 volt lighter and cheaper also flashlight works very well very bright My only grip is only one batt. and it gets hot to hold with prolong use but with where the handle is this is to be expected. I have a Panasonic 15.6 for my heavy work best in its class but if you looking for a drill for those hard to reach jobs this is for you.
3,Pinched fingers,"I really like the convenence of a right angle drill/driver,especially since in remodeling I have the occasion to install kitchen cabinets,it is a very usefull tool in installing cabinets,especialing in hard to reach and tight places.I only see one small problem with the right angle drill/driver,this happens when changing from drill to driver,when holding the keyless chuck to losen or tighten drill bit or driver guide, my finger or fingers gets pulled between the chuck and the guard toward the trigger. This causes a sore pinched finger or blood blister. Don't get me wrong I really like my Dewalt Product,as I do the many other Dewalt products I also own. But I'm wondering if anyone else has encountered the pinched fingers? If the guard was made like my 12 volt cordless Dewalt drill/driver then I think this problem would not exist. Thank you for the oportunity for me to review this product."
2,poor quality,"poor poor quality picture & sound for the price. I threw this dvd away and bought a used one of the same movie and artwork case, on eBay. I won't be buying anymore dvd's from Artiflix. The USED dvd has 100% better quality than the new Artiflix one."
2,NOT blue and white,"Well, it does cover my steering wheel and it does have flames. It is not, however, blue and white. :( More like navy blue and teal."
5,The most turning projects in one place ever!,"170 pages. Short chapters on many turning ideas with varations. Black and white photos of objects and how-to, and example objects. Many nuggets of information that you can really use. Very short introduction, no general information, really a ""project"" book. I wish I had found this book sooner, good beginner projects as well as some I won't try for some time yet. Projects: Spurtles (Scottish stirrer), Spatulas, Rollers, Mallets, Outdoor solid decorations (including a mouse), Long & Thin Spindles, Baby rattle, Beads (including puppet), Spheres, Spinning tops (my favorite), Little end-grain bowls, Scoops, Plant Forms, Tall vases, Pepper mills, Cutting boards, Trivets, Bottle Coasters, Trays, Hand mirrors (2 piece, I still like Dick Sing's better), Hollow vessels, Ladles."
4,Dre keeps em comin,"This was a tighter album then I thought it would be. I would give it more than 4 stars but less than 5. All the songs are good but ""No"" can be passed up. The only reason it's not a 5 is that lyricaly the content is empty. As always there is no message or feelings that the songs stir except the urge to blaze, you know? Like I said, all tracks are pretty dope but I'm diggin Bilal's ""Bring 2"" a ChronicClassic."
3,"Disappointing follow-up project from On! Air! Library! guitarist, but contains potential","This is a dissapointing album, considering the leaders' previous band, but it's nevertheless a good find for fans of shoegazing. Unfortunately, the lineup was unsettled during sessions, and as a result there's an inconsistent sound. Also, many songs are underdeveloped, lacking the vibrancy of On! Air! Library! They often suffer from having too few melodies, and from being too slow. At worst, the songs are soporific and boring, like well-produced demos of potentially good songs. At best, they sound like really good eighties goth/shoegazing (like late-decade Cure or early My Bloody Valentine). What works is pretty good, and about half the songs are definitely worth hearing (particularly the ones with Amanda Gerrett: ""To No One"" and ""Please"")."
1,First Spaceship on Venus - Needs to be shelved.,"My suggestion---don't buy this movie unless you rent it first!!! The dialogue is robotic, and poor. The plot is bad. The budget is way below low. I could live with a low budget if the story was in the least bit worth watching. This movie is not even interesting at all. There is no character developement. I could live with the ""Dubbing"" if the movie kept my interest, but it doesn't at all. I kept waiting for it to get good. It never did. If you wan't to see a good low budget movie, see ""It came from outer space"". It will keep your attention."
3,First Spaceship on Venus/Voyage to the Prehistoric Planet,Hold on reviewer #1! This ain't Matrix but both films are quite watchable. The image quality of First Spaceship is as good as anything I've seen on VHS and Voyage is very good. Together provide an interesting look at the Communist bloc sci-fi of the era and the fx stand up pretty well against most of what was coming out of Hollywood at the time. Widescreen and extras would be nice but it IS only seven bucks for the two films. That's $3.50 per. A bargain for a fun double feature.
1,This is the cut version,"There have been a few comments on whether or not this is the cut version. I'm not sure how Amazon associates reviews with titles but comments on the DEFA version shouldn't apply to this DVD which is a St Clair Vision release. The St Clair Vision release is the 80 minute version, not a 130 minute version, despite what the DVD box says and despite what Amazon says. Amazon should correct their information and give some grief to the distributor. I'm returning the DVD as I already have the shorter version in other collections. I'd give the film itself a higher rating - I appreciate it for where it was coming from at the time and, frankly, as camp fun - so this rating is based soley on the false advertising."
3,"Did, get it",Do not know how it is. was estimated to be here on the 22nd for Christmas But it is the 24th and no MP3.False advertising Shop now get it for christmas.I do not think so.My sons Mp3 is 300 miles away.This is what is great about the usa I do not have to come back and shop here agian.Thanks for the time and hope it works.Rob Davis
3,Powered Paragliders Take Note!,"This training manual is a good source of information about learning to fly PPGs, some of which I haven't seen anywhere else. This isn't a book ABOUT paragliding, but a training manual on how to learn to fly and fly safely. There are sections on technical topics, such as wing dynamics, 2-cycle engines, and propeller torque effect; as well as sections on pre-flight checks, take-off techniques, landing, regulations and rules of the air, and emergency procedures, to name a few. All in all, the manual contains a great deal of useful information to complement flight instruction (but by no means should be used as a substitute for professional flight instruction). Many typos and a few drawings that look like they were made with an etch-a-sketch detract from the overall quality. Nevertheless, there is lots of good information here. The section on Emergency Procedures is thorough and excellent."
2,Is this a joke?,"Completely bland, forgettable and boring. From the vivid Moon Safari to this limp offering in 3 years? Annoying vocals, stupid lyrics and an almost complete lack of a hook plus slow, deathly tempos and cold fish drumming, if that's your thing go right ahead. Get lost, I say."
1,Huh?,"Didn't get it...maybe that was the point of the thing. Anyway, it's more a compilation of songs you'd hear in a 'Music Appreciation 101' class under subject 'esoteric'... very benign, very blah, uninspiring tracks."
2,Far too experimental,"I bought this without hearing it first as I love their previous CD, Moon Safari. Don't make the same mistake. The tracks are more a collection of synthesized sounds that don't fit together, rather than music. Very disappointing."
3,Changing... For the better?,"Air, with their latest album, shows us they can change. 10,000 Hz Legend, the follow up LP to the highly successful Moon Safari shows glimmers of brilliance, but ultimately is not their best work. Like its predecessor 10,000 Hz Legend is a great chill out album. Tracks like ?How does it make you feel? and ?The Vagabond? which features Beck represent what this album could have been. Slightly more electronica, slightly innovative, but ultimately uninspired. If you like Air, you will like this album. If you are a first time Air listener try Moon Safari first."
2,"Air - 10,000 Hz Legend","10,000 Hz Legendisn't as bad as many people would have you believe. It's definitely a change in direction for the French duo. That said, it's not that great either. Tracks like ""Radian"" manage to salvage the album as a whole, but others, like ""Wonder Milky Bitch"" are just awful."
2,Dissapointing,"Premiers Symptomes, Moon Safari - high-quality AIR. 10,000 Hz Legend leaves me guessing. Was dissapointed by their Warfield show also."
3,Feet Foremost aka Shades of Darkness BBC Granda Mystery Thriller,"This British paranormal thriller ""Feet Foremost"" is from the ""Shades of Darkness"" BBC TV Series. Produced by Granada Entertainment for BBC TV. Shown in the US on PBS. The same producers as ""The Maze"",Bright Smiler"", andPoor Girl A Ghost StoryA supernatural mystery thriller. A macabre gothic tale of murder. - A wealthy industrialist and his wife renovate a 14th century mansion that has been empty for 150 years only to learn about the legend of a ghost who haunts the grounds - This is not your ordinary ghost. It is that of a teenage girl who was murdered by her husband before her 17th birthday. She picks her victims by who is closest to death and then takes possession of their bodies until they also die. She kills them from the inside out - Feet Foremost is a sinister suspenseful thriller about a very real ghost! - Color 60 mins."
5,Amazingly intense and rewarding new wave of metal,"I'm a metalhead with a keen liking of bands like Opeth, Meshuggah, Tool, Metallica (the old stuff) etc, ect. I truely believe that this band has influenced metal to a new level.This album has a deeply intense and claustrophobic feel to it, while it at the same time liberates itself completely by subtle technicality and great vision... it is as if metal, punk and hardcore elements has been fused with artistic vision far beyond other contemporary bands. 'Oceanic' is not a display of overly complicated 'math/prog/death' metal skills or anything like that, but the result is somehow far heavier than 90% of the preexisting bands within these genres.An incredibly album... but take your time to get into it. It may not be what you expect at first listen... but it'll slowly grow on you as you starts to drift further and further into the dark oceanic soundscapes."
1,Boring,The book was very informative. I had to get it for a class. I thought it was going to be in a story format but instead it read like a history book.
4,Good battery,This is a good battery - having 2 around made all the difference for me. I had a pair of them for about 4 years (kept them in my garage with its variable temperature) and they finally gave up so I'm getting 2 more. Well worth the money.
2,Payed For New Got Used,"I was quite disappointed with this product. To start, it was shipped via DHL, which is a highly inempt service. Had it been shipped via the Post Office, I would have received it one week earlier. When I finally received the Bubble Machine, the package indicated that it had been previously opened. My suspicions that this product was not new but used were confirmed when I found scratches throught the machine. I am quite angry that I paid for a brand new unit but got a used one instead. I rate the operation of the Bubble Machine as only being marginal. I would definately recommend NOT purchasing this prioduct and NOT using this company."
1,THIS THING SUCKS!,"This machine blows alot of bubbless, but spits solution everywhere!!! It makes any area a ""hazard"". It's horrible for kids or adults. The area where the bubbles were blowing was so slippery that 2 children slipped and fell!! I had to put sand down so no one else would fall!!!! Good idea, Bad Product. Needs fine tuning."
4,Neon Clock,Clock arrived in perfect condition but probably could have been shipped out a day or 2 earlier.
2,was damaged,the cd was covered with a film I could not remove/clean off. Had to throw it away.Was not worth paying the return shipping.
3,Buy it for the artwork,"I have to agree with the editorial reviewers, above. The story disappoints, but the art is exceptional. Note: The page count given above is incorrect. It has 32 pages, not 320."
4,Good as expected,The only thing I would say I did not like was that it was needed a ring adapter on my DMC Z7 and this cause the lens borders appear on picture
1,Disappointed,"Phone is brand new, but the battery for it - it is not even the right one. It is bigger then what it should be and you can tell it is used and old. Dont know for which Nokia phone it is, but it is not for 6061. I just cant believe it that you would send something like that; all the time till now you sent everything brand new. I will buy a new battery, I just wanted to say that I am very disappointed with service this time. It did come real quick, about 7 days or so, but...so sad.O, yea, as soon as I get the new battery I will tell you if the phone is good or not, cos I cant tell right now..."
3,Convenient for yard clean-up,"These collection bags are handy, eary to store and carry a large amount of leaves or prunings. They are a little thin, however, and the handles are sewn on pretty well -- but I don't recommend carrying heavy material (over 10 pounds)."
2,Disappointed,"This was a disappointing book in that it listed very few B & B's in our area, the Southwest. I'm afraid it will see limited use for us."
5,Hot Guys included!,"The movie ""Motocrossed"" was really good. The guys in this movie were extremely hot. Espeically Riley Smith a.k.a Dean talon. I think this movie really motivates people to do stuff they really want. I would want to buy this movie when it comes out!"
5,mello at his best,This Mello album is the best out of the three that I have heard. The beats are amazing same with the lyrics the track Bone Hard Zaggin hits harder than most songs I have ever heard & I can relate to Love dont Love Nobody. I dont Trust Em will always be a classic in my eye & if you get this album if you dont already have it. The whole album will remain a classic to you till the day you die.
5,Great little craft for kids,The stars are easy to make and I used them as rewards for my kids when they were little and then as a prayer star when they were older and could make their own. It is also a good interduction to origami for kids.
1,It was wrth the try,Arrived ont ime and in condition was good. Unfortunately the odor was not to my cat's liking and she stayed far away from it. May work for some but not for Ms. Tulip!
2,Cats are totally unpredictable,"We are not sure if this spray would calm down our cats. We have 8 of them. Some are restless, some are gentle."
3,not sure if it worked,"sprayed the cats' frequently used areas to try to stop the bullying atmosphere of one to another, but it's still going on, so not sure if it had any effect or not"
4,Read this!,"It's very good book but, I think that the end of the book is finished to fast. It would bee good if (Mickey) took the time to give it a proper ,( I don't know how to say this in english so I say ot in swedish) fortsättning! Sorry but have a special meaning in swedish, it's not just the word in it self."
1,Barely Worth It,"Though well written and descriptive, I was forced to drop this book in disgust due to poorly chosen choices for character development. Events near the end left me with a feeling of disappointment in the author's decisions of where to take the book. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who can really connect with the people and happenings in a book, because this one will make you sick. Not even worth the money, or the time."
3,Used steering wheel,"I thought this would be easy to put on since it had already been stretched, but it wasn't that simple and I didn't realize that you should really buy something like a steering wheel cover brand new, because it is used so much it is bound to look worn. Obviously I will have to replace it sooner than later."
2,Not as stated,"We ordered this product because it stated that it would ship in it's original container. It did not. In fact the ""Dewalt"" saw came in a ""Crafstman Drill"" box. This was a gift so obviously we were embarrased."
1,Blah.... yet another typical Hollywood wonder....,"... as in, I wonder why this was produced. Left me with a couple of unsavory images burned into my brain. A complete waste of time!"
1,Last Week's Fish,"SWORDFISH is one of the worst films of recent memory. A cyberheist movie with an overly convoluted and meandering plotline and a few disinteresting hyperpryrotechnic set pieces, this adds yet another project to the list of recent Travolta stinkers.Travolta plays Gabriel, an arrogant self-appointed vigilante who resorts to thieving and the murder of innocents to finance his antiterrorist schemes. Halle Berry is his accomplice. She manages to entice Hugh Jackman, who plays the world's greatest hacker, into working for them by baring her breasts. Jackman's adolescent spastic, drooling reaction is indicative of the maturity level of this film. Not much else can be said. This picture is strictly a throwaway, and the producers should have followed their instincts.As one of the characters says, referencing DOG DAY AFTERNOON, ""It's a morality play. The bad guys can't win."" In SWORDFISH the audience can't win. It's eminently unwatchable."
3,This movie is ok.,This is what passes for an ok American movie. I was a oppurtunity to expose Halle Berry naked and make some good oneliners. Technical government thriller flavored. You be the judge.
2,Swordfish? Worth it?,No. Borrow it for the ten seconds that you want to watch. You know which 10 I speak of.Not worth it.
4,Party Entertainment,"You have to able to take a movie like this for what it's worth. Do not prepare to see this by shutting off the ringer, and closing the blinds, etc... DO however invite a bunch of friends over, get some popcorn, yell at each other to stop talking (but not actually do it), and just have a blast.Swordfish has actors, scenes, effects, and situations that are simply ""cool""! There are scenes that soley exist to have something blow up. There are scenes that were written just to see Halle Berry topless. There are no awards to give out. No pretentious artsy refrences. Just a kick-butt, popcorn, heart accelerating 'flick'! Take it for that and everyone will have a great time!~"
1,watch the opening scene and then turn it off,"This really starts with a bang, the opening scene is very well done, and really blew me away. but what happens afterwards, nothing, every effrot seems to have been made creating the opening scenene, and the rest of the movie tacked on as an afterthought.Theres some really really bad performances notabley from vinnie jones and halle berry, and frankly, i could care less about a brief flash of her soft focus flesh, which seemed to be the main adolescent selling point."
3,Must Own for the Action Fan,"A great action movie. Perfect if your collection includes Steven Segal, Clint Eastwood or Al Pacino.Travolta plays a brilliant (or demented) master mind who has a plan to steal millions of dollars. Halle Berry is a DEA agent hot on his trail (or is she?). Full of action packed sequences and plot twists. Don't miss this one."
1,An almost complete waste of time,"Utter tripe. Glossy, noisy tripe... but still tripe. As so many have said here... you already know it's stupid, but it might even have been worse. I actually watched the alternate endings (God help me) and believe me, the ending they went with was the best of the bunch and that's not saying much.Halle Berry has a very nice body which you will get to see most of, briefly."
4,Hugh Jackman as computernerd,"Maybe it was a conscious decision to cast Wolverine as a computer nerd or it is one of the biggest miscastings that ever happened in movie history. Don't get me wrong, I do like Hugh Jackman a lot, but when he is sitting all pumped up with a biceps like Mr. Schwarzenegger, in front of the PC screens I always have to stop myself from giggling. Enough of the criticism now: The movie is highly entertaining (the hostage sequence in the beginning is something you must have seen to believe it), John Travolta has obviously great fun playing the villain and the movie is always thrilling und does have it's twists and turns to keep things interersting and exciting."
3,Hollywood cliches again,"This is simply another one of those Hollywood excuses to make another action film, featuring big time stars (Travolta and Jackman). This film is not very memorable, there are no orginal action scenes worth noting. In fact, the story appears a bit lame too.Anyone who has seen any of the Lethal Weapon films will have seen this stuff before.I have to wonder why Travolta, man of his ability and reputation, couldn't pick something more challenging for him. Oh well, the sweet smell of commercial success struck again."
1,"Lousy, dumb, stupid Travolta/Berry/Jackman movie","Wow, this was one terrible movie. The gratuitous violence during the car chase was absolutely over-done. The shady characters were typical stereotype thugs. Travolta just was as bad (acting-wise) as he was in The Punisher. In fact, almost a cliche'd carbon-copy.Yeah, yeah, Halle Berry showed her great body to the detriment of some really sorry lines.Hugh Jackman - well I guess I couldn't get past Wolverine hacking into computer networks. The only time I paid any attention to Jackman was when he mentioned the DEC PDP-11; because I used to run that computer in the early 80's.Oh, and Sam Shepard, who played the Senator, really needs to change his one-dimensional characters he portrays in nearly every movie I've seen him in.Bad, bad movie, with too many predictable scenes. But these actors got paid, and that's all that really mattered. Heck, If I got paid for doing a lousy job at work, I [probably] wouldn't care either.....then again maybe NOT."
1,how is it possible this thing has better than 1.5 stars?,"plot holes. obviously rewritten ending to please the post september crowds. laundry list of faults and factual inconsistencies. the worst computer non-sense to hit the screen since the last William Gibson adaptation.it starts strong with a teenage-caliber struggle for philosophy via ""Dog Day Afternoon"" and one of the best produced special effects sequences ever. but quickly breaks into a plodding, trotting, plodding traipse through young punk male fantasies about being able to achieve great feats of hacking while being serviced by hookers. ...P>.anti-social amoral acts suddenly redeemed by the greater good of stealing to a higher moral-ground for murder?hollow, evil heroes for the mindless and skin for the...nice formula. it's pulled in lots of 5 star ratings here so it seems to be exactly what audiences deserve."
4,I liked this movie...,"This movie had bad reviews and I heard that after the opening it all goes down hill, but I liked this movie.Swordfish isn't a traditional action movie. The plot is unique and you don't really know who the bad guys are. You also feel for Stanley (Hugh Jackman) who isn't a bad guy but is getting sucked into committing crimes to save his daughter. True, Halle Berry is naked, but not for long. Its no big deal.While Swordfish isn't worthy of summer blockbuster status, it is still quite entertaining."
1,Far-fetched plot + Bland acting = not worth watching,The plot is so far-fetched it's ridiculous. The acting is insipid. It's not worth watching at all.
2,Just dumb!,"""Swordfish"" was just a stupid movie. The movie was just boring and you knew what was gonna happen. It was trying really hard to be something, but it ended up being nothing but a Matrix wanna-be special effects movie. It's just a waste of time."
2,Bad timing =bad taste,"A lot of people will probably vote this review ""not helpful"" but I'm posting it anyway: Normally I'd give this better-than-averagethriller four stars. However, due to 9/11, this film is now more disturbing than entertaining. I know it had it theatrical run before the war but they should have sat on the video issue for another few months. Or at least re-eddited it. We don't need to see police being blown up or people falling & exploding in a movie when we can see the same things on the news!"
1,Another stupid delivery by Travolta,"This is the kind of movie that serves as an example for picturing the worst Hollywwod has to offer. Ok, sometimes it's good to watch a pop corn brainless movie, but at least we expect some sort of decent screenplay and coherence. This movie has none.The screenplay is a mess. It's a shame to witness Sam Sheppard and Tate Donovan doing absolutely nothing in three minutes of screen time at best...Travolta is at his usual bad performance, the guy is becoming a joke in the movie industry (altough earning a lot of money).Berry's part is also astonishingly stupid for an Oscar winner."
2,Poor movie,Swordfish to me was a disappointment.Poor story and plot all the way through.A waste of money for a DVD.Don't buy it!
5,Add Elizabeth George to my list of favorite authors!,"Elizabeth George is going to be on my ""Favorite Authors"" list from now on. I found myself totally immersed in today's London and surrounding countryside. Her story had me guessing from beginning to end.I was as confused about who the actual murderer was as the characters in the novel and wasn't able to deduce the villian until I was told.Finally, her characters are real people. Those who are evil are portrayed as such. She may give us the reason for their villiany, but doesn't absolve them of guilt. The characters we love have faults, but it just makes us love them more.George is a solid ""10"" on my list"
3,The stupidity of the characters is astounding!!!,"While I normally enjoy George's books, the mother of the kidnapped child is so ridiculously stupid that I found the book hard going. I also found it difficult to believe that a sensible character like Simon St James could be so insensitive to the seriousness of the situation and not alert the police. As for Lynley, instead of apologizing to Simon and Helen for losing his temper, he should have carted them off to jail for their criminally foolish behavior."
2,Logical flaw spoils good book.,"This was my introduction to Elizabeth George and her Linley/Havers series. I found the book to be very suspenseful, but after finishing found what I believe to be a logical flaw in the plot which ruined the overall experience. I did not find any of the characters all that likeable (including Linley/Havers) and found most of the character writing superfluous. I wish I had read the abridged version."
1,WHY??,"I don't get it. Why does anyone like this book? It is so bloated and boring I quit after 200 pages. The characters are totally static. They say the same things again and again. The mother is a total idiot. Then, on page 203 or so, when an entire new cast of characters is introduced, I couldn't believe I was meant to get involved with them, too. Who cares? It's back to Dickens for me. When he introduces a character, there's a reason and the character is fascinating."
2,hmmm Flashlight,"Good for killin critters at nite with an attached flashlite, horrible/unusable for scope. Side mount with quick release lever is better. Don't waste your money on this."
1,AWFUL!!!!,I can't stand this stuff!!!! I don't know what the ingredient is but it is just plain NASTY SMELLING!
4,"Short read, but very true to life",I bought this book because I've had experience in retail and so it interested me. There were more than a few stories here that I could totally relate to from my own experiences. I enjoyed myself reading this book and laughed a few times... I just wished that it was longer. It was very well done though and I would recommend it to anyone who ever found themselves as a sales associate.
5,Eating Right Made Easy,"Dr Steven Pratt has made eating right easy to understand and easy to implement. I normally don't like to read nutrition books but this one I couldn't put down. I now know what I should eat and how big or small the portions should be. Which foods help your heart, eyes, inflamation etc. All the foods he talks about can be found in your local grocery store you don't need to go to a health food store unless you want organic food. If you know nothing about nutrition or know a lot, this is the book for you. He makes it so easy, even adding receipes and daily menus. I hope he will write another book!"
4,$7.99 to take to work,This book has good information for when you are eating outside the home. It makes you think about what you are ordering.
5,This Book Changed My Life,"A few years ago, I knew nothing about nutrition, and this book helped me understand how important nutrition is to our health and overall wellbeing. I have bought this book for several people that I care about, because it really did change my life for the better. This is probably the best book for anyone that wants to get healthy; I have been applying the principles for the past 8 years, and they work. I have extremely low cholesterol and blood pressure, and this is 100% due to the food choices that I make. Everything we eat becomes a part of us, and it is crucial that we consume the nutrients that our bodies need, in order for it to function correctly. I used to eat ice cream sandwiches for breakfast, so this information did not come easily to me; if I could turn my eating habits around, anyone can do it :)"
2,Disappointed,"I suppose if you are new to the whole superfoods theory this might be an okay start. However, I've read too many other good authors' works to have gone through this book and not say anything. The information is dated, at times misleading and inaccurate. I have three of this authors' Superfoods books. I should have bought only one prior to the other two. If you want to truly educate yourself, start with ""The 150 Healthiest Foods on Earth"" by Jonny Bowden, then try ""seasonal food"" by Susannah Blake, ""The Food Substitutions Bible"" by David Joachim and ""the new whole foods encyclopedia"" by Rebecca Wood."
1,Totally Disappointed,"This supposes the new collection in 2009, but only 1 DVD is ""New"". The TOY WORKSHOP is ok (2009 COLOR), but the SNOWY SURPRISE and RUNWAYS are too old. They are 2003/ 2002 version. The pictures and colors are dull and not clear. My son is 2 and he is a big fan of Thomas. He watches Thomas everyday but he rejects these 2 old DVDs!! I dont know why they put 2 old DVDs in this new collection?? and the box outside stated ""2009 COLOR"". Is this a TRICK? Totally disappointed!!!"
5,Loved it!,I had to read this book for a class and loved it. I learned a lot about teaching and ways to improve how I teach math.
1,Cure for Insomnia,"Ma's book would put anyone to sleep. As a student working on a Masters in Special Education, this book was horrible. Basically, Ma compares Chinese teachers to American teachers in the area of Mathematics. She neglects to even mention any cultural differences between the two societies that she is comparing. This alone creates a fallacy for all of the generalizations that Ma makes about teachers from both countries. In summary, this book is long, boring and not worth the paper that it is printed on."
1,Horrible Horrible movie,This movie was really really bad- there were two small parts in the movie that made it funny to at least get some humor- the woman with the knitting needles and the woman sweeping the field. Other than that- this movie is horrible. I couldn't even make it through the whole thing- it just dragged really bad and there was not much in this movie to keep your attention. The direction was very poorly done- the acting was okay. Skip this movie 0.5/5
1,Painful reminder of atrocious cult film acting,"Can't remember seeing a more atrocious example of acting since Cuba Gooding's Direct-to-DVD releases.The producer and director must have recruited every podunk, no-talent actor from the backwaters of ""Trailer-Trash U.S.A."" You do not want to watch any further than the first 10 minutes. Honestly, there are better amateur production ""shorts"" by high school and college-age students on YouTube than this crap.As always, in the early years of ""cult classics"" the acting by the majority of players is nauseating; as they seem to be reading lines from queue cards off the set. This will appeal to those followers of cult films only for the hilarious example of what bad acting and directing can produce. GARBAGE!"
1,I had to be crazy when I rented this movie,"The plot is like many other horror movies when biological weapons went wrong. The acting is below par. The settings and special effects reveal this is a very low budget film. For example, the blood looks very much like ketchup. I did not feel suspensful at all.What a waste of money and time."
1,Substandard sizing,"I ordered a pair for my spouse in his normal size and they were a tad bit to small. so, I went back and ordered the next size up in waist. When they came they were the same waist size as the previous pair but longer. Both pants have the same size for length, so this isn't my ordering mistake. Rather they are several sizes to small!"
4,Watch the sizing!,"The waist sizing is the only thing that there may be a slight problem with as in what I call american jean, they may seem to run a little small. The length is great. Material is very soft and yet well made, not thin at all. Would be a great work jean. Money well spent!"
5,Excelent,"very good product of a brand that has an international reputation for an incredible price, quality, price unsurpassed by any other similar product.."
5,Work jeans,My husband is a carpenter/contractor and these are good heavy wieght jeans that won't wear out after just a few days on a roof.
3,Searching for the Post-Cold War Devil,"There is no question about LeCarre's writing. With The Spy Who Came in From the Cold and Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy, he sealed a place for himself as our preeminent espionage writer, if not as one of the 20th. century's great scribes. However, The Night Manager clearly misses a proper villain. Roper, the arms dealer funneling guns to every wrong-headed cause in both hemispheres, seems a bit too conjured. Still, it's no fault of LeCarre's; his superb tradecraft remains in fine form. The poor fellow simply lives in an age suffering from a terrible deficit of mystique. It is as if Mata Hari had dropped her last veil, revealing a rather common face."
5,His best,"I'm shocked to see all these dismal reviews for ""The night manager"". I read it 4 years ago and still vividly remember the characters. I found it to be a huge, powerful work that I can wholeheartedly recommend to anyone. One of my all-time favorites. Highly Recommended!"
1,Simply doesn't work,"Trying to share my Canon S520 between a Linux box (Suse 10.0) and a Windows XP box using IPP (TCP/IP) and SMB. Neither one works more than 15% of the time. No new firmware since 2005. Seems that Harking also gave up on this print server. Too bad. It looked like it had such potential, but the darned thing just doesn't work."
2,Too limited to keep,"I had high hopes of sharing my Canon i850 printer, and the Hawking H-PS1U seemed to be the USB answer. Alas performance did not measure up to its looks. One, it was very, very slow. Two, it would not allow full bi-directional communication back to the computer. Three, it operated very hot. Did I say it was slow?One email contact to tech support containing four questions brought no response. Another finally brought a minimal answer - disable bi-directional capability. No, I said, I need that capability, and if a user has to disable a feature he/she paid for to use your device, your product is deficient. A third email returned one more answer - the server meets thermal targets. A fourth and final email generated the most comprehensive answer, repeating earlier instructions but still not addressing all my questions.So, if it does what you need, the Hawking is fine. If it doesn't, don't count on tech support for much help."
4,A Memory Book That Shapes the Present,Brueggemann invites readers to Scripture study as a feast that can transform. He presents the Bible as a memory book that gives us an identity and promises a future. It is never a closed book of past events.I found the ideas presented in this book life giving. Each chapter closes with reflection questions for discussion and a meditation that connects the points from the chapter to scripture and to life.It is challenging reading and for best results share the reflections with others.Most interesting for me was that the Bible is not an answer book but a book that asks questions. In the process of living in those questions our perception of life changes. The Bible is meant to be life changing.
4,Funny and touching,"I enjoyed this movie very much. I don't feel that movies need to reflect reality 100%.. Anybody in the bear community has probably experienced some of the stereotypes in this movie and that is fine with me, it is what makes the movie so enjoyable, I have no problem laughing at myself. Good acting, bad acting aside, in the end, I enjoyed it immensely."
5,Big Bear-Y Barrel of Fun!,"One of the best directed, acted and written independent gay comedies I have ever seen. This film provides us with the quality look of a Hollywood produced film but none of the hangups of making it 'suitable' for straight audiences....this is a gay film for a gay or gay-friendly audience, the way all gay films should be made.The actors are wonderful, and the story is solid, a feel good gay film that is believable, you couldn't ask for more.5 STARS! Can't wait for Bear City 2!"
1,Depressing and terrible!,"A horrible and depressing portrayal of everything that is superficial, cliche, and stereotypical about the gay (and bear) community. I can't help but wonder if this movie was produced by a bunch of bear hating homophobes, they did the gay community and bear community a disservice with this crap!"
5,"Great, simple film","Solid, simple story. Sometimes predictable, but it shows a good bit about the American way bears live their life as part of the diverse faces of gay people. It is fun and really recommendable. Just be careful to whom you would recommend it, considering the edited-yet-absolutely-present sex scenes."
4,Quite a thorough investigation into postmodernism,"Lots of seminal pieces. My only real complaint is that the font is just so small that it makes reading difficult. I suppose without making it into two tomes, there is no other way to get around the small font. Thankfully, the pages are split into two columns so I didn't get lost between lines. Cahoone has added some helpful commentary."
5,Was my favorite book as a Child.,"My mother used to read the stories from this book to me at bedtime. This was one of my favorite books as a child. I have sense used the later printings of this book for my children and grand children. It is a compilation of many different works including selections from Aesop, Tales of Brer Rabbit, and other Classics. If you need just one book for bedtime stories, this is a great choice to get a wide variety of writing styles and story telling. I highly recommend this book to any parent or grandparent."
5,Love this book,I brought this book when it was published in 1992 for my first born. I love the illustrations and so does our son and although the book is battered now he still treasures this book both for the memories it invokes and the incredible illustrations. I now buy this book as a shower present for nearly everyone I know.
2,Not for my dog!,My dog had it 5 minutes and had ripped a hole in the plastic. Thought it would be more durable. Would not recommend to a dog that likes to chew. Very disapointed.
5,USB cables to Go,"Worked perfectly with no hassles. CD drives were included, received product within 5 days of purchase. Highly recommended."
3,Cables To Go 39979 6ft JetLan USB 2.0 Networking/Data Transfer Cable,"This product was good, not to slow. Transfer was moderate could have been faster, but it depends on the size of files being transferred."
4,Great accessory: Needs Driver Update,I got this cable to share two laptops w one internet connection until I could get the wireless up. Cable works great once you download the update network driver from the corp website!
2,Shame that material from our article not properly attributed.,I and several authors ( including Drs. Elizabeth and Ron Weller) reviewed the German literature rather extensively on querulousness (querulanten)in children and published such an article about characteristics. It is a shame these authors almost lifted some of our findings verbatim without citing us as a reference. I can assure you that translating Gothic German is no easy matter. See Google for the refernce. Sheridan G. Tucker MD
5,A Deeper Understanding,"This book spoke to my heart. After suffering the horrible loss of 3 children through miscarriage...this book helped me gain perspective and a better understanding of the Sovereignty of God. It started me on the road to recovery. Of course, the holes left in my heart from those losses will never be filled...this book helped me look at where I needed to grow in my relationship with the Lord, as well as, how I could minister to others suffering from the same type of loss."
5,5 Stars,"What an amazing album. Full of highs and lows of love and hope. Highlights include ""While I Was Waiting For You"", ""Her"", and ""Horoscope"". A must for any modern country fan."
4,Good book for list people,"I bought the pregnancy organizer because I really like having lists and being organized. This book does exactly that and is really helpful, you do need a separate book though if you need more substance."
3,Think twice if you have 703 saw,"DeWalt claims the DW7080 is also right for the 703 saw, but as with the reviewer with the 706 saw, it does not slide into the base of a 703. I feel this detracts greatly from the usefulness of the unit. Also, the ""self-tapping"" screws that secure the extension to the saw base are very poor. One screw went in with a GREAT deal of effort, the other I could not get in far enough to clamp down on the rod it is supposed to retain. Anybody have a Torx driver with a breaker bar on it? It otherwise is a well constructed unit. Go for it if you have a 708 saw and a T-30 driver w/mechanical advantage."
2,OK if Mounted Permanently,"These extension wings will be fine if you want them permanently mounted on your saw. I returned them because they are not easily removeable for saw storage. My Hitachi saw has similar wings that slide in and out with one top mounted set screw, the Dewalt requires mounting from beneath the saw and are not made to install and remove readily, so I returned the items.I decided on the Porter-Cable PC136MS Universal Mobile Miter Stand for my DW716 miter saw. The Porter-Cable stand is well worth the money and Amazon has is for less than I paid and shipping is free. The stand is excellent. I also used separate roller stands for support for my 20-foot long 2x8's I was cutting."
4,REMEMBERANCE OF A LEGEND,"I was very pleased with my latest puchase of Stanley Turrentine. I had been a long time since I had heard his music, and having the pleasure of hearing it again was well worth the wait."
1,NOT THE THEO VAN GOGH FILM OF THE SAME NAME,"NOT THE THEO VAN GOGH FILM NARATED BY HIRSI ALI OF THE SAME NAME ....this has been reported to Amazon but it is still link to searches for Theo Van Gogh and Hirsi Aki.....Come on Amazon, you usually do a good job, get it straight with this. Thanks."
2,A Panic Merchant's rush to publish.,"Sadly, one with as much exposure as Ms. Schiavo, gives into the Dark Side. It is true that we can do much to improve commercial air safety in this country. It is also true, however, that our (U.S.) air safety record is the best on the planet. Often, by orders of magnitude. No other country even comes CLOSE. Moreover, there's never been a better record in the entire history of aviation. As such, it was unnecessary for Ms. Schiavo to panic (not a recommended character trait for any pilot). The only value of this publication is as rally call to AIM for perfection in aviation. That's it. Else, if you're looking to learn, look elsewhere: this book wreaks of gross inaccuracies of both technical and administrative nature -- only further testimony of Ms. Sciavo's self-serving rush-to-publish on the tails of the Summer of 1996 commercial aviation accidents."
3,"Interesting info, but Very poorly organized","This book has lots of info on flying and safety -- as one would hope from the former Inspector General of the Dept of Transportation -- but it's very poorly organized. Her gripes about petty bureaucracy are intermingled with stories about how she learned to fly which are tangled with stories of herself as a commercial passenger, and somewhere almost lost in there is the information about the deficiencies in the equipment and operations used in commercial air travel. In the chapter on safe landings, for example, she slaloms into gripes about FAA managers misusing free air tickets. Toward the end, she advises passengers on which ""Airline Safety Rule"" to cite, but no mention of where these are found in the Code of Fed Regs or statutes. What we basically have here is a good first draft of a book that needs to be strongly edited (organized) into something readable -- something that can be referred to without thumbing through 357 pages."
5,Very good overview,"This book is better than these reviews let on. It is true that the book is not a happy look at Hamann's work, but Berlin is no dummy. He has read Hamann and for those of us who would appreciate Hamann's Lutheran hedonism, he doesn't spoil it. Through the cracks one can see and understand Hamann's work through Berlin's lucid and warm style. I loved this book, even though the one or two notes about how he led to Kafka, surrealism, and Nazism, were not well thought-out.Berlin's Judaism, and the whole Luther to Hitler idea, seem to have allowed from some not very well critiqued notions. Hamann knew Hebrew very well, and has many many positive things to say about the OT. But Berlin couldn't help but give him a whack.I really enjoyed this book. I couldn't put it down in spite of its flaws."
1,DeWalt DW7053 Dust Bag,"After purchasing and installing the dust bag I noticed that it didn't matter whether I had the bag on or not, the amount of dust spewing from the saw was the same. Luckily I purchased this bag from a local building supply store that guarantees satisfaction on anything they sell."
2,Forget it. Hook up your vacuum!,"I don't know why anyone still uses these things. Everyone owns a vacuum, and if the nozzle doesn't match up perfectly we all know how to use duct tape.Some people get the bag to work; others have problems. But in the end it's the guys with the vacuum hooked up to it that end up walking away with little or no cleanup!If you lost it and are looking to replace it, forget it and go buy a new blade with the money you save."
3,Lexmark All-inOne,Sirs;I purchased this for the first one and rate it with a 3 because of that fact. I use it occasionally but do enjoy it.
4,Hidden gem of their discography,"I always loved the Blood Brothers' Crimes and Young Machetes. Then I began to look backward into their catalogue of albums, like Burn, Piano Island, Burn! Their earlier stuff rarely got any play on my iPod but as the years pass by without this great band, I've began to listen to even older records. Recently I've been listening to This Adultery is Ripe, although it is less polished, it is a great ride! it just takes a few listens to get used to but it is worth it. This album has so much raw energy. It's just great. If you need a Blood Bro's fix, I recommend this album. I just wish more indie bands these days had this much potential."
4,Good for most of the basics,"I am a homeowner looking at installing around 900 square feet of pre-finished hardwood flooring. I'm also an amateur woodworker and reasonably handy around the house.This DVD covers most of the basics of laying unfinished hardwood floors. While many of the techniques will apply to pre-finished floors, some will not. Pre-finished floors have other considerations that must be taken in to mind, such as covering up blind-nailings along the edge, handling height differences without sanding, use of different (pre-finished-friendly) floor nailers etc.Overall, I thought this was a good DVD with a lot of great information. I recommend it for folks like me who need to see something in action as opposed to just looking at static pictures in a book or on the net. It won't be enough to answer all your questions, however."
4,Dewalt Saw blade,"I like the thin kerf blade for my table saw. It uses less horsepower, creates less waste, and has a good clean cut."
2,"Not up a patch on ""Exile""","After seeing A3 (Alabama 3) live, I just had to buy the ""Exile"" album. That album is upbeat, ironic, funny, in-your-face and musical --- in a ""sweet, pretty, country, acid-house music"" kind of way.When ""La Peste"" was released, I also had to buy it.Unfortunately, its style is more commercial and laid-back than the energetic ""Exile"". I was quite disappointed. Most of the album seems to be an attempt to hold onto the mass-market audience that they grabbed with the theme tune from ""The Sopranos"" (first series)."
4,So far So good,"I've built this saw into where my old radial saw used to live in my professional woodshop, but easy enough to take to a job site for framing. It's relatively smooth and quiet, does all it's supposed to do, but I have twice made the oh-so-easy mistake of doing a compound cut without sliding the tall fence clear. The second time it tore the fence right out of the slot. BANG! I was digging aluminum shrapnel out of my throat, and ruminating over a brand new but ruined 12x80 Dimar blade. I suppose the good thing is the saw still works ok after some slight adjustments, so it isn't too weak in the arm, but it would be nice if they could figure out how to avoid this risk, and improve the dust pickup."
5,Fine for homeowners,"I bought this and a dewalt table saw under the pretense of making fine furniture someday. Five years later, that day has not come. However, for around the house repair, building a 12' pine shelf for a kid's room. Chopping up replacement boards for crappy builder-supplied cabinetry, cutting 2x4s for a shop bench, trimming outside lengths for a shelf in the nursery, cutting scrap wood into usable lengths, etc... this saw has been fantastic.I see a lot of bad reviews from obvious furniture makers who require thousand of an inch tolerances... I have no idea how this saw applies to you guys, but I'll trust that I'll need a new one if I really get serious with expensive wood.But for the joe-schmoe homeowner that just wants to graduate up from a skill-saw and some saw horses, this unit rocks. I even built a workbench around it with 8' feed tables. Perfectly happy with this purchase."
1,Not the precision of the Hitachi,"I like the design of the DW708 handle and the stacked rail system. However, the motor is so loud and the gears do not seem to be well made. Also oil drips when in use. And the saw blade is poor quality and needed to be upgraded for my first project. Hitachi still makes the best miter saws."
3,too much $ for too little product,"The only good part of this saw is the miter table. The rest is over kill and loose and poorly designed. Hitachi makes a better and smoother saw with constant power under load, more standard accessories and less expensive blades for the same cutting capacity. Dewalt's fence hits the motor or worse the blade on some cuts; there's no reason for this. I returned the dewalt and went back to my hitachi c10fs."
5,Excellent book.,"I have read a lot of Holt's books, but this is one of the best. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in schooling, education, and providing children and teens with quality experience. As a public school teacher, I can say every word in this rings with sheer brilliance. I disagree that school can cause injury or damage, but I do agree that the hours, years in school could be spent much more fruitfully, authentically, and enjoyably."
1,Cropped and choice of Chinese or English dubbed no subtitles,"This looks like it could be a fun movie. It has Jackie as a rich master who tricks a warrior with magical powers into fighting his evil wife and her 4 magical bodyguards.Unfortunately the presentation totally ruins the movie. The opening credits are presented in the correct 2.35 aspect ratio, but immediately afterwards, the picture reverts to a panned and scanned image that ruins the fight scenes, which are the only reason to buy the disc to begin with.On top of that, unless you're a Chinese speaker, you have to settle for an English dubbed version with no subtitles or closed captioning. Considering the capabilities DVD possess for including multiple sets of subtitles and languages, this is most disappointing. END"
2,Way too small,"I brought this item for a 3 year old and it doesnt fit at all, It more for a 1-2 year old."
2,Not a lot of action as expected from the preview,"I have never seen the original so I cannot make comparisons. For me, it was slow. There was not enough action and everyone spoke in such low monotones it was frustrating. I watched it on The Hallmark Movie Channel because it DID have Lou Diamond Phillips and I have liked the westerns he has done in the past. The romance part (small that it was) had some tender moments and the two actors did a convincing job of it but there was not enough to the whole movie to want to watch it again."
1,DeWalt DW7050 Extension Kit,"This item is ridiculously overpriced... for a couple ofbucks worth of metal made in Taiwan -- a real consumer rip-off.DeWalt/Black & Decker, the manufacturer, should be ashamed of itself. Unfortunately, it's the only extension that works with DeWalt chop saws, if you want an extension that will attach to the saw. My recommendation: Don't buy it!"
3,A little bit confusing......,"This book was a little bit confusing to follow. I understood that he was a holocaust survivor, and it was sad what he went through. I didn't like how the author left it up too us when he got hit by the taxi. Did he do it on purpose or was it just an accident?This book did give me a better prespective on what life was like for the survivors and how much suffering they went though after the holocaust. I thought this book was ok."
3,The Accident,"This book was about a young Journalist named Eliezer who steps off a curb into a speeding taxicabs path. It leaves you thinking if it were an accident or an attempt at suicide because of a terrible past he had. There was plenty of times in the book where i didnt get what was going on. It was a well written book though. I think if i would of read Dawn and Night, the other two books of the triology with The Accident, i would of had a better idea of where Elie Wiesel was coming from. I didn't know this book was part of a trilogy, but now that i know i would like to read the other two to have more of an idea of the character's past."
2,I am a huge Hank Williams fan....but,"This CD is not very good. I do like Sheryl Crow's version of Long Gone Lonsesome Blues, and Tom Petty's version of ""You're Gonna Change."" Of course, Johnny Cash is a good choice for tribute. I find it hard to justify leaving Hank Williams Jr. off of here. To be honest I have never heard of Keb' Mo', or Beck.I would recommend people who have never heard Hank to stay away from this. A lot of it sounds nothing like anything Hank would have done.A better tribute to the best singer ever would include COUNTRY music stars. That would include Toby Keith, Travis Tritt, Randy Travis, etc."
2,A Bit Dissappointed,"Bought the album based on others reviews. Hank Williams songs just aren't the same when sung by someone else. Newer renditions certainly sound better, quality wise, as opposed to an old scratchy vinyl. I guess I am just a purist and appreciate the originals as opposed to Bob Dylan or Keith Richards version."
4,The best way to cut Crown molding.,Stops work fine for cutting crown molding so you don't have to cope inside corners. The stops fit fine but are over-priced.
1,Save your money,If you think that you actually need these things then you probably need more skills not more tools. I found them to be awkward to work with (especially when working with several moldings at once) and completely unnecessary.
3,not satsified,book was in good conidtion but it took FOREVER to recieve the book in the mail..I was not pleased with the shipping process
2,Not a true best of,"This album is not the sampling you will want from this band. Where is ""The World Is A Ghetto?"" If it's a sampler you are looking for, pick up the 2 CD set that is out there and leave this one alone. Better yet, get the individual albums. They are better than any best of collection you can pick up by this band."
5,best music i have ever heard,"this music is funky and real. the artist lyrics are about issues that we can relate to, dance to, and just sit back and relax to"
4,Engaging show but needs subtitles for those streaming video,"Season 2 picks up from the conclusion of the first series, which was an engaging detective series with the quirky, though occasionally tiresome, twist of Luther's continuing battle with the young murderess, Alice Morgan.But if there was ever a show that needed the benefit of subtitles for non-native (American) listeners, Luther is it. Every episode includes several scenes with important dialog that was indecipherable to my ear. As I remember, the banter in the headquarters was often the hardest to understand. Too bad that Amazon's streaming service doesn't provide subtitles. Nevertheless, looking forward to watching more of Luther Season 2."
5,Dark and smart,"Idris Elba in a role that could only be played by him. Smart, gripping, and dark. As someone who lived in London I can say this show captures the (sometimes) gloominess of the city perfectly and uses it to the advantage of the story line."
4,He's the man.,"Not quite as good as ist season, but miles ahead of anything of it's type done in the good old USA."
4,Luther!,"Idris Elba is pretty amazing in this series, just the right mix of angst and heart. The only problem is that it's too short! Four episodes. I wanted so much more."
5,Great,"love them and do the job fantastic, is also a nice size for samll dogs besides that it has an excellent price"
3,Poorly executed,"With a storyline that has so much promise, and as a tribute to the father of its genre (chambera/jidai-geki), I found this version of Ronin Gai to be both weak and disappointing. The editing and camera-work were dull, close ups that were cried out for failed to materialize, the incidental music was irrelevent, and characterizations while promising, never attained their potential."
3,Many mistake..,There are many mistakes in this book and the author is not good in explanation the important details.
3,not bad,I enjoy the comfort of the unit is great...when it stays in position. I didn't order it for the built in vibrator but it was nice until it died on my second road trip.
3,Dewalt Clamp,Well made clamp but too expensive for what it does. A short bar clamp works just as well and has many other uses than the one function Dewalt.
1,Lemon deluxe,"My Dewalt DW788 arrived from Amazon, and would not work whatsoever. Advise steering clear of this brand, and buy locallywhere customer relations are more important."
4,somewhat misleading,Picture suggest that the shirt comes with tie & cumber bun. It does not.Shirt was fantastic. Prompt & excellent service.
5,Really amazing album,"What cany I say? PAINT is an all round amazing album. Highlights include: Yep! (ft DJ Drez), Heavyweights Vol.4, Stop Biting (tight Rob the Viking production), Dawning of the AGE (ft. Grouch), and probably the most amazing song on the album: A Coat Of Pain (Finale). Ab's writes are so humble, yet ring so true. I find this quite unprecedented in today's hip-hop culture.It's time this talented MC got the attention he most defintely deserves. Go check out:Mood Pieces, South Central Thynk Tank, A-Team etc.I think the album is on Battle Axe... anyways, go cop it"
4,"This is a banger, you can't go wrong with this","I gripped ""P.A.I.N.T."" a few days ago, and from beginning to end it's a great project. Abstract Rude did the Hip Hop nation justice with his latest. Very introspective and humble from my perspective. With all the thuggin' and pimpin' going on in the music, it's good to see some artists respect the artform and continue to elevate it. He has all the underground all-stars on here, Moka Only, Grouch, Eyedea, Slug, and many of the Project Blowed MCs. Just go grip it."
5,hip hop's finest,"P.A.I.N.T gets five stars because anyone can pick up this album and appreciate abstarct rudes skills. After listening to it a few times you will probably get addicted and end up with all his other titles. Heavyweights 4 is a standout track on this album for me and it displays the skills of the freestyle fellowship. Other standout tracks for me are: a coat of paint,stop bitin,and frisbee.if your just gettin started in hip hop i think this is a goos place to start. Some other titles to look into would be Aceyalone,Accepted ecleptic and who framed the a team?"
3,Dont Cha 1 CD,"Gave it to my son, but don't know if he liked it or not. My son also likes the Pussycat Dolls and got this Don't Cha 1 CD, one of mine and his favorite songs."
4,IT'S COOL YOU WONT BE SORRY UNLESS YOU DONT LIKE THIS SONG !,THEY HAVE A FEW COPY'S OF THIS SONG SOME EDIT FOR RADIO A FEW VERSIONS OUT THERE SO BE CARFUL THE COVERS ARE IN OTHER COLORS THAT MIGHT HELP SAME BACK GROUND SOME IMPORTS ALSO BUT A GOOD BUY AT ANY RATE !
2,for fans...,"Not the best OST Ryuichi did, but the bolerish (a personnal vision of Ravel's bolero) is interesting and sounds really good (quite live with a classical orchestra).If you like Ryuichi OST's, I think you'll like it as I did."
1,Thanks for identifying what I already knew.,The author has an innate knowledge of surrealistic holography that transcends the space time continuum. Bottom line: he has no clue.
4,"Generally excellent, but marred by lots of typos","This book is an extremely valuable discussion of a variety of topics about the C language that are poorly described in other books, ranging from how to read complicated typedefs to how your C program compiles and runs on the computer. The material on C++ is quite dated (the book dates from 1994). However, the most annoying thing is the large number of typos. There is a whole figure missing on one page, and there are numerous smaller typos (mostly obvious) throughout the text. There are two big errata sheets on the author's web site for previous editions, but many of these were not fixed in the most recent edition either. My advice to the author: hire a competent proofreader. Also, readers should note that the author's offer to pay $1 for mistakes in the book reported to him DOES NOT apply to typos, only to technical corrections."
3,"OK, but terribly overrated. Definitely nothing expert","Too much hype about this book. I bought it online a few years back -- because of this hype; it's very basic; I regret I bought it. Not that it's bad: for a beginner in may be OK. In any case, make sure to check it out in store; don't buy sight unseen."
3,"Expert on C, not expert on programming in C","This book helps you on the way of becoming an expert on the C programming language, it is not much help for the purpose of becoming an expert on programming in C.What's the difference? Well, on the dimension from language lawyer to poet, this book falls more on the lawyerish side. In the same way that grammatically correct sentences in a natural language are rarely great poetry, so correct C programs are not necessarily great programs. Correctness is necessary, yes, but hardly sufficient.Van der Linden has little to say (or if he has, he doesn't tell) about topics such as good style at a small scale and doesn't at all touch how to structure programs at the large scale. Things like how to avoid name clashes, structure header files, handle errors, avoid resource leaks.The C programming language is still very much alive, and as far as I can tell, the place on the shelf for a book on C Patterns & Idioms is still vacant, waiting to be filled."
4,"Good book, a little out dated","Book has some good info and tactics in it. However, it is outdated. Also, it does a little plugging for certain items. I could have done with out that, in fact I just skipped those chapters. It is a good book and worthy of an addition to you hunting library."
5,A Great Place to Start,"I'll be hunting turkey for the first time this spring and found this book full of useful ideas and strategies. Interesting and informative, it retained my interest like a good novel."
5,Purchase this Bible!,Out of the 5 study bibles I own this is the one I refer to the most. Outstanding articles on the foundations of the Reformed Protestant Faith. The notes are insightfull and devotional in nature.Regardless of your theological persuasion you will find this Bible helpfull in your clear understanting of Reformed Protestantism.
5,Very good coffee,"I have had this coffee maker for over 1 year. it has been very good to me. Never has broken or given me a bad cup of coffee. There are many adjustments you can make to get the type of coffeee you want. Love everything about it. Grinds your coffee, easy to clean, easy to maintaine. If your looking for a very good, value priced capresso maker this is the one."
1,Weak Coffee,"Nice looking machine but after two years of trying every kind of coffee and setting, we have come to the conclusion that this machine just makes very weak coffee period. We're finally dumping it. Since Williams and sonoma also deleted this line from their sales, I guess we are not the only ones that had problems with its performance"
4,If you're serious about living in Japan,"I lived in Japan for one year as an exchange student, and plan to go back after graduating college. That's why I picked up this book.This book is loaded with information, and references to other places to find information as well. The book has tons of weblinks, and email addresses of organizations to help you out once you get abroad.The book is very real, and is NOT a tourist book. It covers topics such as taxes, how to rent apartments, how to get your car overseas, why NOT to bring your car overseas, marriage issues, employement issues, and everything.This is a good book for the person who intends to spend an extended amount of time in Japan."
5,GREAT!,I left a disc in a car I sold and was happy that I could replace it so easily and inexpensively.
2,Poor 2nd place entry,"Great expectations as presented is entertaining but does not fulfill the potential of the first, (original film) and as such is not worth purchase and viewing. Buy the orig inal if you can get it ? ""All the right moves, perhaps T. Cruise' all time bottom. Save you money, nothing viewed, nothing missed !"
5,buy this or any other flower kings,"The Flower Kings are keeping the flame of progressive rock burning brightly! An amazing band with amazing musicianship. If anyone thought that progressive rock had seen it's better days (a.k.a. the seventies), they would be best served by playing a disc by this band. Buy, listen, enjoy..you'll want the entire catalogue"
3,This goes nowhere,"There's absolutely nothing new here. It's just an extension of Flower Power - which was too long to begin with. None of the tracks stand out, there's no audible passion or inspired lunacy or even originality. Yes, there are some progressive ""hooks"", but the whole thing seems... formulaic! As if FK have identified a recipe and stuck to it. This album is so disappointing it makes me question the excitement I felt when I heard Flower Kings for the first time on Space Revolver. Was it really that exciting and new - or was it just new to ME? It occurs to me that if progressive rock was popular fiction, the Flower Kings are becoming Stephen King - if they aren't him already.The music isn't bad or anything - which is the only reason why I still give the album 3 stars. But it still ""feels"" like 2 stars."
1,Waste of Time,"I have been trading stocks and options for some time now. I found this book to be relatively boring and also a little mis-informative. The book provides a ""Master Plan"", however as a trader who has worked with sound trading plans, I found this one to be a little inadequate. Aside from format, it does not differentiate between a $5 move for a $12 or a $120 stock. There is insufficient information on signal identification as well as strike rate. This makes it potentially dangerous for new traders. Anyone using this system should thoroughly backtest before putting any real money on the line, to make sure you understand it.You can always learn something from every book, and this one is no exception. However I did not find that my knowledge of swing trading was increased through a simplified presentation of the process. As with many books that offer to enlighten you, the amount of enlightenment is often less than you would like."
1,dont bother.,"Basic stuff. Swing trading explained for 10year olds.Your money would be better spent on Larry Swing's E book ""A practicalguide to swing trading""."
3,Useful information,re: magnets & ghosts. . . . I usually shy away from the 'paranormal' mysteries but Abby seems more normal than 'para' - especially compared to her family! I do enjoy this series and this entry in particular as my mom grew up near Detroit during WWII and it was interesting to get another little view of what it might have been like there and then.
4,I would recommend this one,"Having read another book in this series,Better Read Than Dead,I ordered this one.The Author has chosen an interesting character,Abby Cooper,a psychic who in this installmentalong with her sister and a freind buys a fixer-upperhouse which turns out to be haunted.has a good story lineand characters.i will eventually read the other books in the series."
5,WORKHORSE,"BOUGHT THIS SAW PROBALLY 12 YEARS AGO STILL PERFORMS LIKE THE DAY I BOUGHT IT. IT'S SEEN SOME HARD USE AND SOME HARD FALLS. TAKES A LICKIN, JUST LIKE A TIMEX. THIS SAW IS ONLY 13 AMPS THE NEWER ONES ARE 15 SO YOU JUST CANT GO WRONG WITH THE DW364."
4,Great saw with great adjustability.,"I bought this saw over 10 years ago, as soon as DeWalt released it. At the time it was the gold standard of sidewinders and in many ways it still is. I love the adjustability: super fast and accurate depth adjustment (the front knob and rear pivot is brilliant DeWalt!), fast, smooth and accurate angle adjustment. While the base was an improvement over most saws of it's time, it has been surpassed by cast bases such as Bosch's, and I'd like to see DeWalt put a better base on this saw. Mine has not stayed flat. If they did that, and perhaps boosted the amperage a bit, it would be as perfect as a sidewinder gets.Chris[..]"
1,Bad quality product,"I enjoyed the movie, however the quality of the DVD was very poor. Over half of the DVD seemed like it was recorded over something else because it kept flickering and blue screening and freezing. The last half hour was fine though. Very disappointed as this was my first purchase from Amazon."
1,vulgar ... waste of money,"The only reason this DVD got a ""one"" was because they do not give the option of zero or negative number ratings. This is one of the worse movies I have ever attempted to see (I say ""attempted"" because I took it out after 20 minutes!). The language and theme is true gutter. I cannot understand anyone giving this a good review. The only thing I can imagine is they have a vested interest in the good rating ... maybe they have some to sell and write a good review just to get rid of them. Don't waste your money."
4,Daddy & Them,"Having been a long-time fan of Billy Bob Thornton's movies & John Prine's music, I was excited when I heard that they played brothers in this movie, & HAD to have it!It's about a family so dysfunctional, they make the Bundys & Simpsons look like the Cleavers (Leave it to Beaver). Andy Griffith, in a departure from his usual 'good ol' boy' roles, plays the father with a severe communication problem, which is passed down to his boys.Laura Dern is adorable as Billy Bob's wife, trying to keep their marriage afloat, despite the fact that her sister happens to be her hubby's ex-girlfriend.Jim Varney makes his last screen appearance as the uncle, in jail, who brings the family together in an attempt to bail him out.Several other rcognizable actors & actresses have smaller roles in this movie, & though it's a bit awkward at times, it's an entertaining ride that leads to a decent ending."
3,Just O.K.,"It gets the job done, but for my buisness it was a lot of extra pages I did not use. It is easy to use. Good for small buisness."
3,womens chaco flip,"the shoe was ok. it just wasnt as comfortable as i expected. it was my mistake though, not on the part of the shoe or the company."
5,Best Flip flop ever!,This sandal has what no other flip flop has --- support! Great arch support and comfortable foot bed. Doesn't get any better than this!
2,UNRELIABLE ERASER,"I've had this eraser for about a year, after my old and durable Koh-I_Nor burned out. I really wanted to believe this would be a great product, but it stinks. First of all, the chuck ring never stays in place, making heavy duty erasing impossible. I am constantly pulling the eraser out, only to see it pushed in again while erasing. I try to tape the chuck in place, but that doesn't last either. Second, the motor is not as fast and powerful as my old Koh-I-Nor which lasted me forever through thousands of drawings. The charge isn't as strong as when plugged in, but I need to use it ""wire-free"" for it to be worthwhile. I think I paid around 85 bucks for this piece of junk. Buy a different one."
2,Poor Reproduction,"This is a reproduction of the original book written by A. J. Grout before 1923. It was reproduced by Nabu Public Domain Reprints, and includes the following disclaimer in the beginning of the book:""This book may have occasional imperfections such as missing or blurred pages, poor pictures, errant marks, etc. that were either part of the original artrifact, or were introduced by the scanning process...""The book is highly illustrated which is an important feature in identifying mosses. Perhaps 5-10% of the illustrations are blurred or missing. In addition smaller type which is used to describe the illustrations and also used in the keys are sometimes difficult or impossible to read."
5,de Gier and the commisaris do America.,"I don't even care much for mysteries but this onecaught my eye while in a physical bookstore looking for the new Burke novel by Andrew Vachss. The book is interesting because the characters are real; this one gives a peculiarly Dutch perspective on American culture, which at times is laugh-out-loud funny, like de Gier, in his eternally curious cop mode, wondering why on earth anyone would buy bags of ice."
3,lotsa ocr typos,"So... great story told by a great author.If it were a print edition, I would have gone to the brick and mortar store and asked for my money back.It seems the publisher didn't spend much time proof-reading the electronic edition. They scanned it and ran a spell-checker on it. After 50 ocr-related typos I gave up counting, and that was less than half way through the book.It knocks me out of the flow of the story when I have to figure out what a word is supposed to be, so that definitely reduced my overall enjoyment.Too bad."
3,bad condition but good price,Great price but the book is not in a good condition. Most pages has a lot of hand writings in red and its very hard to use the book.
4,A must read for any Akita fan,"This is an excellent book for anyone who has an interest in the breed. The author includes a great deal of health information that is extremely dry reading. I felt this information would have been more properly included in a book specifically about that topic (it takes up about 30% of the book). This would have allowed space for other, more interesting information to be included. That complaint aside, I would highly recommend this book, especially at the price it is available on Amazon."
2,Very disappointing,"Good concept, title, and cover... but lacking good pictures. Any most pictures are very small. Lots of good writing, though."
5,"Cute, Fun, Why not?",I think this is a very educational toy. It's fun cute but only for ages 4&up. Why not buy it? Only $9.99
4,Does the Job,I used this product at work for several years and then had to buy one for home when I had to do a stint from home. The foot pedal I used at the office probably lasted me 4-5 years before it broke.
1,Not a good one,The headset is very uncomfortable and the footpedal will not work with the program I need it for. I've been transcribing for 31 years and I am not happy about this product at all.
4,Good,"Great in a pinch, but a bit runny. I still prefer fresh but again it's good and nutritional when you are love on time."
5,Must See,Really well done and a good eye opener for the harm we are doing. I had NO idea this is what we do with honey bees and was a great educational movie for the kids.
3,bees,"was o.k. but kind of boring. Facts were great, but lost interest halfway through, even though learned some important facts."
3,DEWALT DW364 7-1/4-Inch Heavy Duty Circular Saw,I believe this dewalt circular saw is a fine product. I had to file the piece of the metal frame that contacts the metal base so that I could adjustthe blade square with the base. the problem that I still have is that the left side of the base is straight but the right side is distorted (caused when they stamped the hole in the base for the blade). this will not work if I want the saw to follow a guide for cutting sheet goods. The saw has all the nessary adjustment points. I really shouldn't have to modifythe saw to get what I need. dewalt makes a good product and with the way things are I doubt that I would do better if I bought from some other company.
3,Tidbits you won't get anywhere else!,"As a piece of historical gossip this one takes the cake. Anyone familiar with the Gilded Age knows that it can be hard to find a first person account of the times with enough information to fully flesh out the real life Kings and Queens of this impossibly rich enclave. Mrs. Drexel Lehr (who's beautiful Boldini portrait, which does her much more justice than her photograph, now hangs at The Elms in Newport, RI) was born to a life that will never be seen again in America. If she seems to be snobbish, why tis par for the course for a member of ""The Four Hundred."" Read this one for realistic portrayals of Astors and other leaders of American Society, but remember to temper your twenty-first century perspective! Darlings, things were different then! Suggested reading for more goodies: To Marry An English Lord by Gail MacColl & Carol McD. Wallace and Fortunes's Children: The Fall of the House of Vanderbilt by Arthur T. Vanderbilt II"
3,Scenes from the Life of St. Francis,Describtions in this book were too depressing and austere for modern reading.
5,2nd purchase after 8 years of GREAT popcorn,"This is the 2nd purchase of a Whirley-Pop. I've gotten spoiled by how good it is because movie theater popcorn tastes gross to me now -(strange coating on tonge). I pop my own and smuggle it in. The recipes that come with it are also fabulous. My family likes the ""Sweet Touch"" recipe that adds 4 tablespoons of sugar to the oil, popcorn and salt."
4,Whirley-popper,The popper arrived quickly and the box was in good shape. There is something about the clips that hold the lid on that is not adjusted ideally. Initially the lid wouldn't go on without interfering with the stirring device. After correcting that by flattening the lid where it was slightly sprung it worked well until I tipped the popper over to empty it. Then the pot fell off the lid. More attention to detail seems to have overcome this as well. This type of popper is the best I have ever had based on my experience with my prior whirley popper. The lid troubles are new on this most recent purchase. I expect it will now do very well.
2,At least the crew was enjoying it.,"He or she who made this must be very ashamed. What a piece of !@#$%^The DVD I received was a home burned one on a Verbatim DVD-R. The title page said the DVD contains a 'Bronze wedding'. Perhaps I would have enjoyed that better. The inlay was printed on a bubblejet printer on A4-sized paper and they used a very low resolution picture.And don't get me started on video and especially audio. Editing was poor and I was really shocked that someone actually spent some time on audio post-production and during that time never noticed that all his switches were flipped to 'bypass'.At least the crew was enjoying the shoot. I knew they had a great time during training and the actual flight, but seeing they're still having great fun made me smile.Save your money and pick another title from this site. If you've seen this one you won't be disapointed."
2,Not worth it!,"Typical of Dewalt accessories, this item is grossly over-priced. It is made of thin metal and I never got a sense of precision when I installed this on my Dewalt 12"" compound miter saw."
1,CROWN STOPS,"The web site that Amazon.com has, says that the Dewalt DW7054 and the DW705 are compatible. They are not!! I've contacted Dewalt Customer Services, spoke to three people with little or no help. They were going to check into it and get back to me, but they never did. I called back and spoke to a Supervisor, with no response as well. He was going to get back to me within 48 hours---that was almost 2 weeks ago. Yes, I did buy the Crown Stop that everyone says will work, but it doesn't.Very disappointed with Dewalt Customer Services."
3,"Well made, kills my back and shoulders","This Carrier is a good idea, well made, and easy to put on, but frankly i can't wear it for more than 5 minutes with my 3 and a half month old. Also when she faces out (she's looking around now and doen't want to face in anymore and has great head control) the material pinches her legs. I'd say if you don't have back problems it's great. I will say the mesh material washes well.The way it works is fantastic... face in the baby's head is cradled for when they are newborn, and face out the flap folds down to brace the shoulders. I just can't wear it. Grandma and Dad tried it too and they had the same problem. Back pain within 5 mins.I also tried the PeanutShell carrier and forget it, being lopsided (over the shoulder) my back lost it right away.I'm going to try Moby next... we shall see!"
3,like the bijorn,I was pretty pleased with this particular bijorn it defiently serves its purpose however i do have one complaint about it and its the same complaint most people have it hurts my back about 10 mins. after I put it on. so i do suggest getting the one with back support. otherwise I like it and so does my baby..
4,Its ok,I wish the baby had more room for his arms & baby gets ill putting him in but once I finally put him in it he calms down
5,Love it!,I absolutely love this baby carrier and so does the baby. I have a 2 year old and a newborn. The carrier keeps the baby cool and I can barely feel that he's with me. I am very happy I went with this product.
3,...but no photos,"I would have liked this book except that there were no photographs; I really need to see some examples of the finished product. Otherwise, the book seems fairly helpful."
5,Useful for understanding how to plan a sweater,"After reading this book at the library, I got a copy for my own. This book has useful history and descriptions. It helps me understand how to read complicated knitting patterns, and how to plan my own sweater designs."
3,Coats & Clark Read Heart Baby Econo yarn Candy Print Pompadour,I chose this rateing because this yarn was not what I concidered to be a baby weight yarn. It is too heavy and bulky for the projects that I am working on. The colors are very lovely. I like them alot. I would have loved to have used this yarn if it was a baby weight yarn as it is called. I recomend this yarn for heavier projects possibly for an older child. I'll save it for another project at another time.
2,"Comprehensive, but poorly executed","This bibliography of baseball fiction is exhaustive, and helpful, however, the format has many defects, and listings contact too many errors for a reference work."
5,Footlight Parade,"Considered by many the Marx Brothers' greatest film, ""Duck Soup"" remains must-viewing. Even if your children are too young to catch all the rapid-fire dialogue, they're sure to enjoy the physical humor and prevailing sense of anarchy. On one level a biting denunciation of war and fascism, the movie also stands as one of the screen's top comedies."
4,Great Musical,"A wonderful musical. The three Busby Berkely numbers that end the movie are spectacular, but what makes this film so wonderful is the incredible non-stop patter and the natural acting of Cagney and Blondell. (Keeler is also lovely, even though she may not have been a great actress). While most musical movies happen in a neverland place, this at least try to put itself in its particular time and place (the Great Depression). There's a freshness in the movie that you don't see in flicks today, much less in the usually stilted 30s films, even though the plot, involving the setting up of movies prologues, is quite dated. And check the homage to FDR in one of the musicals."
3,Sleepy historical trance,"With the proliferation of electronic 'genres', it seems safest to characterize this album this way: 'If you loved Phaedra, you'll like Musique Mechanique.' While that statement lets you know what sort of music you're in for, it may not be strictly true. Apart from a few brilliant moments on ""Depature from the Northern Wasteland,"" (by M. Hoenig - he's a master of building dramatic tension within the ambient format), the album generally maintains a very low musical profile. Its various hums, drones, and somber keyboards evoke, if anything, the sense of religious immanence that the baroque period symbolized with the empty fifth interval.This is all well and good, especially if one is in a meditative mood, but there is little here to engage the forebrain. So, if you're ordering a copy, break out the candles, incense, lava lamp, mandala, and that paper with the little blue stars printed on it."
2,Not as good as expected.,I chose this sander based upon a review in Consumer Reports which ranked it #2 (behind a Craftsman sander). The dust bag is not worth using. I could never keep it attached. The vibration from the sander would constantly cause it to fall off. I bought an adapter for my shop vac which mostly fixed the dust extraction issues. Another problem is that the sander bogs down significantly when performing heavy sanding duties. DeWalt's quality seems to be constantly falling. I wish I had bought the Craftsman sander instead.
2,Surprisingly not all that good,"I purchased the Dewalt because their tools are historically of good quality. This sander does not seem to take too much off even if you use 80 grit paper (my little mouse sander does better job) and as for other features, I agree with the others that the dust port keeps falling off and the switch is suspect. But my variable speed option still works though. After using it on a project for about 20 hours, the bearings went and I had to get it fixed. Once this sander quits on me, I think I'll opt for the Porter Cable."
1,"JUNK,JUNK,JUNK","I PURCHASED THIS SANDER 1/3/03 AS AN ADDITION TO MY MAKITA'S. THOUGHT THE VARIABLE SPEED AND THE PAD BRAKE WOULD BE A BONUS OVER MY OLD MAKITA'S. WHILE USING IT THIS PAST WEEKEND,I STARTED TO SMELL THAT BURNT MOTOR SMELL, THE DUST BAG WOULD FALL OFF AFTER JUST A FEW SECONDS-FINALLY ENDED UP JUST LAYING ON THE FLOOR-THEN THE PAD FLEW OFF ACROSS THE SHOP AND HIT THE WALL. DUG MY OLD MAKITA OUT AND FINISHED THE JOB. ALL THIS HAPPENED IN ABOUT A 3 MONTH TIME SPAN AND ONLY 2 1/2 PROJECTS. WHAT A PIECE OF JUNK!!!NO, IT WAS NEVER DROPPED AND I AM VERY EASY ON MY TOOLS. ALL I CAN SAY IS THAT I'M GOING BACK TO MAKITA AND WILL STAY WITH THEM."
2,Beautiful Watch but then the part holding the strap to the watch broke!!!,"I really loved this watch...very stylish and modern...perfectly said by the other reviewer. but then, the part that holds the strap to the watch broke and I couldn't get it repaired. So much for the style if you can't use it and it's not cheap too!!! It's 85 bucks! I've only used it for 4 months!!!"
3,disappointed,this book is basically a pretty overview of ideas. i expected to see more information on how to construct arbors and or trellises. there were also too many pages devoted to climbing plants for the arbors.
2,Not as good as it should be.,"I am very disappointed in Gun Digest Book of the AR-15 Vol 2. I found volume 1 enjoyable and informative, however volume 2 is neither of these. My main impression from reading the book is that it was thrown together in a hurry just to get it published. The topics of the chapters are presented with very little detailed information being given.I have read other books and many magazine articles by Patrick Sweeney and know he is very knowledgeable and usually is able to give the reader useful information in a way that is enjoyable and easy to understand. However, this book falls well short of his normal standards."
2,Volume One was much better.,"I found Vol 1 well written and very informative. However, this volume reads like it was rushed to capitalize on the success of Vol. 1. I would try other AR-15 books first. Try Volume 1. If you really need something new buy it, but do not expect it to be as well written as volume one."
5,Long search is over,"I have spent hours in shoe stores and online looking for a shoe that looks comfortable and stylish while remaining functional. My long search is finally over. This shoe is fantastic. The heel is just enough to add some boost and help keep the shoe on your foot (a big help with no back ankle strap) while the multiple straps look stylish and also help keep the shoe on your foot. With the sand dune color, they made the visible part of the sole brown, a nice blend of colors. I am so impressed, I have added multiple colors to my wish list of the same shoe."
3,good but not all that and a bag of chips!,hey this pad is good it is pretty much non-slip but it is not all that and a bag of chips
3,"okay, but not great","I got this mat as part of a package deal with DDR Max 2. It worked fine for about 7 months of continuous use on the beginner and light levels of the game. After that time, the bottom arrow stopped registering and doesn't work at all now. I think it was from folding the mat, even though I was very careful to fold it the right way. I don't recommend folding it because it seems to make the sensors less responsive. One other thing - the mat does slide a little on carpets."
2,Not made to last,I bought this pad about 3 months ago and it already has about 8 rips in it. This might be good for a beginner but it will not last. I had never played this game when I bought this and after using it for about 3 hours a week and it is totally destroyed. Right now the buttons don't work most of the time. And when you are playing harder songs it tends to slip around a lot. If you want a pad that will last you longer you can get one for about $50. Overall I was very disappointed in the quality of this beat pad. I suggest paying about $20 More and getting one that will last you a lot longer.
2,Theres better pads out there...,"My friend went on a vaction this summer and he came back with two of these pads and DDR Max for his PS2. We played alot when he got back but one thing kept bugging me! Im a little on the short side and i had trouble hitting the back arrow on these pads, plus these pads have an annoying way of sliding EVERYWHERE on good carpet! if your starting out playing DDR i recomend Intec's line of DDR dance mats, there smaller and they dont slide like these ones do."
1,any console games,"Games from the US dont work onBritish spec machines,it sucks .Why is this i would bye loads, butthay just dont work, stupid."
3,"Not great, but the only game in town?","The quality seems OK at first glance, but I had some problems pop up. The floor mysteriously leaks. Also, I found the stake loops used to hold the tent down can rip off if you pull it to tight. Unfortunately, I am not aware of another storage tent that is fully enclosed. Thus, I decided to order another and repair the previous one.My advise is to be very gentle and to be ready to make repairs if needed. Also, assembly is quite a chore, and requires two people.But on the other hand, I'm glad these tents are available because the alternative is drowning in a sea of useless junk!"
1,"Annoying, unreliable, and potentially dangerous","If I were trying to design the worst smoke alarm that I could possibly think of, I would make one that goes off at 3:38 am with an annoyingly loud voice that says ""EMERGENCY! EVACUATE! EVACUATE!"". Eventually, the homeowner would disconnect the stupid thing. Then he could have a smoke alarm that seemed to protect his family, but is actually just an empty ugly disk on the ceiling. If I were really good, I could design it so that its batteries would always run low at 3:38 am also, causing an annoying voice announcement and a set of beeps to go off every 30 seconds. But if I were a REAL genius, I would make sure that every new building permit required that these annoying, unreliable, and potentially unsafe devices be installed inside every bedroom and in every hallway. But I would have to be a government employee to be that clever. Instead, maybe I should just design a toilet that requires multiple flushes to save water."
5,Smoke/Carbon Monoxide Alarm,"Great alarm. Simple to install, simple to test. Something to use to be safe. Buy it and you won't be sorry."
5,Easy Installation,"My husband purchased these, said they were easy to install, and easy to use. Satisfied customer. I definatly would recomend!"
4,JoeE,"I bought two of the combo units and and four standard smoke detectors as upgrades for my 11 year old units. I thought the mounting ring was going to be exactly the same but no problem, loosen the two mounting screws, exchange the mounting ring, plug them in and mount the unit and you're done. All has gone well, thus far. No smoke, no alarms or the annoying chirp, which is why I replaced them. There was no need to do any touch-up painting as the rings are approximately the same size as the old units.The shock to me was how quickly they arrived. They were delivered before I thought, hey, better check to see if they are in route. Seriously, this is the kind of product you don't want to hear working. The green led is a tad more visible at night then the other units were and I only noticed that on a late night bathroom run. Really, I hope they work fine, they tested ok, but I hope they never have to work."
2,poor quality,keeps having to be replaced after every two to three years....cost lots of money when you have 5 of these in the house to replace at the same time
4,Satisfied,The 3 units I ordered installed easily and have worked well in the past 2 months. No problems. I still have 4 more to replace.
3,eats batteries,since I've gotten this productI've replaced the battery 3 times (in 5 weeks)Not sure if I have a dud or simply bad batteries
5,Successful replacement of 4120,"I was a little antsy about upgrading from 3 old 4120'sto the SC9120B after reading all the reviews with notesabout bad ones or false alarms... but I went for it anyway.All three tested good right out of the box, the instructionswere good and matched instructions in several reviews.Took about 3 minutes per alarm to replace for the first two- pop the old one off - remove and replace the bezel - popthe new one in.The last one was older and had a broken wire, so I replacedthe wiring harness with the new one (supplied). It took about10 minutes for that one.Five days now - no false alarms - no beeping in the night."
2,Unsure on reliability of this product,"These were installed and wired in ""new construction"" over two years ago. Since I have been plagued with frequent beeping indicating battery need changing. Changed battery and item continued to beep. I have replace three of the five units in my home. Replacing the item has worked. If this happens once more I will have all smoke/carbon monoxide detectors removed and replaced ""with another brand""....."
3,ramdom failures,had to return three of them due to defective units. It is a great idea but reliability is questionable. check out others
1,Not Reliable - Junk,I have other First Alert hard wired smoke detectors in home. All work fine. I purchased this one with the carbon monoxide detector. First the battery compartment is almost impossible to know if battery is set in correctly. I had to take the whole unit apart. But before taking apart the unit just plain broke after a few months. Unit kept beeping. Changed battery. Changed battery again. Beep. Beep. Beep. Poorly designed. This is now an expensive toss away. Opening the battery compartment is not intuitive. Stay away from this one.
3,Yet to be proven,I have had this in place only two months and already haveing problems. Drains battery very quickly. I will give it some more time. Perhaps were bad new batteries.
3,Why??,"The detector is ok. Not too fancy, easy to install. Just wish it would have come with all the stuff you to install. Had to make a run to the hardware to get some butt coinnectors. For a few pennies, they could have put 3 in the box."
1,Wrong Item Sent,"I purchased these items, but the seller sent the BRK Carbon Monoxide detector not the combination detector........I contacted the seller, who stated he would send a return UPS label and have UPS pick up the incorrect items.........However to this date I still am waiting for the labels....and he did not have the correct items to send in their place.......However he did immediately credit my acct..........I just wish he would send the return label so i could send these items back....."
1,A total waste of money,"This book is a waste of money for whomever buys it, a waste of paper, totally useless and offers absolutely no useful info beyond what any reasonable person does not know. The writer merely lives on a parked boat and might as well live in a cramped apartment from where he can write the same worthless stuff. There are no ""essentials"" in the book. Believe me, go spend your money somewhere else!Dutch West."
4,Useful intro for someone new to boat ownership AND living aboard,"This was a helpful book as I was purchasing my first boat, and planning for it to be a liveaboard at the same time -- to know what to expect, and to get familiar with many of the terms, equipment, things to think about, etc. related to boats. It is slightly more oriented toward sailboats and east coast, being where the author is from, but still useful for power boats and even a few tidbits about where I am (Seattle). However, there was a bit of erroneous info, that it takes 3 hours to get through the Ballard locks and out to sea from Lake Union... maybe on the 4th of July, but other times nowhere near that much."
1,Plot? Premise? Dialog?,"I have to admit that I haven't read the other books in this series.If this is representative, then I am glad that haven't wasted my money on them.I read books to experience someone else's view of the world around us. The heartbreak, ecstasy, life, romance, and love. This book only qualifies if you are satisfied with a view that is limited to two sets of eyes, pizza, and sex.If the book were a hundred pages long you're buying 97.5 pages of sex, .5 pages of dog, one page of family, and one page of Marine Corps.Mr. Michael has written several other books that I have enjoyed but this is definitely not one of that group."
1,pathetic!,"tedious book. Badly structured. Translation from German is ABOMINABLE! Do not even bother getting it. A shame, a shame that this is academic!!"
5,Shabbat Shalom!,"We very much enjoy listening to this music on Shabbat...Or anytime. We know the songs & words, to most, however, the tunes are tweaked & original. Very upbeat!"
1,A poor piece of writing,"I'm sorry. This book has nothing going for it. None of the characters are believable. The story line is simplistic. It is writing by the numbers. Again, I was fortunate to have been given this book to read by a friend, but he did me no favors and so I am using this space to deliver that message to those who want to know whether they should shell out good hard cash to buy this book. Don't. The message is just that simple."
2,Page turner,"Not painful. The pages keep turning. But ho hum...This book has some promise in the beginning. I thought I was going to learn something new. But, alas, the author was only interested in writing action (yawn). I don't know if he bothered to research the interesting intricacies of finance and technology or just decided the reader wasn't interested. Wrong guess. Why can't we get some Tom Clancyish detail here? Now that'd be fun."
2,A murder per minute,"Having read Frey's previous books and enjoying them all, I was disappointed by his latest effort. It was difficult to suspend disbelief as the silly and contrived plot unfolded. Paranoia about our political leaders and cynicism about the power of money in the political system are natural subjects for thrillers, but even the dumbest and most credulous members of the media would have figured something was up as the body count rose in this book. Frey's narrative and prose are not his strong point and the weakness of the story led him knock somebody off every time the suspense flagged. His obsession with plot twists and placing characters in physical danger became tedious and while I finished the book quickly, toward the end I was skimming to get to the end. I was surprised to see a good story teller write such an amateurish book."
5,A must-have for teachers and schools,"The best tool I've found for assessing reading. With previous measures, I've been able to find an accurate reading level for my students. These tools - especially the CORE Phonics assessment - help me to pinpoint the exact strengths and weaknesses."
5,great product!,my expectations were exceded so much! the product was in great condition and arrived ahead of time! thanks so much! i will definitely come to you first if i need another vinyl.
5,Fits my Kindle too,"I just got this bag after seeing it in a store (wrong color there though). Fitting my stuff it seems about perfect size. For the most part all I want to carry is my phone, a small wallet, keys, and if possible my kindle (in its amazon cover, though it may not need it in there). This size fits exactly that. Its got great storage without being bulky."
5,Fela Rules!!!!,"The Fela in Concert DVD was a fantastic find. My only complaint is that it wasn't long enough (1hr in length). However, I couldn't stop dancing around in my living room to Fela's infectious ""AfroBeat""."
1,Arithmetician about Supposed Mysteries,"Books giving voice to anthroposophy awfully vary in quality. Some of them are revelatory and inspiring; they encourage to independent thinking (e. g. M. Scaligero, G. Kühlewind, O. Barfield, C. Bamford). Charles S. Tidball humbly serve authorities. The book is full of quotations and commentaries. Somebody thought thru Christian Mysteries, even only dreamed of them, and Dr. Tidball conveyed it to us. Tidball aided by Powell brings lengthy calculations of alleged exact dates of Jesus Christ earthly life. Many details, no compelling evidence. And absolutely no connection between numerous words and contemporary spiritual (and social) crisis."
4,Dewalt DW6913 Router Edge Guide,"Great product, my only complaint is there were no instructions included but then again it's pretty easy to figure out."
3,Good material about one of the causes of heart disease,"The author goes into great detail describing the benefits of having a low homocysteine level in your blood. He says that you need to eat foods that contain sufficient levels of B-6, B-12, and folic acid. These nutrients lower the homocysteine in your blood.So, he makes a good case that a high homocysteine level is not good for your heart health.However, the book does have contradictory advice. I just opened to page 203 and read where he says to eat whole eggs. But in one of the recipes he has you combining one egg yolk with four egg whites. He also says to drink whole milk but one of his recipes calls for skim milk. Maybe the recipes need the ingredients in that form so that the finished product has the right consistency. But you see what I mean, it does make it confusing when trying to remember the right foods to eat."
5,Winnie Mae,"""Over - produced"", my Aunt Ida! This book kicks major bootie, for kids & parent-folk alike! My local library should be so prudent, as to have this lusciously illustrated vignette in their collection (which they *don't*, but I intend to donate!). The author/illustrator is a true craftsman, & we can all benefit from his heartfelt philosophy. (...)"
2,Dust Bag Issue,"I purchased this belt sander about 5 months ago and found that it lives up to the product claims and design with one basic flaw, the dust bag. As you can imagine, a belt sander removes material aggressively and wood dust is the obvious byproduct.It didn't take me long to realize that none of the dust was being directed into the bag and perhaps this is due to a design flaw if in fact the designers gave this feature any thought. On the good side, you never have to empty the dust bag because it has no function since all dust is left on the work piece or shot into the air for potential breathing.If dust collection is a concern of yours, perhaps a different model or manufacturer would better suit your need."
1,belt sander,"The dust colecter does not work at all. Will not pick any dust. I will not use it again. Own other DeWalt tools that are good, but this one is JUNK."
5,Just Great,What better action figure for a little boy than a good guy who's tough (meaning durable). Jake Justice rides a motorcylce with a battering ram. This toy is excellent for stimulating the imagaination for little boys. This hero provides hours of fun for little boys of all ages.
3,Packaging is the Problem,The order was received in a prompt fashion and was sold at a good price. The Jig saw blades were packaged in a nice clear soft plastic case that would make keeping them organized easier except for one problem. The description of the Items in the package is written across the clear plastic in 3 languages. In fact there is so much writing on the clear front of the soft Plastic that it makes it difficult to see the blades in the plastic display
4,"Good, but not his best","I love the way Stephenson writes... but this book is my least favorite of all of his books.His idea of a Neo-Victorian age is an interesting one, but considering the idea of the first Victorian age makes me cringe and lose all interest in anything being discussed about it... moving that into the future and mimicing it, but with a dystopic and dirtied mechanical/electronic version of it doesn't exactly excite me either.There were a bunch of interesting parts in this book, and overall it is enjoyable. But I personally had a hard time getting past all the Neo-Victorian sludge.I personally enjoy Stephenson and will always read everything he publishes, but with this type of book, he always seems to come off as ""Gibson Lite"" to me."
3,Great concept and vision - poor execution,"I just finished reading The Diamond Age and I'm a bit conflicted. The world laid out by Stephenson is original and compelling, especially if you're interested in the future of nanotechnology. But to be honest, I almost gave up on this book twice. At times the narrative moves slow and lacks direction. Some of the most interesting characters are exhaustively introduced only to never hear from them again (the confucian Judge and his staff for example). While I'm glad that I stuck it out and finished this rather long novel, it's unfortunate that the narrative never really caught up with the potential of Stephenson's brilliantly envisioned future."
2,Stephenson can't put the pieces together,"Not coming anywhere close to being as good as Stephenson's masterpiece ""Snow Crash"" nor his excellent ""Cryptonomicon,"" this is a book that's filled with some great ideas that never come together as a decent book. Stephenson frequently seems like he's completely uninterested in telling a good or even readable story, and is more concerned with sounding clever or urbane (i.e. wizened on Eastern culture). There aren't any characters here worth caring about, there's a world that's too complex to bother paying attention to, and a climax that's intense but seems to come out of a separate book."
3,"Great Beginings, Unresolved endings",I really liked 95% of Snow Crash and 85% of Diamond Age but his endings are terrible. Things are left unexplained and unresolved. I won't read another of his books unless he learns to write an ending.
5,Great Sci-Fi,"The Diamond Age definitely lived up to the expectations I had after reading Snow Crash. There were plenty of original ideas, an exciting and interesting plot line and of course it was written in the authors undeniably awesome style.I could see how some people might be annoyed by the way some things are left up the imagination of the reader but I don't think it makes the book less enjoyable. The ending comes abruptly after the climax but it does resolve all the major story lines. I guess some people were expecting it to end with ""and they lived happily ever after"" but I was satisfied with where the author chose to leave off."
5,sf at its best,"This is the second novel I read by this author (the first one is Snow Crash). Just as I expected I find it filled with wonderful and original world building, some interesting insights on history, culture and philosophy (in this case Chinese Confucianism, Victorian Britain and debates on the philosophical issues of AI), and is a well written story while not treating itself too seriously. Also in my opinion its characterization is even better than SC. It has some nice insights on education and the evolution of values in a society, as well as the social impact of technology, in the end it reminds us that after all it is love and compassion that can really change our lives and make us human."
3,Overrated with a very unsatisfying conlusion,"I read the Diamond Age after reading Joe Haldeman's Forever War and Orson Scott Card's Ender's Game back to back. In comparison, the Diamond Age seemed hollow and contrived. There was no effort to create characters capable of genuine emotion, and there was no resolution. Actually, I was unclear to what the whole point of the story was. Was it that great minds will create revolutionary technologies no matter what the consequences? That Chinese really dislike westerners? What was the central conflict even? Some of the hard sci-fi was interesting (though over-relied upon) and the Diamond Age is fast paced, but on an emotional and philosophical level, I was very unsatisfied"
4,Interesting idea but a bit too long,I really liked the idea behind this book and I do see more and more of it coming to be reality as time goes on. However the book really lost me in the end.
5,Nanotechnology before it was popular,"This is a great book that will stick with you for years to come. Mr. Stephenson was writing about nanotechnology and its potential influence on the world years before anyone had really heard about 'nanotechnology'. Few authors have the ability to integrate science, technology and the future into a compelling storyline as does Mr. Stephenson.Regardless of your interest in science and/or technology, this book is well worth a read."
1,"A real stinker. Starts out strong, then limps home sick.","I loved Snow Crash, so it was with extreme optimism that I started in on The Diamond Age. The first third of the book was great! Then it was as if someone else took over the writing of it. Nothing made much sense, what did was contrived, annoying, and worse boring. I couldn't wait to get to the end of the book. I kept thinking ""it's got to get better"" but it didn't. If I could give it less than one star on this system, I would. Save your money."
2,Does this guy ever finish a book....,"Nano-plot is a pretty apt description. And it is executed flawlessly in this sloppily written slice of futurama.The setup is great.The setting is imaginative and well crafted.The problem is that there is not much of a story here. Consequently the author must not really feel compelled to conclude it.For example: Stephenson spends the first 40 pages developing a bit character that is abruptly killed off, but he has no qualms about concluding the whole book in about 5 pages...in the middle of some battle no less.Read the first few chapters - you'll get all of the good techie stuff without the time commitment necessary for the big let- down, er ending."
3,"so many words, so little plot","There is a lot of interesting thought here, but it seemed more like a draft than a finished work. Still, entertaining enough."
1,Vile,The wet Net? Seriously? I found this book to be vile instead of provocative. Do not waste your time or your money.
4,Savage Courtship by Susan Napier,"Description from the book back cover:Vanessa could kick herself! It had been a simple misunderstanding ... how dared Benedict Savage imply that she'd deliberately set out to seduce him? The very idea was outrageous; he simply wasn't her type! No matter that he was the last word in cool, suave sophistication -- he was also her boss, and a formidable sexual predator into the bargain. But Vanessa had no intention of falling prey to his dark charm - had Benedict met his match at last...?"
5,Have all his Cd's...!!!!,Very incredible man...!!! Freefalling and Tablet Of Ahmadare tearjerkers!!!!!This man is definately for adults also!!!Top notch inspirational Michael Crawford-ish tenor--Gives me Goosebumps---Tablet Of Ahmad - you MUST get it!!! ITS RED IN RARE FORM!!YOU WILL NOT BE SORRY....
1,NO CONTAINER!!!,One of the main features of why I purchased this was because of the black container that I saw on the thumbnails preview of this item. I believe it is falsely advertised and want a container! Nibs everywhere!
1,DON'T BUY THIS JUNK,"I BOUGHT TWO OF THESE SWING ARM LAMPS. THEY WEREN'T THE CHEAPEST AVAILABLE, BUT I THOUGHT THAT I WAS BUYING SOMETHING SERVICEABLE THAT WOULD SERVE THE PURPOSE I HAD FOR THEM. UNFORTUNATELY, THEY WERE THE CHEESIEST, POOREST QUALITY THINGS THAT I HAVE BOUGHT IN MY MEMORY. I LATER BOUGHT A SIMILAR LAMP FROM HOME DEPOT FOR THE SAME PRICE WHOSE QUALITY WAS FAR BETTER. I WOULD HAVE RETURNED THE LAMPS, BUT DIDN'T WANT TO GO THROUGH THE TROUBLE AND AGGRAVATION INVOLVED. THE ONE LAMP I DID INSTALL IS PRACTICALLY FALLING OFF THE WALL NOW,TWO MONTHS LATER."
2,GOING IN THE TRASH!!,"This is the worst Rescue Hero accessory! The windshield pops off and won't stay back on, the helicopter blades do the same thing and now finally the pullstring has broken. It is going to the garbage as we speak. Otherwise, we LOVE Rescue Heroes!"
2,Falling Heroes,"I purchased this Item for my nephews after purchasing it for my own son ,in which he didn't recieve his at all After reviewing it and hearing the complaints of my nephews that the heroes would fall out when helicopter is move right or left.Unlike the jet it doesn't have somewhere to plug the heroes in for security or protection of falling out. The jet is wonderful, the helicopter just needs a plug, than it too will be a great toy.I'm waiting for it to be made better ,than I too will repurchase this item."
2,PLASTIC RING PROBLEM,"The sander is a fine product, with the exception of the ""controlled finish system"". This system uses a plastic ring which wears out rather quickly. When I bought the sander another ring was supplied, which I've misplaced. I am now stuck with a sander that works improperly, shoots shards of this plastic ring out, and I cannot seem to get a new ring for it. Lifespan was 1 month of heavy use. My boss has a porter-cable and it doesn't have this system. It seems to work well without and has had a year of daily use."
4,Great Little Sander!!,"I love this sander. From the time I took it out of the box to do a home renovation project to the time I took it off and cleaned it four hours later I have been pleased. Ladies if you want a powerful sander that has a good grip to it, this is the one for you. I had no trouble holding on to it. The only problem I had was the dust collection bag kept slipping at intervals, other than that I'm looking forward to and inventing projects for my sander."
2,only one drawback,"I purchased this sander new from Home Depot and used it. After a (in my opinion) brief amount of time, the loops let go. There was no accident, or misuse of the sander, they just gave out and refused to hold the paper. Another reviewer said 50 sheets. That sounds about right. I too was dissappointed that I had to purchase a $20 replacement pad/loop part. I considered the Rigid brand when the HD employee told me they stand behind their sanders for the life of the sander. To do over,I'd purchase the Rigid sander."
1,"Two Design Flaws - One Little, One Big","This unit didn't last long on the job site. The on-off switch is tiny and its action finicky, but the real problem lies in the dust collection system. The plastic slider-on adapter accepts either the included collection bag or vacuum hoses of various sizes. So far so good. But when the running sander is applied to the work surface, the adapter vibrates off within five seconds. DeWalt needs to rework this pronto."
3,Dust Bag,This is a great sander BUT the dust bag has come apart twice. Dewalt has replaced it both times but a fix to the problem would be nice.I use it to sand out door furniture & it works great. Terry
3,Writing Magic,"I thought writing magic was a very good book but that it was meant more for younger kids. The advice was useful for writing stories and it was really cool to learn how to write from my favorite author. If you are in 3rd, 4th, 5th, and even 6th or 7th grade i would highly recommend this book if you are interested in being a writer. I would still recomend this book to older people but wouldn't base everything i write on it."
4,Sarted on the first pull!,Started on the first pull! Impressive. My only complaint with design is that the tiller has to be literally dragged in reverse. This is tough on the rough concrete in our shed where space is very limited and I have to park it with the engine against the wall. Pulling the drive wheel pins is one solution but highly impractical. Would advise checking that all bolts are tight. One of the four bolts holding the entire frame to the transmission was very loose.
2,Not An ICP Holiday,"The worst of ICP I'd say. It's rare though, so it's straight. Annoying in a way, but good for the x-mas season. Only for Juggalo's."
3,"good, but wouldn't buy",These are two really good christmas songs by ICP. The songs themselves would both earn 5 stars but its really pointless to buy this when both of them are on Forgotten Freshness 1+2. But if you have the extra money it'd be cool to show it off I guess.
1,Doo-doo,"He is a talented guitar player but that doesn't mean he can play the blues! Sorry. The singing is too weak to comment on. He'll get better, but this is strictly cotton candy."
5,How I Became a Better Perl Programmer,"I've been programming Perl for over 10 years. I started to read On Lisp recently (though I've had to stop for a few weeks while I finish an ""emergency"" project) and the book has already changed my Perl programming style completely. Even though the book is not about Perl and even though I'm only half-way though the book, my programming techniques have evolved so significantly that my programs are about 1/10 the length of what they used to be, they are easier to debug, and far more enjoyable to program."
5,More to love,As I have said in other reviews i love these books. I can't think of one criticism. The whole series is superb. Not one bad book in the bunch. Ultimate read for anyone
1,Shame on Amazon for selling refurbished as new.,"My Company ordered 2 of these Plantranics headsets in May of 2009. Our tech people installed them.As it turns out, one of the headsets upon close visual inspectiong is a refurbished product thatAmazaon sold as new at full price.It lasted about 2 years before it died.The one that truely was new is still working like clockwork.Amazon told me there was nothing they could do. This is the first bad experience I've had with Amazon.Shame on them for selling refurbished as new. Shame on me for not inspecting the productsclosely upon arrival."
2,Sent it back,"I bought this device thinking it would be what I needed. A simple to use, bluetooth hands free phone. Everything was fine except for the automatic lifter. I didn't realize it only worked with select land lines. I wont buy a special corded phone so I sent it back and bought a different one that is from Plantronics and cordless."
4,"Cute, But not Gihbli's Best",This is another beautifully done imaginative story. It is not quite the classic of Spirited Away or Totoro but it is worth watching and quite humorous.
3,Does the Job,"Good didactic summaries, suitable for cramming information into your head long enough to comprehend what's going on in your teenager's high school English class. More often than not, it will be modernized versions of Shakespeare, with modern weapons and other interpretive gloss. This keeps the story straight. But reading the basic stories in stripped down prose almost kills them. So what. It's enough for info-abosrption. Read it if you have to. If you want to read Shakespeare, on the other hand, read it like he wrote it."
3,Good for Older Readers,"This is a good book to glance through, whether you're brushing up on a play you've forgotten or familiarizing youself with the story for the first time. Even though it is easier than actually reading Shakespeare, though, the language is still a little too difficult for children maybe under twelve or so. Adults and teenagers will be able to understand, though."
2,Fusion,"I too was waiting in anticipation...but I sure was disappointed! I don't want to insult the author I'm sure that he tried hard, but come on, and for a price of $30.00!!! I only purchased the book because Amazon recommended it...boy did I get burned!!! Fool me once... Two starts only because it was a quality binding!"
1,Back to the drawing board,"I love action novels that mix plausible science with a good story. I found out about this book when I did a search on Amazon for titles similar to the ones written by Michael Chrichton. The reviews that had been previously posted for ""Fusion"" were so good that I couldn't wait for the book to arrive. Unfortunately, I was so disappointed, that I never made it past the seventh chapter. Mr. Huntly's writing is so amateurish that he makes Michael Crichton look like Shakespeare. If you want a fast-paced story that's fun to read, this is not the book for you."
4,Its a windscreen alright!,"Great little windscreen.Blocks out a lot of noise from wind when filming outdoors. A little overpriced considering its just a piece of foam, but still worth the audio help."
4,Much better dog food!!,"I am very pleased with this dog food and my two dogs love it too! I wanted to find a dog food that was all natural and did not use all of the fillers and animal bi-products that other dog foods use. After doing a lot of research it is very scary to see what is used in most dog foods and how unregulated they are. It is a big eye opener and I am very glad to see a product like Life's Abundance that is made with such high quality ingredients.The only downside is it is very expensive. It does even out a little because you do not have to use as much food per feedings as you do with the commercial brand dog foods. If it wasn't for the price on top of the shipping each time I would give it 5 stars. Aside from the price, it is comforting as a pet owner to know that I am giving them better quality foods and a healthier lifestyle."
4,Not a Bad Saw,"I've had my 321 for a few years now and yes there are some problems with it. To me they are not that bad though. The first problem is that some blades don't seat tightly. I've had some that will come loose once or twice, but i just tighten them up a little bit more and that solves the problem. And it does not take 20 - 30 minutes to change the blade some reviews have said, more like 20 - 30 seconds. The second problem is the dust blower on the saw. Don't get me wrong; it blows air pretty good, just not where you want it. Most of the jigsaws I have used have the same problem. Other than those problems, I think it's a pretty good jigsaw. It's powerful and cut's nicely. It will use almost any blade and cut's straight and clean"
4,Be wary,"The jigsaw is my main power tool I use it for about 90% of my work so I need a good one so I was pleased to find this one at a pawn shop for about sixty bucks. I love this saw it is straight and true with plenty of power. The blade change system is easy to use. I read a lot about people having problems with the soleplate adjustment lever coming loose, but i just tightened the screw on the clamp and I have never had a problem with it. However be very wary of this saw I have talked to a few people who have bought this saw and taken it back after about 10 minutes. Just be wary. If you don't like to gamble go with the Bosch (I just got the cordless one, looking forward to recieving it) but if you can find a good one it is a great saw."
1,horrible product!!!!,This saw doesn't cut straight or parallel!!!! Go for something else or wait till they fix this ones problems. This tool is a total loss for me but so what...I need a good jig saw and probably will get the bosch or metabo barrel grip.ARGGHHHHHH what a pain when you throw away almost 200.00 bucks!!!!!
1,Contains dangerous chemicals,"From the back label:""This product contains chemicals known to the State of California to cause cancer and birth defects or other reproductive harm.""""Do not use on plastic or any porous materials.""""May cause mild skin irritation and mechanical irritation to the eyes. Minimize skin contact and avoid contact with eyes and clothing. Wash thoroughly after handling before eating, drinking or smoking. Wear eye protection when handling. ... Get immediate medical attention if irritation develops.""I didn't even open the lid to try it."
1,Ending Is Very Bad,"I would give 5 stars to the first and second books. I would have given 5 stars to the third but for the final 30 pages. Both authors, for whatever reason, just mess up the ending. They wipe out all the major characters and then have a strange metaphysical experience for Morgan to tie together any loose ends. This ending was a major disappointment to an otherwise superb series."
1,Scary Distraction,"Why would people pay for a book scaring them about murky legends, when the American economy is collapsing right before their eyes? Because some scary stories are a welcome distraction, compared to scary reality."
5,EXCELLENT BOOK!!,"This is an eye opening book, especially in conjunction with the bood ""Politically Incorrect Guide to ISLAM."" I read the PIG book first, then this one. Reading both together was amazingly eye opening."
5,Excellent book,Great book and an eye-opener for people who want to prepare for the anti-christ. The Madhi may well be the anti-christ.
1,A Broken Pretext -> False Conclusion,"I find it rather pitiful that this supposed researcher did not even address the proper figure! The Muslim figure that corresponds with the Anti-Christ is Ad-Dajjal, not Al-Mahdi. How sad that this author could not even do this much: perhaps he did so on purpose in order to suit his own agenda and twist the Islamic doctrine? I am inclined to think the latter. Al-Mahdi, descended from the line of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) is the Imam that will lead the Muslims before the descent of Jesus. Ad-Dajjal is a great deceiver that will lead people into disbelief and is among one of the 10 major signs preceding the Day of Judgment in the Islamic creed. Do the proper research before making grand claims attempting to disprove the truth that is Islam."
1,Not worth the money,"This book is full of one sided beliefs and does not get to the truth behind the religion of Islam. Unfortunately the Author try's to quote their holy book using religious text but does not reference the meaning behind the text itself (basically takes it out of context as does the common media). As a comparative religious professor I must say that this is a total inaccurate depiction of Islam and it's followers, their beliefs and the history of Islam both politically and spiritually."
3,A Little Disappointing,"Cute idea, but the poor quality music component realy was a disappointment. My daughter is such a fan of the 12 Dancing Princesses movie that I was sure this would be an ideal gift. She can't wind it up by herself, the music sounds cheap and off-key, and the little doll broke off the first time she touched it."
2,renee olstead,"CD arrived in condition as described. Of her three albums, this one is not as polished and if I had heard it ahead of time, I would not have purchased it. I think it was her first one, and she was young."
3,Okay...,She is just young on this one. Has matured and that music sounds much better. Cannot wait fot the one coming this spring..
5,Fantastic,What a great CD by a Great singer. Cannot understand why the radio stations are not playing this fantastic singer. This is a must have for everyones collection. The only thing I could possibly bad is that there is not enough songs on here. I have her self-titled and it a great listen. Cannot wait to hear what else this talented singing has to offer.
5,Wow!,"I know it's been said a million times already, but this girl's voice is so mature for her age. She is truly a great talent with awesome range. This album is one of my favorites. I can't decide which album I like better, this one or her self-titled album. I can't wait till her album Skylark is released. Anyone who buys this album will be more than pleased. She puts a fresh twist on old favorites, introducing new audiences to the great jazz genre while satisfying die-hard jazz fans everywhere."
3,CD,I loved the songs in this CD. Great company to deal with and I'll be ordering more stuff from Amazon. Got promply as they said I would.
2,Not much vanilla taste,This vanilla powder is not worth the price. I expected a richer vanilla flavor. I'll stick with a good quality vanilla extract.
5,Hilarious!,"I bought a copy of this and keep it on my coffee table for my friends and I to chuckle over.Kudos to the comedians who wrote this, even now I can barely think about it without laughing!"
4,Great trailor for the twins,"Got it for my twin grandsons.Went together in under an hour and it is a joy to use.Never tried to use it as a stand alone stroller/jogger because my son already had one of those.It did take a bit to figure out how to strap the guys in, but once that was worked out, it was great."
3,Replacements parts hard to find,We recently received this trailer from a friend. Our 16 month old really enjoys riding in it and it is very easy to use. The drawback is that we need to replace the canopy and handlebars and can not find replacements anywhere.
4,Good cleanser,"I've had acne for a while, and my skin tends to dry out during the winter. This cleanser got rid of the dry spots without irritating my acne. It cleans and lightly moisturizes. I would recommend it to anyone with sensitive skin."
3,I HATE THE NAME GAME,"There is nothing to recommend the name game. It is the most stupid thing on earth. It is just stupid gibberish and has too many bananas and name slaughter for me. I abhor it! It should be buried at sea -- in the cesspool! The other songs are good, just the name game has got to go! Retire it forever!"
2,blegh,"I have had 2 of these now and they both have seized up and quit working, good collectors piece but even then, it you are a collector you want something older, also the flash is a pain in the ass. the seller was great though, very fast and product did work when i got it"
2,A disappointment...,"I usually like the MCSE Readiness Reviews. Reading the right and wrong answers is usually a real education. This one, however, is poorly done. It asks too many questions built on faulty scenarios. For example, question 70-219.01.03.002 on page 22 shows a proseware.com domain with child domains called cd.litware.com and dvd.litware.com. How can a child domain have a completely different naming scheme than the parent domain? No one can answer a question set up on such a faulty scenario!Skip this one...."
4,"Easy to use, fine finishes","This tool does a great job at what it is designed to do - finishing sanding. An excellent feature is that you can use any brand or type of paper. The dust collection bag keep things neat, my only complaint is that the bag is easy to knock off. Overall though, this tool is well balanced and very easy to handle."
3,Not as good as Longmire,The Kevin Kerney series is a good Western-Law Enforcement-Procedural Type but not as good as Craig Johnson's Longmire series. A bit too predictable but still enjoyable and evocative of the South-Western landscape and sensibility. I will read others in the series and hope they grow on me.
3,Very good and fair..,"Some sections of the book were very good and some were only fair. The author really made her growing up seem like it went on forever (and ever) But there were some sections that were very painful to read and they were very well written, but those sections were not the majority of this book. Read it only if you have a long time to plod through it..which I am pleased to say I have finished it and I am moving on to my next memoir."
2,G & S in concert,"I was actually expecting excerpts from G&S operettas rather than a concert version next to an orchestra conductor. I was truly disappointed and not at all thrilled by the performers themselves. I seldom give negative opinions about anything, but I didn't finish watching this and I won't go back to it."
1,Not enough content for the price,"Less than a hour of music for more money than a full length 2 hour plus opera. I didn't listen to the songs since I didn't want to remove the shrink wrap so I could return it. I'm sure they are fine, just not enough of them."
1,Just one more book in the blame game,"I read this book hoping to gain a new perspective of ""Black America's"" part in helping to create this nation. Instead, I found a book steeped in racial hatred for ""White America"". The book read as a Political Manifesto for why America's founding fathers' ephagies should be burned at the stakes. The rhetoric of this book would be useful for present day arguments for slave reperations' (as a thinly veiled line indicates in the last chapter), communism, or a socialized healthcare system. If one is to believe the author one might fathom that most African Americans are still physically chained to the ills of slavery in modern times."
2,For Diehard Joni Fans Only!,"This dvd is amateurish. The band is playing on a stage in a dark setting with a fake audience sounds. Joni in white hair has her worst band trying to be hip in the 80's. In between there are clips from home movies that are dated and filmed poorly. Joni Mitchell's worst period was this decade until she found herself later on ""Night Ride Home"". She has four official dvd's. This one is a distant fourth. Avoid unless you have a fascination about the ""Ice Maiden"" trying to pretend to be an eighties rocker. It didn't work."
2,Disappointed,"If you like the original game play, this edition is not for you. The different board set up and the timer that controls the category kinda sucks. It is nice to have the new cards but I like the way the original board was set up. Hard to play some of the new categories with just a team of two. Better off with the original game."
2,Not Competitive,"You can't see what you are working on well for a detail sander...that's the biggest problem. It goes down from there. High vibration, fairly noisy, and uncomfortable handle. I am surprised that DeWalt released this. It is beneath their standard. It's really just a grinder I think that has been reworked to do random orbit. Not competitive with Bosch or PC."
1,Don't read this book.,"This book is not so rare novadays examples of how a book could be even less comprehensive than a API specification. Author constantly gives unclear definitions to a variety of terms, explains unknown through unknown and does all other sorts on bad things that make reading of this book harmful for anyone but an experienced JXTA user brushing up on something. The plan of the book basically copies documents published on jxta web.If you want to get a clear picture of what JXTA is and what it could do for you, get something else."
5,Comprehensive guide and real examples,One of the most striking things about this book is the inclusion of real-world examples. Those who have used the distributed.net application will like the chapter that uses JXTA to build a framework for distributing computations.The chapter on building a three-tier encrypted storage system shows the power of the JXTA specification and JAVA implementation.I highly recommend this book for learning JXTA. The writing is clear and the numerous examples will have you coding peer-to-peer applications in short order.
3,"Good hands-on material, but does not follow MCSE objectives.","I used this book to teach a Net Essentials class. I found the hands on project to be very helpful to my students. However, the subject matter is not organized by Microsoft's exam objectives. If a student performs poorly on a practice exam in one area it is difficult to go back and study that one objective. This book is well writen for the classroom. I would not recomend this book for self-study due to the above mentioned problems."
1,A waste of paper!,"As a gay man I enjoy sci-fi erotica, but this book was a waste of paper. It seems that the author had an idea to have sex in ancient Egypt and not enough imagination to write a good story. Leave this one on the shelf."
2,Almost perfect. Almost.,"Everything about this was awesome, except that the unit I bought, the blade was slightly out of parallel with the fence; about 1/32"" higher on one side of the cut.If I could guarantee a parallel cut, I'd buy this again; until then, going with a PC or Makita."
4,baby fingers,"The plusses have been clearly stated by others. I agree; smooth,stable,powerful...almost everything you could wish for. I disagree with the folks who said it was a noisy and that it clogged often. I've had just the opposite experience. But: the adjustment knobs are sized for a 6 year old's fingers.....too small for my adult fingers. And the person who invented the box saved every last micron of plastic possible in sizing it. It doesn't even fit the tool without forcing the power cord in. Complaints aside, I give the tool 5 stars and take one back for cheap shortcuts"
1,Looks great but performs poorly,This DeWalt plate joiner felt great when I took it out of the box. But when I turrned it on it was very loud making it unpleasant to use. Also this tool shoots the dust right in your eyes. The fence angle indicator is not accurate. And set up takes too long vs the Porter Cable. I will go back to Porter Cable next time.
2,Review,"I purchased a new Dewalt 682K. The instructions were not great, especially for me (a relatively new woodworker). However, the problem was the depth gauge for the plunge--none (0, 10, 20, M) worked. With the exception of 0 (which was much deeper than it should have been), the other three were all the same depth. So, I took it back to the vendor (Western Tool). They pulled out a floor model to compare. Its depth guage didn't work either! That was the end of my Dewalt biscuit joiner."
3,Inconsistent results,"I've had this Plate Joiner for about 5 years. When I first got it, I thought it was great. It made slots that I could put biscuits in and join stuff. However, the first time I used it to make a critical joint, the major shortcoming showed up. The slots are not parallel to the base. They are a little more parallel when using the fence, but I prefer using the base indexing method.Also, as many other reviewers have noted, the chip ejection chute gets clogged very easily, making it difficult to work cleanly."
5,"Great fun, terrific story, good action","This is a very, very good movie. It's very entertaining from the get-go and has some stunning visuals. There's also a good few laughs as well as some top notch action. Very enjoyable stuff.Sherlock Holmes and the Flying Zombie Death Monkeys"
2,disappointed,"What can I say ,the first Hellboy - Graphic Novel. The second Hellboy - MIB (men in black). Guess I assumed del torro could actually pull a sequel off on this otherwise great character..."
3,"This DVD says Widescreen, but it plays Fullscreen","Love the movie - it's the DVD I'm not crazy about! It plays in Fullscreen, not Widescreen, although Amazon AND the DVD case say that it's in Widescreen (letterbox.) I can't find anything on the disc's menu that allows you to change the format. It's not my equipment - all my other Widescreen DVDs play in Widescreen with no problems using my DVD player and TV set. I'm puzzled that both the Hellboy movies' DVDs that I bought here on Amazon say Widescreen, but play in Fullscreen."
2,"Hellboy II, The Golden Army","What a disappointment. Sequels are rarely as good as originals, but this was a clinker. Special effects were good, story was thin, acting was so-so. My advice: Wait until it gets to TV and watch it for free."
3,Too busy,"There was just too much going on in the movie. It needed fewer creaturesabd fewer action scenes. The clutter needed to be reduced. The simpler scenes played better, for example, Hellboy and Abe singing and getting drunk together because they were having love problems.That said - I really liked the evil elf (Goss) who really wasn't so evil. He actually had a point. I would like to see Goss in another movie."
3,Hellboy II: The Golden Army [Blu-ray],Good DVD but a bit over the top. Entertaining and I like the characters.I paid a few dollars more than it costs at Wal-Mart though.
5,I loved it.. as good as the first movie,"I loved it.. as good as the first movieI did cringe a little with the drunken singing, was it Barry Manilow ?? eek.Other than that this movie exceeded my expectations and looked fabulous on blu ray..True, this movie does seem to take alot of ideas from the Men In Black movies, but I happen to love MIB 1&2 so I was ok with that.I hope we get a HELLBOY 3 !I just watched part 1 and part 2 in 1 sitting and it was a great afternoon of movies.I highly recommed this movie. YOu might want to mute the volume at the end with the Barry Manilow again."
4,Very entertaining,"I liked this one even better than the first. If you liked Pans Labyrinth, this has a very similar feel. A lot of good humor, cool characters, and fast action."
3,"Better than the first movie, but still not great","I thought the first movie introduced some great characters, but I didn't care much for the story, which I barely remember now. The sequel has more impressive visuals and action (particularly in the battle with the forest god), but again the story is pretty blah. This is yet another movie that involves a legend, a magical object, and a magical army. Once you learn that the villain and his twin sister are ""linked,"" it's not hard to predict how the film is going to end.Bottom line: An enjoyable comic book flick, but it still feels like the Hellboy universe hasn't met its full potential. This ill-tempered, wise-cracking, cat-loving, cigar-smoking, demonic crime fighter deserves better.Richard Yee, author of Deliveries: A Collection"
4,Lots of extra features.,"The three disc edition is 1. Movie 2. Bonus Disk 3. Digital Download Disk (meaning it will save to your computer's hard drive or play in computer only, not DVD player) Movie is good, lots of special effects and trademare Hellboy humor. Different voice actor on Abe Sapian (fish guy) and Hellboy's new handler, Meyers, is not in the movie at all. Over 2 hours of behind the scenes and making-of features along with other cool stuff."
2,Disappointed.,"We were all set to watch a great movie and were very disappointed. The first movie was so much better and this was a total letdown. The underlying story was pretty corny, too."
1,Was so dissapointed,It could have been so much better. And who's stupid idea was that lame musical interlude? ( the duet )
4,Chiefly for those who like Disney's Fantasia,"This is not an opera, nor a cartoon version of an opera.What it is, is an animated film of the story of Humperdinck's Hansel and Gretel, presented in the style of Walt Disney's Fantasia. The artists made little figures, with such amazing detail that it allows for facial expressions and movement, and then took more than 140,000 pictures of them to give them movement and life. It makes for a very unusual presentation--neither cartoon nor real people.It appeals to mainly two groups: those looking for an introduction to the opera or story of Hansel and Gretel, and those interested in a movie like Disney's ""Fantasia.""Oh, I should have said THREE groups: there is also a growing interest in this as a camp movie (like the Rocky Horror Picture Show). Most of this comes as a result of love for the great operatic comedienne, Anna Russell, who was in this production the delightfully camp voice of the witch, Rosina Rubylips."
4,They Were Great When at Their Best,"S & D were hardly the best of the British punk bands of the 70s but that doesn't mean they were weakies, either. You haven't lived if you haven't heard ""Cranked Really High"" and ""Where Have All The Boot Boys Gone?"", which rides on the greatest hard rock riff of the 70s."
3,"Fun Tidbits, But Poorly Written","As a Jeff Gordon fan, I already was aware of much of the information contained in the book. Nonetheless, for the price it's well worth buying for the fun bits of information that I hadn't heard elsewhere. However, I do have to say that the book is poorly written. George Mair obviously fails to comprehend the notion of chronological order, jumping back and forth in a manner that is truly distracting to the reader."
3,Not one of Hendrix's better live documents,"Sorry to rain on the parade, but I listened to this CD yesterday for the first time in many years (it's been gathering dust on my shelf and I thought I should give it another try). While the recording quality is very good, especially for 1968, Hendrix seems to me to be kind of struggling through much of the set. Compared to other live recordings like the inspired ""Band of Gypsies"" and his incindiary Woodstock set, his playing here to me sounds somewhat unfocused, like it's just not an ""on"" night for him. At his finest, Hendrix was the best rock guitarist that ever lived. In my opinion, this Winterland set is just not one of his better performances. It doesn't have that ""magic"" that Hendrix frequently displayed when playing live."
1,having a hard time following her.,"I love boxing but this video is way to complicated.. I found myself trying to follow her, it was way to fast that I could not follow, the first time I only complete 5 minutes, the second time 15 minutes. so I am not sure if I want to try a third time. It to fast that is hard to even break a sweat, and even the people in the video are having a hard time sometimes following her.maybe she is too advance for my level."
5,change,Season three showed where there were a lot of changes and new adventures. I enjoyed it very much. Can't wait til season four.
4,"Cute title, different mixture","This album, whose title implies a spooky Halloween type music is a mixture of not only wild and tempting music but some relaxing ones as well. I was first introduced to Fodor's music when he appeared in my somewhat small city for a concert. He is a very fine virtuoso and I loved that nights experience. I listened to the cd and was amazed. He has great talent and this ""brew,"" mixture of different kinds of music is a great musical experience to anyone who loves the art of violin as well as music. He leers at you through his music and then lovingly puts his emotions into each note. Fun to listen to!"
2,IF YOU WANT TO USE WINDOWS XP DON'T BUY IT !,Pros:- Price- Design (white)Cons:- Drivers for Windows XP not available- Weight and size (my God it's heavy)
1,Vaio Products are Horrible. Stay Away,"I have had nothing but problems with Vaio laptops. The DVD cannot read half the discs that I put in it. The audio doesn't work. There are all kinds of preinstalled programs on here that i can't uninstall. To boot, the customer service is terrible. I never had these problem by IBM."
4,great value,"This is a very nice shirt for $10. The fabric is soft, but not too thick or bulky. Sizing is on the big side, so consider going one size down unless you want the baggy look."
4,Good seat - great price!!,"Great price compared to the very expensive Britax Regent[...]and Sunshine Kids65 [...]I did a ton of research to find a 5-point harness for my 2 year old who is 45 lbs. I based my decision on price and reviews from various websites. This seat is comfortable, light weight, and easy to install. My only concern is the shape and position of the bunkle. After adjusting the crouch strap to the 3rd position (the one furthest out), the bunkle still digs into my toddler's cute but rather chucky thighs. I would recommend this seat for the budget-tight family; however, if you've got the cash go for the Britax."
3,Java once again proving .NET is superior,"The authors of this book are quite simply brilliant. However, it once again demonstrated to me the point that JAVA is still immature and that Microsoft has the correct approach with it's .NET platform. After reading this book, I was thinking that programming in JAVA is just another exercise in futility."
4,Another good Java book...,"This book is chock full of Java programming and architecture goodies. No Java programmer or architect should be without it. It hits on some of the subtleties of the paradigm and makes some great suggestions for solutions to common problems. I've already used several since I read the book three months ago. It covers the full range of the Java paradigm from EJBs to Servelts and JSPs. It also covers many Java Web service APIs such as JAXP, JAXR and JAXM. Unlike many other books, it also address J2ME, GUI programming and several utilities. Readers should also check out the web site that goes along with the book. It provides sample code, corrections to the text and links to additional resources."
3,Way too convoluted,"Interesting, damaged characters can't maintain the readers' attention, when presidential conspiracy is added. Lots to like, but ultimately disappointing."
2,Hummm?,"All in all I did like the book. I enjoyed the narration, despite the fact that the narrator was somewhat of a depressant. However, I don't know if there was some sort of political bias crafted by S. Thayer, but republicans then and now obviously don't complement the rudimentary actions of the book's characters as the author might have intended. Secondly, and most importantly the reason why I rated this book lower than three stars is this: The sex scenes. I have heard of vicarious reading but this was more in the area of vicarious writing. Sure, it was illicit and many people will find these sections of the book exciting, but that is why they sell penthouse magazines. Three pages to describe (sexually) a scene (early in the book), and yet the point of the scene was summed up in less than one paragraph. Go figure?"
1,Elementary General Music Teacher is Disappointed,"I purchased this video to supplement a composer lesson about Mozart. The video is an abridged version of the Mozart opera, The Magic Flute. I was disappointed by the poor video quality and poor production values. One of the reasons I purchased an abridged version is that the full opera would be much to lengthy for elementary school audiences and I thought I would be able to show this in its entirity due to its abbreviated length, but the video is so poor, it failed to capture even my interest as an ADULT with two music degrees (one in vocal music performance, no less). I DO NOT recommend this video. It is useful to be shown in short excerpts only. It is definitely not worth using the precious little funds you may already receive for equipment/supplies."
2,Complex?,"I'm unsure how anyone could classify this album as complex or good metal. The guitars are mediocre at best, the vocals are more prominent than the music and I find them to be pretty awful. The only thing they have going for them are the drums.Also, pretty much every song (aside from the title track) sounds the same. Songs that stood out the most were Laid to Rest, Blood of the Scribe, and What I've Become. The rest I didnt find to be entertaining in the least.If you're looking for good metal, might as well look to their tour buddies Children of Bodom and Fear Factory, and others, i.e. In Flames, Killswitch Engage, Dark Tranquillity, Soilwork, Opeth, etc etc etc."
2,Sucks....,"I'm not a kid, I'm actually 17. This band does not do anything new or original for the genre of metal. Unless you consider throaty vocals an innovation. Just because Lamb of God is better than most contemporary metal bands, doesn't mean you should praise them. I say metal is dead(along with a plethora of other music genres). There are many great metal bands from the 70s - mid 90s, and I'm sure even the most diehard metalhead has yet to listen to a few. Let metal die, so we can stop misleading future generations of metalheads to listen to worse metal than they could actually be listening to."
4,One of the best modern metal bands around,"I think this album is a good example of what they should call 'new metal' (not nu-metal): keeping the basis of the classic metal but adapted to the days we are living.'Ashes of the Wake' is one of the best metal albums of 2004, and of course, production has a lot to do with this. It is the most clear difference between this and the first two albums by Lamb of God.'Blood of the Scribe', 'Hourglass', 'What I've Become', 'Ashes of the Wake' and the killer 'Laid to Rest' are my favourite songs in this record."
5,The Return of True Metal,"Talk about an eye opener. Lamb of God originally from Richmond Virginia has wow'd me once again! I was partial to As the Palaces Burn just due to the message it sent out. But now, with Ashes of the Wake this is pure, driving, chaotic metal. This is what you Mosh to, this is what you release anger with. This is the premiere Metal album of the year. Pure unrelenting focused anger. The vocalist has one of the most distinct voices in the business and Lamb of God is ready to explode!"
3,"better produced, more mature but to commercialized for me","I do like this album, it has better production, thus the quality sounds better. And LOG have matured on this album with some of the greatest riffs going. I can't compliment Morton and Adler enough and the rest of them. But, some of the songs got political and were too long. LOG jumping on the band wagon of politics/anti-Bush gets to me. I don't support Bush, but I like to hear music to get away from the corrupt politics of America and the rest of the world. NOT to hear about them on a LOG album. And Randy Blythe squaking about how bad the Iraqi war is won't change anything. LOG are using this ""against Bush"" theme like a gig, it is becoming their gig and cover...GET REAL!!!!!!!!!!!. I prefer As The Palaces Burn. That album was real, AOTW isn't so real to me."
5,lamb of god- ashes of the wake,"well, first off i would like to say that i am a huge metal fan. well, music in general, but metal is by far my favorite. my favorite metal is probably 80's metal for sure. but i do like some fear factory, some korn, some deftones, and i would have to say that lamb of god is possibly the most intense metal band to ever come out of the western hemisphere. if you like the rhythms and overall intensity of scandinavian black metal, but dont really like all the dungeons and dragons/fantasy/macabre lyrics and majestic vocals, then you would really like this album. this has some of the coolest and most intricate riffs ive ever heard, and some pretty sick lead work on it too. a lot more so than the last album. overall, this is one of the best metal albums ive ever heard. lamb of god has slowly become one of my favorite bands since i got this album."
3,Average Metal,"Average Slayer influenced metal. Nothing special, not bad and not great either. I don't care for the generic singer, he sounds way too nu metal for my tastes. The band are pretty good musicians if unoriginal."
2,"""Get Away from me' --- and please do it quickly","Having heard a few songs of hers on the radio and a review on NPR's ""Fresh Air with Terry Gross"" I thought I'd go ahead and spend the cash. I listened to both CDs a lot for about six weeks trying to figure out why I was having such a weird reaction to it..and I finally did.Miss McKay sure has a lot of talent as a musician and a singer but eventually it is her skills as a songwriter and lyricist she is simply annoying. Not brilliant, not insightful; just annoying and just too young to be as deeply world and male weary as she wants us to think she is. So that pose just comes across as just glib pretense . Occasionally funny but mostly just annoying right now it will be interesting to see what she is capable of in ten years. But for now, you can skip the act.(and no I don't particularly care care for Norah Jones as a songwriter either.)"
2,Clever but lets get serious...,"Now I know that Nellie McKay is a terribly clever young song writer, and her music and lyrics are very sophisticated for her age. And I listen to enough music to dig the whole Blossom Dearie goes broadway vibe. I even know this next bit isn't really fair- comparing apples to angels, but doesn't Jolie Holland make poor Nellie kind of irrelevant?"
1,Imitation,"Its really sad, that shes just imitating many styles, adding nothing on the way. Im really dissapointed."
4,Original but sometimes boring,"Nellie McKay certainly has a unique sound and a fresh perspective. I'd have to say though that her vocal talents are not nearly as amazing as what she can do on the piano. The songs are kind of hit or miss. I think all the upbeat songs are very good but the slow loungey type songs just seem boring to me. There was no reason for this to be a double disk CD, they could have shaved out the junk and just released one CD that is much better all around."
3,History Lesson,This book is filled with history. I enjoyed learning about young singers I had never heard of. This was a really good read.
5,Truth Behind the Glitter and Gold Records!,"Mary Wilson is the founding member of the world's favorite and legendary girlgroup, The Supremes. In this book, she tells the truth of Motown and how their treatment of the girls either ruined or glamorized their lives (La Ross). This book is very emotional and is the best I've read in years. I commend Mary for being the first to tell the honest-to-God truth. She is the supreme Supreme. If you think you know everything about the Supremes, you best read this book. There are secrets and events here that I've never even heard of -- and I have all of their records! Buy this book, you won't regret it. Trust me."
1,Cashing in...again...,"Mary Wilson obviously needs some form of attention, as her oldies revues aren't attracting the mega audiences that she so desires. So, what does she do??? Reprint her trashy exposes.Mary...get a life..."
1,worthless approach for active defense reflex dogs,"When attempting to find solutions to training problems in a rough collie showing active defense reflex behavior problems (see William Campbell's 'Behavior Problems in Dogs') I read this book. The author fails to take into consideration the differences between active and passive defense reflex dogs. At the time, a number of dog trainers in our area were focused on this approach to training. In class, I was required to reposition my dog physically rather than using vocal cues to correct his behavior (the Bauman approach). This absolutely does NOT work with an active defense reflex dog! You can't imagine the problems this approach to training caused for my dog. I later found William Campbell's book, figured out a proper approach to training my dog, and consequently put a CD on him. The 'Bauman' trainers had told me I'd never succeed, but they lacked the insight into dog behavior to problem solve outside their 'box'."
5,Super at blocking noise,"I believe this is the best of the various types that Macks has to offer. They are rated at 32 db and I could not find any with a higher rating. If you really want to block out noise, I don't know why anyone would get some with a lower rating (for example, they offer one rated at 22 db). There are others rated at 32 db (Mack's Snore Blockers Soft Foam Earplugs 12 pr), but they do not block noise as well as the Ultra (see my review of the Snore Blockers).If you want to sleep thru a ""snorer"", crack of dawn lawn mowing, or other noises that interefere with sleep, these are great. Also great for use in hotel/motel rooms if there is a lot of noise in adjoining rooms and/or in the conference rooms or ballrooms in some hotels or if the AC or heater in your room is very loud. Also blocks airplane noise in airport hotels.I also found a travel alarm that is sure to wake you up, even when using these. See my review of it here:Elgin Travel Alarm Clock"
2,No better than others,"I was hoping these would be more comfortable and better performance than ones I had purchased at Walmart for pennies. I was wrong. These didn't do any better at blocking out my hubby's snoring. Also, they are just as uncomfortable to sleep in. Don't waste money here, just to got Walmart."
1,Absolutely horrible,"Ill-fitting, oversized, cheap material. Waste of money.Can buy similar but much better items elsewhere including Lands End.Terrible tailoring."
3,Runs very large,"I ordered large because that is my husbands size, but the shirt was huge. Nice shirts though. I reordered in medium."
2,Nice Product Until Washed,"Received the Mock Turtleneck and was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the shirt until I put it in the wash. The shirt began ""pilling"" and the color seemed a couple shades lighter than I remembered before putting it in the washing machine. Long story short, I am disappointed and would not recommend this product or brand. The vendor shipped on time but shipping sub-standard products doesn't warrant a high rating."
1,Race-o-mania,"While race is certainly an important topic, it should not become the popular be-all and end-all of a general history such as this one. I bought this book and began it with great anticipation, but soon found its author had on blinders. This is typical of a kind of fadism that comes from academics and academic presses. Let's relegate this volume itself to history---the history of a time when academics lost sight of all but academic careerism via the proper politically correct attitudes and postures. By the way, there are many typesetting errors and small errors of fact here and there. One wonders if the author is a journalist or a historian, when he gets on his political kicks."
1,Where's the Rest of the Story?,"In 1948 South Carolina's most famous citizen of the modern era -- Strom Thurmond -- ran for President of the United States. In a speech in Birmingham, Alabama he urged a race war in the event blacks were ever granted access to public accommodations.The funny thing is that the United States and its allies hanged Germans who fomented less hatred than Senator Thurmond did in his previous incarnation as a race baiter.Chesterton once said that the greatest criminals have committed no crimes. And Augosto Pinochet proved that a man's deeds aren't always locked away in the past.For Walter Edgar to ignore Thurmond's incendiary remarks is an unspeakable oversight. What else did he leave out? And why?"
5,Great Watch/Great Deal!,I bought this watch a week ago from JTV thru Amazon. It was $242.48 with no tax and free shipping. The retail price is $675. Macy's had it on sale for $506 and some online stores had it for around $350. I received it from JTV via UPS the day after I ordered it. It was nicely packaged in a new Bulouva box with plenty of padding. The watch looks fantastic and I couldn't be more pleased. The diamonds and the black face make for a very classy look.
2,itty bitty,everything on this watch is so tiny that i had to send it back. you cannot read the dials to see the date with the naked eye. it is a beautiful watch if you do not need to use the functions.
3,another Hercules type film,Only for the Hercules movie fan as the effects aren't as good as they could have been. A low budget production. but the locations are great.
2,No #1 Record,"Maybe I'll listen to this record again. I don't know though. If you've listened to #1 Record/Radio City over and over like me, and wondered why Big Star never got really popular, this record will answer your questions. The stripped down band (no Chris Bell and no overdubs) can't do justice to the songs. Plus, Alex Chilton's difficult personality had driven the original bass player out of the group just weeks before this recording, and it shows. The only worthwhile stuff is the solo acoustic numbers, which are great. I'll stick with #1 Record/Radio City and Chris Bell's ""I Am The Cosmos."""
5,It's a classic!,"This shirt is cut to fit a woman; it's curved in the right places. The fabric is just the right weight and this design on black is classic. Love it! Plus, I got a Timmy sticker with it - what could top that?!"
2,"No Amel, No Good","I was highly anticipating Sweetback's 2nd offering, but after listening to it a few times unfortunately I must say that it was... boring. It seems that the artistry they showed on their 1st album is gone. I mean, take for example ""Things You'll Never Know"" which is just a laughably mediocre pop-rock tune for crying out loud. This is just unacceptable coming from Sweetback. I also really had high expectations for ""Love Is the Word"" since I read that it samples Isley Brothers' ""Between the Sheets"" and borrows the melody from Bobby Caldwell's ""What You Won't Do for Love"" (I was like, how could you possibly go wrong with that?) BUT, this was a huge disappointment since the song has this lame reggae feel when it would've been so much better with an r&b/soul arrangement.So if you're like me expecting another heavenly masterpiece like ""You Will Rise"" from their 1st album, forget it - you won't find it here."
3,"Decent, but not up to the standards previously set","I've been a musician for a long time.....completely love Sade, all their albums. And I loved Sweetback's first effort.........this one falls short. It is still engaging, still competently recorded, still interesting, but.....lacks something. Just does not have the punch, the inovation of their first effort. Worth having, but nothing stands out as superb. Obviously fabulously talented musicians............just not up to their previous standard. As other reviews have stated, there is enough spark to make the album interesting, but not enough to make it stand out the way all their other efforts have. Sorry! I really wanted to love this one!"
4,Lovely mix,Still good stuff - if I was to choose I would choose the first albumA good buy - I was happy
2,Mix Results,dug the first Album a bit more.it felt more like a Looser Project.this Album feels like what was left on the cutting room floor off the first album.a couple tracks are decent but nothing really holds my attention.some nice runs with Grooves here&there but just aveage at best.
1,DEFECTIVE PRODUCT,I too am on my 2nd replacement head...it keeps falling off the base after a couple of times. Defective Product! Very disappointed! Sort of in a bind since I invested so much money in the Cybersonic Toothbrush.
4,Anyone for bingo,This was the first game we purchased for my son and two years later we are still playing it. It is nicely designed with a little drawstring bag to hold the chips and sturdy cards.
4,You're getting verrryyy sleeeppyyyyyy...........,"There are no melodies to hold onto, no ways of knowing when each track ends except for the breaks of silence. ""Innerzone"" is completely shapeless, and you can get lost in it pretty quick. Steve Roach and vidnaObmana (his spelling) are the kings of Projekt's ambient market. This album doesn't even have a consistent ethnic flavor.If you're not familiar with these guys, make sure to play the samples above. The general mood is one of being lost in a mist-shrouded dream. You're lost in a deserted coastal village, and there's Something Else wandering through the streets, just as blind and confused as you...No lyrics, almost no drums, nothing you can hum. In that respect, it's sort of like A Murder of Angels' ""While You Sleep."" ""Innerzone"" is mysterious and long. It's not New Age, and it's not World Music. Its hypnotic quality comes from the sheer mystery of the sound."
5,Relaxing,"The sixth album by Steve Roach and Vidna Obmana proves to be one of the best. As soon as the album starts you will be lost in a relaxing dreamy soundworld. The music nearly forces you to relax, even during parts with fast beats and tense rhythms. But somehow, almost magically, it soothes you and clears your mind. If you like Steve Roach or Vidna Obmana, this one is definitely worth your money."
2,True: It never happened; Another bad example.,"It's an insult to us veterans, and esp. cavalry troopers, for hollyweird to sludge ahead w/ farb films, when they known darn well it's a lie! Viewers should not support same w/ their dollars. The shameful treatment of the WWI vets of the Bonus Army, however, could have been better documented, and offered as entertainment also! Political pressures are part of American military history, but outright falsehoods of PC bunk have no place in it. Remember this when you think about governance, and head for the polls.Sgt. Gary A. Hurd, 26th U.S. Cavalry Philippine Scouts MR, Horse: 1913-1941; Restored 2003-Pres."
2,"Dark, Depressing, Violent & not about Venice,","I was looking for an award-winning mystery in hopes of finding an interesting read that wasn't the waste of money that so many books are, especially when you can now part with your cash so fast. Silly me, I clicked before I read the reviews, thinking this book would be set in Venice. Not even close. This is tough stuff, at times well-written, but at other times, not well-written or edited. I seldom quit a read, but I'm done early on this one. This will teach me not just to read the reviews, but to take the time to digest a sample too. Not my taste, but if you're into tough, violent, depressing, hopeless post-World War II mysteries, you'll like it. To compare it to LeCarre is a stretch to me, but it's pre-Cold War, so perhaps it has historical value that eludes me."
2,"Fits good, but holder sucks",This Panavise bracket fits very good in my s2000. It's exactly the look I was after and it works very well in the position it's in. However they only offer like one holder piece that fits with this. And it rattles like a rattlesnake on 5 hour energy. It's annoying annoying annoying.
2,"Good selection of songs, over done performances","I bought this CD on a whim because of the great song selection (Box of Rain, Brown Eyed Women, Jack Straw, etc.) and thought it would be good to hear them acoustically, but was sorely disapointed. Hunter's guitar playing isn't at all good, and his harp playing is worse. The singing is all over-done and over-emoted. Stick with the original Grateful Dead versions."
1,Repeat,"I bought this hoping to add to my collection of Judy Reeves's prompts, unfortunately all this is is a repackaging of A Writer's Book of Days: A Spirited Companion and Lively Muse for the Writing Life. The year's worth of prompts are in the kit's book, followed by lined pages. The advice and encouragement on the kit's cards can be found among the pages of her Writing Book of Days. I'm very disappointed that Reeves couldn't create more prompts rather than simply making more money off of her previous work."
2,DVD a big disappointment...,"First of all, let me start by saying that I love this film. A true classic: very funny, great songs and wonderful characters. But the DVD looks terrible. Scratches, and even awkward skips in the transfer. Picture is often blurry and sound is muffled. I wish I could say that they had restored it, but it looks more like a bootleg transfer than a legitimate release. The old, out-of-print VHS version had a much better film transfer on it. At least that one didn't frame-skip in the middle of the dialogue like this DVD transfer does! Maybe someday this film will get the DVD treatment it so richly deserves. Oh, by the way--for those who care, there are NO extras to speak of on it.EDIT: Please see my comment below about the new Shout! Factory release. It's much better!"
3,not color as advertized,I absolutely love this movie and was thrilled when I saw the new release of the dvd and that you say it is in color. It is NOT! Bought two and returned them. We have several dvd's of the B&W version. Please fix this on your description so others aren't put to the trouble I was.
4,The lemon drop kid,really fun to watch - we had it in no time and had no issues with the condition! We'll continue to buy more!
1,FOX is unbelieveable,"I love this show, I've watched every season from season 1 to the present.But, this DVD has no purpose other than to make extra $$$ for FOX. Come on, just 4 episodes that was on TV the same week? Why would anyone buy this? Just enjoy the show on Monday nights and buy the full-season DVD in a few months."
2,Great Series but now too old,"I was a HUGE fan of Tycoon 2 and bought #3 a while ago, just never got to it and assume it is as good if not better, but there is no resolution to the lack of Windows 7 compatibility. I had to upgrade from XP so I lost the chance to play it, and if no patch supports windows 7 and you plan to go to 7, then do not buy this as it states Windows 7 is not compatible and there are NO patches. I only could get 1.05 patch and 1.06 does not help."
3,"A FRENCH ""WHEN HARRY MET SALLY""","BEING A FAN OF JULIETTE BINOCHES' DRAMATIC ROLES. I FOUND THIS A NICE CHANGE OF PACE FOR THE ACTRESS, SHOWING SOME LIGHT COMEDIC FLAIR.ALTHOUGH THE FILM DOESN'T BRING ANYTHING NEW TO THE BATTLE OF THE SEXES,IT TRAVELS ALONG QUITE NICELY. DELIVERING TWO QUITE POLAR-OPPOSITE PERFORMANCES FROM THE LEADS, I HOPE JULIETTE CHOOSES MORE OF THESE KINDS OF ROLES IN HER FUTURE."
1,Cyber Bad,"This product worked very well for a while, but now the batteries won't keep a charge. They didn't last very long."
3,NOT the original,"I had an original Cybersonic from about 10 years ago and loved it for the flossing attachment. Mine died a while back and after realizing that I was not flossing as consistently as I used to since it died, I ordered another one. I was surprised that the flossing attachment has changed to replaceable proprietary flossing heads instead of regular off the shelf floss. No thanks..."
1,Wrong pen for new Wacom tablet,I ordered this art pen with my new tablet and found it was the wrong one. If in doubt check with Wacom to find the right pen for your tablet.
3,Wacom 6D Art Pen,"This is a good pen. It's lighter than the Grip pen. I didn't like that it doesn't have buttons like the other pens, which make it easier to change the ""brushes"" or their size, or use them just like a mouse. Its functions are great. It does everything it promises. It is a nice pen to work with, but I'm giving it a 3 star rating because it looks and feels very cheap. I think it is too expensive for something that looks and feels like a toy bought in a dollar store."
1,Unplayable,"I ordered this Audio CD instead of downloading the MP3 because I wanted the highest possible quality. However, when I received the CD and my player wouldn't play it, I discovered it had been encoded as VBR (variable bit rate) MP3 files. The description clearly stated Audio CD. The product was falsely labeled as CD when it was really VBR."
1,A Great Cure For Insomnia,"The premise is great: cruise ship passengers survive the end of the world and start anew.The author is an engineer and this book is written as only an engineer can: dry and boring.There is no life in the characters (at least in the first couple hundred pages which is as far as I got). It reads like a college textbook.At one point, the survivors have a contest to name their new city. The author has them choose: ""Engineering Village""...Geez, how creative!I will give this book praise on one point: It cured my insomnia on two occasions. This is the absolute truth. Couldn't sleep, started reading and after about 3 pages I was out."
3,J-O-E Is Smooth and Clever,"Well, I must say that this CD was a pleasant surprise. The songs remind me at times of those Wainwright fellows (both Loudon and Rufus, or of those by the underappreciated Big Fish Ensemble, or those of kid's favs Trout Fishing in America, or even just a bit of some of Cat Steven's work.But clearly, Joe hears his own muse and has his own ideas. The songs sound fresh yet have an everyman quality about them, too. There's humor and a dash of pathos. I'm not too taken with the solo performances, but then again, I don't really like anybody's solo stuff that much.The recording quality is superb and crisp unlike some CDs I've heard from independent labels (not meant to be a knock on indies, mind you)."
4,The Knights Templar: Tracking History's most intriguing monks.,"As any Historian, I have varied approaches to understanding history, and I for one appreciate a well written chronology of events. This book, ""The Knights Templar: Tracking History's most Intriguing Monks"" was just such a book. Very well put together, with good documentation, and, drawing a very distinctive line through history's accounting of the Templar's activities, from their beginnings as a humble order of only a handful of knights, all the way up to their apparent ""reign"" - via the authority of the church, and practically every Lord and Noble reaching from Jerusulam to Scotland - over all things economic and military, from 1065, and in some respects, reaching right up to the present day. For anyone interested in Templar history, I think this should be their starting point. From here, you can reach out to anywhere to decide what was true, and what was legend..."
3,Extreme riding,Not a bad film by any means. A little short on the total length for my tastes and some of the music selections were a little questionable. Big air and deep powder - every riders dream.
1,Wasn't a good choice!,"The earrings in person looked very cheap and once I received them, I felt I paid too much for the lack of quality of the earrings, although they looked nice on the internet."
3,Can't stand,"The sculpt and paint for this figure weren't particularly bad for the mid-1990s. However, it was notorious for not being able to stand on its own. I remember struggling to get him to stand up for my dioramas. Fortunately, there's a new, MUCH better Xizor figure that can stand (you can find it on Amazon at:Star Wars Clone Wars Action Figure Comic 2-Pack Dark Horse: Shadows of the Empire #5 Leia (Blue Gown) and Prince)."
2,If you really want to do yoga...........,"Don't buy this video if you really want to do yoga or tai-chi. You will be able to some of the exercises, but not all of them. The reason why is there are multiple girls doing the workout, and they use each other for their positions. So unless you have 2-3 naked people to work out with you, don't buy this!!!! Although I must say, I think the video was made for the sole purpose of exoticacy, and they did pull that off."
2,"Yoga No, Porn No ... Comedy YES!","This video delivers in neither the porn category nor the Yoga/Thai Chi category. So, as advertised, it basically a worthless video. However, on the unintentional comedy scale ... it rates a 10! Picture it in your minds eye: buck naked blondes and brunettes with silicone inflated breasts, deadly serious, staring each other ... with swords. Could you script something more inane? I know that this was expecting too much, but I was hoping, from a guy's perspective, that this video would be a solid workout with a little pizzaz. Instead, I have a stripped (pun intended) down version of the Three Stooges. Don't waste your money."
4,"Hilarious, Yet sensuously artful!","The yoga was very sensuous, yet funny when you're with a bunch of people that you can make amusing comments with. The women in the yoga part were absolutely magnificent.. very natural and beautiful.The Tai Chi part was the really funny part. The girls had probably never even heard of Tai Chi before. It was like the director said ""Act like a snake"".. and they did. However, the girls were sub-quality.. some fake body parts and out of shape. VERY funny though!"
4,Hammond Over Dose,"I am new to the music of James Taylor Quartet however a passionate about the particular keyboard Hammond sounds. Basically I follow all musicians that are still using the Hammond Keyboards.If you are a Hammond addict like me you will love this album. Great tracks played with the Hammond effect everywhere. Actually all the tracks are filled and sometimes overfilled with the Hammond sound making this album for the hardcore Hammond lovers ONLY.If you like the Hammond effect yet not with an over dose, I recommend:""The bigger picture"" for the same artist.""Second Wind"" for Oblivion express.""The Collection"" for Tony williams."
2,Not what expected..,"Bought for 5 year old grandson that loves airplane. Was recommended for children, but was too technical and only line drawings of airplane. Better books for identification."
4,Excellent betting strategies,"The power betting strategy is pays for the book probably thousands of times over. What puzzled me was the absolutely irrelevant information about ""scooters"" and ""sliders"" that followed. First half of the book was great....the rest killed time on the 5 hour flight back from Vegas. I wish I had read it going out!!!"
2,1 major error,"Page 53 - she refers to Ibsen as Danish (or leads one to believe he is). If someone has been studying/teaching Joyce/English literature for years, one would think the author would know that Ibsen is Norwegian and that Joyce taught himself the language.The book is well written and except for this one (what I would call major error), the author appears to know what she is talking about."
1,I am disappointed,"The drill worked OK at first except that the chuck is eccentric -- it wobbles,so the hole you get is bigger than the drill bit you're using. After about an hour of drilling time (not, of course, non-stop drilling), the trigger developed a dead spot wherein when I squeezed with gradually increasing pressure (so as to gradually increase drill speed), a few seconds into the ramp-up it quit -- just stopped cold. When that happened the first time, it just would not run again. The next day I tried it again, but except for one burst of full-speed running, it would not come on. (Outlets and cords checked out fine.)So overall it rates as very poor quality. I would not buy another."
4,Correction on country of origin,"I am posting because the product desription is not correct. Otherwise, it does appear as advertised. I cannot comment on the drill's performance because I have not used it yet...so my star rating doesn't count for much at this point...I will update this review when I start my first project.One of the reason's I bought it was the ""Made in USA"" description in the ""more technical details"" link...but when I got it, it said ""Manufactured in Mexico."" This may not matter to others, but it is better to be accurately informed before you buy...also, a case would be a nice addition for such a nice-looking and powerful tool! Good luck to all!"
3,Try the switch before you buy,"The ergonomics of the tool are pretty decent and the keyed chuck is quite solid. However, the variable speed feature could use some improvement. At lower speeds, there is almost no torque and when the trigger is pressed a little more to compensate, it revs to full speed. There is very little working range to the variable speed feature. There is also a little more vibration than I would have expected.I'd often wonder why other folks on construction sites (who were using DeWalt drills) either pulsed the drilling or ran the drill at full speed. Now I know. I also know why they would prefer using my Bosch and Milwaukee drills.This tool was a gift and will be a backup for my other drills. If you are doing delicate work or need to drill at a steady speed, I would not recommend this drill. Both Bosch and Milwaukee have superior variable-speed switches and run more smoothly (although they cost a little more)."
4,OK Judy Moody,This book was good. My favorite part was when she hits the teacher's elbow. That made me laugh!
2,disappointment,Wasn't really worth the time watching. Good item to add to your history channel collection. Gave no good information or showed anything exciting. Just talked about mysteries. Nothing to have you on the edge of your seat.
1,Lousy Toy,"I bought this for my 10 month-old son but its a bad choice. There is not much to do with this toy, no input for the little ones,just pop and the ball goes up and down by itself that's the only delight to see. Plus it uses up batteries which are size ""D""-4 of them which is not less than $5-6. I m just gonna return it."
1,Disappointment,"I purchased this toy for my daughter last year when she was 22 months old. It's a good idea but there were several things that I didn't like about it. First, it's a very noisy toy. It has a blower on it (to blow the toys in the air) along with the very loud music. Between both, it's like having a blow dryer on. Also, it's very heavy. Much to heavy for a just walking toddler. My daughter was a little older and would try to pick it up and a couple of times dropped it on her toe...tears!! Furthermore, it really blows the balls around so of course you are fetching the balls from under the sofa or chair."
2,its...,an okay toy... nothing to jump out of ur seat for tho... my son plays with it for about 5 mins... and plays more with the on/off button when he does... nonetheless ok toy... btw... my balls were different to the ones in the photo... no biggie just an observation...
3,I had more fun than my daughter!,"I was more excited by this than my 15 month-old. It would be great if the balls stayed in, but they don't. There is absolutely no educational value in it. If I need a fast distraction for my daughter, it works for 5 minutes. I recommend buying your child educational books instead of wasting money on this toy"
3,LOUD!,This seems like a great toy. The combination of the fan and music however is a little scary for my 9-month old nephew. He's not usually easily startled. The box says 9-months to whenever. It may be a good idea to wait a couple more months.
3,TOO MUCH CHASING OF THE BALLS,"Just received as a birthday present for 1 year old. Was so surprised at how fast and how much of the time the balls don't stay in the toy and are all over the floor. Even tried to re adjust chutes but didn't help, Either I have a defective toy or it is way too much trouble to keep chasing the balls to put back. Would not recommend."
3,"Fun for Kids, Disliked by Parents","My 11-month-old son LOVES this toy; on the other hand, I HATE this toy and let out a very audible groan when I hear him turn it on. My son is enthralled with the loud music, ball action and the ""floating"" ball at the top of the vacuum tube. Unfortunately, the toy manufacturer made this toy where it shoots the balls all over creation. So the child sits there, enthralled with the toy, while mommy scrambles to catch, corral and find the brightly colored balls under and behind every imaginable piece of furniture. No balls and the child is disinterested in the toy. We've managed to maintain contact on all five balls, but I think they may mysteriously disappear soon. ;)"
4,great entertainment but...,"This is a great toy to keep your kids busy. It only takes a couple of tries to get the balls up, if the batteries are not tottaly full its not going.If your kid by exitment puts the wrong ball it that is a little bigger its a huge hassle trying to get it out. Unscrewing cracked ours a little.It was a nice gift and nice entertainment for my son!"
1,Too loud. Doesn't work,"There is no volume switch so the only setting is, ""obnoxiously loud"". There are 5 balls, and if there are not 5 balls in the tunnel below, none of the rest will be pushed up through the popper. So then you have loud noise/music and balls that are stuck. Whenever the balls do fly up for the first time, they collide mid-air, knocking at least 1 across the room. So the rest of the balls never get pushed out since the balls don't go back down the way they are supposed to. So now I have to give away a toy...once I find the rest of the balls that disappeared. Save your money, and play catch with your kid."
4,Musical and exciting for baby,"My son really loved this ball popper when we first got it. More than the actual popping of the balls, he seemed to love sticking anything that would fit into the chute. I constantly had to turn it over to clear it out. Besides that, the only issue I have with it is that the force of the air pushing the balls up makes the balls fly all over the place. The only way to keep the cycle of balls going up the chute, dropping down and going through the whole thing again is if only two or three balls are used. One of them must be hovering above the air hole when another comes up to push it aside and fall down. In spite of all that, I think it was exciting for my son when all the balls we had in it would fly all over the place. Just not fun for mommy to retrieve them!"
1,waste of money,there is no interaction and the balls pop out everywhere. my son was bored with it in 5 minutes. i couldn't even sell the thing at a garage sale!
3,gift,"for my granddaughter, she liked the noise and action of the item, kept her occupied at times for a while"
3,Great for kids and a pain for parents,"The balls go everywhere and sometimes the air pressure isn't enough to get the balls popping. However, it teaches kids that if you put the balls in and press the button, the balls will entertainingly come popping out. Highly recommended toy to stay at a sitter's or grandparent's house!"
2,Not a Hit,"Got this toy for our granddaughter, who's a little over a year old. Not only did the music startle her, there's not much interactivity involved (aside from chasing the balls as they roll all over the place). From an adult point of view, the Popper is well made, but the music is really loud & annoying. I gave this one away and got her a Super Spiral Tower, which is kid- rather than battery-powered and which allows her to access the balls, etc., and drop them down the chute herself rather than just watching them move inside the Popper's clear plastic tube."
3,Defective,"This is probably a fun toy, but ours was defective. The orange ramp is too narrow and the balls get stuck as the roll down. I am hoping that a replacement fixes this problem."
3,Fun but not too much learning involved,This product is fun and the music goes well with it but you need to be careful as the balls pop out quickly and it is difficult for a small child 9-10 months to grab them and put them back into the stream if one pops out. In addition one could pop out and hit your child in the eye if you are not careful. Also you don't really educational. The balls just pop out and go around the loop. Plus there is no volume control and the music is pretty loud.
3,Love it at Playgroups - wish ours worked!,"Our daughter LOVES playing with this toy at friends houses. We ordered one for her for Christmas, but were disappointed that it was defective. Amazon promptly sent us a replacement, but it had the same defect (the fan only worked the first time you pressed the bar, after that, it didn't stay on. To Amazon's credit, their policy is to not send replacements when there are consecutive defects. We got a full refund and will buy it again (probably at a local store instead).). All of our friend's toys worked great - nice strong fan that blows the balls up and out of the tube, accompanied by music. Our daughter had a blast trying to catch the balls as they pop up out of the tube, and it was a fun game having to chase after the occasional strays that didn't land in the catch tray."
4,Fun to watch,"I bought this product for my daughter around christmas time and she was only nine months old. At first she wasn't exactly sure what to make of it, but it didn't take her long to figure it out. She is now trying to put the balls in herself and has already learned to push the botton to activate the product. The best part is watching her giggle and squeal when the balls pop out of the top unexpectantly. I have friends with kids who are in their todler years and they absolutly love to play with the toy when they came over.The toy itself seems to be made well. Sometimes if you don't have all of the balls in the ones that are in have a more difficult time popping out by themselves. And make sure that you are using new 'D' batteries. Other than that I'm glad that I purchased this product and I think that my daughter will get quite a bit of play time out of the toy over the next several years."
4,My twins love this toy,I have 18 mo old twins and this toy is still one of their favorites after 6 mo of playing with it. They still laugh out loud every time they turn it on and they fight over it from time to time-which I think is a complement for any toy maker. Hours of fun for all.
2,A good workout for mom as I go chasing balls around the house,"This is a cute toy and when the balls pop up and actually land back in the yellow dish, it's a lot of fun. My 9 month old giggles at it, even though he doesn't get what to do with it really.My big beef with it is that the balls rarely go back in the toy, they usually pop up and fly across the room. I spent the good part of the first hour with this toy just chasing balls down in the hardest to reach parts of my house (the balls must have some sort of sensor that attracts them to the furthest corner under the couch).Since the balls are never near the toy, the kid doesn't get to play with them much. It's a good work out for me though.It's also really annoyingly loud and obnoxious in the sound effects department."
2,A royal pain in the butt,"My nearly 2 year old twins love this toy but I hate it. The balls end up everywhere and they try to shove all of their small toys and their arms (up to their shoulders) down the chute. We have had numerous toys stuck in the popper and they are practically impossible to get out. The balls fly everywhere and the popper doesn't work as well unless all of the balls are in it. On the plus side, this toy plays fun songs and seems to be durable."
4,Keeps 'em busy,"I initially got this toy for my daughter when she was one year old, and she didnt have an interest in it and could not understand how to get it going. Now that she's two, wow! She loves the music (though I think the fan that runs the toy is a little loud), the movement, and the different places to put the balls. The balls are just the right size for little hands, too. Just as soon as she sits down and the balls get going, one may bounce out across the floor - so she's up and down, retrieving balls, putting them in, turning the toy on, what more could you ask to keep a toddler busy!!?? She thinks its alot of fun.Note - if you loose some balls, you can order them from Hasboro in sets of 5."
4,17 month old,"I got this for my 17 month old neice for Christmas. It was by far her favorite! It was easy for her to play with, she learned how to get it started up by herself within minutes."
3,Strange Ball Popper,"Well, at first this toys was acceptable for my son. The music is fun. The balls fly too far up into the air and roll all over the place! My son can't keep up with them and neither can I! Also, at 9 months or so may son developed a fear of this toy. I think it is the noise- it is quite noisy."
2,Inconsistent fun for 22 month old,"My 22 month old Daughter received this for Christmas. I was concerned that it would be too young for her, but she was definitely very taken with it. The music is fairly charming in small doses, and my daughter enjoys naming the colors of all the balls as they pop up.My low rating comes from the fact that the balls are very inconsistent. sometimes they stick in the channel part, so they just sit there and don't get blown up, other times they blow so hard they fly all over the room. Overall I'm just not very impressed with the playability of this toy."
5,Lots of fun!,My dd is 15 months and has had this toy for 3 months and she still enjoys it. Its one of her favorite toys. The balls ocasionally get lost but we find them :) Overall its a great toy! But a little loud but its worth it!
5,Hours of Great FUN!,"We got this toy for my daughters 1st birthday she just turned 3 last month, Sadly our dog chewed all the balls to it other wise it held up great. Many drops,bangs, and booms! We are actually getting another for Christmas for our 1 year old since they Enjoyed it so much."
3,"Good concept, crappy implementation","Well as a concept, this was a really good toy. My daughter really loved it - pushing the balls in, watching them pop up and chasing them all over the floor. Unfortunately it only worked for 2 days. At first I thought it was the batteries, but after changing the batteries and checking the contacts, it still didn't work. Wasn't worth the effort at all"
3,My son's favorite toy,My son got this toy at 11 months. He quickly learned how to turn it on. he would watch the balls fly all over. I would run around picking them up. in just a few weeks HE was crawling around picking them up. It was really the first time I had seen him pick up any of his toys. He also loves to try to stop the balls from coming out. It is a GREAT toy and I thank my cousin weekly. It is also small enough to take with us. Enjoy
3,"Fun toy, but tips easily...","My daughter had a blast with this toy at a party, but after I purchased it for her I realized the downfalls... It's fun and entertaining, but the base isn't wide enough, thus it tips easily. Considering the age range, you can be guaranteed that it will be on it's side more than not. Despite this, it is a lot of fun. Great for the price."
1,Absolutely Worthless,"I received the Hasbro Playskool Busy Ball Popper two days ago and was very excited about my son playing with it. Unfortunately the toy is completely unusable. First, there is very little interaction; second, the balls pop all over the place and the adult has to go and chase them all over the place."
1,TARGET IS UNRELIABLE,"TARGET IS UNRELIABLE, July 26, 2009By Y. Lin ""Nikos"" (DC) - See all my reviewsDurability: Fun: Educational:I ordered this item over 14 days ago for a birthday boy whose birthday is this coming Saturday. I despise leaving things until the last minute. Since I paid for the darn thing and it was in stock, I crossed this off my to do list. Today I review my to do list and realise it has not arrived. IT HAS NOT EVEN BEEN SHIPPED! Watch out for ordering things from Target as it seems to be highly unreliable"
1,"After 2 months I had to toss it out, lots of problems!","First of all, if you loose the balls you can't buy replacement balls. If the cheep plastic balls get smashed they wont go threw the tunnel any more. The thing keeps falling apart! The top always comes off. And my biggest gripe, boy does this thing suck batteries!!! You may as well take them to Chucky Cheese for all the money you will spend on battteries. Get the Fisher Price Giraffe ball toy instead, way better!"
4,Very Cute,"My son is 7 months old, he looks at this toy like it's completely crazy. He just got it, so he's not into how it works yet. He does really like the balls and carries them around while he crawls. It's a cute toy though and seems like it's built well. It shuts off in a good time frame as well do it's not making you crazy."
1,Beware of PVC in this toy,"I just returned this toy (& the Hasbro Busy Basics Busy Ball Choo Choo) after discovering it contains PVC. A Hasbro Playskool customer service representative confirmed the presence of PVC. As a new parent, I've learned that PVC is dangerous to a child's health and that many US companies are voluntarily going PVC-free and many European countries have banned it. Not all plastics are dangerous which is why I initially purchased this toy but when it arrived I was surprised to discover that characteristic smell (like shower curtains) and soft plastic."
4,Creates Non-Stop Giggles,"This may be my one year old son's favorite toy. Even after owning it for month's, it still sends him into a fit of giggles each time it gets turned on! I do have to do a lot of ball retrieving from under the furniture and when the batteries start to die, you have to put your hand over the top to create suction so the balls will pop out. Overall though, this toy has held up well and most importantly our son loves it!"
4,My son loves this toy!,My son got this toy for his 1st birthday. It took him a bit to learn how to push the plunger but once he did...oh boy! He is now 17 mos and still loves to play with this. He puts his shapes in there and has even put his pinwheel by the air to make it go. My only gripe is that the balls sometimes go everywhere and he loses interest in chasing them and bringing them back. I highly recommend this toy! My son loves it!
4,Fun little Toy,"It's a great toy with music and the balls go crazy and it's just a bunch of fun for my children. The only problems I see is that it tips over very very easy. Good thing it's not heavy. I know the balls are supposted to go all over the place, it just isn't a lot of fun having to chase balls falling all over the places and rolling under furniture and stuff. But it is a lot of fun and worth the money."
5,Very fun for toddlers,"My daughter LOVES this toy. She recieved it as a gift on her first birthday and has figured out how to start the balls popping. This toy keeps her entertained for a long time. If your child loves balls, which mine does then they will really enjoy this toy. My five year old loves to play this with her baby sister so it really is a wonderful toy."
4,"Fun toy, but the batteries don't last long...","My daughter got this toy as a gift when she was about 5 months old. She loves to watch the balls pop out and laughs really hard when her 5 yr old brother goes running after them. The only problem I had with this toy was the fact that the batteries die VERY quickly. After only about 10 plunger hits we noticed a considerable change in performance. ""D"" size batteries don't come cheap but we've replaced them several times so that my daughter could enjoy her toy."
2,Frightening music,"I thought this would be a lot of fun, but the music is so loud and aggressive. It is the thing my 11 month old has every been afraid of. There is no volume switch."
2,"Kids enjoyed, but balls promptly were trashed.","I got this for my 2 year old. Both he and his 4 year old brother found it entertaining. It is also good practice for little ones to place an object into a small hole (fine motor skills). Problems with it though: my 2 year old, who still chews on things. promptly destroyed all the balls. This toy is intended for babies and babies mouth their toys, so I think the balls should have been able to handle it. This toy is also loud without volume control. Heads up--takes 4 D batteries that aren't included."
2,Not What I Expected For My 9-month-old,"We puchased this toy for our 9-month-old and ended up returning it to the store. The concept and the looks of this toy are great, but as mentioned in other reviews, this toy is pretty noisy. It's so noisy that we were afraid it could affect our daughter's attention or hearing. The toy does not come with volume control, and the music can be annoying to some people like us. Moreover,the motor to create the force to blow out the balls runs so loud that it ruins the whole fun intention of this toy."
3,busy ball popper,Ok toy for my 6 month and 2 year old. Daugther jammed something in it the first time out- needed long tweezers to dislodge. Balls fly out and not always get back into the hole and roll across the floor. Fun music and turns itself off after use. Pretty fun; keeps them occupied for a little while.
3,Fun...but tired of chasing balls!!,My 12 month old loves this toys and laughs every time it gets turned on. I would give this toy 5 stars but it is poorly designed. The balls fly out of the machine and go all over the house. A nightmare on our entirely tiled floor.
5,This Toy Rocks! So much fun...,My kids took to it right away. All kids who come over check it out and enjoy it. And adults want to try it. I think it's great. It's dynamic - meaning there is music and action - so it's not a quiet time toy - but it's exciting and fun and interesting. I just hope we don't lose the balls...
5,POP UP BALL GAME,I PURCHASED THIS TOY FOR MY LITTLE GRANDSON. HE LOVES IT!. THE BALLS ARE MADE OF PLASTIC SO THEY ARE NOT DANGEROUS. THE BALLS START POPPING AND MUSIC STARTS PLAYING. DEFINITELY WOULD RECOMMEND THIS TOY. A LOT OF FUN!
4,Good,My sister-in-law had one of these and my toddler played with it forever. I was excited to get it. All of my other six kids have had a turn trying it out. It seems to call your name to come play. It has had a lot of use from big kids and doesn't seem to blow out the balls as well as it first did.
4,Very pleased with the Gregg Shorthand Manual,I ordered the Gregg Shorthand Manual. The book was in very good condition. This book is not for a beginner. The reader would have to have studied shorthand previously for the book to be useful to them.I received the book in a matter of days. I was very pleased with the experience.
4,Never thought shorthand would be useful!,"In this digital age, it was hard to believe that shorthand is still useful. With all the changes going on the work environment, I'm finding that shorthand is once again a skill in demand. Not so much for taking minutes (although that happens with confidential meetings), but just being able to write instructions as rapidly as a task is being demonstrated, taking notes for phone calls, etc., is proving to be very useful indeed. This book makes it possible to learn shorthand without having to take a class (which I should have done in high school!)."
4,Deadend of Besiegers,"The movie is fun to watch. Takes you to Japan and China. As some of the subject matter is predictable, its still a very good movie. I would say at the very least 3 and a half stars. The fights are pretty good, and the acting is believable. The only thing I didn't like was they should have shown Ogawa return to Japan and fight the foreigner.Still a movie to watch and the DVD is excellent."
3,IN DASH KIT,"Fit the car's dash panels perfect. The opening don't fit single DIN stereo, I did little filing to fit it, I also used hot melt glue (epoxy will be better. be prepared) other wise, GOOD product, price, appearance and fast delivery.Thanks."
2,Cute idea...lousy product,We purchased this at an upscale toy store in the Indianapolis area for my daughter's birthday. The spinner never worked (flimsy plastic inside cardboard insert...won't stay in for 9 out of 10 attempts at a spin. The colorform stickers themselves never did stick to the cardboard much and DEFINITELY did not stick back on the waxed paper where you're ostensibly supposed to store them. I've read other reviews suggesting that the formula or approach to manufacturing must have changed over the years as the new colorforms don't stick as well as the old. That's definitely my experience - this was as bad or worse as a heavily used set we bought at a garage sale when ours was fresh out of the box.Pretty disappointing...thankfully my daughters don't seem to mind as much as my wife and I do when we attempt to play the game with them.
5,Great fun for all ages,"This is great fun and my ""go to"" gift item for children around 3 - 4 yrs old. We love to play this game with our daughter. She received it when she was 3 years old. She is now 7 and still pulls it out to play. We love to laugh at the silly combinations of hair, eyes, ears, mouth & nose. Hint: We kept the stick-on pages in tact (ie we didn't peel off the cut out template) so we could easily return the stick-ons back to their original places. This keeps things organized so we can easily play over and over again."
5,Scary Monsters stands up over time,"No extras, just a great way to update the media on one of the greats by one of the great artists of our generation"
3,"I know it should be all about the MUSIC, but...","The remastering here is biased to the treble, and overall is rather cool and lean sounding. I know part of this is a ""Bowie Sound"" thing, but really...I am just saying, if you have some audiophilic leanings, this will give you a headache, as, I am told, will the other Virgin re-issues.Even some of the LP versions were recorded this way, so no relief there...I use my disc to keep my mug off the coffee table."
1,Junk!!!,I agree with the other three reviews. This is a piece of JUNK. Somebody should use these clippers on the people who wrote the instructions for use and see how they like it when you cut their nails into the quick! OUCH!
1,Too good to be true,"I could not believe this item existed. I thought it was a life saver as both of my dogs fear nail clipping, actually I fear it more than they do as I have cut a quick in the past and felt guilty for years. Followed the simple instructions, but the green light would turn green too early, any common sense person would know that this would be wrong, but what about if it was someone's first dog and did not know better about the quick, they would cut the nail too short and hurt the dog. The light would turn red where there was no quick.in brief: Waste of money, possibility of hurting your dog even more, very disappointing!"
1,Worthless!!!,Not even close to being accurate. Buy the regular clippers because that is all this is good for anyways and this cost way to much!!!
1,AWFUL product,"I saw this product and thought it would be a very helpful tool. My dog is a small mixed breed dog with black nails. She had one bad experience at the groomer where one of her quicks was cut and she's terrified of getting her nails trimmed now. I thought this tool would help me do the job at home, quick and painlessly. The concept is nice, but the product itself is awful. I put the tool at the base of her nail as instructed and the green light (meaning: it's okay to cut the nail now) came on immediately. wtf? Our dog has two white nails where the quick is easily seen-- so I tried it on those nails, and it was telling me to cut her nails when the tool was obviously over the quick. awful, awful awful product. Please do not buy this."
1,Waste of money,"We bought this to use on our pets and it was horrible! The light would turn red no matter where on the nail it was, and the clipper wouldn't even cut the nail. I would not recommend this to anyone!"
3,CLIP THE NAILS,ANOTHER ONE OF THOSE COMPUTER(?) THINGIES. KIND OF TOUCHY SO YOU STILL HAVE TO BE CAREFUL USING IT. DON'T WANT TO CUT THE QUICK!
1,Horrible Product,"I bought the clipper for large dogs. I have two german shepherds, and the blade was so crappy it wouldn't cut the nails at all. My poor dog screamed when I tried to cut. Then I tried it on my cat, thinking it would be easier, and it wouldn't even clip my cat's nails! I'm returning the product. Save your money."
1,Simply does not work,"I was excited about this product as it seemed to address every pet owner's worst nightmare - cutting the quick when trimming your pet's nails. Unfortunately the product simply does not work. I tried using the method shown both in the product manual (which wasn't very good to begin with) and thought that maybe I was doing something wrong. I then watched the instruction video on the product website and followed the directions exactly. The device always showed red and never displayed a safe to cut green light. I tried it on all three of our dogs, two with dark nails, one with light. In a nutshell, don't buy this product. I would recommend looking at the Dremel nail trimmer instead. We've had a much better experience with the Dremel (also available on Amazon for a great price).Dremel 761-03 7,000/14,000 RPM Cordless Pet Nail Grooming Rotary Tool"
1,Poor Right Angle Drill,"I purchased this drill two years ago when it first came out. While this drill is certainly heavy duty, it has been a disappointment. It has a very dangerous switch which is easily turned on when you are working in awkward positions, as typical with right angle drills. Also, it lacks variable speed and reverse which was not clear in the description when I bought it. My brother has a Milwaukee (made by Sioux) right angle drill which is hands down better which I would recommend instead."
4,Zonenet Laptop Combo Bus Card,This laptop bus card provides all the connections I need for USB 2.0 ports and firewire ports. It has worked flawlessly so far. Good price and quick shipping from Amazon. Thanks.
2,it's not worth it,"this product is only good if you are going to plug in another powered device, like a camera or printer. i bought this because i only have usb 1 on my laptop and wanted the 2.0 for my unpowered external hard drive. it will not power the hard drive so i'm stuck using my usb1 port again. i couldn't get a hold of customer service to find out about buying a power cable for this item and there is nothing listed on their web site. this product does work without problems for my memory stick and digital camera."
4,Seems to be a good video card!,"Hello To All: Let it be know that [...] was the provider in this transaction of purchase, Which Went Very Well Thank You Amazon. The Video Card seems to be doing quite well, Here is to hoping it last a long time. Great So Far!SincerelyMr Harrris"
4,"Pleasing mixture of old songs and new, vocals and the band","I am new to both June and to the Oyster Band (I don't get around much, I guess...thank goodness for my friend Jim Clark of Missouri who turned me on to both of them.) This is a delightful album. There is another review posted for this one which seems quite sensible to me, so read it. The traditional ""Susie Clellan"" and the punkish ""Lullaby of London"" by Shane MaGowan of the Pogues are my favorites, I think...but it's all good."
4,Crown Jewels,"With influences ranging from Big Star to Built To Spill, Tiara has created a real low-fi gem.""Titletron"" ebbs and flows nicely (especially on songs like ""Waiting For Blue Skies"" and ""The Living""). Harmonies blend in with the hooks and riffs with ease.Tiara is one of the best kept secrets in the indie world. Check this record out if your into bands like Built To Spill (among others) it's worth a listen."
4,Would Be Five Stars But For One Thing,"This DVD and the VHS that was released years ago are great. You get all of Meat Loaf's music videos from his first three albums, except the Dead Ringer for Love video. This video is notable because the song is a duet with Cher and Cher fans have been wanting good quality copies of that video for years. Not to mention the Meat Loaf fans who also want it. Even without that video, the DVD is a great buy and a must have for all Meat Loaf fans. I just hope that eventually we get a DVD for the videos from the albums, Bad Attitude, Blind Before I Stop, Bat Out of Hell 2 and Welcome to the Neighborhood."
5,meatloaf at his best,"one of the things i like about meatloaf is that he puts a lot of feelings and drama into his music and videos. sometimes i feel like i'm watching opera when i see him perform, either on video or live performance. it is absolutely wonderful!"
1,Not compatible with the TR555LC,Despite what the description says this paddle is not compatible with the Breadman TR555LC. The TR555LC uses a half moon spindle and this is for a spindle that is flat on two sides.
1,good torque but otherwise.......,I went out and got this for a deck I was putting up. After owning the DeWalt DW 257 for 24 hours and using it to screw down 5/8 pressure treated deck boards to 2X12 joists the thing wrung itself completely in half. Immagine the look on the clerks face when I returned the gear/ clutch assembly in one hand and the body in the other. Needless to say I got a refund and bought something else. While I love my DeWalt framing nailer and a DeWalt/ Emglo compressor I'm now leary of buying yellow....
2,A Hybrid Tool with compromised Drywall performance,"As a remodeling contractor, I bought this DeWalt model primarily for drywall, and find it way too high powered for that application. The RPMs are too high for setting screws other in an open field (I found myself dropping this DeWalt tool and picking up my old cordless 3/8"" Makita variable speed reversable all-purpose drill to set screw in corners and along joints where I needed better control and lower RPMs than the DeWalt would give me). This DeWalt may work for deck screws, but I never gave it a chance for that application before dropping it from my tool collection so frustrated with its drywall application. Hybrid tools are compromises - If you want a drywall screwdriver, buy one that's designed only for that purpose."
1,Not Enchanted,"Considering that Charlotte Church received a 20 million dollar contract, I would have expected something better from her for her 4th album. She attempts to sing songs which are the most difficult to date with a voice which is not as good as it once was. So I guess you could say that I am disenchanted. Charlotte needs to get focused and sing songs which her voice will support. With the exception of Carrickfergus, they were not to be found here."
1,Twinke Twinkle Little Star - Now No One Knows Just Where U R,"Having heard all of Charlotte's albums, I'm now a little confused on just where she is, musicly speaking. She has tried classical, opera, religious, Christmas, and now she is doing Broadway and Hollywood. She needs to stay with a specific genre long enough to establish an identity there. She is not showing any improvement anywhere because she is not there long enough to improve. You can go only so far with a high-volume two-octave sound. She needs to start refining her voice and settle into a specific musical genre. Once she has an identity there, she will be able to develop a permanent fan base with which she can establish a career. Otherwise, she will continue to move to another genre without ever having mastered the previous one. C'MON AND GET IT TOGETHER CHARLOTTE!!!!"
1,Simply Cannot Enjoy,"I have spent far more time reading the various reviews on this CD than I am spending writing one. The music critics take issue with Charlotte's ability to sing, while her fans say just listen and enjoy. I have listened to all that Amazon has provided and have conluded that Charlotte was way to young to have attempted the very complex (musically speaking) songs on this CD. This would be the equivalent of a Middle School boy in the roll of Stanley Kowalski in a Streetcar Named Desire. He simply would not be able to do justice to the role, which is why SND is never done in middle or high schools. Accordingly, Charlotte should not have attempted these complex Hollywood-type pieces. They require too much and I simply could not enjoy someone singing them who simply is not old enough yet to have developed the necessary skills to do justice to them. For fans who love her only."
2,Delightful voice but...,"Unquestionably Charlotte Church has a phenomenal voice for her age, however, she is a bit out of her league with many of the selections here. In ""If I Loved You,"" and ""Laughing Song,"" oneeagerly waits for her to launch into the depths of these wonderful pieces, but she doesn't quite get there. A bit like trying to fly an ultra-light along side a B52. ""Bali Hai"" has the desired dreamy quality, and the orchestrations are marvelous.It would be interesting if Miss Church would re-record these in ten years."
1,Why This??????,"Considering the tragic manner in which Charlotte Church lost her voice, its a shame that they had to try and make another album with her with what little voice she has left. She simply doesn't have the necessary vocal components to sing anything in Enchantment with the exception of Carrickfergus.If she is intent on continuing to sing with such a pedestrian voice, then she should at least seek out material which is consistent with that voice. To try and cover some of Hollywoods most famous ballads with nothing more than a High School voice is a disservice to the entire music community and a black mark on Miss Church's career, assuming she still has one.Enchantment serves as an example of what music not to sing on an album when you don't have the voice."
1,Catch a Falling Star,"After listening to Enchantment at a listening station at Tower Records, I must agree with those who say that Charlotte is losing her voice. Both the energy and volume are lacking from previous works. The songs which are included in this CD from film and stage need far more attention than Charlotte now is able to give to them. The result is a rendering which just doesn't measure up. Even some fancy studio work is unable to mask the reality here and that is that Charlotte is no longer a legitimate recording artist like she was with her first album. Somebody needs to do something in an effort to salvage her voice before she can't sing at all. Hearing her in Enchantment is a tragedy considering that she was once on top of the world as a 12-year-old. I would suggest that anyone interested in hearing Charlotte when she could sing check out her Voice of an Angel CD. Then you will be able to relate to this review a little more."
5,It's the Voice that Counts,Charlotte church is a clean-cut girl that sells her voice more than her image. She is a beautiful person and sings with words of inspiration and hope. Her songs are easy to understand. Her since of stlye is MODEST and at the same time up to date. You can clearly tell that Charlotte has a gift of song. Enchantment lifts your spirit and helps you relax and enjoy yourself. Charlotte started singing at a very young age and captured the hearts of thousands with her intelligence and her stunning voice. She is well on her way to success. Her personality shines through and she will go far.
3,Ok......but,"Overall,this CD is good. If she's supposed to be an opera singer, she needs a lot more training. The music she sang from Carmen was butchered. She shouldn't be singing ""Can't Help Lovin' Dat Man"", because she could barley hit any of the high notes. She needs to take some time off to improve her voice. She should come back when she's really ready to truthfully says she's an opera singer."
1,The Girl Next Door,"When I was first told of Charlotte Church, I was told she would remind me of the girl next door. After listening to Enchantment, I can now express a concuring opinion. Unfortunately, as with the girl next door,that opinion is somewhat less than flattering. The songs were nice as were the instrumentals and background vocals. However, Charlotte sounded out of place on this album. She simply doesn't have the overall vocal quality or professional ability to control her voice in a manner which the songs on the album require. As a matter of fact, I am seriously considering contacting her and trying to set up a duet with the girl next door to me. After all, birds of a feather should flock together. If this were Charlotte's first album, I might suggest trying it so as to see what the new kid on the block sounds like. However as a 4th album, this will not tell anyone anything. Other reviewers indicate her best stuff is behind her so that is where anyone interested should look."
2,Wrong Singer,"I love the songs on this album, but the singing was terrible. Charlotte Church, whomever that is, does not appear destined to make a career with her voice. I give this 4 for the material and a 1 for singing. On balance, a 2 seems fair."
1,Not a Storyteller,"The songs which are being sung in Enchantment were primarily stories and messages being told to an audience. However, to tell these stories, an artist needs to develop empathy with his/her audience. That appears to be lacking here with Charlotte Church. To just go out and sing a song in a recording studio without a vision of what or to whom you are singing or communicaiting leaves a song as just so many words. Possibly Charlotte is not old enough yet to have developed these skills. But, if this is the case, she should not have been allowed to attempt these songs. It just leaves the listener with an empty feeling."
3,"Pleasant, but not great","I purchased this CD on the strength of some of the reviews here and I will say that I am not unhappy about the purchase, but I believe those who give this CD 5 stars are overrating it. Charlotte Church sings nice enough, but so do many amateur singers appearing all over the country in community theaters. She has a nice voice and does a good job, but is far from the top echelon of professional singers. This CD is pleasant to listen to while reading a book or something. Just don't put it in your CD player so that Sarah Brightman is the next CD to play automatically. Charlotte Church pales in comparison. I would probably buy another CD by Charlotte Church."
1,What a Downer,"Charlotte sounds like she's losing her voice in Enchantment. Also, she must be losing her mind if she thinks that she can take her school-girl voice and sing classics like Tonight and Habanera. She sounds rediculous. This one belongs squarely in the middle of the trash recepticle. Don't think twice about it."
1,SHOCKED!,"I was asked to review this CD by a friend, who wanted a 2nd opinion before authoring a negative review. There is not much I could say that hasn't already been said. Given the studio and the production which went into this album, I feel that I could have performed equally as well as Charlotte. She simply is not a high level professional singer. She is a school girl and sounds like it. Save your $ for better music. It simply couldn't have been any worse here."
1,Why So Soon???,"After her previous album, Charlotte had indicated that she would not make another album for quite awhile. After listening, to Enchantment, I can see that she should have kept her word. She is having great vocal difficulty and this album is really an embarrassment. Hopefully Sony will give her a rest so that she can recuperate and mature. I know that she is capable of better, but she needs to be given the chance. Otherwise we will end with another Enchantment which is of no benefit to the music world. Charlotte needs to take a lesson from Mariah Carey. Burnout is possible at any age."
1,Nice Try But Wrong Turn,"It was nice to see Charlotte try and break out of her choir-girl image by trying something new. But trying to sing the classic show songs that are in Enchantment was a bad idea. As many have noted, she doesn't have that mature range or control needed for those types of songs. The Irish folk song Carrickfergus comes across O K so maybe she should have stuck with those types of songs. But the rest of the songs just don't cut it for those with any type of musical taste. Some people have mentioned pop and that is probably a good idea. However she needs to do something quick as most people have a negative feeling from Enchantment. Possibly another album this Summer doing some pop covers would get her back on track."
5,To Mr. Stearns.......,"I am really enjoying Ms. Church's latest album and I can't wait to hear her next work....I doubt Mr. Stearns will ever read this but, I was just wondering if he would like to recant.Enjoy eating your crow Mr. Stearns, because I think you will be eating it for a long time to come. ;-)"
1,Disappointed,"I was very disappointed after listening to many of the selections from the Enchantment album. I had been told that Charlotte Church was an opera star, but I could not see that from what I heard here. She does not have the strength of voice to sing opera. The singing here is very ordinary and not worthy of the popular songs which she attempts."
2,Written for Older Singers,"For a girl of 15, Charlotte Church does a reasonably good job on these show songs on Enchantment. However, these songs were written for mature adult singers; thus Charlotte's very young sounding voice is conspicuously weak on most of the tunes. She seems to be O.K. on ""Carrickfergus"", a Celtic ballad, but then on ""The Water is Wide"", another Celtic ballad, she again sounds very weak and clearly inferior to the version done live on the Lilith Fair CD by Sarah McLachlan, Jewel, and the Indigo Girls.Charlotte is not ready to sing the songs on Enchantment yet and needs to focus on those songs her voice is NOW ready to accomodate. I do not recommend this album."
1,Too Many Genre's,"I was referred over here from the Josh Groban page and have just listened to what was provided by ... . I really couldn't get into Charlotte Church's singing because she attempted to sing in too many genres. She sounds O.K. singing Carrick Fergus, an Irish Folk Ballad, but she then tries various classical and show tunes for which she doesn't seem suited right now. I guess she gave it a try but if falls far short of what you might expect with material like this. Her duet with Groban is a good showcase for Groban, but she sounds overwhelmed by a far superior and more mature voice. She should stick with Irish folk."
1,Get this girl some REAL voice lessons...,"This album is anything BUT 'enchanting'. The only good song on this entire CD is ""The Prayer"" and it's only saved by the amazing Josh Groban, who knows what he's doing with his voice.I admit I was amazed when Charlotte first came out with ""Voice of an Angel"" only because 13-year-olds usually do not have that type of range. I was also anticipating what was to come as her voice developped. Now that she's older, she trying to sound like she's a 30-year-old opera singer, which she is definately not. She sings from the very back of her throat instead of her diaphram so there is a definate lack of support and her vibrato is so forced it makes me gag.Charlotte's version of ""Can't Help Lovin' That Man"" was probably the final blow before I had to rip this CD from my CD player.Save your money and if you want an amazing classical singer, go for Renee Flemming or Sumi Jo. If you want popera, go with Josh Groban."
1,Disappointment,"Maybe I was expecting too much from a 16-year-old, but this CD certainly doesn't deliver what Charlotte Church had the reputation for and that was a dynamic driving voice that could pierce the night unamplified. What I heard on Enchantment was a mediocre school-girl voice which seemed out of place on a Columbia album. I have heard rumors to the effect that she has lost her voice and listening to Enchantment does nothing to dispell those rumors. If she can't improve on her next album, she should seriously consider retiring from singing."
5,A Garden of Song,"I was actually afraid when my girlfriend gave me Enchanment as a gift that I would not be able to stand it and what could I tell her?. She has played some of the early Church Cd's for me and they were not my style. I can't say I like all the songs on the Cd, because some are still not my style, but two-thirds of them; The Prayer, Habanera, Carrickfergus and the show tunes I loved. The Flower Duest ain't me, but Charlotte is. I am buying one on-line right now for my Aunt Grace."
4,I only give this 4 stars because,I only give this 4 stars because James was in it i wish it would have been longer it was like a short story
2,I can't believe I paid retail for this...,"Jane has a great job, but is lousy at finances. Up to her ears in debt, she takes a job as a waitress and is humiliated when her chief rival Vanessa's learns her secret and threatens to tell her boyfriend. Since his father is a wealthy politician, she fears that news of this will send her to social Siberia, and decides that two can play that game, and sets about stealing Vanessa's fiance. It's election year and Deans father thinks that he should find a more appropriate mate, but Dean thinks its just a lie, but soon finds himself alone since neither he nor Jane bothers to communicate (and he's a lawyer??).Sound juvenile? It is. And so is the writing. Between the constant designer labels mentioned, Jane's lack of maturity, and her inability to resist an overpriced pair of shoes, the story is just meaningless and trite. Even the love scenes are stale and unimaginative. Just goes to show you can't judge a book by a two sentence blurb."
4,"""HARD!!!""","All I'm gonna say is DO NOT SLEEP ON PISTOL!!! This is hard, but his follow-up, BALLAHOLIC is uncut dope!!!"
5,We LOVE this game!,"I am Mommy to 23 month old twin girls, both with slight speech delays. We got this for Christmas last year, but just took it out a few weeks ago. I am proud to say they can both identify all of the fruits and name them back to me correctly! This has been a great tool fo rme to help them get to talking more. We don't really ""play"" the game yet, but we have learned fruit names and colors, as well as matching, from the cards!The cardboard is a bit flimsy, but then again my girls are a bit young and may just me hard on things. I HIGHLY recommend this! I can't wait until they can play it by the rules - it will be so much fun for our WHOLE family!"
3,Sarah Noble's book review,"Our class read the Courage of Sarah Noble. I liked this story for several reasons. I liked it when Sarah and John went into the wilderness. I also like it when Sarah has her new house. But, I liked it most when Sarah saw Indians! Aaaaaahhh! I learned some interesting facts. I learned that Sarah lived with the Indians. I also learned that they told each other their languages. Plus, they played games. The Courage of Sarah Noble is a good book."
4,The Courage of Sarah Noble,"Our class read The Courage Sarah Noble. I liked this story for several reasons. I liked it when the wolves started to howl. I also liked it when Sarah yelled, ""Indians!"" I really liked it when Sarah met the indians and made friends. I learned some interesting facts. Indians live in wigwams and log houses and that they played a pebble game. The indians taught Sarah how to pick berries. The Courage of Sarah Noble is an interesting book."
1,"One of the Worst Books on ""Indians"" Imaginable","This book is the most ridiculously outdated, laughable children's book on ""Indians"" imaginable. It's got it all: Indians with garbled language, no Indian names, no recognizable Indian nation, ""squaws"" (this is offensive to Native Americans), the ""Indians"" worship Sarah, she ""civilizes"" them by ""teaching"" them, and much, much more! That school systems actually use this book as part of their curriculum (Regrettably, my town actually does, and we even named a school after Sarah) is just plain fatuous, and in the final analysis, shameful. It's the equivalent of ""sambo"" type books which demean African Americans."
1,This is not a good book for children!,This book uses graphic racism against Native American people and should not be read by children. The book causes harm and does not set a good example. It is not classic literature it is classic racism.
4,My review on The Courage of Sarah Noble,I like The Courage of Sarah Noble because it told kids how they can keep up their courage if they ever get scared. One thing I learned is if you don't have a home sometimes people will let you stay with them. One thing I liked is how the author told people what to do if they were in Sarah's shoes.
4,The Reveiw of The courage of Sarah Noble,I decided I liked this book Because it was interesting and it was nonfiction. It also had long words and funny parts. The book had happy parts and I liked it because it was the type of book I like to read. I also liked it because it was a old time book and I like old time books and it took place in 1707. It is really cool and I perfer you like it too!
4,Great book about Pioneers,I like this book because I like pioneers.I would recmmend this book to a friend because it is veryinteresting.
4,A Good Book,The Courage of Sarah Noble is about a girl named Sarah and her father. They go into the woods and have to stay there. I liked the book because it is a good story to learn about - even if some of it isn't really true. My favorite part of the story was when Sarah and her mom and dad are in their new log cabin. Tall John was my favorite character because he kept Sarah safe while her father was gone. I thought the plot and setting of the story were good too. I would reccomend this book for other kids because I think they would like this story. (2)
5,A loving story,I realy liked it alot. It's about a young girl who went with her father to build ahouse in Connecticut for her family: 2 sisters and 2 brothers. It's a story to remember.
1,Courage of Sarah Noble,This story is about a girl named Sarah. I didn't like this book because I would rather be writing than reading. I did not have a favorite part of the book. (6)
1,"Not a ""PC"" Review--Simply Reality!","This book, though well-intentioned, is outdated and offensive. I wish I were being shallow and PC, but I'm not! It has a chapter entitled ""INDIANS!"" Imagine a chapter entitled ""JEWS!""; ""BLACKS!"" ""ASIANS!,"" and one quickly sees that the book is silly and offensive. Instead of children saying to Sarah, ""They [Indians] will eat you,"" imagine the ""Indians"" as African Americans! And subsitute ""Blacks"" or any other so-called ""minority"" for everytime the word ""Indian"" is used in this text.Schools and parents can and should do better--don't buy this book!"
3,The Courage of Sarah Noble,I liked this book because it had a lot of words I did not know and learned them.I would recommend this book to a friend because it is a good book.What is the best part of the story? The best part of the story is when Sarah found her father.Why is it important that Sarah's courage always be with her? She had a family with the Indians.
3,A Review of Sarah Noble,I think it is okay.I thought it was okay because I like Indains. I like to learn about the wilderness.But it was also very exiteing. I thought it was cool because they got mocisons.
5,The Courage of Sarah Noble,I liked this book because it makes me feel safe .I liked this book because it is discriptive. I would recommend this book because my friend will enjoy it.
3,The Courage Of Sarah Noble,I liked this book because it is a short and fun book to read. I would recommend this book to a friend because a little girl was very brave.
5,A girl on a big brave journey,I Like this book becase it has courage and bravery about a girl. I would recommend this book to a friend because if i had a friend that is scared of journey's this book will give him courage to go on journeys. I also like this book because it gave me lots of information about the colonial times.
2,Doesn't quite live up to her other books,"I'm one of ""Carolyne Keene's"" most loyal readers, and I was very dissapointed by her work this time. I literally had to force myself to finish this book. She completely confused you in ways that her books dont normally (and it wasn't a good confusing, it was an annoying confusing) Most of her books are good, so dont let this book stop you from any of her others."
4,"Tigerwalk, Gameday, and beyond . . .","Pate's ""A Tiger's Walk"" is a must-read for Auburn fans, but it also proves enlightening for any football fan. Really, its audience extends even beyond sports fans of any type, as the book tells the story of meeting the challenges that are part of any intense, life-changing experience.To say Pate provides an insider's look into college football is a gross understatement. This book not only takes the reader from the field to the locker room, but then on to the practice field, the training table, and the dorm.Pate speaks frankly about his faith and the role it played in his struggle to find a balance between the demands of SEC football and the highs and lows of everyday life.""A Tiger's Walk"" proves very readable, and Pate always sounds honest and heartfelt. I highly recommend this book."
3,OK book,"This book has decent explanations where my professor was sometimes lacking, but we also did not use all of the chapters of the book as it was an ""Intro to"" kind of class. I only covered the first few chapters and we covered them out of order. My instructor felt the the material should be covered in a different order, and I tend to agree. The order that we covered the topics in the 1st 3 chapters made things much easier to follow.All in all the book had ok explanations, but needs some rearranging of order of topics."
2,Avoid this book if possible,"This book is pretty awful: chapters are tedious, important material is not highlighted, and important material is not discussed. An example is the chapter on ""reduction of order"". They actually do not show the reduction of order, they assume you can do a problem for yourself and ""see it happen"".Examples are mostly irrelevant to the problems in the book. However, the problems are the only part of this book that are decent, and that is why I gave this book 2 stars instead of one.This book seems like it meant for a more rigorous differential equations class, not an introductory one.Avoid"
2,Really bad.. especially for beginers,"I have 4 other Differential Equation textbooks, and they all make this one look straight awful.The best way to sum up this textbook is this example, you know when you are trying to explain something to someone, but you do not know what exactly you are talking about either so you use big words to try and sound smart and hope the other person will just give up on trying to understand? Well that is what this textbook does for about 600 pages..."
3,Not All Bad,"Gaitskills collection of short stories, ""Because They Wanted to"", gives the reader a slice of real life. I enjoy being thrown into the middle of realistic, uncomfortable situations. However, the infrequent use of profanity does not add anything to the book. In fact, the vulgar language distracts the reader and makes the reader pull back from the story and question where the author is going. Her stories also lack action. I find myself dozing off. I would like to see the stories a little shorter and more exciting."
2,Not a rival to Bad Behavior,"I thought I'd try this one after reading Bad Behavior and another short story of the author's in The New Yorker's love story anthology, and I was sadly disappointed. The stories here did not seem very real to me, the third person style in most of them was unexciting. I liked Turgor best. I thought the last paragraph in the title story was unnecessary. I am at a loss trying to rationalize the type of movie they decided to see in The Dentist, and why they didn't end up in bed after viewing it."
5,Great Movie,"I loved this movie, and couldn't wait to watch MVP2. I love how smart and entertaining these chimps are. After watching MVP2 I started searching for another to watch and found out MXP is out!!!! Going to order immediately so I can keep watching."
1,Just doesen't work,"Seems everything I plug into this hub does not have enough power to operate or charge, even my ipod Nano. I've tried with both the red and black plugs connected and just the black. Seems to be well made, but unfortunately useless to me. Maybe it would work better if they didn't include the useless ""light up"" feature? Who needs a hub to draw power for a light!"
4,the book,"this book was well written for a historical book, but unless you have to read it for a history class i wouldn't reccommend it to anyone."
2,For ages 19 and above,"Well... being a seventeen-year-old and not real big on reading, I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone who has seen ""Dumb and Dumber"" more than once and believes that it deserves every award that it qualifies for--like I do. This book is more for those who are in or past college and have decided that they want to ""experience"" American history in a more in-depth perspective (to those my age: I'm not implying VR). It is, however, well written. Daniel Boorstin did a great job and kudos to him. He definitely deserved the accolade which came in the form of the Bancroft Prize--but I still don't like it. Nevertheless, I finished the book--eventhough I have chronic thoughts about burning it--but only because it was a mandatory assignment and required an essay. If you have enough courage and are willing to purchase this book, you better have a lot of patience (and make sure to hide the matches)."
5,Change your way of thinking and you change YOU,"After reading this book, I found out what type of thinker I was and a way to change the way that I think. This is a great book for those that are trying to change careers later in life. If you want to grow successful think on a large scale, and continue to hold it. Great book even for TODAY'S teenagers."
5,Over 50 Years of Results Speak for Themselves!,"This book is a must-read for anybody who wants to be more successful! It doesn't matter if your idea of success involves money, fame, power, influence, status, or any combination of these things.Read the book, pay attention, and apply what you learn. Do these three things and you'll be closer to success (as you define it)."
2,Repetitive Motivational Drivel,"If you need advice on how to go from being a self-hating loser to achieving moderate success, then read this book. If, on the other hand, you already have confidence and self respect in your corner, this book has nothing more to offer you. The entire thesis of this book (the power of positive thinking) could have been summarized in a single paragraph."
2,rather boring read,"I've read/listened to numerous similar books, but I only got a few pages into this book before i lost interest. although there were a lot of examples(which can be good sometimes), the book was very repetitive and had too many examples. the book would have been better if the author had cut out a lot of the fluff and just given his tips for improvement."
3,Thinking Big book,"The book was in good condition. The problem was that the print was smaller and there were less pages in the book dur to smaller print. I did not like that. I already own the book (pictured to the right) and when this version arrived, I did not care for it. I ordered this copy for my son, and I did not really want the print to be smaller."
5,Thinking Big makes you Be Big,"""The Magic of Thinking Big"" is one of the best books I've read yet. I've read everything that Anthony Robbins has written and among other authors such as Dale Carnegie I have yet to see it put into such a simple context. This book is worth it's price 5 times over and I Know that anyone who reads it will get as much from it as I have."
5,A true motivation booster,"Have you been giving excuses for all your failures? Do you consider yourself as a pygmy? Do you always find faults with others? Are you dreaming about success and not taking any actions? If you have answered ""yes"" to any of these questions, this book is really for YOU.I enjoyed reading this book. David Schwartz corroborates his thoughts and suggestions with wonderful stories. You can apply his practical ideas even to change some of your perpetual habits. This book is really a motivation booster and forces you to get into action. It stimulates your positive thinking/attitude and alleges you not to make negative impressions about people/ideas/beliefs. The book affirms that successful people constantly involve in self-development.I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to be successful and is looking for a motivation booster."
5,They Fought Like Warrior Poets,"Braveheart is nothing short of a masterpiece of film making. Gibson directs this beautiful piece in which he stars as Scottish hero William Wallace - a man who's quest for revenge turns into a fight for freedom from tyrannical British rule. Winner of five Academy Awards including Best Picture, and also featuring a stellar supporting cast and a magnificent score by James Horner, Braveheart is a classic that belongs on any movie-goer's shelf"
3,Not Gibson's best movie by far!,"The Battle scenes are well staged. The plot is a great achievement but overall, this is still a somewhat a disapointment from the director of The Passion of the Christ."
5,"My name Sergey, I am from Sent-Petersburg, Russia :-)","Sophie Marseau best women... Sorru, I can`t write in English, only Russian :-( I am 23 years old. My E-mail: academy@estate.spb.ru or bomjik@chat.ru èüì èüíé, ñ òòè äàò, ìàññè òñàùè. À ò, äèí óññèé òóò? Íó àäí, ò óññè íèìàò èñüìè àìüò..."
1,Extreme Violence,"Buyer beware: if you do not equate ""entertainment"" with graphic violence, you will not enjoy this movie. Guard your eyes, for they are the window of your heart."
5,MEL's greatest performance,"This movie is simply awesome. Can't imagine how Mel was able to direct and star in this epic of a film, and maintain it, in all it's glory.I was lucky enough to see the dvd all ready. The sound is sensational, not to mention the insightful commentary by Gibson.Without a doubt this is a must, for all movie lovers.*****"
5,FREEEEEDOM!!!!,Classic. Mel Gibson's top performance in my opinion. I've seen this movie numerous times and owned it on VHS. I had to buy the DVD to have as a collectable. One of my top 5 favorites of all time.
5,COLLECTOR'S ITEM: DEFIES TIME...AGELESS!,"This movie captures all the theme I expect in a movie...has context, it has meat! It's rare nowadays to have a production that would cater to the likings of everyone; love, romance, action, deception, betrayal, compassion, true friendship, etc...BRAVEHEART has it all. Especially, this movie highlights the true virtue of ""DETERMINATION,"" as well as, PATRIOTISM! Yet, with all its heart-pounding, exhilarating, action filled scenes...Mel Gibson managed to introduce comedy within this movie...spectacular!"
5,Superb movie about courage and freedom,"Mel Gibson gives an excellent performance, and the ending to this movie will suprise you. Won a Best Picture, and Best Director Oscar. (Mel Gibson also directed this movie) In my opinion, it is one of the greatest movies ever. A classic."
1,Utter Garbage,"I don't usually write reviews, but I couldn't let this pass. I knew going in it would be a dissappointment, but the story of Scotland's wars for independence is so important to European and American history that I figured I had to watch it. Setting aside the historical innaccuracies, the assassination of Wallace's character is worse the barbaric execution that Edward I put him through. History reports Wallace as a knight, a brilliant tactician, and more importantly, a gentleman. Nothing like Gibson's adulterous schizophrenic savage. The story of Wallace would be extremely compelling without embellishment. To substitute this garbage is a crime against history and the civilized world."
4,Sir William Wallace lives on...,"Although the film is historically inaccurate, it portrayed the main events of Sir Willam Wallace's struggle against King Edward I, Longshanks, i.e, the Battle of Stirling Bridge and the Battle of FalKirk, as well as his execution. Mel Gibson did well in his portrayal of Wallace (he presented a believable image of a Sottish warrior).Also, the battle scenes are graphic - which add to the impact of the film. It does NOT glorify war and shows that humans shed blood and die. If this was not the first movie to do so, then it was ceratinly one of the first. Since then, realistic battle scenes (e.g. in Saving Private Rayn and Black Hawk Down) have been created.The film is never boring, even when Wallace is not fighting. The political intrigue and romance in this film are adequate (and well developed for an action film). Well done Mel."
5,Braveheart: A timless classic,"Many a movie has wowed me. But, the one that impacted me the most is Braveheart. It combines great actors with action, romance and enough storyline to keep you watching until the end. We probably know most of the storyline. Scottish Rebel William Wallace leads a band of Scotsmen to freedom from England. Him being one of my ancestors, I was piqued by my curiousity and watched it. I instantly knew it would be a good movie. Special Note, the images are awesome and are stunning, with great characters. Buying it will be a great purchase and you won't regret it."
5,History is Written by the Victors,"Yes, it is horribly inaccurate, but that doesn't matter to most of us. If I want a historical depiction of actual events I'll watch a documentary.This movie has something for everyone; fighting, action, comedy, gore (too much for some), revenge, and an absolutely great love story. Not sure why I'm writing a review, seeing how everyone has seen it already, but here we are."
3,BRAVEHEART OR HOW TO SHOT OVERSTIMATED TRASHES,"I have nothing against Mel Gibson and nothing against historical movies (because I love them!), but I was rather disappointed by this pseudohistorical spectacle that is closer to such classical trashes like Cleopatra or Spartacus than to the very best examples of the genre like The War Lord, Ben Hur (without last 30 minutes) etc. Gibson's ""modification"" of history is sometimes awful, but, on the other hand, I must appreciate his direction of the action battle scenes and good scenery. I understand that many people like this movie, but this really isn't the best example of the genre. This is rather a fairy-tale about love of a heroic Scottish prince and a beautiful English princess and if they didn't die, they lived eternally... Sorry."
3,9 Short Stories by Ernest Haycox,"I'm not sure how the review for a Lisa Scottoline novel got to this page but it is misplaced, I only gave this book 3 stars because I am not a fan of short stories though these are better than most, story titles are Toll Bridge, Lonesome Ride, The Inscrutable Man, Water Hole, Wild Jack Rhett, Mrs Benson, Episode-1880, Deadline and Night on Don Jamie Street.."
2,not up to standards,"I've read all of Dianne Dorrans Saeks books and own many of them. I eagerly await each new addition so I was very dissapointed in California Interiors.It appears to be written and photographed for a European market. It's all stuff we've seen over and over again with no cohesive theme. The graphics aren't up to her usual standards, the book doesn't seem to have any design. It looks as though it's a first time effort."
3,Cohesive covers album,"Bowie's tribute to the sixties contains familiar and obscure covers from The Kinks, The Merseys, Yardbirds and Pink Floyd among others. The band is tight, the selection is interesting, but the sound is very samey throughout. More variety in instrumentation and arrangement would have lifted this album above the ordinary. The overall style is not dissimilar from his cover on Let's Spend The Night Together on the Aladdin Sane album. Having said that, I still find it enjoyable to listen to and definitely more rewarding than his Let's Dance album. My favorites include Here Comes The Night, Friday On My Mind and of course, the beautiful Sorrow, which deservedly was a great hit. This new CD edition includes his version of the Brel song Port Of Amsterdam which is interesting at least."
5,Great for horse loving girl,Bought this game for my 10 year old daughter who loves horses and she loves this game.I would recommend this game. Its nice that you can still find games for the game boy.
2,old-fashioned & outdated,"We think, it's quiet an old -fashioned message, that the autors gives to us. I think it's stupid, to tell us, that only the speech is important to be somebody. We also didn't like to read a play alone. It would have been much more interesting and funny to read it in class, everybody is a certain person. G.B.Shaw seems to know very much about the way of life in every class. He shows the differences in a pretty funny way, and we could get a good idea about those persons. The film is really too long. We didn't like the songs very much, perhaps they are important for understanding, but we think it was not always necessary. We think, today the world is much more complicated, it's not enough to have a good pronunciation to get a good job. And there are too few Higgins-like people in the world. I think, today, nobody would teach a guttergirl for so little money."
4,PYGMALION WAS JUST GREAT!,"We read Pygmalion in class and we were very fascinated by the way, G..B. Shaw criticises the British system. He does it in a very funny and humorous way. We liked especially Elisa, the lovely flower girl . She proves, that even a common flower girl can become a ""princess"". We liked also Higgins and his habits , his curses and we wished just for the end that Higgins would marry Elisa."
4,Compare vs My Fair Lady,"I bought this because we had watched My Fair Lady and I wanted to see how different it was. The answer is ""not very"".The songs of course, and many of the scenes they were in, were added, but the main dialog was straight from the original.The biggest difference, and one that I assume most of the fans of the musical wouldn't like, is the ""sequel"" written by Shaw that describes the characters' lives after the end of the play. I know my wife will be disappointed if she ever reads it.As for the edition: I noticed no problems with it and it's hard to argue with the price."
1,"Wonderful play, but this version...","I know many will look at my low rating and think, ""What!"" However, the rating is not based on the play, which is wonderful, but this version of the play. Many will be attracted to this version because of the price, but there is a reason why this book is so cheap. There are several humorous or key scenes missing from the Dover Thrift version. Just to name a few: the bath scene, the whole ball/party scene with Nepommuck and Freddy's proposal.If you're looking for just a taste of the play or if a reader has low/limited attention span, than this might be the version for you. But if you are looking to read the play as it was written, to enjoy the humor and satire of Shaw, than I suggest a different version--perhaps the Penguin Classics edition."
5,Flavorful basting spray for grill lovers,"While dating my husband he grilled up some of the best brats I ever had. He refused to tell me what he used telling me it was his secret ingredient. It took me getting married to him to finally find out his secret ingredient was the Original Bry basting spray. Finding out about Bry spray was definately worth getting married! We use it mostly whenever we grill pork , chicken & brats. We even used it on the Thanksgiving turkey we grilled for our large family gathering. It was so good there was nothing left but bones."
1,"If there were only a choice for ""No Stars""...","I have to agree wholeheartedly... This book was a complete a waste of time and money. Repeated misspellings of words that my ten year-old can spell, information on Ghost Hunting that can be found anywhere else, and a bevy of fantastical and religious nonsense abound. Vampires, ""witches"" (we won't even go into the gross distortion and perpetuating stereotypes here), demons, devils... wasn't this supposed to be a ""scientific"" book about Ghost Hunting?!? I can't help but wonder if all those ""rave"" reviews are personal friends of Mr. Brandon... Not worth it!"
3,A bit dissapointing...,"I was told this album was one of Bowie's best...so being a huge fan after hearing Hunky Dory and Heroes, I bought it. The album starts out great. I absolutely adore the first few songs as well as number 7 (sorry, can't remember the name). But I just don't understand the last 4 songs...it would be good if there was just one of them but to end it with a stream of somewhat boring songs just didn't work for me. But don't let this stop you from buying it. This album does have some great songs on it. I just suggest you buy Hunky Dory before this one."
4,Two sides to the synth!,"This marvelous album consists of short, melodic songs like Speed Of Life, Breaking Glass, What In The World, Sound & Vision and long, dark pieces like Warszawa, Art Decade, Weeping Wall and Subterraneans. My favorites include the catchy Sound & Vision with its poetic lyrics and brilliant guitar hook and of course the atmospheric Breaking Glass which inspired Nick Lowe's ""I Love The Sound Of Breaking Glass"" on his Pure Pop For Now People album. The short pop pieces are strangely addictive in their robotic minimalism, while the long instrumentals are quite evocative but they would probably appeal more to lovers of classical music than your average Bowie fan. (Those who like Gorecki's ""Three Sorrowful Songs"" would love them). On Low, Bowie took synth music in two very different directions. This was a groundbreaking album for its time and remains a remarkable listening experience although I definitely prefer the first part."
2,I don't like it,"I've tried to like it, but I just found some good but unfinished ideas. A new career in a new town is the best song. The other tracks can hardly be called ""songs"". The second part is just boring. Maybe it's my limit, but I think the love around this album is more nostalgia for many fans, and its importance in music history is just its experimental approach and sound which anticipate the eighties, not so much for the ""songs"" themselves."
4,Waugh bemoans the Fall of Rome,"As an orthodox Catholic convert with a fondness for high quality British fiction, I had to have this book of Evelyn Waugh's gripes and barks at poor Cardinal Heenan concerning the end of the Latin Liturgy following Vatican II. As you would expect, Waugh comes off as witty, sardonic, and somewhat tenderly brokenhearted. It is rare to see Waugh in this mode, but you can tell he felt the changes in the Mass on a personal level. Modernity drove Waugh to drink & bouts of fantastic & biting satire, but in these letters he comes across like a very intelligent child who has lost it's mother. Heenan is the villain of the piece, though no fault of Waugh: the Cardinal's letters show him to be a smooth liar firmly bent on pursuing the Gospel of Trendiness with little regard for the feelings of his flock. All in all, a poignant chronicle of one man's dealings with a Bishop-as-Bureaucrat."
4,shakatak's best lp in cd format,"I got this vinyl in the 80s when it first released. This is one of their first commerical succcess album. Filled with cool blend of jazz and easy listening, this unique sound paved road for the booming of jazz blend groups in the mid 80s such as Sade. Though shakatak manage to survive and still have new cuts occasionally, I still think this their best, with tracks like ""invitation"" (top 10 hits) and really cool bass on ""lose myself"" and ""usual situation"" even though these tracks never released as single. Thanks to the Japanese label re-released this album in cd format and its a good chance to catch the group's best performance in translucent cd sound."
1,Rusted!,This is one of those items that looks much better on picture than it is. I received an almost rusted pendant that was impossible to open (as they are advertizing). Don't waste your money!!
5,This book was a great mystery that everyone should read.,"Let Me Call You SweetheartI felt that this was a very good novel. Mary Higgins Clark pulls you right into the book. She has you guessing a new person until the end. This is a mystery book, that I feel everyone who enjoys mysterious or thrilling books should read. This book has to do with a prominent lawyer who takes her daughter to a plastic surgeon (because of an accident) and ends up with a strange case a her hands. Kerry McGrath, the main character is connected to this odd and twisted mystery from 10 years prior. Little does she know, but she has more in common with this murder than meets the eye. I think that this book could be one of the best books that I ever read, I would definitely recommend this to another person."
1,Fine,"I think it's a fine book kind og confusing. If you never read MHC books before you should read it, but if you did than this one is the same as her other books, same plot. After reading three books of hers it kind of got anoying."
5,"Gripping, a great thriller!","I recently read this, and I could not put it down! It was extremely gripping and very exciting. As a resident the area of Bergen County where the book takes place, it was also a lot of fun to read about my home. It's kind of exciting to think that people in California are reading about your area!The plot centers around Kerry McGrath, whose daughter, Robin, must go to plastic surgeon Charles Smith after a car accident. This leads to Kerry's reopening of a ten-year-old murder case. Her investigation is helped by a man named Geoff Dorso, the lawyer of the convicted in that case. It's a truly thrilling read.With elements of suspense, romance and humor, this book is perfect for any fan of mysteries! Or just any Bergen County resident. :0)"
4,Makes me want to read more,"This was the first Mary Higgins Clark book I've read. I've had it laying around the house forever and just never seemed in the mood. Then, today, I ran out of anything else to read and picked it up. I couldn't put it down and read it in about 3 hours. Ms. Clark kept me interested in the plot twists the entire time. I couldn't wait to see what happened. It makes me want to read some of her other books."
2,my last by this author,"I loved the first couple of novels by Higgins Clark, but her style has grown stale and shallow. I found myself laughing out loud in disbelief with this one. The characters are sketchy and cardboard. The dialogue is so mundane and artificial I found myself wondering why she bothered with it. Clark's strengths are in her plot lines and her pacing. But with boring dialogue and shallow characterization, I just don't find myself caring about the characters by the end of the story. This will be the last one I bother reading."
2,"Monotonous, Implausible, Convoluted and Confusing","Let Me Call You Sweetheart, by Mary Higgins Clark, read by Bess Armstrong. A convoluted and seemingly implausible tale. Not MHC's best by a long shot, but may have lost a lot in the abridgement, which is pretty awful. Too many characters (and too many of them lawyers!) and the setting jumps between New York or New Jersey -- never quite sure. Finally, Bess Armstrong has a smooth, lovely voice, and excellent pronunciation. But it's kinda like listening to the voice mail lady read you a story, hard to catch the differences in characters, and somehow beautifully read and monotonous too? THE LOTTERY WINNER (read by Edith Bunker!) was a joy to listen to; and The Anastasia Syndrome was a delightfully neat collection - but take a pass on this one."
3,Not upto MHC standards,"It was an interesting read, but didn't seem like a plausible story. It took a while to get used to so many different characters. But I was most disappointmented by the end. I felt there were still several lose ends to be tied. For instance, who actually operated on Suzanne? Why did Grace feel that she had seen Jason Arnott?"
2,Lukewarm,"Well, rats . . . this book had so much potential. The idea was great and there were good characters: an old murder that resulted in an innocent man being put in jail, a freaky plastic surgeon ""re-creating"" women's faces to look just like the daughter he had been grieving over, an aspiring politician facing consequences of a renewed investigation and of course, there's an assortment of slimy criminals and all kinds of secrets that unfold throughout. The middle of the book is about where it's at it's best, but it just seemed sloppy and rushed at times, especially the ending. If you're looking for a fast-paced whodonnit and a quick read, you'll probably do fine with this. If you would like a little more depth and suspense, though, Mary Higgins Clark's ""Moonlight Becomes You"" is great or as another reviewer suggested, pick up any classic by Agatha Christie."
3,same video as the non-holiday puppy party,"this is hands-down my toddler's favorite thing to watch. when i saw that there was a holiday version, i scooped it up and set it aside for christmas. after i received it, i realized that they just had ""holiday packaging"" for the dvd, and it's the same exact movie as the original puppy party, with santa hats and gifts super-imposed on the original cover. it's okay because i can use an extra copy i guess, but i wanted to put this out there in case anyone else is wondering if it's different."
3,Why the hype? They're no replacement for Crayola.,"I got these crayons after reading everyone's gushing reviews about them. Yes, they're triangluar. However, there's like five different shades of brown in there, and only two shades of blue. There's just one true red. We bought these to use in the car--not a good idea. It's hard sometmes to open the lid (it flips up like a steno notebook) and he can't do it on his own. He's 4. When he does manage to open it, the crayons come flying out because they don't sit very deep in the tray. He asks for colors he's used to with Crayola (gold, for one example) and I have to give him yellow or this gross yellow-brown color. I just don't see why people are so crazy about these things. Maybe the jumbo set for toddlers would be better, but it's no substitute for a big, giant box of Crayola.He's also used them once and the tips are nearly colored off, I don't see any difference in how long they last. They wear the same."
4,Good crayons,"I've never really used any crayons other then Crayola brand crayons, I purchased a bunch of Melissa and Doug items for my daughter and loved them all, so I purchased these along with the Melissa and Doug coloring pad. The crayons are great, easy to grasp and come in a sturdy plastic case, which is great. The pigment on the crayons vary, but it gets the job done, no complaints here."
4,Pretty for a right hand cocktail ring,"Very pretty and sparkly, but obviously not real. The center CZ stone is very large, and does not look like a diamond. So far, so good, I've had it a month, and have not lost any stones or seen any signs of it falling apart. It's great for a temporary ring or for occaional wear as a cocktail ring with some bling! I love the filigree setting, it's very vintage-looking, and the sterling silver also gives it an antique appearance. It's true to size, it has a very thin band, and is comfortable. Overall, great ring!"
1,BIG BUST,This dvd was a BIG BUST. The rating on it was rated X but there was nothing rated X about this movie. Nothing but strip teases. I've seen more adult actions on cable tv. This was nothing but a big disappointment. Would not recommend this to anyone. pretty much false advertisement by putting a X rating.
3,The Conquest of Happiness,"This book, written in 1930, is a self-help book written by a philosopher. The book is split in two sections. Causes of Unhappiness has chapters like: ?Envy,? ?The Sense of Sin,? and ?Fear of Public Opinion.? The Causes of Happiness are ?Zest,? ?Affection,? ?Work,? and ?The Family.? Each chapter explains how to be happy in some different way. This book was written well, and Russell had his information right. But the book is close to being outdated, and I personally have no use for it. I give The Conquest of Happiness two and a half stars out of five."
2,DeWalt DW567KK not living up to expectations,"I purchased this tool last March using it ocassionally. On one ocassion I chipped mortar off some cinder block so I could frame a door opening. Then I used it to drill 5/16"" x 2"" deep holes in brick to install shutters. The other day I used it to hammer-drill 15, 1/2"" holes in concrete to assist with cutting out a slot in 8"" concrete to allow underground power to go up a wall to the main panel on a new house. I used it for about 45 minutes, with a few breaks for me to rest. Then I pulled out the chisel for this tool and used the hammer selection along with a sledge hammer to bust out the concrete. It did great until I started smelling something burning. The black oil started showing up in the chuck on the drill bits. Now it is off to DeWalt for repair. Should last longer than this. Dissappointing."
2,poor Milton,"Interest in Milton has waned in American universities, and I can't help but think that THE RIVERSIDE MILTON tossed him into an eternity more boring than anything his prose could have ever created.I understand that this text is ""academic"" so its asinine price and density are justified. Yet Flannagan has taken scholasticism to the extreme, sacrificing all for footnotes in a mad zeal to, like the old Welsh poets, show off his research. Thus this book's perfect audience comprises graduate pedants lost in footnote fogs, loving every minute of brilliant insights like, ""This comma was omitted in the 1676 Edition."" A high disappointment, especially since THE RIVERSIDE CHAUCER is very, very strong. But still, THE RIVERSIDE MILTON'S not a total waste (the introductions are well written and often insightful).Other reviewers have already identified the problems with so many footnotes, so I won't rehash. I'll just add my frown amongst many others and continue reading Milton elsewhere."
2,Didn't care for the taste,"I think that the vanilla flavor in this makes it taste awful. I wish I had bought the unflavored. I mix it with mixed berries, a banana, and juice and I can hardly drink it. I'd been buying Pea Protein before this, and compared to this the pea tastes amazing :)"
2,Out of tune,"Painfully out of tune performance - especially the lead violin. Now he's sharp, then he's flat. When the other members hijack the melody, they too are offenders. Beyond that, there are many incidents of scrape scrape scrape. You just want the thing to stop. I would say buy this as a gateway drug to these wonderful pieces then go out and buy a great version - however, just enduring these performances has killed my desire to hear these works again, and given me the image of Mozart dressed up in a red spandex devil costume and laugh laugh laughing at me. Don't let this happen to you."
1,Unmemorable...skip this one,"As a true Arkenstone fan and owner of every one of his recordings, I found this CD to be entirely forgetable. Entirely missing are the engaging orchestrations and adventurous spirit of Arkenstone's other recordings. As background atmosphere for a TV special, I guess that the music is suitable, but for everyday listening this one is entire unmemorable. Save your money."
1,Amazon's The Rise and Fall of the Knights Templar: book myth.,"I have tried over a period of 4 months to order this book, and each time the order has been delayed several times. I wouldn't suggest ordering it through this system, unless you have a lot of time to wait for its arrival."
1,not worth it,I thumbed through this at a book store and it is not worth 40 bucks. all the info in this book can be found on youtube and google for free.
4,Prettu good,"A lot of people seemed to have complained that the case smelled really bad when they received it. My case didn't smell bad at all.The case is very practical though. It fits the console in really nicely and you can fit in everything else into the different compartments EXCEPT the power adapter. It seems like they measure it on how big the adapter is but failed to calculate in that the sides where the cable is makes it about half an inch longer that you cant bend. This means it does not fit into the case as well as it should in my opinion.The case itself seems sturdy and i feel safe having my wii in it, but you can tell it was only $30, by that it looks pretty cheap when you take a closer look at it.Overall this product is good and I would recommend it for others!!"
2,It's alright,"Decent. Fits quite a bit: four games, two controllers + nuncucks, power supply, RCA, and motion sensor bar, not the base. Everything is pretty cramped inside... More then I really like. They should have made it a little bigger. Looks good."
4,"Solid case, great for Wii travel.","The Wii Pro Gamer's Case is very good. Solid case, sturdy contruction, and keeps the parts from moving around, with set compartments. I bought this case, because I take my Wii to work, to have fun during lunch times, and take a break from all the sitting, since I work in an office.The Wii Pro Gamer's Case holds the pieces well, and keeps them safe. Since Nintendo has the extra thick covers on the controllers, they don't fit in the spot for them in this case. However, there is room on top of the Wii, under the velcro strap.I typically travel with the Wii, 2 controllers, Nunchuck, Wireless sensor bar, video cable, A/C power adapter, and a couple of extra video titles. All of this fits very well in this case.So if you need to carry your system around, this is a good case."
5,Awesome Case...Durable and cool looking....,This case is an excellent buy if you own a wii and need a carrying case. I feel more comfortable carrying this around than a backpack. I recommend this case to everyone!!
5,All Genius is Ten Years Too Soon,"Beaster receives what it projects; dazed, feedback- hangover reviews...It will, however, become a classic; an ""underground"" classic. If you like Bob's angry, macho, brooding,inverted romantisicm, nothing compares. Makes NIN seem like Yani."
4,Fine Waldron quintet at the Vanguard,"Waldron, Charley Rouse, Woody Shaw. Reggie Workman, and Ed Blackwell play extended versions of three Waldron tunes, plus the pianist is seen playing a solo version of his classic ""Left Alone"" at another venue. The performances, video and audio are all excellent. However, the production gets a little too artsy during many of the solos, occasionally shifting to still shots or even slow motion, which tends to be distracting and frustrating. A minor quibble--recommended otherwise."
4,Wireless for older laptop.,"Worked fine right out of the box, easy install of plug in from cd, couldn't have been simpler. Have great signal from Buffalo Notebook adapter working with diffrent brand of receiver for broadband (ZyXel) . Shipping from manufacture location on time. good performance with my older toshiba satellite. Recommend for those without built in wireless G laptop equipment."
3,Some details about this recording,"I was one of the artists on this CD. It was recorded at DV studios in Shorewood, Wisconsin. Here are some of the players:Kostia (his piano and synth playing can be heard on the Narada label)Brett Lipshutz: Flute, WhistlesChris Buckley: Fiddle, violaEd Paloucek: FiddleDan Beimborn: bouzouki, mandolinAt the time the 4 of us were in a Milwaukee band called ""180 & the Letter G"". Alas, we never recorded our own CD, though if you mentally subtract the chirping crickets and nature sounds from the mix, the tune sets are more or less as we played them in the Milwaukee Irish pub scene in the mid to late 90s!This was one of those CDs that was on the kiosks where you could press a button of the CD cover to hear a sound sample. Friend reported seeing it all over the country, so I suppose it must have done well!"
5,SOLID REFERENCE BOOK,"Outstanding..for techniques and information source. Recipe side is weak due to inconsistent ingredient measurement format (ounces, grams, etc....within same recipes). The reader must know conversion rules to succeed with recipes."
2,Not recommended,"I confess that having bought this recording, I listened once and immediately took it to my local used CD store and sold it. Having only given it the one listen, I can't offer detailed reviews of the individual performances as I'd like, only an overall impression. I found the vocal ensemble undistinguished, the orchestral sound and conducting unremarkable at best. ""Matrimonio"" is a piece I know well; the score has tremendous charm and many beautiful and witty moments throughout. It does need a very strong ensemble equipped with pretty voices and solid technique, strong personalities, and theatrical flair. It doesn't survive a mediocre recorded performance well. I'm hopeful of finding a better version. (I haven't heard the Barenboim in decades, but I remember its being very well sung. The old EMI/Scala performance was lots of fun, but the opera is very heavily cut, and Stignani is just too old for Fidalma.)"
4,"A GREAT RE-WORK BY RHINO, BUT...","I will defer to all the laudatory comments listed here. I had one observation, however, regarding this new version by Rhino vs. the previous, also-excellent version by Rykodisc.The final track on the Ryko CD was ""A Town Called Big Nothing (Really Big Nothing)"", a wonderful, 5-minute+ little gem originally writen for a Alex Cox film that featured Costello's father on trumpet.However, it is NOT included on the new Rhino CD. This is a curious and unfortunate omission, so FYI to all who are considering replacing the Ryko's. Perhaps Rhino will include it on one of the future Costello releases.(UPDATE: The track never made it to any of the Rhino releases. It now only appears on The Singles Volume 3 set.)"
5,"One of his best, this has long been my favorite Elvis album","My favorite Elvis albums are: My Aim is True, This Year's Model, Armed Forces, Get Happy, King of America, Brutal Youth, All This Useless Beauty, and Blood and Chocolate. But Blood and Chocolate is my favorite. Nick Lowe was such a perfect producer for Elvis, and the band are at their best here. Everyone talks about ""I Want You"". It's so un-ignorable, such a bloodletting. But I Hope Your Happy Now, Blue Chair, Crimes of Paris & Next Time Round are all pop masterpieces as only Elvis can pen them and deliver them. This album is well-written, well-recorded, well-paced, well-sequenced. If you don't have this one, get it. If you do have it, give it another listen. It's just so good."
4,Spiritual Birthline,"Quite an interesting approach to all the ways that the Lord has been working in our lives and the author uses the example of our spiritual birth being like our physical birth. It was an insightful book and I would recommend it, it's an easy read also."
