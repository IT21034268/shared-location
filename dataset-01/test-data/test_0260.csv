3,Cornwall,It is ok. What information I can find on Cornwall in other sources is not much. This book added a lot about what was going on there in times past. It is weak on family names and lines but so are the archives in England for the period from the 1800's back to the 1600's. There is nothing about the original peoples who populated the area.I must say that what the book does cover is very great and it will remain part of my library.
1,Puppy too smart!,"Unfortunately, this pet pen only served it's purpose for two days. On day three, our 4 month old Maltipoo discovered how to place her paws in the grate openings and crawl over the top, letting herself out. It only somewhat serves it's purpose if you are in the same room and continually tell to the pup to stay put. May have to give it away (the pen, not the puppy)."
3,Indoor/Outdoor Fence,"The product is okay. The door is a little smaller then I expected, it is not as stable as it will slide on the floor or carpet, but it contains my dog, which is the whole point. The height is okay and the width is good. Would recommend for a medium size dog."
2,BAD,"I did not receive any papers for this merchandise. Neither paper for to return the merchandise. Also, the tools for the little door to be installed never came, in spite of I sent an e-meil requesting it. Until now 03-19-2011, I have not received any answer at all. I cannot use it. I am very upset. I hope you can help me now to avoid the feedback w/ video."
2,Iris puppy pen,"It only took one day for my 8 week old fox terrier puppy to figure out how to climb out of this pen. Not a good product for an active puppy, even a small breed. The openings are like little ladder rungs, very easy to climb up."
5,Great!,I keep my pup crated while I'm away from home but this gives him space and keeps him out of trouble while I'm cooking or doing something else that's doesn't let me keep watch over him. It's sturdy and a good size for a small dog.
5,our pet apartment,"We call this our pet apartment. We have two miniature dachshunds who stay inside our home all day while we are away at work. They love their apartment. It is big enough inside for them to have their bed, food, water, potty pads, and play area. One of the great things about this particular one is that you can reshape it so that it can take on just about any shape...even go around corners like we have it doing now in our home. We even went out of town and packed it down so that we could take it with us. (It is so easy to take apart and put up!)The sides are tall enough so that our babies can not begin to jump over it. It is sturdy enough that they jump onto the sides and lean on it with no wavering of the structure...when it is all connected.It does not mar the floor. What a plus!!! I don't know how we ever got along without this!!!"
3,My 4 month old Yorkie can climb out of it already!,"I bought this product for my yorkie puppy that is now 4 months old and weighs around 3 pounds. Within a week, she was climbing out of it. That is the reason I only gave the product 3 stars. The product is very well made and folds up easily for portability. It's small enough that you can stick it in a corner or anywhere. The door is well made, though I rarely used it. The pen is easily cleaned. I wish it had some kind of bottom, though. I improvised by putting down a blanket and some training pads. I think this would be an excellent product for breeders to use for young litters of puppies. For those people who are using this product for adult animals, how in the world do you keep your dogs in it?"
3,"Iris CI-604 Indoor/Outdoor Plastic Pet Pen, 4 Panels","We bought 2 pet pens and put them together for more room for our 1 year old red nosed pit bull. The product is very easy to put together and pretty sturdy. The only issue we have is that it is too low and our dog quickly learned to jump out. We solve this problem by purchasing shade screen from Home Depot for $27 along with some grommets and ties and secured the shade screen over the top of the pen. Without the shade screen the pen would have been relatively useless for our pet, but could have used it for our grandkids!"
4,Contain your excitement,My wife and I recently brought a puppy into our family and this has been perfect. It allows for easy access and portability. It's very easy to bring it close to you so your pup never misses you.
3,Too short,"I like the pen, very easy to set up. However it's too short. I have a Morkie and she is able to jump right out of it when she wants to."
4,"Ok, But only for very small dogs","I have a 3 lbs yorkiepoo she is only 4 months old. We bought this for travel when we go to visit family for the day. The size is small but it's ok, for a short period of time. I think it's very nicely made and I love the little doggie door, however the think it too short. My baby is a jumper and when she jumps her heads goes over the gate YIKES!! I defiantly wouldn’t feel comfortable leaving her unsupervised (leaving the house) It’s great for now but I think it a few months she will be able to jump out.The kids lean in to pet her she get so excited she starts jumping like crazy and NOW she’s figured out her paws fit inside the gate wholes so she’s attempted to climb the gate….. She a very clever lil girl. We kept the box it comes in and we need to put it on top to prevent her from trying to jump out."
5,Great for Rabbits :)!,This is working great for my Rabbit Sky :D. There is enough space and my 7 year old fits in there with him to play. He has not been able to jump out but he is a baby bunny so not sure when he gets older. But for know it is a perfect home for him. It is better than a cage because i think having a rabbit in a cage is kinda cruel since they don't have enough room. Here are some pics of my bunny and his play pen :).
5,My Dog loves it!,My Dog Chili loves this so much than her regular kennel. It is easy to set up; even my 6 year old can do it* (*and did) We had it ready to go in 5 min or less. My dog usually sleeps in a covered kennel but this one she loves very much! It's open so she feels like she is not in a kennel at all. I usually only kennel her when I am out of the home but most times she just walks to the door and opens the door with her paw and just chill's in it with no problems.She just Whelped 4 puppies in it and it has been working great as a whelping box for less money! I am very happy with this and will be taking this on trips and outdoor play. It is THAT EASY to assemble and take down as needed.SO HAPPY with this. If you are thinking about buying one I do recommend it very much!
5,Love it!,"We have a teacup who needs to have access to food during the day, so this works better than a regular crate. She can have her food, bed & potty park inside. We are going to purchase some more panels so she has more room to play."
4,Awesome dog pen,"I love this pen! It was simple to assemble (always a plus!) and of very good quality. One of my dogs runs into it in the morning before I'm ready to leave for work and now he sleeps in there. There is room for 3 dog beds, a water bowl and some puppy pads. The only thing I would change is that the sides are so tall, I can barely step over them to get inside the pen. I have two small dogs, 17 and 10 lbs so it would be nice to have lower sides for smaller dogs that can't jump very high."
5,Dog playpen,This playpen is well made and a good size for small breed dogs. I am very happy with it and my pups enjoy it.
5,GREAT PET PEN,Great product... I first bought one for my Pomeranian puppy and liked it so well that I bought a second one (for the same puppy) so he can have upstairs/downstairs space. I leave the door open so he can go in/out at his leisure and only close him in if we are gone. He loves his area(s) and I'm so glad that I got this product for him!
5,Iris CI-908 Pet Pen,"I loved this Doggie Pet Pen, so well built and roomy for my two dogs (Shih Tzu & Chihuahua). I use the pen as an alternative for a cage while I work. I have the 8 piece pen and have room for two beds, water bowls & toys. Kudos, to this company, very well priced as compared to other major retailers. I will use my pen indoor/outdoor."
1,"Flimsy, cheap, and terrible!!","I already had a shorter plastic exercise pen for my dog (different manufacterer) - I wanted a second one for use outside. This pen is taller than my other plastic pen; however, it is so flimsy that my small dog could push it over (or perhaps even high wind). Plus the door rattles constantly (annoying) and because the plastic is so thin I felt that my dog would chew it apart... so I returned the pen.So not all plastic exercise pens are created equal! Either get a sturdier plastic pen or go for a metal one."
2,plastic pet pen,"I purchased for my 6 week old Golden Retriever puppy. Unfortunately, I could not use it. The puppy could knock it down, very flimsy. She could jump and get caught on the top of the fence. I had thrown the box away otherwise I would have returned it."
3,Disappointed,"This is a nice play pen for our puppy, however after having it for about 2 weeks she have figured out how to climb out of it. She is about 2 months old and weighs less than 2 lbs. Needs a better design."
2,Kinda woobly and not great for my little dogs,"Easy to assemble and would be o.k. for adult dogs, puppies teeth and feet, not so much, not very sturdy and slides across floor to easily, difficult to see throughand monitor the pups."
3,"A little short, but otherwise good.","I really liked that this pen was very easy to put together, and that it's expandable.However, I have a chihuahua and a papillion, and even when we put a piece of wood over the top, they still end up escaping. If it was a little taller, it'd be perfect."
5,A profoundly deep exploration of the heart of yoga,"This DVD is by far the most impressive presentation of the integration of meditation, pranayama and asanas that I have seen. McAfee shows us in this moving and enthralling video that we can all come to a full understanding of ourselves through yoga, and through that understanding reach a state of absolute peace, joy and compassion.A must see DVD."
3,The Bromeliad Trilogy is not bad...,"Not great, but not bad. This is not part of Pratchett's famous Diskworld cycle. It's not as engaging as the Wee Free Men (which are small and blue but would never EVER be mistaken for Smurfs) It rather suggests Douglas Adams in some ways, a sort of gentle spoof of the genre of 'little people'."
5,iio cd- single,I absolutely love this band. If you like '4 strings' or 'Everything but the girl' style singing this is the band for you.
5,QUELLE VOIX!,"THIS CD PROVES THAT MS. FABIAN HAD AWESOME TALENT FROM THE START.""LEILA"" IS A GREAT, UPLIFTING TUNE, ""PUISQUE C'EST L'AMOUR"" IS QUITE SEDUCTIVE, & ""SI TU M'AMIES"" IS QUITE DRAMATIQUE. SHE'S ONE OF MY ALL-TIME FAVORITES."
4,Owls in the Family,"Owls in the Family is a great book. I give it 4 stars. The ending was so sad. I feel bad for the owls.I would recommend this book to anyone who likes sad endings,but a good beginning and ending. It wasn't the best book in the world, but it was gooooooood. I would recommend you read this book."
5,Liked alot,I liked these socks a lot. They are comfortable and it's nice to have a sock in a color other than white.
4,A valuable cache of De Sabata recordings.,"Victor De Sabata is still a familiar name in the audio market. His ""Tosca"" recording, with Callas and Di Stefano, will surely live forever. His devotees and admirers, often regretting that he committed so little of his work to recording processes, might appreciate being directed to this double CD. It reproduce a series of recordings made in Berlin in April 1939. The Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra is in top form, the acoustic is clear but dry, and the highlight is a ""white hot"" performance of the ""Tristan und Isolde"" Prelude und Liebestod. Even greater intensity emanates from a batch of four 78 sides recorded during a performance of ""Tristan und Isolde"", sung in Italian, at La Scala, Milan in 1930.Music lovers owe much to Pavilion/Pearl Records for making available a huge catalogue of historic recordings. These rare and special recordings make a valuable addition."
2,Broke After about Two Weeks,"The product worked well when it was first received, but after using the MyFI feature the unit refused to turn on. I sent the unit back to the manufacturer, but when I got it back it was still broken and will have to try again. The forums on the neuros site seem to indicate that this is a fairly common problem. This device has many feautures, but is clearly lacking in quality."
5,+ 70 years ago,"The book provides insight into a period of regional American history as experienced by the author and his family. The story depicts the life, times, struggles and accomplishments during a difficult period (years) that should not be forgotten but learned from."
5,THE BEST BOOK I'VE READ ON PADRE PIO,"I WAS SORRY TO SEE THAT ""PADRE PIO, THE PIERCED PRIEST"" IS INDEFINATELY OUT OF STOCK. I'VE LENT THIS BOOK TO SEVERAL OF MY FRIENDS AND THEY HAVE AGREED WITH MY ASSESSMENT. MR GALLAGER HAS WRITTEN A WONDERFUL, UNEMBELLISHED BOOK ON A MAN WHO IS DESTINED TO BE CANONIZED A SAINT. THANK YOU FOR PROVIDING THIS FORUM FOR COMMENTS. JANA MEIXNER"
2,"Good product, for people who like FLAT BLACK Tires!","I thought this product was Great, But I was very dissapointed when I apply it with the Sponge that comes with it, It wasn't Shine at All...""IT WAS A FLAT DOLL BLACK TIRE"" Maybe some people like it like that...I DON""T.You have to improve this product from the beginning and do not advertise it like it Shines OK.Thanks!C.A. Saint Louis, MO"
1,Poor quality dishware,"I absolutely loved the look and the price of this dishware but it has not held up well at all. I bought 8 sets and all of the salad plates, coffee cups, and bowls have all cracked or have huge chips in them. The dinner plates are the only things that haven't chipped. I am very dissatisfied with this product and am looking to buy all new dishes."
1,25 Tchaikovsky favorites.,"My comments about this recording is the same as I made for Beethovel and Chopin. I want to select specific compositions, not a hodgepodge of anything."
2,"Smoke, mirrors but no substance","I truly thought I had found a hidden gem when I came across this CD, but sadly Tia Knight let me down with this one. I love all her other work, but this CD should have stayed hidden, it was smoke and mirrors, it deceived me."
1,Too many mistakes/typos,This book has too many errors/typos in most chapters to really be helpful. I frequently had to refer to the sample code on the CD in order to see how to get the programs to work.
3,Good but not enough,"Hi, I bought the 1st edition last June. It's a good reference but not enough for passing!I think MSDN palys a great role (90%) if you really want to pass the exam.You need at lease 1 year experience with VS.NET and .NET.Good Luck"
4,Good legal thriller that kept me guessing!,"Nancy Kopp really knows her stuff. This thriller kept me guessing till the end. A comatose patient in a hospital is mysteriously raped and impregnated and a bulldog female attorney will stop at nothing to find the rapist. Fast-paced page turner. Great dialogue and memorable characters. I hated for the story to end. How about a sequel, Nancy?"
2,Boring,This is a one-time watch. It is most definately a home movie with very unprofessional editing. I was hoping for at least one or two songs to have a professional mix. Never happened...
4,Love It!,"This is pretty darn cool. An earlier poster mentioned that watching this was like watching 'Uncle Stewart's Home Movies'. Well, duh that's exactly what it is. It's shot on 8mm...what do you expect? I think this is pretty cool. Uncle Stewart should get more footage and release another DVD. Better yet...GET BACK TOGETHER!!!!"
3,Worth a look,"Stewart Copeland's pseudo-documentary about The Police, assembled with footage he shot on a Super-8 camera during the band's heyday, is noteworthy because it captures their remarkably fast climb to stardom and offers some very honest insights into why the trio called it quits after only five albums. That the movie was entirely edited, narrated and scored by Copeland is quite an achievement."
1,Don't waste your money!,"This went right from my DVD player into the garbage. This is obviously just the tape that did not make the cut for The Police Around the World, still only available used in VHS ( An excellent documentary by the way). This is a shamelessly slapped together piece of garbage to take advantage of the latest Police hype with their reunion tour by Copland. Amusingly Copland states at the end that it was time for the group to disband, as if it was a mutual choice. Please, let's not distort the fact that Sting was calling it quits at that point. Again don't waste your money!"
2,Outlandos D'Boor,"It's like being at Uncle Stuart's house while he shows you REALLY boring home movies. No content, save for Stuart Copeland's boorish, un-funny commentary. In all fairness, there are some clever shots; the occasional funny pun (Can't Stand Losing Ewe) and it's clear Copeland really enjoyed the creative outlet the super 8 camera gave him on the road, but it doesn't excuse his blase attitude.If you want a charming, fully realized memoir from a member of The Police, do yourself a favor and read Andy Summer's book, ""One Train Later."" It's BRILLIANT."
5,These used prices are nuts!,"This book is effectively in print -- the latest printing was 2002 -- and you can still get new copies from bonsaimonk.com or bonsai-bci.com/books.htm, among others. I'm sure eventually amazon will get some copies with the next printing -- they've been coming out every two to three years. Until then, don't pay $50 for this book used. And yes, as another reviewer said, he does sign almost every copy -- so don't pay extra for the collectibles!And yes, it is a terrific piece of work -- like being walked through a hands-on class by a tutor who demonstrates all the possible mistakes along the way by showing, not telling. Very pleasing to the eye as well, for a micro-publisher's book.--Shayana Kadidal"
2,A lot about very little,I regret buying this book. It covers a lot of material but has very little about each item. If you really need the detail look elsewhere
5,Excellent,"This is the best guitar ""how to"" book I have found. Wonderful pictures, easy to understand diagrams and just enough theory to wet the apetite for more. Spend one day with this book and your guitar and you will learn chords, scales, and more and actually understand how the guitar is supposed to work!"
2,"Nice coffee table book, but far from complete",I bought this book based on the other two reviews - largely because I thought it was a fairly complete and useful reference. It actually only covers the subject superficially and only includes a very small percentage of the pocket watches made. Many classics are not mentioned at all. Very little information is provided on makers. As a picture book w/brief history and sampling of watches its okay but ... It's mostly a coffee table book rather than a thorough informative reference.
4,Good Moview,"These are three really good Harlequin movies. Remember, you can preview these movies when they come on Lifetime. Like the books they are a good watch. Here are the titles of the movies and what it says on the back to help you decide if you want to make the purchase.Recipe for RevengeCarly witnesses TV star Chester Winnifield murder her friend and her friend's date. She tells Detective Brannigan, but Winnifield has an alibi and Carly finds herself in hot water.Hard to ForgetSleuth Max Warner sets out to prove that Sandra was killed by her husband, John. He enlists the help of her twin, Nicky, to trap him in to confessing the murder.Treacherous BeautiesA photojournalist suspects her brother's death was no accident. Assuming a false identity, she navigates the treaterous waters of the powerful Hollister family and finds herself falling in love with the man who may have murdered her brother."
1,Ever Thought...,"Have you ever thought to put yourself in Glass' shoes? Maybe then you might understand why he did what he did. He wanted to succeed and in doing so he lied...he thought he would get away with it but he didn't. I, like many have to admit that lying and fabricating something is horrible and wrong but I just can't help but feel sorry for him. Glass is just like us, making mistakes and learning from them. I bet he knows what he did was wrong but what can he do about it now than say sorry over and over again? He wrote this book to show us the story from his point of view. Instead of being angry and saying what a waste of money this book was, understand what he is going through. It started with the want to succeed, the fear of someone discovering his lies, the denial of doing something wrong and then the embarrassment when everyone knows what he did. I for one respect him as a person even though I don't agree with his actions from the past. All he wanted to do was succeed, wasn't it?"
2,shattered expectations,"I had high hopes for this novel, assuming that this true life fabulist would really be able to spin a good yarn. Unfortunately, the novel spins out of control and ends up being a series of vignettes, strung together by a loose structure. I must admit, there were anecdotes that made me laugh out loud (the airplane scene), but ultimately I did not care about this character's journey or relationships or future. Perhaps when this author has a little more life experience I will give him another try, but The Fabulist is ultimately a narcissistic apology for a journalism no-no."
1,Steal this book. Then burn it.,"I borrowed this book from my local library because I wanted to read it before I saw the film Shattered Glass. I couldn't help but notice this irony: Glass is much better at presenting fiction as the truth than the truth as fiction. What can you say about someone who wrote such compelling articles for The New Republic, which were totally fabricated, and then writes this incredibly boring so called ""novel"". Don't refuse to buy this book for all the overwhelming moral reasons. Refuse to buy it beacause it is a poorly written piece of junk. Take the money that you save and go see Shattered Glass. It's the best movie about journalism since All the President's Men. Anyone who gives this claptrap a positive review is related to the author. It could even be Glass himself!"
1,Eeew.,"Nobody's said anything yet about the repulsively twee, incomparably false sex-and-romance scenes, which are surely among the worst ever to be set into type. I surmise that Glass thinks he's showing his hot-blooded hetero side, but the lovey-dovey bits could have been written by a virgin girl of 14 years."
4,Stargate Atlantis wont play on out TV,"The quality is good but we live in Australia and our problem is that we can only watch the DVD's on our computer as they won't play on our DVD and TV. There must be something wrong with the formatting oe something, but we can watch them on the computer which is ok but disappointing."
5,WOW!,"I thought I was buying 1 box with all four seasons in it. What I got was each season in thier own box as if I bought them seperately. They were bound with shrink wap. I've been watching them over and over. I'm looking foreword to getting season 5! Don't have seasons 1-4, this is the BEST way to get them NOW!"
1,Did not receive the TV,I have not received the TV yet. I am very frustrated. I order this TV and paid immediately and still waiting 2 months later.
3,Had me till Prague....,"I was enjoying this story about finding oneself after bitter disappointment, till our intrepid brothers hit Prague. I guess it was important for Franz to let the readers know he was ""gettin' some"" on the road, but his retelling of his ""romantic encounters"" left me snickering. First he gets all ""old fashioned"" when he finds out the Russian girl performing certain favors is in fact a prostitute. Then he spends several days in Prague bedding a girl all the while mocking her English and pretending to sneak out of town rather than just saying goodbye. Didn't exactly make him out to be much of a catch afterall......"
2,The best part of this book is the title,"I got about a third of the way through this book and gave up on it. The story potential is fantastic, but the writing just wasn't enough to hold my interest. The whole thing struck me as really superficial. It's more a recitation of this happened and then this happened and we did this and we did that. If he'd had a real writer write the book with him it could have been great. I so wanted to like the book. I'm glad I only borrowed it from the library."
1,It's that guy!,"Do you have an annoying friend who, let's say, buys a motorcycle, and two days later considers himself a seasoned expert and proceeds to condescendingly lecture you on the finer points of all things motorcycle related? Well guess what-- that guy wrote a book about travelling!"
2,Just okay,"Not very impressed with this book, was written very poorly and the author comes off as a spoiled american who is quite self-centered.I liked the chapters about specific countries, but felt that he skipped over them too quickly. Borrow a friends or check it out of the library, not worth the $$."
1,Protect your electronics... buy something else.,"I bought this adapter so that I could charge my Zune from a wall socket... bad idea. The power output fluctuates too much, activating the touchscreen, accessing media, scrolling around, etc. without any user input. I suggest that you protect your electronics from unstable signals by spending more money for something that will actually keep your gadgets in working order."
1,yucky bitter peanuts,I bought some wasabi peanuts last summer at an arts festival. They were sweet and hot and delicious. These are not the same. The Emerald brand wasabi peanuts had very little wasabi flavor (hot) and they weren't sweet either. They had a slight bitter after taste. I do not recommend them.
1,Not too much punch.,"I expected spicy nuts. I got bitter nuts. If you are expecting a wasabi taste, you will not get one. Do not buy."
3,Not bad for the first time,"I was already anticipating this novel because I read Rasing Fences.So I was all ready for this to blow me away,with them being married and all.I won't say I was dissapointed with the book I just expected more depth or more expression of her emotions to everything that happend in her life.More drama.It was just a good book.The was she discribes the thoughts that women have I could relate to that. I also liked the smoothness of Mingus' boyfriend,Eric.He was the only character that you really could see into his personality.All of the rest were just people in a story to me."
4,Honest,"My intesrest in this book stemmed from reading Michael Datcher's ""Rasising Fences"" where he mentioned this book. I read it in 3 nights. It was a real page turner-a must read!! I kinda got the feeling though, that it was to be continued...Overall, it was a touching, honest story and I recommend it."
2,My first time reading this author,"I read it but like Sela Bed didn't really remember the story, just thought it was kind of interesting but not not a memorable book."
2,Item not in 'new' condition,"I received the book in a media mailer. The binding was unglued and the jacket cover had a ripped corner. I was told I would get a replacement right away. I have sent the damaged book back, to be told by UPS that there is no business at the address I had. They are holding my returned book. The book, ordered on Nov 17, was a Christmas present and on Dec 21, I still don't have the replacement."
3,Pretty Good,"This Is A Pretty Good Well Done Compilation Of Some Of The Best Rappers Out There.While It'sA Little Strange To Make A Compilation Alblum Based On A Management Company,It's Still Good.While All The Songs Were Good There Were Clearly No Standouts."
2,violator - the album,"this is one of those albums that if you heard it back when it came out in 1999, you would have thought it was pretty decent, but the more you listen to it, the more you realize that it's at best an average album, and that's being optimistic.*vivrant thing...it's a nice song...but get q-tip's amplified to get a better feel of it. it sticks out like a sore thumb on this album.*whatcha come around here for...a nice flipmode song.*the rest of the album is horrible until the late middle, the thugged out posse cut is (yawn) ok, big noyd's cut is good, then the beatnuts, cam'ron, mysonne's solo cut, busta rhymes's bus-a-bus remix, and the violators collab cut at the end are the best songs. everything else is trash. i wouldn't waste my money buying this...but i did a long time ago."
5,Excellent album - buy both,"Wish I knew what happened to this artist. It does not Sound like the other HIsham Abbas I found on Amazon. I bought both back in the 90's and still play them all the time i the car, at home and when I travel in my hotel room. No one else makes music like this."
2,"Pretty, but the paint is coming off just shortly after receiving it (yuck!)","I really like most attributes of this toy (or rather my son does), but the paint issue really irks me. I unfortunately hope I can still return it because my son can't play with it. Even if the paint is nontoxic, I still don't want my 4 month old son to ingest it. Shame, really, because it is otherwise quite cute and well constructed."
1,Serge Gainsbourg?,What a disappointment! I had heard nothing but excellent comments about Gainsbourg's genius. What genius? This stuff has nothing I'm interested in and I regret the few bucks I spent buying it.
3,"Bottom-Level Serviceable Sci-Fi, which in 2011 is saying a lot","Dennis Hopper was in Space Truckers, well done high budget sci-fi. Tycus is get-it-done low budget, but does not fall down. The conceit that just one group knows and prepares for the end focuses the camera on a few judicious interchanges about the general morality of survival of the few in the face of great loss. For science types, it offers an innovative disaster scenario."
4,Great buy!,"The book is in solid condition. Although, I don't know why the product description says paperback because it's definitely a hardback copy. I was happy to receive the hardback too since my local bookstore only offered paperback. The spine is in decent condition (it tends to lean to one side) but the contents are all intact and pages are great. There are some pencil markings but I don't mind them because sometimes they help me out with studying, etc."
4,Did you know...,"Seeing so many comments here about the character of Holly Golightly, I wonder how many people realize that she was written to represent Capote's friend, Marilyn Monroe."
4,Great read,"If you've never read Truman Capote, this is the place to start. The included short stories are quite wonderful too."
5,"beautiful, effin' brilliant.",prose that dances and characters that do more than suffice. its every month or so that i read this book over.. its such a treat.
5,A Wonderful Book,"I first picked up this book at about age 10( after seeing the movie a while back) and couldnt grasp it, now at 13 i read and loved this book. I love the way capote writes, and Holy is an amzing character, who has woderful development during the story. If u have seen the movie, and other old ones by hepburn u can see her playing holly perfectly."
5,The best and most readable reference on catamaran sailing,I find myself reviewing this book before I hit the water. After I return from the day's sailing I refer to it again to try and understand how I can improve on what I done that day. Rick White and Mary Wells have the ability to clearly explain the basics of boat handing and racing tactics in readable and direct language. The book is not afraid of stating an opinion where there are several points of views. It also discusses these views. I recommend this book to anyone at any level of catmaran sailing.
5,Antixidant Revolution,"Interesting book about free radicals from the doctor who coined the term ""aerobics"". You will increase your knowledge of free radicals and the damage they cause to us all. The solution is out of date based on new research in the last 7 years."
5,disapointed with shipping charge,"I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE THE H6228 SHOP PRESS BUT THE $94.00 SHIPPING CHARGE KEEPS ME FROM BUYING THE ITEM, IT SEEMS REALLY TOO HIGH, SORRY"
3,don't expect a perfect close cut,"I was a professional barber in the past but unfortunetly my faders died so I replaced my wharl silvers with these and Im dissapionted at how bad they perform.I adjusted clippers all the time but no matter how much you adjust these clippers the blades will not cut close or bald so expect an unevencut.The motor is very weak also,I wish I had stuck with a wharl brand fader for a much better hair cut.The only good thing about this purchase was the customer service but this clipper is a waste of money honestly.I would never recommend these."
5,Another Great Read,"I have read every book written by Tom. If you like the thriller genre from authors like Tom Clancy, Dale Brown, etc, you must read this work. Tom's previous works are also well worth a look and read.Looking forward to his next work."
3,Not what I expected,"I actually expected a booklet. All you get is a single piece of paper folded like a map. The descriptions are OK, and it does point out locations accurately. But, I really expected more."
4,Food Glorious Food,"This little movie, and it seems a disservice to call it that, is so charming and touching, that it's on my permanent top ten list. The performances are subtle and the food, oh my God the food! Did I forget the music? The soundtrack is one of the best to listen to while cooking Italian. Plot has been covered by others, so I'll stick with tiny details, the faces of the stuffed diners, the conga line, the women's chat and the timpano...oh the timpano! I made this dish at home (over 3 days) and it was glorious. My favorite part of the movie though, is the final scene, shot in one-take, of Segundo preparing breakfast. No words, just acting (and cooking). Excellent, like the rest of it."
5,On My Best 10 list,"I first saw this film when it was first released, over ten years ago. I have watched it several times since, and it keeps getting better every time. It is so sparse, and yet so full. So much is left unsaid, and yet deeply felt. It is the portrayal of this relationship between two brothers of completely different temperament, but who deeply care about each other, and united by a dream that binds them, which is most moving. The very last scene, when they commune around the simplest and most symbolic of foods, with not a word (but a wonderful soundtrack of noises that heighten the silence) is a masterpiece of understatement.Big Night is, and will remain, one of the ten and probably five best movies I have ever seen.Y."
2,"Halfway in, I lost interest.","I don't have any complaints about the writing per se, but there was something about it that kept me at a distance. I found myself caring less and less the farther along I got into the book. I began to dread Elizabeth's scenes. Around the middle of the book I just stopped reading. I guess with all the perspective changes, I could never put myself in anybody's shoes. I identified with no one.More people have liked this book than not, so I'm in the minority, so you might give it a go."
2,Not so great,The ending was very anticlimactic and a lot of the book that's useless writing and rambling about things that weren't too important to the storyline. I would Not recommended this book for anyone that likes true thrillers.
2,Light reading,"The book is merely ok, nothing too great to be found here. I think I am going back to paying full prices for books, these 'deals' are anything but."
2,Lots of gore and nothing more,"The author gives the reader a healthy serving of blood and gore, but the story is only marginally believable at best and the prose serviceable at best. Two thumbs down on this one."
4,Shame,The whole bookkeeper you guessing and you never know who is behind all the madness. Beautifully written as well. Loved it
5,Shame-Excellent Read!,Thought the book was an excellent suspense/thriller. Couldn't put it down! Read it in 2 days!Alan Russell is great!
4,"Riveting, dark & hard to put down",The book is a must read if you like Dexter because the serial killer story is very popular now. However the author finds a unique perspective with the son of a serial killer and how you survive in a world that hates everything you are.The secondary characters such as the drag queen adds color to the plot. My favorite part of the book was the notable lines that really stuck with me.I definitely recommend this book because it's a fun read and you don't see the twist at the end coming.
3,okay read,I had this figured out about half way into the book. It is the second Alan Russell book I've read and enjoyed both.
3,Fast Read,The book was a fast read. The last 30 pages or so was the best part of the book with a lot of suspense!
3,Difficult to keep track.....,"It was difficult for me to keep track of exactly where the characters and the story was at certain times. Even though I read every day, it is necessary for me to read short sections at a time and that may be the reason I lose track. Overall, the story itself was good."
4,Good read!,"Enjoyable to read. I would have liked to have seen more of Lola, however I thought what (s)he did for Caleb to be quite admirable. I will be reading more of Mr. Russell's works."
3,Entertaining,"This was fairly well written, with strong characters, although none of the main characters are even remotely likable except Lola. The peripheral relationships are weak but rightfully so, and flawed main characters predictably are""all better""by the last page."
4,Tons of toys to play with,My 6 month old loves to play with all of these different toys. More things for him to grab and stuff in his mouth!
5,Great Gift!,"This was one of the best gifts I got when my son was born. We used the rings right away, because he enjoyed seeing them hanging from his swing. We also put the suction cup toy on the window by his changing table to keep him happy during diaper changes. As soon as he started reaching and grabbing, he reached for them. We have brought out the other toys as he has grown. He is 7 months now, and loves the rattles and teether (and still loves the rings.) This is little box-o-fun is a great value."
3,Very different,"This is not for the everyday listening. If you buy it, you won't have the guts to listen to it more than once or twice in a year...Very dark and far from humanity, scarse poetic dazzling, very ""dry"" and not a musical masterpiece.It's value resides mainly in it's experimental trend and in the fact that it is now a rarity (I exchanged my copy many years ago and feel kind of sorry for that, although I had no intention on listening to it very often...)."
4,Excellent overview of a complex art,"Bil Baird's book is a lushly illustrated overview of the art of puppetry. While hardly scholarly on the historical view of puppetry, it does manage to make one look twice at something that too often is dismissed as ""kid stuff"". A must have for someone who loves the wide variety of the world's performing arts."
3,Not for all tastes...unless...,As a writer I was pleased with the emotions and inner feelings presented by the characters involved yet it made me wonder...why did all the great writers have such painful sexual lives? The NC-17 rating is enough to scare some people away...
4,Mellencamp reworked,"Sure John Mellencamp was fulfilling his Mercury record contract, but I like this idea much more than another greatest hits record or live album.An early reviewer said it best this CD is Mellencamp Unplugged. Mellencamp and his band took a number of his early songs and based on old interviews or two, I think these are some of his favorite songs and reworked them. The CD sounds like the Studio C CDs put out by radio station KBCO each year.The songs are given a country style and some come out in a more enjoyable. I especially enjoy ""Love and Happiness"" in this style. I've always like ""Human Wheels"" and the covers, ""Farewell Angelina"", ""Under the Boardwalk"" and ""In My Time of Dying"" are excellent. Two other gems are ""Between a Laugh and a Tear"" and ""Jackie Brown."" The whole effort gives you a feel of a concert in a small bar.This is a CD for Mellencamp fans and shouldn't be looked at as a complement to his greatest hits CD. Keep that in mind and you will enjoy this CD."
5,Mellencamp Unplugged,"Just flip in this cd, close your eyes and you will think that John and his band are in your living room actully playing just for you. In this cd john takes his famous songs and records them with a different twist, some slower and easier and some quicker and smoother. It really is so cool I wish that many other artists would do this with their music. Instead of putting out some live cd or a greatest hits. If your a Mellencamp fan or not, you will like this cd."
1,Don't bother,"This is Mellencamp's way of milking the fans out of little more money. Rough Harvest is a joke. Not only does Mellencamp make a mockery of these songs, but he also sings (if you want to call it that)as though he's reading from a lyric sheet. Just listen to Between A Laugh and a Tear, and you'll see. Mellencamp will have to release a complete ""Best of"" one day. If he keeps this up, an official ""best of"" will be his only source of income."
5,A book from a Master,"I believe I have about every faux finishing and stenciling book out there. I am a professional faux finisher and stenciler and so when I heard Melanie Royals put out a book in addition to her wonderful videos, I immediately bought it. It is one of the better books since she combines techniques with both stencils (windows, draperies, florals, etc.)and tape (carved wood moldings). She also includes faux finishing techniques (limestone, skyscapes, bricks) and good pro tips throughout. This is a wonderful book for the beginner since it gives clear and concise directions and for the advanced stenciller since it touches on perspective, creating multi-overlay stencils and providing project pictures to get the creative juices flowing for those of us who do this professionally. A must buy book written by a noted Master."
3,It works,I have a husky and she hasnt seemed to pull this out of the ground...yet. It seems promising! it is durable and is a good length to stake in the ground so the dogs cant pull it up!
5,Simply the best,I LOVE these pens. Superb quality. Beautiful colors. They come in a very nice case. Looking forward to purchasing more in the near future. Would also make a lovely gift.
5,Great so far!,"I was worried about ordering this at first. It seemed pricey compared to other products on Amazon. Seeing the great reviews, I took the risk...I'm one of those obsessive note takers who HAVE to write in color. It makes me want to actually study.. is that weird? Well, ever since the school year started, I've been buying so many pens because I run out so quickly. I take about five pages of notes a day, and by the end of the day, some of my colors run out. It frustrates me.But not with this set of 20! It glides on and dries perfectly. No skips! Though I've only been using them for a couple of days, I would totally recommend it! I've fallen so in love."
5,Easier to install than expected,My sons 07 c2500hd hauling camper was the reason for thispurchase. We did the install in his garage with no problemsand it holds the extra weight of his camper with no problem.Loves It!
1,broken within 2 months,"my phone was activated in january, and was used very lightly in the past two months. the earpiece is already shorting out, and a replacement is unavailable in any local stores, as they carry the more popular panasonic and nokia gear. 2 weeks shipping for a part which is required by LAW in many states is unacceptable. run from this! get a phone with speakerhone option."
3,Written from the Mother's Viewpoint,"Often books about multiples are written from either the therapist's or the multiple's perspective, or some combination there of. This, on the other hand, looks at multiplicity from the family's perspective, detailing how they handle it from pre-diagnosis to integration and beyond. The best thing about this is that the family isn't perfect. They get tired and they screw up. They are heavily impacted by Alex's ""condition."" If you are a in a multiple's life, this one may make you feel less guilty about the mishaps. And if you are a multiple, it may help you understand those living on the other side of the fence a bit better."
5,GOOD CONQUERS EVIL,"This book was fascinating, I couldn't put it down. However, it is very graphic. Many people will find their belief systems challenged by this book, but personally I do believe every word of it. Alex's foster-parents(particularly his Mum), deserve medals; they never gave up on him. With their love and support, Alex eventually overcomes the demons(literally) that are driving him to insanity. On a downward note, his abusers were never brought to justice, and after reading this book it is easy to feel total despair for the whole Human race; however, when you think of the kindness, compassion and goodness of people like Alex's foster parents, who are the complete antithesis of Alex's abusers, you do think that maybe, just maybe, there is hope for us all."
3,unbelievable,"this book is a little unbelievable.the horse connection is just unbelievable.its impossible to believe that such things can happen openly.however, the book is written well and kudos to the author for taking on such a challenge .the author is an angel for adopting alex when he was as wild as an animal .on the whole , the magic castle is worth a read but some people might not believe the things that happened to alex."
1,Unplayable,"Yes, the graphics aredisappointing, and the game physics lags well behind Papyrus's NASCAR Racing 2003. But what really takes the cake with this game is the bugginess, especially with yellow and black flag rules. Under a yellow flag, you follow the on-screen and spotter directions, and you will likely get black-flagged for passing someone you weren't supposed to. if you slow down to get in the right spot, you will be black flagged. If there is a wreck in front of you and you pass a wrecked car after the caution - black flag! I tried about 30 times and not ONCE did I finish a race without getting black flagged for some absurd reason. Papyrus figured out how to fix these problems years ago, but the EA monopoly doesn't have to, apparently. NASCAR SimRacing is an absolutely unplayable game and I have sent it back for a refund. Don't waste your time and money!"
1,Does not work,"This item is not compatible with Windows 7. I knew it could be a problem when I bought it, but I hoped that my computer would adjust so I could use it. It would not run. I plan to have a computer tech look at the situation. May be they can get it to work."
1,EA Sports Nascar Simracing,This game turned out to be a real disappointment. EA Sports really dropped the ball. The only support for this much in need of a patch game is the online community. I am not very optimistic about the union of Nascar and EA Sports.
2,Disappointed User,"Everything in the game as far as graphics and feel are awesome, however; the online play is far from as described on the box. There are several issues that have made online racing with a full field and flag rules virtuously impossible. The patch that came out was useless and created more issues with online play. EA has lots of work to do to make this a viable option for online play. I have been very disappointed with EA's response or lack of to the complaints. To my knowledge EA has not done anything to correct the many complaints that my Online Racing League has sent."
2,Nascar Sim Racing,"Although the graphics on this game are awsome. There is alot of problems with the game. I like to race the longer races at the shorter track,but i'm never am able to finish because i will be black flagged under caution or something on those lines. You dont even have to do anything wrong and you'll be black flagged and disqualified. It reminds me of a playstation/xbox game to much. the reason i get the computer racing games is because their always more realistic with chassis setips and driving style. I wish Serria or Papyrus could get the rights back because thats when the games was good. I will not buy anymore racing games for my PC if they are made by EA sports. EA sports games are great for playstaion but not PC. So if your looking for the latest Nascar racing game thats good. Then buy Nascar Racing 2002 or 2003. They still have the realistic affects"
5,Havana Flute Summit,"I think from what I've heard on this cd plus thinking about these artist and the way and style they play ""I wish there would be more artist like this in the world"" this is one of the best or the best cd i myself have heard in a long time._________________""EL DON DE MIAMI"""
5,"Great Card, fragile antenna","I have bought two of these cards and the range is incredible. It works great in Linux also. In case you need an external antenna, it uses a reverse polarity MMCX connector. The only problem I have had is the little tab antenna will eventually break if you keep taking it off and putting it back on. That is OK, because i have two of these cards and use one only with the tab antenna and the other with my external antennas."
1,Warning: This is an Illegal DVD,I represent the copyright holder of this film. The owner of BLOOD SALVAGE has not authorized a DVD release of this motion picture. This is most certainly a cheap copy of an old laserdisc or VHS video. The copyright holder will be contacting the US Justice Department and the Motion Picture Association to report this FEDERAL OFFENSE. It is against the law to sell unauthorized DVD copies of copyrighted material.
2,Cornball vocals from Brazil,"EMI's ""Cantores Do Radio"" series is a great look at the popular singers who came before the bossa nova era... plus, with two CDs at a single CD price, these are a pretty sweet deal. As far as this one goes, well... I guess somebody had to become Brazil's answer to Johnny Ray and Robert Goulet, and all the rest of those scary '50s/'60s male pop vocalists whose orphaned albums once haunted our thrift store bins. This particular brand of corn doesn't move me, but if you're into exploring the kitschier side of Brazilian pop, these Lawrence Welk-worthy oldies could certainly be of interest. Plenty of cover tunes, including a version of Conway Twitty's ""Only Make Believe,"" which came out around the same time as the original..."
1,Works great when it actually stays in the USB port.,I bought this product inorder to install it on a computer that was to narrow to accept full width network cards. From day 1 this device has given me problems. For starters it won't even stay seated in the USB port which causes my computer to be on the network at one moment and off the other. The device is also somewhat flimsy. I don't recommend it at all.
1,I would not recommend this DVD,"The narration was cheaply done which distracted from the tour of the castles and chateaux', which was also poorly done."
4,"Good, but Confusing!!!!","I think this book is really god, but extrmemley confusing. At first I couldn't figure out what was going on, but I got it eventually (by the middle of the book)It is entertaining, but some parts are not for the squeamish. A little graphic detail, but the story is all the richer for it. I would recommend it to people who like ghost stories. I would also reccommend you read Diana Wynne Jones other books."
5,Great Library Addition,"For several years I have been building a library of reference material to assist me in understanding the ecology and rehabilitation of madrean oak savanna and grasslands in southeast Arizona. As a layman in the ecological sciences but rehabilitation practitioner on my own land, I found this book to be very useful and readable. An excellent addition to a library for those seeking to build a general understanding of savanna vegetative interactions and management. I also recommend The Desert Grassland for those specifically interested in southern Arizona."
4,nice perfume but smell a bit different..,Shipped relatively fast - and well packaged. Only minor problem with this perfum is that it does not EXACTLY smell like the predecessor. Not sure if this is because its a slightly modified scenet or because of another reason. It still smells great but a tad more tart than the original (the very first Hot Couture).
5,One of the very very best!,"I cannot believe they discontinued this product. I have received so many compliments on it. I must have over 50 bottles of top of the line expensive perfumes on my dresser and I rate this Top 3! My sister is like me. She has tons and tons and tons of perfumes and this is her ""go to"" number one! She loves it! My mom is not a perfume person and even she loves it. I wore it on my first date with my husband! This is one of those perfumes that you can buy without smelling first and you will just love it! I promise! ( I don't recommend the lotion or cream..they smell a little different)"
4,For the biggest Joe Elliott/Def Leppard fans,"If you want to have all the good stuff Joe Elliott has ever done, this is a good addition to the collection. ""When Saturday Comes"" is a rocking tribute to something Joe cares about, English football! The rest of the album is listenable, as well. I first heard this song on a Leppard bootleg album called ""Etcetera"" and had to search to find out the source material. You won't be dissapointed if you a real Joe Elliott or Def Leppard fan!"
3,"Lower price, lower quality","We go through lots of these pads so I thought I'd save some money and time and get a stack from Amazon. Well the price is lower than our local office supply store, but so is the quality--the paper is thinner and the sheets do not rip off as easily.However, as I said, they're definitely cheaper so it depends what the pads are used for. For our needs--reminders, directions, phone conversations, etc.00these work quite well. Not sure I would include a sheet in a package to a client though."
3,Legal pads,"My items was shipped with speed& care. I have a problem with product itself. Topps seems to have cut way back on the quality of the pads. The paper seems to be of a lesser weight & the pages are not glued properly. Because of the bad glueing, the pages keep falling out the pad, so your notes & writings can be easily lost. I don't know if Topps cut quality to save money, but I am far from happy with their product."
5,Great characters!,"Barganier's book is exciting and fast-paced. This book gives a truly unique look into the brokerage industry as well as revealing not well known facts about the international, illegal trade in human body parts. Remarkably, Mr. Barganier has brought these two intriguing subjects together, creating what I thought was a great novel. I sometimes felt like some of the things in his book were really happening. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who reads this review. You will not be sorry."
3,It really brings the composer to life!,I've been researching Debussy's Piano Music as part of my degree and I found this book to be fascinating because it revealed the composer to me in a new light.It's a completely enjoyable book to read; reliable and relevant to his music
3,Don't trust the anecdotes,"Ross loves little anecdotes about how this or that supplement worked miracles for someone in 20 minutes or 2 days. Don't believe it. I am trying her supplement program and, if it works at all, it takes weeks or months to take effect. I spent a fortune on this stuff, so I will continue until it's gone, but so far I have nothing to show for it except a depleted wallet."
3,Tons of information. Sometimes too much.,"It can get a bit tedious at times and if you buy all the recommended supplements, you'll be spending a fortune. However, I did think the research was thorough and they had some really great points. Worth highlighting before passing along to someone."
5,Great colander set at a great price,"First learned about this product on America's Test Kitchen/Cooks Illustrated. It's terrific; drains beautifully; small items don't go down the drain; and, more important, they're easier to clean than the wire baskets I'd been using. I was delighted to find a set of 3 for about the same price as one in the catalogs."
5,wonderful,I like the 80's music. I had one of these same cds but something happened and it wouldn't work anymore. I was happy to see that you had it. Very happy. I am very satisfied - I love listening to it. Thanks!
3,bought it for my son,"I gave my son a tape player with my old lady tapes (he's in his forties) and he had texted me to include oldies for nostalgia...well I only had whale sounds, relaxation and meditation tapes to give him...so I ordered some from different eras and on a budget. If I was trying to wow him my order would have been more specific but I had to rely on generalized cheaper (not collectors items) tapes so he could have the nostalgia on my budget. This will do that."
1,Overkill,"The fact that this book describes a ""pattern"" named PreciseAndReadable should tell you what you need to know. If you need to be told that use cases should be precise and readable, or that you should name them with active verb phrases (VerbPhraseName), or that they should describe things of value to the business people (UserValuedTransactions), or that you should involve those people in the process of writing them (ParticipatingAudience), or that you should stop writing them when they make those people happy (QuittingTIme), you'll certainly get some value from this book, but it's clear evidence that your problems run considerably deeper than this book will be able to address.This represents 25 pages of fundamentally simple content spread across 200 pages, and in a thoroughly pretentious manner to boot. Avoid."
1,Use cases written by analysts for analysts,"This is a good book if you plan to have business analysts writing use cases for other business analysts. It is a lousy book if the audience for your use cases are subject matter experts and technical people/engineers/developers. The ""good"" examples have all technical details stripped from them supposedly to make them easier to read; in actuality this makes them easier to read for BAs, but useless for anyone else. Details this book recommends ignoring as ""design"" or ""implementation"" are actually implied requirements that are derived from non-functional or legacy constraints.Use cases can be a useful supplement for the ""200 page traditional IEEE ... functional requirements"", provided they have sufficient technical detail and traceability. Non-technical use cases used to replace traditional requirements is a recipe for project disaster."
2,Item seems good so far. Parts were missing,"Disk plates were missing, had to make them myself. Air bags would not sit vertically. Nevertheless, air springs work."
3,A Well Penned Satire,"I enjoyed this one, though the first one, The Pooh Perplex, is much more light-hearted and fun to read. Beware, some people might not understand that this is a farce and that you're supposed to be laughing at all the wacky ways we humans have devised to dissect, examine, and critique the universe in our isolated academic ivory towers. But as long as you don't mind people looking at you strangely as you laugh out loud on the bus, you'll be just fine."
5,Fun for squid fans of all ages!,"I received this fabulous plush giant squid for Christmas. I have to second what the other reviewer has said about this squid; it is extremely true to life! I was very impressed! From its large sized eyes (the giant squid has the largest eyeballs in the animal kingdom!) to the tip of its tentacles, this squid is anatomically correct. Not seen in the picture, the squid has a realistic siphon and beak. It's also super soft, and I'd recommend it for squid-lovers young and old!"
2,poor quality of incense,My incense purchased do not burn well as if they were once wet or damaged. I have to repeatedly re-light the same stick of incense.
1,Like sleeping on concrete,"We recieved this item in a timely manner. That is the only good thing we can say about it. This is not our first memory foam pad and so we were excited to be ordering a new one. Our older one was about 10 years old and not what it had once been. when this came it looked just like a foam pad...nothing like memory foam, but since the density was different we decided yo give it a try. Have you ever slept on the floor? That is what this pad is like. There is no memeory to this foam...it never recovers so it is lumpy and hard. With artritis this has been too much to bear. Do youself a favor and buy from someone else."
1,les miserables,"I wish I had known this movie was a screen copy, I would never have purchased this one...I purchased from this seller because of the high score...It is very distracting when a notice appears several times during the movie saying that this movie is not for sale or rent and to call an 800 number about it...I intend to purchase another one in hopes of getting a much better quality movie that I can watch without these distractions...I would advise buyers to be aware that this can happen even from a high score seller..."
4,DVD DOES NOT HAVE SUBTITLES OR 2ND LANGUAGE!,"Amazon combined the reviews of the VHS and DVD vesions. I purchased this DVD as a present for my sister. One of the reviews states that there are subtitles. But Amazon has combined the reviews for the DVD and the VHS version. THERE ARE NO SUBTITLES OR SECOND LANGUAGES ON THE DVD! I will be selling mine on ebay. Always kind of sad when vendors let misinformation sell more products for them. It's pretty clear they don't care, because, supposedly, the reviews are checked before being posted online. Shame on you, Amazon! Four stars for the movie, minus one for amazon."

3,Jocelyn Brown is at it again!,"Wow. The 8th album from the diva. She has worked with the Harlem disco wizard Patrick Adams and with the groups Igongito, Musique, and has recorded with Inner Life with the hit ""I'm Caught Up (In A One Night Love Affair). She has release mutiple albums with the groups and currently retired from the music scene. This is the one-hit wonder diva that we've been looking for."
1,yuk,taste terrible.and clumps.i have a plastic shaker and it still does not get rid of the clumps.nice customer service.came through the mail quickly but taste terrible
5,Great product,"This I take in the morning with milk, yogurt, banana and mixed fruit and lecithin. Gives me lots of energy and don't get hungry."
4,My dog loved this bed.,"My small dog (shih-tzu mix) really liked this bed. She pulled the pillow out, laid in the bed upside down. Dug in the bottom corner play hunting for rodents. Basically it was a bed and a toy, until one day she completely tore it apart and I came upon a scene of foam strewn about the room. I would buy another one though. I just wish the stitching were a bit stronger."
5,A fantastic piper,"The piping heard from Ian Mac Fayden's in this great CD reminded me of all the great pipers I have had the privilege to hear, with the added benefit of a superb recording. MacFayden's fingering of his chanter in every tune he plays is just right, if it might be called that. I shall never regret having ordered this beautiful CD"
5,An Excellent Guide To The Mind,"Craig Karges obviously knows his stuff. He has a great knack for making things understandable and useable.The entire book is great reading, however, I would like to comment that his section on self-hypnosis and the ""quiet mind"" is amongst the very best I have ever read on the topic. His tips on how to record a self hypnosis tape are fantastic.My only negative comment about the book is that it's too short. Not content wise, it's just that time flys when you read it, and I hope that he comes out with another soon...perhaps with more experiments with the mind.Overall: A great book."
5,Made a little boy happy!,Service was excellent and it was just what my grandson wanted. It has seen a lot of use as he is playing catcher this year. It is holding up well.
2,"Julia has a wonderful voice, please listen to it............","When I first herad Julia sing, I thought I was listening to Barbra Striesand. Their vocies sound very similiar to each other.Julia is an opera star who has done a wonderful job with crossover projects. Her voice is well suited to sing both kinds of material. Julia has a very smooth delivery. Her voice is very controllable, but very entertianing. I really like her style of song.I would like to encourge music fans out there to give Julia a listen. She will not disappoint you."
4,Nice Item,"Quick shipping and a nice item. Everything fit me perfectly and looked like professional quality. However, the zipper does seem like it gets stuck every now and then...I was scared I was going to break it."
5,Great Entertainment!!,"After watching season one of ""In Plain Sight"" and totally enjoying it, we were excited to view season two. Story line continued from season one, but wouldn't be confusing to someone not seeing the first. Usually humor and suspense are not used in the same sentence to describe a movie, but the sarcastic humor and the drama of the suspense keeps your attention. Highly recommend for an evening of entertainment!! Looking forward to season three."
4,An early bossa nova diva,"Maysa Matarozzo was one of the most famous female vocalists in Brazil during the 1950s; during the bossa nova era she became the conduit for pianist Roberto Menescal's explorations of the new style, and was an important early interpreter of Antonio Carlos Jobim's work. Personally, I've never been a fan of Maysa's vocals -- she strikes me as too overwrought and slushy, and generally I don't care for her arrangements. That being said, this 2-CD set is one of the best Maysa retrospectives of her work that I've heard. It's well-programmed and engaging, covering a wide swath of her career, from 1960 to her death in the 1970s, giving a pretty complete picture of her style and inclinations. If you want to check Maysa out, this is where I'd recommend you start."
5,"A ""birthday"" gift to buy for someone!","Although the movie is slow moving, the plot is great and keeps your attention. Claire Danes plays the daughter of a man who still ""believes"" his deacesed wife (Jillian) is still alive. He ""talks"" to his dead wife every night on the beach, believing his hallucinations are real, creating emotional troubles for his daughter. That sums up 95% of the movie, so in respect for Amazon, i will not give away any more. But i will tell you it is very emotional and warm-hearted. So buy this movie for any ""birthday"" occasion, and celebrate!"
5,Very Touching,"I watched this movie simply because I love Claire Danes, and was rather suprised by how moved I was by this movie. Claire Danes is WONDERFUL, and the story is very moving and believable. I've seen this movie 3 times and I recommend it to anyone who's looking for a sad, moving family drama."
3,Melodramatic.,"To Gillian on Her 37th Birthday is a very wishy-washy kind of film. Peter Gallagher is wrongly cast as the grieving husband. Michelle Pfeiffer is barely in this film since she plays a ghost but she is a flawless and stunning actress - it doesn't hurt that her husband, David E. Kelley wrote the script. Claire Danes is wonderful as well, she is good at playing a brooding teen. Good flick but feels too soap opera for me."
3,Great Subject - Medeocre Exicution,"If you don't analyze this movie, it's great. But if you do, you realize that it's not more than a series of emotional triggers. It is one of my favorite movies because I can relate to some of the subject matter, but if you do analyze it, you can quickly see that the reason the story doesn't flow very well is because they were trying to hard to strike such a wide variety of emotional chords, the story-telling suffered and became shallow.If you want to see a good emotional drama that will have some appeal to just about everyone, this is the movie for you. If you are going to analize it, you'll be dissapointed.It's a great story and has a great cast, but something is missing. That said, if you just want some emotional heroin, watch this movie."
2,"Great to build, lousy to play with","My son and I had a great time building this beautiful ship, but shame on Lego for not putting a dislaimer on the box, ""Not for Play, Only for Show!"" You can't breath on this thing without the hull falling apart. You expect small pieces to fall off, but the backbone structure?. I will start tomorrow on some modifications (glue anyone) to make this thing an actual toy for a 7 year old with a great imagination. By the way, whatever happened to making your own designs with generic bricks?"
5,Very nice stand for the price!,I was leery of ordering this stand because of some of the poor reviews. I took a chance and I'm glad I did. It's very nice. It's sturdy and well made. For the price it was a very good deal.
3,Not the best A&P book,This book has a lot of vague points and skims over a lot of important facts and functions - the only reason my school switched to this book was because there was one tiny flaw in the nervous system chapter of the prior book.But buy it on amazon because the bookstore will overprice it (they wanted $195 at my school for JUST the book and that was used - not including lab manual).
4,Great book,"This was my first exposure to Beryl Bainbridge; a friend reccommended another of her books to me, and this was the first one I could find in the library, so I picked it up. I've read a few more since then, and while this isn't her best book, it is still a solid read, moving, disturbing, and darkly comic by turns. There's not a whole lot of plot, but there is a story that pulls you along, and the characters are sketched out brilliantly. I can't remember the last time I read something that was quite this disturbing without ever being blatantly violent or horrorific; it's more about the evils people do to themselves and others in the real world than anything. I wouldn't necessarily suggest starting with this book if you're new to the author; but then, I did, and I'm a huge fan. Definitely worth a look."
5,A Must Read!!!,"This marvelous book kept me up all night! Page after page strikes the reader with both keen insight and poetic elegance into the life and times of Jesus Christ. Mr. Kauffman has done a great job portraying the various people that Jesus may have come in contact with and how these encounters forever changed their lives. This is a must read book for anyone between the ages of 13 and 113 who is interested in learning more about the pivotal force behind Christianity. Thank you, Mr. Kauffman, for providing us with this delightful masterpiece. I strongly recommend this book!"
3,Okay hose plug set,The item is as described and shipped within the time promised.What it is: a series of rubber/silicon plugs to plug-up vacuum or fuel lines.These do exactly as described. It would be nice if they also had sizes marked for sizing hoses.It's a bit over-priced for what it is.
2,"Great sound, transformer is a shame!!","I bought this product in a Dutyfree shop. When I got back home, i was surprised about the size of the transformer. Besides being bulky, it was only for 110-120 Volt. WHAT!!!. I have an old HI-MD that cdomes with a transformer, it is small an multivolt from 100-240V. I thought this ""multivolt"" was an standard nowadays, but not for JBL I guess. I had to by a second transformer to use back home, since we have here 220V.Another thing, I have a 4GB Ipod NANO first gen, and the remote doesn`t work(Has never worked for me). Went to the MAC store here, and the guy told me the batteries could be failing (remote ones). Strange for a new product.Summary: The sound is the only plus, the rest is awfull"
3,JBL OnStage II,"I was very impressed with the sound quality of this product. I've only owned it since the end of July and used it a few times. Last week, I put it on only to find I couldn't control the volume--nothing works....I'm currently in contact with JBL to see about fixing/replacing the product."
5,Current and Topical,"This books deals with today's issues as if were written only yesterday. Rabbi Kahane's incisive articles are as true today as ever.In fact, the articles in this book were written by Rabbi Kahane between 1961 and 1990, but if their dates would not have been given, I would have thought that he wrote them only last week.He insisted that Jews must be proud of being Jewish. This is the basis of his philosophy, whether he applies it to determining government policy or to conducting one's private life.This book must be read - it is a breath of fresh air!"
3,Great Old Fashion Drying Rack.,"The rack came very, very well packaged but it is built of pencil thin wooden dowels. Perhaps since I am over 80 years and from the Pacific Northwest, I am used to sturdier wooden household products that can really take the general wear and tear of use over the years.Mary Ellen McFadden"
3,"A little slow-moving, but many wonderful moments!!","I actually liked this movie a lot overall, but other people that were watching it with me felt that it was very slow-moving. It is definitely worth watching, with wonderful moments of beautiful film-making. Sometimes it is very entertaining, but I do agree with my friends that there are too many passages in the movie that ""drift along"". It is not a movie I would necessarily watch again and again, but I would still recommend it to anyone to watch at least once! (That is, if you are not an impatient person...)"
5,Was this book written about me?,Oh my I can certainly relate to this person. This entire story practically. I am a single mother who has always struggled and felt alone. The story was so real and so down to earth and I thought it was written about me. The only downside is that it really needs some better editing. But what a story. I had a good cry in the end.
3,I Must Be Used To It...,"...because it didn't scare me. But I do agree that Dumplings IS extreme and that is the one that made me flinch the most. The gross out factor is very high. Do NOT eat, especially not oriental dumplings or potstickers while you are watching this.Cut: Well it was ok. I liked the plot. I am surprised how many people don't get the ending when I understand what was going on in this one perfectly. It's very linear.Box: Getting faaaaar away from linear here. It is the most beautifully shot, but it's also the hardest to understand. I had to read spoiler reviews to actually get it."
4,Very sturdy,Well made. Not worries about wet jeans or towels being too heavy. Not as big as you might think. Pleased overall.
4,good book,"the book is okay, though the maps are not enough, there are still wonderful contents about world history. the price is reasonable."
3,"Not the original recording of ""Run For Home""","This is not to say Lindisfarne aren't talented, or that this CD isn't worthy. Bought ""The Other Side Of..."" to get ""Run For Home"" a minor US hit single in the late 70's, but discovered it was a studio remake, not the original version."
1,:(,"I bought this phone thinking it was gonna be great for the price, and yes I bought it new. When the phone arrived I activated it trough Verizon. The Activation worked but the phone didn't, every time I would try to make a call I would get a message ""Call Failed"". Don't waste your money."
1,Broke in four months,"I ordered this phone as a temporary replacement until I switched carriers but now I've had to find another temporary replacement as this phone completely broke within four months time. During that time period the phone would occasionally shut down for no reason and then have to boot up again. But it was not frequent so it was something I could live with. UNTIL one day it decided to reboot but never got started again. I cannot turn the phone on ... or off. When the battery is on, it is in a constant mode of trying to reboot. White screen with an hour glass. Black screen. Again. And again. It is so bad that Verizon cannot even retrieve my contacts. Terrible product. Do not purchase!"
3,Will it work with T-mobile?,My T-mobile phone is broken. Can anyone let me know will this phone work with my current T-mobile sim. Thanks.
1,Blackberry Review,"When I received the blackberry and took it to verizon to activate, the man had told me it had been a great phone. However, the internet was not accessible for me to check my email, and one of the buttons on the phone did not work. I was disappointed."
4,Love it!!,"This is a great album from start to finish. I love bands like Nightwish, Xandria, Lullacry, and Lunatica. This band ranks up there with the best of the female fronted bands. Not a throwaway song on this disc!!! You won't regreat buying this!!"
3,SINS OF THE WRITER,"Rina and Peter Decker are back and continue to resemble the Lockhorns in the amount of squabbles they have. This time, Rina gives birth to their daughter, but in doing so, complications force a hysterectomy on her. Decker gets involved in the kidnapping of an newborn infant who is sharing the nursery with his new daughter. Cindy Decker is along with them this time, and decides to play detective, against her father's stern and chauvinistic wishes. Marge Dunn continues her slide into more adamant cynicism, and that's just for starters.While this one is not one of Kellerman's best, it maintains some interest due to the complexity of the mystery and the discovery of key facts. The character of Tandy stretches the imagination a bit, and her fate at the end, along with nurse Marie Bellson is not one of comfort or resolution.Still, I find myself initrigued with the series and even with their faults, Rina and Pete are a strong couple."
2,tedious and frustrating,"I found this book to be very disappointing.Too much dialogue and emotion...in the hospital waiting room especially. I can't believe the number of hours Cindy and Peter spent at the hospital. Also, the under-staffed nursery...(one of four nurseries) was too unrealistic to believe. The nurseries should have been consolidated...to match the number of nurses available.Unrealistic characters...especially Tandy. The word 'caring' is used to describe the motivation of nurses in excess. Makes you really wonder about the nursing profession...and their sanity.The baby's parents were stereotyped latino teenagers.I was frustrated starting at page one....all the way until the end."
4,about the movie the heart of me.......,The storoy is basically about one of the actress Dinah whom got pregnant after sex with the actress's husband(Maldeleine) whom later try to tie down Maldeleine's husband by messing with their marriage. I am notgoing to say anything more to the story to make the movie boring to watch. There are two sex scenes inside and also for those whom are interested to watch this genre of movie. I watch this at Singapore theatre.
5,Building Great Sheds,Great book. Beautiful pictures & detailed plans. It will be hard to decide which one to build.
3,WHY rated R?,THe people who rate movies always give independent films higher ratings to discourage them from competing with Studio films. There was no nudity or extreme violence so why was this rated R?
5,Great for Carolla fans,This movie is funny if you listen to Adam. You will understand the inside jokes that he talks about in his show. I wouldn't suggest that you buy this if you don't really know Adam.
5,always a great movie,This movie delivers laughs and a complete story in a neat little package. I couldn't find anything to complain about if I tried and it's refreshing to see a movie that is truly appropriate for the whole family (despite the unfounded R rating).
5,LOVE IT!!,I have become a fan of Adam Carolla - specifically in his radio days after taking over after Howard. This movie is hysterical and is a great flick. Its classic Adam!
4,Great story and great film,Carolla has dialed in the 'everyman' vibe in his script/film. Any guy who is from humble roots will appreciatehow Adam Carolla slogs his way through life.
5,Surprisingly Good,"I'm a big fan of the Aceman and his podcast network. I wasn't sure what to expect from his own movie. It was even better than I was expecting, and a great price as well. Definitely recommended."
3,Not as Funny as Carolla and Bill Simmons Think,"Wasn't terrible, but I expected more after hearing Adam Corolla and Bill Simmons hype it endlessly. It's pretty slow, predictable, and lacks any real humor. Other than that...oh well, could be worse."
2,Not as good as advertised,"Adam Corolla really hyped this movie during his appearance on the Bill Simmons podcast on ESPN.com. I also see that many reviewers seem to have loved this movie. But I don't really get it. I'm a big Corolla fan and some of his subtle/dry humour is hilarous during this movie, but overall this is a below-average (and unoriginal) Hollywood filem."
2,Don't believe the hype!,"I must admit, I fell for the hype. I liked Adam on Loveline and The Man Show, but his morning radio show is pretty lame, unless you like meandering drivel. I only listen during Mark and Brian commercials(and if Kevin and Bean also are at commercial). I decided to give the movie a try after repeatedly hearing him pat himself on the back about how good it was and how it didn't get any bad reviews. Well, I was highly disappointed to say the least. If you like predictable movies and bad acting, you'll love this movie! The only redeeming quality(and thus a second star for my review) is the leading lady, played by Heather Juergensen. She is very charming, but unfortunately, couldn't save the movie on her own. Please don't waste your time/money on this film, if only to dissuade Adam from acting in the future! He was on Tim Conway Jr's radio show again last night, and said all of the reviews on Amazon were glowing- he must not have checked recently!"
1,R U Kidding?,"Sorry, just not worth buying or renting. Wait for it on TV as there are so much more movies out there that is better than this."
1,"Looks good, doesn't go very well","The bike makes it about a foot across the floor before falling over. It never makes it up the ramp. My five year old is very frustrated by this toy. Dad can't make it work either. skip it, it's a waste of plastic."
3,"Great Desdemona, [Junky] Iago","The movie is pretty good except for the parts when Iago talks directly to the camera. That is so annerving/annoying! It totally distracts from the play. Desdemona was superiorly played in this movie though, so it's worth a look. What can I say about Othello. He's Laurence Fishburne. Of course he's good. ;)"
3,Laurence Fishburne's talent is wasted,"Poor Laurence Fishburne. I felt so sorry for him watching this movie because he gives a passionate and multi-dimensional performance as Othello and yet, no one else in the cast matches or even comes close to his level of talent.As the cover photo suggests, this is a more sexualized version of Shakespeare's tragedy, which doesn't make it bad, but definitely steals the focus from the other emotions that fuel the story. All of Othello's feelings were intense, not just those he had for Desdemona, and this fact is overlooked by the emphasis on his sexuality. Kenneth Braunagh is such a bad Iago that I actually found myself laughing at him. As for Irene Jacob's performance, it is really not worth mentioning here. She is pretty and exotic but she gives no depth to the wounded character of Desdemona. I truly wish that this movie could be redone by a different director with a different supporting cast, because it is a fascinating idea that just falls flat."
3,Very weak...,"Well not the whole thing...I just want to know why the ending was changed! It's very silly they did that, and I'm surprised that Branagh allowed it! He was great as Iago, as was Fishburn as Othello, but the ending just made me mad. If not for it, I would have given it at least 4 stars. Too many of the lines were cut to warrant 5 stars."
4,"See it, even if you don't like Shakespeare!","I must admit that Othello is my favourite Shakespeare play. It's shocking and cunning and you can't stop watching it, even when it gets more and more tragic.I have to study it for my A Levels and it makes the book so much easier because it puts everything in context.Admittedly Laurence Fishburne is a fantastic Othello but in some parts he seems to be reading a line rather than saying it naturally and Irene Jacobs' Desdemona is brilliant, her facial expressions completely natural.However, my favourite character was of course Iago. Kenneth Branagh had Iago's character down perfectly and he was of course perfect in his lines and pronunciation.Overall, a great film. Even if you don't like Shakespeare, watch it. I didn't liek Shakespeare before I saw this and now I really like his work."
2,zatoichi,"I will write the same comment on each one that I purchased for my parents. Although the video quality was good, through generations of copying the audio was lousy. My parents, who are fluent in Japanese, needed to read the English subtitles to understand what was being said. Check the quality before keeping the item."
1,Not much content,"By reading the books description, it seemed to be exactly what I needed. However, it fails to deliver much of what was expected. The author provides very little explanation into any theory and says ""just try out the software and see for yourself."" The author says himself many times, ""the source code it way clearer than anything I can explain."" There is practically no source code in the book itself, just on the CD. And the author does not explain any of it. Overall, I was very unsatisfied with the book. After reading it I felt I had no better understanding of the subject than before I bought the book. The author relies on his example program in the CD for you to figure out everything. If I wanted to do that, I'd download an example program from the internet with source code."
3,"Good content, Bad writing skills","Beginners in DSP beware, this book is not for you. The book lacks continuity and expressiveness, puts me to sleep within minutes of opening it :-)But there is lot of content and the experienced DSP guy can use this as a reference book.But this book does not serve as a text book or a good tutorial for any class of people, only as a reference book."
1,DO NOT GET IT,"I was so happy to get the Air Earl but when i got it the wing was snapped in half and the foam wheels did not even roll. And that was the least of the problems. The controler did not have a spring for at least 3 battery slots. So i could not even put the batteries in. This is just a warning, DO NOT GET THIS PLANE THEY ARE CARELESS ABOUT PACKING AND SHIPPING. DO NOT GET"
1,Junk,This airplane would not fly at all. Tried several ways to fly the airplane in accordance with the instruction and still would not fly. The wings feel apart after couple of crash landing. This was a waste of my money and a waste of my time. I should have not purchased this product.
1,Absolute Trash,"I have been taken again. I will not buy another cheap model plane. This thing is complete Junck!! Substandard foam used in the construction breaks easily. patch it with tape, and it may last one more flight, but the screws holding the wing are the first thing to go. Tail stabilizer will break from wind. and forget flying if there is even the slightest breeze flowing. it will invert the plane and you're going for a nose dive straight to the ground. Junk, junk, junk. i wish i has saved my money for something more stable and durable."
2,Cheap foam junk,I got this as a easy plane to learn to fly -but every time I fly it I have to glue it back together- I did have a few good flights but if you get it fly in no wind only and be ready to repair it offen. Taterbug39
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF JUNK,Don't buy this piece of junk it has 5 meters range only i contact Customer Care they we will contact item manufacturer from 16 feb until now 28 feb no replay
1,Didn't Fly,"The plane never flew.... It was very bad decision, it was my worst purchase ever made, be careful if you want to buy this"
1,The Kindle Edition is not Umberto Eco,"There seems to be a hiccup in the Kindle Store's database. This book is a collection of essays on literature put together by a United States professor of literature. It is not, as implied, a translation of the lectures by Umberto Eco."
3,Old School Sups!,"Definatly not the Superman from the well liked WB series! These are beautifully restored, however, the sound isn't DVD quality. I love the fact that all the classic episodes are on one DVD! These are a piece of not only comic, but film history too! I suggest this piece to own for any Superman fan. Just remember how old these cartoons are before you judge their quality."
4,Classis Superman in Classic presentation,"(...) This presentation is not in ""pan and scan"" because most movies were not shot in widescreen until the 50's. This was a move to compete with TV. Also, most movies (if not all, but don't quote me) were made in mono audio. Stereo was not developed until later, and certainly wasn't put into use for an animated short. (...) I think an appreciation of the era in which these were created is in order before the presentation is criticized.This is the real deal, and animation fans, Superman fans and film aficionados alike should enjoy the ASTOUNDING work done by the Fleischers at the time. These shorts are still considered to be a benchmark for other animators (ie Bruce Timm) to stand up to."
1,Superman w/Ads,"I have the Mr. Bongo SD Edition of these cartoons - pretty bad; so I was really looking forward to a Blu-Ray edition. What arrived yesterday is a 2-disk advertisement for some ""lifestyle company"" in Colorado. And the Blu-ray transfer is terrible - over-saturated, full of digital artifacts, and generally not at all reliable.I'm returning it today. Maybe in another few years some responsible production company will try releasing a decent BD edition."
4,No One Goes Solo,"This movie is primarily about the relationship between the weary journalist and the homeless artist, and Downey and Foxx give great performances. It sensitively deals with issues of charity and friendship in ways that challenge conventional ideals, and I liked the fact that in the end, Downey's character seems content to stop playing the role of ""rescuer"" and instead lets events play out to their natural conclusion. In fact, Foxx's character, for all the mental distress he faces, seems more grounded at times than Downey's character, and you might wonder whether the soloist refers to the cello virtuoso or the journalist who seems to learn what it means to be a friend rather than going solo through life. In that respect, it's a show that operates effectively on more than a superficial level.Now if they could just have spent a little more time coaching Foxx on his fake cello-playing skills...alas."
4,nice,This item was shipped and received promptly. The item was as described and function properly. Very satisfied with the item.
2,"2.5 Good Idea, But Not A Good Movie","I liked the idea of the talented homeless musician who is found and has his passion for music renewed. However, this movie jumps back and forth. It goes back to when Foxx's character was young, bouncing back from times and places, to current time. The relationship with Downey's ex-wife seemed pointless to the movie. The scene where Foxx and Downey are in the DIsney Theater listening to the music, became a 70's style acid trip with colored lights to the music (huh???). How bout just focusing on the character???!I found the movie boring at times. Its no wonder it didn't do well at the theaters.The special features of the actual characters on the DVD was more interesting than the movie. BAsed on Foxx's portrayl of the character and watching the actual man on the special features, it looks to me like Foxx over did it."
4,Loved It!!,"The Soloist is based on the book by Steve Lopez, and directed by Joe Wright. This movie is based on the true accounts of LA journalist Steve Lopez.While searching for his next story, Lopez, played by Robert Downey Jr., stumbles across a Julliard trained musician who is also homeless and suffers from mental illness. The Soloist took me on a journey that I was unprepared to take, though I feel I am better for having taken it. This movie was moving and poignant. The Soloist allows you to take a hard-nosed look at homelessness and mental illness in America, and at the importance of friendships in our lives. More pointedly, The Soloist allows you to reassess your views on all three.I highly recommend this movie but, be prepared to be positively touched on an emotional and mental level. Jamie Foxx gives a riveting performance as Nathaniel Ayers and Downey's portrayal of Lopez is spot on! This movie delivered more than I ever expected. I will watch it again and again.WebbWeaver Reviews"
3,"""I am Sam"" with a cello","3.5 stars. Foxx gives an impressive performance in what is a somewhat slow movie. Much like ""I am Sam,"" it's about a professional who finds existential clarity through his interactions with mentally ill homeless person. It presents a powerful picture of the heavy and neglected burden of mental health in a society that sees the mentally ill as an inconvenience. Not a great movie but worth watching if you have the opportunity.Not bad but not recommended."
1,Rudimentary,This book is pretty basic and not worth the money. Lucier must be trying to make money on the book and not on in real estate. A real disappointment.
5,Great product,Worked great as described....installation took about 3 hours with the help of a friend.
1,never again,I've used both the spray and perfume with same results/there's really not a good scent and it disappears quickly/good perfume should last for hours-not this one/Maybe this is really old....will never buy perfume over internet again.
5,A very special recording of a great artist and musical era.,Received my Ride With Bob CD in today's mail and my feet haven't stopped tapping since. It's just a very special collection of artists and music resulting in a most fitting tribute to this great artist. I'm ready to jump in my car and drive the 400-500 miles between gigs. I wish I could!!!! It's the best!
4,What is Scott talkingabout?,"I happen to like this CD, but i don't like Scott's attitude! Tim McGraw is a talented singer and will keep selling CD's so he'd better get used to it. If he doesn't lik it, he doesn't have to listen to it. For any of you out there, if you've heard Tim's mewest CD, A Place In the Sun, I'm sure you agree with me that it is really good. I hope to hear more from Tim in the future. And I think Scott needs to shove his opinion where the sun don't shine!"
5,He really knows what hes talking about,Even now I listen to this CD and it was obvious that he would become a big star. His songs aren't fake they come from his heart. Whether they're fast and fun or slow and meaningful they're all true. Tim Mcgraw is a wonderful artist and I see him as staying around a long time.
1,Regrettable !,"Not worth a long review really.Except for the title ans its cover the book's empty. Nothing much on sniping, even less on the Wehrmacht's snipers and thit is outrageous.Poor read, I was utterly disappointed by this book.Nice cover, exciting and rare topic. Whilst the narration is poor, I haven't learnt a thing, least of all on German sniping in WW II. Shouldn't it be about sniping, German sniping, German sniping in WW II by one of its herald or did I miss the object of the book ?Never once did I find a captivating part and found it difficult to finish.A waste, simply a waste of time. Comment ends."
4,Sniper on the Eastern Front,"A very informative review, from an unusual point of view!Well written in well sculpted English .Gives one insight into the thought processes of the opposition and a view of the Big Russian Beat!"
4,Sniper on the Eastern Front,"Very good book, I highly recommend for military buffs. A butural reality of what actually happened from the enemy's stantpoint of veiw."
2,I wish I could believe,"It is a pity that a good historian like Anthony Beevor had not access to the original interviews as a better book would have resulted. The story is good (although other reviewers question its originality) but the way it is written is overblown and sloppy.I have finished this book. This is a confection, a lie. It does seems to be a collection of horror stories from the Eastern Front. Wish I could de-rate this book further. Do not waste you money on this book."
5,"Ostfront ""Natural Born Killer""","This is the best, and only memoir in English, of a German sniper on the Eastern Front. Unlike the questionable boastings of Soviet snipers, Sepp Allerberger's acount reads true and is delivered in a matter of fact ""kill them before they can kill me"" manner. He takes no pleasure in what he did, but his ""natural born killer"" instincts shine through. The Eastern Front was not for the weak and he was among the strongest of the strong. Highest recommendation!"
3,Film noir staple,"Typical film noir piece. Not as gripping as Maltese Falcon or Double Indeminity, but with many of the same cinematic styles.Gary Oldman does a fine job as the crooked cop and ultimate victim. Lena Olin overplays the mad yet engaging seductress, and Juliette Lewis shows another typically dull performance.Good solid film noir."
5,"Indeed, an excellent reference.",An on hand reference for all the immediate details required by Interior Designers and Architects. Quite often a lot of time is wasted searching in numerous texts for information. The Architect's Data has it all-between the covers. User friendly and well illustrated.
1,bad.no goof for celler.,"I think this is just the medium size, and description, the brand is damaged, so I just feel the brand is a large driftwood is not, driftwood and pictures are not the same, I have received 's just not the shape of the piece"
4,monk #1,my husband is a monk fan and can't wait to get seasons 7 & 8. he watches monk all the time and enjoys the fact that he can watch it any time he wants.
1,Monk the Obsessive Compulsive Collection,"I am giving this item one star because of the price from Amazon. Target has sesions one - five for $19.99 each. That would make seasons one - four $80.00. Why would anyone pay over $100.00 for the same seasons. Amazon you are extremely overpriced on your Monk DVD's. Please consider a price decrease!!! I love Monk, however I will not pay the asking price at Amazon. I made my purchase of Monk at Target."
3,What is an experimental novel?,"This apparently. This is a novel as obsessed withbreaking the rules of story telling, as its charactersare obsessed with breaking the rules of Christianity.Lots of religious symbolism, bizarre sequences, wordyprose and often offensive material. Not necessarilysacrilegious as its suggested, but certainly a bookthat challenges beliefs. There are some moments inthe book so emotional and well-written...and thenthere are other moments of just plain madness, thatseem to belong to a different story altogether.Experimental stuff, that I wouldn't call the best ofthe year, (I usually read romance novels) but hard toforget. Also I should advise that the book doescontain strong language and scenes of sexuality thatwill offend some. Love it or leave it variety."
4,"Superior stories, inferior format","These are cartoons for grownups as well as kids. They're weird, they're fun, they're smart, and our hero Rocko is such a decent guy.I've given Rocko's ""Machine Madness"" collection 4, rather than 5 stars not because the stories are lacking - they're all wonderful - but for corn's sake, why is this still only available on VHS?I love Rocko and his friends! Why are they not available on DVD? Why oh why?"
5,Rocco Is The Best,I loved rocco until they stopped playing it on nick?!This video is great! Especially the succo matic one . the one with the vacume cleaner! If you are a rocco lover this video is definetly worth buying
5,This is a great book!,"The recipes are delicious, healthy and easy to make. I bought this book almost 10 years ago and still make many of the recipes on a regular basis."
5,Insight into a life of a great war photographer...,"Insight into a life of a great war photographer, who has so many great stories to tell. I first bought the book in paperback edition, now I added it to my ebook collection."
5,You go A&E!!,"Hornblower and Co are trapped in port under a siege by a Spanish fire ship(huge mortor-like vessles). In a strange twist of fate this is also the time for Hornblower to become an actual Lt, and not just an acting one.A&E does it agian, if you like Richard Sharpe you will like this DVD."
5,Horatio Hornblower Rules!,"I had never read any of the Hornblower series before I saw these films but I have since and enjoyed every single book. Although the films do not follow the books too closely, they are even better. They are inspired and the actors seem as if the books were written just for their characterizations. Ioan Gruffudd is perfect as Hornblower and I think will be one of our great actors of the future. If you think you won't enjoy seafaring adventures such as these, you may be suprised to find yourself thoroughly engrossed in these films."
2,Lacks the punch and excitement of the Hornblower series.,"As a long-time Hornblower fan, I was very excited at the prospect of the A&E Hornblower series (especially after the exceptional A&E Pride and Prejudice), but I was very disappointed by this series.If you have read any of the Hornblower novels, you know they are fast paced and wonderfully exciting tales of war at sea. These films were anything but- what is a 20 page story in the book is drawn out to a boring 2 hours. They lack the excitement and action which makes the Hornblower series great. What a shame!"
5,it became a family ritual to watch it,"Not expecting to enjoy it I watched it critically at first , but i loved it . Having seen the first tape , i was thankful that we had purchased the set because it is something you cannot get enough of . I only wish there were more .It shows clearly the times and the lives on board ships in those naval battles of long ago , they were real poeple with troubles of their own not just participants in old wars . Each actor in this series held up their part and character portrayals were excellent ,especially by Ioan Gruffudd as Hornblower , and Robert Lindsay as Captain Pellew .They brought out the essence of each character in all the subtleties of tone and varied expressions ,always leaving one feeling that there was much more below the surface .The scenes were also well put together ,with good juxtaposition in parts ,altogether i believe it to be well directed and executed ."
4,Best cd ever,"The 1st song Boogie Woogie No. 5,Is about collecting stuff thatyou put around your belt(1st best song)!Voilet,is the song about a person! Then theres Shut Your mouth,Honey!Cosmic Wonder is a complicated song!The next one is also very hard to understand!Su-I-Su-I is the 3rd best song!Sui Sui is likeSu-I-Su-I!Swimming Pool is a summer song!Green Apple is a boringsong!The next one is a relaxing song!Into the Beach is a rockinsong!Puffy's Rule (2nd best song)!December expresses the birds and everything else in december!Love so pure (love song)!Wild Girls on Circuit(wild,crazy,girly song)!"
5,great idea,"Great idea with this rubber case for cell abusers like me. Thanks.I did have to take off the shell of my phone for it to work ( to clip on securely) and wasn't especting that, but it's cool and I've tested it daily. I'm a cell abuser. It's a very dense rubber. Almost just feels like soft plastic. That seems to be doing the job.Would like to see more choices for designs and colors for changing it up sometime. No complaints ."
2,it is what it is,sale went smoothly. For the price is ok but it is prone to come off the phone to easily. I guess you get what you pay for
3,One Book Two Covers,"This book is a useful and practical guide, provided you do not already have Race Training by Rick White. Race Training is page for page (except the cover) identical with Sailing Drills. Literally, even the page numbering is the same. Save your money and buy one."
1,sailing drills review,Pretty basic kind of book with a lot of well known drills collected under one cover
2,Everything learning German Book,Looking for a book to help me learn to speak and understand German. As I read thru the first few pages I was totally confused. Nothing to actually help me to learn to speak German. I made it thru the lst 30 or so pages and quit. Not what I was looking for
5,"The Everything Learning German Book: Speak, write, and understand...",This book is so helpful that the Prof. for the night course referenced and recommended using it so as to get a grip on the basic grammar used in speaking.
4,"good, but buy audio lessons as well","I decided to learn German as a third language, and this is an excellent starter book. However, I do have a problem with The Everything Learning German Book: the lack of guidance with pronunciation. After the first few chapters, the book stops providing the way to pronounce words and phrases. I recommend buying CDs in conjunction with this book. Otherwise, the exercises are helpful and the book is interesting."
1,Interesting but not Relevant Information,"I just finished taking the Custodian I and II exams in Central New York ( March, 2008 ) - 90 questions. This book was of no help. Although the information is interesting and, maybe, useful to a custodian - it didn't help with the questions that were on the New York State exams. It was just a tad better than the ""School Custodian"" book that dwelled on coal-fired boilers and asbestos covered pipes."
5,WOW BEAUTIFUL TOY!,I got this for my oldest daughter because I had bought a ringtailed FIESTA brand lemur at the store at the zoo for my youngest daughter. We looked through 300 pages of toys and Marina picked this out. VERY SOFT VERY PRETTY ANIMAL! WOW! Really exotic. The fur is gorgeous colors and the eyes are mesmerizing golden pools of light! I am thoroughly impressed with the quality. Marina LOVES her red ruffed lemur! Loves it!
1,The SECOND worst book I ever finished.,"I read it years ago, when it first came out, and was grateful I got it at the library.This book was the beginning of the end for this flamboyant, colorful talk show host."
2,Who Better To Write About Ghosts Than A Ghostwriter?,"Bob Larson might be the ""author"" of this book for copyright purposes, but that's about it. Dead Air was, in effect, the scandal that brought him down.Protagonist Wes Bryant IS Bob Larson -- at least as he would like the world to see him. Once you understand that fact, you get a frightening look into what passes for the man's soul."
2,Dead Air,"Wes Bryant is a talk show host in the small town of Clarion, Indiana. One day, a young girl named Jennifer calls his talk show and says she's held captive by some evil people. Wes decide to try to find her and uncovers a sinister secret society engaging in satanic ritual abuse.Satanic ritual abuse was a popular moral panic in the 1980s and radio evangelist Bob Larson seems to be a self-proclaimed expert on the subject. This novel (ghost written by one of his staff) takes satanic rutial abuse very seriously. The book is a quick read and kept my interest but the whole story felt very silly and impossible to take seriously. The heroes often behaved very irrationally, which is always annoying. I also don't think I've ever seen so many typos in a book before. Read it only if you like me occasionally like to read really bad over-the-top Christian fiction. If I were to disregard all its flaws it would've got 3 stars for entertainment value."
1,Surreal,"Even if this were fiction, this book felt disjointed and surreal. I had actually hoped to learn more about ""generation 9/11"" .. and instead read the private journal of Tom Reissmann. While I appreciate the writing style, I think the title is misleading. Did not enjoy this book."
5,UnPlugged,"The 9/11 attacks do not define a generation, but rather provoke another painful wake up call that no one lives in isolation but chooses daily to perpetuate or not - economic, social, and ecological inequity. Thomas Reissmann cleverly strings seemingly disparate ideas into a story of not only his life after 9/11, but of a global generation. Accept the red pill if you dare; unplug and witness the matrix, the collective unconscious, and old archetpyes of power, resistance, and love resurfacing through a web of digital imagery - choose to accept responsibility and enjoy."
2,"much worse than ""the richest man""","i agree with the other reviewers. this is the worst ""thievery corporation"" cd i've heard. buy ""the richest man"" by the same group and listen to the tracks ""facing east"", ""the outernationalist"" and ""omid"". or try the cut ""originality"" on thievery corporation's ""versions"" cd. much better than this collection of meandering drivel (abductions and reconstructions) where there is no real atmosphere, no groove, and only bad vocals.or better yet, try the band ""crystal method"" (takes more chances and is very cool as background electronic groove music). crystal method is more for listening to inside, however the best of thievery corporation is also great music for firedancers (like by the ocean in big sur)."
4,very good thievery mix - must have for any downtempo fan!!,"Thievery corp. has really made a name for themselves with their lines of cd's that are truly a wonderful journey in downtempo grooves everytime one sits down to listen to them. These guys bring in influences from all over the world for their music and the result is a wonderful mix perfect for the late night cocktail and a night by the fireplace with a few good friends. Notable tracks on this cd:kc dopplerporno 3003hijackave mariadefencelessthis strange effectsexelavatormuzicthe others aren't bad, but not for me. i pick these for their wonderful quality and mysterious sound. well worth a buy!"
1,"unreadable, disjointed, terrible","While backstory is interesting this book takes it to such extremes as to make the book unreadable. The tanks were coming which reminded Private Smith about a movie he saw in his home town in Ohio, where his friend Bill lived, and Bill once had a cat that got stuck in a tree, an elm tree..... Please, what about the tank battle?I'm a huge fan of WWII books but this one is awful."
5,Great story told well.,"This book is a bit slow getting started, but becomes a real page-turner in no time. A great example of what made this country's finest generation so great. An absolute must-have for any WWII buff. This book is on the ""top shelf"" of my collection, and I have let many friends read it. Highly recommended."
3,Bouck's Boys,"This is a great story, a story that has long been ignored by many. It is refreshing to see men who just thought that they were doing their job be get the recognition they deserve. And for that I salute Kershaw.However, I found the writing of the book to spend too much time focusing on characters like Peiper and Abe Baum who really had nothing to do with Lyle Bouck and his men. While I understand that they were roundaboutly connected, I still felt that the book should have focused more on Bouck and his men, rather than on peripherary characters. I also found several misspellings and inconsistencies with the book. That was more frustrating than anything else.Overall, I feel that this is a good book and an easy quick read. It truly does shed light on a subject that needs to be examined. I just wish Kershaw did a better job."
5,Philadelphia area records from the late 1600's thru late 1800's,"Large book that would be cumbersome if in hardback. Heavy enough in paperback. Print is typewriter letters but clearly and solidly set on the page.I took this volume to bed to read but laid it on the bed for support while reading.It has a general history of the Philadelphia Yearly Meeting, a page of abbreviations, and a little history of each of the earliest four monthly meetings (Salem NJ, Burlington NJ, Philadelphia PA, Falls-Fallsington,Bucks Co. PA), their records, and where those records are kept.There is a 135 page family name index with variations of spellings grouped together before all the page numbers are given.Notice is made of any individuals within a family group entry of a different name.I had great fun reading it cover to cover. 1126 pages including index."
4,very clean vinyl,"Plays great, however the mixer should have lowered the high end, especially on the acoustic guitar. Still overall a great pressing of one of my favorite albums."
5,Arguably the best (and perhaps the only) American progressive rock band...,"Kansas is an anomaly in American rock. They are probably the only truly progressive rock band in American history, and a damn good one. They can stand with any of the great British progressive bands (and I love progressive rock). This album is definitely the one I dig the most. While Song for America and Point of No Return are excellent too, this one is the most consistent with not one bad track in the whole album. My 2 favorite songs are Miracles Out of Nowhere and Magnum Opus. I love the intricacy of both of them, especially the latter. From their debut through Monolith, they were putting out great album after great album. Their arrangements and songwriting was some of the best American rock ever produced. It's a shame that they splintered in the 1980's, and ended up in so many different incarnations. But we still have their 70's output to hold onto..."
3,Confusing,"I will try some of the ideas in the book, but like so many golf instruction books, it's just someone else's opinion of how it should be done.. Makes a lot of since, but so does other ideas."
1,Back injury waiting to happen,If you follow this you will get back pain and risk ending up like Fred Couples.
5,Excellent instruction book. Worked great for me.,"I read the book and implemented the instructions and my game improved immediately. Some of the basic instructions I had done when I was younger and I had gotten away from them. The other two, the early hand set and the hip move have transformed my game back to what I know I can do, but much more consistently. I will actually go practice some this week, but the actual playing has been exactly the improvements I had been looking for and not finding in other instruction books I have purchased."
5,"BEST GOLF BOOK EVER, BUT BEWARE....",".....understand that the movement of the hips laterally MUST be initiated by the back leg pushing your weight towards the target. If you just laterally shift the hips by themselves....well, that's a catastrophe. Watch this slow motion video of George Knudson carefully to see the proper form.[...]"
4,JET CD - Puffy's Greatest Hits,"If you look at JET CD as a greatest hits album of sorts (5 hit singles, all of them excellent), then it is a great album. However, the whole thing doesn't fit together so well as a standalone album. It is worth every penny though, just for those 5 singles alone. Very diverse sounds: from disco to the Beatles to the 50's. JPOP at its finest.Here's the track listing:1. JETTO keisatsu 2. kore ga watashi no ikiru michi 3. CAKE IS LOVE 4. ai no shirushi 5. haru no asa 6. REMON KIDDO 7. kobijin 8. NEHORIINA HAHORIINA 9. tetsugaku 10. DE RIO 11. SAAKITTO no musume 12. nagisa ni matsuwaru EKUSETORA 13. MOTHER"
4,puffy's jet cd is cool!,puffy amiyumi made a song lemon kid? Well I like jet policeit's cool also on the other album an illustrated historybut it's more cooler on that album!
5,mountain 8401 Top Metal Can Tap,"Work as expected it should, when unhooked it holds can pressure. It hooks up to my feed line with no need for teflon tape."
3,"Good quality, great service","The quality and description were just as advertised on this pan, our only problem was with the weight. It was much too heavy to use practically, so we returned it. The return went well and shopper's choice provided all of the necessary information for it."
4,It's a good read,It's a good read if you like military political books. Amazon sucks for making requirements on word length in reviews if I were them I wouldn't do that but you know what can I do. Anyways one of Dale Brown`s better books.
5,Battle Born,Patrick McLANAHAN HAS DONE IT AGAIN. Battle Born was a very graphic story the you did not want to stop reading. Planning on reading it again in the future.
2,Battle Bored,"If you like your Political Correctness hot and heavy,you'll love Battle Born. Have a blast counting the modern archtypyes so comman in todays Hollywood Films.Lieutentant Colonel Rebecca Furness;who out flies and out swears her PC squad. See Rebecca and Rinc (aka deadmeat) in the most stilted forced relationship on paper.You'll love Vice President Ellen and her tough as nails Secert Service Agent Corrie Law. If you can get by the characters,the plot has promise.However like Rinc flying skill ,it just doesn't deliver the goods on target. The climax is well... misplaced,it seems like it would belong in the middle of the book,a minor battle. It only the Koreans that made it remotely interesting,thus the two stars. This book reads as if Dale Brown is looking for a postion in the Clinton White House. I'll be dropping my copy off to local book drive,so beware out there."
4,Worthwhile read,"The amount of dedication that Rutherfurd obviously put into this sprawling epic is enough by itself to give this book a decent review. Both informing and inviting, it's the kind of book you get lost in for the summer. It is true that characters are shown the door as soon as they are ushered in, and not enough time is given to truly connect with them. But since so many of their traits are passed along through the generations, their appeal does not lesson with each new character. Chances are, if you liked a member of a certain family, three hundred years later, his descendant might appeal to you as well. The geographical descriptions, history, and people of England are all personified so passionately by Rutherfurd that, though Sarum along with his other works, share similar faults, they are undeniably superb literary works."
3,The Beach House is good for the Beach House,"This is Chick Lit about the dynamics between a mother and her daughter,a sister and her brother, a girl and a guy - with a sub-plot of loggerhead turtles, this is absolutely the one to choose when you just want a book that's an easy read. I enjoyed the book even though it was predictable, sometimes down right ""syrupy"" and you will say a few times ""oh give me a break"" but all in all it's worth the time... some comments reference the language, don't know what they were reading, some reference the Christian aspect in the book, I found nothing to warrant that either, I found the Beach House to be a nice, easy, read with the characters well developed, if I had to fault it , I would say it was just too predictable and life doesn't always go this way but then again it is fiction.Short Review:This book won't over work your brain but it's really a very enjoyable,light read. I say it's a yes to the purchase."
2,Typical,"I couldn't finish this book because it's too predicatble and fluffy for me.I appreciate the info on the turtles but the story itself has been done billion of times...A wealthy, beautiful (but doesn't realize how beautiful she is) strong minded woman leaves home, returns and finds love. End of story."
3,Light beach read,"Love ready about the lowcountry, easy beach read. Plot line was predictable, but still enjoyed the book and the setting."
4,Great book,"I loved this story and will read it again...and share it with friends.The book made me laugh, cry and learn. What more can you ask from a book?"
4,Excellent Remake of Sci-Fi Classic,"This is a fine remake of the 1956 classic made during the Communist scares of the 1950s. The political implications, especially in original version, are clear. The remake is considerably longer (possibly a little too long) and is genuinely creepy with excellent performances by Donald Sutherland, Brooke Adams, Leonard Nimoy and the supporting cast. There are very effective visual and sound effects and a fine and chilling music score by Denny Zeitlin. Director Philip Kaufman paces the film in such a way as to keep you guessing, especially if you haven't seen the original. Kevin McCarthy, the lead in the 1956 version, has a good cameo in this remake.The film benefits from the high definition of Blu-ray at times making things uncomfortably clear.I was glad to see this film brought to Blu-ray. Now, how about George Pal's ""The Time Machine"" (1960)?"
2,Not so great,"The plot was weak, the acting was so so even with Leonard Nimoy. Not a real good remake."
3,They didnt come to get me,"I have to give this movie its due, good special effects, the creepy factor, and the suspense works. The thing that left me disappointed was the ending, it felt rushed, and poorly thought out, like oops out of budget. Over all a disappointing movie, sorry I bought it."
4,3 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:A clever and (suprisingly) not irrelevant remake of the classic 1956 film with a final shot to rival all others, Invasion of the Body Snatchers' depiction of 70s San Francisco may seem a bit dated, but its chills are most definitely not."
5,It does work at work.,"Don't confuse the ease of reading this excellent book with the depth and power of the information within it. Being involved in software project management myself, I related to the ideas the author expressed and feel I have learned much from reading the book. Other project managers in my company are now reading this book and share similar opinions.The book contains good explanations of various techniques for formalising projects. It also contains a number of case study experiences which are very apt.I recommend this book to project managers of all levels and to managers of software companies."
1,INCORRECT VERSION,I have tried twice to purchase the correct version of the DVD Flanders & Brussels. Both times I received the PAL version which does not work in the US or Canada. I did click on the correct item when I ordered but somehow kept getting the wrong one. The Returns dept. was very pleasant and helpful for me to return the useless DVDs.It does not deserve the one star I was forced to give it above
2,Not floor length as in photo - a little disappointed,"I purchased this for my granddaughter. She is 5'2"" - photo shows a floor length cape, this was not. Would probably be fine for someone shorter unless length is a consideration."
5,Great books and educational too!!,My sons 2nd grade teacher got him started on these book and we have read every single one. Not only are they fun but they are educational too!!!!
5,It is G! You people need to fix that marked rating.,"My name is Adam, and despite the fact that I like action packed films, this one is still one of my favorites. I love the way it is filmed, and how they found the perfect acors for the job. I recommend this film to any and all. Believe it or not I am 6 ft 1 and 200 lbs and 16 years old, some people think that it is strange that I would like this movie, but we all have little kids inside us that love this type of film. If you have a tender heart, then I promise you will be crying by the end of the film. I didn't personally, but it hit my mom pretty hard :)"
2,Some pleasing settings - but atrocious acting,"Okay, maybe it's because this was designed to be a ""children's movies"" and the powers that be decided acting was not a priority... I can overlook that the people in the movie are caricatures and stereotypes more than developed individuals. Okay, the main character is unbelievably good and the school master is unreasonably mean. That is to be expected. The problem for me was that every time a character opened their mouth I cringed at what came out.The plot was good, but I was amazed at how terrible the acting was. It was as if the children were asked to read their lines in the most sugary tones possible. Especially the main character.I think ""children's movies"" can certainly have layers to their characters and can feature actors that can actually act. Unfortunately, this is not one of those movies."
5,Great story and great acting!!!,I love the movie. I think is the best movie I ever seen in my life. If you have a little girl at home you must watch this movie with her. The story line is very simple but heart touching. Is just great!!!
2,This isn't the one...,"""A Little Princess"" is a great story. Sadly, this movie doesn't tell it. A Hollywood-influenced director got hold of the story and stuffed it with all the elements of a cheesy American thriller film -- a chase with the heroine dangling by her fingertips from a balcony, a villainesse too evil to imagine, AMNESIA (for crying out loud!) I was especially put off by the 20th-century attitude coming out of the mouth of this Victorian-era girl.Don't buy this version; find the Wonderworks version of A Little Princess, and buy that one. It's faithful to the novel, and it's superb."
2,ELOISE - the Single,"Eloise is a great song . In fact the song is the same as ""Growing ' up"" just with different lyrics . Great Lyrics, I must mentionn . We miss the Lyrics on the card box ( very poor for Springsteen fans ) . All the rest of the CD is pretty basic and sounds like "" John Cougar Mellecamp "" . Eloise should have been a single . Anyway , for Springsteen fans ( like me ) it is a MUST to have this CD ."
1,Not of great value,I did not find this book of much use during my trip. It did not go deep enough into the attributes of the cities I wanted to visit. I took it with me but did not use it.
4,Fun sewing,"I loved this book and the patterns. I'm not a real experienced quilter, but I learned so much from doing all of these designs. It was so much fun picking out the materials for the individual blocks."
3,disappointing quality,"I was disappointed with the quality of this kitchen considering the price. The back is not enclosed, so the food and utensils fall behind it. It is make of thinner plastic compared to little tyke kitchens. Our oven door falls off. It is also light weight, so when you open the doors you can easily pull the whole kitchen down on you."
4,North Korean Memoirs: The life of an american agent who defected to north korea,I found this book very interesting. Foolish man to defect to a communist country. The editing of this book was poor. Many grammar and spelling errors.
3,Beyond Tourist Greece,"Although melancholy and overly negative, Kizilos offers some solid information about Greece. The book would be of more interest to the traveller who anticipates an extended visit to Greece rather than a quick trip. The book is organized by sections on the sea, borderlands, and the village, but it sounds a little too much like ""and then I did this."" Sometimes she hinges on being judgmental such as when she complains about sightseers or claims that ""Greece is full of people who are unashamedly idle."" She does include interesting cultural tidbits such as the superstitious grandmother who makes her daughter-in-law stay inside for forty days after giving birth to avoid the evil eye and the fact that Tuesdays are bad luck in Greece because it was on a Tuesday that the Turks overran Constantinople. There's also a handy description of Lesbos' uneasy stance towards Sappho, the revered female poet."
1,strange book,it was interesting at first but it kept draging on and on. the characters were very corny and not funny at times.
5,Prime B.B. King live!What else do you want?,"This cd captures B.B. King at the height of his tremendous powers.Both his singing and backing band are superb but it's""the man's""smoking guitar playing that sets this one a blaze.The sound quality is surprisingly good.If you dig the blues,get this."
4,Good movie for what it is!,"Something Beneath is a good movie,for what it is. Kevin Sorbo does a good job playing the priest. It wasn't as scary as you might think it is. The one thing I don't like is the packaging of the dvd. I was told that the version released in Australia has a picture of Sorbo on the cover. I would have much preferred that to the cover of the US release-I don't even remember that scene being in the movie!"
1,Kindle Fire Issues,"Yes indeed last reviewer--I love the Bible, but the Kindle Fire hyperlinks never work and much of the text in the back overlaps digitally. Please fix!"
3,Life Application Study Bible NLT,I have been searching for quite some time for one that has JESUS'S WORDS IN RED!!!! is there a trick to getting it to come out in red on my Kindle Fire? When we looked at it to purchase it showed it in red. Once purchased no red..... Very disapointed. Other than that it is a good version to take to church to follow and access during sermon.If anyone knows a trick to getting it to go red PLEASE let me know. Thank you in advance!! Blessings.
3,LIFE APPLICATION STUDY BIBLE,HAVEN'T GOT ALL THE KNOWHOW TO READ IT. THE KINDLE IS NEW TO ME AND I AM JUST LEARNING TO USE IT.
1,The footnote links do not work for the kindle iPad,The footnote links do not work on the kindle iPad. Don't buy it until they get this fixed. It used to work when I first bought it. Amazon support doesn't know what the problem is.
5,NLT personal size,"The best part of reviewing a bible is, you don't critique the content. This is primarily an opinion on features. I bought mine used on Amazon. Great money saver and I git a flawless copy. This is a great study bible. I use mine for my men's group at church, and for on the go reading and vacations. Anyhow, the footnotes are invaluable. Simply worded, they help me understand what I don't comprehend on my own, often relating scripture in more contemporary terms. This is most helpful for Old Testament reading. As in say, Deuteronomy, or Leviticus. The concordance, and intro to the books has also helped aid me in my studies. I like the NLT best for the translations ability to eliminate complexity and provide explanation. My one complaint is, there's no built in book marker, so I keep a prayer card to mark my spot, not really s big deal. All in all a great bible."
4,good study bible,"This is a good study bible. At the beginning of each book it has a short outline and summary of the book. It describes main characters and places in the bible. There's a timeline of events. There are footnotes from various contributors that help the reader to understand the passages and how they can apply to our lives today.The only downside I find is that the pages are very, very thin and the writing very small (typical of many bibles)."
5,Great used Bible,Good Bible even used. I like how it explains the verses in detail. It is a lot thicker than the pictures make it look.
4,Great NLT Bible,"I really love this bible which as good size font. I like the Master Index and the Concordance (you can find anything your looking for either by subject or actual scripture word). I love the notes because they are easy to understand and point out things I would never have thought of. It has great short bios on individuals in the bible and nice charts to help you think more about the scripture (I like the one on money). The only thing I don't care for is the supper thin pages which are see through meaning you can see the next page as your reading previous page. Also, I would love to see alphabetical index in the front."
5,Best study bible,We got this bible to understand parts of the bible which needs more explanation. We came to know many things logically and why some situations could have happened. You will not regret buying this one.
1,Kindle Fire Life Application Bible,I would like to buy this Bible but won't purchase it until the sample version has functional links. The problems in the trial version do not instill confidence.Life Application Study Bible NLT
2,"Nice, but...","I love this Bible and I bought this eBook version because I find it easier to read on my Kindle and smart phone. The problem I am having is that when I drill down into the cross references, I cannot get back to the original book and chapter where I started without tapping the menu button then the back button in the list. If you really like to drill down to gleen all there is in this great Bible, it really requires a quick finger session with your Android to get back to where you were. The regular back button that requires only one tap is not functional with this Bible and/or my smartphone while using this Bible. The regular back button is functional with other apps. If using this in a Bible study setting, you may find it quite frustrating. I am using an LG G2X smartphone, but sometimes I it acts like a dumb phone.I sure hope they fix the navigation for this Bible and put out a free update."
3,Wrong bible shipped,"I ordered a leather bound bible, what I received was a two tone, light blue and brown, imitation leather bible. This is not the way it was advertised. I did call they offered for me to send it back, but said when I receive the replacement one, they could not guarantee that it wouldn't be the same as I already received. So then I said well it don't make sense to send it back, just to receive the same thing yet again, so how about some credit. He gave me $5.00 back from my purchase price, so was resolved. So if ordering this bible, be careful and ask all questions beforehand, so you aren't disappointed. I am good with the outcome."
3,Excellent Version but Poor Binding,"The New Living Translation along with it's Life Application study notes make the bible easy to understand, and I highly rate this version. I could not give five stars because of the shoddy workmanship; the cover had scratches, pages bent in, and binding is glued not smythe sewn I rather doubt it will last."
2,Certain Chapters are slow to show up on Kindle Fire,"Just as other people have stated below, certain chapters do not show up while reading on the Kindle Fire. You'll be reading and come upon a blank page. When you flip to the next page you'll see you've skipped a chapter. You have to flip back and forth over the blank page to get the missing chapter to show up. It's extremely annoying. I read the issues other people had before buying, but wanted to see if the issue had been fixed. Well, as of 28 March 2012 the issue has not been fixed and I returned it for a full refund. On the plus side Amazon makes it very easy to return from the Kindle Library."
3,Kindle Fire links don't work,"I have the same problem as others--I downloaded this for my new Kindle Fire, thinking it would be a great way to have the study notes handy without carrying such a large Bible. But the links don't work...very disappointing. Come on, Amazon and Tyndale, please fix this and put an update out or something. I'd have given it 5 stars if the links worked."
3,Slow shipping,"This item took a while just to ship out, and then took the long way around to get here. Where it shipped from is less than four hours away, but it took more than a week to be delivered from the time it was shipped. Also, it was much smaller than I was anticipating, which made the type face very small and difficult to read."
5,awesome,"The Thexton pedal depressor is AWESOME;It is SO simple in design, easy to use AND it saves time and money. I use it every day to check brake lights. Now I dont have to ask for help or interrup anybody anymore. Thank you. This product is AWESOME!!!"
1,amateur writing and disingenuous,"I was very disappointed in the misspellings, the atrocious grammar and the definite narcissistic bent. (Many others have commented on this as well.) Too bad.Not only that, the author makes a big deal about interviewing so many fascinating people across all racial/economic, etc. lines, but three people featured in book are friends of his wife; two went to high school with her. I suppose it's not a huge deal but seems a bit lazy and disingenuous."
3,Having the time and money to change direction.,This is not a self help book. It does contain interesting stories about already successfull people with money who want to do something more meaningful with their lives. Nothing wrong with that but don't look for too much inspiration or any answers in these stories.
2,Self-Serving and Vapid,"Po Bronson graduated from Stanford with a degree in Economics and then went on to a relatively successful career in i-banking. Suddenly he realized that his life was meaningless and be chucked it all be become a writer (What else?).He wrote this book about Yuppies like him who are seeking meaning in their lives. For the most part, they come up with the expected answers -- religion, teaching, working for non-profits.Because Bronson is relatively young (30s), he lacks the experience necessary to provide true insight (Sorry, Po, Silicon Valley existed long before you wrote about it). Because most of his subjects are his age and come from similarly privileged backgrounds, they do too. It would have proven more fruitful for him to have talked with some older people who had fought in the trenches and gained the perspective to view the quest from the far end.The subject obviously struck a chord. It remains for someone else to understand and explain it."
4,Stuck in a rut?,"I agree with most of the preceeding reviews -- if you feel stuck in a rut, you should try this book. I found it to be a good tool for stirring up creative ideas, and for encouraging what the psychologist Maslow advocated -- making the 'growth choice' rather than the 'fear choice' in your life."
2,"Okay, but agree with need for an editor","I actually purchased the Audio CD version. In in the audio version I had to fight through the odd metaphors and exaggerated descriptions at every turn. The sporadic curse word ""sh*t"" and ""FU money"" were ill-fitting and shocking. Overall, there were some good stories documented and a few bits of wisdom interwoven throughout. It won't answer the ever popular, ""What should I do with my life"" but there are some questions that the author poses that anyone searching should consider."
5,"I like it, it makes you think..","Wow! I'm very surprised there's a lot of negative reviews here. For me, I don't think the book is that bad.I agree 100% with a review from ""YOU must answer the question..., June 17, 2003Reviewer: A reader.""Couldn't have said it better than that, so please read his review instead..just my 2 cents."
2,"Vapid, not at all Inspiring","I am in fact the ""yuppie scum"" that many of the reviewers have such disdain for (why, only they know). In any event, I, unhappy in my present career, was looking for a book that would inspire me to make a change. Don't be deceived, this is not a self-help book. The stories of the individuals in the book are half-baked, uninspiring and in certain instances go unresolved. There are no useful insights or ""gems"" to be taken and used in our personal lives. The writing by Po (or editing by his publisher) is disjointed and confusing. I could only get through about three-quarters of this drivel before putting it down."
2,"title should be: ""Redefining the Yuppie""","This book was an easy read and it was fun to learn what peopledo with their lives. However, halfway through the book, yourealize the ""real people"" in this book are allwhite (or asian) whining yuppies in the 25-35age range and it gets annoying. Oh gee, next time I gothrough life going to ivy league schools, and I'mtorn between my job as a professional dancer anda stock broker with a zillion dollar salary andI want to quit it all to become a school teacher, but I haveto sell my BMW, I'll know i'm not alone."
4,"inspiring book, but too autobiographical","This book of regular people's amazing stories is inspiring. Unfortunately, Po Bronson (or ""Po Bro'"" as my SO and I call him) interjects too much of himself into other people's stories. He literally wastes 50% of some chapters discussing how HE feels about the interviewee, how HE helped the interviewee, and how the interviewee reminds him of HIS own experiences. He should have spent more time relaying the people's stories."
1,DISAPPOINTED,"After reading some reviews, I was looking forward to this book. I am amazed that this book received so many good/excellent reviews. I found that the stories were told in a very superficial/anecdotal manner. I did not find them interesting nor did I learn much. The author did try to present this topic in a new manner but I find that it does not work. The book is also mistitled since most of the people described in this book did not find an ""answer to the ultimate question"". Finally, the author refers to himself in every story. It was not necessary and I found it very annoying."
1,Why me?,"Hoping to find inspiration in this book, I did find some. At least my life isn't as condescending and dull as Po Bronson's.Thank you for sharing some of the dullest stories I've ever read (although I'm sure they COULD be interesting if told by another less self absorbed writer).Also, your views of Texas, San Antonio and Alamo Heights are clouded.I think Po Bronson has potential as a writer (and as a person) if he would stop believing that the world revolves around him. Just look at his web site...gads!"
1,Very shallow people with very shallow lives,I found this book to be very boring and provided very little insight. Most of the stories are from very shallow self-centered Gen-Xers. Most of the life stories involve changes that took place in the last several months so it does not provide any real perspective on life choices and effects on a lifetime. Po is not a very good writer. He is boring and very impressed with himself. Don't waste your money or your time.
1,Po Bronson - What Should I Do with My Life,The notion of searching for purpose has intrigued me and as a consequence I purchase and read a broad variety of books on the subject. This book is one best left in warehouses left gathering dust. It is superficial hype and damages the broader reputation of the industry and writers interested in providing perspective and programs dealing with the subject of calling and purpose.
1,"Should be called ""What Does Po Bronson Tell Me To Do With My Life""","Rarely do I ever stop reading a book, but I just had to quit on this one. The idea of the book is great, I'm a year or two out of college and am not quite sure what I want to do and where I want to go in life. I picked this book up at a used book store, and was excited to get started. Unfortunately, after only a couple of interviews it's painfully obvious that ""Po Knows Best"". This man is in love with himself. Every interview goes something like this:""So what do you want to do with your life?"" - Po asks.""I'm not quite sure, but I really like to do ____"" they respond.""Hey, why don't you do THAT for the rest of your life."" Po says.""You are a genius, I never thought of THAT before"". they reply.And that's it, every story seems to be about how great Po is, and how he enlightens them to go for their true calling. It's also about how highly they all think of him, and how they all become friends with him. Please, avoid at all costs."
1,Massive waste of time,"I am upset at how much of a waste this book was ,nothing useful or insightful just unfinished stories of quick coffee cup meetings with people in flux."
2,"Nice title, but not so good content","I began reading the book with a lot of spectation, but after the 4th or 5th chapter I was bored. It's about life of people that decided to change their lifes but it's just too superficial.I left the book, and just when I don't have anything else to read I open it again and read one more life.I hope there are better books to help us decide a change of life style."
1,Poor Product!,I purchased these and followed the directions exactly - even waiting more than 24 hours before the bath tub was used.I took a shower and FIVE of the stickers came up. Five more came up when my kids took their baths.Don't waste your money! Pay a little more for a better brand! The customer service was great! Just a poor product.
4,Good old school,I bought this TAPE back in the day based on the cover alone (which is different that the CD cover). Pretty sweet old school beats. The track listing is different on my tape however...they must have found some more Wiz tracks when it came time to make the CD..
5,He Still has it!,"The voice is craggier and the tunes are just as good or better than many of his earlier classics...essential for Hag fans! In addition, his band keeps getting tighter and is a great joy to listen to."
5,"The Spirit Window really has just that, Spirit!","The Spirit Window was an extremely capivating book. When I read it, it was like I was right there, with Miranda, feeling and experiencing everything. Ms. Sweeney has a way of making you feel for her characters. It makes you want to laugh when they laugh, and cry when they cry. They attraction between Miranda and Adam was very sweet and captivating. I found it touching. From when he scared her to death when they first met to thier symbolic farewell, it was well, wonderful."
3,Bee Gees Living Eyes,Gift for husband who has collected BGs for years. He was unaware of this European version and was very happy with it.
1,Bad choice,"Bought these earrings along with another pair from another vendor. They arrived about 5 days later than the other pair. NOW - the ""aquamarine"" ball on the hoop has fallen off. Nowhere to be found, which brings up another point. You can hardly see the ""small disc ball"" - so, when they say small, they mean small. About half the size of an eraser on a pencil. Now - the ball has gone AWOL. don't waste your time with these.As an update - I have yet to be contacted by the seller to even offer a refund on these earrings.So, ""Buyer Beware"""
4,Map came in very handy.,"It can fit into a pocket or purse easily, and I love that its laminated. It can get wet without a problem, and it doesn't get damaged or torn."
4,Bootie-licious!,"I actually purchased a 9.5 and felt they were a little too big and then ordered a size 9. The 9 didn't fit well the arch was too short, so I sent them back and kept the 9.5. They are very nice, I've been looking for a nice pair of boots for 5 years. I get a lot of compliments, from people of all ages (20-65). Not too young looking, not too old looking. They are the perfect boot. One little negative....I needed to put in a pad for the front part of my foot - not a lot of cushion. After that I can wear them all day long. I should have ordered them in brown!!!"
2,not oem,"I purchased these to replace a cracked original flare. they look exactly the same. The fender flares are not OEM. The original flares are bolted to the vehicle. This flare uses tape to hold it to the vehicle and several self tapping screws to hold them into the tire well. the tape is recessed and it is difficult to get it to adhere to the vehicle. The size of the flare is just slightly off. When the flare is forced into the actual position, the other side pops off. I've had them for a week, and I had to purchase more trim tape. When this tape is placed on top of the original tape, it causes a gap. I haven't found an answer yet.Pretty to look at but not really funtional."
3,not suited for thin or small feet,"This seemed like the perfect gift, unless the user is a small woman with size 5 feet. I have size 6 feet and the sides barely touch the feet, so a real foot massage is out of the question. More suited for people with large or very wide feet."
4,Happy feet and legs,"The foot massager is great. It's open design allows it to be used on the legs as well as the feet unlike others that are boot like. The massager adjusts to your size legs and feet automatically for a snug fit. The massager is adjustable to almost any configuartion with tilt, raise/lower and etc. The only problem with this device is that it can become top heavy as a result of the adjustability of it. So keeping it upright can be a bit challenging. But for the price and quality this is a great relief on the feet and legs as well as wallet."
2,"My puppy loves this, but I only tolerate it!","I only tolerate this toy, because it's one of the few toys that my puppy will chew on for long periods of time. This toy has serious safety issues, and I will only let her play with it when I can supervise her. She is a toy dog, isn't an aggressive chewer, and is normally easy on her toys. However, the little dangly ties at the end of the bone are always coming off, and I am constantly chasing after her to prevent her from swallowing the ties when they become loose. For the most part, I have re-tied the ropes using various types of knotts, and have found that after about a month, the ties don't become loose as much because her saliva has made them stiff."
2,Not for determined chewers,"I purchased this for a 29 pound mixed breed with a small mouth. The medium size bone that Orka makes is huge so I thought this size was more appropriate. I don't think of my dog as an exceptionally tough chewer but she ripped chunks of blue plastic off this toy within a few minutes. My dog loved the toy but, sadly, it only lasted about ten minutes. I thought the strings were dangerous, a potential choking or bowel obstruction hazard, and removed them before giving the toy to my dog."
2,Not bad if you have a light chewer.... not necessarily for terriers,"I have two Jack Russell Terriers under a year old, including one that's an aggressive chewer. We bought one of these when they were around 4-5 months, almost done cutting their adult teeth. Within 48 hours of buying this toy, the non-chewer stripped the three fabric ties off, and the chewer chewed off one of the nubs on the other end. This toy is for either a) very young puppies or b) light chewers."
2,Started flaking soon after purchase,"A couple months after I purchased this belt, the leather started flaking off the front. It's not so bad because it's covered by the overlap of the belt. Probably would have chose a higher quality belt if I had known that would be the case."
4,Comfort belt,This belt looks and feels good. When you order your size be sure to consider the fact that the belt does have some stretch to it. I have to use the first hole in the belt to get a reasonably snug fit. You might want to order the size smaller than your usual pant size.
3,Too much stretch,Belt will extend about one more size. If you have a 34 inch waist buy a 34 inch belt. Size was only real negative at that price point.
4,Comfortable,"I purchased this belt for my husband and he really enjoys it. The braided leather has enough stretch to it, so that he doesn't feel like he's being restricted in movement in any way. It looks great with both dress and casual clothing. He is very pleased with this purchase."
5,Very good Belt!!,"I recommend this belt, It is exactly as advertised, I am satisfied with the quality of it... I usually don't recommend buying belts or shoes by internet, but I am very happy I made this purchase!"
2,Stretchy belt stretches out,"The stretchiness does make this belt more comfortable, but it alsoseems to stretch out. In my case this was about a month, and nowit does not work so well, even on the last hole."
4,A very good metal guitar album,"The greatest strength of Narnia rests in the amazing talents of their guitarist, Carl Grimmark. At times I felt as though I was listening to Yngvie Malmsteen. Grimmark's playing style is fast and very similar to Yngvie's. The vocals on this album are also decent and the production quality is above average.This album is at its best when they rock hard and fast. This is Narnia's best album and has the highest production quality. If you liked either of their first two albums, then I guarantee you will like this one. The only weak spot on this album is that a few of the songs have a slower tempo and didn't impress me much (other than the fantastic guitar solos). If you like Impellitteri, Yngvie Malmsteen, or just plain guitar shreddin', then you should check out ""Desert Land"" by Narnia."
5,Friggin Awsum,They play better than most bands put together. Lyrics are good. Cant say i havnt liked a single song ive heard of theirs. Youll definitely like them if ur into any havy metal.
5,Narnia IS BACK !!!,well...the first time i heard little carljohann i was amazed - i thought it was The king itself - MR. Yngwie !!! i was shocked to know that a 20-22 year old guy can play like that... this album is great...better than the second but still...the first one is the best... Long Live The King !!!
5,I just love it!,"I bought one for my apartment. I didn't think it was going to be all that good, but I tell you this little gizmo gets the job done. It's not perfect (just like any other technology out there), but if you give the little machine the right enviroment (no small cords, drapes or small socks on the floor where to get stuck) you'll be amazed at how much dirt it picks up!The only other thing I've noticed is that it does have a little bit of a problem finding it recharging base. But... oh well, I don't have to vacuum that often anymore!"
2,It's cheaper to sweep!,"I really, really wanted a Roomba, but it's just not what I thought it would be. It would probably work better if we didn't have any furniture, because once it runs into a table leg, it has to keep hitting it until it works far enough to the side for the sensor to send it off in a new direction. I have tile floors through my home, but in the kitchen the Roomba will wedge itself under the cabinets and get stuck. In the living room it will bounce itself off of one sofa leg into another, same thing in the bedroom, it bounces off of one leg of the bedframe into another. The result is that there are a lot of spots that the Roomba never covers and some that it covers over and over. If you have huge rooms and minimal furniture the Roomba may work for you, but if you live in an 1800 sq foot home with the average amount of furniture, it's much faster and more effective to just use a broom."
4,Works Very Good!,I'm very pleased with the Irobot Roomba 4230. It works alot better then I thought it would. I mainly wanted it to pick up our cats fur when shedding but it picks up much more then that. More quiet then a full size vacuum. Don't get it thinking it will make your floor spotless but it comes close!
5,Just one less thing to do!!,"I don't really remember what life was like before the Roomba. I think we had some big heavy upright looking thing that we had to push and pull back and forth across the flooring. But seriously, this was definately the best purchase for our household in 2006. The price is perfect, and the thing just keeps on going. The best part is that after a while, you forget that you even have it. You just come home, empty the dirt bin, and go about your business in your effortlessly clean house. We have pets and the hair builds up in the carpet over time. After two weeks of daily service (every day at 10:00 am) the floors are not only spotless, but the fine hairs have been eradicated from the carpet. Don't just buy one. Buy one for everyone you know!"
1,DISAPPOINTED,Received Roomba broken. Could hear the pieces rattling before I even opened the packaging. The piece that holds in the brushes was broken in several places. Could not believe the lack of quality of plastic used. Based on the lack of quality of the broken piece I chose not to have a replacement sent. Idea is great but until product is better made I will not be purchasing.Was very pleased though with Amazon. Return was arranged promptly and refund was credited to my account promptly as well.
4,"not too bad, but need quality control","I gave the roomba 4 stars, it really works very well and more than what I expected. But some of the plastic parts, such as the filter holder made of plastic and metal wire was a piece of crap. It failed only after 10 uses."
1,Remanufactured? No Thanks.,"Love those Irobot products and everything they're capable of doing. In fact, this was my third purchase, but my first remanufactured product. What a headache! The product worked correctly just three times, then died. Both technical support and customer service from Irobot were helpful and prompt, but still took weeks to resolve the issues. I tried a different way of recharging, which didn't work. Then they replaced the battery, but that still didn't solve the problem. Ultimately I had to send the product back, then waited more than a month for a replacement, which was on backorder. Finally, they substituted a different model, and which works just as advertised. I'd never buy another remanufactured model. But I still believe in Irobot."
4,Robot cleaner,"The I-robot cleans well, in a random pattern rather than a comprehensive one. I still need to use my usual vacuum to get places this doesn't quite cover. However it does things my regular vacuum doesn't like getting under furniture, couches, etc. I'm pleased with it because I'm a gadget guy."
2,Customer Support is horrible,"We've had our Roomba Scheduler for a year now and it is fun (although not a serious vacuuming device). The battery stopped charging so I tried to call customer support. 1 hour on hold without ever answering. The Roomba is apparently still under warranty, but it won't do my any good if I can't ever get through to someone...."
1,This vacuum really BLOWS!,"Good luck, I have had nothing but problems with mine. It spends most of it's time spinning in circles. If not, it is stuck, on, up, or under something. Major dissapointment! Tech support has been weak at best. There seems to be no where you can send it for repair or evaluation. I have never put it in to any room and had it work. I have followed all Roomba's tips and still nothing. Think long and hard on this one. My ""regular"" vacuum is far more dependable."
3,OK,"This is probably not going to be my first choice for ginger extracts, it's not as strong as most of the products that I use."
5,A Must read for Christian Parents with Children,"This children's book is way over due. Endorsed By Dr. D. James Kennedy and Dr. Beverly LaHaye. The story of Little Sarah and her encounter with those in the ""gay movement"" will shock some, please others, and should lead to healthy family discussions with your children. If you have children in public school you should get them this book!"
4,British cozy,"My wife loved this series. It was. A bit forced for me, but she enjoyed it. Not a grabber but a simple passtime"
5,Rosemary and Thyme Complete Series,"When I found this on my Netflix they were showing only one series. I just love the friendly banter, the antics, the companionship of these two women. The set arrived quickly, in very good condition and I was watching it within minutes.Thank you,Glenda Marie Rock III"
1,Wideacre ~ no more than a soap opera,"This may be classified as historical fiction, but it's simply a verbose and vapid soap opera set somewhere in colonial times (I'm guessing at that one too, since the time it is set seems unclear). There are no outward events mentioned to give any bearing on actual time, and the entire plot takes place on one estate.Irritatingly repetitive, unlikely plots, and rather disgusting intrigues led me to simply want to finish the book to finish it, not to see what happens. Unless you enjoy daytime soaps, this book probably isn't for you."
1,Scarlett O'Hara's Evil Twin,"You have heard of ""Buyer Beware""? Well this would be ""Book Beware"" I picked this up as a beach read,it was so bad I felt I had to see it to the end if it could possibly redeem itsself...nope THANK GOD it fell in the ocean to spare me from finishing it! This book was horrible, it may have been made worse for me because I was expecting the normal Historical Romance story. This couldn't be farther from it. I don't want to give much away but definalty expect the unexpected."
2,Wideacre,"I was extremely disappointed in this book. I love historical novels, especially those that take place in England and Scotland. This novel has characters with no redeeming qualities and after an interesting beginning, goes steadily downhill from there. I doubt I will ever read another book by this author."
2,My least favorite Gregory novel....,"After reading numerous of Gregory's book, I was so looking forward to another. This book is about the young and beautiful Beatrice, who does pretty much anything to keep her land. Since she isn't able to inherit it at her father's death (which, of course, she has a hand in) she does pretty much anything to keep her hold on it.The incest really turned me off. I kept hoping it would eventually fizzle out, but after fathering the 2nd child by her brother, I just was even more turned off. There is no limit to what Beatrice will do to keep her land, but it gets a little ridiculous.After making it through about 2/3 of the book, I had to skip to the end and find out if it would be worth finishing. It really wasn't, as there is no silver lining. She does end up getting what she deserves but there is no joy in it."
1,Wideacre,"I have never sent in a review, but this novel is so disappointing I felt I owed it to your readers to say: ""Don't bother""! I thoroughly enjoyed ""The Other Boleyn Girl""..it is intelligently written and a fun ride! I was eager to read another by Ms. Gregory - ""Wideacre"" is tedious and uninteresting and dull and long and....etc etc. Don't waste your time!"
1,SICK!,"OK, As stated by many others, I am not a prude, but this book was twisted! The incestual relationship with the brother was (I am sitting here trying to come up with the right words, but can only come up with...) gross! Whenever the main character had the chance to do right, she screwed up. There was not one redeeming quality in her, making it difficult to want to continue on with the book. Not only was the plot sick, but l-o-n-g. Not one of Gregory's best, that is for sure!"
2,Didn't love it,"Let me preface by saying first that I am a huge fan of Philippa Gregory and love much of her work. I found this book to be horrifying, and not in the good, spine tingling way. The story is hardly plausible, although obviously it is intended to be fiction. I find it hard to believe that a woman can come to hate the man she loves in a matter of minutes when he discovers her betrayal. Reading the relationship she came to have with John and her horrible cruelty make it impossible to stomach the result of the novel. While her final meeting with Ralph made for an interesting twist, most of the book I read only for the sake of completing what I started."
2,Did not even finish it....,and that's saying a lot for me. Sorry I bought it. Just went on and on until I found something better to read.
1,I didn't even finish it.,"What a disappointment this book was! I too read ""The Other Boleyn Girl"" and picked this one to read next. Bad move. Why is this author so fixed on incest in BOTH these books? This one in graphic detail! Ugh! You have been warned."
1,A waste of time and money!,"I read The Other Boleyn Girl, and although I found some elements of the story distasteful (i.e., incest) I enjoyed the book overall, so I thought I'd give Wideacre a try. It was awful. I try very hard not to give up on a story too soon, so I kept putting it down and picking it up again to see if it would improve, but no such luck. It was so bad that I actually had to throw the book out (I NEVER throw out books - I usually hand them off to friends, but in all good conscience, I couldn't with this one)! What a waste of time and money."
2,Caution - Wiley paperback edition incomplete,"I ordered the paperback copy of this book. It turned out to be some sort of Wiley ""Custom Edition"" that intentionally omits chapters 9, 10, 11, 13, and any chapters above chapter 14. So if you want Laplace transforms, basic s-domain analysis and the other missing topics, you'll have to order the ""real"" book rather than the paperback edition. I am returning the paperback and re-ordering the harbound edition."
2,Below average,"My son is 10 and is a wrestling fan. He loves to wrestle with his action figures using tables, ladders and chairs. I was excited to order this product for him but disappointed with the quality. The ladder was o.k. but the table was poorly made. For such a simple product, you would think it would be easy to use,,,NOT!!!"
2,disappointed,"Have visited Rome twice before and wanted to get into the spirit before our upcoming trip, but sadly, this book generally fell short of the mark for me. There were several moments of enjoyment and delight, but I found it to be mostly self-indulgent and more often than not, did not enjoy the prose. Often I found things too ""wordy"" or phrased in a manner that detracted from the point he was wanting to make.Additionally, I wasn't pleased to discover that it was written in 1999. Although at the time there was much excitement about the upcoming new millennium, that excitement has now waned, and much of the book that was focused on that (as a result of being written when it was) is hard to get excited about today.I simply wanted to read something that would 'charge the batteries' and kick start our preparation of the upcoming trip, and although it did have some effect, it just didn't meet expectations for me."
2,Rambling Essays,"This book, unfortunately, seems to be trying to cash in on the lucrative trend for travel essays and tales of temporary ex-patriots. The author presents un-connected chapters, each containing musings about some aspect of Rome, but none has much of an idea, theme, or point. Reading this book reminded me of why I don't like to be invited to a slide show of somebody else's trip-- you had to be there. Amateur photography and amateur writing just do not convey the essence of a place very well. The writing in this book is undisciplined and the author makes the mistaken assumption that one's stream of consciousness without intellectual rigor will be interesting to someone outside his circle of family and friends. Not recommended."
4,La Dolce Vita,"I lived in Italy for a number of years and this book is a ... trip back to so many places, people and daily activities that I found so enjoyable in the first place. It rings true to life and captures the flavor, spirit and color of Roma and her people."
4,Big Talent,"Jo Dee Messina's self titled debut album sets the stage for an enigmatic performer, and the promise of good things to come in the future. The big hit single was ""Heads Carolina, Tails California"", arguably her best single to date. It also turned out hits like the uptempo ""You're Not In Kansas Anymore"", ""Do You Wanna Make Something Of It"" and the tender beautiful ballad ""He'd Never Seen Julie Cry"". There is other great moments on the album, such as two ballads which highlight the set, titled ""Let It Go"" and ""I Didn't Have To Leave You"". She has attitude and spunk to spare, and personality, which comes out in her music. Her next album I'M ALRIGHT even bettered this one, but this one is a good jumping point for a newcomer, and well worth checking out."
2,Decent if you like baseball numbers.,"A decent analysis of baseball statistics, full of all of the numbers you'd want to read. However, not nearly as valuable as the Bill James Baseball Abstracts, which goes beyond Elias to provide thought provoking and ground breaking discussions."
2,"Did not receive ""Belkin"" cables as advertised","Cables were received, in good time, however they were not ""belkin"" cables as advertised. Two of the five I ordered did not work."
5,Just thank you!,"I think a person would have a hard time, not taking something very meaningful, practical, and possibly life altering away from what Marianne has to say. If the definition of a miracle really is a shift in perception, then her messages are real miracles. I am continually given a higher vantage point on my path. thank you, Marianne."
5,Marianne Williamson: Inspirational Speaker,"I enjoy listening to the message that Marianne Williamson gives. She is inspirational, shares her insight & thoughts based on her life experiences and education. She always gives me a new perspective to think about regarding life, love, change, growth. I enjoy listening to her on the road, which is a time for reflection for many of us. Her philosophy has enriched my life and made me a better person."
3,Like it,Recording quality is fair. I haven't listened to the entire set. A lot of prayers on the CD that was most interesting to me. I still like Marianne and will listen to the whole set probably several times in my car as well as at home as background.
3,Little Joe,It has great music which we have on other CDs. Only thing is that it was not the one we thought we had ordered with other songs that were not on this CD for the price we paid. Glad to have it in our collection anyway..
4,it's OK,"I specifically bought this CD for ""One for the Treble"", so it was worth it. There are some other good songs on the CD but the quality is bad."
5,my cup of poison,this cd really rocks! poison is at its best with some great songs. the last song is a great ballad and can pull heart strings. the song I HATE EVERY BONE IN YOUR BODY BUT MINE has a catchy tune that has you singing whenever you want a fun song. the live songs are just what poison fans needed. i enjoyed this cd and so should every other poison fan!!!
2,Poison - Recycling the Music,"I am a diehard Poison fan, but this album is really not that good. The new studio music is mediocre while the live music does not sounds professional. Hats of to them for not touching up the live portion in the studio but perhaps they should have touched up Bret's vocals a tad."
2,Could be Better,"I know LeAnn Rimes has a good voice, but I just think that she has to use some of her own material to have the right to say she's a real singer. Sure there has been remakes of songs by other artists, but this album & her last one were both filled with remakes. She has great talent, but anyone can get up and sing someone else's songs. It's time that she has a song she can call her own. We all know she has the talent to do so, so why doesn't she."
5,What A Voice.,"Leann Has A Beautiful Voice. I Think Leann Sings ""How Do I Live"" Alot Better Then Trisha Yearwood. ""On The Side Of Angels"" Is My Favorite."
4,Heart warming music!,I have liked LeAnn since she came known as a musician I have all but 2 cd's. She sings very well and I respect and Love her Alot! Way to go Girl!
1,I Don't Get It,"Went over to a young-ish friend's house, walked in and heard this CD playing. I said, what's that, and she said happily, Leanne Rimes. This friend had apparently heard some of the songs on the CD before somewhere, and she was happy to hear them again all on one CD. Sad."
5,A great song by a great singer,Our music minister sang this song in church a few weeks ago. I had to have a copy. This song is a sweet love song.
4,Great album,"Very nice album, however i have several complaints about it. This album is not really original, because some of the songs, such as ""Amazing Grace"" and ""star spangled banner"" are OK, but you know, we can hear those songs anywhere. But, LeAnn does have a beautiful voice."
1,Horrible...Just Horrible,"This movie could be one of the worst I've ever seen. The acting is formulaic, the action and story are too. The only difference between this movie and other ""action"" movies is this one takes place with pirates and on ships. Some of the scenes are beyond laughable (for instance, Geena Davis, in one scene, outruns a team of horses while jumping through windows, dodging obstacles and leaping out another window). If you are aged 10-13, you might like it, otherwise consider yourselves warned. Oh, and the ""bad-guy death"" scene is the funniest thing I ever saw, but wasn't supposed to be."
2,Loads of fun...if you're 13!,"It's understandable that this movie never made it big. The acting is ridgedly cardboard, the realism strained, and the underlying romantic story nearly non-existant. There are some nice blockbuster special effects and some crafty stunt work, but they too often get mixed in along with the lousy (obvious?) effects and ridiculous sword play. The two saving graces of the movie are the fantastic (if not unrealistic) pyrotechnics work and the movie score. If you have to choose between the two, pick up the soundtrack over the movie."
5,One of the best action adventures ever,"This is one of my favorite movies. I am a pirate buff, and all of the details about pirates and the time period were accurate. This is not meant to be a realistic movie, but just fun and exciting like Indiana Jones."
5,Great non-stereotypical pirate movie!,"When I say non-stereotypical I mean that the pirate captain is a woman portrayed by Geena Davis (if I don't mistake, history tells about a female pirate skipper). Many reviewers bash this movie without good reasons. It had a good story line, great action with the best galleon explosions I have ever seen, and beautiful sets and costumes."
1,Casting mistake ruins movie potential,"Whose idea was it to have a woman play a pirate captain? Geena Davis isn't even remotely convincing in this movie, but blaming her for this tragedy would be unfair. As this colossal casting mistake annoys the viewer all the time, it is almost impossible to judge this movie with a neutral view. The movie itself is exciting and the acting level isn't bad. That is whyI think it is so terribly unfortunate that they messed everything up by casting Geena Davis as Morgan. You CANNOThave a woman perform swordfights with 3 men at the same time! (SARR)"
3,Ship-shape action.,"See this movie. When you know the two ships are going to close at the end and do battle, you know you're in for a heavy-duty duel! Geena Davis, Matt Modine, and Frank Langella make you want to be pirates. They do most of their own stunts! I want to be, need to be, Modine swinging from mast to mast. Frank Langella is almost as good as Ricardo Montalban in ""Star Trek II"" when he says ""Fire!"" The music is stirring and the main theme will have you humming after the film is over. If you liked this flick, check out the 1989 version of ""Treasure Island"" starring Chuck Heston as Long John."
5,"Excellent, exciting, dramatic score","First of all, I am one of the few people, it seems, who is proud to admit I LIKE THIS MOVIE! I know there seems to be a law against that, at least from the film crittics' p.o.v., but who cares? This score is EXCELLENT, especially the dramatic, memorable theme, ""Morgan's Ride."" If you liked this movie, you'll love the score. The music is similar to the score of ""Man in the Iron Mask"" in dramatic content. A five star rating!!"
2,Watch this 3 hours before the real SuperBowl Football Game.,"It's Super Bowl Sunday at the Los Angeles Coliseum and there is a sniper ready to shoot. This movie has an all-star cast: Charlton Heston, John Cassavetes and his wife, actress Gena Rowlands, Martin Balsam, Beau Bridges, Marilyn Hassett, David Janssen, Jack Klugman, Walter Pidgeon, David Groh, Pamela Bellwood, Ron Sheldon and many more. The sniper is ready to shoot at one person sitting in the stadium. (Which Hollywood star will be the one he shoots?) Watch the film to know the secret. Who is the sniper? When will he shoot? Who will he shoot? All these secrets will be revealed as the suspense builds. This DVD version is the original theatrical version. This is not the NBC Network version were 63 minutes of new footage was added and the sniper storyline changed. NBC also cut out some of the shooting. This original version on DVD may be okay to watch three hours before the real Super Bowl Football game in January."
4,GREAT S.W.A.T TUTORIAL,"What is there not to like about this film? Merv Griffin sings the national anthem, Joe Kapp shows why his acting career went nowhere, Howard Cosell with the play by play.TWO MINUTE WARNING was released during the decline of the disaster film craze and the start of America's (at the moment) fascination with S.W.A.T. (the TV show, 2 classic episodes of POLICE STORY, the SLA Gunfight). As a disaster film, TMW is mislabled and unfairly bashed. TMW is a mover, there are few slow spots. As a S.W.A.T tutorial, it's great. John Cassavettes as Sgt. Chris Button, is dogged, sullen, realistic. When he arrives in the sea green AMC Matador, it's a minor highlight. I would have gladly suited up and followed him and the platoon into the kill zone."
3,More than your typical diaster flick,"Two Minute Warning deals with a unknown sniper at the Super Bowl. Opening shots of a early-dawn serene L. A. and its Coliseum show thoughtfulness in Director Peerce's (Other Side of the Mountain) film about the crisscross of peoples' lives and how they are affected when events later lead to violence. Nicely acted by most of the cast in a film that tries to be more than just another disaster film from Universal (Airport, etc.) Editorial comment comes in at the ending when we never find out who the sniper is or why he does it . . . the unknown assailant in our society. Now available in DVD, this wide format film is finally presented in Letterbox so it can be viewed in its entirety as the director filmed it. The DVD transfer is excellent."
5,A Classic,"Lemmy and crew are in top form here. If you want to hear Motorhead at the height of their powers, then this is the CD to get. It is one of their top five releases in my opinion. The music is loud, fast, hard, jagged, driving and mean. From start to finish, this album will teach you what heavy metal is all about!"
5,The Dynamic Duo,"Has there ever been a better combo? This album is definitely worth the money. You all know how good it is, so I dont need to go on. Just go grab it before your boy does. I could've lived without some of the wack Eric Sermon beats on here. Next time they should only have a few guest producers, like Rockwilder and RZA. And what is LL Cool J doing on here? Go do another shark movie. He brought that song down a notch. I still give this cd 5 stars. None of that stuff can put a blemish on this Red and Meth collabo. Best album I've heard in a while. The bonus tracks are an extra gift.. the duo didnt need to give you that much. now go buy it already."
1,a WASTE of talent!,"One word...PATHETIC! ...Any true hip hop fan will agree that this is a dissapointment. Redman has never matched his classic album ""dare iz a darkside"" and Meth has already released a useless second album. The beats are the worst Erick Sermon beats ever. Red and Meth do however throw some good ryhmes. A waste of money. GO AND GET !DJ QUIKS! ALBUMS AND !FROSTS! ALBUMS IF YOU WANT SOME REAL HIP HOP."
1,I hope the next one is better,"About 3/4 of this book takes place during the same time frame that Winter's Heart ended. It is extremely slow-moving, repetitve, and even boring at times. I will finish the series because I am almost done. But, if the next one is anything like this one, I may just quit. There is very precious little in this book that would pull me back for more. I can only hope that the next book picks up the pace...big time.Aes Sedai are annoying."
5,Excellent Impact Socket Set for Car Tire Work,"This Ingersoll Rand impact socket set is great for removal/install of car and light truck wheels. I use them with an air impact wrench, a 1/2 breaker bar, and a torque wrench for the yearly switch between winter and all-weather tires/wheels. I need to switch easily between the Metric and inch sockets as the car comes with OEM metric lug nuts and the after-market lug nuts I use in the winter are inch size.The sockets and the extension rod are extremely high quality and the markings on the sockets are very nicely engraved and marked. The plastic case is very nice and makes for neat storage and easy to find."
5,The Power is Within You,"I believe this book could help most people, mentality & physically with problems that life seems to throw at each of us..."
3,cds the power is with in you,im not the best reader so i love the cds are good for me.yar i find them helpfull im doing an afla brain training 4 day training thing and im hoping to amplify the afamtions louise talks about but like she says if you get one thing out of each cd you are doing well thow i have gotten more then one thing out of them im still lisioning to them every night as you realy need to hear it all more then once what i do recomend is that for any one gatting these to lison to the first one for a few times before moving on to next cd as its lots to take in but all helpfull .thank you louise your great like isaid i carnt read good but i do try to read your book how to heal you life and its the best you a great person keep it up
2,The build quality is not there with this one.,"I purchased a pair of headlights. I wondered why I had to purchase the left and right headlight from different suppliers, but I did at the time of my purchase. The right side went in fine and works fine. The left side when in fine, but when turned the lights on at night I got these odd shadows in the lit area of the light path. At first I thought the alignment was off, so I adjusted it, but still got the shadows. It looks as though the mirrors behind the bulb are just a little off and leaves gaps in the light path."
5,This song rocks,"This band from Australia can be compared to Limp Bizkit, Deftones, Disturbed, Linkin Park etc. They are not that publicly known but this song rocks. With an awesome guitar riff for the intro the song then goes into a deep hypnotic guitar riff for the chorus, then dies down and gets into the climax of the song which is heavy. If you like heavy then this is for you."
4,Smooth Grooves,"Ishii progresses with his clean cut Techno style buy adding a variety of different sounds via Talvin Singh, DJ Spooky, Co-Fusion and Deckwreaka. The basis is still very much in the techno school with the extra sounds showing intelligent innovation. The extra 3"" Cd has two nice tracks if you feel like splashing out the extra Cash."
4,Poor English translation does not match Schopenhauer's.,"Unfortunately - I must say the English translation is poorly done. Although I figured that it might not match the quality of the German translation Schopenhauer's (please note that the only reason for Schopenhauer to learn Spanish was to translate this book), the craftmanship is still quite dissapointing. I believe that it could have been done a lot better."
2,Sadly inadequate,"Vanguard Visionaries is an extraordinarily disappointing series. The label has an excellent roster. If they wanted to publicise their archives, they could have been a great deal more generous at this price - or else offered it for $6 or so. It's also disappointing that Vanguard is ignoring some of the wonderful stuff in its archives (including Joan Baez in Italy and Joan Baez Live in Japan - and focusing instead on meaningless releases of this variety - the ""greatest hits"" by the same artists, on the same label, are a much better deal."
3,Mediocre,"This is only a mediocre book on leadership principles which will supposedly make any ministry effective. While much of what is shared in the book is useful, there is nothing here to guide someone who is hungry to see what only God can do in ministry. Conspicuously absent are clear directions on how to deliberately build a church or ministry on the gospel of Christ. Much better is Mark Dever's book The Deliberate Church (see my review)."
4,How I spent the millennium-eve,"I laughed, I cried, it became a part of me...all those Tammys and their adventures made for some fine entertainment on the last day of the 20th century, depending on if you're a computer wonk or not, and I am not. I started reading and just could not be compelled to stop--well, maybe if offered some ""Oh God"" pie I might have. Growing up in Mississippi is not essential to one's enjoyment of this book, but I am sure it helps--the food for grieving chapter brought back such fond memories of my own mama. I may be the person who introduces ""Come Back Sauce"" to Key West, Florida--we've got lots of ""queens"" here, if you know what I mean. Buy it--read it--and share it with a friend!"
5,So funny!,"This series of books, makes me laugh out loud!I take it with me, and steal time to read it whenever I can!"
3,Fun read for grim times,"Oh, my gosh. I am the Sweet Potato Queen, a born and bred Southern woman who has always secretly longed for a tiara.Perhaps you are, too?A fun read for these grim times."
1,not impressed,"while i had a few chuckles, this is a book to titilate the guys and a few straight girls who don't get out much. with all the hype, i expected more. disappointed."
5,The Queens are my Idols!,"Yippee! This is the funniest book I have ever read. No one can write and become your best friend like Jill Conner Browne. I really missed her after I finished the book....missed the other Tammys too. This is a book that draws you inside and you want to stay. A group of us are so excited about these Sweet Potato Queens, that we are going to Jackson and marching in the parade! Our policy is to spread the word about the book and insist that the next person buy it...making sure that Jill and her fabulously fuuny book become household words. Grab your favorite girlfriends and have a royal hoot with this. Cannot wait for another book by Jill. I'll buy anything she writes."
5,Start here...,"This is the first installment in ""The Sweet Potato Queens"" series by Jill Conner Browne. I have not laughed this hard since I first discovered Louis Grizzard. While lolling about, my best friend and I love to read this book aloud to each other!!! True story: I 'lost' my first copy so I purchased another. After being MIA for a year my first copy resurfaced and I still won't let ANYONE borrow it. Instead, if I want someone to enjoy this book I buy them one of their own. It's as if Miss Browne has been inside my head and/or heard some of my conversations! After reading this first installment you will crawl outta your brain to read the next. This author is intelligent and expresses so much logical truth. This book is the ""southern"" book for all women."
3,God Save the Sweet Potato Queens,"If you're not sure which Jill Connor Browne book to buy, I suggest skipping this one. I purchased all three and found The Sweet Potato Queen's Book of Love and The Sweet Potato Queens Big..Cookbook and Financial Planner basically covered the same material in book two (except for one hilarious chapter on how to please a man with one's mouth.) If you want a hilarious book about wacky women uniting for fun and loving men-bashing, buy Browne's first book. If you're over 40 and interested in the same issues, plus aging concerns and irritations, buy the third book for even more grins. All of the recipes from books one and two-- which are decadently sweet and super-caloric -- are repeated in this last book. These books are excellent gift-givers for young and old friends. Browne can provide anyone who needs a good laugh with much saucy southern irreverance and brutal, oh-my-god, honesty. You'll love her!"
2,"cute, but childish","The Sweet Potato Queens, for anyone who hasn't yet heard of them, are a group of fading Southern belles who've annointed themselves Queens of their small circle of admirers. In this book, their leader espouses the Queens' views on (primarily) Queendom, gender relations, and food.""The Sweet Potato Queens' Book of Love"" is entertaining and a quick read. However, its attitude of postfeminist dominance is grating: the Queens espouse - seriously or not - the belief that they, as women, are the intellectual equal of any man, but are still entitled to the deference accorded to women by less enlightened schools of thought. Their demands for homage grow tiresome, even from the point of view of a feminist, and by the end of the book the author's message (""worship me! worship me!"") has grown stale. This is strictly a Friday-night read, and not an excellent one at that."
1,Not Very Impressed With The Tammys...,"All these good reviews make me think that the Tammys have been doing some writing of their own. I found this book to be boring and a little pretentious (o.k. alot). I became tired of all the fabrication and the delusions of gradeur. Not the worst book I have ever read, but close."
5,funniest book ever,Quick! Someone give me a gold pen so that I can fill in the other half of that 5th star on the ratings. Not only does this book deserve the full five but I might draw in 5 extra stars. It has to be the funniest book I've ever read. Buy it now!
5,I laughed 'til I cried!!,"Another fast summer read!! I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book and can't wait to try out Miss Tammy's recipes! I wished that I had read this two years ago when it was first published. I think it definitely has changed some of my attitudes! In fact, tomorrow I am going to have breakfast at a new place on indy's westside. (It looks outrageous-colorwise and the fact that there are fake palm trees.) Anyway, it has motorcycle parking. Not that I am into cyclists but it sure can spice up some conversations for the day! Shortly, I will head out to the local ""upscale"" bookstore to pick up Miss Browne's second book. Yes, I called ahead and they are holding one for me. Meanwhile, on my way home, I will pick up ingredients for the Butterfinger cookie recipe. YUM!!! For laughs and curiosities if you have always played by THE GOOD GIRLS RULES, get a copy of the SWEET POTATO QUEENS-BOOK OF LOVE!!! Enjoy!"
1,Fat Bottomed Girls Make The Rockin' World Go Down,"Hey Ladies! I personally did not enjoy this book, because I do not like reading about loose, divorced, bitter women. Just a thought-- It made me thankful though, that I am not a wannabe or a queen. I do not like to follow suit with ANYBODY, especially these women. I may have to drive to Mississippi and see what all the fuss is about first hand."
2,reguires drilling,"I thought these had pre-drilled holes, but they don't. You have to remove the tire to drill into the fender, therefore i didn't bother installing them."
4,A Very Helpful Guide...,"Although I have not yet moved to London I have plans to do so in the near future. This book goes through all the steps of finding a place to live, finding work, choosing a school for your children, and how to get around the city. Especially helpful is the section in the book that describes in detail the different areas in London including information on housing costs, crime rates, schools etc. This book really is a survival handbook and I expect that I will be more confident in moving to London after reading this book."
5,Very nice!,"I purchased this as a gift for my wife. She never used Dolce & Gabana before, but she loves it. It is not overbearing and has just the right tones. Long lasting too!"
3,another good book by Lynsay Sands,"I have now read all but three of Lynsay Sands books and I must say I've enjoyed them all. They are filled with humor and passion. The heros are strong yet caring and gentle. The heroines are spunky, willful, almost modern in thier self reliance. The combo of the two makes for great stories. I would recommend any of her books. You'll love them."
2,More harm than good?,"I got this because my back hurt from always bending over to see the screen, but after a while of using this my wrists started to hurt. I am pretty sure this item causes, or at least, aids in, developing carpel tunnel. I didn't think about it before but having your wrists sitting up high out of alignment with your forearm is awful for them. The product itself is fine- but I think it is really only to be used with an additional keyboard and mouse that sit on the actual table."
4,"Great stand, though I had a similar issue","I use this stand on a daily basis, and though my laptop eventually started to slide, I read in the instructions that I needed to clean the pads to rid them of dust and debris that can build up causing this. Now I do it every month and my laptop doesn't budge."
2,Slip sliding away,"I got this product for my 15"" Mac Book pro and was initially thrilled as it is a nice looking product that keeps the computer elevated at an excellent angle. But after about 4 months, I noticed the computer would start to slip down the stand, that the grip pads were not holding the computer anymore. Maybe the heat from the laptop melted the grip on the pads or something. After the computer slid all the off and hit my desk one night I just threw the stand away."
5,Touching movie,The movie is a really touching one in a way they bring up the cubs with so much love. And they way the cubs reciprocated their love was something amazing...
3,"Well written, but not much fun","Kingsley Amis's clever alternative fiction novel, ""The Alteration"" is equal parts disturbing and engaging. The world of the novel is one in which the reformation never took place and in which the church and the state remained closely intertwined and corrupt. Amis's deft and creative imagining of such a world is offset by his signature dark satire and the overall pessimistic tone out of which the characters of the novel are unable and indeed ultimately unwilling to escape. The story centers around Hubert a pre-adolescent choir boy whose exquisite singing voice the church leaders intend to preserve through his ""alteration,"" the euphemism used throughout the book for his impending castration. While I recognize the craft of the artist in creating this story, I did not enjoy the reading of it. However if you like dark distopia novels this would be a great book to add to your reading list."
3,Good Dinner Jazz!!,"I've been alerted to another Smooth Jazz musician from Eastern Europe. Igor is originally from Moscow, Russia. He started playing the saxophone as a teenager and developed his craft from the Conservatorium of Music in Russia. After much accolades in his native country, he immigrated to Australia with his wife and son and is enjoying much musical success. This CD is right out of the Kenny G school of Saxophone playing. Igor music is crisp and refreshing. I enjoyed the smooth sound of the tracks, ""Luna Latina"", ""First Romance"" and ""Flying Home"". This is recommended if you have a dinner party or a light get together. It's an impressive recording!"
1,Cluttered Web-Site results in mistaken purchase,I was looking for books by Sue Grafton. The Amazon web-site has gotten so cluttered that I mistakenly bought a verion of her book simplified for students learning to read English. The picture now showing in my screen is the full version--NOT the simplified version. I don't think I will be buyiing books from Amazon unless you get rid of some of the clutter.
4,"""K"" is for Killer","I have enjoyed all the Alphabet Mysteries and this one is also, top notch...Love them. She has a good balance for description and intrigue."
1,not believable,"Poorly written, failed to describe important detail. I won't read another of her books again. The ending had no climax but a lot of dullness."
2,Disapointing ending - not up to Grafton's standards,"I love Sue Grafton's Kinsey Millhone - and I enjoyed this book right up to the end - but the end left lots of unanswered questions and loose ends. The killer of the first murder victim was identified (and the fate of the killer was indicated), but what was the motive? There were two distinct different possibilities. Also, the reader might reasonably think that this killer was also responsible for the second murder (although that was never revealed), but what about the third attack and resulting death? There was no explanation, or motive given - and no indication that the same killer was responsible. Grafton is a great writer - if she had just written 4 or 5 more pages to resolve the unanswered questions, it could have been a good book instead of a very disapointing one."
4,"A dark comedy, witty, fast paced, a real page turner.","Kinsey finds herself taking a new case- the death of a beautiful, young woaman named Lorna Kepler. The death occurred almost a year before her mother asks for Kinseys' assistance, and the ""trail"" is certainly not hot, but she offers to take a look around. The mother hands Kinsey a video, believing it has something to do with her daughter death. The movie is ""pure smut"" as the mother describes it. She travels to many places to uncover the truth, and when the truth finally is revealed, it makes some unexpected truths."
3,broilmaster cover,"Was dissapointed. It's an ugly cover, the ""broilmaster"" logo is on an over enlarged white background with black lettering. Not at all like the image which is white lettering on black. The Log is very obtrusive, so big and also on the back side as well. Can't even have one side as all solid black. Would not recommend and it was expensive."
4,Excellent adaptation of the Christie classic..,"Although the video starring Helen Hayes (as opposed to the British version that stars Joan Hickson) uses a primarily American cast, I believe it is a more lively version and more faithful to the original story than the British effort- with crisp dialogue, shafts of humor,a nice reggae open ing theme and excellent casting (with the exception of Beth Howland who is embarrassingly inadequate and clumsy in her portrayal of the cheated-on Evelyn Hillingdon). I usually prefer BBC productions of Christie's works, but this American version is a glowing exception (the BBC films drags slower than winter molasses, and none of the cast have the verve and energy of their American counterparts). Helen Hayes even attempts an English accent here and there, and even though she doesn't carry it off, her busybody Miss Marple is a delight, anyway (admirably supported by Barnard Hughes). And Swoosie Kurtz is a riot as Hughes' gossipy secretary. ENJOY. (Signed) DAN/L.P."
5,a brilliant tale with a huge payoff,"what has been created by sabina murray here is not a typical cannibal horror novel; rather, by constructing a story of carefully constructed words, literate imagery, and a paced and controlled plot structure, ""a carnivore's inquiry"" is actually a high-end literary work with a grotesquely graphic centerpoint: cannibalism.i can see how many feel the book is too slow, or perhaps not graphic enough, in the same way watching a psychological thriller won't offer the same payoff to someone expecting a slasher film. be assured: pour over this work. drink the language, and you'll find your mind becomes a haunted world in sabina murray's hands."
2,It's too small to see easily.,"After I read the reviews, I boought it anyhow. Yes, it does not sit flat enouogh to read without picking it up.At least I can pick it up to look at and read. The display is clear and bright enough to read."
2,Will not stick!,"The adhesive came apart within a couple of months. On the upside, it does keep time, and was certainly cheap enough."
1,fiber content,How can we make an intellegent purchase on this site when they fail to give what the fabric is made of. This is primary information and should be included on ALL clothing listed on this site. This is not the first time TODAY I have seen this on Amazon.com
1,A Weakness,"This book is a novel about the making of America from 13 nation-states. It is a well thought through reconstruction of the years in which our founder's of the nation help shape the United States into what it is now. This book is hard to understand and follow. I would recommend this book to someone with a strong history background. Otherwise, unless it is an assignment, I doubt it help you understand US history any better."
2,Poor graphic quality ruins a useful book,The poor quality of graphics in this print relegates the intelligibility of this book to near zero. A number of ideas in cat set-up are explained in photos and diagrams which are rendered in low resolution.I expect more from a text (e.g. catamaran racing for the 90's)
5,I was shocked!!,"The first song I had ever heard by Liz Phair I heard at a friends house, turning Japenese from Juvinilia, i thought she was going to be full of remakes and barley any songs of her own! But i was wrong, this debut album is up there with the debuts of Tori Amos and Ani Difranco!!"
5,The absolutely best Liz Phair,"I've heard 95% of all Liz Phair's music, and this CD is by far the best. I couldn't take it out of my CD player for weeks, it's deep, powerful, and laced with feminist inspiration. Definately a keeper."
5,Before she sold out,Liz Phair started out with a collection of edgy songs with steel lyrics and inventive melodies. The words that she expresses in this album are so tortured and true in many respects. This is a classic cd that works its way back into circulation often. She does not sound like the same artist who put out the more recent junk.
5,"Holy cow, I'm in high school again!","Admission: I played this album nonstop my entire senior year in high school (with a bit of the sundays and lush mixed in). Liz gets high strung chick-dom down pat, and now when I pop this puppy in while running errands, I'm taking turns and zooming into parking spaces like the undercover rebel Liz and I secretly recognize me to be. As a wily 17 year old, I scrawled the lyrics to ""Flower"" onto my notebook and pointedly made sure the grrl who sat next to me saw them (I didn't like her too much) ... now, I sing ""@#ck and Run"" at the top of my lungs with a glimmer in my eye and a teeny tiny yearning in my heart to be that freewheeling, freespirited gal I used to be before this thing called the 401(K).The album is phat. You'll wonder how you lived without it!"
2,I Love both Ani and Utah but...,"I bought this album after buying ""Fellow Workers"" another collaboration between Utah and Ani. It has been a drive to work staple for some 9 months. I was expecting more of the same. But I found the only way to actually hear Utah's words which are why I bought this collection was to roll the bass completely off and boost the mid range up. Even so the electronic music seemed to bear no relationship to what Utah was doing.I would have much preferred Utah doing this material by himself or with perhaps another acoustic musician or two behind him instead of all the synth sounds."
5,There's a reason Norm uses Bessey clamps,"If you watch ""The New Yankee Workshop"", you'll notice Norm always grabs the Bessey clamps when it's time to start gluing. That's because they are the best. If you do a lot of woodworking that requires gluing panels together, you owe it to yourself to invest in a set of these."
3,audiobook version,"After reading ""Cloud of Sparrows"" I was quite captivated and couldn't wait to read ""Autumn Bridge"". So much so that I downloaded the audioversion so that I could listen at times when I wouldnt have the chance to read. Seemed like a good idea at the time but I found myself cringing after every other line because of the way the Japanese names were pronounced. If only the narrator had been given a little more insight, I might have been saved the pain while I tried to enjo the novel!"
3,Disappointed,"I was expecting it to be closer to 30 minutes than 20, and they only went through 6 colors. It's definitely not the best Baby Einstein dvd. My kids seem to enjoy the animal ones better. The puppet shows and songs are their favorite parts, but this one doesn't have as much of that."
3,Not as good as we expect,"Comparing with other Baby Einstein series videos,this one is just ok. It really needs some ""meat"". Just showing some puppets and paintings of Van Gogh is not enough. This is the worst of the series."
1,baby will speak slowly be careful,"My son is now 1 year and 11 month old, from his very early time, about 3~4 month old, we began to introduce Baby Einstein series to him. He could not without the shows later, averagely watch 3~4 hrs per day. Now he is nearly two years old, but could not even speak out 6~8 words, much late than my friend's son (the same age), my brother's daughter and my sister's son (compare them at the same age). I become to suspect if the Baby Einstein shows do benifit younger babies. The shows seldom speak, mostly music or silence. I really regret that my son spend too much (one and half year) on Baby Einstein. listein to me, talk with you baby, NOT let the Baby Einstein do that."
3,Discordant noises and music ruin it,"If you've seen Baby Einstein's Old MacDonald, you know how great these videos can be. Unfortunately, this one is a disappointment. My 1-year-old isn't very interested, the learning value is minimal, and the discordant noises and music ruin it."
3,If only...,"This dvd is entertaining enough that my 8 month old watches it. He loves the puppets and laughs at them. However, for the rest of the family, viewing this dvd can be painful. This is due to the so-called ""poems"" which introduce the colors. Green slithers in to make me cool? Purple makes me want to paint my face? Whatever happened to comparing colors to things children recognize like frogs and grapes? The dvd would be 5 star if not for the sad attempt at poetry. If you can bear to listen to annoyingly bad poetry every few minutes, I recommend this dvd. After all, it is for the kids not us."
5,age limits do not apply,"I bought the Baby Galileo first, since it was all that my Wal-Mart had, then I came to Amazon and bought this one, as well as Baby Bach and Baby Mozart. Of all of the 4 that we have so far, Baby Van Gogh is my daughter's favorite. She screams with glee when ""Van Goat"" appears on the screen. I have been showing this video to her since she was 2 months old, regardless of the ""recommended"" age of the videos, and she is completely encaptured by them all, but this one in particular. I have ordered 4 more titles, and I hope to get the other accessories for my daughter so we can have more family interraction time."
4,captivating,"its amazing -this one holds my baby's attention liek a chjarm, while baby bach does not at all. so in my opinio this is a great dvd, with a nice pace and great colors. and happily there is more ethnic diversity in this one as well."
4,An excellent series,"Well, to be frank, I prefer Baby Mozart as well -- but my 1-year-old daughter is even more enraptured by Van Gogh than by Mozart. When she hears the opening music, she comes from anywhere in the house, and plunks right down. I have to admit that I find it rather soothing, and enjoy watching it with her. She is becoming aware that we have a print in the den that is pictured in the video. She thinks that's pretty cool..."
5,i really enjoyed this CD.,I really enjoyed all the songs on the CD and think that even as I listen to it for the hundreth time i find it amazing.
5,Very good product,"I cannot tell this ink from the ink recommended by the manufacturer. My printer cannot tell the difference either. I never had any problems with any of the cartridges, the ink on the paper or with the printer using this ink. I have been using this product for about a year."
5,CHEAP INK!!!!,"Cheap Ink! I don't do photos so cannot say about photo quality but for my everyday printing needs this works very well, the packaging is nice also.Thanks!"
4,Brother Compatibles,Was skeptical but this is a great deal. Work in printer. Print quality is good. Would recommend these to any other Brother user.
1,FAKE INK!!!,"Even on the first day, I put in the cyan color, and the printer did not print anything in yellow. Instead of the yellow color, a faint blue color would appear in its place. Terrible ink, after about 2 weeks, its saying the ink is 'near empty', which is ridiculous because the other ink lasts me atleast 6-8 months."
5,Wonderful Product!!!,I was very surprised to see how great this product worked. I can't tell the difference between this ink cartridge and Brothers ink cartridge. I will be ordering again.
1,Crap,These cartridges are like 5% full and don't really work with the printer. When you pay 25% the normal retail of ink I guess you shouldn't expect anything more than that though.
1,not adequate as an LC-51 Replacement,This product (black) caused the color ink function on two Brother printers to stop functioning. Only black will print now.
2,Laser Parking System,"The laser turns off before I can finish parking. The battery drained after approximately a week.The laser can't be locked in a stable position. It is really a poorly designed ""system""."
2,NOT TIFFEN!!!,Beware these are not Tiffen branded lens shades but ordinary Adorama brand lens shades. Adorama please update this listing.
3,Mildly entertaining band,"While DoubleDrive is no longer around, this cd is an average one to add to your collection. It has its ups and downs, as most cd's do from bands that had short lifespans, but in this case the ups are slightly better than the downs.1000 Yard Stare has some good strength to its songs, with some good work on the guitar that makes some of the songs catchy.While definitely not a great band or a must-have, the download of the cd is pretty cheap and it is something to listen to from the '90's that wasn't the typical trashy grunge rock everyone was listening to."
5,doubledrive-excellent!,"I heard of this band about a year ago. I got a cd sampler from the Hard Rock cafe and they happened to be on it. I listened to the song a million times and even figured it out on my guitar. So I looked for the cd for about three months and couldn't find it. Then I went to a record store and i found it and bought it. My 5 favorite songs off the record are: ""Belief System,"" ""1,000 yard stare,"" ""Hell,"" ""Vamp,"" and ""Reason."" My only complaint about the cd is after the song ""Stand By"" There's about 76 tracks of silence before the hidden track. Is still a great cd though."
2,doesn't hold up to persistent cats...,"Our cat broke through this door the first night we used it.The plastic locking tabs simply couldn't hold up to a persistent 9lb cat, who simply pushed his nose into the bottom of the tab for a good 10 minutes until the tabs just snapped off.We're replacing the door with a model that uses a panel to block the door, rather than flimsy plastic tabs."
5,Bessey clamps superior,"I'm not a pro but I am an advanced amateur and these Bessey clamps are simply the best I've ever used. The jaws remain parallel to each other so you're less likely to ""buckle"" your work and the tightening handle allows for better torque than the thumb-screw style clamps. I use these clamps for my best work. I wish I had dozens."
4,Good printer and good service.,"The first unit that we received failed after 3 days. Fortunately, a quick call to Dymo's support line had a replacement printer to us in just a few days. So far it's working as advertised.I wish the printer had an on/off switch. This unit is always on. If you have to reset the printer, which we did several times when the first one failed, you must pull the power plug. The power plug is very inconvenient to access."
4,Decent hardware and software,"Unit works relatively well, I had to run the installer a number of times to get it to work correctly on Windows Vista. The software seems fine and indicates it is supported on the Dymo site, but the installer is antiquated and needs help. Once I finally got it installed it works fine."
3,Another addition to an excellent collection...,"Dave Seaman is probably the hottest DJ in the world right now (I know I'll get shouted down for this comment). This collection shows a move to a more mellow selection of tunes. It takes a few listens but once you get there you'll find that everything hangs together very nicely. Favourite track: Meeker - Save Me (For anyone who's ever been in a bad relationship)""Music is the answer to your problems"""
5,Ani is amazing LIVE,"I love this album. ANI is so amazing live, much more so than she is on her studio albums. Aside from her live energy, the best part of having this album is having updated versions of her songs from her first few albums. I recommend this album to any Ani fan in a heartbeat. This album is so great... it plays tricks with the eye."
5,Live-Action Ani,"If you are an Ani fan this is a must have CD to have in your collection. Though it isn't my first, or maybe not my favorite, I say that it is a must have. I have never seen her in concert (though I plan to), but I can fully picture what she would be like. I think that this cd embodies the live sound that she has cultivated throughout her career, and shows her talent unlike no other."
5,ahhhhhhhh....the albumn is like a drug,"i used to work at the beacon theatre in nyc, where a few of the tracks on this albumn were recorded. that was the first time i had heard of her, and at the time i thought she was just another whiny man-hater. well, she is, but i first heard this albumn 3 years ago and i've played it at least once a week since. it's amazing, there's nothing like it. now i've seen her 5 times on 2 continents, and i have every albumn, mostly out of curiosity. but this is BY FAR her best work, as is any live music she produces at any show. for some reason, she is lackluster in the studio. just buy this albumn, and don't worry about any of the studio ones. she can completely change her voice with every song, and she sounds so beautiful you won't even mind the political ramblings."
5,Wonderfully illustrates how good she is live!,"This album, full of cuts hidden songs and Ani talking, beautifull ilustrates the performer she is. Key songs include Gravel, Napoleon, Both ands with the Buffalo Philharmonic, and Out of Range. Ani talking with drummer Andy Stochansky is hilarious. One of my all time favorite albums and the best live album ever. Thank you Ani and keep on singing."
5,Toggle clamps,The product construction is of high quality and functions as advertised. I would recommend this product to wood workers. It would be nice if it was designed to work with a track system instead of screws and a support board. Overall great product.
2,Ladies Converse Comments,"I love the look of Converse sneakers and have purchased them in the past. I do feel that for the price I paid I was expecting a higher quality of these Converse, vs. the ones I bought at Target for less than $20.00.I was hoping that for over $60.00, these Converse would have a better made insole with arch support and the canvas used on the sneaker was also very flimsy compared to my other Converse's ( even from Target ). Also - I ordered a half size down from my normal size ( as requested by the seller ) , they were still a bit to large.I like the look of these shoes but would not purchase another at this price."
2,NO LACES?!?!?,"I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT!! MY SON OPENED THE BOX OF SHOES TO FIND THE SHOES CAME WITH NO LACES!! HE WAS SO UPSET THAT HE WASN'T ABLE TO WEAR THEM RIGHT AWAY, BECAUSE IT WAS DEC. 24 EVERYTHING WAS ALREADY CLOSED AND NOTHING WOULD BE OPEN UNTIL DEC. 26, AND WHY SHOULD WE HAVE TO PAY FOR SHOE LACES??? I'M GLAD YOU SENT ME THE E MAIL, BECAUSE I'D LIKE TO SEND THE SHOES BACK!! WE WERE ABLE TO FIND A BRAND NEW PAIR (WITH LACES) AT A BETTER PRICE."
1,Came to me already ripped in two places,These came as advertised and in a timely manner. What I didn't like was the tear in the elastic band (which functionally replaces shoelaces) on the right shoe. This causes the my right heel to come out of the shoe when I walk simply because the shoe is not tight enough. There is also a tear in the piece of canvas on the left shoe that holds the grommets. When I walk the hole opens up on the side of my foot.I'm wearing these because I'm in Afghanistan and have no other sneakers to use until the replacement set I ordered from another vendor arrives. Returning these would not be practical as it involved significant bother and cost using the military postal system. If the vendor had sent a non-defective pair of sneakers in the first place there would be no reason for this bad review.
2,converse,I had to return my first pair of converse because the size was wrong. I resent that I had to pay to ship them back as this is the third pair of shoes I had to pay to return. The new pair fit fine
2,This NOT the 2012 Penguin publication,"The Kindle edition I got is a Signet book, and the update is from 1989. Not sure if there's a difference in the Penguin paperback (pictured as the ""cover"" for this book) which is supposed to be available on Sept 5th. Kindle is really a crappy way to compare books..."
2,"A fraud, but not perhaps a deliberate one.","Sorry, kiddies and students, but McGinniss really is a distasteful, publicity-grubbing worm. The more I look into this case, including personal interviews, the more I realize just how unethical McGinniss really was, and still is. The forensic case doesn't add up, and never, ever did.By the way, anyone who would ever take a polygraph test under any circumstances is definitely a fool. BUT NOT NECESSARILY A MURDERER. I would never take one under any circumstance, no matter what.Then again, unlike many who apparently get their information from Montel Williams and Maury Povich, I've actually done my research about the technology."
4,Answers why?,Do you want to know how and why Jeffrey MacDonald could have brutally murdered his family? Fatal Vision offers a compelling and fascinating theory.
3,One sided review of facts,"I was kind of disappointed in this book. It reads well and is detailed in its point of view. However, as I was reading it I kept wondering ""where is the oppisite point of view. If this is supposed to be and unbiased account of the events, it fails in that reguard..."
1,Look to other artist for real Blues,"Sadly this is the type of stuff that passes as blues in Australia. Slick and over produced pop music pretending to be blues.Having been a blues fan for years now I am very frustrated with albums like this, you are always left felling let down. One does not find a direct and honest form of expression, as one finds with the music of say Lightnin' Hopkins, Son House and other blues greats, but rather music that is set to show-off a person and heavily padded to give that ""full sound"".Having seen Mr Lang live I can only say there are far better Blues singers and players out there.I would suggest that you look at the many great bluesman Amazon has to offer like, Muddy Waters, Robert Pete Williams, Fred Mcdowell eta. and see what I mean."
1,I'd give it 0 stars if I could,"This product is much too difficult to use. I can barely make the clamp open using two hands because the spring is SO STRONG. That makes it worthless for me. My husband agreed that they were much too strong for a woman to be able to use, yet I found nothing in the listing for this item to indicate this issue. I am returning them!"
3,Amazon shipping problem,"I ordered 4 of these clamps 3 days ago and they arrived in 4 large separate boxes filled with pillows. One clamp had the small plastic tail piece broken. The clamps are great but the way Amazon ships is ludicrous. I think every one in the shipping department needs to see ""An Inconveinent Truth"". What a waste of resources! I could have received all the clamps in one box with the same result. I have ordered my last clamp from Amazon."
3,worth it,"but only if you must own every single ani album or really like the song joyful girl.this disk is just a bunch or remixes of joyful girl. it does, however, contain a beautiful and amazing version of both hands which is one of my favorite ani songs. this made it worth it to me, but this was also during a time where i was paying lots of money for ani bootlegs. that day in my life has passed and this cd doesn't get much play anymore, certainly not the air time that her other albums do."
2,Really not that good,"Try ""Sex Tonight"" or ""Shake Your Money Maker,"" (read my review on it though) instead. The people that are saying mean things about her are probably just the people who hate her music. I would listen to the sound samples before buying this CD, as there was really nothing here for me."
3,To the previous reviewer,"Dude .... one lengthy scathing review was enough. Two, under two different names, is egregious. You really have it in for this gal."
5,This girl rocks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This girl kicks [rear]!!!!!!!!She'll say what she thinks with out giving a [darn] about it. Her voice is just awesome.... She has the perfect look, perfect voice, and perfect attitude. She should totally record a new album, it would go to the top of the charts.If you are thinking of buying this album, just make up your mind and buy it. Its totally awesome. If you don't buy it you will be missing out in alot of great music...."
2,"Slip, Sliding Away","Got this at a great price, but this mat is very slippery. Supposedly once you start to perspire, you'll gain some traction, but for me poses such as down-dog or any of the warrior poses, etc. were risky. I do Ashtanga, so I do usually work up a pretty good sweat. I even tried wetting it down before starting my practice, but I still never felt comfortable. I do fold it up and use it for poses such as supported shoulder-stand and plow and it looks quite nice as a meditation mat in front of my altar."
1,You can't use these for your yoga practice,"These rugs can't be used for yoga practice. I washed it, wet it prior to practice but I'm still sliding on it, especially my hands in downdog. So in my opinion this is a waste of money. It's really just a rug!"
4,Hervey in India,"I found this book a bit less interesting than the first in the series. Perhaps the pace was a lot slower. Hervey is now off to India where he finds much adventure, an a lot of Byzantine politics. The political world of India in the early 19th century is well portrayed. One can see where the Empire played such a vital role in protecting the country from brigends. The story developes slowly in this volume, as Malinson writes more in the style of Patrick O'Brien. Here we get lots of tips on how to maintain cavalry horses and the like. Perhaps a bit tedious at times, but character building nonetheless.The action is smaller scaled here, no more big slug-fests like Waterloo. In India Hervey finds the seductiveness of the landscape intoxicating at times. He learns to think on his feet and becomes adept at masterering the ""petit guerre"" of warfare in the East. This series shows promise, even if Hervey is no Sharpe, and Malinson no Cornwell."
2,Poorly Organized,"This book is almost as bad as the manual that came with my synthesizer. It is extremely poorly organized, and the author's writing style is verbose and unnecessarily technical. For example, the author's explanation of Keyboard Tracking in the Filters chapter is written backwards, with the most basic information presented last.Throughout the book, the author references a concept or term explained in a future chapter, but then continues as if that concept is understood. It's maddening!This book does not lay a foundation, is not laid out in a logical fashion, and is full references to what synths of the past could and could not do. In all, I've found it to be very difficult and boring to read.I'm sure the author is very knowledgeable about his topic, but all of this information could be MUCH better presented, in a much more logical fashion."
2,A fair introduction for musicians,"As an electronics engineer, responsible for education at university level, I was a bit disappointed after reading the book. From theoretical/technical point of view, the book starts at a very basic level. For instance phase cancellation and definition of decibels. I did not find anything that was really explained in depth. As far as I can understand, the book is not intended for technicians or engineers dealing with design and analysis of electronic music systems.On the other hand, musicians with no technical background that will mainly buy and use a synthesizer can probably find some useful information about common technical terms and buzzwords. However, from my point of view, I am not convinced this book really is The Ultimate Reference for Sound Design."
5,give props to mary,"this is the sixth album from Mary (including the live and remix albums) and she comes back stronger than ever. in past times of working with puff daddy, nas, dmx, lil' kim, the lox, odb, and george benson, mary smooths this record out with new guest such as Jadikiss, Lauryn Hill, Aretha Franklin, Elton John, Jay-Z & Faith Evans. the smooth, old school/new school beats of ""all that i can say"". the video is great and the song is too. ""sexy"" another song that features rap vocals with mary is the amazingly slick duet with Lox'z Jadakiss. throw it up to mary she'z been around for a long time and still can please her fans"
5,the best of mary,"This is the best of MARY!!! ""Your child"" is the most beautiful and significant song she's ever done! The whole second half of the CD is extraordinary!!! ""Don't Waste your Time"", "" Your child"", ""The Love I never Had""..............mary has arrived...finally music and song to match her voice!!"
3,Show me George Michael!,"I bought this CD thinking ""As"", the duet she sings with George Michael would be on it. I kept hoping I was misreading the list of songs on the jacket.That song is dynamite and WHERE IS IT? The CD, otherwise, was just okay. I don't really care for her scratchy, ""out of tune"" way of singing, but as I listen to it more and more I do find myself liking it more. ""Time"" is particularly haunting, and more than redolent of Erykah Badu in melody and vocal expression. Numbers 8 and 10 were also good. Despised ""Beautiful Ones"" and ""Not Lookin'"". She sounds off-key in her phrasing. I think Mary is someone who is an ""acquired taste"" and I'm not quite there, yet."
4,Good! But here's some criticism!,"I actually listened to this after amazon recommnded that I listen to this album. So i did and I thought it was pretty good. She's talented. I mean there's a reason that she has sold over 40 million albums. I will say that it sounded like a generic gospel album such as Mary Mary or Kirk Franklin. In that respect I will say that it wasn't as good as some of her other work. On best this album is average, she could have done better. I actually thought the last few tracks such as I thought Your child and The Love I never had. They were thought provoking and you really got to see how she really felt about growing up with haven't her parents around to much. For that i give her some props. Also there were some pretty slick beats, and most of the album relaxing to listen to. If your looking for mary j's best work look at her other albums. If you have a love for gospel music(modern day) or adult r&b then this is for you!"
5,Girl You've Done It Again! The Platnum Is On It's Way Baby!,Mary this is it girl! Ilove your new CD I couldn't wait until it hit the stores You are an artist who's music I will always buy regardless. Keep doing your thang.
5,"Mary, please keep the music coming","I really enjoyed almost every song on your new album. I have no doubt that your music comes from your heart, or should I say within your soul. Keep the music coming, Mary"
5,The Queen of Hip Hop and Soul,I really liked this CD. It is the best CD she has ever come out with. I love the duet with K-Ci.
3,Kudos to Ray Winstone,"This film is stylish, edgy, and self-important. Nonetheless -- Ben Kingsley as the psychopathic gangster Don Logan is over-rated; his upstaging of the other actors is unnerving and annoying, but, thankfully, he doesn't completely get away with it. For Ray Winstone is perfectly cast and absolutely brilliant and so overshadows Kingsley even for viewers not quite aware of the feat, as does Ian McShane, whose genial laughter is beyond scary.Cinematographically daring and interesting, this is a visually memorable film. It also has many surprising and subtle touches in its portrayal of character, for instance in the tender avuncular relationship between Gal and Enrique, and in the deep love that binds Gal to his ex-porn-star wife, played magnificently by Amanda Redman. Despite its virtues, however, ""Sexy Beast"" is weakly plotted. Too much time is spent developing scenes that are tangential to the film's real energy. Its reach is longer than its grasp"
2,Somebody shoot this guy already...,I gave this movie 2 stars only for the fact that I could see it might have been better if Ben Kingsley's character wasn't in the movie. For 45 minutes I watched a pathetic excuse of a gangster go on a tyrade of verbal and physical abuse with everyone around him until I could bare no more. I had to turn it off before I fell asleep....this movie was amazingly boring and very unbelievable...no one could endure Kingsley's character as long as the characters in this movie...I know I didn't.
3,A little too slow for the MTV generation,"This movie had some great things going for it, but took a little too long to get where it wanted to go. Worth watching for some discrete reasons (fell in love with the house and the Spanish countryside; Kingsley was extremely entertaining) but overall a little boring in the middle."
2,"Stink,stank,stunk","My goodness the British can't make movies. They can write, they can act, they make great music but cinema isn't their speciality. They've been trying to make a Terentino(?) film for the past decade (see Guy Richie) and have failed miserably every bloody time. They got Lean and Hitchcock, though Hitchcock didn't become great until he came to the states, outside of these two it's a pretty sad affair. I gave it 2 stars instead of one out of respect for Ben Kingsley."
2,Not Everything I Heard,"I felt misled by the many reviews when I watched this movie. I give it 2 stars strictly based on Ben Kingsley's performance, which was excellent. Without his performance as the no-nonesense gangster this movie would have failed miserably. I felt the movie quirky and mostly dull.Most of the movie revolves around a few retired gangsters that are trying to avoid being pulled back in by the dominating character that Kingsley portrays. While there are a few moments of interest overall it fails. I would recommend ""The Suicide Kings"" before this movie if you are looking at off beat movies about gangsters and friends.In the end it left me dissatisfied."
4,Hard time understanding wtf they're saying in Snatch? This isn't as bad..,"First off, this is not a deep, philosophical movie. It is a stylish, fun movie with notable performances and gangster drama...It paints a pretty picture of a cool, retired guy in love and what he has to deal with because of a jack@ss he used to know in the thieving business...Unique elements to this movie; worth watching at least once. :) I personally didn't find the material too cliche or overdone... but that's just me...I enjoyed it. :PActual rating is 3.5.. but for Amazon, I'll tip it to a 4 instead of a 3 due to overzealous crabs tossing out 1 stars."
4,Ben Kingsley,"Ben Kingsley creates in Don Logan a psychotic criminal of violent moodiness, delusion and sly malice; there is danger even in the way he offers to pay for someone else's dinner. The writing is darkly funny though ferocious and spare (friends of mine and I have taken to quoting Don: ""No no no no no no no no no!""). In fact in all its portrayals the movie is brilliantly acted, and it creates an air of brutality that I can't liken to anything else I've ever seen. Don't expect much plot though--really it is just one long sustained tense situation. And although it's English, the accents are so serious you might turn the subtitles on."
4,A Masterpiece in Dark Humor,"This movie is a must see! Kingsley's snarling performance alone deserves an academy. The movie takes place with Gal relaxing beside his pool in his Spanish Villa. A boulder comes tumbling down and nearly kills him. Then what comes at him next... much worse that the boulder...his ex-boss (played by Ben Kingsley)who wants him to take on another ""job"". This movie is funny, scarey and one that you won't forget!"
4,"No fu**ing way, no fu**ing way, no fu**ing way!","Ben Kingsley rocks as Don Logan in this excellent heist film. Logan is a jealous, mean spirited thug who is called on to lure Gal Dove out of retirement for a big heist back in his home country merry old England. Well, Gal's just fine with his life, enjoying his free time with friends in Spain. Logan doesn't see it that way though, and seems to not understand Gal's refusal to comply. From there, it evolves into a conflict that's sure to make you rise up out of your seat. This film is very slick, stylish and hillarious. The DVD doesn't offer up much, but has a great commentary track by Kingsley. Remember subtitles, cause the dialogue is hard to understand sometimes with the thick accents, but forget about it. This one fu**ing rocks."
3,"Light use only, especially with the pads.","I liked the idea of these clamps having the same clutch grip as the heavier, excellent, 7200 series clamps, so I bought a set of four each of 12"", 18"" and 24"". However the bar bends quite a lot under heavy pressure, especially on the longer length ones. This is especially a problem when using the matching protective pads. The beam bends so much when applying hard pressure that the resulting angle produced on the fixed clamp end of the beam makes the clamp slip out of the pad and fall off the job being clamped. This is not the same problem when only applying light pressure. These clamps need to be used with that in mind then they are fine but a disappointment."
5,Excellent budget wood clamps,"You can't beat these clamps for the money. Enough pressure can be applied for glued joints without excessive flexing. Also, you can accumulate a good collection without going broke."
5,Real Deal,"An actual ""Pony"" clamp made by Jorgensen....the real deal. Made in USA, I think (but who really knows these days)."
3,Alvin and the Chipmunks review,"I really have never opened this one. I was looking for another Alvin and the Chipmunks sing along. It has a lot of good songs and is, I'm sure, just as good as the other I purchased."
1,This was an unneccessary remake of a classic horror film,"Ironically, this version of the Shining is more faithful to King's novel than the original movie was. However, this new version failed to capture the suspense and horror of the book. I heard that King was not happy with Kubric's version of the movie, particularly in Jack Nicholson's over-the-top portrayal of Jack Torrance. Yes, Nicholson took this character and made it his own, but it WORKED. The new movie features one-dimensional portrayals of these characters: where Nicholson was over the top, Webber was utterly devoid of personality. The actor who played Danny in the new version was really painful to watch as well, which did not bode well for this film.Overall, when compared to the original movie, this remake is an inferior film. When compared with the book, this remake is true to the storyline, but the acting fails to bring these characters to life."
1,"NO WAY,MAN!!!","Having attempted unsuccessfully to watch the '97 TV remake of the Shining 3 times...I finally pulled it together and caught it from start to finish. Yes...there were a few high points in the movie that may've favored the book, but with all the bad acting, bad scripting,over-editing and no Jack Nicholson, the remake didn't hold HALF a candle to the original Shining w/t Jack Nicholson. It just wasn't right...and it was too nicey-nice for my taste. Save your money. WE WANT JACK!!!!"
1,Lame,"I understand why the original didn't follow the novel, because it wouldn't be scary on screen.. there is just too much extra detail that makes this movie drag and can only be appreciated by reading the novel. The acting is horrible and the kid is annoying, what's with his mouth being open through the whole movie? This is just another poorly edited cliche made-for-tv horror movie."
2,Not even close,"This was a big mistake! The only thing this had to do with The Shinning was Stephen King's name. The characters have the same name but the story is totally off the wall. First they tried to take an hour long movie and turn it into a mini-series. It doesn't work. Second the cast is second rate compared to the first, not to say they can't act becuase they are all fine actors, they just didn't fit the roles. They replace Jack's axe with a crocket mallet and in the end he dies saving the lives he once threatened. Maybe it is just that I was such a fan of the first one that ruined this one for me, but I don't think so."
2,It was a cake walk compared to the original,"i couldnt give this one star, but The 1980 was better than this one by far shot . Im a huge Jack Nicholson fan , ever since i saw it in 1982. In this one The acting was just bad. i didnt like it. Yes it follows the book. But it wasnt scary. as matter of fact it ""was a cake walk compared to the original"" No Errie music, No Jack Nicholson, no River of blood coming from elevator. Sorry King but you shoulda left well enough alone.If not better, give me a break"
4,Stephen King's Shining,"We had just spent a couple nights at The Stanley in Estes Park, CO, so wanted to see the version of Stephen King's movie that he made -- inspired by and filmed at The Stanley. This version is more believable than the Hollywood version. Perhaps it is not quite as scary as the Hollywood movie. Both movies made me wonder what effect they had on the child actors involved."
1,A shame,"The book was good. Perhaps I am spoiled with Kubrick, but for any director to think he could make a better movie than Kubrick is crazy. The result was a trashy looking movie that, sure, it was true to the book, but it was something you would see on at three am because it just fills time. Do not buy, don't even rent."
1,pitiful,"what was King thinking. what a terrible idea. its obvious that nobody would be able to outdo Kubrik as he is truly a ""king"" as far as filmmaking is concerned. in comparison, King's version is just a mere spot of dirt on the bottom of a better man's shoe (in this case Kubrik's). this version is way too long and not nearly as dramatic...plus, how could it be successful with anyone other than Jack Nicholson as the caretaker?!?! what a shame...."
5,Better Then Kubrick's Version!,This movie is awesome and really captures the scares and creepy moments of the book suberbly and I highly recommend it to fans of Stephen King's book.The Kubrick version is a good movie but is no where near as good as the book or this version starring the guy from Wings who was in my opinion great as Jack and just as good as Jack Nicholson and I aslo think that Rebecca De Mornay was great as Wendy as was the adorable Courtland Meade as Danny.I have both movies on DVD and I like both but this one is my favorite of the two and I recommend buying both.
3,The way King wanted it to be,"Although the 1980 Kubrick classic is far superior to this one in may ways (acting, writing) this version of the novel was written by Stephen King himself, and is faithful to the novel in every way.The only things that I had a problem with were as follows:1. Some of the acting is extremely hokey...Courtland Mead was good, but they should have hired an acting coach to help him.2. Some of the dialogue was laughable...""Kissin', kissin, that's what I been missin'!"" and (Danny speaking of his mother's drawings) ""Draw good fruit!"" - among other things.Thats about it. Other than that, its a good adaptation of the book, and I enjoyed it. I actually watched this in one sitting-its LONG, clocking in at about four hours and thirty minutes, but its good.Rent it."
4,Much closer to the book than the movie,"I used to love the original movie - that was before I read the book. Once I did, I realized that the movie wasn't even remotely close to King's story and it became somewhat difficult to even watch.Enter this mini-series.I very much enjoyed it from start to finish. I realize some of the effects were somewhat silly, but I also realize the limits of a made-for-tv budget. That said, the movie followed the story King wrote almost to a ""T"". I loved the atmosphere and I thought the actors did a decent job in their parts. I'm pretty sure if I hadn't read the book first I wouldn't have enjoyed it as much as I did, but if you have read the book, do yourself a favor and give this a watch."
3,Good product and fast service,The product was what I wanted. I had to cut to fit my 2012 Jeep Grand Cherokee properly but that was done easily with a jig saw.They arrived very quick and in good condition.
5,Whoah... Keanu's band is pretty damn fantastic!,"What else is there to say?I am a big Bret Domrose fan and i love all his work. He is the main singer and guitar player in Dogstar along with Keanu Reeves on bass (but you knew that!!) and Robert Mailhouse on drums.32 Stories is beautiful, it is my favourite song.I can't get the CD rom to work, but who cares when you have four great songs?Happy Ending and Quattro Formaggi are probably best to get if you are new to this band as there are more tracks.You can get Bret's solo CD at [website]Go get it, i LOVE it."
4,"It's ""GROOVE MERCHANT"" funk...What more could you ask for?","....well they could of done without the vocal tracks (there's about 3) and they definately needed to include Richard 'Groove' Holmes . Other than that you got some of the funkiest jazz you will ever hear. Stand out tracks are Reuben Wilson-Inner City Blues, O'Donel Levy-Bad Bad Simba, Jimmy McGriff-Fat Cakes and Ramon Morris-First Come, First Served. Funky! Funky! stuff throughout. Not a bad addition to your jazz/funk collection. I wouldn't say it's worth the import price- I found it elsewhere for half the price, but it's worth a search. It's Groove Merchant- Ya Dig?"
3,Misleading description,"Amazon's product description is misleading. While this may be a great filter for B&W film photography, I would not recommend it for color pictures or for digital photography. Effects on B&W digital pictures are not as dramatic as the manufacturer claims. No mention is made that the filter may not produce the same effects on digital pics, so perhaps it doesn't work as well as claimed for film, either. And it does not produce good results with color pictures at all, unless your intent is for the colors in your picture to show up as many different shades of green. Might be a good product, but be careful what you intend to use it for."
4,Hear the Blues Exploded Like Never Before,"take these rocking boots through the swamps of the bayou, across dusty miles of American hiway, and scrap them on a New York City sidewalk. somewhere in the stratosphere, there truly is an explosion of blues, hip hop, punk rock, and don't give a fig about anybody but yrself noise. Jon Spencer has always been a master of self-promotion, and with the Blues Explosion, he has a a reason. While not one of their best albums, certainly is a rocker deserving listen. If you have second hand speakers throughout yr house, this is a fantastic party album for you. take a whiff of my pantleg baby!"
1,DO NOT BUY THIS!!!,"I bought the Playcity kit to attach it to my Hartz cage. The connectors are horrible! My hamster managed to escape 6 times because the pieces just fell off. This accessory pack did nothing but cause me serious concern for my hamster because she would be missing for 3 days at a time and not to mention, we have a cat who would love to have her for dinner.I called the company to complain about their product and they told me I must have gotten a faulty kit and offered to send me a replacement for free. I highly doubt that it was ""faulty"". It's cheaply made and a waste of money.Save yourself some trouble and some money by going with Habitrail brand cages. They're connecters are lockable and it's not going to fall apart. I wish I would have bought it in the first place."
1,not sturdy,hello i was glad that this product was out there but when i put it on my cage within a day it broke and my hampster got out and got hurt so not very good quality. thank you very much val.
3,Not for all cabinets,I wish I had checked the dimensions of the clamp before purchasing. It dosen't quite reach in behind the stile on the cabinets I install. Anyone looking for a set at a good price?
4,Pony Nice Tool,Work great when hanging cabinets by my lonesome. A little more time consuming than Wood or Quick clamps. I find that sometimes depending on quality of cabinets that regular clamps work better. With that being said I grab the Ponys first when installing. 8 out of 10 times they do the job better.
5,Amazing,This is one of the best CD's I have bought in a long time. The lyrics are deep and it all comes together in great music. The songs calm me and wake me up to life.
1,The Overrated Virtue of Integrity,"Integrity...Ani...Didn't these words used to go together? Or am I confused? Isn't Ani the blockbuster artist who did Not a Pretty Girl and Dilate? The one who attacks the world with some of the sharpest barbs ever? Then what the heck is this? Aside from a collection of shallow, self-obsessed songs lacking in lyrical content, I mean.Give me Living In Clip any day."
4,Good Disc,Ani Difranco is a Real Artist.She is about the Music unlike the Industry at Large.She Plays Different styles on this Disc.She puts Emotion&Heart into Her Work.She Won't Allow Herself too Be Labeled&That's So Important in this Day&Age of Watered Down Talent&Music in General.Her Work is Worth Checking out.Pulse was the Cut it Lasts a long Time but She has alot of things going on with it.Her Songs Reflect Many Different THemes.A True Independent Maverick.
5,One of the Best Albums Ever,"This album is definitely one of the best albums by Ani and also just one of the best albums. All of the songs are great. Ani has this wondrous gift of expressing all sorts of emotions, feelings, attitudes, etc. in her songs not only through her lyrics but also through the sound of her voice. One of my favorite quotations comes from the song Swan Dive on this album and it goes ~they can call me crazy if I fail all the chance that I need is one in a million and they can call me brilliant if I succeed~"
3,better than the show,"the same thing kept happening on this show: hook ups, sex , and drinking. pretty predictable after a while. the book gave us backround info on brynn that the show never bothered to show cause they wanted to focus on the couples."
4,A good buy,I bought this for my husband and had never watched it before. Its a good movie with a good plot. It keeps you intrested and has some parts that make you do a double take. Its not really scary but its susupenseful but it is not for young children. At least ones that are used to horror films. There were parts that it lagged in but it was quickly picked up again. Plus it ends the way you want it too.
3,Good but not great,"MGM is not known for their great DVD releases but they did a good job with this one. I was not a big fan of the movie when it came out in the theatre. I thought I would give the directors cut a try. The movie is a bit cheesy and I didn't buy Scott as a grizzled detective. The uncut version adds to the story and character development but it's a tad long and I lost interest towards the end of the film. Picture quality is uneven switching between grainy and crystal clear through the whole movie. Sound is awesome though and the disc has some good extras. If you liked the original movie buy it, if you didn't then this version won't change your mind."
4,THE ONE AND ONLY,"This really is a fine tool.Not to mention it is the one and only spring clamp of it's type.If you do any kind of edge clamping at all you know how frustrating it can be to set a clamp quickly and securely.This tool puts an end to all that time stealing adjusting and re-adjusting.Sometimes things can move so slow in tool development but,this little guy is a quantum leap.Tension adjustment,pivoting jaws,unbreakable material and it does exactly as it says CLAMPS EDGING.Four stars on this one.On the down side, it lacks any type of ridges or seration on the hand grips, which makes them a tad slippery and as you know woodworkers have some of the driest hands on the planet.In my opinion this is the finest tool of it's type, and is more than worthy of being in your shop too. Now get out there and clamp an edge."
1,Had to send it back,What is one supposed to do with this tiny little crate? I hoped that I could use to store my apples but this is designed for a doll house.
4,Teens Flip for Flip!,"We ordered several DVD's from Amazon for the Christmas holiday season. My husband and I remember enjoying the Flip Wilson TV show when it first aired. Our sons (ages 15 and 17) got a big kick out of this DVD. It included Flip's trademark character, ""Geraldine"" and her many references to the never-to-be-seen boyfriend, ""Killer"" and Flip's rendition of an enthusiastic preacher from ""The Church of What's Happening Now!"" Ed Sullivan is funny being himself and in a skit with Lucille Ball and ""Geraldine"". Bill Cosby and Flip have a couple of bits that look largely adlib and enjoyable. It is dated, naturally, and the pace is slower than today, but it's worth the price and an enjoyable viewing experience for those of us who remember it and for those younger people we introduce it to."
3,Hilarious classic... edited,"The other review explains how Flip acquired the rights to his show in the early90's and edited the episodes for rerun play. However, I think it was a mistake to use these edited versions for DVD. The editing isn't always very good, and watching the picture gallery feature makes one long for the scenes that are included there but not in the episodes themselves. Still, it's worth it for what is included!"
1,never delivered.,This item has never been delivered. Emailed concerning the metal sign non delivery status but was never contacted about it. I am not very pleased.
5,OFF GLASS!!!!!!!!,Hay Peeps! Man Im tellin you that you have to go get this cd! It is so TIGHT! Ya HEARD? This cd is OFF GLASS!
1,poor sound and reception,"I was very disappointed with the performance of the coby radio. The sound was not true stereo, just mono played through the left and right channel,not that it mattered as the reception was horrid unless you didn't move around too much, which sort of defeats the purpose of a Walkman. I would recommend instead the Sony SRF-59 FM/AM Radio Walkman. It's a few dollars more but well worth it-superior to the coby in every way."
1,Inaccessible Text makes for Agonizing Reading,"""A Colorado History"" [9th ed.] by Ubbelohde/Benson/Smith is burdened by a reader-unfriendly text as inaccessible as an anchor sunk in sand at the bottom of an ocean. The book's subject may be interesting; its scope may be admirably comprehensive; its facts and figures may be derived from the most thorough research; but the authors' presentation of the material is pedantic, plodding, unduly fastidious, and dull, dull, dull. The authors' writing style is worse than merely wooden--it's petrified wooden. Try hacking through 490 pages of that stiff &@#*! Not even the sharpest axe is worth wasting on the effort.My heartiest recommendation: put every copy (including yours, if applicable) in a box, tie it with a ribbon, and throw it in the ever-lovin' deep blue sea."
2,Conceptually Trite,"Using computer ""3D imagery"", Mr. Gibson paints different types of music mixes as balls of color in a clouded room. Right-brained indeed. Not much grit or objectivity to develop such neat balls of color. Conceptually trite, it is in details weak. To his credit, the title is an accurate description of the contents. Save your money. Buy a baseball mitt."
2,Overpriced for what it is.,"This is bs, so expensive for what it is. I'm not saying is horrible, but I've tried so many similar products, but they are either cheaper or work better. Hands down Is Clinical serums are so much better. Similar products for 1/3 price are also Eminence serums (organic).This serum doesn't last for a long time due to consistency too, unlike IS Clinical serum which I love."
5,I broke this book in two....,"... because I use it so often. That's right, there are so many fascinating, helpful word origins in this book that due to over-use and laying the book out flat to read it (over breakfast, etc.), it's the first book I actually split in two down the binding. So now I'll need to get another one. I read a few word origins from this book almost daily, it's my favorite word book. These word origins reveal twists, turns and reverses of the human mind, history and culture over the ages. Mr. Ayto doesn't just pick a few of the most interesting words; I like that a wide variety of words -- including mundane -- can be found here. The author is candid (marking with an asterisk) about which pre-literate word origins involve guess work. At the end of entries you'll often find cross-referenced words."
4,"novel, inventive, fresh aspects on some great songs","For those of you familiar with the songs that Ken Andrews and the rest re-record in their own unique voices, these new musical visions will not disappoint. If you liked the originals, then consider them in the light of such bands as Tool and Failure. If you think that sounds interesting, then this album is all for you."
1,Might have bought this,"Well ... WAKE UP DVD MANUFACTURERS! I would have gladly purchased this but after reading reviews that the beginning and final scene were cut, I won't. YOUR LOSS! These DVD releases and re-releases SHOULD contain ALL scenes, director's cuts, deleted scenes, extras, commentaries, etc. This is what makes them worth buying."
3,Charming romantic comedy,"Probably Al Pacino's funniest performance ever, AUTHOR! AUTHOR! is for anyone who loves romantic comedies and solid scriptwriting. Alan King is hilarious also as Pacino's agent. Engaging and charming performances all around, and a winner if you're looking for something off the beaten path to watch with your kids."
1,not recommended,"This book is definitely not a good introduction to Falun Gong. On the back cover, this book claims to be the first objective scholarly account of the practice. I was shocked however, reading chapter 3 of the book, it showed absolutely no substance or clarity. For a book billing itself as a ""scholarly"" account, the authors were sarcastic, cynical and terribly disrespectful of a belief system that spread faster than any in history - 100 million practitioner worldwide within 6 years of being spread.There are much better ""3rd party"" accounts of Falun Gong - a documentary, ""Beyond the Red Wall"", being one of them.However, if you really want to understand the teachings of Falun Gong you have to read them yourself, just read the the books written by Mr. Li Hongzhi, Falun Gong and then Zhuan Falun."
5,A Good Templar/Freemason book,"I waited until I found a fairly cheap copy of ""Unholy Worship?"", which I just bought from Amazon. I read this book a long time ago, and can highly recommend it to you. Even if short, it is clear, concise and to the point, besides having a good bibliography. DaFoe's other books are great too, and you should try getting them too, and they aren't hard to find now, since two just recently were reprinted. These are the kinds of books that feel just right to curl up with on either a short flight, or on the beach at Cape Cod during the summer. Or on one of those cold winter nights, when you're looking for something to read in front of the fireplace."
5,Easy replacement to exisiting hardwired detectors,"After a recent inspection, several detectors in my hardwired system had reached the end of their useful life and needed to be replaced. Dead giveaway was plenty of false alarms and beeps even after batteries were changed and the detectors were hooked back up to house power. I ordered these replacements (same brand and model) and installation was a cinch, using the exisiting wall mount and wire harness. Fast shipping and good packing."
2,dissapointed,"I found this clamp very difficult to work with, regarding setting up the corner supports and tightening the unit. I called the company and they didn't supply much support. I was using the clamp for picture frames and as I stated, it didn't perform to my satisfactions"
2,BE Cautious before buying!,"I have owned several underwater cameras, and the cons outweigh the pros.PROS: Small & light; conversation starter; always accessable; decent pixCONS: Doesn't always work - no reason why it works sometimes and not other times (works fine if you take it out of the case); does not turn on sometimes; Batteries die fast in the cold;OVERALL, more frustrations with it than happiness, hence the low rating."
4,Yay Area Game,"Look, dont buy this album for lyrics. Buy it for its supream slappage level. Ant Banks and the guests make this album tight. Rappin 4-Tay is a great MC and Captin Save-em is funny but occasionaly annoying. Luckaly there are many guest appearences that keep the flows strong like: E-40, B-Legit, Keak Da Sneak, Agerman, Spice One & Too $hort.""Players Holiday"" is a classic by any standerds. ""The Game"" is an old school gangsta style hit. If your into the bay sound this is a great album. ""Cross Me Up"", ""Pervin"", ""Drinks On Me"", ""On The Reala"" and ""Can't Change"" are all good songs, but if you dont like bay flava you wont feel these as much, this is why people hate on this album, they dont get it.If you like that orginal blay area sund, you'll love the album."
1,Is it worth getting?,"I just wanted to know if this is worth getting, b/c I really like the playz holiday song. maybe I should just buy the single. later. peace"
5,"big badass, he from the dangerous crew","blazin' ant banks. buy it everybody. there are at least 8 real solid tracks that you could listen to every day. pervin is the best. too short on that joint, yo...check it out....""I'm gettin high like jimi hendrix, smokin that northern california tremendous"" the bomb. oh yeah, and if you want classic ant banks - even better than this excellent album ---buy sittin on somethin phat or the big badass. and buy the too short jawnks. word up"
1,Not for short trips,"When I was in sales, I drove around town all day and wanted something to keep ""healthy"" snacks cold in my car. I should have just gotten one of those playmate-style coolers and used freezer packs. The concept of this is great: the little refrigerator KEEPS things cold (or warm) that are already cold (or warm). It runs off the car battery, and holds 6 cans. The problem of course is - in my car anyway - it does not stay on when the car is off. It is slow to cool, so if you make a lot of quick trips it never really has time to get to a good temperature and hold it until you get back in the car and do the same thing repeatedly all day. So, for me, it didn't work out. Perhaps on an extended trip it would come in handy...but it only holds 6 cans, odd sizes or 20 ounce screw-top bottles won't fit."
4,essential ani,"the acoustics on this album kick...no sellout here ladies and gents! she's the real deal, playing her heart out into music that reeks with humanity."
5,Best value for the price,Good sockets with a nice finish and easy to read numbers. I have not seen a socket fail yet and I hope they last for many more years.
5,Great investment,"It only seems expensive, what's not to love. Ingersoll Rand, a name you can trust and will stand behind there product. Bigger and heavier than I expected, but a great solid set."
3,"super-goofy, but music can't hold up","OK, the first track is from Maximum Carnage video game, but nothing else is. There are some good songs (ORange Krunch, Carnage Rules, Bear Song...), but for the most part, the music is lame. buy it cheap for the neat comic and goofiness"
2,Would be better if the leg holes were bigger.,"I ordered this for our 2nd vehicle and it served its purpose well, except for the fact that the leg holes are are too small. I ordered it because of the low price, but paying a little more for bigger leg holes may be best. It was always a struggle/hassle to get my son's feet/shoes through them or out of them. After only 2 weeks of having it, we were ready to buy a replacement like the Bright Starts Comfort & Harmony Cozy Cart Cover, Calypso Blue cover we already had. It usually took 2 of us to get his feet in/out. He's 22 months, so maybe this works better for younger kiddos. Needless to say, we lost it while on vacation (it must have fallen out of the trunk while pulling out the stroller), so I'm ordering a different brand today."
3,Not Bad but Not Great,"Overall, good for the price. Have seen others that seem better. Doesn't really fit the Costco carts, especially now that their carts come with a self scanner holder."
4,Does the job,"We have used this a few times now and it does seem to fit well on most carts, on some it feels like it is too big. My lil boy (9 months) seems to be enjoying the rides on carts and looks comfy doing so. I don't like the colors that much but over all I am satisified."
3,Great,"I like my new cover...it's practical and works for both cart and highchair. The only thing that would be better is a self containing bag. It does use a strap to hold it all together, but when trying to carry baby and cover to cart it gets to be a handful. Am delighted to keep extra germs away from baby sucking on cart, etc...and nice colors too. Has a great toy attachment area and pockets inside for burp rag or more toys. You also don't have to handle the cart yourself keeping you hands cleaner for handling baby."
1,garbage,"This guy Cohen is a fraud and his books an endless and relentless stream of unmitigated glibness. He inhabits the realm of the merely plausible and is a dark angel of the imaginary. Beware of soft shoe shufflers dancing round inside your head who take you on the road to nowhere and then abandon you. It's a callous and cruel trip exclusively tailored for weak minded suckers. Following a guru destroys the followers and the teacher....submission to the will of another is a total abdication of responsibility and a shameful act. Cohen encourages and indeed coerces his disciples to do this and he is thus guilty of a heinous spiritual crime against humanity....he is a man immersed in the corruption of his own egomania, a prisoner of darkness. Read this book at your peril."
4,heart rate watch summary,"The heart rate watch has been reliable, at a reasonable cost. Only issue is that the chest monitor is less than convenient to put on, and remove after exercising."
3,Heart Monitor Watch,It works fine but if you have a coat on it turns off all by itself.Bought it for my husband.
5,Timex HRM,This is my first heart rate monitor and I wasn't looking for anything to complex. It does exactly what the product review said it would and the chest strap fits comfortably. I highly recommend this product.
1,"I'd love to tell you how this item works, but...","It was sent to me with a dying battery. The digital screen on the watch would fade in and out, the indigo didn't work, every button had to be pressed a hundred times to register that anything had happened on the watch face. Also, the chest strap didn't work. It gave me three readings - a resting rate of 200+, a resting rate of 61, and a resting rate of 90. It took me about 20 tries to get even these inaccurate readings. It was suggested that I change the batteries in both of the NEW products I just recieved two days ago and only removed from packaging last night. So, for the $34.99 that the watch cost, plus around $15 to change the watch battery, plus $2.50 for a new chest strap battery... That's over $50.00. If I wanted to spend over 50, I would've bought a monitor with more features! And even if I buy the batteries and get everything changed, I'll be out even more money if it still doesn't work and I have to send it back. Not cool."
5,Inexpensive and easy to use,"Great tool to help me reach my target heart rate and maximize my cardio workouts. I recently started back on a workout routine and needed an inexpensive and easy to use heart rate monitor watch that would allow me to monitor my heart rate, handsfree, during my cardio work out at the gym. This watch has the basic funtionality that I need plus work out equipment at the gym picks up the signal and displays on the screen so I don't have to keep looking at my wrist."
4,simple and effective,"If you just want your heart rate monitored, this item is easy and it works. I keep it in my gym bag and slap it on prior to spin class. Makes it easy at a glance for me to keep in my heart rate zone. That's all I wanted or needed - no need for more expensive gadget for just that purpose."
4,Well worth the price!,Does a good job of reading the heart rate. The strap has to be snug fitting for it to work. Overall quite satisfied with the product.
2,ugh... i didn't know it BEEPED!,"The chest strap beeps on every heartbeat. True, it's not very loud and you can't hear it when you got your headphones in or when you're running outside, but you can't turn it OFF! So if you are at the gym, you are now ""that beeping guy."" This thing is embarrassing. I haven't decided if it's worth trying to return, but the description should at least mention it."
1,Very difficult directions!,This product comes with 2 instruction booklets! This should give you a clue about how hard it is to use. I gave this to my daughter as a gift and came very close to returning it Christmas morning. She finally got it working after she soaked the sending device in water while it was strapped across her chest. This seems like a lot of trouble to me but she decided to try it a bit longer before sending it back.
5,"Good, Cheap Heart Rate Monitor","This product is great for the health enthusiast who doesn't want to spend more than $30 or $40 to know what their heart rate is. It's a basic product, easy to use, and helpful for keeping your heart fit."
3,It work's ok for 6 months,"This HRM watch worked fine for about 5 months. I used dailly for 4 hours, the watch started to fail and I needed to change the battery of the chest band in the first 2 months. I did the same procedure 3 months later, and that's it. It never worked again. Now I'm looking for a better HRM watch."
1,Wrist Band Causes Severe Rash,"The Timex Heartrate Monitor does a good job. It is accurate and easy to use. However, the wrist band has something on it either a mold release or compound that caused my wrist to break out in a rather severe rash. The rash is bright red and has very itchy hive like skin break out that results in a pimple like rash. I have tried to clean the band with alcohol and this has not solved the problem. I now have to wrap my wrist in a bandage prior to using the monitor."
2,Show me how to open the chest strap,I have another monitor which has an easy-to-open chest strap. I am afraid to try harder to open Timex's. So far I haven't succeeded and Timex ignores the problem in its instrctions (unless I missed it)
1,Extremely uncomfortable chest heart monitor,"This product is built for people who have elastic arms. It is almost impossible to get the chest encircling heart monitor on. Then you have to moisten it to get skin contact which is a source of discomfort. Finally, it is like trying to pull a neoprene scuba suit off over your head. What a stupid design. Also, it is extremely uncomfortable on and it chafed my skin. The watch monitor is bulky and difficult to set. It is also very difficult to figure out how to return the product. No shipping manifest was in the box. When I printed out my purchase the date didn't print either so it was very hard to figure out where to look for the returns information."
1,HRM was DOA,"The clock part worked but the HRM would not show any connection with the sensor. After owning many Timex watches for well over twenty five years this one looked cheap and of very poor quality. The display is supposed to display a heart when you use the HRM, on the watch/hrm I received only the lower part of the heart was visible.To return the watch Amazon wanted me to take to the post office and pay the return postage, to be refunded. A waste of time."
1,Chest strap makes audible beeping noise that can't be turned off,Chest strap makes audible beeping noise that can't be turned off. Very disappointed since the rest of the product seems very good for the price.
5,good,Basic model that does what it says it will do - it monitors your heart rate. No problems picking up my heart rate even through a little chest hair. Only takes seconds to start monitoring once the start button is pressed.
2,Returned after one week,"I was extremely disappointed in this product. It did not work until I was completely warmed up (about 10 minutes into my workout) even though I wet the belt as recommended. Thus I could not achieve an accurate reading on my total workout. The minute I stepped outside the watch stopped recording my heart rate altogether, even though I could clearly hear the waist belt beeping to the rhythm of my heart! This alone rendered the monitor pretty useless as I am predominantly an outdoor runner.I would not recommend purchasing this product, even though it is on the cheaper side. Save up to buy a more expensive model. It will be worth it! Not to mention I returned this product a few weeks ago and have still not received a refund. So not worth the hassle."
1,zero stars Timex T5G941,"Mine was delivered yesterday. Out of the box today. Set the time and date on the watch. Wet the pads. Wet the pads. Wet the pads. Wet me and the pads. Wet me and the pads again and again. Pressing the On/Off button brings up the display ""HOLD FOR INFO."" Then it shows 4.05 activity, then 71 avg bpm, then 121 peak bpm, but the ""- - -"" symbol never displays. The heart symbol never displays. It never pairs with the strap sensor.I removed the strap's battery and checked it on my DC voltmeter. It has a full charge. Replaced it into the strap. Tried all again and again and again.Not enough time left today to send it back to Amazon. UPS closed already. It'll go back on Wednesday."
2,If you enjoy your oldies in mono!,"I honestly cannot recommend this cd for the following reasons- all selections with exception of I'll Hold Out My Hand are in flat and what sounds like totally unprocessed mono. Many of the songs have a lot of hiss also.I have the cd copy of the Clique lp and it sounds really good in full digital stereo. Ihonestly bought this because I was looking for a clean cd copy of Friends by Feather. The copy here sounds like they pressed it too ""loud"". It really doesn't sound much better than my original promo 45 copy!. The bottom line is why not remix what they could in true stereo and at least do some reprocessing to enhance the selections that were in mono. I think they just threw it together and really didn't care about the sound quality. What a shame with some real obscure gems here too. Better luck next time White Whale Records. Thanks for the memories!"
4,Tell me where you're going to.,"White Whale was a Los Angeles based independent record label that operated between 1965 and 1971. The Turtles were their most successful act, but they had a few other acts that managed to place singles in the Hot 100. Most of the tracks here are good songs that should have been hits, even if they weren't. I especially like ""Follow Me"" by Lyme & Cybelle and ""All Strung Out"" by Nino Tempo & April Stevens, as well as the songs by the Turtles, of course. A lot of these songs are downright obscure, and it's a real treat for pop music fans to have them on CD. The tracks are all in the original mono single mixes, with the exception of ""I'll Hold Out My Hand"" by the Clique, which is in stereo for some reason that I'm not aware of."
5,One of her best,"I LOVE THIS CD!My first introduction to Ani, and remains one of favourite cd's today!She definetly 'hit it' on this one! Her production is tight and songwriting is just suburb and the varied acoustic, electronic, rock, folk blends really nicely here!Love all the tortured melodramatic songs (Ani said this on Living in Clip)Such an Ani classic!!!"
5,"Soul, funk, and amazing are words that describe Ani DiFranco","Ani DiFranco is a woman with a while lot of soul and a dash of funk. She gives power to women to fight for what they believe in. Her words, I know, are so meaningful to all her fans. Her beats shall live on! ANI is certainly an AMAZING and INSPIRATIONAL woman."
4,MSI-Pro-12130 Verticle Toggle Clamps,"The clamps are very well made and completely adjustable. I used these in a table saw jig and I had no problems. Having a few of these around the shop will be a plus to any woodworker. They work great for jigs, bench top clamps and any other ideas you come up with. They are well made and should last for a long while. I should order some more."
2,COOL!!!,"Este CD [Single] contiene 3 buenos remixes del pegajoso tema de Elvis Crespo, ""Pintame"". Este disco es bien bailable pero solo lo podras escuchar una vez, ya que el ""Pintame..."" dura un total de casi 8 minutos y luego de un rato ya no lo vas a querer volver a escuchar. Debieron haber puesto dos o tres temas mas a este single. Mejor recomiendo los dos excelentes discos de Elvis Crespo: ""Suevemente"" y ""Pintame"". Los dos CD estan super buenos y bailables. Tambien recomiendo ""Pasional"" de Jessica Cristina, ""Amigas Mias"" de Sonsoleil, ""Caminando"" de Tonny Tun Tun, ""Alto Honor"" de Grupo Mania, ""Maria Alejandra"" de Maria Alejandra y ""Aqui Estoy"" de Michael Gabriel."
2,Cheap construction,piezo ignitior snapped off after second use. mirco regulator is weak and doesn't control flame very well. purchased with brunton stove stand-off [...] which also broke after about 6th use; hose snapped off at base.
2,"Great design, short life...","I purchased this stove for a backpacking trip in the high Sierras. I worked beautifully the first time I used, it, but after 3 short days and limited use, the piezo lighter no longer worked. It's a very small, very nice design, heats water up very fast, but in my experience, not reliable. Amazon made it extremely easy to return it, and credited my account in a short time."
3,"Inconsistent, but they can work","At this point, we've all been told that most of the piping-related goods coming out of Pakistan are of poor quality. Ok, this is usually true. However, in my experience, I've have used these reeds quite often from the early days of starting out to the days of playing in Grade one. More money will often buy you better reeds, but honestly, I've played reeds like these in every type of chanter, and they generally work acceptably well. In one of my best chanters, I've had a Pakistani reed in there for at least eight years and never had trouble with it. A reed being of a known brand name DOES NOT mean that it's better than everything else. Many Pakistani practice chanter reeds can be quite good. It's just better to have a few to choose from, and what's wrong with having an extra reed or two anyway?"
5,Best air filter on the market,"I have used K&N filters in my 2003 Ford F-250 diesel (7.3L) for years. Better airflow, some increase in fuel mileage and they last a long time. At Amazon's price, I don't clean them, I just replace them about every 30,000 miles."
4,Interesting book about our future,"For me this book was a real page turner. It held my interest and I finished this book within a few hours. Sylvia's predictions in this book can be very plausible and others are way out there. A few of her predictions will be happening within the next few years so we can see how right or wrong she is. I believe Miss Browne is a true prophet, and like she said in her book no one is 100% accurate. I recommend this book if you are interested in this type of subject, even if you are very skeptical it raises some questions about our future and where we are headed. Definitely something to think about."
5,I'ts oh cool for those fans and all the worl...,"Es un disco muy sensual, Muy puro, muy fino, muy delicadO, muy sensible, cada canción es un mundo al cual Thalia nos transporta, es una excelente y magica producción discografica, es muy recomendable, a todos uds. les digo que les va a encantar el sexto sentido de nuestra Latin Star Thalia!, ¿Y UDS YA ESUCHARON EL SEXTO SENTIDO?, ¡¡¡NO SE QUEDEN CON LAS GANAS Y VAMOS!!!....."
2,Porfavor vuelve a la musica que antes hacia,"No es el mejor de Thalia, las canciones no pegan, es un disco que no tiene calidad. ESPERO que Thalia aprenda que es CALIDAD lo que cuenta y no CANTIDAD....porfavor tomate tu tiempo y haz un album bueno."
2,same and same .. It's a shame,"what's wrong with thalia? I'm really a a fan I have almost all her cd,but this. O my God!!!! is the same like the others,estefano left all the best songs to Paulina Rubio definitly.the song that really are good are the ballads""no puedo vivir sin ti"" and ""un alma sentenciada"".I would like a cd with boleros or something similar in Thalia's voice.this cd is only to truely fans.."
3,podria ser mejor,"El disco no es malo, pero suena igual a sus anteriores producciones, es verdad que thalia no es la mejor cantante que existe, pero tambien es verdad que tiene lo suyo, una belleza increible, carisma, y una bonita voz, pero creo que lo que deberia hacer es cambiar de productores ya que Estefano o Emilio Estefan, hacen que todos los artistas con los que trabajan suenen igual, de cualquier manera el sexto sentido, no esta tan mal, la mejor cancion del album es Olvidame y el foto interior es super padre."
3,Thalia's Done Better,"This is not a bad album, but i only like half the songs (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 11) (not counting the english versions..which i didn't like)..i like thalia but i've heard better stuff from her.."
3,Not her best yet,"First than anything, I gotta say I am a Thalia fan since her album debut ""Arrasando"". Now, this new album, ""El Sexto Sentido"" is a very good comeback after her crappy English album release. However, for some reason, this new album, im my opinion, doesnt reflect her best. I consider her albums Arrasando & Thalia (spanish one) way better than this new release. Amar sin ser amada, Loca & Alma Sentenciada are my favorite songs on this cd. The rest of the songs, at leats for now, after having listened to it at least 50 times, doesnt make it for me. They all sound boring and some of them even silly. The music and her vocals are very good thou. If you dont have any Thalia album yet Id recommend you her cd Thalia (spanish) over this one. I think she could do way better than this. Time will tell us."
2,More of the same,"Thalia is one of those artists that never evolve with time. Her music lacks spirit and originality. She tries too hard to appeal to everyone with her fake public persona and generic pop music, but gets nowhere. If you want to listen to good latin pop female artists, try Shakira's latest ""Fijacion oral vol. 1"" (one of the best albums ever), Paulina Rubio's full of energy disc ""Pau-Latina"", Gloria Trevi's ""Como Nace El Universo"" or Julieta Venegas' ""Si""."
4,Intro To Lector,From the imagination of the author of 'Black Sunday' comes the introduction to the most talked about monster invented.That monster 'Hanibal Lector'.Hanibal the canibal is introduced here by Thomas Harris in the first installment of three.Red Dragon! Inside reaveals some tortured police infomation and the criminal secret of Hanibal lector who reeks havok on the world. Be warned for some pretty strong swearing. The book is'nt too long and will shock you to the bone as you explore the sick twisted mind of red dragon
2,Cliched. Extremely overrated,"Well, at least it reads fast. This extrememly underwhelming serial killer yarn has some interesting plot elements, but far too many have been done before and done better. The serial killer was surprisingly tame, and Harris's attempts to bring the reader into his mind were hackneyed tropes of the genre.An earlier and superior example of this genre is Jim Thompson's ""The Killer Inside Me."""
2,vastly overrated,"I must admit I just don't understand why so many people think this is a superior crime novel -- the central character of Francis seems incredibly hard to believe -- a meek little guy with Superman's body and the whole business with the fake teeth?? I couldn't get scared of him because I never could believe such a figure existed. He's nothing like real serial killers, who are so much more typical of people around us: that's scary. He's such an anomaly that the chances of running into him are minimal: so why should I be scared? I find the writing in this book to be embarrisingly overwrought as well. When I've shown fans some of the worst passages, they say, ""well, I skip over most of that stuff."" So their idea of a great book is one you skip writing in?? This book does offer thrills, no question, but it doesn't show the talent of dozens of over crime writers out there."
3,"Easy to read physically, but to tough to read emotionally","I bought this in the airport yesterday. I just finished it now. So, clearly, this book is highly readable. The plot---which is the best thing going for it---is riveting and well planned. Although some of it may be predictable, most of it is surprising and fresh (despite the fact its the ""oldest"" in the Hannibal series). The most disturbing aspect of the book is the characterization of the killer---its far from a generic character study---this guy makes most bad guys look like baby bunnies, and Harris (who I would never let babysit my kids) does a disturbingly good job of inventing him. After I finished, I thought: ""Gee, that was a good read, but what good did it do me?"" It definitely didn't make me a better person. But, if anything, it made me more aware of the evil in the world, and convinved me to double check every lock on every door before I went to bed."
4,GOOD READ! HARD TO PUT DOWN!,"Just finished reading the book and thought it was great! Although it was very gruesome, the characters were well developed esp. Graham and Dolarhyde, two very interesting characters. The Red Dragon is so close to the Buffalo Bill character in ""Silence of the Lambs"". I was impressed. I chose to read this to get background to the whole trilogy and to be prepared for ""Hannibal"". Hopefully I won't be disappointed!"
3,A bit disappointing...,"I bought this book after reading all the rave reviews it received, and because I enjoyed ""The Silence of the Lambs"" which I read before the movie was produced - thank goodness, the movie did not do the book justice. ""Red Dragon"" was a disappointment. It wasn't very suspenseful, and a lot of the situations created by Harris were silly, especially the letters written to Lector and sent by him. Prisons monitor prisoner's in-going and out-going mail as a matter of procedure, the mass confusion about Lector's reply to The Pilgrim was totally off-putting, it just didn't make any sense. In short, this is a decent book, not a good one."
3,A bit twisted,"I just finished reading ""Red Dragon,"" and I have to admit that Harris does manage to keep the reader intrigued. However, the writing style he uses is a little difficult to follow. The sentances are choppy at times, making the reader have to back up a lot to get the gist of the meaning. I like the fact that Harris is able to perfectly paint a scene in words. He is a very good descriptive writer with a flair for the macabre. He needs work in writing from a woman's POV, so next I will be reading ""Silence of the Lambs"" to see if he has gotten any better. Very thrilling, somewhat disturbing, a little weak in areas (the end could have been better), quite morbid, but overall, I give it 3 1/2 stars. (Why no half stars, guys?)"
4,"So, who's developing YOUR film...","Have decided to read all the books by Harris depicting Hannibal Lechter. Starting in chronological order I found this book to be better than the movie version of ""Silence."" and infinitely better than the movie version of the book, ""Manhunter."" The ending in the book is much more creative than the movie.I thought it was creative to have the psychopath be a film developer. It got me thinking about how much strangers have access to your personal affairs. Who knows who's developing your pictures? Anyone could figure out where you live, and know some personal things about you.It's the mark of a good psycho thriller if it creeps into your conscious in everyday life! Makes you want to beware of having getting pictures developed, having food delivered, getting your taxes done... anything that would give some psychopath access to your life..."
3,Don't read this one with the lights off,I feel so sorry for Will Graham. He's caught between duty and family. Jack Crawford should have known better than to exploit Will's character flaw of fear against him. I have to sympathize with Molly on her dislike of him
4,"Good book, a little rough around the edges.","This is the 2nd book I've read by Harris, the first being ""Black Sunday"". I have to say this is quite an improvement. There isn't a whole lot in here about Hannibal Lecter, so I was a bit disappointed. I expected more development about him as part of the story. The story itself is quite good and keeps the pages turning at the end. However I'm not a big fan of Harris' dry writing style (the only character you really get to feel for is the Red Dragon himself) and so I didn't give it 5 stars. I will read his other works soon, however."
2,Nowhere near what I expected!!,"I seem to be of only a few who seem to greatly dislike this book, but it was BORING!! I've read so many great books by the most well known horror/suspense authors, and I wanted to read someone different for a change....I was very stupid!! The beginning of Red Dragon was very entertaining and held my interest for about the first 60 pages, then the plot and over all terror declined rapidly!! I was expecting Hannibal Lector to play a larger part in this book, but he was only spoken of a few times. The long drawn out parts of ""Grandmother"" should have been left out, they didn't have anything to do with the main story!! If Mr. Harris would have stuck more to the crime scenes and to finding the killer instead of going through the killer's BORING life the book would have been very, very good!! The ending was so-so, it wasn't predictable, and it was pretty suspenseful! But, if you're looking for a good horror/suspense book read Stephen King or Dean Koontz!!"
3,Let down by so many typos and a predictable ending,This starts out so well. The characters are interesting and the plotline intriguing. What goes wrong though is the introduction of Dolarhyde to the reader. I don't think it worked at all. As he was developed he lost his menace and the ludicrous ending is like something from a B-grade movie. The use of abuse as a reason too for Dolarhyde's activities was cliched and predictable. I don't know if it was just my copy but there were so many typos in it by about the thirtieth chapter i'd lost count. It is the latest edition too which seems really bizarre. Could have and probably should have been better than it is. Let's hope Silence of the Lambs proves to be a little bit better.
5,"After reading this book, I had to sleep with the light on.","I've read lots of suspenseful books, but this author knows how to string you along. He kept my heart pumping and kept me guessing throughout the book. This book touched me personally and disturbed me so much that I had to sleep with the light on. Boy, was that fun!"
4,Compact and light,"This butane powered lantern is very small and compact compared to other models, it doesnt weight much and you dont have to worry about breaking any glass. The only problem is that it provides about 60% of a mantle lantern light and is a bit more yellow. Also the light is more concentrated in a 180 degree radius because of the mirrors. However if you plan to camp for more than a couple of days, this is the best deal."
2,Not for a Diverse Group,"I bought this set for our church library but had to discard the first book, which features two Korean boys, supposedly sent by ""mistake"" to an adoptive Christian family. The tone didn't seem right to me. A Korean friend read it, at my request, and was upset. ""Not realistic,"" she said, in these ways: Boys would never be sent by ""mistake,"" not only because careful records are kept but also because boys are more prized in Korea. The twin boys supposedly rejected the pink room that was prepared for them. ""Korean boys like pink,"" she said. And little Korean boys would not be as destructive and violent as they are portrayed to be.If an author needs to set up a conflict -- be careful when you use ethnicity. We certainly could not have this in the library of our diverse church.The Koreans play a minor role in the rest of the series and their portrayal is not objectionable. I compare this series to a Christian Hardy Boys."
1,NOISY - VERY Noisy,"I placed this switch in an isolated central wiring closet that has other network equipment, some with fans and disk drives. There has never been any sound audible outside the wiring closet.This switch sounds like a vacuum cleaner, and is clearly audible and objectionable in every room that abuts the closet.The switch seems to function OK but the noise is so loud that I regret the purchase.Unless you can mount this switch were noise is already very loud, or where noise will not bother anyone, I'd recommend you look elsewhere."
1,Doesn't work with Firefox -- or ANY mac browser!,"The fan is surprisingly loud, even for a rack-mounted device intended for a machine room.However, the deal breaker for me (I'm returning the unit I bought) is that the web management interface does not work with Firefox. In fact, it works ONLY with IE on a PC.Given that many other Linksys products work with Firefox, I was pretty surprised.Linksys needs to have a talk with the clue fairy and cut some new firmware."
2,Too small,"Seems nice, but Amazon recommended this with a 185' spool of butchers twine. It was too small for the recommended spool."
3,Too hard to read,A well-written story but too awful a subject. Why do children have to die in the terrible way imagined here? And why do those who live have to carry the burdensinflicted upon them? Maybe reading it now is just bad timing...
3,Competent early novel,"The world seems to have developed an appetite for Katia Lief's crime novels. Perhaps in an attempt to feed that appetite, her publishers have reissued one of her earlier novels, originally published in 2004 and attributed to Kate Pepper.The book reads as a textbook thriller aimed at adaptation for the (small) screen and has all of the elements that one would expect to find and more or less at the point you'd expect to find them. The prose is pretty much textbook stuff, too, and while it flows nicely off the page, there is nothing much about it, or the story, to tax the brain or to shock or surprise.As something to take to the beach to while away a few hours, the novel delivers well -- it is a fast and, in places, gripping read with little by way of digression or discursiveness. Anyone hoping for more than this is likely to be disappointed, however."
2,There are better books on Soviet history,"One of the things that really frustrated me about this book is the fact that the authors do not use citation. Many questionable passages in the book were of interest to me, but alas I could not research the background or validity of those passages. Furthermore, from time to time, the authors' writings seemed ideological and one-sided; certain sentances burried throughout the text had no apparent purpose but to denigrade USSR. There are better and more objective books than this one - Hosking's Russia and the Russians, for example. Better yet, try to learn history from the original sources as much as possible."
4,What a Reunion!,"Anyone who is a fan of the Carpathians must read this book. To truly get the most out of it--read it last so that you can relate and remember all of the wonderful ""dark series"" books Christine Feehan has written."
2,Hmmm....something was missing...............,"I know. It was the rest of the story. I actually thought this book should have been paperback and not hardcover. Especially, as a big part of the book was recipes. And, as I'm currently dieting, desserts just don't appeal to me.I felt kind of cheated. Unless you're a die-hard Christine Feehan fan, the book is really not worth the $23.95 purchase price. Get it at the library, or just wait until the paperback comes out.Try, Lover Awakened by J.R. Ward. A much better read for a fraction of the price of Christine's overpriced novel."
2,over priced item,"i am airborne ranger infantry soldier, i bought this for my survival kit expecting same military standard as issue item for aviator's survival vest. not what i was expecting, over priced for an item that i could have bought cheaper with better features.MAJOR.ALLEN AIRBORNE RANGER INFANTRY 101st Airborne ( Air Assault )"
5,Excellent product,Works perfectly as advertised. This is a nice size unit and the next bigger one is a monster. This holds my smoker door closed with no difficulty.
4,MSI-PRO 225 D horizontal quick release toggle clamps,"These are great toggle clamps. The only reason I gave them a 4 stars is because one of the toggle clamps I received is a little difficult to toggle. Even lubricants don't make that much difference in how well this one toggle moves back and forth. Other than that, these are good, well-priced toggle clamps."
5,MSI-PRO 225-D 51120 Horizontal Quick-Release Toggle Clamps,I required a toggle clamp with plenty of holding power to use on my shop jigs on the router table and needless to say at a reasonable price. I have used these on numerous home made jigs and am very happy with their performance.
5,Half-Life2,What more can I say other than absolutely awesome!! The graphics are incredible and the story line and adventure is the best out there.My compliments to the folks at Valve for another great piece of software!
2,Didnt work,The game i bought didnt work at all but when i bought a new one it was a fun game. So the game is good but i had to buy it twice casue this one didnt work at all buy it from somewhere else.
5,"No noticeable distortion, fits right","I primarily use this with TriX 400 on my Nikkor 50mm f1.8 and the filter threads fit just right (I've had problems with Tiffen filter threads in the past). So far I haven't seen any distortion.Though it does take getting used to looking through the view finder when it's all red, but that comes with any color filter. Results are, as expected, great."
5,"Prompt Service, Great Price",My husband after seeing this watch expressed an interest in owning one. I shopped locally and on the internet and I found the best price here. Ordering was easy and delivery was prompt. He has still not seen it yet as it is going to be his Christmas present. I have since done more shopping on Amazon and have not been disappointed.
4,Sounds great!,Sub woofer sounds great in second room. very very good price. Connection are good (not the best). Overall I am very happy with the cables.
3,Inexpensive but cheaply made cable.,The plastic used in the outer cover is a somewhat hard type. Making the cable very stiff and difficult to work.
4,Good filter!,"This filter is a good buy. Its well made and performs its task. The only thing I didn't like was the case it came in. Not very protective. There is a 2mm thick piece of foam on one side, and then a thick product book on the other that keeps it from moving. Take out the product book and it can slide around alot. Still a good buy though. Especially for the price."
4,Good Hammond Organ Playing,"I thought this cd showed a man that could play the Hammond well. His style is all his own. For anyone collecting music of Hammond Organ work, I would recommend this cd.Jim"
5,A great read!,"Louise Plummer's A Dance For Three (32511-8) tells of Hannah, who finds herself pregnant and abandoned by the boyfriend she thought she loved. After a breakdown she slowly learns new lessons about caring for herself and others -and accepting the help of a long-absent mother."
1,A dance for one.,"I thought that it was a rather good book, but it needed to be seen through more than Hannah's eyes. Maybe if we saw it a a different way we would have thought different for Milo, her mom, or anyone else. Ionly gave it one star because I feel that is all that it is worth. Very well written but not enough was going on. The author took it one thing at a time at a medium pace. Not to exciting. I had to read this book for an english class, so you can tell by my review that it was not a book of my choice. But for being a book that was required, I had to read it. I was alright."
4,Helpful book!,I found thiss book to be a great way to help my children focus back on the real meaning of Christmas. It's a great way to teach them about my faith in a fun and creative way. I think you'll love it.
5,Great tool!,"Great tool for large projects requiring precision alignment, strength, and accuracy. Possibly an overkill for most average projects, but essential to providing extra reach and precision required for larger pieces. Don't invest in this as your only clamp, rather purchase only enough to provide you with the capability you need. Augment with varying other appropriate lengths of clamps to suit your needs."
1,Broken first day,"I received the jorgensen 48"" clamp and put it to use the day of receipt. by the end of the day, the screw end had cracked around the acme thread. I used the clamp roughly 2 hours before failure."
5,The Very Best of Tommy Cash,"Truly the ""Very Best of Tommy Cash""! If you like country music, and a good sound this is the one to own."
2,Old ones were better,"I'd love to gush about these clamps, but I can't. Yes in the old days they were pretty good. (some of the jaws are slipping now.) I have 30-40 of them. The newest ones we bought in 2005 were poorly finished. The jaw surfaces were not ground flat leaving a ridge on the clamping surface, and the jaws are not parallel. I came close to sending them back. They will be the last I buy. The Bessey's are a lot better."
2,She's better with more sophisticated material...,"Patti Page made some great records in her time, but this disc, which primarily includes country and folk tunes, doesn't really have any of them. The production sounded dated back when these tracks were originally released in the '60s. By this point, Patti had stopped being an innovator and was simply trying to score a hit. Her vocals are as languid and smooth as ever, but the bland material and sleepy production make this stuff ultimately forgettable."
1,Sprinting Through Nostalgia,"The Forgotten Promise by Ilmars Birznieks is a sprint through nostalgia. Birznieks attempts to quicken the book's pace by jetting characters from the US to Germany to Austria. Yet, the disjuncted underlying theme of the book is the portrayal of pre-World War Latvia, an independent Baltic State several hundred miles to the north of Germany, as a utopia.While the book is rife with blemishes, there are two major flaws: (1.) the characters are flat and uninteresting and (2.) the premise for the book seems artificial. There is no compelling reason to side with the protagonist, Larry Walters, other than one's disdain for the antagonist, Jill Walters. And, there is little connection between the characters and their fondness of Latvia.This book seems more like a string of malformed ideas for short stories than a cohesive novel. This is one you can leave on the shelf."
4,If you have a boat on a trailer... you need this,"Even a lightweight aluminum fishing boat can be difficult to push about by itself, especially over uneven ground. Those tiny swivel-down casters found on most trailers are okay for light boats on smooth pavement, but once you start dealing with boats over 500 lbs or trying to move a trailer over grass, things get difficult. That's where this little hand truck earns its keep. I bought mine to help move my 900lb Peep Hen sailboat around the back yard and get it in position to hitch up to my car, and for that purpose it was invaluable- especially given the low price."
3,"Great price and quality, but too short for some trailers","Ball height is only 16"". Unable to flip folding tongue jack on my boat trailer. You have to lift trailer to flip folding tonque jack. Buyer beware. This is also true on similar models."
1,Poor Packaging !!,"When I received this, the package was torn and the foam was damaged. Sleepshop was prompt in refunding the money, but remember to buy this at your own risk. Sleepshop told me that they have 2 out of 100 mattress with shipping issues.Remember to inspect the package before accepting it from the fedex guy."
2,Disappointing,"My wife and I purchased this mattress in April of 2010. In late 2011 we noticed that each night we would roll into a 'hole'. Unlike some couples on a queen bed, we like to sleep very close together. Now, each night we roll into our 'nest' and contemplate our next mattress purchase."
5,Purchased but not yet recieved,"There was a mixup during my order - Queen Theripudic 12-inch Memory Foam Mattress. Some how a second Mattress was, after I had obtained my order number, and hung up. I discovered on my bank statement about the duplicate order and charge. After a very nice phone call to a gentlemen at Dynasty Mattress and a short call to Amazon. The whole error was righted. I am amazed at the easy to deal with and concern of two such large companies. BRAVO DYNASTY AND AMAZON."
3,"Nice, but not very accurate","A nice watch although it has a few ""features"" that I would rather it didn't have.First of all, it gains at least a minute a day. The peace of mind in not replacing batteries is overshadowed by the fact that I need to correct the time each day.Secondly, it would be a great addition if it had either a backlight or luminous hands. The watch is totally useless at night without turning on a light.I love the look, and I'm sure it is sturdy. However, the two issues make it less than impressive."
1,Girl From Rio,"This was one of the worst movies I've ever seen.The only good thing about it was Vanessa Nunes. (Beautiful woman!)Otherwise, awful acting, awful composition, awful directing and so on.Just plain embarassing.With good direction, it could have had potential.Try ""Woman On Top"" with Penelope Cruz. Not that it was a ""great movie""but it was sensual, loaded with great Bossa Nova music(no Bossa Nova in ""Girl from Rio"") and lots of beautiful Penelope. Kinda strangebut compelling."
3,Fun Fluff,"Suspend all disbelief and have a good time. Once again, Hugh Laurie is handed a role that's somewhat beneath him, but he makes the best of it. He plays the victim so well and isn't half bad as a samba dancer, either, but the film turns so silly at times that it's a little embarrassing to watch. Laurie's comic style is a bit like the young Dick Van Dyke's: very physical. His years in vehicles like ""Blackadder"" and ""Jeeves & Wooster"" have shown, however, that he's capable of much more refined and esoteric comedy, and his role in ""House"" demonstrates his depth as a dramatic actor as well. Although he's perfect for this role, I feel his talents are rather wasted here. The locales and music, however, are superb, and the huge dance & drum number is breathtaking. I'm going to go out to buy some samba CDs now."
2,"""I need a paycheck...""","This is one of those ""I really need a paycheck"" movies. Its awful from start to finish. The first one wasn't ""amazing"" but in comparison to this, it should have gotten an oscar. Luke Mably was the only one from the original to appear in this, and though he's good, he seems bored (I don't blame him). I gave the movie major points for casting Jonathan Firth. He's the only high point in the entire thing. Granted he's not given much to work with, but he tries and I believe he got a chuckle out of me once or twice. Rent it if you really want to see it..."
2,Another movie that doesnt fit the first movie,"It's sad to say that the movie is a waste of talent, Although I was a big fan of Eddie and Paige in the orginal movie Eddie's role was extremely boring and not as charming. Paige I have seen her in better movies, such as pride and prejudice the comedy. The plot of the movie was boring.... very disappointing to all."
1,she's no Julia Stiles,"This movie has to be one of the worst sequels I've ever seen. I am a big fan of The Prince and Me, but as soon as I started watching this one, I knew it could never stand up to the original. Prince Edvard (Luke Mably) is the only returning character, some characters are missing completely, and most of who was cast...has little to no ability in portraying their character. Did they even watch/study the original movie? Terrible acting. Soren (Jonathan Firth) was decent. Paige (Kam Heskin) was ok, but definitely no Julia Stiles. Very disappointed, but glad I only rented it."
3,kinda corny,It was entertaining but a little corny. I understand there is a series of movies ......I guess I will have to watch all of them.
2,Too Cheesy,The first movie in this series is far better than this one. Theres different characters and the story line is way too predictable. Rate two stars if not one...
3,Amici Defined + Australia Tracks,"Original 12 tracks still fantastic, but there were only two so-so tracks from the Australian performances, making this a real rip-off for the price plus shipping. I'd advise buying only the original CD without the 2 australian tracks."
3,"Sizing is way off, product is good though...","I purchased these because I own other under armor products and have been pleased with both their durability and comfort...I purchased the same size as the four other pair of under armor compression shorts that I have and these were so big on me they literally fell off...I don't know if these came with a sizing chart bc I ordered the size I always get but these were certainly different... Otherwise, product was typical under armor quality (good)!"
1,Really bad.,"My daughter is a Thomas fanatic and bought this with her own money at the toy store. It is by far the worst board game I've ever had to play. It is very non-linear, in that you are not going from Point A to Point B. It's also repetitive and infuriating in its lack of sense. My daughter likes it just because it has her beloved Thomas, but we just groan when she brings it out. It really could have been much better. I hate when they will just put a popular character on anything. Would it have cost them more to have this make sense?"
5,Watching Stars Dance,"This is a clear, concise, and comprehensive review of variable stars, and how to observe them. For simple visual observations or detailed CCD photometric evaluation, this is a great book to have."
4,Good for fans of Alice in Chains and Soundgarden,"UPO's debut is fairly good, but it's definitely nothing new. As other reviews have said, it's the same grunge tricks that were done in the early 90's by greats like AIC and Soundgarden. So to make this simple, and to repeat myself for the 3rd time, if you liked AIC and Soundgarden, you'd probably like UPO. Not every song is memorable, but most of the songs on here are very good, like ""Godless"", ""The Hurt"", and ""Feel Alive"". The singer is good, and the songs are well-written; but it's all been done before. So if you like grunge, and wish AIC was still around, pick this up. I give it a 7/10."
4,just get it - it's awesome,"This CD isn't necessarily groundbreaking in any way but it takes a good formula and keeps it alive. For me, having grown up listening to heavy rock from the early 80's and on thru the ""grunge years"" it's refreshing to know that good straightforward rock is NOT dead. I hear influences in this work from everyone from the Cult, Soundgarden, a little bit of Alice and Chains. But it stops there - they're only influences. The band has taken its roots and made a top-quality work that is wearing out my CD player ( and my coworkers). If you love rock, you'll love this. I usually listen to harder, faster music but this one has crept up into the collection - the songs are well written and when it gets going, you want to turn it WAY up on a good stereo system. I'll buy their next one based on this. Hope to hear more from UPO."
3,tight fit,"I purchased this for a 99 Goldwing SE, it doesn't fit snugly. Has to squeeze or trim down the rim."
1,Waste of money,This light is an absolute waste of money. It should be listed as a kids novelty item. Light production is ridiculus and convenience of design is a joke. I would not reccommend this light to anyone.
4,Good book,"I like this book for its concise yet detailed writing. The images help a lot and the explanation of Ayurveda makes it special to me. It does require a lot of practice so those who think its a magic, please do not try pulse reading.This book helps."
4,Great for beginners,"The book does a good job of covering the main aspects of Using Java servlets, JSP, and EJBs, but without in-depth detail.Its well organized and the chapters flow well together. This makes it a nice learning tool, but not necessarily a good reference.If you know Java and want to learn about using servlets, JSP, and EJBs, this is a good book to work with.If you are already programming with servlets, JSP, or EJBs, then I would recommend Marty Hall's books as they are more in-depth and are organized in a ""quick find"" method.Its a great book and I highly recommend it for anyone who wants to begin developing web apps using Java."
5,Great Book,"This the really great book.I didn't know about servlet,jsp and EJB.But now I am very comfrtable.Thanks Mr.Budi Kurniawan"
2,"great idea, poor execution","the idea behind this device is fabulous- stream music off your PC and play it on your stereo. unfortunately, the execution falls flat- this device is very slow (often takes a minute to navigate to the CD you want to play), occasionally refuses to play songs, has a short controller to player range, and on rare occasions refuses to talk to your computer. the two things it's got going for it: it plays WMA files and it works over a wireless connection. overall, very unimpressed, wish i could return this thing and give it another year to bake."
2,only for geeks,"i am an early adopter.But this unit has taught me new levels of pain.It works, but sometimes it doesn't. So in the middleOthers have said, but here's the downside:a) The remote control is buggy as hell; crashes regularly.b) The unit has to be rebooted regularly also.c) List display is slow and with a large collection I actually print out my list.d) the software for the pc is just plain poor. It was probably bad and ugly in 1984, and it hasn't gotten better. I have wasted many many hours trying to get MP3's retagged (it blows them away), lists created. And it's so slow.All in all, it's a first generation product. It's amazing when it works; and the concept is a winner.So if you are a geek like me, then you can get value out of this. If you are not; wait for version 3. This is version 1."
2,Slow performance,"I credit Creative Labs with an innovative product. I like the display on the remote control. However, it was too slow to navigate through the songs when searching for a song to play."
4,i still Jam to this Tape,"I have had this tape for years. got it from a Fellow Funkateer Buddy who was also a big Cameo Fan. the title track was my jam. the Synth New Wave groove was banging. Your Big Behind Makes Me Blind,your the most. that chorus was crazy and wild. Flirt was Funky with the Guitar in the background and the trademark cameo funky Punchy Bass Groove. but my main cut on this Album was ""be Yourself"" with the Bass Leading Groove and the Vocals were on point,but the Lyrics were strong and felt in my hood as well.always be yourself and do your thing. the Message was loud clear and Funky. the vocals were Funky as well."
4,"Fun, Long, and Bloody...","This game is pretty long, so you get a lot of gameplay. There's plenty of blood, guts, and gore. It is repetative and the story line get a little off, mafia's, nuclear bombs, saving the city blah blah blah. Its fun non-stop killing with special kills throughout the game.It does have a cheat feature, but it won't let you pass the levels using any of them... there are 'mod' programs that will let you cheat and pass the levels.Pretty fun First Person Shooter. B+"
5,This is definitely one of the best!,I bought this CD for one song (Claire Danes Poster) and found out the whole album was great! The beat of every song keeps me interested.
4,Archetypes,"I think this novel was great! To all the readers that say it's just the same old stuff over again. It's the way David Weber has told the story that makes it new and original. If you look at all of our planet's literature isn't it all just the same archetype (general idea or moral that people incorporate into their stories i.e. betrayal, love etc.) told over and over again in different ways? I guess they get bored with every book they read."
2,Advances the overall plot but pointless taken by itself,"There's nothing inherently wrong with Field of Dishonor, except that its too long. The plot moves along a bit, the characters develop a bit but really, it should have been the middle third of another book. Spend 400 pages on it is just silly. I found myself skimming long parts just to get through it. It feels like the authro wrote it in a couple of months."
5,wonderful,"A lot of concreter answers to difficult questions about contemplation. Explains what is so very often difficult to put into words. An excellent help to those who have a serious prayer life, or desire one."
1,no more for baby with large tray,There is no room for baby to sit up correctly between the back of the chair and the large tray. The large tray comes off and you have a little tray acroos the front. But if you need the big tray as I do...do not buy. baby needs the big tray. Also the baby is always reclined back. There is no adjustment to sit baby correctly up straight.I actually went and brought a new high chair.
1,Watch out for Hurling Objects,Watch out for hurling objects with this one. The tray insert is too easily removed and tossed by the baby so there is no benefit in using it. Even the main tray is easily removed by the baby. This is the big concern.It is as simple as the baby reaching underneath and pushing up with the palm of their hands and the tray is off and flying. It is the buttons underneath used to put the tray onto the chair that are the issue. There is very little resistance to push the buttons and from the baby's position they have very good leverage to push them with no trouble at all. Very poor design. This is my first but now that I understand how babies operate I could have pointed this out as a poor design.Our baby is 1-year old.
4,Very good product,"We bought this for our 6 month baby and it came in very handy. Easy to assemble, solid, nice colors, easy to clean.The plastic latch is a bit too tight (you have to press the button really hard to unlatch), but this may be in the end more of a benefit of added safety so that thee baby won't be able to open it easily.If there is something we do not like is the fact that the height of the seat cannot be adjusted in relation to the height of the tray."
5,Cute highchair,"Its a cute highchair, but a bit compact. Its also very hard to find the toys to fit on it."
4,very satisfied,It isn't the euro line which is more compact but nonetheless this highchair is lightweight and easy to put together. Everything else about it is great. Excellent price for this highchair. Definitely getting our money worth.
4,Regency with spirit,"I love reading romance, and I discovered these really good priced debut books when they first came out. I wasn't going to write reviews because I'm not a professional, but I have to say, Ms. Cook is good. She's very good. Her plot is a little weak in parts and her hero goes from actively trying to seduce the veterinarian-to-be heroine to treating her like she's ""used"" goods and it's her fault. It was a bit uneven but very fun to read. Will I be reading her again? Probably."
4,Debut author? Really?,"If this is Kristina Cook's first novel, I can't imagine what her books will be like when she becomes more experienced!I really enjoyed this book. I thought the heroine was unique, quirky, and very likable. The hero wasn't bad either.Although there were a fair number of plot twists, I thought the whole thing flowed together nicely, and the beginning was as satisfying as the ending."
2,Faust's Gold turns to bronze,"A major disappointment as the story was repetitive and boring. Concentrated solely on the East German swimming teams with little original research. Should have been expanded to include other sports and especially the athlete's views on their participation in the doping. No one really believes these athletes were not in some way willing participants especially when the medals where being handed out, but the author does no investigative reporting but only rehashes various court documents and magazine articles."
4,Geek for Mythology?,The shipping and all that was easy no problems. Since I had to get this for a class and it was mandatory! I have no interest in the text and cannot stand to look at it.
2,Classical Myth's myths,"Considering the wealth of knowledge out there, this text is disappointingly male-focused. I would not suggest this text be used in any program."
3,Just enough...,I kind of liked it but for me it is only basic concepts so you need to keep reading from other sources to compliment...
4,Good- But no multiplayer,"When I bought this cheap pack,I was expecting the Pandora Tomorrow multiplayer. Unfortunately, it didn't come with it. A great game though, but heavily scripted. You can only split jump at this one point, go in a vent in this one place, I was expecting multiple ways to get past a point. Overall, if you don't mind the scripting and no included multiplayer, it it golden."
5,Truly a Jewel,"This book, without a doubt, is a must read. I wish many generations, young and old, could find access to this book and read what's in it. Wholly based on the Bible as God's inspired source for teaching us and guiding us into His Kingdom and His Righteousness, this book gives a radical breakdown of what it means to be saved and sanctified. Even if you are not a believer, I would hope you would read this. The truths in this book are the truths of life, just as the Bible is the story of life and is about life. God truly loves you, and as importantly, He wants us to grow to maturity that we might be blessed to be a blessing. I'd give it 10 stars if it let me - see for yourself and be blessed as you grow!"
5,Good cooky book,"This cookbook is several years old. It has many cookie recipes that I don't already have; and I have hundreds, maybe even thousands."
4,A Family's Story of Loss,"This is the biography of Beth Powning. Her first child, Tate, was stillborn at term in the 1970s. Beth struggled with her right to grieve for her son. When her third child Jacob arrived, her long silent grief flooded over her."
1,"1 good song, 4 fillers","Put it in Your Mouth is very creative and entertaining song, one of the best I have ever heard. The other four songs on the album are pure filler. Though this song only contains one good song, I would recommend buying it. This album contains five very diverse songs."
5,Moving overseas to work? You need all the help you can get!,Expatriates do ordinary jobs in extraordinary places. Moving yourself and your family anywhere out of your home country needs careful planning and planning a move to Moscow is a particularly bewildering experience considering all the negative publicity Russia and Russians receive. Travel books just don't focus on the things you need to know. Reading a book such as Expat Guide: Moscow makes it so much easier to imagine what lies ahead and remove a lot of the doubt. I wish I'd had a book like this.
2,price,"As a wood worker I have found this bar clamp to be very good in clamping large pieces. However, the price is similar to the price in our local home centers."
4,Its Good,"The ARRL Microwave Expermenters Manuel is written by people that know their audience. The book is a collection of origional material and articles that have appeared in QST. It is not a text book. It does require some previous exposure to radio theory. It is fun to read. It has lots of pictures and graphs.Its a great book for a technician who wants learn about UHF and amateur radio. These people do a good job of explaining difficult material. Twenty years ago I sat in a metal hut and took microwave classes from one of the authors. When they last twenty years, their is a reason."
4,"Full Size 12"" Therapeutic Memory Foam Mattress","The matteress was as advertised. Shipping was quick and easy. The matteress filled with air right away and was ready to use on the same night as the day I received it. It was a little hard at first, but got softer for the next few days and is now just like I like it. If you have back problems as I do, you may want to give this a try. I am sleaping better than I have in years.Al"
1,Read Return Policy Before You Order,This is a very UNCOMFORTABLE mattress. My husband tried it for a few hours and he had to go see a chiropractor the next day. The foam doesn't let you move and you are just sleeping in a hole and even the pillow sinks. The smell is another story. After reading the reviews we decided to let it air out for a whole week but even after doing that it still smells awful. Finally we want it to return it and found out that there is a 20% restocking fee and we should assume the shipping back to California. WHAT A DISSAPPOINTMENT!!!!!
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT,"I purchased this product for my son with Asperger's syndrome, in an effort to find something as visual as possible to help him with math. The software froze almost immediately. My relatively tech-savvie husband went through the process of getting help fixing this software. The web site contact emailed him twice with help using some sort of ""patch"". A ""patch""? Are you kidding? Why don't you just fix the software so that it works out of the box? The first application of the patch didn't work. The second application DID work, but now I am looking at the software more critically. The tutorial is relatively good, and the avatars are nice and will appeal to children. The activities on the 2nd CD are AWFUL -- very primitive! A child would get bored quickly with the activities and would not find them challenging.Don't even bother . . ."
1,Terrible product I have ever purchased,"I purchased this product couple days ago. When I installed it, my computer did not recognize the CD. I tried to find some support from this company by visiting its web. No luck. It did not tell you anything about support. I could see that All people have the same complaints about installation at its web.This company offers 100% satisfaction guarantee. So I tried to return this product to this company. Unfortunately, on its web, there is no company information,such as company address, phone number you can contact. The only way to contact this company is to use its tech support page email to ask for its contact information.If you want to buy this product, think twice. It may not be as good as it looks and sounds."
1,Waste of Money,"I bought this product to brush up on basic match-algebra math skills for a college assessment exam. The program kept freezing on my core2 Duo processor windows XP machine, so I installed it on my WinXP laptop, same problem. THE PATCH DOES NOT FIX THIS PROBLEM.I loved the animation/voice teaching. Too bad it did not work long enough without freezing. It WOULD HAVE BEEN a wonderful teaching tool.The only math I learned from it was subtracting the cost of the product from my wallet."
1,"just the opener, not the safety eyes","This was the garage door opener and not the safety eyes. The name is misleading, so do not buy this product if you need the safety eyes."
4,a classic but cute lesbian film,"I liked it, I thought it was funny and a little bit mixed up but it was cute and a classic out of a lesbian film. This was not one of the best but it was pretty good."
4,Great duet CD at times reminiscent of Gram Parson Emmylou Harris,"I bought this CD after hearing Party Time on an ""Americana"" sampler CD. Still my favorite cut off the CD, but the whole thing is great. Great arrangements, great pickers backing them up, just a great CD"
3,Just OK,"The jars are a good size and just what I was looking for, however the lids do not close as tightly as I would like. On the first order one of the jars was broken, it took a few days, but they sent a new one without arguement. So good customer service, average product."
3,what?,I gave this a 5 cos it's hard to determine whether it's genius or brainless. very slow . satanic-ritual backround music. I haven't heard any of their other cds. I'm not sure if i plan on doing so yet. any band who puts big sketchy dollar signs on their covers has got something up their sleeve though
5,an explanation of what the muslim cult is really trying to do,the real meaning of the lies of allah and muhammad are telling in their quest to conquer and enslave the world
2,Simple but pleasant,"Actually, a nice story for the younger crowd uninitiated to the complex literature of the medieval period. Short and easily read for the beginner, and considerably less academic than Ms. Pargiter's subsequent tilogies of Wales, Scotland and England."
5,AWESOME!!!,"This is by far one of the best albums Megadeth has released so far. I rank it up there with Countdown to Extinction. Mustaine is on top of things, and so far he is keeping the soul of metal alive. Rock on!!! \m/"
1,How the mighty have fallen,"Up until this album I was a Huge Megadeth fan. I've seen them live twice. But this album just shoves too much of Dave's beliefs in your face, which it is great to speak your mind, but he talks down to everyone.He knows everything, plus his incomprehsible lyrics of his screwed up political views that are beyond democratic or republican, just insane. But I got the point. I dont like it. The solos are boring. No memorable guitar riffs. 10 of the songs sound like he didnt even try. The remake of toute a le monde sounds so stupid, he completely messed it up. Im so dissapointed, Im done with Megadeth!"
4,Strong album with no crippling flaws,"Megadeth really deserves more credit than it gets. After their foray into more commercial, mainstream music, they returned to straight metal with ""The System has Failed"". This is the follow up to that, and it stands shoulder to shoulder with that album. Which is to say, its good.Nice crunching riffs, guitar solos that, even if not as good as their 80's music, still blow away most of Metallica's (yea I said it), combined with Mustaine's slightly less snarling but still very pissed off vocals make for some great listening. The lyrics get a bit silly in places, as some other reviewers have noted (and you'll sleep with the fishes; the answer to all my wishes!) but they're usually meaningful enough.Megadeth is really proving how timeless they are (or I guess its more Mustaine proving how timeless he is....but whatever). Trust me kids, put down St. Anger and pick this one up. It's guranteed to give you a head bangers' neck ache by the end track."
5,thank god for megadeth & dave mustaine,this band is without a doubt one of my favorite bands from the 80s and they keep getting better and better with each album they release dave mustaine is one of my favorite guitar players hes my role model i love how they keep getting better and better with each album they release
5,Mustaine & Co at their BEST!!!,"After the Risk debacle, some fans might have left Megadeth for ""ded."" As Mustaine himself might say, ""Big mistake."" Since then, the band has put out the good ""The World Needs a Hero,"" then a string of GREAT albums, starting with the ultra-heavy ""The System Has Failed"" followed by this equally heavy, fast paced follow up (not to mention the more recent ""Endgame."") Megadeth simply knocks it out of the park with this one, as they have with their last three albums. I've always been a Megadeth fan, but I'll tell you, these last three albums by the band, including this one, have pushed it to a whole new level. Not only has Megadeth gone back to their roots, they've gotten BETTER! Wow. Incredible album from start to finish, highly recommended."
5,Thrash is in!,"Megadeth is back and the album, so far from the tracks I've heard, is definitely a hit. If you like the old Megadeth then you will have fun bangin your head with album because they brought back thrash metal."
5,"Dave Mustaine keeps growling, promising new megadeth album","Having a chance to here two track from this new album due out next year, Gears of War"" and ""Washington is Next"", Dave Mustaine and this version of megadeth continue the classic sound that the Rattleheads worship at the alter of the metal gods. Awaiting with baited breath for this album, and could be an instant top pick of the megadeth catalog. Updates to follow, but this ones a no brainer purchase in my book."
3,i can't decide wether to love it or hate it...,"Its truly a return to form for Megadeth, musically, somewhat recalling Dave's Rust in Peace days, with a bit of the kinda Countdown commercialism that softens the edges a bit too much at points...The thing that bothers me is Dave's right-slanted, ill-informed lyrics (like his claim that the UN did us a disservice by not supporting us on our fierce bombing tirade in Afghanistan) make the album sometimes hard to listen to.Originally i made a comment that dave should keep his politics to himself, but i agree this would be very un-Megadeth-like. However, i do think his politics have shifted a bit, and, to me at least, it was a bit unsettling."
4,sphyngomanometer set,This is adequate manual sphyngomanometer set for home/ professional use. Came promptly with adequate stethoscope.Excellent value for money.Must know how to use.
2,Warning: Shapes are Small Enough to Choke?,"I want to love this toy, I really do. From the high quality eco-friendly wood to the happy workers pictured on the insert, it should be a winner. I was a litte shocked how small the shapes are however. Unfortunately 4 of the 6 shapes are small enough to easily fit though a toilet paper tube. Maybe I'm overly paranoid, but I thought that was the test for a choking hazard. I don't think that changes much by the listed 18 months. I love the swing up doors though, so we are keeping it to work on putting things away and taking things out with our 9 month old twins. I know they will get a kick out of banging the doors open and shut. Just another 1/2-3/4 inch diameter on all the shapes and this would be perfect. The Wonderworld Peek-A-Boo ball has been a huge hit, so I will keep buying from this company. Bummed that this one can't be used as it was meant to be."
1,Could not finish the book,I could not get beyond the first two chapters the plot was unbelievable and the syle not appropriate to the genre.
5,Great adventure with greater values,"""Alone Yet Not Alone,"" is one of the most readable books I have ever read. After chapter three it is impossible to lay it down. It assumes Christian virtues, values, and actions and presents them in such a way that it makes you want to assimulate them into your own life. It is a definite must read for all early to late teens. It probably will become a staple in the Christian families library."
2,OK,"I only bought this CD because I love track 7-""Love song"". It's not one of my favorite cds, but some songs do grow on you."
5,A childhood favorite...,"I grew up eating this soup and it is delicious! I am so excited to see it on Amazon because the last place I bought it was in Puerto Rico! The taste is very distinct. You really don't notice the tripe flavor, but sometimes the way the tiny little pieces look might distract you. Since it's a Campbells soup, everything is fairly minced up, but the vegetables are tasty. The broth is truly unique. There is a hint of the bell pepper, black pepper and oregano that season it, but it's much more complex. I'd love the recipe, but would probably make it with oxtails instead of tripe. Definitely delicious!"
5,Great Knives,"I purchased one of these knives previously and adore it. It is well balanced, easy to clean and very, very sharp. It has maintained its edge for over 2 years now.I bought this set as a gift, and the recipient was thrilled. In fact, 2 other people at the party asked me where I got the knives.Just be warned that these knives are so sharp that extreme caution is needed."
5,Electrifying!!,"This film, shot in Texas in June of 1995, features a whole host of talented musicians. The littany of names is enthralling. Buddy Guy, B.B. King, Bonnie Raitt, Jimmy Vaughan, Robert Cray and Eric Clapton, who was nominated for best male rock performance in 1997 at the Grammys for his performance. Each musician performs his own incredible piece and the film also includes each performer's reflections on Stevie and all culminating to an incredible blues guitar jam with each musician having a solo. Filled with beautiful slides, riffs and solos and heartfelt thoughts each artist pays tribute to Stevie Ray Vaughan in his own way. A befitting tribute to a once in a life time bluesman."
5,SRV Tribute,"Clips of SRV, Raitt, Clapton, BBKing, Robert Cray, Buddy Guy and John Vaughan, Dr John on the piano Double Trouble all helping each other out in a great concert.This is one of the best since the Last Waltz"
1,Don't Waste Your Time With It,The unions have bought this book and they know exactly what management is going to do. I wasted my companies money on this book.
1,Unsatisfactory linear polarizers,"I bought 3 identical linear polarizers. I was expecting polarizers which would let pass almost no light when turned 90 from one another, because I wanted to perform the impressive experiment where one introduces a third polarizer between the first two, and gets back some light: the ""home experiment"" demonstrating a quantum mechanics effect. But a pair turned at 90 created only a slight shadow. So I returned the three polarizers."
5,"High Quality Filter, Great Price","This is a very well made filter. Glass with metal ring.Thin, so it doesn't cause to much of a problem with vignetting when shooting with your zoom lens at wide angle settings.Overall I am very satisfied. Great value for a well made filter. This IS a circulating polorizing filter. Does a great job at capturing those blue skies and filtering out reflections in water, glass and uv rays. No photographer should be without this lens."
2,Very weak polarizer,"This is a linear polarizer, as opposed to a circular polarizer that people usually buy for SLRs, so this is somewhat of a specialized review.I wanted a linear polarizer since by stacking two and rotating them relative to each other, you can block some or all of the light transmitted, like a variable neutral density filter. With good polarizers, this works great. When the filters are at 90 degrees to each other, no light is transmitted at all. But with these Tiffens, very little light was blocked when crossing them at 90 degrees. Bottom line: the polarization ratio of these filters is very weak, meaning that these polarize light only a little bit. See similar comments about the 77 mm Tiffens."
3,It's ok.,The polarizer works jut fine. The thing I don't like about it is that there is not a lot of depth to hold my lens cap on It's barely holding on!
1,Cup size small band too tight,I ordered a 44D and it is too small. I am glad I did not remove the tags because it is going back right after the holidays.
1,Was this book a first draft?,"Where oh where do I begin? First off, I'm glad I bought it used, but I really wished I had checked it out of the library. I know that this book wasn't meant to be deep or anything like that. I like fluffy reads as much as the next chick, but even fluff should be entertaining and whisk you out of your own reality. When I read this, I felt that I was being given more of a synopsis of a book and not that real story itself. The author just rushes the reader along from scene to disjointed scene like Officer Barbrady in South Park (""Move along, nothing to see here""). While an informal narrative is nice, this book was just too chatty for me, and the inclusion of the abusive boyfriend just felt more like an afterthought than a real part of Vivian's character. The author really should have taken the time to write a second draft, because Vivian's character and the story really had the potential to be interesting."
3,Did I miss something?,"I read The Autobiography of Vivian after reading a recommendation by Venus Williams. I thought that Venus probably doesn't get to read all that much, so if she liked it... Anyway, I thought this read more like a diary than an actual novel. The action is slow-moving and we don't really get to find out about the -real- Vivian until about 100 pages into the book. While the style may be fresh, I found it a bit too ""MTV""--you know, designed for short attention spans and for those who thrive on quirky one word responses. Vivian could be a marvelous heroine, but the pace and chattiness just get in the way. I know that many have really enjoyed the book, but I just found it to be rather cumbersome and a poor reflection of the young adult experience."
2,Disappointment from a really big fan of Garrison Keillor!,"Bought the audio of ""Guy Stories"" thinking it would be like most of the audio tapes I have from this very talented story teller.I guess I expected more humor in this tape/book but instead all we found were some rather weird stories that really did not seem to be the kind of stuff we are used to hearing from this man. I am sorry I bought these tapes, not a big amount of money involved but still total disappointment by the content; not up to what we expect from this man.Thanks"
1,Two hours of my life that I will never get back...,"I had never read any of Keillor's books, but if this one was represenative, I'll avoid him completely. The stories were boring and pointless."
4,book of guys:stories,"prefer lake wobegon but always enjoy mr. keillor's stories and his readings of them. he has issues, but that is not always bad, sometimes he is just differant.i always like to see a geek make good. if you are lucky in married life, the odds are pretty good, you married a geek. carry on mr. keillor"
3,"so far so good, but no handle","it seems fine, and fit fine, but I'm used to these double packages coming with a handle so it's easier to place and remove the lower filter. this one didn't have it.also, it may be interesting to note the amazon price went up about ten dollars in the past year, so I'm going to be searching elsewhere to price check. (drumroll) ah yes, I did find a hot tub warehouse product for a good $15 or so less (I was buying two).big Amazon fan, but I just bought myself a decent dinner :)"
4,Slick like this,"This CD presents a great mix of old school and new school, heavy and smooth rap. From the jazzy sounds of Digable Planets on Slick Like That (which is one of my favorite all time tracks) to the comedic rhymes of FatLip, Slim Kid Tre and the rest of Pharcyde on Passin Me By, this CD offers more variety than the average compilation. A good early nineties sampler, I recommend following up this disc with albums like LabCabinCalifornia (Pharcyde) and Blowout Comb (Digable)."
2,"Nice tool box, however.","Nice looking box that seems durable, however,I recieved the item damaged and tried to contact shoplet 3 times (email and phone) and they never responded. Now Im working with a dented up tool box....I should have gone to sears."
2,"No, thanks.","I'm only reading this book because I'm a completist. Frankly, none of the characters are depicted in character (although it seems that the show can't really seem to decide what's ""in character"" and ""out of character"" either), and the only likeable characters get maybe two or three lines of dialogue. Throw in a painfully predictable plot and some boring aliens, and you have A) A typical Voyager episode, and B) A mediocre Voyager novel. Please, Greg, let Diane ghost-write next time."
1,Don't get this book,"Instead of offering my daughter constructive ways to deal with anger, this book gave her the idea to just run away. It doesn't offer any helpful ways to handle anger, and Little Critter never gets punishment for all the naughty things her does in the book, including saying he's going to run away."
2,"Doesn't help to deal with ""mad""","I understand the point of this book and my son (age 3) and I have talked about it after we finish reading it, but all that its seemed to do for us and his being ""mad"" is that now he says that he is ""so mad, that he thinks he will run away"". Not exactly what I was hoping to teach him. Perhaps he is just at that age where he really doesn't know what he is feeling and just likes to say things for effect - I was just hoping for a better message in the book, not that his plans for running away after being ""so mad"" were foiled because he wanted to go play with his friends. I see that the book is for ages 4-8 - perhaps that is where the problem lies, the book is too advanced for a 3 year old who really pays attention to what he is reading."
5,Great sound,"This is quite heavier than I realized but gives a beautiful sound. At first I thought it would be too loud when I got it and I made the bell sound but when it's actually outside and the wind moves it the sound is much quieter. It takes quite a good breeze to get it to chime. It is not as loud as when you listen through the ""listen here"" option. We love it because it doesn't overpower the backyard when we are sitting out on our deck. We've got it hanging from a tree limb about 25-30 feet from the deck. Definitely would recommend!"
5,I LOVED,"I just loved this CD, and if someone want some gift idea for the holidays, I deeply suggest this CD, it rocks..."
3,"""The Contender""","Alfred, the high school drop out working at grocery store, get harassed By Major and his gang member. Alfred was asked to rob the grocery story with gang and Alfred's best friend, James, went to the robbery with the gang. Alfred forgot to tell James about the new buglar alarm in the grocery store so James was cought by a cops. To be someone special, Alfred went up the stare to the Donettelli's gym to start boxing. He get physically and mentally stronger. (...)"
4,The Knock-out Book...,"This book kept me interested as well as taught me a lot about boxing. I wanted to keep reading even after I was supposed to stop (I read it for school)! I thoutht the ending stunk since it kinda left you hanging, but it was a good book overall. It taught you a lot about boxing and it was fun to read. I had lots and lots of fun sitting on my couch reading it when I had to get through a number of chapters by the next day. Parts if the book were really boring and some make you shudder but when the book was good it stayed good for a long time! ""The Contender"" was a great book!"
4,Very good book,"I have read this book a couple of times and I find it very interesting. One of the points I love about this book is the development of the characters in the book. This book is a great book for the 7-10 grade ages, but also great to read at any age. I also found this book very inspiring and uplifting. Although the ending is not how i would have liked it, it is a belivible ending however. I recommend this book to any reader looking for a uplifting book."
2,Contender review,"I thought that the Contender was just an o.k. book. I do not enjoy reading, at all. Although the book was about boxing it never really caught my attention. It was one of those books that you would consier ""dull"". I feel that I was very generous to have given this book 2 stars."
2,The Contendor,"This book was all about history. It is also about a very fun sport, boxing. The author of this book was not a very creative writer, he made this book pretty dull. Alfred was a very good boxer though. he won two matches, tied one and lost one. I thought the book had a very good point, but it was not written in a very good form. I am wery glad that James ended up getting help at the hospital. All in all, I think that this book was a very interesting book, but it wasn't the greatest."
4,The Contender,"I rated the Contender four stars because it was a really good book. The story talked about the troubles of Alfred, a kid growing up in Harlem, and the way he deals with them by boxing. Alfred, with help from Donatelli, learns to try his hardest and not give up. I liked this book because it was about a kid and had things I could relate to, like peer pressure and problems with friends. The Contender is a great easy-to-read book that you can really get into. I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys boxing, but you don't have to like boxing to like this book."
3,The Contendor's Challenge,The author was Robert Lipstye. The book Contendor was a very intresting book. It was about a man named Alfred. Alfred became very intrested in boxing. As he became more intrested in boxing he was trained and entered a tournament. Alfred waas a high school drop out the book talks about Alfred life in high school and he his as a drop out. I would recommend this book for middle school students because it has words and meanings that some people wouldn't understand.
3,My opinion of The Contender,"The ContenderI enjoyed this book. It was interesting because it showed how you could mess your life up if you choose to take drugs. Alfred, the main character, was a teen boy how grew up with his aunt Pearl in a bad part of town. He is usually getting into fights and stuff. My opinion of this book was excellent. James Alfred's friend and him have a little cave they go to for safety when they are in trouble. This book may change some minds of kids who want to grow up and not do too much with here life. Alfred always thought he would do nothing with his life, but in the end he did he became a Contender."
3,the contender,%The contender % By Robert Lipsytewas a book about boxing. I really didn't like the book too much because of its lack of details and its boring storyline. Alfred is highschool drop out who works at a small supermarket. One night he's friends plan to rob the supermarket. Alfred decides not to but he forgets to tell he's friends about the new alarm. The next day he's friends get caught and Alfred decides to learn boxing. He can't box till he goes through vigorous training and the ending you need to read yourself but it is`nt that great because it`s so short. So if you like boxing this is a book you might want to try.
4,The Greatest,"In the beginning of The Contender, I was not amazed. I wanted to read a book about slavery and hard times so that I could learn about my ancestors. Boxing is not something I really like and don't usually hear about. I really like basketball, baseball, kickball and other sports that people my age play. But as we got more and more into the book, I noticed that the book was about making the right choices in your life and hanging out with the right crowd. THe only part that was not good to me was when Alfred's friend gets on drugs. And when he takes money from ALfred to get a fix. If Alfred was ever jumped again by Major, Alfred would probably kill Major!"
1,The Contendr,"I didn't care much for the book, because I don't like to read. Also another reason why I didn't like it was because I do not like boxing all that much, but the reason why I rated this book a whole whopping one star is because Alfred gets in fights with other people. But I would not request this book to anyone because there are only a few good parts, and the ending really stinks."
5,The Contender,the book was exciting to read it was the best book i have ever read the best part is when he begans to boxs and goes to the gym and meets henery.
4,The Contender,"The Contender By Robert LipsyteThe book The Contender was one of the best books I ever read. I really liked how Alfred (the main character) never gave up on any of his goals. He would never quite or give up. When thing were not going his way, he never gave up. And during the whole book he cleaned himself up and got his act together.I also liked the book because Alfred was a boxer and that was the main reason I started the book. But as I read the book it was about more that boxing, it was about a man and his hard life and the choices he makes."
2,The Contender,"The book I read was ""The Contender"" by Roger Lipsyte. It was ok. It was a good book in the way that it showed the hardships of some African-Americans living in the ghetto. But, it was kind of hard to follow who all of the characters are. My favorite part of the book was when Alfred had his very first fight. It would have had to have been very hard going through all of that training and practicing, just to be a boxer. They had to go through a very hard schedule to get in shape and to become athletic. If you want to read a book about boxing, I would suggest this."
2,The Contender,"I found this book hard to keep up with. The first half of the book was really boring and it only stated to get good at the end. My favorite charactor was Jelly Belly, he was interesting and and a sense of humor. If someone was feeling bad he would always have a way of making them feel better or if someone was making fun of another person he would stick up for them even if he din't know the person."
2,THE REVIEW FOR CONTENDER,My opinion of the book THE CONTENDER was don't waste your time. If you dont like sports than you probably won't like this book. I think that the author had no idea what the Projects are like. Overall the book was okay. If you like a book about somebody striving To make themselves better than there is a chance that you might like this book. To me you're wasting your time if your reading this book. Normally I like most of the books that I read but THE CONTENDER IS TERRIBLE.
3,Molly's Contender Review,"""The Contender"" was a fairly good book. The writing was superb and you could really get a feel for the atmosphere of Harlem, NY. All the characters were portrayed very realistically and their personalities were original and identifiable. The only complaint I have was that it most certainly not long enough - I felt that I didn't have time to get attached to the characters enough to really care what happened to them. Robert Lipsyte is a great author, but perhaps he ought to put his talents to better use by making his books longer and appealing to a wider range of audiences. Books about wrestling/boxing/fighting, no matter how well-written, aren't all that interesting to a non-sports fan. I'll give it three stars!"
4,The Contender,"The Contender is a pretty good book. It talks about a person in his late teens who takes up boxing. This book takes place in Harlem, New York in the 1960s and it is very realistic in the atmosphere of Harlem. The 17 year old, Alfred lives with his aunt in a rough neighborhood with many drug addicts and rough people, and has to deal with racism. However, Alfred becomes a boxer and that is what the story talks about, his training and experiences. The book shows how hard it is to become a contender. My favorite parts are the fights that Alfred takes place in. They are very realistic and are unpredictable."
3,Nice Mix,"Like June, Jo was one of the classic singers of the 50's and 60's. This is some of her older stuff and includes (apparently) her vocal work with the modernaires. No liner notes so can't tell. If record companies take the time to issue the cd they should give us some basic information. There are no doubt more recordings available e.g. Corinthin ? label that are more up to date, but Jo's voice was a classic and can't miss if ""old fogey"
5,Excellent tea!!!,"This stuff is great. I'm a grad student, and this stuff not only tastes great, but has just the right amount of caffein."
2,Haven't recieved in a month!,"Im not a tea lover, but this Tastes better than I thought! I'm looking forward to trying other Yerba mate flavors....like chocolate! Sounds delicious!!"
5,Great stuff!,"I tried this tea after sampling one from one of my co-workers, it is great! I ordered a few boxes off of amazon since I am an avid coffee drinker and wanted to try a different alternative. Well, I haven't drank or felt the desire to drink any coffee since my first cup of yerba mate this morning. It also suppressed my appetite; I was not running to the vending machines for my usual 3 PM pick me up. Definitely give it a try, it is very good, and not bitter at all, some teas if I steep them too long, they become bitter, making me gag, not this tea, the bag sits in the cup all till the last drop.I love it!"
1,"Smells like an ashtray, tastes like one too!","I have no idea why anyone likes this tea. It literally tastes and smells like an ashtray. When they say ""smokey"" flavor, they aren't kidding. I bought this box of tea from a local grocer and I could barely finish the package. That being said, mate gives you just as much of a lift as caffeine. Buy a box of Lipton's tea (or Tazo tea, even better) you'll be much happier."
3,Cross of Saint George,"I enjoyed this book, but did not think the story line was as strong as some of the earlier books in this series. I had a feeling the author was writing stories just to extend the series a few more volumes. But, since I am a Bolitho fan, I will probably end up buying all of them."
3,They're much better with a back-strap,"Mephisto needs to make these with a back-strap again also. I had a pair years ago, and they are much more secure on the feet while going up and down stairs or walking at a quick pace than without the back-strap. I've also noticed that their footbeds have gotten much narrower over the years, and so now would like to see them offer wide widths."
2,corazon salvare (monica+juan),"I am very sory for Juan.I love ""corazon salvare"", I love monica and Joan.I don't be live this actor is died.I cry this mexican TV star.Good be with he!I cry for this star.my love star!I'm sow sory!please help hee family in this moments.Good by Eduardo Palomo, Good by my dear star!"
5,a good musical,"I heard most all of the version of Kismet but this one I think is the best one and most enduring and endearing. I'd highly recommedn it. Richard Kiley is one of the bst vocalists ever in my opinio. The rest of the cast is great too. Doretta Morrow, Alfered Drake, all wonderful singers and performers. Also JoanDiener. It's agreat cd as it's digitally remastered and in best quality. It capturees the true performance. All the songs are beautiful especially, ""Stranger in Paradise."" It's a treat for any broadway theatre lover."
2,"Light, Not for Kitties","This book provides a light overview of Catwoman. And I mean light overvwiew. I noticed that most of the examples used by the author, Scott Beatty, to outline Selina's life and who she is comes from stories by Jeph Loeb. Primarily Batman: The Long Halloween, Batman Dark Victory and Batman Hush.Please note Jeph Loeb has to have done one of the worst portrayals Catwoman ever. His portrayal of her is very unflattering...he writes her as if she belongs in an adult movie. Trust me Catwoman is much more than that.If you are really interested in Catwoman I suggest that you pick up ""Catwoman, The Life and Times of a Feline Fatale"" by Suzan Colon. Then you'll get the real deal on who Selina ""Catwoman"" Kyle is."
3,A Too Light History On the Cat that bothers the Bat,"I have enjoyed most of the DK guides to DC characters, however I really don't think Catwoman could support a whole book on her own, and this proves the point.The only reason she got this book solo (where a Bat Villian like the Joker deserves his own guide so much more) is because of the truly forgetable movie and the push to support it.Had they included a section on the TV and other movie Catwomen maybe they could have gotten away with it. But there just wasn't enough material to be satisfying. Even at the lower Amazon price Idon't find it worth it except for the real bat-fantatics out there.Another point with the DC DK guides that fustrates me to no end is that if they quote a story line in an entry somewhere in the book they should identify what issue it came from in case someone wants to read that story.My verdict: A good buy from a remaineder bin otherwise turn off the Batsignal."
3,Roses,The previous reviews were on mark....the lead in before they met was a bit long and so made thx story a bit boring at the beginning .I found that twin brother Jamil was very harsh and heartless both in his ruling and with his relationship with his mother.I am not into this female subservient role that exists in this kind of country..so I found it difficult to truly enjoy. The author did however capture the details of such a society as to allow the reader a glimpse into that kind of life style
4,Another Lindsey Hit!!!!,"I loved this book! Even though I found the plot very inlikely, I couldn't help but fall in love with the characters. Chantelle's resistence and Derek's passion make for a sexy, alluring story. The battle that they fought was a joy to read, and I couldn't put the book down!"
4,"More Lindsey, please!","This was a really good book--one I couldn't put down. The story was frustrating, and Derek a bit knuckle-headed at times, but a good read."
1,Stranger in this movie,This movie was a total dudd.... dont buy it... Im warning you.... I bought it from target yesterday and I wanna wrap it back up and send it back to them... no good storyline... the girl practically had sex with one of her mothers boy toys and he used her but what really made me mad is the girl tries to black mail him for the job... and after he uses her she wants the job back...WTF? if my boss used me... i wouldnt want to work for him anymore....duh! Viveca fox was the mother who was dating alot of men but was having marital problems with her husband who was clifton powell(he is in every play) they had a daughter Harmony who was played by one of the girls who use to sing with the group xscape.... anyway she was so distraught over her parents pending divorce(Harmony looked too grown to be living at home and crying over her parents divorce.... Im just saying)....dont get the movie... If you do make sure you dont pay $10 like I did.... more like $ 1.50
2,Misleading description; disappointed in TX.,Ther are only eleven actual songs on this CD. The rest of the titles are discussed in an interview with VG. Where's the music!
4,"A funny, funny man.","Walter Kirn is a very amusing writer, and this American fable certainly reflects that. You can read the story synopsis from Publisher's Weekly above, so suffice it to say that this book exudes a false nostalgia for a true America that (of course) never existed. Big obvious targets like religion and consumerism are lampooned, but there is also a more subtle wit weaving around the dialogue and even in Mason (the narrator's) voice.One problem with comic novels is that the joke usually gets tired, or the plot gets so silly, one loses interest. By writing Mission to America in the form of a folktale, Kirn is able to elude this problem to a degree. And by being an extraordinarily witty writer, he may be on the verge of joining others who have transcended the form, like Joseph Heller and Roger Kaputnik."
3,Came in two sections!,"My disabled roomate got a box of this in the mail and I liked it enough to get my own for working my arms while setting on my ass infront of the TV. Previous comments made me wary about it because they said it came pre-cut, but my roomate's did not so I gave it a try. I got a total of 25 feet, one piece being about 9 feet and one being about 15 or 16 feet. The short one is good for one arm exorcises and the long one for two, but I would have rather cut the tubing myself to suit my own purposes instead of adapting to what someone else figured I wanted. This is why it gets 3 stars and not 4 or 5. Inconsistency in product condition. The tubing itself was free of cracks and cuts (though a bit bulgy and wavy in places) but I wanted to cut it to my own needs."
5,Great for stroller or car,Our son received this when he was 3 months old and still loves it now (he's 10 months). I would highly recommend this toy and it's great because you can also attach it to the stoller and not worry about it getting lost!
4,Great Toy!,"This is a great toy. It is safe and has kept my daughter's interest with it's bright colors, noises and flexibility.Definitely a winner!"
1,There Are Better Lamaze Toys Out There,"After my son's positive reaction to Lamaze's Play and Grow Tucker and a Lamaze Hippo, I figured I'd try another Lamaze toy. I seem to have pushed my luck.While other Lamaze toys are relatively gender neutral, this one seems somewhat more feminine--which isn't, in itself, the end of the world.The big problem is that it also seems pointless. When I introduced it to my son, he didn't seem to know what he was supposed to do with this sun/moon thing. He couldn't operate the squeaker in one of the tentacles...and he seemed almost as confused by the fact that this sun/moon thing had tentacles as I was. The look on his face said it all: ""what the heck is this thing?""The most action this toy sees is when my son throws it out of his way so that he can get to toys he actually wants to play with."
5,One of the best anime series: period,"This is an anime series you can't help but love. When I first saw this series, it instantly became my favorite. Now I've been on a mad shopping spree collecting anything I can about OMG. My recommendation is very simple: buy this tape, now."
5,"A Beautiful, Fun-Filled, Heart-String Tugging Masterpiece!","This is a dynamite series. Oh My Goddess is a five-part anime full of wonderful music, beautiful art and warm, human characters. I am a 46 year old father of two teenagers and I own the Japanese language (English subtitled) version of these videos. There are no fighting robots or splashes of blood... just a well engineered romance with many a twist and turn. I enjoy the language and the energy that went into the making of this anime. Also... check the internet. Search for the characters in this story: Belldandy, Urd, Skuldo, Keichi. You will discover the huge following of fans behind ""Oh My Goddess"". You might also like the animes ""Tenchi Muyo"" and ""You're Under Arrest"". Fun characters, excellent quality... Good stuff!"
5,^-^ Too much to say,"This episode is great and the art is spectacular. It was funny and I couldn't help watching it over four times in a row (ok ok, so I'm wacko). I also like the clips of other anime they have at the end of the video (bet you didn't know that was there). I couldn't help listening to the theme song on my cd either."
5,Where's vol. 3?,"This is a great series, I'm still waiting for vol 3. Check out Love Hina too, that's really funny."
5,Ah! My Goddess,I really enjoyed this Anime story. I watch it on You tube. It is about a boy meet a goddes and have her as his girlfriend. And they did fall in love.
4,Excelente anime,"Siguiendo con las aventuras de las diosas, excelente comedia romantica riendo de las desventuras de Keiichi tratando de declararle su amor a Belldandy. Estre anime es muy recomendable."
2,Wheeled Massage Table Carrying Case,"Though I like the convenience of being able to carry all of my necessities for working in my carrying case, that is about all that this product offered. The material the product is made of is not the strong quality of material that is needed to lift a table in and out of a vehicle. The material started to rip apart after the second use. I was disappointed for only being able to get two uses out of it."
5,"So far, so good.","I have really liked using this carrying case. It is functional and easy to use. I do wish the maker had placed another handle opposite of the top one, but really it doesn't make too much difference. The carrying strap is what I use most to move the case around and the wheels make it super light weight. For the price, this is an excellent buy."
1,Remote gets into an endless test mode loop,I have used this remote for less than 6 months and it gotten itself into a mode (test) that it can't come out of. I've checked the web and it seems this is a fairly common issue and no one has the answer to resolve it other than sending it back to the manufacturer.
3,Remote,This is not easy to program but when I did get it programed it worked ok on most devices except those that use a single button for on and off and then it hung up a couple times and would do nothing until I removed the batteries for a few seconds and then reinstalled. Returned for refund but would have gotten a replacement except for the one button on and off problem. When I would set one button macro to turn everything off my samsung dvd would turn on (when it was off) as it was one of the devices that use the same button on its remote to turn on and off. The learn feature worked great. I did talk to the tech line a couple time for set up information and they very helpful and knowledgeable about their remote.
5,I love this remote,"I second what most other users have written about convenience and programmability. Here are some additional points:- I have had the remote for just over a year. It still works perfectly and looks almost like the day I bought it.- The rubbery plastic that the remote is covered with means it is pleasant to hold, it doesn't scratch tables or become scratched itself.- The remote's signal is very strong. I can point it in almost any direction in my living room and the signal still goes through to my devices. This is a relief after using some finicky remotes that had to be pointed EXACTLY at the devices they controlled.- The batteries need changing every 4-5 months. Not bad, not great.- Some remotes have LCD buttons (which give you no tactile feedback), and some remotes have regular buttons (which you can't change the labels on). The MX-500 eliminates the disadvantages of either approach by combining regular buttons with LCD labels."
5,customizable remote,"Universal Remote Control MX-500 10-Device LCD Viewscreen Remote Control with Joystick OperationI am very happy with my MX-500. It's easy to customize and to use. Overall, I'm very satisfied with my purchase."
4,Remote,"Not as fancy as some remotes, but for the price, it is a great deal.Easily programmed and controls everything."
1,Disappointing. . .,"I seldom review books, but this one is so disappointing that I felt obligated too. The key thing to note about this book is that Thomas Sterling is not the author, but the ""Editor"" of the book. Sterling assembled a number of short, loosely related articles and tries to pass them off as a comprehensive book on beowulf clusters running on linux. This book offers no real guidance on building a beowulf cluster or working with an existing one. At best, this book only offers a very general overview of cluster computing."
4,Music to facilitate a healing trance...,"This is a nice album of music designed for Reiki healing. It has a steady, flowing rhythm that lulls you into a relaxed, trance-like state. This music is ideal for its intended purpose, although I would not use it for general listening or background ambience. I have used it many times during Reiki healing groups and have found it suitable for myself and pleasant to participants."
3,Not nearly as good as the Original,"We have several of the Harold books, but the ones written by Crockett Johnson are far superior. This is a cute tale of Harold and his dog Lilac scuba diving. The original book was in line drawings in black and white (well, purple and white) and these are done in full blown color leaving nothing to the child's imagination."
5,Very effective and efficient little meter,"In a few words, this is a small, light, efficient moisture meter. Carry it around when you are out to buy wood for your projects. Simple and easy to use, I checked its readings with bigger moisture meters and they are pretty consistent. It does put two small puncture holes in the wood being tested, but I still prefer this type of moisture meters to the electro-magnetic ones (I also own the smaller Wagner)."
5,The Bridges of Madison County,I love this movie. I can watch this movie over and over. This is a must for any movie collection.
5,Great Sketches for Quick Ideas,"This little reference book contains hundreds of sketches of basic mechanisms for creating different motions. Tons of configurations for gears, pulleys, friction wheels, etc. The bulk of the information in this book is portrayed in pictures.A great way to generate powerful ideas! Anyone who's mechanically minded would enjoy flipping through this book. Could be a useful tool for an engineer/inventor.This book was originally printed in the 1800's, it has a interesting sense of history to boot."
3,Less interesting than it should be,"This is a small book, my fault for not reading the dimensions. There are multiple (6 to 8) diagrams per page, so each figure is small. A bigger problem is that there is no context for the movements. One can follow how everything within a figure meshes, but you would be hard pressed to see how some of these would fit into a real machine. Also, there are many repeats with minor variations on mechanisms."
3,Could be better,As an inventor I have found this book most helpful to thumb through in idle moments when an idea might jump out. I am always left desiring more comprehensive textual discussion of each mechanism. It is good enough to get an idea of the mechanism but plan on searching the web for additional detail. It would be more helpful if there was a discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of each mechanism with cross reference to alternatives. 3D pictures from a variety of angles would also be helpful.
2,A repackaging of a book I already had,"I have previously bought the similar1800 Mechanical Movements, Devices and Appliances (Dover Science Books)and really loved it. I was looking forward to another 507 juicy mechanical drawings. I was deeply disappointed when it turned out that this is nothing more than 25% of the exact drawings out of the 1800 book, with slightly more prose written per drawing. If you think you'll like these drawings, you may as well buy all of them."
3,507 Mechanical Movements,"This is largely a historical book with quick mention of a large number of mechanisms using diagrams from either patent documents or old publications. While many of these mechanisms are still relevant in mechanical engineering today, the presentaion style positions this book more as a coffee table curiosity than a reference book. I do recognise that it is a low priced book and therefore we should not expect too much from it. It is, however, easy to be seduced by a title and have higher expectations."
5,A great collection from a great band!,"Wow! As a longtime fan of The Fall, I was kind of afraid of a ""best-of"" collection. After all, this is a band that has so many records out that I need a seperate storage unit just for them. Well, I was pleasantly surprised by this set. It is an extremely nice selection of singles, B-sides and fan favorites. This also includes a DVD containing an interview with Mark E Smith and, even though I haven't watched it yet (hey, I just received the set yesterday!!) I'm sure it will be entertaining. When has Mr Smith said anything that wasn't?I could easily reccomend this to anyone who is just starting to look at their somewhat daunting catalog. This collection will give you an easy to digest overview of one of the most entertaining and longest lasting bands of the rock era."
3,"A Cute, Funny Date Movie.","I don't know why the other reviewers were so hard on this movie. Perhaps they expected more from a ""Sandra Bullock"" flick. I enjoyed it. It's a cute and funny movie about a dense thief and his smart girlfriend trying to evade the law.Okay, it's not as fast-paced as MIDNIGHT RUN and Yaphet Kotto is not as funny as the FBI man trying to catch them. It also loses a little steam towards the end. But the tete-a-tete and chemistry between Denis Leary and Sandra Bullock works. Actually, by focusing on Bullock one might miss what a great job Leary has done in playing the beleagured boyfriend.The digital transfer of the DVD is excellent judging from the stunning New England scenery. It is available for a bargain price and is worth every penny."
3,Sandra Bullock,"Again, this is one of Sandra's earlier DVD'S. DVD arrived timely and in good condition."
5,Bawdry and different!,this movie is a hit in out house. We drag it out a few times a year and really enjoy it!! No subliminal messages no preaching just entertainment!!! I liked Sandra Bullock in this role! Denis Leary was great. Good flick!
3,"5 Stars for the show, 2 stars for the recording","Let me start off by saying: Show Boat is an amazing show that everyone should see. It was the first modern-day musical of its kind (made in 1927!). However, this is not a good recording AT ALL. I borrowed this cd from the library and i thank God everytime i listen to it that i didn't buy it. The best thing this cd has going for it is John Raitt. He is a great singer with a very nice voice. The man who plays Joe (forgot his name) is surprisingly weak in ""Ol' Man River"". The woman who plays Julie (forgot her name also) is just plain annoying in ""Bill"". The song is sung WAYYY too slow and without any feeling whatso ever. Don't buy this cd..., [it's] only 45 minutes of music. Don't let this review persuade you from buying a show boat cd, just don't buy this particular version of it!. Enjoy!, or not--"
4,An interesting release,"I have been obsessed with this band for a few years now, and I must say that although I would probably rate How To Measure A Planet higher, this cd is much more listenable. The songs are shorter and more to the point and are a bit more rockin. At the same tme they are a little less memorable. The recording sounds a lot different too. A great cd none the less."
5,books,"My Sons Really enjoy it They want to hear the story every night, even as they get older they still listen"
2,2 stars is being generous,"growing up, I was taught that if I didn't have anything nice to say, I shoulldn't say anything at all. That alone should tell you what I think of this cd. the beats weren't too hot and the lyrics weren't even room temperature. If Mr. Serv On puts out another album after this one, I wish him all the luck in the world, but on this one, don't waste your money its rather stinky."
4,Reviews for Tiffen,The research I conducted before my purchase showed that Tiffen was a brand one can rely on. A trusted name in its' field.
4,Excellent!,"Youngsters Martin Sheen and Sissy Spacek kill in the Midwest. Based on a true story, Badlands is an excellent interpretation of being an outsider and floundering in the currents of change that surround and define us."
2,Hard to follow,"I started reading this book a couple of weeks ago, it was recommended to me by a friend. I find it very hard to understand and quite boring. I have been skipping chapters trying to get to one that makes some sense. Does anyone else agree or disagree with me, I would like to know. This may be a minor thing but it is also hard to keep the darn book open to read it."
1,Defective Printing,"I received a defective copy of this book. The first page in the book was 139. All of the printing signatures were in the correct order from that point to the end of the book on page 384. The cover and spine appeared perfectly normal, as if they were designed for a book with 248 pages in it."
2,A Title Only for the Initiated,"Rawles attempt to write a novel is just that, an attempt. Yes, he tells a story that somewhat engages the reader and does a somewhat below average attempt at characterization. But, the reader only stays engaged if he or she can tolerate the intolerable minute descriptive details of material, weapons, military terms, foodstuffs, toilet paper, and more. In fact, one might think that this ""novel"" is a disguised manual for survivalists. Unfortunately, it is sold as a novel. Furthermore, Rawles' attempts to portray his militia as Christian is pathetic at best, and lacks theological foundation. For example, for a man to kill another man, for the first time, even in combat, is a soul rendering experience. For the characters in this ""novel"" it is a matter of course. Just doing the job.If the author had just told the story and left out 90% of the detailed lists the book would still be amateurish but at least entertaining."
5,Great book; great how-to-plan book!,Read it once for pure enjoyment and read it a second time with a highlighter in hand.
1,The Patriot,"I was bitterly disappointed with this book. It was more an ""infomercial"" than a novel. I guess if you are someone who is impressed with acronyms and lists of guns you might enjoy it but I could barely slog through it. I didn't even read the last chapter because I couldn't stay awake. The worst part of the whole experience is that I paid full price for it. UGGGHHI love survival novels (Alas Babylon, Day of the Triffids etc.) This book was a DRAG."
2,Fair to average,"I bought this book because I heard great things about it on the web. After reading the book in 2 days I was very unimpressed. The story was standard end of the world fare. The characters while many, were uninterestiing. I didn't care about about them or what thety were going through. Characters are introduced into the story and I thought to my self ""I wonder how many pages until this one dies."" They were that transparent.I think you might be able to find this story on some survivalist fiction web pages. I'd read the story there and not waste your money on the book.Overall poor story, poor characters, poor writing. Not impressed."
4,Interesting Read,"This book was a very good read for me. It is definitely one that will make you think want to reevaluate how prepared you are for a disaster. Because of the detail in the book, it reads more like a survival training book than a novel about survival. That is why I give it 4 stars (""I really liked it"") instead of 5 (""I loved it"")."
3,"Good, but definitely not for everyone","I've been watching SurvivalBlog for several months now and finally decided to give Patriots a read. I confess I did enjoy it, but this book is definitely not for everyone. Read the one star reviews before you buy it because their criticisms are correct.Rawles does a great blog, and is a great source of knowledge, but he's no novelist. Patriots is the most nakedly ideological novel I've ever read. Rawles is a fundamentalist libertarian Christian. You'll get strong doses of this throughout. Be prepared for it.Rawles is also as exhaustive as one can be in a novel regarding preparation for most any contingency one might encounter. His vision of the future is bleak, to say the least, which I think is far too pessimistic. He pictures the future much more violently than I do, and I certainly hope he's wrong.As a libertarian minded Christian, I enjoyed the book despite its weaknesses. But as I've said, many people have and will find this unreadable."
2,"Good idea, poorly written.","I read this book about a year ago. I thought the story subject matter was god, but Rawles is a lack luster writter. I also thought the fact that he tries to make a reference to the Keyhoe (sp?) brothers (Shane & Chevy I believe are their names) as real American heros rather pathetic. They are nothing more than racist murderers. This makes me wonder if Rawles himself adheres to their ideology. The book as a whole was not very good, but as I said the idea was good."
2,Not what I expected,"This would be interesting to middle school aged children, not a piece that looked as storylike but this was more of an entertainment piece and was sub-par at that"
3,"Good read, but too much religion.","Overall a good read. A bit too much in your face religion and conservative ideas. If your a prepper it has some good info and I did take some notes, but, might as well buy ""How to Survive the End of the World as We Know It"". I probably won't read the sequel, ""Survivors"", based on the reviews and my impression of this book. He goes into excruciating detail of preps and gear in this book, which can be useful for prepping knowledge. The characters are far fetched and overly righteous in some situations but have no problems killing and being happy about it in others. Also the preparedness of the main characters is above and beyond what the regular Joe can achieve. Overall it was entertaining and I only skipped through a handful of pages when it got boring. Not a keeper, have it re-listed for sale here on Amazon."
2,Lots of Detail and I Mean Lots and Lots and Lots....,I read the first couple chapters of Patriots and was expecting great things. The more I read the more I was bogged down in the author's details. Everything was described to the extreme that it actually made my head hurt. After reading about six chapters I couldn't take it anymore. It is apparent that the author knows his stuff in relation to this type of survivalist book but he really goes into so much detail that reading is no longer fun. Your mileage may vary. It might make for a better movie than it does a book.
4,Great read,It was a great light read with lots of practical lessons contained in the story. I'm looking forward to reading the next in the series.
5,Hard to put down,"Like the title says I had a hard time putting this book down. I really enjoyed the different scenarios. I learned from the detailed explanation of the groups preps, and my imagination had a great time with the easy to understand concepts outlined in this book. I've already lent my copy to a friend and will continue to do so."
1,Just Can't Finish It...,"Like the other reviewers, I have found the timeline really screwed up (tried to ignore that) but I just can't seem to get past the brothers who have the shoot-out in NC. While I don't believe everything my government tells me, I certainly don't condone the behavior of these 2 characters. So far there is no story development and certainly no character development. If you want to read an excellent TEOTWAWKI novel, then spend your money and time on One Second After. Patriots just seems like a ""how-to"" on breaking the law and evading capture. I have ordered Surviors and am hoping for a better reading experience but don't hold out much hope if this is typical of Rawles' writing."
2,Its alright,"Ive read much worse books, but I am not sure the author has any idea about what he was writing. There is a story in their about a survivalist group. Except for the chapters where the author rambles on about communication gear or firearms. The book goes from story to laundry list, back to story and back to laundry list. There is a couple chapter story about two brothers stuck in the middle and they are never brought back up. Its totally out of place. That being said I did make it all the way through the book, but i was listening to it on Audio Book during my commute. Also the religious piece is a bit obnoxious. I dont believe in it or hate it, but at certain points he lays it on pretty heavy. Enough that i said ""Oh My God"" several times and I wasn't praying. If you have another option, read that one and leave this till you've read the second to last book after the apocalypse."
4,A Worthwhile Read,"I came upon this book after searching for post-apocalyptic literature on the internet. After reading a few reviews, I decided to purchase it on Kindle. The book has a good storyline with practical information thrown in along the way. Some of the character emotions needed a bit of development(i.e. close friends die and life carries on). Rawles' beliefs certainly come through in the book, but as an author it is his right to express those beliefs (and I have to say I disagree with only a few of them). My only other issue is that the book could have used a second edit/read-through.In all, a captivating read that draws attention to the looming economic crisis that is likely to hit within the next decade.Needless to say, I am now an avid survivalblog.com (Rawles' preparedness blog) reader after finishing the book."
1,right wing crazies rejoice!,"If you're looking for speculative fiction regarding a societal collapse, you may have stumbled onto this book. If you're expecting a story of humanity overcoming obstacles, character development, etc. -- pass on this one. If you're expecting a barely veiled political rant centered on gun control and a deep seated hate for modern society, you've struck gold. If I could undo my order of this book, I would. After getting about halfway through the book, I started wondering if the FBI had started watching me and whether or not ATF ""thugs"" would be breaking down my door to shoot me down in cold blood. There are some very good practical suggestions in this book, and I appreciate it's relatively (for the genre) realistic ramp-up to the collapse... but this novel is soaked in so much random right wing radical rhetoric -- that a lot of the potential is lost."
5,Get it now,probably the most useful novel of our decade if our own govt. wants to block it its probably great. buy it!
4,Whoa...,"I must admit: I have not been able to get much beyond the first 100 pages, yet. I thought I was somewhat ""ready"" psychologically & emotionally, but this book proved to me that I'm not...just within the first few pages.That said, it's been an excellent eye-opener so far. It's well written and engaging. I would highly recommend it to someone if only so that he/she could get a feel for all of the variables the U.S. is endangered by today. It's also been a great source for showing me how far removed almost ALL of us are from 1) basic Boy-Scout knowledge on surviving; 2) basic economic education; and 3) basic civics education.The only reason I give it 4 out of 5 is that I have not finished it, yet. It's not that expensive and could turn out to be a great addition to your reading list."
1,Yummmy Religious Gun Pornography,"This book is nothing but pornography for religious zealots that enjoy masturbating to Soldier of Fortune magazine while pretending they are not a racist because you have a ""Black Friend"". I would actually recommend hitting yourself in the head with a hammer before reading this book. It's offensive to anyone that is a Survival Minded gun owner. If any sane person out there reads this book please don't let it be the basis of your opinion for Survival Minded persons.After reading this book (and boy was it hard) I envision Mr Rowels as the con-man that was selling survival retreats in the 80's movie ""Survivors"" to the weak minded and/or extremists. Please save your money....I would be happy to give you my copy."
4,Great Book with some questionable editing,"The information and ideas contained in the book are fantastic. The author clearly is an expert in survival and preparations, however there are some definite editing issues. There are many instances where the years given make no sense. They seem to jump around. Despite these inconsistencies, it is an enjoyable read if preparing for a disaster or other situation is something you are interested in. It is an educational read that also entertains."
4,Unthought of water means,The ideas in this book are very simple yet effective means for purification of water. It was good to learn that it's not just a mater of boiling the water and what the different types of contamination are. The materials needed to exercise these methods are common and simple enough to understand that they are useful and effective ways to provide the water needed in most circumstances. I found the book informative and well worth reading.
3,Well.....,"...as a novel this books pretty awful. None of the characters are really distinguishable from each other, and all the dialogue sounds like the dude plagiarized an army field manual. The author's brave militia ends up fighting a whole host of right wing boogiemen, including commie cannibals (really).So that sums up the bad. The author is a great researcher, and the books full of interesting information. It's worth a read."
4,If you think you're ready....you're not!,"This ""novel"" has tons of great information on different ways to prepare to survive the economic collapse that we are starting now! The fiction (not really) makes the learning interesting and shows the practicality. It is a great primer on the preperations and provides background for survivalblog dot com. Buy a few copies you will want to give them to the people you care about!"
3,Tedious.,Good story line.......but OMG was it tedious!!!! This guy MUST be getting paid by the word & needs the extra $$$$. The detailed minutae put me to sleep on numerous occasions.
2,Waste of Time,"Poorly written. Very little character development, with not much for story. A few moments of fireworks drama here and there. It seems the only thing he got right was all the firearms brands names and the tactical planning. Almost everything else was skipped over or he messed up the details."
1,just plain bad,"The writing is at about high school level. At best it compares to some of the cheap Executioner knock-offs of the 70's. While Mr. Rawles' ideas are well thought out, his fiction writing skills are poor. Save your money!"
2,Not great but not horrible either,"I saw this at B&N and picked it up, it flows along the lines of so many other books in this genere, only Bible reading folk will survive, I was a little disappointed at that. It also presents what I would consider the best case in being prepared, not likely for the majority of people. The way the author presented the tactical living and preperation was good though. Overall the story flowed ok and it did keep my interest but not a ""how to"" book."
5,Good book,"One can learn a lot about how to prepare for emergency situations, natural disasters, etc from reading this book. Opens the mind to think out of the box and determine what is important for each individual circumstance. Not an easy read like a storybook but definitely packed with good information,"
3,different,"This book was confusing in many ways. I think he wanted to write it as a novel but didn't really develop any of the characters enough that you cared what happened to them. There was useful information in this book but digging through the fiction at the same time kind of made me wonder if there wasn't a better way to present the info. For instance they talked about canning and making jerky, etc but no real details on doing that. I think the ideas he presented need to be talked about. This is also somewhat ""if you could afford all this you need it."" Kind of a rich mans guide to survival."
4,"Exciting story, great for the closet survivalist...","...but way over the top. Full of extremely interesting 'how to' information, indespensible if you secretly yearn for that log cabin in the mountains, but are you seriously going to stock up for world war III? And does it matter whether you are shot with a specially coated left hand drive auto coffee making multi shot short barreled belt fed pistol with radar-laser-magnetic sights or a cheap and nasty, bought it from a discount store, special? But if specifications are your thing then this is the book for you, right down to the serial numbers.One aspect I found particularly tedious was the notion that the UN is the evil empire. Oh come on. Really.Having said that, I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book; when the daily 9 to 5 is especially tedious, I fancy dropping everything for a cabin in the north. Who doesn't?"
2,Agenda driven book,"Religous and political agenda at play in my opinion. The book seems to start with a plausible scenario, but quickly plays out in what I feel to be a very unrealistic one. Anyway, I just didnt like it. Personal opinion. If your looking for something in this genre, try ""One Second After""."
4,Good Book Too Much religion,This is a good entertaining book but Rawles pushes religion way too much and his knowledge of firearms is not up to par.
1,disappointed - needs update to digital friendly,"Okay, I don't mind buying a CD rather than a digital download, but the least I expect is that the CD's will easily load and file into my iTunes. Who plays CD's anymore? Most of us want to place this on a digital player. Not that iTunes doesn't easily see or upload the files, but the producer of this CD has named the files on each of the discs the same code, so when you go to upload you spend hours renaming and filing so they will play in the right order. Each 30 to 40 seconds it is a new track with a repeated code so there are 99 on each CD. It is certainly not worth my time to upload the numerous tracks and do the renaming/filing so I can play it via my iPhone. They need to move into the current times! What a disappointment. As far as content, can't comment."
2,Mislabeled!,"This is NOT a novel - it reads more like a camping and gun catalog! Every item is described by make and model number, where it came from, etc., whereas the people are two-dimensional. Maybe a good book if you are planning to hide out in a fortress in the wilds, but not useful for the average person."
1,patriot,"I could not finish the book, it is like reading a shopping list with places and companies who make different products.Not a novel, more like a how to in a specific circumstance.I gave this a 1 star but that is generous"
3,"Great as a handbook, horrible as a novel","Sorry for my English, I'm not a native speaker.It'ss a very different way of present a handbook. Probably if you see that way is a great book. You will understand why things happens, how to do things and what to do if you want some things.If you buy as a novel probably you will not like it. Everybody in the novel is more or less equaly heroic, all of them are the same strengh, they have different skills but always complimentary.Everything happens when they need -the good guys, I mean-and always good guys always win. Well, sometimes they don't, but it was needed as a -lets say- dramatic resource.Anyway, a good way of starting your preparedness library.Note: I won't ruine the story, but at some point there are two communists. Our heroes find in their backpacks kid legs and arms ready to eat *and* several Mao Tse Tung's Red Books. The old stereotypical kid-eater communists revisited. So funny. Sometimes it's that kind of novel, you're warned."
2,Hopeful - But Disappointed,"I had high hopes for this book based on reviews. However, after only 1/4 the way through, I am done. My gripe is that the author seemed conflicted between writing a novel and a non-fiction book. Thus, the inordinate amount of detail regarding how the characters prepped gets in the way of telling a good story. Above all - a novel should tell a GOOD STORY. It is as if it was written by someone with autism or other disorder that disconnects them from the details of human interaction. The mood of the story is flat, as if I was reading a technical manual."
4,Overall a great LCD Mount,Pros: Easy to install. Does exactly what it should. As long as the cables are not too stiff the cable routing works well. Tension is adjustable with included Allen wrenches.Cons: There are some small screws on the cable covers. I lost one in our carpet.Overall: Great product at this price. Just be careful with the little screws if you take them out.
1,overpriced junk,What a disappointment! The idea is great but the execution is awful. The clip is so weak it doesn't hold any paper whatsoever. The clock does not hold correct time. To charge $20 for this piece of junk is a joke (on the buyer!)
3,space mission analysis and design,"The third edition falls short of the information provided in the second edition. The third edition lacks the detail on thermal radiation and conditions that was included in the second edition . ( see chapter 11.5). It appears to me that the 3rd edition is more a generalization and discussion, rather than providing a detail method of analysis for a space mission. If possible , I would like to return my copy of the 3rd edition for a copy of the second edition. Thank you. L. Rosenman"
4,Not accurate at all,"Basically it works, however, it's not very useful, b/c it's not accurate at all! I use it to detect the wall with moisture in my basement, got nothing (means dry, <10%), but the inspector detected it 20-30% (don't know which moisture meter he used). And also I put two legs into water directly, only got 25%-28%, which is not true, it should be >>28%, I would not recommend it for any serious use."
5,A thriller,Ambassador Diego Asencio bravely reconstructs his 61 days of captivity in Bogota. The siege takes place at the Dominican Republic Embassy and is carried out by Colombia's revolutionary M19 guerrilla organization. This book is a rare look at how the captive diplomats played a large role in securing freedom. It is also testimony that the honest practice of conflict resolution can bring positive results. It is a small miracle that only one person died during this epic takeover. Much credit must be given to the diplomats in capitivity. Ambassador Asencio is a polished writer and does an outstanding job of objectively describing the highs and lows of his days in captivity.
4,the frame of the film was pretty cool,"I loved this film. Twist was surprisingly unexpected, the picture itself was very formalist. Narrative was not strait and step by step. It starts with the same scene as it ends. Besides, this film has implicit causality which becomes explicit in the end. Has some associational editing (the scene where Rourke's character talks about the errection in his encounter with one hooker who was "" warm and sticky like a honey dew"". I think , this film is quite artistic ( although, not as much as Un Chien Andalou ). I love the music here by Michael Lorenz. And if you like Polish films or if you appriciate formalist films over the box-office Hollywood flicks, you definitely need to see Exit in Red."
1,Save your money,"Perhaps the author was writing for his ""peers"", but this book will in no way connect with the reader who is spending his/her hard-earned money looking to find out more about gematria. It's overly specialised, but more often non-sensical. Also Hebrew and Greek gematria do not mix, and to ""purists"", Greek gematria is irrelevant."
4,Killer punk box,"I have to agree with MastaV here. This box is not perfect, but it has a lot to offer. It has 120 tracks of punk rock. I got mine for $15, so when I do the math... I get real happy. Don't like some of the cuts? Skip 'em! This is like getting a whole crate of records from a bad roommate who skips town: you may not agree with everything, but the price is right, you know? It's a pretty wide mix: tunes from the Sex Pistols (not NMTB), Dead Kennedys (live), but also Eater, The Damned, Au Pairs, Stooges, Chelsea, Lurkers, uh Theatre of Hate, NMA, The Fall. So, it's a lot of punk, but also some post-punk and just a smidgen of non-punk. Put it in you Ipod and rock out if you can still find it!"
5,First literary Wobegon experience of a Prairie Home fan.,Humor braided with history and truth gives a masterfully mixed cocktail of Northern Plains living. Keilor uses meticulous detail to take you to Lake Wobegon. Tomato fights to funerals provide windows to Minnesota life as a young boy (Keillor) grows up. Heritage and Norse history are compounded into a small town to pull a smile out of even the staunchest of people. Very enjoyable for anyone with the slightest liking to lutefisk or pickled herring. Very enjoyable.
1,A painful read.,I've read other books by Garrison Keillor and was excited to read this one. I was very dissapointed in this book. I had to force myself to finish.
1,Not Designed for the Human Hand,"This mouse only works if you have tiny hands and keep three fingers on the each the left, middle, and right mouse buttons. If you typically grip your mouse between your thumb and ring finger and click with your pointer and middle fingers, you will find this mouse uncomfortable. It also won't support your palm or allow you to hold your wrist at a comfortable angle."
5,Excellent tool; very handy for a woman!,"The Pulse is an awesome tool, for a man OR for a woman. I use mine almost daily -- whether I need a knife to cut something, or some scissors when I'm away from home, or a screwdriver, it's all right there. I can't speak for the advantages/disadvantages for getting a Pulse vs. another Leatherman product, but I can say that this tool has been incredibly helpful to me, and is easy to use. The only difficult part is that the locking/unlocking mechanism is a little difficult at times, but I'd much prefer that to it not working correctly.And, uh, watch out -- the knife blade is very sharp!!!"
4,Music Fan,"This mix cd is a must for your party. I use this one and the Line Dance 2000 cd....who needs a dj. Cochise does it all for you. ""Strictly for the House Party"" also has all the radio versions...so you can play it any where."
1,Tedious,I agree with the other reviewers who thought this book was awful. I have read almost all of her books and really wanted something as good as her books normally are. The description of the story is misleading. i thought it was a vampire book. When I realized it was an alien book I was sorely disappointed. The story is tedious. And Kara is just so stupid. I know I'm being hunted lets go back home and have my lover save me so he can get captured and tormented. I couldn't even finish the book. It gave me some weird not so pleasant alien dreams.
4,"Something different, I liked it!","Okay so maybe this wasn't your usual vampire story, but I really enjoyed it just the same. Maybe because it combined two of my favorite kinds of stories, vampire and futuristic. So maybe Alex wasn't a ""real"" vampire, he sure shared a lot of the characteristics and as was hinted in the book, where did vampires come from originally anyway. Maybe from another planet??? It was a fun read anyway and a nice romance between Alex and Kara. Don't let all the bad reviews keep you from reading this one."
2,Somewhat dated,"Purchased this 2 years ago. The support crew at the time said a new version was ""on the doorstep"" but nothing on that since then. This program is pretty dated. It has some nice features, but really lacks the pieces that would make it much better than the word processors that just about everyone now has already. In particular, the program does not have any tools that track story timelines (promised in new version). The tools that it does have - like outlining and areas to store character data - can be fairly easily reproduced using features in standard word processors like Microsoft Word. I can not recommend the product in it's current version. Maybe if that new version would ever materialize..."
4,Great software and fun too!,"I ABSOLUTELY love this software, and while others are close to it, this one is far more superior. It has alot of different functions and makes writing notes easy, checking off plot points easy, and organizing extremely easy. If you are unorganized, this is perfect for you! The only problems I've faced are little glitches and bugs in the software here and there, but whenever I email, they do get to them and fix them. Because of this, it's important to get the new updates off the web whenever you get the chance. I do wish they had a troubleshooting section also, but overall this is a great program!! I would highly recommend it for both beginners and more advanced writers like myself. Just remember to go through the tutorials before you use it or it tends to get a bit frustrating."
5,Small but effective smart charger,"This unit is easy to store, but has sufficient capacity to be effective.Be aware that the uit can get quite warm.I like the fact that you can permanently attach charger cables to the battery. For the RV and riding lawn mower, it makes sense."
4,Great Charger,"This charger realy can bring back a weak battery,and is a great trickle charger to maintain a battery in storage. However if your battery is completly dead your going to need a standard type that can provide 10 Amps or more before this charger can take over and revive it."
1,Endlessly Expensive,"I bought this light for an office without windows and liked it for a small plant. But, when the light bulb burned out in about a month I found that there is no generic replacement bulb and their replacement bulb is $12.95. You can only find the bulbs online so you have to factor in shipping, too. Do the math. You will spend enough in one year for replacement bulbs to make buying fresh flowers from the grocery store more convenient. I am junking it and getting out while I can. Expensive lesson in checking out replacement parts before buying something."
4,grow light,"this grow light is great. set on a timer for different seasons and works great. I don't have to think about it. It even has a watering notification, which is a good reminder. It is small but good for little starters. I have been totally please with this product."
1,Wears out too fast,"I am on the second one of these. Bulb stops working after 3-4 months. Bought another bulb online, still didn't work. Same situation after 8 months with second unit. Bulb stops working... replacement doesn't work. Waste of good money. i will not buy another."
1,Terrible product,"Light died after about 2 months. I smelled a burning smell upstairs and came down to my entire first floor smelling like burnt rubber. Worked just ok for the two months it functioned. The ""water me"" feature never worked. I would not recommend this product to anyone."
1,Reasonable lamp but no replacement bulbs,"Do not buy this lamp - bulbs are nigh impossible to find. The bulb lasted about 3 weeks for me and now can't find a replacement anywhere - not on Amazon, local hardware, local electrical store nor major DIY outlets. So its $$$ down the drain for the entire lamp."
4,"Spend a little more for the 50""...","I am a big fan of these Clamp'N'Tool guides. I mainly use mine as a straight edge tool guide and I have found that it performs well for this purpose. Clamping it square to the workpiece takes a bit of fussing, but once it is square and locked down there are no worries of slippage or flexing, even under significant pressure. Using a handheld circular saw or router riding against this tool guide, I get an arrow straight cut every time. Although there are some situations where this 36"" guide would come in handy, I recommend spending the extra five bucks to get the 50"" tool so you have the capability to cross cut plywood (believe me you will use it if you have it).I would feel better about the value of this tool if it cost a bit less, but it does provide you with increased cutting options for a lot less than a big table saw and/or outfeed table would cost."
3,updated to include the internet,"This book is little changed since edition 5. There were some minor updates to case example to correct ""dated"" material. There are now references to internet marketing and drug marketing. This book is not worth the addtional cost over edition 5. The CDROM is a nice touch for those who like a multimedia experience."
1,junk,shows gold ends came with silver ends for a less quality connection which is free at time warner . false advertising
3,Disappointing edition,"I have several editions of The Wind in the Willows, and I bought this edition because I specifically wanted one illustrated by Paul Bransom. Imagine my disappointment when I received it and discovered that the only illustration was that on the cover. Perhaps the description needs to be revamped."
2,That's it??? That's the end???,"This book managed to keep my attention at the beginning. After Marcel and Ian spent their time together, the author made a huge mistake with the details of the story, which just ruined the book for me. I just lost interest. I didn't feel that she concluded the storyline of the attempted buyout of Marcel's magazine. Will there be a sequel? Just too many loose ends."
4,Nice Kit for the Money,"This is a great starter kit. The only thing that it really needs right off, being a trauma bag is a blood stopper product. I will of course be adding several other items to fit my families needs as well. The bag is of good quality and appears to be without any defects. All materials are in great condition and of good quality."
5,Great product!,Really good product! Only missing a few key items needed but over all it has all you'll really need.
5,"I don't need a whole line...just one word ""exquisite""",This CD will help peace reign in your heart. Its wonderful combination of soft music and nature sounds calms even the most stressed person after a long hard day.
4,Exactly Like Project Runway But for Interior Design,"If I were not doing a makeover currently of our condo I might find this not that interesting. However, the show has given me lots of interesting ideas, including materials which I never even thought of using before. One interesting twist this show has that Project Runway does not is that the end goal is to become a tv interior designer, that is to do tv shows about this topic for HGTV, not to become interior designers. So these contestants have to do actual videos taking the viewer through their ""houses"" as part of the competition. When I am done redoing our unit, I probably will completely lose interest in this topic. However, if you too have gotten interior design bug for awhile, you probably will enjoy this show."
2,"uh, i really like ""flavor of the month""","hm, well i heard soooo much word of mouth about the posies, described using phrases like ""pop-tinged"" etc but i have yet to warm up to it much. i like one song (flavor of the month) and thats probably all of it ill listen to. how to describe : well its ""harder"" than buffalo tom and ""lighter"" than sponge, and less catchy than both. if you want, you can buy my copy for $5."
2,"Mediocre, unmemorable","After the great Dear 23 album, Frosting is downright disappointing. All of the songs sound about the same, and there is nothing that really stands out or sticks in your head. ""Flavor of the Month"" is OK, but beyond that, this is just so much revved-up guitars going nowhere."
3,Basic,"Does collect hangers decently although the hangers can slip off the bottom if not lifted carefully. Made of the same plastic material as regular plastic hangers. It arrives unassembled - tabs that interlock. Mine came with one tab broken, but I glued it myself. Holds approximately 20-25 plastic hangers. A little small & flimsy for the money, but it works."
3,You Get What You Pay For,We got ours for $4.99 at Bed Bath & Beyond. It's not terribly sturdy; if you treat it right it will do a good job of organizing those plastic hangers that seem to multiply like rabbits.A word of warning. The image of the hanger caddy on the outside of the Bed Bath & Beyond package was drawn such that it appears the hangers should stand upright inside the caddy instead of laying down flat outside of the four upright posts. This caused some confusion and we were about to return the item to the seller when we came across photos of similar caddies on the net (like the one here on Amazon.com) and all was revealed.
3,"Boring in places, but Tim Roth is hysterical as the bellboy","I thought this movie was pretty boring and frustrating in places as it didn't really seem to be going anywhere, but tim roth as ted the english bellboy was well cast and a hysterical character. The first room (Allison Anders) was by far the worst but was made up for by Tarantino, Rodriguez and Rockwell's rooms. Funny and witty scripts should be acknowledged instead of just writing off the whole film."
2,Not funny,"This weird movie tries hard for a kind of quirky (and obscene) humor, but it merely succeeds in being bizarre. An idiotic bell boy goes to four different rooms during the course of New Year's Eve and gets involved in four different, rather miserable situations (though those who are fond of bare breasts will enjoy the first act, in which a coven of witches seduces the bellboy.) The acting is mannerist and rather poor, and I can't say much else for this movie except that I'm sorry I wasted the time seeing it."
3,"uhh, my brother liked it","I didnt like this movie because it had people with a lot of hair. whats with all that hair. my brother Cleetus liked it when that thing happened, and then the other thing right after it. i have to admit, i liked that part too. the best part was when the guy went into the buiding and was talking to the other guy for a while and then left. that was crazy. you might not like this movie... but if you like things that happen and people that talk to other people, you may very well like this movie. on a scale of 1-10 i definatly give this movie somewhere between 1 and 10"
2,Four Rooms,"Shipping was a little much for a slow service, but everything was received by Christmas. Unfortunately this is a terrible movie. Unless you are a die hard Quentin fan, do not buy it.Rob"
2,this is only so-so,"Fast-forward to story #3, the one directed by Robert Rodriguez (no wonder). This is by far the best story of the group. The kids are terrific actors; the absurdity of the final scenes is not to be missed. The final story is in a distant second place for me. The other two vignettes are awful, especially the first one. I agree with the person who said it's just an excuse to have a few beautiful actresses show their naked breasts. Tim Roth makes a bad imitation of PeeWee Herman throughout the movie, but his antics are more moderate in the last two stories."
2,Haven't these folks anything better to do?,"Although this assemblage of vignettes was written and directed by four sets of folks, and features four sets of actors, it's uniformly unfunny throughout. Everybody overacts like crazy -- I assume because they realize the material needs as much pumping up as it can get. The most intriguing feature is Tim Roth's hypertwitchiness as he responds to each cue tossed at him with about six takes in rapid-fire succession."
3,Think twice,"If you really are going to invest in a night vision scope, you may as well go with a more expensive model. For what it's worth, the Explorer is sufficient, but the infared light to see in darkness is quite annoying. The manual focus can be a hassle as well. This device is excellent- almost four stars- but if you are going to spend the money, you may as well do it right."
4,Ayurvedic cooking for self healing,I found the book to be very helpful in understanding the different type of spices and oils. After obtaining the spices it was easy to make the recipes. Each recipe was labeled to let you know which dosha type the recipe would help. This is a good book for those of us who are just learning.Marilyn
5,Easily accessble to the novice,"This is the first book I bought for Ayurvedic cooking and it has inspired a host of new dishes in my family. Through this book, I have discovered that Ayurvedic cooking is EASY and simple. (Not to mention cheap and healthy). Of course, I haven't endeavored to create some of the more complicated dishes, but I love the standard fare. It's has been a great investment to my cooking library."
5,hands down best Ayurvedic cookbook!,"I love this cookbook! The instructions are specific and simple. Out of all my Ayurvedic cookbooks, I use this one the most. I've made almost every recipe in the book. Dr. and Mrs. Lad are living examples of the benefits of the Ayurvedic life style."
5,Excellent cookbook for healthy eating!,"Recommended by my Yoga and Ayurvedic teacher, this cookbook has all the guidelines you need for healthy eating. You can combine this kind of diet with your favorite foods, including meat, fish and poultry if you are not vegetarian, and still reap many benefits."
5,Great vibrational sound for healing,Wonderful relaxing meditation music. Use it in my massage business and have had wonderful comments on its relaxational benefits. Great for personal use and stress relief.
1,Useless product,"I do not know if the binoculars I received were faulty, but this Russian made product has such poor performance that it doesn't serve any purpose. These binoculars cannot be properly focussed and the clarity is nonexistant."
3,Poor image capture speed,"This camera is kind of neat since it can record both video and still pictures. However, I found that whenever I take still pictures if the subject is moving or I am moving even a little bit the image is blurred. In order to get a good image you must hold the camera steady for at least 3-5 seconds after taking the picture. So, If I had the option I would save my money and wait for about six months. There is bound to be something better right around the corner."
3,Questionable quality,"I wanted a digital camera that was under $150. I decided to buy the Agfa CL-18. I have since noticed that there are little spots in my pictures that are some kind of defect. Cleaning the lens does nothing to remove them. Another thing I noticed is that when taking pictures indoors sometimes the colors are not accurate. You also have to be careful when using the flash indoors because it is very easy to under or overexpose. There is also a large lag in between taking pictures that could bother someone who wants to take several pictures in a roll. However, the software is very easy to use, and the camera is very small and does not take too much battery power. Buy this if you want to take small, informal pictures for email and small pictures, or if you want a child or teenager to have something to play with. But if you have any desire to take a high-quality picture, and want to edit it, then use your film camera and a scanner."
3,It's ok. I guess you get what you pay for,I have learned that it seems that this camera takes better pictures when in broad daylight. I've taken pictures in the house and the pictures come out very dark. I'm still trying to get used to not moving the camera so much after shooting.
3,"Easy to use, good entry level camera","... The pircture quality turned out pretty nice and clear, you just have to keep your hands still for 5-10 seconds after pushing the button(it takes even longer if using flash). But overall it was not as awful as some other reviewers described. Holds up to 32 pix and you can review them on television. Small, elegant, user friendly. This camera is good for taking still images for your websites or for personal fun. ...END"
3,"Good Pix, but no Mac support","I bought one to experiment with digital photography. It takses very good pictures, and I was able to get good results under a variety of conditions using supplementary 3rd-party lenses.But I have a Macintosh, so I have to use a friend's PC to download the pictures. It seems that, since Mac has USB as a standard interface, these fine folks ought to support Mac AT LEAST to the extent of transferring the pictures to the Mac's hard drive in some format the camera already supports.How about placing a driver download on your website, AGFA?!"
1,Induced Vomiting,"I've had low-cal diet proteins/shakes before and they never taste great, but this was absolutely disgusting. I actually had to stop half-way through my first shake because I started to vomit. I hate wasting something I paid for so I continued to take it and I've gotten past my initial vomit reflex so I can actually drink an entire shake now.But this is by far the worst-tasting thing I've ever consumed, ever, and I think less of Optimum Nutrition for putting out such a disgusting product. I strongly discourage you from buying this."
2,"Great ingredients, but can't stand the after taste.","I've been wanting to eat healthier, and figured using a protein shake to replace 1-2 meals a day, would be a good start. So I bought ON Complete Protein Diet, and the Pro Complex (both in chocolate). OMG are the tastes night and day. The Complete Protein Diet has a fairly good taste when you first take a sip, but holy jeebus, the aftertaste. I have no idea how to describe it, besides it tasting like chemicals and cheap flavoring. Plastic-y like taste, that I have to make myself swallow.It also has a pudding like texture, except it's still kind of gritty. I was very disappointed in it. It has absolutely wonderful nutrients, and the kind of proteins I was looking for. But the cons outway the pros.Take a look at the Pro Complex (not the natural, no idea about it's taste). It has a wonderfully smooth texture, and the taste is very nice. The aftertaste is almost cinnamon, but not quite. Delicious though!"
2,Too thin,"Expected more, for such a juicy subject. Either its quite an oldie or it's just too plain. No photos only sketches, not too inspirational."
5,Best you can get,"Great product, and it's the best you'll find for Generation 1 night optics. Unless you want to go spending $1,000-4,000 for Generation 2 or 3 night optics, this is a good buy, and in a decent price range. It does what it advertises, and that's the important part."
3,Fair quality for the price.,This unit works well with a low amount of light. I would suggest to someone buying this unit to also buy a infared flashlight to compliment it.
1,This thing is junk,"After I got stranded in Minnesota (im from WI) and a passerby had one of these jump kits I thought I should get one for emergencies. Charged the pack according to the directions. Wish I would have gotten a different one, this thing is junk, wont start my car or snowmobile the compressor is loud and I havent used it but guessing it wont work well. Even with the charge past 100% it still doesnt work and there is no on off switch either. this thing is useless DO NOT buy this thing"
2,I don't know if really work.,I install the ionizer but I didn't feel any difference. About a month of stay connected began to make a strange sound and next couple of days it turned off forever...
1,It quit working after a one month,"Kaboosh, no turn on after one month. What's up with that?They have worked in the past, poor QC or somehthing."
2,Pro Cabinetmaker weighs in,"Save your money and buy some nice cobalt or titanium nitride bits. These bits do blowout in most veneered materials and are useless in all MDF products. They clog almost immediately. I had high hopes for these when I bought them three years ago, but since I paid so much for them I can't bring myself to just throw them away. The best feature is that they do center very well when started. After that, expect problems."
3,Back Cover Description,"Bob Sutton twisted his body painfully, seeking shelter from the killing desert sun. Two men had just ambushed him and shot his horse. He shook his bloodied head trying to make sense of it all. Why would anyone want to harm him? He had no enemies. He was simply heading for Whiskey Creek, after a five-year absense, to visit his ailing father."
5,Excelente para disfrutar una copa de vino en buen acompañía,"Es una excelente pieza para disfrutar una velada agradable en buena compañía. Incluso para escuchar el el auto cuando se va en un viaje largo. Eso sí, para cantarla en alto.La recomiendo para todo aquel que aprecie el romanticismo, aún si no se es romántico."
3,OK for a mix collection...,"If you are looking for a full-length album, this is not for you. But if you are looking for a demonstration of DB's versatility in being able to take one song and remake it reflecting what is/was current in several contemporary genres this will be a treat."
4,Great summary of history and river uses.,Really enjoyed reading the numerous stories of Columbia River history and the competing uses of the river. Towards the end the author gets a little too dramatic about wild salmon and native Americans and seems to lose the balanced views presented thoughout most of the book.
4,A Rose by Another Name,"Reading biographies in general can be a tricky thing, they can be either too textbook and boring, or they can be very enjoyable. I must say that the latter is true for this book.Carolly Erickson draws the reader into the life and very turbulent times of the French Revolution. It is amazing that Josephine became the Empress of France.Josephine Bonaparte was a true surviver for her time, even growing up on a failing sugar cane farm on Martinique and later in France as a prisoner. Unlike many biographies that I have read, this one reads easy. What I mean there is a fluid way in which Erickson writes, drawing in the reader like any good fiction novelist. I quickly read this book, devouring every page."
1,I found this book empty and without interest.,"I found this book empty. There is nothing new. The author does not appear to have an in-depth knowledge of the characters and circumstances she describes. The description of landscapes, gardens, cities, in France as well as in Italy, shows that the author borrowed her ideas from works from previous authors. Please read the book ""Josephine"" written by Andre Castelot and compare!"
4,"Happy Couples...You, too, Should Read This","This book uses some pretty dated references but the core information is excellent. I am about halfway through and find that the insight is (obviously) applicable to your partnership but I think it could also provide insight into other close relationships-- particularly the idea of ""banking"".I also think that if you are struggling with a partner who isn't exactly meeting you half-way with relationship improvement attempts, you can still benefit from being the sole reader of the book.A side note: This book is hetero-centric, meaning all the couples used as models are male/female. That being said, the information is excellent and the lack of same-sex modeling (while failing to holistically represent all couplings) does not necessarily negate the value of the information. I would recommend this book to same-sex partners."
4,"We Can Work It Out: How to solve conflicts, Save Your Marriage",It was a little slow at the beginning but picked up. I must say it is a good book and worth the money.
2,The Only Positive About This Movie,"As a whole, this movie was so yesterday's way of ""Bring It On."" No good story line. Just another thrown together spare in movieland. The only positive was Bree Turner as Tina Hammersmith. Hollywood needs to get her promoted as a Lead Villain for future motion pictures. Her dark side of Tina Hammersmith showed just that."
3,Not that bad.....,"I don't think that this was that bad of a movie at all, although reading the reviews you would think otherwise. Buy it used off someone and it's worth the watch."
3,Good cheerleading/bad movie,"If this movie didn't try to have a plot, it would be great. The scenes where there is no cheerleading action are just kind of painful to watch. Not much of what happens is plausible, and what is plausible is entirely too predictable. The cheerleading routines are fun to watch thought they're not as good as in the first movie, and the ending stinks. Even so, I liked the movie and will watch it again."
1,It Sucked,"The movie only had one competition, and when they one that competition you expected to see them go to the cmopetition and watch all sort of team try to win the nationals. But no, you see them one and then it's the end. It sucked royally. I'd never watch it again. The first movie ""Bring it on"" rocked and had the expectations of a cheerleading try out and all. They should of just left the first one be and create another similar movie, like a sequal to that one. Like of what happens to that group when they when they went to college or something."
3,I was pleasantly surprised,I thought this was going to suck but it was fairly good. It had it's funny moments and it stood on its own without trying to imitate or try to have the same plot as the original. It was a watchable B movie and I'd recomend it.
2,it's that bad,"Well... I thought it sounded bad from when I heard there was a sequel to the original Bring it On, but wow, this is bad. I won't talk about the bad acting because, lets be honest, the acting in the first one wasn't that great. So lets get right to the reason we watch the movie at all... the cheerleading. While the routines in the first movie were great and showcased some great talent and kick [butt] music... this version doesn't come close to that level. There is a reason this went directly to video... and it really shouldn't have ever existed."
1,junk electronics,"Eighteen months ago, I bought the predecessor, MP730, and my wife and I have used it only occasionally in a home office. Recently it began to generate error messages and thereafter ceased to function at all. I've spoken with Canon and independent repair shops; it appears that the microprocessor ""just went bad"".I wouldn't buy another Canon printer because this one lasted through only 18 months' of occasional use. Even in an age of disposable electronics, that seems a bit thin."
3,Won't Print Black,"We've had our Canon PIXMA 780 for about a year and a half and it, too, will no longer print black no matter how many times we deep-cleaned it as instructed. The User Manual and Software guides are not user friendly or helpful and their troubleshooting is limited. We could only determine what our problem was thru internet research and found out our problem is very common with this printer. It uses color ink quickly and we replace cartridges often. If repairs are too costly, we will buy a different printer. Cannot recommend this printer, although like others, we used Consumer Reports to research it and thought we had made a good choice."
2,"In less than a year, not funcitoning consistently","I'm disappointed with the reliability of the MX870. After less than a year of very moderate use, I get an error often when I print. It's a cartridge read error. I did call support, and it worked temporarily, but now that the warrantee is up, I stuck with the issue.I'm looking for a reliable all-in-one for very moderate use. Spare me the bells and whistles and just give me something that won't break after minimal use."
2,Warming Up Issues,"The printer function works just fine. It's the copy and fax where the problem lies. If the printer hasn't been used for awhile and you select copy or fax you get a warming up message. Then you get to wait and wait and wait and wait. If you turn it off and then back on you can proceed. Canon customer service has been fairly helpful, but no resolution other than sending me another printer that has the same problem."
4,It IS all-in-one,"All-in-ones always sacrifice something in contrast to printers dedicated to a single purpose, and this is no exception. But among all-in-ones, it rates high marks for photo printing. This printer is large, bulky, and not as intutive as HP printers BUT it performs all tasks far better than most."
3,Good but not so good,"This is an awkward machine.First the good stuff; very good quality prints * Manual fax - when you pick up the phone and hear fax tone just push the fax button and hang up. Paper tray and back feed.Now the bad stuff; very heavy and bulky * top lid very heavy on its own and slams on the unit when closing, have to be careful * have the unit has to be opened in order to put ink cartridges in. it's way inside the unit. * Terrible manual * terrible menu on the unit * no menu software.For $200 it's okay. If weight and ease of use is a consideration, check other brands."
1,Don't buy this if you use a MAC,"I purchased this printer because of its compatibility with the Mac OS. Don't make the same mistake as I did - if you are planning on printing wirelessly through the airport extreme base (which I wanted to do), airport does NOT recognize this printer and it won't work through the base. An expensive mistake for me as I am now saddled with a unusable brand new printer."
4,Excellent Home Office Machine,"I love the Canon. Easy to set up, great to look at, small foot print, excellent quality faxing, copying and printing. On top of the that the Amazon price was the best on-line price."
4,all that you need,"bought this a couple years ago and have had absolutely no issues with it (famous last words). the only negative is the size - it is quite large, otherwise it would be 5 stars."
3,"Great print quality, but FADES FAST.","I have used this printer for about 9 months and recently noticed that a bunch of prints I made on the Canon photo paper have faded. These prints were definitely not in the sun, but yes, exposed to some daylight. I'm disappointed to say the least and now I have to buy another printer in order to use the new longer lasting inks????Also, when I upgraded my system software (OSX10.4.9), the scanner ceased to function and after attempting the fix that Canon suggested TWICE and still NOT being able to use the scanner, Canon customer support chose to ignore my pleas for help.So, I have a moderately expensive multifunction that makes color prints that fade and that has a scanner that does not work.Thanks Canon."
1,A great printer with a Dead End.,"I purchased this printer a few years ago, mostly to fax a great amount of pages. The first problems I encountered was that it would have a hard time turning on at times. The past 2 years or so I rearely used it, mostly to print a few pages a month. Today, it never turned on. I'm pretty disappointed, Im a huge Canon fan and of their products, but this All In One printer left me with a lot to be desired. It seems as if they are made to die 2-3 years after purchased. Im surprised to find out that a number of other customers have had the exact same problem, either through here on Amazon or throughout a number of forums on the internet. A good, quality product should not give in that easily. Very disappointed."
5,Great Printer,"Does it all. Prints, copies, faxes. Had it almost a year and no problems. Had to call Canon once about something I didn't understand and they were helpful and courteous. I had an HP which cost twice as much and it had to be replaced THREE TIMES and still doesn't work. I have had several Canon products and never had a problem with any of them. I cannot say that about HP."
3,Great while it lasts...but not long enough,"The MP780 was a great all-in-one solution for us. It served well and nearly flawlessly for about 26 months -- two months beyond the extended warranty. Now it no longer prints black. I've tried every troubleshoot I can find, multiple times (crazily expecting a different result). Now I've given up. It isn't that this printer or Canon is bad about product failure. Citizen, HP, Canon, Minolta...I've seen them all die in 24 to 36 months. My advice: Get the longest and strongest warranty you can. You'll likely need it."
1,Badly Put Together!,"This product has gaps between the moving parts, which make grinding very frustrating and almost impossible. In order for the blade to cut/chop/mince/grind it needs to make contact with the screen. The only way to do that, is to push in while you crank, so I returned mine and will purchase a better product. Stay away from this thing unless you plan on having both hands on it at all times to make sure the blade makes contact with the screen. A waste of time and money - period!"
4,Couldn't Put It Down!,"I read this book when it was first published in 1982, and am currently re-reading it. It is as enjoyable now as it was the first time around. While this is not great literature, it is great story-telling, and the details, backdrop, characters, etc., show Ms. Conran's first-hand knowledge of the upper crust lifestyle. They made a perfectly decent miniseries of this book (although Phoebe Cates, as Lili, did affect a strange Eastern European accent), but subsequent sequels fell flat. While a tad dated (some of the more shocking events seem almost commonplace now), reading this book is still a wonderful way to pass an afternoon."
2,Super Tool 300 does not fit,I'm sure this is a fine case for some models but the new Super Tool 300 does not fit right as advertised. The tool is difficult to get in and out and the velcro barley latches and I doubt it will remain able to close for very long.
3,Excellent but out-of-date,"Although this book was current when it was published in 1983, it is now vastly out-of-date. It has been replaced by the 2001 Random House Webster's ASL Computer Dictionary."
2,"Not the original ""gaffer's"" tape","This is not like the earlier Permacel gaffer's tape. It is thick, if that's what ""professional"" means, but the adhesive lets go after only a short time. The earlier version stuck seemingly forever, and made for nearly permanent repairs of things, something you can't do with ordinary duct tape which seems to disintegrate over time. It's thickness and lack of flexibility seems to make the end pop up; you have to keep pressing it down. I would suggest the thinner regular version, which seems to function better, or look for another brand. Best place to get gaffer's tape is a store that sells theatrical supplies, or a recording studio that does sound work might sell you a roll. I'm not sure what I'm going to do with this big expensive roll; it's just not very useful."
5,I Have The Import Boots,"I am a broke teenager who can't afford to pay $20 for 3 eps of a 224 anime series. So, I bought a VCD set of the original Toei Series, a boot set of eps 1-120 of YGO: DM, and downloaded the new GX eps.Since I have only the japanese version, I can't rate the new dub, but here goes.The uncut is like a different show. It is much better, and the dialogue covers so much more than the 4Kids version. It contains more violence, swearing, etc., but that's not why it's better. It's the dialogue. The dialoge is SO much different that if you compare them it really is like watching a different show.Great anime..."
1,Not Exactly Uncut,"Although this purports itself to be uncut, it stretches that definition by quite a bit. The subtitles are done almost entirely in dubtitles, merely copying the script from the English dub, and the scenes left in that were cut for the dub are few and far between, along with not really making a substantial difference in the storyline. Either watch this raw, or try to navigate your way through the grammatically-marred Hong Kong subs - this release is just not worth your money."
1,Don't waste your money,"This is a very disappointing product. It is supposed to enhance the image but it actually made it a lot worse. I have a perfectly calibrated home theater and after I put this cheapo upconverter everything needed to be readjusted. Color, tint, brightness. I couldn't believe it. If you are serious about upconverting, invest in a real box like the DVDO iScan HD. Now that's about the performance. About the rest, it sucks even more. The case feels cheap, switching between the different inputs takes forever (like there is a 5 sec delay between the moment you push and it does switch) DO NOT BUY."
5,Best football song ever,"This is the best football song EVER. Even better than my first team Manchester Citys Blue Moon. The Sevilla fans sing this in the Ramon Sanchez Pizjuan stadium before every game, and often during the game too. It's very catchy and you can't help but get caught up in the atmosphere and emotion of it. They are very proud of the club and this song sums it up. Sevilla are now my second team and I've even got this as the ringtone on my mobile."
1,Not What It Could Be,"I had high hopes for this book because the subject vitally interests me. But I was greatly disappointed. It is mainly a compilation of stories gleaned from author's counseling practice, with very little effort to generalize from the stories to make points that could be useful to a broader audience. Authors very occasionally cite names and dates of other research, but there is no reference list on which to check those citations. Seems very unprofessional. Sketchily written; seems like author just gathered his years' worth of notes together, outlined, and made a minimal effort to integrate them. Once again, what may have made an interesting article in a magazine has been padded out to get a book."
4,I like it,"So, I have absolutely NO experience with waffle irons. I received this as a wedding gift and we used it to make a Christmas brunch this year. My mother, who remembers using older fashioned waffle irons, was just a-twitter with praise for this iron. It didn't split them in half, it cooked the waffles nicely (don't know if I like them crispy or not yet) and it DIDN'T STICK. I think that has got to be the most important feature of a waffle iron. We liked the ""ready"" indicator, both for temperature and done. The alarm was a tad shrill but would definitely alert you to attend to your waffles especially if you tend to multitask in the kitchen. This was very user-friendly. Overall 4 stars. Can't go five since I haven't experienced anything better or worse to compare it to. I like this iron very much."
2,Careful - It's a Square Waffle but they use a round element,"As others have said, this waffle iron clearly uses a round heating element in a square iron. Of course that leads to uneven cooking where the center gets overdone, while the edges are just barely cooked.I would not have expected that sort of compromise for such an expensive product.I still have not found a suitable replacement waffle iron for my old GE and Sunbeam units which worked great for many years before they died."
