5,Perfectly chosen moments,"A fine record of mostly instrumental tracks. Apart that is, from 'Perhaps You Would Be More Comfortable' where a lazy half-heard vocal magically appears towards the end of the track at a perfectly chosen moment - great stuff.I think Paul Newman's music is more interesting than Mogwai's - another band whose music I like. Mogwai have become somewhat AOR in thier old age and their sounds often disappear into the background. This album commands attention throughout. Turn it up."
3,CLawson,"I just received my sauna. The sauna arrived quickly, but it didn't look anything like the sauna I thought I was purchasing. I contacted the manufacturer's website on the box and I found out that I could have purchased ""this particular sauna"" for $46 less. I feel a little ripped off. The sauna works fine, but I am extremely disappointed with this seller."
4,"Moderately funny, and very original, magic adventure","Wishbringer is one of the Infocom books, loosely based on the Infocom games. Ignore that; it won't affect your enjoyment of the book.The story is about a scam-artist who must save a Jeckyl-and-Hyde community, with the aid of some magical, but not entirely reliable or discreet, companions. Not as good as The Ballad of Wuntvor or the Ebenezum Trilogy, but an enjoyable light read."
4,NICE PHONE BUT MISLEADING INFO. ON BOX,"I PURCHASED THIS PHONE BECAUSE IT IS EXPANDABLE AND THE BOX STATES THAT ""ONE HANDSET IS INCLUDED"". THE MISLEADING STATEMENT ON THE BOX LEAD ME TO BELIEVE THAT IT CAME WITH ONE OF THE EXPANDABLE HANDSET.THE ONE HANDSET THATS INCLUDED IS THE ONE THAT GOES ON THE BASE UNIT WHICH EVERY CORDLESS PHONE COMES WITH.I YOU PURCHASE THIS MODEL EXPECTING THE EXTRA HANDSET THAT MAKES IT EXPANDABLE YOU'LL NEED TO PURCHASE THE EXTRA HANDSET SEPARATELY."
3,"Really, really, read the reviews......","BATTERY problem not a fluke! It dies after 30 minutes of continual use. It didn't when we first received it, but after a month, we now get a familiar, beep...beep...needs charging. We also have a voice mail box and the light doesn't blink when a message is dumped into our voice mail. (it does for the answering machine). This could be the phone company but I've went round and round with them. We were looking for a phone that contained it all and this is it, but everything needs to work well, also. For the price, I expected a better product."
1,It's worse than you can imagine...,"I'm not often compelled to write negative reviews of products, but I just couldn't help myself on this one. Based on my experience, and the experience of a good friend who also owns this system (we both own the base unit with one or more extensions... I have two extension units myself) I would have to say that Panasonic has made a very poor decision to let this one out of the RnD lab. I've had every problem you can imagine with these phones... the battery life sucks right out of the box... one unit went bad and stopped charging the battery... one unit has a bad display... they interfere with other electronic devices... these phones are a joke. I've had VTech phones before, and they worked great... these phones really do suck."
2,Old technology,"This is a new model. But for some reason its a US model. In Asia and Europe they have a new standard called DECT. Panasonic have a line of DECT phones which sound better, range better and look better than this line.I have no idea why these are not available in the US of A. Consumers: don't buy this old technology models."
5,The Best Phone For your Buck,"I have been using this phone for about 2 weeks now and I have to say that this phone is just about perfect. I have no idea why so many people have battery issues. The fact is that if your battery does not last, go out and buy energizer battery. Its NiMH (ER-P511) there is no memory and it lasts for 10hrs talk time.The only bad thing for me is that, there is no blinking light when you have missed calls.If you are thinking about buying this phone, do it, you will love it. Do not listen to the reviews."
1,Extremely poor batteries,Pathetic product. Batteries hardly last for 15 minutes of talk time. Not worth the price.
2,Review,I bought this phone and everything worked except the CALLER ID function so I returned the phone because I was frustrated. All my other phones in the house are caller id and this phone seemed to have problems registering the caller id. I called up Panasonic's tech support and their tech support phone line was always busy and I could not get a hold of them. I also saw about 4 of these phones being returned at a local retail store.
2,Battery is just awful; everything else is great,"I chose to ignore all the reviews about the lousy battery life. I wish I hadn't. I've had the phone a couple months and the battery is so run down, I can't have a single 3-minute conversation. It's just awful. I'm today shopping for a new phone and will never buy Panasonic again."
2,"Poor Battery, strange Caller ID","After waiting for Panasonic to come up with it's own ""non V-Tech"" expandable phone system, I was excited when this model showed up on the shelves this Summer. I purchased it along with an extra headset. The sound quality was excellent, and the features were nice, but I returned it because the battery didn't hold a charge. After being on ""standby"" for 10 hours, both handsets went from 3 bars (fully charged) to one bar (needs recharging). My old analog 900mhz Panasonic stayed fully charged for four-to-five days. Sure, I could keep the handset in the charger at all times, but who does that?Also, the caller-ID was very slow to post the name/number on the display. After the 2nd ring, ""incoming call"" would still appear. Frustrating. Another annoying thing was the inabilty to auto-dial multiple numbers from the handset. This is needed if you have a pre-paid calling card. Because the maxium numbers you can auto-dial is 22, it is impossible to do this."
2,Big drawback- interrupts wireless home network,"The recording quality is adequate for what it's for. I don't plan to make movies with it. I like being able to see the front and back of my house. However, the user manual is worthless. The biggest drawback is that the wireless cameras totally knock out my wireless home network. Laptops put next to the access point can't find a signal. It uses the same 2.4 GHz band as home routers. Swann said there is no solution, buy a wired system. Defeats the convenience feature, doesn't it? It could possibly interrupt your neighbor's as well. This must go for any other wireless system.I gave this product a low score because of the wireless network problem."
1,Don't wast your money,The cameras won't receive picture through a trailer wall so unless you want to use it in your living room with the receiver in your living room you don't want to buy this product. I recommend one with a cord. I got one that is wired by phone cable and it works great.
1,Pesimo sonido,"Admiro a Roger Williams pero este CD parece grabado de afan, en equipo casero y sin ningun ingeniero de sonido atento.La pelicula es bella y la cancion tambien, pero este CD no merece ni una estrella"
2,"Interesting, but not for everyone.","I have a mixed review of this DVD. For most people, I would recommend instead getting the National Geocgraphic video. I recently ordered both and watched the two almost back-to-back, and much of the video was the same. The National Geographic video, however, was narrated very well.On the plus side for this video, however, this DVD had SOME new footage, and it was not narrated (that can be a plus for some people). For people who are avid ""North Korea watchers"" or researchers, it may very well be worth a look. Since those folks may not need a voiceover explaining what they're watching, the lack of narration may be a bonus. As D. Morris alluded, however, the average person will find this DVD boring."
4,"Nice, but could be just a little bit better","This digital frame has lots of options, such as (a) a replaceable wood frame, (b) musical capabilities (c) 7"" frame. For all this , the price is definitely worth it. However, the only thing that's missing is the ability to play music and pictures at the same time. When the music plays, just the menu shows, but not any picture images."
1,Buy the Philips,"I purchased this Coby product based strictly on the price point and was once again reminded of the old adage, ""You get what you pay for."" The screen resolution was terrible. After reading product reviews and looking at demo models at various brick&mortar stores, I purchased a Philips 7"" frame. The pictures are sharp and I love the 4:3 aspect. I use Picasa to reduce my files to 800x600 size and they appear fanatstic on the frame."
4,"Good value despite some quirks (10"" DP-102)","I bought several of the 10-inch DP-102 as presents and am presently surprised. The LCD is very bright and sharp and the colors are very vivid, a rarity among digital photo frames (I have a 15"" Westinghouse which is double the price but this beats it in picture quality).PROS: Excellent screen. Large, vivid, and has a decent viewing range for LCD. All the media card slots you need (SD, CF, etc). Infrared remote comes in very handy. Nice black or white interchangeable frames.CONS: Strange 800x450 resolution. For best viewing you should resize/crop your photos to this size to use the whole screen. No onboard memory storage, but media cards are so cheap now anyway. Probably USB 1.1 as it copies very slow. Limited remote range."
3,"Okay, I guess.","The frame was attractive, and well put together. My only complaint was the slide show feature that automatically crops photos. It crops them in some strange places. Slide show transitions were a little slow at times. That being said, my grandmother loved it after we filled it with all of the pictures of the family."
5,Great value for money,"This frame is excellent value for money, even with the extra postage to ship to Australia! Nice clear display and love the changeable faceplate."
2,"only 2,000 pictures max.","Overall a nice frame with decent picture quality. However, it has a severe limitation in that it will only recognize the first 2,000 pictures on a USB stick. A severe limitation that Colby does not describe anywhere in its sales materials (otherwise, I would not have bought it).With 18,000+ pics on a 4 GB memory stick, the Coby frame does disappoint. With a digital camera, one does tend to collect pictures at an astonishing rate over the years. Forget about constantly updating/changing your memory device to have other pics to show on the Colby. You will tire of this very rapidly."
4,Coby 10-inch digital photo frame w/mp3 player,"This is a great product. It shows excellent quality images and plays music well. However, it does not have any internal memory so without a SD/Memory card inserted it does not work. Overall, its worth the price!"
1,BEWARE Coby has no post-warranty repair,Coby 4 GB Flash Video MP3 Player with FM Radio (Black)Coby DVD-224 Compact DVD PlayerCoby TF-DVD7377 7-Inch DivX Compatible Portable DVD PlayerCoby DP-769 7-Inch Widescreen Digital Photo Frame with MP3 Player & 2 FramesCoby TFTV1022 10.2-Inch LCD TVCoby KTFDVD1093 10.2-Inch Under-The-Cabinet LCD TV with Built-in DVD/CD Player and AM/FM RadioCoby DP-882 8-Inch Digital Photo Frame with Built-In MP3 PlayerCoby TF-DVD7050 7-Inch TFT Portable Tablet-Style Portable DVD PlayerWas told COBY provides no repair service at any price on out of warranty products. I had a DP 102 pic frame 1 year old and was told maybe I could find a local repair shop.
4,hartmanmhrh,"The frame is nice but it was not what it said it was. I got the first digital unit and the interchageable frame was not in there. I contacted Amazon and they very graciously sent me a replacement. When the second digital unit arrived it was the same way. I ended up keeping the second frame even though it did not have the interchangeable frame because I had to have it for a Christmas present. Amazon said if they sent me another frame it would probably be the same way. Other than the fact that the description is wrong, the digital frame is nice for the price."
1,Ratio problems,"While the Coby (Coby DP-758 7-Inch Widescreen Digital Photo Frame) is a good deal compared with other frames, it has a terrible photo ratio. A standard photo shows up on the frame with black bars on the side which defeats the purpose of having a 7"" frame.We call Coby technical support and they could not tell us the ratio for the frame. I spent about 8 hours trying to figure out how to resize photos and ended up resizing the photos in Photoshop but this is a very time consuming process.I'd recommend paying a little more money to have a more streamlined frame. It's not worth the headache to save a few dollars!!"
1,Don't bother,"Ordered 3 of these on 12/15 and only now, 3 days before Christmas, did I receive an email stating they are out of stock. I refuse to deal with online vendors again when they give poor service such as this."
3,needs to be 'plug n play',"I purchased this for my mom, who is not very tech savvy. I tested it out before I gave it to her and when I plugged in the SD card, it didn't automatically start playing the pictures. I had to go through a couple screens and select the folder (even though there wasn't a folder on the SD card) that the pictures were in before it would start playing them. Seems to me that it would be smart of them to make the software recognize .jpg files so it would play automatically. I don't know too many grandmas and grandpas who would be comfortable going through what I had to go through to get this thing to work."
2,Don't buy for someone who lacks tech savvy,"The instructions are unclear and the user interface very clunky. Do not buy for an older person (or a younger person, for that matter) who is unfamiliar with how to operate nonintuitive devices from manuals translated from another language. It might be OK if you set it up for the person and give it to him or her. I am not familiar with digital photo frames in general, but the screen does seem awfully dark. I presume I could make all the photos lighter, but it gets back to the question, how much trouble do you want to put someone to?"
4,Good product for the price; Gave it to my parents to store travel photos/videos,"I have been happily impressed with this digital frame. It shows pictures very clearly. The videos where showing some distortion in the lower part but I did not get the chance to check different video file format before giving them to my parents. Still recommend, if only for the photo display."
4,digital photo frame,"I have not had a chance to use it yet although I know it is a good product and it's something I had been looking for, especially at that price."
2,Coby Dp-102 10inch Widescreen Digital Photo Frame .......,"I could not put the Digital photo frame together, tried to connect it, all I could see was the pre-installed pictures, Iinserted my own photo card, but nothing happended. Got discouraged and just let it sit. Could ot even fit it backinto the boxes. I am very disapointed and will not buy electronics via mail again."
2,DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!,I bought this for my mom's 50th bday and was extremely disappointed when it arrived. The frame does not have built in memory so you will need to go buy another card if you want to keep certain pictures. Don't waste your money! Go find one that has built in memory. I wish I never bought this frame.
3,Good deal for price,"Image quality is not that good, but for the price amazon is listing this is a good deal"
2,Misleading and Hard to Use,"Misleading: This product WILL NOT play mp3 files while it displays pictures! Coby tech support says they have only four models that actually can do that. If you want something that plays mp3 files OR displays photos, this is the one for you.Hard to Use: The remote control has very tiny buttons that only seem to work about half the time. Even using the buttons on the back of the unit does not guarantee that a command will go through on the first button push. Also, there are buttons that are only located on the remote, so DO NOT lose your remote. Hardware issues aside, the software is not user friendly at all, and the users guide is vague at best.Overall: A very disappointing buy.CAVEAT EMPTOR"
1,"It kinda works, well not really","It does work, sort of. After an hour or so it resets itself back to the setup screen. You must then go through all the steps to see the pictures again. Online help and the web site are useless."
1,Product short-commings not reflected in price,"Not stated anywhere in the manual - if you are using a USB flash card that has more than 2004 pictures, - some pictures will never be displayed. The frame will display only the first 2004 pictures.ALSO the random shuffle mode is not really random at all, the same pictures will be cycled over and over like 1st, 5th, 8th, etc, but other pictures will never get displayed.Customer technical support is rude (they do not even pretend to be polite and hang up on you if you ask questions tey do not know the answers to) and they are not knowledgable. I am an experienced computer engineer and my opinion is that this piece of electronics is not a quality product, however the price is quite high and does not reflect the short-commings."
1,Couldn't get it to work,I could not get this device to work with my computer. Coby's technical support said that it must be defective. I got a second one from Amazon and it had the same problem. Coby's technical support said that Amazon must have a bad batch.
2,USB breaks almost immediately,"I was delighted to recieve this for a Christmas gift. Imagine my disappoint when the unit's ability to read my flash drive inserted into the USB port failed almost immediately. I loaded the first batch of photos on the flash drive and put it into the Coby photo frame. Nice! A few weeks later, I added more pix. Nice again! A few weeks later, I added more pix, stuck the drive into the frame. Nothing! It will not recognize the drive anymore. And I checked the drive on my laptop - it is fine. Now I have to go out and purchase an SD card and an SD reader. More money and aggravation... not nice!"
4,Good product,"This product is good, I bought it because I wanted to view both landscape and portrait sized photographs. The sound is too clear, even at the highest volume. It supports wide voltage ranges.I would have been more satisfied, if it had SDHC support, and the frame a bit more stylish."
2,Mislead on this Product...Does NOT Play Music with Pictures!,"This product is NOT appropriately advertised. Note the music does NOT play with the pictures. I called Coby and was dismissed and told it plays music, just not with the pics. So my question is: Who is going to run home to listen to a frame while having a nice glass of wine?????I'm extremely disappointed in Coby and Amazon for authorizing this ad, as this was for someone who's mother passed away, and the music was imperative.I will be disputing this charge and advise people not to buy from this company."
2,confusing controls,I purchases this as a gift and preloaded photos for my mother-in-law.Because I had purchased a similar product from a different company earlier last year I thought I knew what I was doing. The instructions were confusing and there was no way to load photos into the memory directly from the computer to the frame. A memory card or zip drive was required. This was a last-minute gift and it arrived Christmas Eve or I would have returned it and purchased another product.
1,NOT A GOOD PRODUCT AT ALL,"I purchased a Coby DP679 Digital Photo Frame for my parents as a Xmas gift and after the 3rd use the screen is now dark - not working. Customer service says that since this unit is out of the 90-day warranty, there is nothing they can do (including a repair at my expense). This will be the first and last item I purchase from Coby!Coby DP-769 7-Inch Widescreen Digital Photo Frame with MP3 Player & 2 Frames"
4,"Great, but limited","This is an awesome product. Wonderfully large, bright, brilliant. limits: requires plug in(no battery mode), no built in memory, can't slide show in full screen zoom.Pros: in addition to 1st comment accepts XD memory, plays mp3's and video in addition to photos.*** NOT mac compatibility ***. I would buy again but wish to see the noted improvements"
1,"Good idea, bad execution","I bought this as a gift to my mother-in-law so she can load up her grandson's photos and not have to carry bulky photo albums in her purse, as she does today. The frame is a perfect purse size with a good quality display.Unfortunately, the device does not have a good way to navigate through hundreds of photos it can store. There is a thumbnail view showing 4 on each row. In order to get to the photo #500 from, you have to push next button 499 times if you just turned it on. It doesn't save where you left off. There is no page up and down to speed up the browsing. So, if you loaded the frame to its max capacity and have SD card, be prepare to push next button many many times.Another problem I had that the buttons were not very responsive. It may have been a malfunction on the device I received. When you have to push 500+ times to get to the last photo pushing on an unresponsive button it can be quite frustrating."
3,Unhappy about shipping!,The frame is fine. I have no issues. I was dismayed that I paid more to send it faster. It did not make it as promised. I would like to be refunded this money from Amazon.com as I am a loyal and faithful customer!Jim
1,Believe the bad reviews,"The battery is worthless. I've had the phone for about 9 months, and the battery cannot hold a charge and continues to get worse, and I'm about to buy a new phone to replace my new phone. As the price on this baby already has fallen steeply, I guess panasonic has realized its a dud and you should avoid it all costs."
3,Good but not Awesome,"I bought this phone because I was having difficulty with the dialpad of an AT&T; expandable cordless phone I owned for 18 months. I have always found Panasonic reliable. Overall this phone is good, but not great. The comments regarding the caller ID are fair - it does often take more than 2 rings (as the instruction manual claims) in order to register the number. Not a fatal flaw for me. The other comment is the audio, while sound quality on the receiving end, I'm told, is great, in the earpiece you'll hear voices at a slightly lower volume than you expect. Again not fatal, but should be better for...Follow up one year later - I've had to get rid of this phone - the phone takes nearly 12+ hours to charge the battery. Replaced the old battery with a new one and still had the same problem. I had noticed it was taking a while when I first bought the phone but figured I could live with it - now I know better!"
3,It's alright,This cookbook is not what we expected. Has some good recipes but the print is small and hard to read because the book is a small paperback.
5,A must have record,"Greg Cornelius says here in his review of this record ""all heaven breaks loose""! I wish I had written that! What a perfect description of this record! Bravo to you Greg Cornelius! Impulse should really make this and Meditations a two c.d. set, so you can compare and contrast them, I love them both so don't ask me which is better, but I do lean towards the later version just because I am a Pharoah Sanders Junkie. But both versions are essential. Great great beautiful record, one that everyone needs to hear. But that cover art just doesn't suit the mood at all, come on now, think Gaudi's Sagrada Familia at Twilight instead. Yet another flawless piece of music from the master."
2,Wish I could wear,"The product does exactly what it says it can do, after trying many others I love the design and appearance of this under my bras. I have very large breasts for my size and work in a very conservative formal environment;the last thing I want/need are my nipples showing under my clothes. I loved them, at first. The reason I have rated it so low is that I cannot wear the nipple covers, I wore them without complaint twice, the third time I felt itchy and had red markings around my nipples.The last time I wore them I washed them before wearing, put them on and had to take them out 15 minutes later that lasted more than 24 hours. They are great, if you have insensitive skin that does not irritate easily."
3,Woodstock revisited,"The best song on this Album is a softer, more folk sounding Woodstock than the one done by Crosby, Stills, Nash, and Young. That song in itself is a 5 star in my opinion however since it is the only track on the album that appealed to me I gave it a 3 star."
3,"Good, but beware","This Belgian import is a rather mixed blessing. Some of the songs don't appear to be available elsewhere, but it's hard to know, what with the multiple reissues of Rodrigues material on different labels. There are some great performances here, but also some with bad/weird sound. Some of that is undoubtedly due to the age of the recordings, though the liner notes give no information about recording dates. One oddity: on my copy, the songs listed for CD1 are actually on CD2, and vice versa. The other issue is price: I got my copy from Border's (part of the Amazon ""family"") for $17.98; looks to be a pricing problem somewhere? Fans will want this set, though, whatever the price; there's just no one like this artist."
4,fairly good,i was using my project salvo when i used these paintballs and out of all of the rps balls i have tried these flew the best most consistantly on target
1,Beware of this Seller!!!!,I never received this product. Had to file dispute with Amazaon and my credit card company. STAY AWAY!!!!!
2,Just didn't have what it takes,"It took me a while to get into this book, maybe 80 pages or so. The story picked up and held my attention and then bam!....it switches off to something or someone else before I even knew what hit me. There really are some excellent sections of this book but they just didn't last long enough, bringing great disappointment. This book won't get recommended to my large group of reading friends."
4,Really Good Overall,"A really good story, although I was a little perplexed at the ending.Reads really quickly though, and pulls you right into the mysteries of what's going on.Great for those who love a good thriller!"
4,Oliver's Wars,"Oliver's Wars is a good book. It shows how a boy named Oliver felt during the Gulf War. I really enjoyed the book because it inspired me to learn more about the Gulf War. Oliver leads a normal life until, His dad who is a nurse in the army is stationed in Sauti Arabia. Oliver's mom lost her job so, They have to move to Halifax With their grandparents. Oliver has a rough time with one of his teachers. The school bully who is Oliver's enemy called his dad a sissy nurse. It bugged Oliver so so much. In this book Oliver learns it's important to let out his feelings through writing and painting. Oliver becomes friends with this bully. Oliver has a lot to talk about with him because both their dads are at the war. I would recomend this book to everyone because it teaches you many lessons."
3,Oliver's Wars,Olivers Wars was an okay book. It tells you all about Olivers problems in school and how he feels about his dad being in the war. It is a good book for people who like to know about peoples problems and their thoughts. It took place in Halifax. He had to move there because his dad was in the war and his mom had just lost her job. It is not my kind of book but some people will really like it. It is not really about a war but it is at the same time as the gulf war. Oliver has a twin brother named Jerry. He has a very mean grampa but his grandma knows how he feels and trys to stick up for him. They are both a little shy.Oliver wants to be more like his brother Jerry because Jerry is really adventurous and always takes chances not like Oliver.
5,"A touch of the ""Master""...","A spirtual ""get in touch with yourself"" album... My words cannot equate what I feel inside for this product of genius. This album is a good begining for those that are not familiar with Stevie Wonder. Enjoy."
3,FULFILLINGNESS...YOU BET!,"I remember my brother and I listening to this ""album"" when I was just a kid... trying to be ""cool"" like my older brother, he was right, this is a sexy, delicious stroke of Stevie Wonder genius...you won't be sorry! Especially, the floatty groovings "" Too Shy to Say"" and ""Creepin""...Sit back and enjoy the ride."
5,Clearbrook Preserves are yummy,"I don't know what to say other than I love Clearbrook Farm products. I know it will sound repetitive but for some reason our local markets don't sell preserves anymore. Clearbrook has great taste, good amount of berries and a handy reusable jar."
5,Great Book,"This is a great book. I just bought it a couple of days ago and have been reading it constantly. It is trilling, and tells the story of the Soviet/Afghani soldiers during the Russo-Afghan war. I suggest this book to anyone who wants to read a real good book on this subject. I also suggest reading 'Afghanistan: Soviet Vietnam'. These two books are the best about this mainly unknown subject to the Western world."
4,A reference tool for coming conflict?,"I purchased this book a few years ago and read it at the time. Then after the events of 09.11.01, i had to pull it back out and give it another read. This work shows how a war in Afghanistan was fought in the 1980's. It shows the fears and fraility of soldiers at the fore frontof a war without front lines. It gives graphic accounts of the difficulties found in fighting the Afghanis. It is a book the leaders of the world who will be deciding on whether to put ground troops into Afghanistan should take heed of and take copious notes.Mr. Borovik does the fighting men of the then Soviet Army a proud service by showing the war as it was, not as the Soviet propaganda portrayed it.His insights are invaluable to todays fighting men and women who may be going into harms way in the near future."
2,Disappointing,We are talking music not sympathy and affection so stop praising this band because their singer died but they carried on etc.. I'm sorry about their loss but that doesn't change the fact that DP sounds like a regular college band. Comparing them to the likes of Pantera is either the greatest flattery they will ever get or an insult to Pantera. There are some good songs but only good enough not to change the station on the radio. Buying the CD has been a waste of money for me. (...)
3,Broken Case,"CD was in good condition, however was disappointed when I opened the package and discovered the case was broken."
4,"Not traditional, but has its own merit","The music is soft and relaxing without being sleepy or dull, as I've found some ambient new-age music to be. It's not strictly traditional asian music, but don't let that keep you from trying it out. Rather, it uses traditional flavor to carry the theme of tranquility and simplicity."
5,Excellent spreader,This is so much nicer than the junk you get from local stores. Easy to calibrate and does a great job.
3,tedious,"I had high hopes for this book by the famous Ernie Pyle. It is authorative, but it becomes tedious very quickly. There is no real story. It is a compliation of news clips with names and addresses of soldiers in different WWII theaters. It does give an inkling of conditions soldiers endured in the war, but has no heart that I can see. Read it if you want to see what grandpa and grandma saw in the daily news during the war, when they were mom and dad."
5,70 Minutes of Sublime Hell,"Do you think I'm crazy? I think you're crazy too. So is 70 Minutes in Hell, a German home recording made in 1969 of Charles Bukowski. What makes this so compelling is that nobody can read Bukowski like Bukowski.Buk's 60-plus books offer a glimpse into the world of horse tracks, seedy bars, and sleazy LA rooming houses. 70 Minutes in Hell, with its haphazard recording (replete with comments to the German dude making the recording and the sound of traffic passing by) gives us some insight into the world of an aloof, desperate and drunken man disinterested in the normalities of society.Regardless whether you're an insomniac, a narcoleptic or none of the above, if you're a Buk fan you need to listen."
3,An interesting though not quite convincing account,"Though Johnson does his homework in bringing Rochester and revivals to life, the book is too short. Nowhere do we get background on the Great Awakening; the role of women is glossed over hurriedly; and incredibly Johnson leaves out as an explantion for the interest in revivals one of the most basic assumptions: spirituality!"
1,...ok,it was an alright book it really didnt intrest me but it did give me some few pointers and i would have liked it better if it was in color. Other than that it was ok
5,pop (sort of) perfection,"Two best albums of the 80's in my opinion. The dB's manage to be extremely progressive and pop at the same time. They embody a strange neo-psychodelia in songs like ""Espionage"" and ""Dynamite"" recalling the drawled vocals of sixties classics like the Kink's ""Lazy old sun."" Amplifier sounds like a They Might Be Giants song with a darker twist. ""Ask for Jill"" sounds like nothing I've ever heard before and makes me smile every time (especially in the recorded phone conversation). The song structures are original and surprising with every listen. They never stuck to formula. Timeless!If you like this, check out the Feelies 1st two albums"
1,I cannot rate this CD because there are clips.,I want to listen to the music before I buy it. You guys don't have any audio clips.
3,All right to skim.,"Fairly well written, though a little over-confusing ~ like the life, i daresay, of the protagonist ~ account of the investigation of the murder of a CIA courier. Neither a straightforward murder mystery, nor an entirely convincing account of the secret life. Nevertheless, a good read, and worth at least skimming to the finish. The protagonist is a young woman of somewhat loose morals ~ encouraged by her employer ~ who seeks to discover the meaning behind and avenge her best friend's death."
5,Worth the time to buy and read,This book is engrossing from first page to the last page. When I reached the last pages I wished there were many more pages to read. Excellent!
3,"disappointed, but OK","I have all of Diana's albums and I've been to her live performance at Barbican in London some time ago. I'm not saying that this album is bad.. It's just weak as compared to what I'd logically expect from performer of her calibre and to what we've already seen in her previous albums. It's just not that Diana that I love listening to all through the night. Pics are just great but music...No drive, no passion, no detail... The whole lot of delicate things ""a la DK"" are missing. On top of that, being hi-fi enthusiast (provided that I express my own opinion on the CD which I bought from recognised retailer) I can say that from technical point of view album sounds BAD - distortion is too obvious probably due to high level of recording.I hope that she's not going to continue this trend and surprise jazz fans with yet another ""pop"" album of background music."
2,Yawn. File under easy listening.,"Diana Krall's voice is splendid as always, but ""The Look of Love"" lacks the soul and wit of her earlier releases."
2,Did nothing for me,"I bought this CD based on an article by Stephen Holden in the 12/6/01 New York Times. The article was about the current state of cabaret singing. Holden said the album was ""perhaps the most satisfying collection of orchestrated popular standards to be released since the heyday of Frank Sinatra and Ella Fitzgerald."" I hope not, given how bad the album is. Before buying this album, buy some of the Sinatra albums with Riddle from the early 1950s and some of Fitzgerald's Songbook albums, if you haven't already.This is my first album by Krall. Her style/approach, at least on this album, did nothing for me. It was interesting to see that quite a few of the online reviewers hated this album, but liked her earlier albums. Yet, I found one online reviewer that thought this album was her best and that her other albums were bad."
3,The Look of Love,"No she is not breaking any new ground for either the art of singing popular song or for her career. I suspect that isn'ther concern anyway. You either like the way she sings or you do not. I have no patience for the arguments over weather she is areal jazz singer or not or if she is as original as whoever. Whocares? Listen to what she does and decide for yourself. What this album does, for these ears at least, is establish a moodthroughout. Claus Ogerman's string arrangments are lush spine-chilling beds of velvet. I'll give it 3 stars. Meaning, I haven't heard all of her albums so I don't know where to place it and because I think a three-star album is still worth listening to. People tend to overrate what they like and underrate what they don't."
2,It's So Dull,"The blame for this poor cd must rest with Tommy Lipuma and Klaus Ogermann. They ovewhelm Ms Krall completly with syrupy one paced arrangements of beautiful songs, on her previous album at least there were sparky trio and quartet tunes to stop it being too sweet. Get a new producer and go back to the small group format, it's what you do best."
1,Moving away from her roots-this CD is a HUGE disappointment!,"I'm sure I am in the minority in my opinions of this CD, but-this new album represents a giant step for Ms. Krall away from her jazz roots and, sadly, toward ""popular"" even ""elevator"" music. Even though Dianna has had great commercial success with her newer CDs, I still feel Dianna's best recorded work was done on her CD ""All for You"" a tribute to the Nat King Cole Trio recorded a few years ago. I own all her CDs and have seen her perform live thus I do have some perspective on her body of work. This new album is far too bland, quiet and boring. As some other reviewers have noted-after a while, probably due to the slow tempo and heavy orchestration, the songs start sounding the alike! (...)"
1,Jazz? No jazz-ish.,You'll be seeing countless copies of this CD (and all of Ms. Krall's other work) in used CD stores across this nation for decades to come.
4,An improvement over her last album,"While I do prefer her ""Love Scenes"" album over this one, I have to say that it is an improvement on her last album, ""When I look in your eyes"". This one, even though there is an orchestra, it tends to compliment rather than take away from the songs. Plus the added bonus of having the great Christian McBride on bass, and Russell Malone on guitar. Her voice sounds a lot better than on her last cd too, richer and with more emotion. I thought her previous album was kinda flat and dull, and I almost didn't buy this album because of that. But after hearing ""S'Wonderful"" and the title song on the radio, I thought I'd give it a chance, and I'm glad I did. Diana is becoming a really good torch singer, and ballads are definately what she seems to do best."
5,S'Wonderful......S'Sexy,"One of the great torch singers of our time has done it again with this great album. How to go one better than before? Why add the London Symphony Orchestra and Los Angeles Session Orchestra.Take a listen as the London Symphony replays the intro of 'Love Letters' at the end making it an awesome listen. My favourite is 'Cry Me A River' (thanks NK) but the whole album is a gem. Even with the Symphony orchestras, you can picture her in a lounge setting singing just to you. Oh well- Dream on."
3,Not her best,"It could just be me, but I'm afraid The Look of Love is not Diana's strongest work (that title would fall to her last CD).The Look of Love sounds over-orchestrated. And the song selection seems a little wanting. Plus, Diana's excellent piano playing seems to be missing here. I'm afraid that the record company is trying to make her a big star, and they've taken control of everything they can to make her a star. Nothing worse in the music industry than when this happens."
3,"Interesting, but where is Joao?","An interesting middle of the road attempt at Bossa Nova, without quite connecting. But S'Wonderful is -- although credit should be given to Joao Gilberto's Amoroso 1977 album where S'Wonderful and Besame Mucho originated. Not a coincidence that Claus and Tommy were arranger and co-producer on Amoroso. Try the original and see how much Miss Krall admires Mr Gilberto."
2,Queen of the Blahs,"Surely there must be others who feel, as I do, that Krall is an over-hyped, mediocre vocalist lacking in passion and depth, with an almost complete inability to communicate the emotional essence of a lyric. So who's buying all these CDs? Probably people who also think Norah Jones and Peter Cincotti are just swell and wouldn't know a real singer if one bit them on their posteriors, I suppose. Hey Krall fans, ever hear of Lee Wiley? Peggy Lee? Oh, I forgot, they're not only not young and blonde anymore, they're DEAD, so they're not ""relevant"" to your late-twenty-something musical ""tastes."" Krall is for people who voted for Bush because ""he seemed sincere"" and go to see the latest ""blockbuster"" CGI-laden movie because the Fox TV critic called it ""a white-knuckle thrill ride."" The triumph of media hype over taste and discrimination is now complete."
4,No Julie London,"Okay, I love the fact that Diana Krall has given us this collection of classics/standards and that, as usual, she has handled them all with such care. Very sexy date music. But sometimes the technical proficiency loses some feeling. While this is not a problem with every track, I found something amiss with ""Besame Mucho"" and ""Cry Me A River."" In the latter case, I found that she doesn't can't get the same feeling across that the late Julie London gave us, but maybe that is just me."
3,More Sappy Stuff:not bad this go round,"Diana finally hits me with a refreshing release, well somewhat. The title track does wonders for her as that is the most perfect melody and lyric for her, along with Dancing in the Dark. However, what in the world did she do with S'wonderful and Besame Mucho. ??? Oh and Cry Me River, did bring me to tears. As I continue to listen, I sometimes find myself yawning to sleep. Her lazy voice goes into the lush instrumental interludes that are wonderful but then back into the lyric and yawn. I would like to see a shot of adrenaline given to her, spice it up a bit break new ground, rock that piano a bit. Everyone else has in their great careers, why not Diana. Imagine S'wonderful with a bit of a swing to it. Overall this is not a bad release, I just keep expecting more only to get the same predictable routine."
3,I sure miss the trio....,"It's lush, gorgeous, lulling. All the same, I miss how Diana and her trio used to COOK! Every piece on this recording is a ballad, so the tone is consistent. Everything about this collection is restrained....I'm sad to say that this is the most uninteresting CD that Diana has released. I hope that her next recording is more like ""All For You,"" which I think is the best work of hers to date."
4,Diana Krall with Strings,"While many jazz purists have panned ""The Look of Love,"" others will find this album very enjoyable. On this CD Ms. Krall is backed not only her usual quartet but, on many of the cuts, she's also backed by the London Symphony Orchestra. She sings many of the standards, and her voice is strong, smooth, and seductive.There are many well known romantic ballads on this CD, including ""S' Wonderful,"" ""Cry Me a River,"" ""Besame Mucho,"" and ""The Look of Love."" Some may scoff at the lush strings (frankly, I'd rather hear Diana Krall's voice) but every jazz artist seems to do a ""with Strings"" album once in their career, and this may be hers.A word about the CD packaging. Ms. Krall is a very attractive woman, and the photos in this CD only emphasize that fact. I know we shouldn't buy CDs based on the CD art, but, in this case, it's an added bonus."
4,Like an old friend...,This was my first listen of a Diana Krall album and I was not disappointed. It reminded me of the music my parents would play on a rainy Sunday when I was much younger. Perfect for listening to in front of the fireplace with someone special.
5,Exquisite,Krall never dissapoints. She has such a haunting and lovely voice!!I am amazed at how talented she is and she is very attractive also.Love the shoes!! :)
3,OK,"I enjoyed this CD, but I would like it better if some of the songs were not quite so slowww. I get sleepy when listening to the CD."
4,easy listening and good songs,"If you like easy listening with some modern jazz then you willprobably like this album. Her voice is soft and sexy, and thebackground is good."
3,Nothing Special,"The liner notes on the CD are filled with sexy pictures and offer no information about the music. Get the idea about the performer's biggest talents? Marginal, nothing new."
2,"""Look of Love"" great rendition but album is over produced.","I really adore Diana Krall but this long awaited new album is unfortunately a huge disapointment.For a start the sound is very mushy and the whole album is just over arranged and produced. I really can't classify this as Jazz, just pretty background music.Diana is at her best with her trio and not backed by large orchestras as here she just sounds lost among all the too-lush sounds.Where are the fantastic piano solos from ""All for you"" gone.I hope the next album will be a dedicated 'Christmas' album and the producer leaves Diana alone to do what she does best; play and sing."
5,One of the Greatest Novels of All Time,This is a book that is unforgettable. I read it five years ago and I still have dreams about it. I still find myself in the scenes and epochs that Mr. Mani traverses. I am a professor of literature and so I must read more than most. This book has the hand of God on it. It stands out. Buy it and love it.
2,Lousy Build Quality but there are better Sanders ( Ridgid / Makita )!..,"I cannot believe that I paid over $250 for this Plastic Sander !.Paying over $250, I expected better build quality from Bosch but this is made more of Plastic and I also felt electric Jolt in my hands many times.Build Quality is Sketchy and won't last for more than 6 months if you use it over 1 hour a day. I am not sure where $250+ prices comes from ?.Check the Ridgid from Home Depot, as it feels solid and does job way better and costs only $170. ( Made in Germany ).I am returning this one for sure.I loved bosch tools in the past but lately I am returning more Bosch tools and going for Ridgid/Makita/Dewalt brands as I use my tools over 14-20 hours a week and I am feeling that Bosch Tools are over priced and low quality and won't last over 1 year.Disappointed with this one."
5,awesome,"this tool really works like it should, you know you bought a tool that was not made to be a facsimile of the real thing"
2,"Perverse, grotesque, obsessive!","James Ellroy steals the spotlight of a horrendous crime. This ""best true crime book of the year"" turned out to be a tell all of his perverted world of drugs and sex. The moment I thought I would be able to learn more or anything at all about the actual murder, Ellroy included his personal memoirs to twisted sexual fantasies. When anything pertaining to the actual homocide was mentioned it was as though the police logbook was restated. I was extremely disappointed as well as turned off by Ellroy's explicit descriptions of immoral acts unrelated to the actual murder. This book does not do Jean Ellroy or her murder justice!"
5,REFRESHING,"How many times can you listen to Old Mac Donald Had a Farm, London Bridge, Pop Goes The Weasel, etc.? I grew up with them and a little goes a looong way! What's GREAT about this cd is there are catchy tunes that not only the kids LOVE, but don't drive me nuts! Most of the songs are originals by Laurie Berkner that you've never heard before! There are a couple of traditional songs like Erie Canal but, even on those songs, they're not done in the exact traditional way. This CD is so good and I highly recommend it for anyone w/ small children. My almost 3 year old loves this cd and has already learned some of the lyrics to some of the songs. It's repetitive which kids love, but not in a way that completely drives an adult crazy. This cd is a total WINNER! I'll be buying more Laurie Berkner!"
2,Buy some Beatles instead.,"I had heard good things about Laurie Berkner, but I'm not a fan. To be fair, I don't like most ""kids' music"" - one happy exception being The Bottle Let Me Down - but this one just really grated. I'm sticking with playing Rolling Stones and lying about the lyrics."
2,Not what I was expecting...,"considering the hype. This is too sappy and lightweight for our tastes. Children's music, good children's music, should satisfy both child and adult. This CD is too much fluff and her voice just grinds on me. Now, I know it's about the kids, and my 2 year old doesnt miss this one in the cd player at all. If you want an alternative, try Dan Zanes or They Might Be Giants for more adult friendly children's music."
3,Cute,"The music is cute, but not great, some of the songs are a little dull. My children do not love it. There are some better children's music choices out there."
2,yawn,"Oh, I know what I'll do. I will make a kids record with some really popular songs so the parents will buy it. Then the kids will love it because it's music ""just for them."" If there was such a thing as packaged music for kids, this would be it."
5,great,I gave this cd along with a melissa and doug 3 little pigs toy and the 3 little pigs story book because there is a 3 little pigs song on here. You can't go wrong with a laurie berkner cd for a gift for a child.
5,The buzz on Buzz Buzz,Based on warm reviews on Amazon I bought the CD Buzz Buzz to play when our grandkids come over. 7-year-old Rachel and 5-year-old Josh really enjoyed it. Therefore I recommend it.
4,Burton's Masterpiece in an All English edition,"This was first published in 1927. It was edited by Floyd Dell and Paul Jordan-Smith. This is an all English edition, so that a great deal of Burton's quotations have been replaced."
4,unwieldy but very well done,"Excellent popular edition of an indispensable work. My only complaint is that the volume is too thick and heavy for comfortable, convenient reading. I am tempted to cut it down the spine into two volumes (which is what the publisher should have done). Go for it -- you'll really enjoy Burton's endless diatribes, which are infinitely inventive. A true feast."
4,Make My Day!,"What a beautiful album! I can listen to him over and over again. I am always and will be Josh's fan but recently I accidently discovered ""Mario Frangoulis"" the Greek crossover singer (Sometimes I Dream, CD) who I enjoy as much."
5,Beyond Incredible,Awesome... even greater than awesome. That's all I can say. He's a God among singers.
5,As Good as the First?,"When I bought the first Josh Groban album I didn't think that it could get any better. When I got the second album my theory remained true, but it is just as good. Great CD!"
1,THE BIGGEST!!!!!!!!!!! DISAPPOINTMENT IN YEARS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I loved Josh's first cd. I have eagerly awaited his second one for 2 years. But this new offering is so bad I am shocked!!!!!! It is monotonic, all the songs sound the same. The whole thing is bombastically overproduced!!! Sounds like he is singing to a Yanni concert. The arrangements are way tooooooo loud and the percussion is outrageously intrusive, making him virtually SCREAM every song. And what is with all these foreign language songs? They are neither interesting nor worth hearing twice. Josh has such a beautiful voice, but whoever produced this mess has done him a MAJOR disservice. If you loved the first cd, I cannot state strongly enough, DO NOT BUY THIS CD!!!!! I hope he changes arrangers, producers, and conductors and lets someone else help him pick the songs for the next cd. I can't give up hope that this beautiful voice will be used for a better effort."
1,Poor response,I have sent an email to the person who sold it and have had NO answer. They put the wrong CD in the case so I did not even get what I bought. I would appreciate it if you somehow would help me get this right. All I want is the right CD
3,"come on, I know you can soar!","What I want to know is, why is ""Oceano"" the only song on this CD that totally kicks ***? The rest is very mellow and nice, but that song is incredible. His voice is great, but he doesn't seem to let it go very much. In the middle of ""Oceano"", at the end of the verse, he just lets go and ROARS. It's an absolutely beautiful moment and left me thinking, ""Yeah, I want to hear more of THAT."" If you're taking requests for your next CD, Josh, please give me just two or three more songs like that.His English songs are a bit too schmaltzy for me, but I can honestly say I never listened to anyone sing in Italian before for longer than 3 seconds, and I love every Italian song he sings. So he's opened my mind a tiny bit. (What's next - I sell the minivan?)It will be interesting to see what he does next. Maybe he can politely ask David Foster to get his foot off his throat a bit and just blow us all away with the full range of his voice. I think he's got it in him."
1,"Been There, Done That","If you have the first Groban CD, don't bother getting this one. They are indistinguishable. The man has a beautiful voice, now all he needs is someone who can choose his music."
1,Too Many Foreign Language Songs!,"This guy has a great voice, but the problem is he hasn't got any songs to sing. His first album had just a few English songs and the trend continues on this cd as well. I find myself skipping all of the foreign language songs and only listening ot the English ones. No offence, but I don't like to listen to words I can't translate! There are only 5 English songs on the album! Why can't he sing an entire album in English and then release the French version separately? I'm taking the English songs from the debut album and adding the English songs from this album to make one album that I don't have to skip through! My finger is tired!"
2,Josh Groban,"When Groban first appeared he was new and exciting. Now he has just become boring, and predictable.everything he sings sounds the same. His voice is just to monotone... to put it directly he is a one trick pony.Yet his concerts are sold out events and his recording sell like crazy.However Josh you have just lost a fan... You are so boring, your voice is actually depressing."
1,TERRIBLE!!!!,"This Cd is just anoter typical piece of Josh Groban's garbage. There isn't any good unique or different about him unless you consider singing lame sappy songs in dead languages a good thing. There is nothing positive that is distinguishing about him. If you want good music you should listen to Measure of a Man by Clay Aiken, or even better his single Solitaire. In Solitaire, Clay sings with more power and color than Josh Groban has, and looking at his ""progress"" so far, ever will. I think listening to this is just a waste of time, and about anyone in the world must have better things to do."
1,Not worth the money,"Hey everyone, I am very mad at Josh Groban and his new CD. I was looking forward to listening to it when i bought it and when I played it for the first time i realized that this CD is not worth it. He is off key, sings in Italian (this is America speak English) and is SOOOO ugly. His hair looks like poop. This compact disk is just so horrible i want to warn people out there that they are going to waste their money."
3,Over-hyped and lacking true Celtic flair,"I bought into everything I had read about this album ... that it had great energy and really delivered the goods. And I loved the fact that it brought in our neighbors to the north in a way you just can't get with Shania Twain !?!? But I was downright disappointed with the music. If this is what the industry is now calling high-energy Celtic music, I think I'll go back to Dervish, a group whose sound is truly worthy of being associated with the ""Fire"" of the Celtic genre."
5,Uplifting Poems,Thru His Eyes is a poetry book containg a collection of uplifting poems. Reading the poems written by Kevin Alawine will touch your heart.
2,AN OK READ AT BEST,This was definetly not one of lisa kleypas' best books. Maybe it was that the lead characters were so boring and one-dimensional. We know that Julia Wentworth is a great actress but the book just dosen't tell you alot about her outside of her career. There also really never seemed to be any real feelings between the main characters. They seemed to be sexually attracted to each other at most. Damon Savage was also unreasonable and obsessive. I think it says alot about the story that the secondary character of logan scott(who came off as cold and a jerk)was the one you really wanted julia to end up with. The author should know that you're never supposed to make the secondary male character outshine the hero.
2,Definitely not her best,"This is not one of M. Kleypas' best. Trite plotlines, simplistic writing and shallow characters come across as a first-time author. I had a lot of issues with this story. To name a few. She explains why the characters feel a certain way instead of conveying the emotions through the story. The female lead is ridiculous. The idea that British society at that time would blithely accept a ""Duchess"" - of the highest peerage! - entertaining the lower classes on the stage is too far-fetched. (The cultural responsibilities of a Duchess went far beyond simply being concerned over snide comments about her possible affairs.) The whole idea of them rebelling so strongly against an arranged marriage - no matter their ages - is a bit off mark as well. Arranged marriages were still the norm in the upper aristocracy. there are so many irritants in this book. I was dissapointed. Save your money and go for a different Kleypas - or get Stephanie Laurens' Devil's Bride."
3,Too much sex,"I enjoyed this book, but would have preferred less sexual description. I will not read anymore books by this author."
2,Not as Good as her others,"Both STRANGER IN MY ARMS and SUDDENLY YOU are better than SOMEWHERE I'LL FIND YOU. I am an actress, so I was very much looking forward to reading this one. But I just didn't find the chemistry between Julia and Damon all that exciting. And about halfway through, the book started to become entirely too long. Or was this because I was reading it in an airport? Who knows?I've read the sequel, BECAUSE YOU'RE MINE, which I thought was much better. I found Logan to be a much more interesting hero."
4,DataShark 70003 Universal Cable Stripper/Cutter,Works just fine for cutting/stripping ethernet. Only go around once.
1,The horror...the horror...,"I had to read this for academic decathlon and I must say it's one of the most boring, blandly-written things I've ever read, and I adore reading."
1,Don't buy this edition,Just about every sentence has missing spaces between words. A typicalsentence might look likethis.You wouldn't believe how fast this makes reading go from a pleasure to a chore. Amazon should not even offer this edition for sale!
4,I liked it,Enjoyed the history and the author painted a very authentic picture of the old west. A good book to sit by the fire with in the winter.
1,"Terrible, terrible editing","I wish I had read the readers' comments before I bought this edition. In every line, words are run together. Here are a few examples from the first five lines: amissionary, gardensof, wasfamous, thesouth, overhanginga. It's very annoying to have the flow of the novel interrupted in this way. Pay a dollar or two more and get a better edition."
3,Novel Better Than Publication,"While Death Comes for the Archbishop is not a novel I'd place in a ""Top Novels"" list, I found it an interesting story about interesting people; a story about people who leave their (relative) comfort and spend their lives striving to attain their personal goals in a harsh and alien environment. Less attractive was the particular publication, listed by Amazon as CreateSpace. Perhaps through some artifact of OCR digitalization, there exists about one instance per line of run-together words. Examples like ""smoothlywhitewashed"" and ""thechurch"" are some small difficulty, but some proportion such as the line-end hyphenation ""dayth-rough"" or ""torecommend"" caused me to pause in an effort to figure out this unfamiliar word. The publication was about eight dollars cheaper than the next, but it turns out this was a penny-wise purchase."
4,Good Hard Rock CD,"Wild Horses is or was a good hard rock band that got overlooked by meny people. Singer John Levesque has a real good voice and I wish he was around longer than he was. Bareback is a great CD beacause of the great riffs and lyrics in songs like ""Had Enough Of Your Love"" and ""Whiskey Train"". Jeff Pilson from Dokken also plays in this CD. This CD is kind of hard to find but if you can find it I would pick it up."
5,Heart-warming,"Hayes' novel is a heart-warming story about loving each other in spite of skin color or educational levels, or income, or culture. Plainly it's about how people should love each other, and how to give and take in a relationship. It is a masterful storyline by a commendable author. Don't miss this one!"
5,Doesn't get any better then this...,"Wow, these guys are great and their music is pretty much technical as well as satanic which is always a plus in my book. All the elements are in place and the lirycs are truly disturbing... If you like brutality and unforgiven dm? Get severe torture's ""misanthropic carnage"" its worth the purchase! Buy it !"
2,Not a pleasant read...,"A strange mix of ""gritty psychology"", psychic babble, and a touch of mystery, this book was not fun to read. The hero was too extreme (too rich, too titled, too sneaky, too damaged from past life) and not at all likable. The heroine was more contrary than strong. Then the 'reincarnation' subplot is just silly. I don't know what Lisa was trying to do, but she missed Fun Reading. Skip this book."
2,Not good,"This is the only book of Lisa that i don't like. i read it once and have not touched it since. I found the prince disappointing, you would think he would treat the heroine better but instead he almost broke her lively spirit. It only got better at the end with what you would expect of lisa Kleypas but I expected so much better of the prince that even though the end was good almost great it not make up for what he was at the beginning."
2,Worst book I have read in a long time,"I could hardly wait to get through this book-Out of respect for the author, I always try to finish a book, but this was a chore! I have not read anything so shallow in a very long time."
3,Difficult to Read but Good,"Because of the descriptions of the experiments performed on patients in Psychiatric hospitals this book was not easy to read. But the author left enough of a mystery that I had to finish it to solve the mystery.The ending had several unexpected twists to it. I was still left wondering why Emma talked for Sarah first though. To get more stars the author would have had to answer that question for me and she did not. That puzzled me because getting Emma to talk was the whole focus of the book.This book is definitely not for everyone, but well worth your time if medical 'experiments"" don't bother you."
1,Worst Product Ever,The program crashed my external hard drive and made it impossible to run my older version of Norton Antivirus. Even better Tech support is non-existent unless you pay an extra fee. Do not buy this product!
2,Norton Save & Restore [Old Version],Norton Save & Restore [Old Version]~ Windows - Too complex and potentialy unreliable for saving and restoring files. Sorry to have purchased it. I've installed and worked with many programs for many years. Too many programs in the Norton Save & Restore that can go wrong in the computer operating system. An external drive with a back-up program can do the same job without the potential problems.
5,"Alfred Deller, arguably the world's greatest counter-tenor and renowned performer of Purcell","This splendid disc shows Alfred Deller, a great & certainly celebrated counter-tenor performing Henry Purcell's music. He was the son of a musician at Court, and held royal appointments until his death at the early age of 36. Purcell worked in Westminster for two Stuart kings after the Restoration, and then Queen Mary over a total period of twenty-five years. These are historical as well as beautiful Baroque works."
3,"Pop, Rock, Country and Soul for Grown-ups","This is not a groundbreaking, earthshaking, gimmicky CD ... just a cohesive, engaging, satisfying release by an old pro who still has something to say. It's cohesive in its rootsy sound and feel, and it's engaging in its unforced approach. It's not twangy so much as it displays the directness of country and soul. I give it three and a half stars.This is the first album by Parker that I've bought since ""Squeezing Out Sparks"" (1979 was a long time ago), and whether it's the extra miles on the artist or the listener, Parker achieves the sort of straightforward, ""grown-up"" fusion of reflective pop, rock, country and soul that Nick Lowe achieved in his most recent string of underappreciated CDs. Indeed, at times in my first two listens, I could imagine Parker inviting Lowe, Tom Petty and the ""Love and Theft"" Bob Dylan to sit in on the album sessions -- and if you consider that a compliment, you might want to check this CD out."
2,Not so powerful for making VCD,Lacks transitions between slides of digital pictures. Makes the slideshow somewhat flat. One good thing - can put music and also is quite fast in creating a VCD
2,For the beginner perhaps?,"I bought this thinking it was similar to PSE but only cheaper. I used it for awhile before uninstalling it and using the free PSE I got with my camera (after that got an upgrade for it as well).I think quite honestly that you'd be better off investing in a REAL editing program, you'd be much more pleased with it once you learned to use it properly.While using this program, its easy to use, I give it that much. But colors don't come out accurately which makes the prints look bad. The light and contrast is hard to get just right as well since its preset options. I remember it being a few things I liked on it but not enough to keep it as an addition, moving files between photo explosion and PSE makes it a lesser file which usually means lesser quality product in the end.So if you're a beginner and need something to just play with, this probably will work for you. But if you're thinking about getting into editing photos more seriously, please reconsider PSE or a better program."
1,Made in China - Cheap Plastic,"Made in china, cheap plastic. What was delivered is dull and does not resemble the picture I see advertised by amazon. The picture was probably enhanced be specific lighting. Very disappointed with the quality of materials."
2,Late Coltrane of a poor standard,"I found this CD to be one of the least impressive ever by the great tenor John Coltrane. This reissue finds him in the studio not long prior to his death. The songs are of a solid standard, however Coltrane's screaming and screeching at the higher pitches is disruptive and quite simply non-musical. Alice Coltrane on piano however is breath of fresh air, backing the sax work quite brilliantly. The drumming and bass work is also quite advanced. Prehaps I have been a little hard on Coltrane's performance here judging upon other reviews. However the two stars remain and I issue a sincere warning to the casual jazz listener."
4,great listen,"As always, I'm excited to pick up the latest from The Lapse. Heaven Ain't Happenin' definitely had me a house rockin'. Just as the Van Pelt got better with time, this release is a more cohesive attempt than their debut album. It displays the ever insightful lyrics of Chris Leo with songs like Buffet, (""we make meals out of continents, we make meals out of condiments...""). Who else would have you singin' phrases like, ""mustards and party dips"", and ""relishes and after dinner mints."" There's a great interplay of vocals with help of Toko Yasuda... something missing from the late great V.P. This is definitely a keeper."
5,"An extension of Trane's ""A Love Supreme""--a masterpiece!","From the variations on the bass vamp from ""A Love Supreme"" to Pharoah's unique solo voice, this disc is a masterpiece. The album seethes, wahing over you with the intensity of Trane combined with the warmth and love of Pharoah Sanders. An essential disc; Impulse! always did it, and they've done it again."
3,Questionabley useful,I'm not really sure it helps soften the water in my humidifier. It turns the filters pink---not sure it's helping the water quality.
4,Great for what it is.,"For the price, you can't go wrong. However, the ""XL"" designation gives the impression that this is larger than it is. Its is not very big, but can hold maybe a six pack of empty cans, a fast food back, and a few napkins. It serves its purpose well, as long as you don't mind emptying it out once a week.I'm glad they included the weight, as it would otherwise have a tendency to topple over. While that's happened once or twice for me now over the course of a few months, I had it loaded up with top-heavy materials. Wouldn't have minded just a little more weight, though.For reference, this fits perfectly in a 2012 GMC Sierra between the console and the middle of the bench seat.In short, I would purchase this item again without any hesitation---and be happy about it."
2,too small,I should have read the fine print better. This product is labeled XL - but it should be labeled XS.it is not large at all. it works fine but it is not even close to the full volume on the inside that the outside view implies.If it was a $5 purchase I would not be bothered but at $16 it is a rip off.
5,Works great,This has been working great for me. I have a normal sedan size car and this fits quite nicely on the floor and I haven't once had it tip over. I feel that it was a good buy.

1,the jewish war writ tiny,The print in this edition is so teeny-tiny it should never have seen the light of day in this font.Very disappointing.
4,"Great Book, Full of Wisdom, but missing....","This ""review"" is not a reflection on Joko Beck's book. I read it years ago and it became my ""Bible"". I lent it out and it never came back to me. I ordered a replacement and was looking forward to this, as stated in the contents on Amazon: ""This Plus edition includes an interview with the author."" I can find no such interview in my Kindle version nor does the paperback table of contents list such an interview. A bit of false advertising on Amazon's part I'd say."
4,A Page Turner!,"This is a great series to get hooked on. For a week or so, I think my fellow passengers on the train thought I was insane- I was laughing, squealing, and wincing just from this book. Please check it out and enjoy!"
2,"Complicated, Messy & No Foam!","I bought my Senseo so all I had to do was basically push a button and this just complicates the process. It's so tricky & messy and you have to fill it just so, and worst of all NO FOAM! Buy the New Improved Brown EcoPad it's much easier, produces foamy coffee AND friendly to the environment."
3,a comprimise product,Yes you can make good coffee with this product and save some money while doing it. It's kind of messy and doesn't seal as well as when using the pods. I would give it a b-
3,So-So,"It works...but only if you use the correct grind of coffee. Otherwise, I found that it leaks and makes a horrid mess."
3,Too complex,"The Senseo is all about automation: you fill it with water, drop in a pod, push a button. A perfect cup of coffee every time.I bought both the MyPod and the EcoPod. The EcoPod gets used everyday, the MyPod is sitting in a drawer.With the MyPod, you have to deal with a tiny filter, and a tiny scoop; you have to watch the Senseo because it will not stop brewing automatically.The MyPod was a neat idea, but not quite executed properly.The EcoPod is easier to fill and with it the Senseo will stop brewing on its own."
2,"Good idea, bad implementation.","It seemed like a good idea.When using the Presto MyPod, my Senseo can't tell when the cup is full. This is probably because the configuration of the MyPod doesn't allow the Senseo to reach full pressure. If you don't stand by the machine to shut it off when it's done, you'll wind up with a counter full of water.The MyPod makes watery coffee with no foam. I am definitely disappointed in this product."
1,"All Nlot(s), No Story","The characters are totally unlike any from the classic Conan Doyle series, only the Holmes name has allowed this work to fester on. And fester on it does, if edited from novel to a short story, it would still be poor, just less tedious to plow through."
1,Trust Mr. Cokers Review,"I just want to reinforce the value of Rory Coker's review. This is one of the only books in my life which I have stopped reading IN THE MIDDLE. Thats how bad it is. The situations are preposterous, and, to true Holmes fans, the character of Mycroft is nothing like the all knowing, all powerful, but never moving figure from the Canon. Avoid at all costs - life's too short!!"
4,Generic but Entertaining,"Seven guests are chosen by their fiend-like host by reason of their mutual enmity and are imprisoned in a snow-bound country house to see what results from their tension and mounting hysteria; which is, of course, murder. Throughout, one is conscious of straining for effect, and, until the murder, the reader will find this one of the author's most tedious and uninspired jobs since the early books. The matter is not helped by a particularly irritating hero, a snobbish and precious aesthete, nor by Alleyn's late appearance, after which he does little except talk to witnesses. After the murder, if one can accept the large doses of hysteria, both masculine and feminine, the book becomes quite solid, and there is a novel twist on the alibi by wireless gimmick."
4,Thoroughly Enjoyable,"Wealthy, self-indulgent Jonathan Royal has decided to amuse himself by hosting a houseparty--but not so much for the pleasure of his visitors as for the satisfaction of his own sense of mischief: his guests have been selected for their antagonism toward each other! Needless to say, a number of kettles soon begin to boil... And murder is the result!Well read mystery fans will probably spot the killer on the basis of previous experience, but DEATH AND THE DANCING FOOTMAN offers one of Marsh's better plots--and as usual she creates a vividly drawn cast of characters and presents her tale with considerable style and plenty of wit. Long standing fans will enjoy it and newcomers will be converted! Recommended."
3,Not enough Alleyn!,"In _Death and the Dancing Footman_, Jonathan Royal, an eccentric gentleman (in the old sense of the word) decides to amuse himself by inviting a group of guests who antagonize each other. With a group of people unable to stand each other staying in a house during a snowstorm, the inevitable occurs, namely, murder. While I almost always enjoy the plot, writing style, etc., of Ngaio Marsh, I really love Chief Inspector Alleyn. Therefore, I was disappointed when he didn't appear until the last third of this book. Yes, he solves the murder, but you don't really get to see him interacting very much with the other characters, which is part of the charm of these novels."
2,predictable,"The book started off well and I had high hopes for it, but the ending was predictable. This does not seem like an Inspector Alleyn book because he is barely a part of the book. Very disappointing."
3,Definitely different,"This is the first Sonny Rollins album I have heard, and upon listening, the title track is definitely different. It is a 20 minute piece that sound like post-bop jazz crossed with avant-garde crossed with Rollins' sax sounding like New York City taxis honking. The other pieces are closer to more traditional jazz - very good playing by Rollins and his group."
3,Lightly effective,"Relatively raw session from the seminal saxophone player in post-bop mode, exhibits a few atmospheric oddities but more or less follows the straight and narrow of well-honed, though predictable chops."
2,Careful how you cut the cheese :),"Pro: comes apart easily for cleaningCons: comes apart easily even if you're not ready. The grater cutters don't extend all the way to the sides, so if the chunk you're grating is wide it just rubs along the edges making it difficult to turn."
1,"Looks nice, works terribly","We purchased these cheese graters to replace another similar set that we had that broke over time. This product looks exactly the same as our old ones, but performs completely differently. First, the arm that pushes cheese towards the grating wheel seems to be soldered on at an incorrect angle, serving to only cut the cheese in the hopper rather than push it down. Secondly, the grating wheel is not held into place by anything other than pressure, and frequently falls out (sometimes, very embarrassingly onto customer's laps). I hope to find adequate replacements for our old graters, because these are just not doing the trick."
5,Stevie's Overall Best Ever,"From the haunting opening of ""Too High,"" through ""Living for the City,"" ""Higher Ground,"" and ""Jesus Children of America,"" this is perhaps the most accessibly listenable album ever to deal so hard-hittingly with modern issues. Which is not to say the album isn't without it's lighter, more beautiful moments. ""Don't You Worry Bout a Thing"" is a wonderful Latin number, and ""Golden Lady"" is one of my top contenders for ""Most Beautiful Song Ever,"" of which it's in competition with Stevie's own ""Summer Soft"" and ""Do I Do."" Buy this album! You will NOT be even remotely close to dissappointed!"
5,Stevie Takes Music To A Higher Ground,"Stevie best album with cutting edge songs for its time. This was when making a statement on a record mattered and often Stevie's messages hit the mark and made a difference. This album sorely needs an upgrade in packaging as Motown did with ""What's Going On"". Innervisions was as important in 1973 and retains its importance today. Motown needs to remember and recognize this album's significance in the early 70s."
2,I really wanted to like this book,"I used to live in Brooklyn, right in Carroll Gardens, where most of this book is set. I had heard such great things, and it had gotten such great reviews, but in the end it really disappointed. The main character has Tourette's as we are CONSTANTLY reminded. It seems that the author was using the Tourettes as a crutch in developing the story or even to pad the book with endless lines of drivel. Didn't add a heck of a lot to the story. Actually, nothing added a heck of a lot to the story. The story wanders, rather aimlessly, through three or four days of misadventure for some small time thugs. There were glimmers of an interesting love story, but it is abandoned. Too much, really, is wrapped up too quickly and unimpressively at the end. You're waiting for the big kick, but it never comes.I read quickly. A book this size is usually a weekend's work. Here it was three weeks. And it was work. Not recommended."
5,"Great Characters, Well written","I read about 150 books a year, and Motherless Brooklyn is one of the three or four best I have read this year. It is kind of a detective story, but not really. It is a serious, well written book with unforgettable characters that raises serious questions about relationships, disabilities and what life is all about. I recommend it highly.Boyd Lemon-Amazon Author"
1,Nothing good to say,"This book had more about Tourette's syndrome than the mystery. In one of the last chapters, the story was summarized. I wish I had skipped the rest and just read the summary. If you want to know about Tourette's, then you might like this book, otherwise, skip it."
2,"poor writing - warning, spoilers","Just finished Motherless Brooklyn - rudderless bookthin! brotherfist chagrin! - and find myself disappointed enough to throw the book across the table. The verbal tics - perturbingshticks! - served as no more than distractions, certainly had no point in the plot. Speaking of plot, there wasn't a single development that I didn't foresee (well OK, the Julia part), and the pieces that might actually have been interesting (like whether the Polish guy existed and what Bailey represented) were never resolved. Took Lethem about 70 pages to get going, and petered out about 50 pages before the end, when he simply uncovered all the ""mystery"" in one long narrative chapter. How dull. What serious writer ends a book with ""Make like a tree and leave. Tell your story walking.""? Lethem is supposedly an accomplished writer. If so, he can do better than this - Betterwish! Letterbliss!"
2,book,Didn't care for book (story) after I received it. Was used for a book club read. We are picky readers.
3,"good locally, so-so globally","The book starts well -- the author obviously loves his Brooklyn and its characters -- but the plot is overconvoluted, and if you want a pulp thriller, go to the masters (Chandler, or, for a euro-trashy version, Voris Vian'sI Spit on Your GravesSort of like many recent movies -- great production values, weak plot."
2,Very disappointing,"I'm surprised to see that this book has generally gotten such positive reviews. I was excited to read it after hearing the author discuss his new book on the radio, but I found it to be ... not very good at all. The writing is fine, and the Tourettes thing is kind of well done, but the plot is absolutely terrible - a sophomoric pastiche of hard-boiled detective stories. I read the whole thing only because it was a quick read and I hate to put down a book, but I really didn't care what happened in the end, and then the ending turned out to be the worst part of the book. Not sure why this author is getting such hype. Perhaps his new book is better."
3,Memorable and re-readable,"This is simply one of the best novels I have ever read. It is sweet, exciting, sad, and very funny. I was completely taken by the lead character and his Tourette's -- there are a couple of hilarious scenes I can still recall though I read it at least a year ago. In one, he's being patted down by a cop, and his Tourette's gets the better of him and he starts patting down the cop. ""Now stop that!"" the cop says. In another, someone puts into his mind the task of deciding by taste in which factories the Oreos in a package were made -- Tourette's is off to the races. And all along, the guy is trying to live a life and find love and do the best he can despite an extremely difficult start in life. I fell in love with Essrog."
4,four stars for the Tourette twist,"Otherwise, I would just give it two or three stars. But if Lethem does not have Tourette's, he still does an unbelievably authentic job of giving us its quirks - especially the stuttering, bizarre free association wordplay - in an eccentric and likeable character. I wish there had been another character I wanted to root for, however.The detective storyline is pretty standard. What distinguishes it is its main character whose disorder threatens to defeat his attempts to solve a murder case at every turn. This may not be enough to keep some readers' interests, but if you're interested in psychological twists, this one is as impressive as any I've come across. I only wish the same originality had been given to the rest of the book."
3,Loved Lionel...plot needs work.,"Appreciated greatly the author's ability to put the reader in the mind of Lionel who had Tourette's Syndrome. Similarly his descriptions of the Brooklyn neighborhood came alive. I laughed and was saddened in several passages. This was easily a 5-rate. However, the plot was far-fetched as one waded toward the end of the book and not believable and this was disappointing and would lead me to not recommend this book."
3,Appealing narrator but inconsequential plot,"This narrator of this novel is an appealing character, but the detective story didn't do much for me. My interest decreased more and more until it petered out completely, and with 30 pages to go I stopped reading and never felt motivated to pick up the book again. There was no building of tension and no discernible plot movement, and a revelation about halfway through the novel struck me as no big deal.On the other hand, Lethem can be a beautiful writer; there are some nice set pieces in this book, and he portrays some realistic and tender relationships. I particularly liked the quirkiness between Lionel and Kimmery.Over time, Lionel's Tourettic outbursts grew annoying and repetitive -- octaphone! Liable Dishrag! -- although now that I write this, I see that perhaps this was the point.I'm ambivalent. This is the only book by Lethem that I've read, and he seems to be a talented writer, but the story just didn't pull me in."
5,Brilliant,"Just adding to the general aproval that this book has garnered. I thought it brilliant and compelling. Though I wasn't particularly involved with the plot the quality of the writing and characterisation was sufficient to make it a ""5"" reqardless."
3,Study in alienation,"A considerable strength of this book is its willingness to take risks. Another is its use of a narrator with Tourettes syndrome; it eloquently communicates the alienation of being different without even having to talk about it very much. Simply through his lonely existence, the narrator speaks to that part of all of us that doesn't feel it quite fits in.The author's ability to use language and turn wonderful phrases is also notable.Unfortunately, there are some glaring weaknesses too. The dialogue is bad, unnatural and even embarrasing to read in places. The plot is half-hearted, difficult to follow and pointless. The use of Tourettes is interesting at times, heart wrenching at others and cute at still others, but despite how realistic this portrait of the condition might be, I got tired of looking at the world through a mishmosh of odd phrases and found myself slogging through the second half hoping it would get better.Worth reading because it's different."
2,Eh. Just eh.,"I don't know -- this just isn't that great a book, so why is everyone going gaga for it? It's not all that well written (some sections are painfully awkward), it's not that great a mystery (although the main revelation about the villain's identity is well delivered), the business of viewing everything through a Tourette's lens is handled in a ham-handed and tiresome fashion (i.e., take an element of ordinary life, describe it briefly, then have narrator comment ""That's just like Tourette's if you think about it""), and you exit the book disappointed, especially if you entered expecting something great.Not horrible, but not very good, either, and definitely not outstanding."
4,The saga continues...,"Chip Harrison is back. This time he finds a bus ticket to Bordentown, South Carolina. Chip gets himself into trouble and then charmed the local sheriff who helps him get his Social Security card a driver's license. Lands a job as a bouncer at the local bordello and falls in love with the preacher's daughter. Better than No Score but a far cry from Block's series about Bernie Rhodenbarr and Matt Scudder it is light enjoyable reading."
2,Not on the level with Block's other books,This is from a series Block wrote early in his career. I think most people who read Blocks mysteries will be disappointed if they pick this up. It is fluff and not so interesting.
5,good stuff for little minds and little hands,0ur 16 mo old daughter got these for a Christmas gift. she's learning all of her animal names and/or the sounds they make. It didn't take her long to be able to put the cubes in on her own and she loves it when she hears the animal noises. We always get a big grin for big accomplishment.
3,"A little mechanical, but worth a listen","Mr. Vieaux is a great guitarist, especially on the technical end, but he seems to miss some of the expression, nuance and drama that some other players have gotten from these Sonatas (Segovia and Hoppstock especially), and his tempos tend to be on the slow side. But the CD is worth it for the Sonata Classica alone, since there aren't many other recordings of it, and Segovia's was a bit flawed..Personally, I'd like to hear Vieaux record Eric Sessler's Sonata, since it was written for him."
5,Concise comic book on forgotten scandals,"Vankin does a great job of concisely and completely dealing with long forgotten scandals, without too much crossover into his previous books (Conspiracies, Cover Ups and Crimes and 60 Greatest Conspiracies) and he does not pick easy targets. The Lockheed Scandal, the Wilson-Terpil Affair, several minor celebrity sin-fests, even something on tired old Watergate get comicized here. The book focusses on Hollywood, society, political and big business scandals, and so distinquishes itself from the other Big Books--on the unexplained, criminals, martyrs, urban legends, weirdos, losers and freaks. To coin a Vankinish observation, that list looks more like readers than topics the longer it gets. The first book in this series--from Factoid Books, a front for Paradox Press, which is an imprint of DC Comics--was the excellent Big Book of Conspiracies."
4,Notorious by 5 After 4,"Vito Rezza is one of the finest and most creative drummers in the world, who demonstrates fearsome talent. He composes, plays, sings and stuns everyone who sees him perform. Notorious is unique, fresh and very hip. It does away with musical parameters while maintaining the genius of Jazz, by melding rock, metal and reggae into jazz fusion.Tracks:1.

5,factual,"For women who love serving the fashion machine, this book is useless. But for women who want to know how to dress to break into the ""good old boys"" network, who want to rise above their upbringing, or want to stop being treated like bimbos and trash, this book is priceless. Molloy's research into what sort of colors impress juries and potential buyers is incredibly useful. He even tells you how to dress to be a successful doctor. I find Molloy incredibly sympathetic to the needs of real women, including large-size women and particularly women of color."
1,Why would anyone write this book?!,"John T. Molloy writes a detailed description of the outfits women must wear to get to the top in the business world of today. Along with clothing, Molloy also gives women tips on makeup, hair, accessories, etc...He gives exact tips of colors and fabrics to wear, things that are usually obvious to people in the business world. (example, for an important meeting, you should wear a classic color suit, not neon green!)Molloy's point of view is not one of mainstream america, although he seems to think so, stating at one point that he has ""millions of fans"".Molloy also discusses weight issues, and says that if you are not thin, you cannot make it in business. Molloy recommends plastic surgery and says it ""works"" ,especially for women over 50.Overall, I detested reading this book. Molloy is egotistical, condescending, and a horrible writer about a topic that is ridiculous to write about in the first place."
3,Job-Hunting? Buy It! Read It! Use what works for you!,"Yes, this book is definitely written by a sexist. But, the tips, especially no pants, limited brights and reds, always wear a jacket, appear to be right on target in today's corporate world for women. His insights into ""casual day"" were right on the money.Colored illustrations would have made this book an 8 or 9.I used the tips and received a GREAT job offer in a major city."
2,The book for women's success,"New Women's Dress for Success is great book for women who are working in a business environment like a company, a hotel and the government. It is for those who want to dress attractively and efficiently, but not too bright. After I have read this book, I realize that what I wear is really important to my career. As a high school senior, I will carry the message of the book on my choice of clothing, and I need to dress efficiently and attractive to be successful in college and my future."
2,"Old dog, old tricks","Quite adept, though not innovative as today's young guitar stars. It's good for nostalgia and the occasional 60s style costume party."
2,China Quality?,"The ""plastic"" starter gear broke after less than 15 starts. It seemed to spin faster than the previous starter did, with more power."
3,A philosophical read.,"This is primarily a character study, and rare view into the Chinese gentry. This is not an ""exciting"" read, but is well-written and great for deep-thinking female reading. It did take me a while to get through it because of this. I wasn't ""grabbed"" by it, but I didn't regret the time spent reading it."
1,not my thing,"when i picked this up i thought it would be a little ambient and urban like some of fat john's other beats featured on cartoon network, but this really was some sub-par work. it was like he was bored making this album, not much personality, not much depth, not much focus on anything in particular: noise. not my thing, but thanks anyway."
5,Possibly my favorite book of all time...,"I love this book. It is a great Southern novel set in the 1940's. I just wish Terry Kay had written more like it. But it seems no two Kay novels are ever alike. He is a great story teller, one of my favorite."
5,LOVE IT!,"This is one of the first CDs that my daughter (almost 3) and I both love and could listen to over and over without getting sick of. We borrowed it from our local library and when the CD was due we had to go buy our own copy! It's a great mixture of original and familiar songs and has us singing the songs all the time, even on our morning walks!As a mother and former educator, I listen to a lot of children's music. But THIS is music I actually enjoy!I strongly recommend this album for children and their parents!"
5,Excellent!,"We love this CD! We purchased a bundle with Laurie's Buzz Buzz CD, and are very pleased. Easy to sing along, easy to handle kid's music. Parents will enjoy it too and sing along in no time. I'm happy to play this anytime for my kids."
3,Cute,"The CD has some fun and cute songs, however, some are dull. Not the best children's CD on the market today."
5,my boy loves Laurie Berkner!,"Fun music for adult & child. Which is fortunate, considering how often I must listen to it!"
5,Mommy loves it too!,"My 17-month-old daughter and I dance around all day to the songs on this CD! We've loved Laurie Berkner since finding her on Noggin! Thanks, Laurie Berkner, for giving us some music that the whole family can enjoy! Even my husband knows the words! Highly recommended! We'll be giving Laurie Berkner CDs as birthday gifts! UPDATE JANUARY 2006: My daughter is now 26 months old and still loving Laurie. She knows the words to all the songs, and I think Laurie's CDs have helped her with her language skills, because there is so much repetition in the songs. Repetition is so important for toddlers, so we keep playing it, much to my daughter's delight!"
5,Great smooth Jazz!!,This girl does some really nice things with the guitar. A few nice vocals here and there. If you like smooth jazz you'll surely enjoy this artist!
3,nice but high toner costs,"This is a grand price for a color laser printer and all but the price of the toner cartridges makes this less of a deal when it comes time to refill. I found them anywhere from $136 - $190. If you aren't a high use user, your cartridges will last for a year or two at a time but to replace the four colors is $600-800."
1,Horrible Printer LEXMARK C534DTN,"ONE STAR BECAUSE YOU CAN'T CHOOSE ZERO. I would strongly recommend against purchasing this printer. I purchased a c534dtn December, 2006. I understood the unit would have a 5 year warranty. 1 year plus 4 years for registering. After less than two years of use, the unit is showing a ""950.40 NVRAM Mismatch"" error and is not useable. I contacted Lexmark and they said the unit is out of warranty - that the warranty is only a year (i plan to continue following up on this) and referred me to a service technician. The service technician told me that to fix the unit, the whole system board would have to be replaced. The system board is $699 (and no stock of the system board shows available). Additional labor costs for installation of the system board (minimum $300) would drive the repair cost above the total cost of the printer. STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRINTER -"
3,C534N Color Laser Printer,"Received it ok but set up was slight problem, the on-line manual/technical helped in which (red tape)locations to remove. It took about 15 minutes. Contrary to what everyone said or wrote, upon research I found that Lexmark ships these with toner cartridge starters that for the black are rated for about 1,500 pages! See their web site for confirmation. Noisy when it starts up and when left on (in powersave) it will start up and power down by itself. Printing both black and color are very good. If it wasn't for the cost of cartridge refills (only from Lexmark) and the lack of generic cartridges it would be an excellent buy.Only if you can find it economical for the refills should you go ahead with this printer buy."
3,good that we got it for cheap,"we got this printer for about 900 when they had a rebate for 800. so essentially we only paid 100. the printer worked reasonably well, until we had to change toner cartridge. that's where they get you. very expensive cartridges. paper capacity is okay if you don't do high volume. it gets noisy though, as the printer will just warm up for no reason every 2 hrs or so. also it takes a little long to start printing. we bought genuine cartridge, but notice that the initial print jobs now comes out dirty looking. it will clear up after running 10 pages or so. maybe the drum or something else needs to be replace soon. but then I wonder if it is cheaper to buy a new color laser if I have to replace all the cartridges and drum. I'm sure now there are better ones out there so for a net price of 100 I don't feel too bad. but this would not be a printer I will recommend. it also weights a ton and is huge. I wonder how I'm suppose to get rid of it when I no longer want it though."
3,The Lions of Tsavo,The history of the Tsavo lions is Ok but it gets quiet technical.I finished the book but was left with a feeling that the author was trading off their name.There seemed to be too much left to conjecture.
5,Making the social statement without losing the pop touch,"Stevie Wonder / Talking Book: Stevie continued to make great pop hits with ""You are the sunshine of my life"" and ""I believe..when I fall in love"" (which both open and close the album). Yet he had obviously been impressed with Marvin Gaye's great ""What's Going On"" album and Stevie takes the opportunity to make his own powerful statements about the world as it was with ""Superstition"" and ""Big Brother"". The rest of the songs are all amazing, combining the hard angry bass with a love song like ""Maybe Your Baby"", and the like. It is a remarkable album. Five Stars."
2,Eh...,"Sort of amusing, and full of the fun nonsense of children. More than a little difficult to understand sometimes due to its British colloquialisms and terms. I found that for some reason I couldn't finish it in one sitting, as it got sort of tiring. The stories are all pretty unique though."
3,Children's book,"I purchased this, thinking it was an adult scifi. It's not. As a children's book, I think it's a bit of a stretch to a youngster. To mature for a child, not written with adult mentality in mind. Falls somewhere in between....."
5,Great book!,"This book is a child's fairy tale book. I got it thinking it was going to tell about all the different legends of dragons. Some of the reviews are of the book, not the kindle version. Highly recommended!"
2,NOT illustrated,"Be warned that the $5.99 paperback edition with the purple and black moonlit dragon cover is NOT illustrated, despite the Amazon description. Since the enchanting illustrations are a major reason I loved this book as a child this was extremely disappointing and I'm now going to have to find an illustrated edition. Otherwise the book is fine and the cover picture is quite attractive.Amazon should have separate webpages for various editions when they differ in important respects. I feel this was misleading advertising, but returning the book would cost more in postage than it's worth."
1,not as advertised,"The editorial reviews portion of the description for the kindle edition state's ""with H.R. Millar's original b&w illustrations"". There are no illustrations at all in the kindle edition that I received. I paid $2.99 for what is available for free from Project Gutenberg. It even has a reference to the Project Gutenber License terms at the beginning of the book!"
4,WHY only 4 stars ?,"OK,I will tell you. it is because, for me ,Edu singing some of his finest songs ""em Ingles"" is like putting catsup on a FILET<that's why! hahaha! I understand the reasons for this , believe me, but this is no rational to do such a ""HEINOUS THING"", seu Edu! Of course, there is enough GREAT stuff on this cd to warrant it's purchase, You may LIKE the English lyrics too! Anyway, the musical ""guidance"" of Hermeto Pascoal in conjuntion w/ Edu's strong compositional concept makes this a great jump off point to further explore the musics of EDU LOBO--- my suggestion ,FIND ""Cantinga de Longe"",This is ""the one"",but enjoy this just the same ! Sarava Edu Ok,here's your 5th star--hahaha!"
5,Great Brush,"My dogs love this brush! We have three chihuahuas, two smoothcoat, and one longcoat, and they line up to be brushed when I get the brush out. The longcoat never like being brushed before, but she actually comes to me for this brush!"
5,SUN SHIP: overlooked gem,"this is a really great album. the music falls somewhere inbetween A Love Supreme and John Coltrane Quartet Plays album. the pieces are very loose and free, but are held together with a confident and tight musical direction. this band was a well oiled machine at this point in their career and this album just solidifies that fact. things would change greatly after this album."
3,enjoyable to watch,The chase has one thing going for it.Charlie Sheen now it is not his best work but enjoyable to watch
5,Powerful,"I would recommend this product to anyone who is into meditation or shamanic journeying because the way the music flows works beautifully for either one. Maybe a bit too intense for massage, depending on the tastes of the client."
3,CENTER STREET,"Enjoyed reading this novel...actually based on fact, as I understand it...amazing story of what kids can accomplish when banded together! Cannot wait for the follow-up to come out!"
2,Mine burned out too,"I have to join the others to report that my drill burned out drilling 5/32"" holes in concrete for Tapcon screws. I did have it for a few years but it didn't get a lot of use. The only mitigating factor here is that I did use the drill to mix thin-set mortar and drywall compound about a dozen times. I was careful not to stress the motor too much when doing this, but it could have caused the early failure. Overall, I'm a big fan of Bosch tools. I love the planer, jig saw and angle grinder. I hear good things about their rotary hammers too. Second only to Hilti. But I think I'll try the Milwaukee hammer drill next. It has a five year warranty and I'll be sure to hold on to my receipt."
1,Exchange first damage CD cover and got another damage CD cover,Exchange first damage CD cover and got another damage CD cover. I will have to find another place to buy this CD where the CD cover is not damaged with a 4 inch or 5.5 inch crack on the cover. Both CD's where not protected when shipped.
2,A weak Norton offering.,"I LOVE Andre Norton, but this is weak, even when considered as a (very) juvenile book. For Andre Norton, this book (Winged Warriors) is extremely weak as are the other Star Ka'at books."
5,Horse lover's delight,"This was one of my very favorite books in about 5th and 6th grade. I can't count how many times I read it. I'm from a rural area where rodeo is an extremely popular pasttime for many people. Rather than focusing on the PEOPLE involved in rodeo, this one uses the people to tell the story of an amazing HORSE in rodeo history. The illustrations by Sam Savitt add to this beautiful book."
2,My experience,"For those of you that may be looking to use this product for things other than cold sores, as I was, keep on looking. I used it religiously for two weeks, even though it smelled terrible and stung. I was careful to use it as directed. It did not speed up the recovery process. In fact, I healed a lot fasted after discontinuing use. The only thing I've found that helps so far is antibiotic cream with topical pain relief."
3,Above average metal,"Jesus H!!!!! I can't believe people think there's any hardcore or punk in this record. Punk fans, please pay attention. You will hate this! If you like lame metal records like Godsuck or Mudvayne or Korn, etc, by all means get this. It's very good at what it does, but do not be fooled that it's even remotely punk because it has the word punk in the title or because it's on Epitaph. Epitaph puts out tons of non-punk stuff (Tiger Army, Death by Stereo, etc). Please believe me - save your money!!!!!!"
1,Where do you draw the line?,"The shape of punk to come?I hope to hell not!First off, more heavy metal headbanging tunes than anything else.More Metalica than The Clash.If you liked Killdozer, this might be for you.Old has become new again, get some Dead Kennedys, Germs, Bad Brains, Fear, Sex Pistols, Richard Hell, Black Flag, OpIvy, Descendants, Subhumans, Exploited, Stooges, Ramones, even The Vandals, before you even think about getting this. Then think again!"
5,This is New Noise!,"I bought this album after hearing it on a friends cd player. And then I happened upon the video ""New Noise"" NOT on MTV. On a local TV station. I was blown away. This band is for real! I bought the vinyl because all original punk music was on vinyl. This may be unlike anything you have ever heard. It is a must for everyone's musical library! And finally the lyrics have real meaning. Get it now!"
4,The shape of punk that should have been,"This records was on my wishlist for about 2 years...finally I got it. It is exactly what I expected from it; intrepid musical rage that gets you to the point of just send it all to hell. The world is wrong, mega commercial music sucks and there's nothing we can do about it but scream. This is the message I got from the album when listening to Protest Song '68 and New noise. It is simply great fast harcore music that very few can dig.Must listen at your car while driving very, very fast...the sensation is awesome."
5,The best modern hardcore CD nowadays,"REFUSED from Sweden have teamed up for the last time to give us the ultimate smash of modern hardcore music ever. They use old school riffs and combine them with several electronic elements. On top of that mixture sings the most aggressive voice you've ever heard. This music is better than any American hardcore stuff, listen to it, you will see."
4,Exactly what I was looking for,"Nice set for a reasonable price. Holds up to our 90 lb dog and 2 1/2 year old playing near it. I use it in our living room to hold blankets, and it holds two queen comforters and a small throw blanket comfortably. Really cleans up my living room and matches the rustic look in our log home."
5,Le Super Groove!,"'Le Groove Eclectique"" is the best compilation of lounge dance music. A super international vibe creates the perfect atmosphere good for dancing. Get ready to escape your present state and take a ""journey"". Your mind takes flight and the body follows!Amidst this marvellous bounty Mark Gorbulew has woven a true gem called ""Haman"", his own original composition. All I can say is....YES!!!!I do believe a new master has arrived on the scene. Mark Gorbulew musically weaves you into a groove like no other. ""Please, Sir, I want some more....."""
1,"An Egyptologist says ""NO"" to Budge","I am an Egyptologist who teaches an online course in Egyptian hieroglyphs to the general public. While this book is widely available, don't let that fool you into thinking it is at all reliable. The one reason it is available is because it is out of copyright and the publishers can print it at will and reap all the profits without paying any royalties. If Egyptologists had any say over it, the book would be banned, as it is completely outdated and wasn't even considered a good book when it was first published nearly 100 years ago. When I first started studying Egyptian myself, my instructor started off the class by writing ""Budge"" on the board and enclosing it in a circle with a slash through it. That's how bad this book is. In my courses, students use and like James Allen's book on Middle Egyptian. It's recently published so it is up to date, and is written in a way that makes Egyptian comprehensible to the modern reader. It's infinitely better than Budge."
1,WTH,Ok first off I havent even read this book in its entirety but through the first pages the author doesn't even give credit to the people of whom is writing about for actually creating the language! Stay away!!
5,Hartman and Coltrane,Very quick service. CD was in very good shape. Good price. What more could you ask for
2,"hmm, high points and low points","Hmmm, i bought this, and i'll take a few tracks from this for mixtapes, but the album as a whole flops. Other reviewers said his other album is better, I dont know, I havent heard it.Lights, labial, and lysine are good tracks, the other stuff aims high and misses.Lights reminds me of quasimodolabial reminds me of tipsyand lysine reminds me of they might be giantsSo its pretty wild on the influences, and the sound is full of variety, but the other tracks are let downs. They try but don't have the fun and cohesive sound of these tracks. I like the videogame sounds, but the album doesn't use them on more than 2 or 3 tracks."
2,meh.. cheap clasps,"Not really the Mil-Spec type quality I was hoping for. The strap clasps are plastic and detach easily. They haven't broken, but I don't see them standing up to much real abuse. I've had them detach quite easily on a couple occasions as well when i put my hand on the clasp while carrying it on my shoulder, (since it's a rather natural place to rest your hand.) Having one end of the strap detach sends the bag to the ground pretty quickly if there's any weight in it."
3,It's okay.,"It is a typical monopoly game, so if you like monopoly you will like this. It is not educational, but students younger than college-search age might think it's cool because of the college 'mishaps' that get them in trouble."
2,Missing Pages,I got this book very fast but there are a lot of pages missing. This is a real pain when I am trying to do homework and the pages are not there.
5,Lovely music,"I just got my Sam Stryke Emerging cd and love it. I am not an expert at all about music, I only know if I like something or not. I feel this music in my heart and it is so nice to listen to while cooking dinner and relaxing with my family."
5,Fantastic Bargain,"Pros: Very lightweight, picks up abundant dirt and dust, powerful, very quiet (quietest I have ever heard), easy to empty cannister, washable filtersCons: NoneThis is a great replacement for my 6.5 year old Eureka. I did not know I had so much dust and dirt in and on my floors. Great for tile and hardwood floors, too."
2,Not so good,"It's a mistake to buy this- ge something that protects the screen from scratches, or you'll regret it."
4,"Rich, powerful presentation of Celtic songs","I first heard this artist performing with the Chieftans in San Francisco; unavoidably, her album doesn't live up to the strength of her live performance. Still, this recording does a respectable job of capturing her rich voice and virtuosic vocal dexterity as she sings complex Celtic songs. The instrumentation is not particularly noteworthy, but the exceptional vocals make this CD definitely worthwhile for anyone who like Celtic music or powerful and melodic singing."
1,How can this book called a classic?,"I had to read this book for school and in my opion the book is not in any way enjoyable or outstanding. It is supposed to be about a young boy maturing but the few changes that happen to him in extent of about two years are subtle and unimportant. He does learn about death although through the red pony (why is that the title of the book when the pony is only mention in the first two chapters then forgotten?). This book merely sleeps along drifting slowly and clumsily between chapters. It would have been much better if it went more into depth of the little boy's parents' and grandfather's history. Why Gitano, the old man who lived in an adobe house near the farm, went into the mountains is not told leaving you to make up your own conclusion. The only part of the book that stands out is the grandfather's speech at the very end of the book about westering and how the times have changed."
3,Megan's Review,"It takes palce in California.Its a bit of tear-jerker but the author makes the scenes appear with really good detail.A young kid lives on a ranch, then years pass and he loves the pony he saw.As a young boy he trains to ride the horse.The emotional part is when the pony gets sick.In the story Jodi is a settle boy but as is down days.So jodi and his pony are like best friends and are there for each other.I would recomend to people who like the western type of books with animals from ranches."
1,The Red Pony,I am so thankful you have on-line reviews.I had my grandaughter at a fair and she rode a red pony.For whatever reason I was aware that there was a book about a red pony and I told her I would find it as she was so enamored she wanted to bring the pony home.Thanks to this review I WOULD NEVER purchase such a work.It escapes me as to how persons become famous righting out their own angst.Might I add that Alexis is soon to be 4 and in Chronic Renal Failure.We read JOY-filled books...our angst is close at hand and this book would have been a terror!PLUS the paper back book is rated for ages 4-8 yet the hard cover started at 8..THANKS!PS 1 star was provided for the computer!
2,whatever..,This book leaves much to be desired. It was very dry and I did not into get it. I really expected alot more from this short book but was very dissapointed. I must admit that I simply read it only because it was a Steinbeck. I would pass on it and read one of his other works.
1,If there were 0 stars that is what it would get,"Well lets see the dang horse dies by the middle of the book. I am not sure on exact page, because i found more use for the book as a fire starter.The only reason i didn't stop reading was because it was required for school. It is a shame that such a Prestigious author like John Steinbeck couldn't have done better. That is only MY OPPINION though decide for yourself, but you well probably think the same as me."
3,"This book is realistic, but dull.","I think this book was very realistic, but very boring and I think the only good part in it was when Jody strangled the vultures, which was quite exciting."
3,Touching novel,"Like most of Steinback's novels, ""The Red Pony"" takes place in a ranch in California. It deals with a kid growing up to be a man and going through lifes stages. Though this books is read by younger kids it really takes many years in life to understand its subtle meaning."
1,I've seen deeper depths more interestingly covered !,"This book is horrible and is extremely dull. It was absolutely the longest 95 pages of my life. I am now reading James Agee's A Death in the Family and I love it. It keeps you hanging, but it explains everything in the next chapter. The writer leaves you gasping with his amazing grasp of the English language. And for the person who said ""Stay in the kiddy section"": I love deep books, but this deep pool [The Red Pony] is muddy. Horrible. . . Horrible. . . Horrible. . ."
2,"Oh, John Steinbeck, why?","John Steinbeck is one of my favorite authors. I love Of Mice And Men, East of Eden, and The Grapes Of Wrath. But this 4-part story of a a boy and a horse (which isn't even about the horse that much) is pointless drivel. I'll admit, I liked the first part of it, which is great and good enough to warrant two stars. The rest of it feels disjointed. I couldn't wait to get done with it.It isn't a terrible book, but it isn't good at all. It's below average, and below average is not what I expect from the writer of Of Mice And Men."
1,"What, prithee, is the point?","this book had no problem in it, and thus had no point. there was no solution, no content and to put it in the words of my liitle sister, ""no nothing"". Sure, there were a few, almost a negligable amount, of themes and symbolism, but it is difficult to be engrossed in a literary work without a problem. The character did not have to fight within himself, he did not have to worry about nature devastating him, and he had no important conflict with any one. i would not recommend this to anyone. afterall, the only thing this book has going for it, is that it is short, so the torture does not last too long."
1,TERRIBLE. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY.,Terrible. Don't waste your money on a lousy book like this! THE RED PONY deserves about half a star. It is awful! The first chapter is about the boy getting the sorrel pony. Then the pony gets sick and a graphic desription of how they cut its throat to remove poison is given. Then the pony dies and the rest is about an old man and another horse who...DIES! Everything dies in here and the story is poorly written.
5,Excellent preview of coming conflicts in emerging nations,"Kaplan prescient in visiting future trouble spots of emerging world, which inevitably bring US into conflict with insurgencies or other global powers."
5,Travel to a forgotten world,"From the moment this album begins you're transported into an ancient world below the jungle canopy. Slow, droning ambient drifts behind tribal drumming like a hot jungle mist. The entire album feels like a journey across a jungle where tribes are playing ritualistic drums, fires are burning, melodies are played out on chromatic percussion, and crystal clear streams lead you down into the mysterious City of Tombs. This is great stuff, highly recommended for fans of Steve Roach's tribal work. The synth work here is very minimal and takes a backseat to the percussion which creates an organic, spacious feel. The rhythms come and go throughout the tracks and are bookended by other types of atmospheric sounds which makes the whole journey feel very animated. If you have even a passing interest in tribal ambient I recommend you check into this one."
1,Old technology for high price,"Mileage Indicator have been very old technology that came in stock (part of the speedometer) to many vehicles all the way back in the 1999. Eg: most of the BMW 3 series. Plus you could help yourself save money for gas by developing a better driving habit (slow down on the acceleration, keep constant speed, etc...) rather than spending extra 150 for this device that only tells you how much gas you are using. Nevertheless, this device would be highly inaccurate for older vehicles anyways since older car inevitably inefficient compare to newer cars, resulting in lower gas mileage. Common sense, think about it. They might make money of from others not so informed buyer but never from me."
4,What software version are these being sold by Amazon?,Quick question. What software version are these being sold by Amazon? I would love to get this if it is one of the latest version.
4,"Easy to use, accurate reading after setup","Pro:Easy to use, Need to setup for correct reading.Con:No decimal point for some setup selections."
2,Just another gadget,"Thought it would be useful but after one day of watching the display bounce around with the numbers, it really isn't very accurate. Even with the cruise control set, the ""miles per gallon"" jumped around so much, you find yourself watching the gauge instead of the road. The other thing that relly sould be noted is that the voltage showed 11.5 volts indicating possibly a dead battery cell. Since my battery was 3 + years old, I figured it was time for a new battery, thanks gauge. Well, before I took the plunge to buy a new battery, I checked it with my battery load tester and two other volt meters. The result was 13.2 volts on the volt meters and the battery passed the load test just fine. Therefore the ScanGauge II got the AXE (sent back). Most of the info on the gauge is a duplicate of what is already available on the vehicle, and the accuracy is questionable."
3,okay,"Bought for 2001 F250 Ford 7.3 diesel. About half of the gauges I programmed into it won't work on my truck, no sensors on a stock engine. A lot of the gauges do work though. As for scan the codes, didn't work for the enhansed codes. I do use it for a gauge and a fuel mpg, works goood for this. There is a lot better scan code readers out there if that is what you are looking for. I think this would do okay on gas engines, I haven't tried for this."
4,Scangauge does what I needed,"I needed this gauge to read my voltage and coolant temp. and it does it fine. The readout is a little small and hard to read under some face colors. I use a white background and that seems to work. If I match it to my dash color, it's hard to read quickly."
5,Worth The Money,"Great product!! I'm going to make it pay for itself by checking and clearing the ""Check Engine"" lights for my friends (for a fee). Down side is that installation brackets are not included or even offered. The manufacturer expects everybody to use hook and loop tape."
4,ScanGuage III,"This product is pretty nice. It's super easy to hook up, and fairly easy to configure. Most people will probably just get one or two settings setup and then not fool with it, though. I like how you can change the screen color to match the color of your instrument displays.My major complaints about this product are:1) No text for ODB trouble codes2) No text for engine display data3) No way to set the time frame for the mileage calculator (it has several settings - instantaneous, trip, day, etc..., but you can't make your own)All in all, this is an excellent product, and will definitely change the way you drive. Without the information provided by scan guage, you won't really know what your mileage is, or how to improve it.I recommend this product, even though it has some shortcomings."
4,ScanGauge for 2000 7.3 Powerstroke,"I like all of the great features. I do have trouble staying connected to my truck. I have tried forcing PWM mode as book says to do, but does not work to stay connected. I think even with the slight bugs it is worth the money. A lot better than a bunch of analog gauges all over the truck for non critical parameters."
5,Work as advertised,"Works ok. Wish I had a better place to mount it. My dash is mostly curves and angles. At first I had trouble getting it to connect with either of my cars. The problem seems to be dirty or corroded OBD plug pins. Cleaned them off with contact cleaner and coated them with dielectric grease and it is working. Now if I can figure out how to adjust the nut behind the wheel, and scrape some of the lead off my right foot."
5,AMAZING!,"Scangauge is amazing! simply put, using it for a week and a half my mileage avg has gone up almost 10 MPG!, I drive a 2008 Honda Fit Sport, I was getting around 36MPG prior to scangauge, my current tank I am getting 45.7! and today I am up to 51MPG! using the scangauge to learn how to drive your car to get AMAZING mileage is really easy! I know it will pay for itself in time! a must have for people interested in cutting fuel costs!"
5,Book Reading,Found it to be an excellent book to give to the grandchildren to help answer their questions and curiosity of where things came from.
4,Interesting.....Great Conversation Piece,"Great for bedtime reading........full of interesting facts. Panati does a great job. When relatives stay, they love to read it. Check it out! I recommend it."
4,It answered a few of my daughter's 'WHY' questions.,"Step by step explanation how many of the things from the past came to be. It sits on the bookcase with it's dogged eared pages, ready to be used again and again for what ever information one of the family would like to know. Be it about an everyday items in the house, something heard on the TV, read in the newspaper or a book. This book hasn't missed. (Makes me wonder what will be in the second version.)"
3,Okay,"I wanted glass which is hard to find The product is listed as vinyl in the description which is nice, many others do not wish others were labeled acrylic, glass, vinyl clearly."
2,High Apple Crystal paperweight/Figurine,The top of the apple crystal is flat. It is almost like the top of the apple was chopped off. It made the stem look out of place. I just did not found that attractive.
4,'gotta love her,"I think this was a great return to what Diana does best, classic, proven music. She does very well here."
5,why aren't volume 1 & 2 released as a double album?,why aren't volume 1 & 2 released as a double-cd album?they both are great!! JB
2,"if you gotta read it, at least get a cheap copy","the overused plot device of a woman in polite society trapped in her loveless sexually repressive marriage who has affairs to ""free"" herself. we see it again in ""the awakening."" if you like french lit, you'll love this. if you don't like introspective womany novels, you won't."
5,THE GREATEST NOVEL EVER WRITTEN. PERIOD.,"It's all here. All of it. I still can't believe it. ALL questions relevant to human existence are addressed through NARRATIVE, not through Big Talk about Big Ideas. Flaubert respects silence. More writers should learn this trick. (One for the geeks: anti-framing device pre-dates ""Modernism"" by fifty-ish years AND has emotional resonance. Amazing!"
3,could be better,"update the animation,or just get rid of it and show only the board,letter and wheel. other than that it is a good game"
4,fun game,This is set up much like the TV version. It's fun to play and the animation is great. It arrived quickly. I'm glad I got it.
4,Keep an open mind,"well.....my comment is...even if its a total fiction of author's thought/imagination, he's a philosopher. I don't mind if all he said was fake but it do help in soothing one's mind, and helping those who is near/facing death.I wonder why those who hate the author so much read his book..and I wonder why are there much less rejections against Tibetan Book of Living and Dying."
4,Eternal Life!,"When I was 14 years old, I had what is called a ""spontaneous mystical experience,"" which put me in direct contact with the eternality of my soul. I have never forgotten that experience, and what it taught me about ""death"" -- the fact that there is no real death. We are, in every sense of the word, eternal beings. Ever since that experience, I have tried to put it into words, and many authors have helped me do just that. But this last addition to the Conversations With God series is, by far, the most detailed and eloquent expression of what it means to live eternally. Thank you, Neale, for helping us understand more about the meaning of life, by understanding more about the meaning, and purpose, of ""death.""Steven Lane Taylor, author of Row, Row, Row Your Boat: A Guide for Living Life in the Divine Flow"
2,started off believable and became conflicting,This book began believable and very interesting and slowly became unbelievable and startling. It is not for me.
5,Home with God,"The last conversation, a book with too many love on their pages... a continue progress since CWG Trilogy... Wonderful message to whom had choose be the LIGTH before the men... =)"
4,For the novice,Its a good book - but not for the old souls who know about reincarnation and all. Its probably superb reading for those who have just left the christian paradigm. Today anyone with 100 bucks can purchase a past life regression from his/her favorite hypnotherapist - why believe if you can KNOW?
3,An interesting read if the after-life interests you,"Over the years I've read many of Mr. Walsch's books because I found the content to be inspirational or thought-provoking in several ways. I particularly liked ""Conversations with God Book 1"" (CwG Book 1) because it had a profound effect on my spiritual philosophy. In this book Walsch focuses primarily on the after-life, and if that is a serious interest of yours then this would be a good book to read. If not, then I'd recommend considering one of his other titles instead, such as ""Friendship with God""Friendship with God: An Uncommon Dialoguefor example, or CwG Book 1Conversations with God : An Uncommon Dialogue (Book 1), which in my view remains the best work he has ever done."
3,Lucia as she was,"This is not a live performance which the release leads one to believe, but an early stereo studio recording made by Ricordi and released in the US on Mercury in the late fifties early sixties. If nothing else the recording demonstrates the performance style of its day. DiStefano is beyond his prime, and displays his verismo method rather baldly. Bastianini is also out of his element. Scotto, however, is at her youthful best, before she attempted spinto roles that pushed the voice. Yet there are a variety of other ""live"" recordings available that better demonstrate her abilities in this role. In conclusion, this is not an awful performance, but probably not recommended to those other than collectors or Scotto afficiandos."
2,Turning into David Lee Roth?,"I was disappointed with the new CD. It sounds like someone oraganized the recording,the songs and music and Bob Dylan just showed up. I LOVE Bob Dylan, but this was not the Bob I know. I miss the composer/musician/Philosopher Bob. This CD had early Jazz sounding remakes and bigband overtones that is turning him into a David Lee Roth showman. If this is the real Bob Dylan, he has really grown up."
4,Another Bob Dylan Album,"This has some good songs on it, and it's worth buying if you're a real Dylan fan. However, for most people, I'd say that you'd do better to listen to Highway 61 Revisited a few more times than go out and buy this CD. It's a good album, but it's nothing compared to Dylan's classic albums. The truth is, Dylan's albums after Blood on the Tracks have mostly been superfluous. The fact that this is one of the best albums of the year says more about how decrepit today's music industry is than it says about the quality of this album"
2,Look elsewhere,"This Cd just shows again that ""Time out of mind"" was the exeption in his Bobness' decay and complete irrelevance since 1985. I have not been able to listen to one of the songs here from beginning to end. It's a full headache of complete lack of originality. The man was always unexpected and even in the past he did real bad records. I can forgive this man for anything, after all he wrote ""Lay lady Lay"", ""Sad Eyed lady of the lowlands"". ""Visions of Johanna"" and another 100 masterpieces. He's still the best songwriter ever, but this cd is only for completists.For the others, at least listen to this cd before buying it. (...)"
3,"Good, But Not Classic Dylan","I'd expected more from this album. Not that it's bad, in any sense of the word. Two tracks are absolutely amazing: ""High Water (for Charlie Patton)"" and ""Mississippi"", the latter almost a ""Blood On The Tracks"" outtake in terms of sound. And ""High Water"" is every bit the equal of ""Blind Willie McTell."" His band is excellent, and Lanois' production is tight without being poppy. The drawbacks: first, Bob's voice is getting very shot, and his diction is making it hard to pick out a lot of lyrics. Second, he's indulged in some schmaltzy, Hoagie Carmichael-ish songs here that just don't work (for me). They remind me of the ""Self Portrait"" album, to be honest. It's not just the 'feel' of the songs -- I can deal with that -- it's the banality of the lyrics, and the poor rhyming and meter of them, too. So, two or three duds, two classics, and a bunch of regular material that will 'grow on you', if you give it a chance."
5,Excellent album,"This album reminds me of ""New Morning"" with its diversity of musical styles, but it is a lot better than ""New Morning"" in terms of musical performances, lyrics and strength of songs. It is in the top 10 of Bob Dylan's albums in his career. It is not as good as ""Freewheelin'"", ""Blonde on Blonde"", ""Highway 61 Revisted"" and perhaps a few others, but then again almost nothing in the history of rock or pop are as good as those albums. It is the best album which Bob Dylan has released since 1974."
3,I like the first three songs!,"The Romantics was one of the many hair bands of my generation in the 1980s. They were popular with their videos like ""One in a Million,"" and ""I hear you talking in your sleep."" The songs are still played on the radio but MTV no longer plays the videos like they used too. Not even VH-1! So, we have the compact disc collections out there. I bought this one because I liked some of their songs but I could give and take the other ones. They were a good group and I wonder if they are still around."
3,Gunfighters/Gun & The Pulpit,This is general western genre sit-down-and-in-the-evening-and-relax type of dvd. Not a classic nor is it a superb movie. The Seller was good to work with.
5,De mucha ayuda,Si manejas diversos tipos de memorias es muy util y versatil. me permite bajar las fotografias de mi camara rapidamente a mi pc.
3,Martin Solveig - Everybody,"Well, I suppose it's my own fault that Martin Solveig's single EVERYBODY reminds me of the Ruffneck classic ""Everybody Be Somebody,"" albeit with more funk guitars. The comparison shouldn't be taken negatively, however. Solveig's own track has enough personality, particularly with the catchy verses provided by Lee Fields. Pete Heller gives the track a deeper rub. The b-side, ""Destiny,"" goes for more of a full-on disco sound, but it doesn't have the punchiness of ""Everybody."" (Be somebody!)"
3,Good Content but Diffiult to Hear,"I love the meditations and fruits of the mysteries on this CD, but it is difficult to hear at least half of the priests, due to either the quietness of their voices or poor quality sound recording. I always have to adjust my speakers as well as increase the volume in order to actually hear the words. On one of the mysteries (I think it's the last one), in the middle of it I actually have to do even more adjusting because it keeps getting lower and lower in volume.So I recommend this CD for it's content, but only if you don't mind fiddling with your stereo knobs a lot so that you can hear what's being said."
4,More Readable than Valis trilogy,'Albemuth' is definitely easier to read than the other books of the VALIS trilogy. It's more of a traditional story than one written around philosophical ideas. Reading it helped me understand Dick's idea of VALIS more completely.
4,well a very strange and cruel movie,i love it i didn't understand everything because there are no subtitleand we don't know what happens to the men who disappears some scenes are very disturbing very goosd one but be careful it is not for children
2,m:robe MR 500i,"The fact that the m:robe can only be managed by one computer is very inconvenient. I got mine as a present with some pictures and tracks already recorded. I had to delete them all to be able to use the m:robe on my own PC.Also, battery life is nowhere near 8 hours, it's around 3-4 hours on mine."
4,From the Producers of Space Ghost Coast to Coast,"This is the soundtrack to a TV special called ""Brak Presents The Brak Show Starring Brak"". Brak was a character on Space Ghost Coast to Coast. He is known for his extreme stupidity. On this album, he sings a bunch of silly, moronic songs, which are actually rather funny. He has several special guests helping him out, including cartoon characters Zorak, Grape Ape and Wally Gator. Some real people guest star too, including Irish folk music group the Chieftains, actor Freddie Prinze Jr. and wrestler Diamond Dallas Page. It you likedSpace Ghost Coast to Coast, you will probably enjoy this CD. If you never saw that show, you will most likely be baffled by this CD."
5,Back in Brak,"This Brak album, along with the other two Space Ghost albums, contain some of the best music ever conceived in the universe. The songs are funny, musically well constructed, instrumentally smart, and in general very well done. I hope they continue."
5,Brak makes my day,"The simple absurdity of so many of the songs on this album is its genius. No matter how bad your day is going, songs like ""I'm a Cucumber"" and ""I've Got You Under My Drawers"" will instantly cheer you up."
1,Chipmunks are still running the place,"I had tried the smaller version of this trap and found that it worked great for catching mice and voles, so I assumed the larger version of the trap would eliminate our chipmunk infestation problem. Unfortunately, the chipmunks could lick the bait off this trap without difficulty. Day after day we found our bait stolen, yet the trap was not snapped. We used peanut butter and bird seed. Maybe something else would work better."
4,Book required for class,worth the read. it was required for class. Worth reading. I learned a lot from this book. cheap and reasonable price.
5,3 Cheers for March!,"He's done it again! For those of you who thought March just couldn't get any better, take a look at the new edition. With my first use, it's already saved me the meager purchase price in time and energy. The references are stupendous and the chemistry looks so much better than the previous version. 3 Cheers for March!"
5,My third Taha album,"My first experience with Taha was when I found Ole Ole while browsing the International section at a CD store. Never heard of him before, but loved the album. I'm always looking for different world beat music.So then I bought Diwan. Hated it. Too traditional for me, I guess. Never could listen to the whole album. It easily made the first cut when dumping CDs on an unsuspecting music dealer.Wasn't sure which direction Medina would go, but the comments on the album cover sounded encouraging. Love it. Better than Ole Ole...."
5,From JazzReview.com,"These guys come flying out of the gate, and they don't stop until the finish line. Constant interaction, mood swings, and surprises galore make this recording a thrill a minute.John Marcus - JazzReview.com"
5,"Incisive, precise, haunting","I had the pleasure of seeing the St Lawrence perform the 3rd quartet and went out and bought this CD immediately after. It did not disappoint. In fact the 8th is the best interpretation I have heard so far of this disturbing, enigmatic work. Forget that this is the ""Shostokovitch"" year - you will not regret owning this CD - each time I listen to it, the more I hear.Wonderful.Tony Warren"
5,The Greatest Book I Have Ever Read,"This was indeed the best book I've ever read. It gave interesting descriptions of savage native life and of life at sea during the time. Ahab was a perfect portrayal of a man blinded by revenge. He will go to any price to get it, and the price he pays...well, that would reveal the ending. Bildad was the religious old man most people think of when they think of the times. Peleg was the swearing contradiction of Bildad. I definitely think you should read this book. It was very interesting and fun to read."
4,moby dick,"A book everyone should read, however, I read a lot and found this book to be one of the most difficult books I have ever read. It took me about 3 months to get through it, but was worth it."
1,Awful,"Moby Dick is the most BORING book I have ever read! I think if you made it into a short comic strip, you would have liked it. But this 550 page account called a novel? No way, man. I implore you, do NOT read this book. If it's required, then do so. But if you have other options, turn to those. We were given a list of books in English class, and I chose to read this. After a week, I was just in page 103. It was needed the next day, so I panicked and switched books, and bought War and Peace. And I finished that book in 8 hours of straight reading."
1,Inadequate notes!,"I've read Moby Dick several times. I started trying to read this edition, and by Chapter 20 I switched to the Oxford edition. I've found the best way to read the book is with a heavily annotated edition, because of the amounts of reference on the surface of and buried beneath the text. This Penguin edition is so lightly annotated that it's useless. If you are a casual reader, the notes won't begin to address all the questions you will have. If you are a more serious student of the work, the notes too lightly address things that any search of the Wiki can explain FAR better."
3,A Tough Classic to Read,"I enjoyed this book in retrospect but it was not an easy book to read. I would really rate it at 3.5 stars and in reading the other reviews posted, I also note that it is certainly not a book for every one. The book is heavily segmented in short, bursty chapters that shift from one subject to another like a worn out party drunk who can't finish a thought or make a continuous series of points. The story really doesn't flow as it is constantly interrupted by Melville's soliloquies on history, art, culture, and philosophy. However, there is a mosaic effect to the work that is only gained in retrospect, which is actually quite impressive. Overall, the book is definitely worth reading, but expect to either appreciate it after you've read it or not to like it at all."
2,Classic or not...,"Times have changed. As an ex-literature major, I never read this book. So, I ordered it, but, alas, I find that I don't have the patience anymore to read such long narratives, using older English. I decided to bag it and chalk it up to an unread classic."
5,Essential dark literature,"Herman Melville's ""Moby Dick"" is a rich, stirring tale of courage, loyalty, revenge and adventure, told with a great deal of irreverence and dark humour. Captain Ahab is one of the most endearing of literary creations, the peg-legged skipper hell-bent on punishing the whale that cost him a limb. The mighty prose shows Melville to have been deeply influenced by Shakespeare, and in some passages, his love of Shakespeare elevates him to heights of emulation. Never has blank verse resounded more potently in a prose-work!"
4,Moby Dick,"Moby Dick by Herman Melville is a captivating book that takes you on a thrilling journey as you follow a sailor by the name of Ishmael who is a sailor on Pequod, a whaling vessel. The ship is commanded by Ahab who is determined to kill Moby Dick, the whale that took away one of his legs. This book picks up momentum as you getter farther into it, building up anticipation until it is almost too much to tolerate. This book is well written and is one that I would recommend."
3,Make up your frickin mind!,"Holy Jehovah's witness Batman, what is this? A book with two titles? I refuse to buy any book that is published in which they have two titles they are arguing over. So what is it going to be peoples, Moby Dick or The Whale? Most people nowadays don't know moby dick from moby the singer, so in the end it does not really matter now does it peoples? I love Whales I do not think we should kill them at all but love them and the beauty they have. I tire of Sharks though they are bullies and need to be slapped silly.So flip a coin, choose a title and then publish it."
2,Moby Dick,Moby Dick is a very hard book to read for the average person. With long sentences and complex vocabulary it is hard to understand. The story is a little disturbing on what a man by the name of Ahab tries to do to seek its revenge.
1,bad narration,"If you care at all about this vital novel, don't purchase the audiocassette version of Moby Dick read by Burt Reynolds. I could hardly bear it after listening to the first tape. Reynolds' accents--often what come across as drunken rants--are sometimes impossible to understand, and he makes Ishmael sound like a silly old salt o' the sea. A great work brought low."
3,Inflated Melville,"I am one of those who firmly believes that Melville's non-fiction is superior to his fiction. ""Typee"" and ""Omoo"" are more to my taste. ""Moby Dick"" contains any number of memorable characters, scenes and philosohpical speculations, but, unconfined by the autobiographical incidents that formed his early work, Melville's mind and his syntax here ramble all over the place. It's interesting to note that this novel was resurrected from obscurity by Hollywood in the 1920's when it was adapted as a vehicle for John Barrymore."
3,Verbose to the extreme,"Too much detail and not enough storyline. Would recommend this to people that can't get enough homework. It was not an enjoyable book, it took real effort to finish."
2,"Great story line, so-so novel","I know, people are forever saying that Moby Dick is one of the greatest novels ever written, well it isn't. The story is fantastic but the book itself can be so boring that you end up skimming through chapters. Give me a break, how many chapters should be devoted to the differences between the types of whales? It is an old classic though and prior to Hemmingway many writers, not all, devoted a multitude of pages describing minutia but Melville goes beyond that. He is like Dickens. I'm really happy that I saw the movie which is devoted to the story line and not the book. If you are considering Moby Dick I suggest you put the book on your shelf to impress your friend and buy the movie for your enjoyment."
1,BUYER BEWARE!,"I have no idea how good this product is because when it arrived, the cd-rom was missing. Amazon is always good about dealing with such issues, but they've run out of stock on this item. There is another review here with a similar ""missing"" software issue. I'm a little freaked out about what to do next. The Amazon cardboard box was intact, it's the retail box that had the issue. This means Amazon has a problem at their warehouse, or the theft must be taking place at the software maker's warehouse and Amazon is neglectful about checking the seal. Either case, this is a really lame situation. I'd suggest walking into a brick and mortar store. Buy the software in your hand, sealed box, etc."
3,Ultimately disappointed...,"This book should be called the Reiki Masters Ultimate Guide. This book does not give any information on hand positions or administering self Reiki. It's all about attunements, which is no good unless you are a Reiki Master. Level I and II's, look elsewhere."
4,Unique reiki book to show the symbols and how to give attunements.,"I've read other reiki books prior to reading this book, and found this book to be not single handedly enough to give guidance for beginners. Basic information is pretty much the same as other reiki books, but this shows the symbols as the title says. Big part of this book is to show you how to give attunements to others, step by step pictures. Some part contains the information how to contact spirit and the loved ones that crossed over, and some reiki secrets. It does not show detailed hand positions to give reiki like other books that I read, so this guide may not be for the complete beginner. I think you should have this book as a reference for your reiki book library, and have other books that shows how to give reiki with detailed hand positions, such as Penelope Quest's ""Reiki for Life""."
4,CD/video attunements,"Yes, the book is very good - but I must take issue with Kathleen's comments about receiving a Master attunement via video. This can be very dangerous and, to my mind, negates the ideals of Reiki. The whole point of having an attunement via a Master is to develop a relationship with a)infinite and healing energy and b) your Reiki Master. I have know of a few people who have become attuned in this way when they were simply not ready. They found the experience disturbing, even frightening. Please, take Reiki seriously."
5,A Godesend,"Steve Murray's Reiki VOL 1,2,3 and Reiki False Beliefs and Attunement DVD's are nothing short of a miracle. They have helped me in my life and personal endeavors - more than I can say. I really wanted to become a Reiki Master and did not have the money to do so. Steve's products have made it possible for me to become one. His attunement DVD's really work and his Healing attunement DVD is a must buy. It really works. I wholeheartedly reccommend these books and DVD's to anyone wanting to heal themselves or anyone wanting to become a Reiki healer. His Reiki books are full of information that gives you the confidence to become a Reiki healer and help others to heal through Reiki. I am so grateful to Steve Murray for making Reiki available to anyone who is seeking this path of healing and career."
5,Reiki The Ultimate Guide. By Steve Murray.,"I would like to say, that this book is really amazing. I am happy that I found it. I just became a Reiki Master in December of 2003. And I have been practicing Reiki a lot. And I did the Initiations already. But I found out that this book has so much Information that I don't know yet. I would really recommend this Book to everyone who is Interested in Natural Healings. Or even to people who never had experience with Reiki. Its a great new Journey of your Life. Reiki has changed my Life a lot. And it will change yours too. I want to thank Steve for his wounderful work, writing this book.Lana G. Reiki-Master."
4,Figaro,This bracelet has appeal also the appearence that tells others that the figaro style maybe what you're in search of! So if considerin' a bracelet that isn't too big but very noticable you might want this!!
3,Christian Missionary Looks at Islam pre-1905,"This book is issued jointly by a number of the Missionary Societies in Great Britain for the use of Missionary Study Circles. The author has tried to take a balanced view and looks at: 1-The Extent of Islam; 2-Whence it Came; 3-How Came It;4-What it is; 5-How it Works; 6-How Save it - past, present and future. There is also a chronological table and bibliography. The book contains a large number of black and white photographic illustrations and a map of the Mohammedan world at the end of the book. Published in 1909, first edition. In green boards with white titling the book measures approx. 7 1/2"" x 5"" with 367 pages."
4,"Great eclectic mix of jazz, folk, and pop","I've been listening to Dan's music over again since his death. While this CD never got a lot of play before, I just realized what I had been missing.""Twin Sons"" is a mix of instrumentals with a strong feeling of place and time and vocal music with Dan Fogelberg on the primary lead. The instrumentals (songs 1-4,6,7,8) of are lovely and a departure from Fogelberg's heartfelt vocals on the latter numbers.I still prefer the songs where Fogelberg sings: ""Tell Me to My Face"", ""Since you asked"" and ""The Power of Gold"". Even if you don't like the instrumentals, these three songs make the CD price worth it because they are some of Fogelberg's best work.Rebecca Kyle, May 2008"
1,Grisham is safe,"I look out for every new legal thriller...it is my favorite genre. I read ""Mahogany Row"" & I will tell you this....John Grisham can rest easy. This is one book that you may judge by it's poorly designed cover. The story is like something you'd see as a movie of the week on some obscure television station...but bad. What the book lacks in content it makes up for in...pages....with words. What troubles me is that despite the quality of this book, somehow I felt that the author is actually a very intelligent person. Keeley shouldn't give up writing....he should just learn more about it. I think I will give him another chance on his 3rd or 4th book."
1,I don't understand....,"I'd seen magazine articles that featured Katie Brown's own homes, which are designed with a creative mix of antiques and modern pieces and somehow manage to look both edgy and cozy. But, this book was really disappointing. Full of ideas that are overly trendy and that I would quickly tire of, if I even liked any of them enough to attempt them. Somehow her personal style is not translating well to her books. Is her publisher encouraging her to aim for a less sophisticated look?"
2,A Katie Brown Letdown,"As a huge Katie Brown fan, I was disappointed with this book. As a truly eclectic decorator, I am open to any possible source for design...scrap yard, junk yard, garden, etc. But, come on, a coffee table with a base made of coiled up garden hoses? A hard-cast clay sandcastle? Not to be totally negative, a few crafts, and that's what this book majors in, are cool. The corseted pillow, for instance, or the bright lights, big city illuminated table. This book is a good choice for newlyweds or students, first-time apartment dwellers on tight budgets. And for truly hip urban cats, I would recommend Pad: The Guide to Ultra Living. If we could give half marks, I would give this book two and a half stars for effort. Save this book for a library check-out item and not as your decorating guide."
2,Green Kennari Ghosts in Kayah,"Interesting story and easy to read but it is not clear how much of the narrative is autobiography and how much is fiction. The style is somewhat self-indulging and perhaps also a bit prosaic, even the description of the skirmishes between the burmese army and the dissidents/rebels, but perhaps reality is more mundane than fiction! (My mother was born less than a hundred miles from where the author was born)"
4,no problems here,"Our kids love it! We've had it for a year. I find the cover to be a little too thick to get all of the cooling through, but it makes the kids happy and seems to help them. I haven't used it for warming as of yet. I did find the cover difficult to put on when frozen so once I got it on, I left the cover on. It lives in our freezer, ready for boo-boos."
1,great music -terrible editing,"I strongly support the 3-star review. This set is not the good source to listen to these broadcasts. Orrin Keepnews has deleted many announcement bits, but what is worst, many announcement bits where Bird played behind Symphony Sid.All of this to include the 1947 Carnegie Hall concert, which is in plenty of other issues, and four 1950 tracks which don't represent the complete session, just arbitrarily the small segment acquired by Savoy in the 1970s. The complete 1950 session is also to be found somewhere else.The Japanese version of the Royal Roost material is fine but hard to get. A new one in a 4CD box devoted exclusively to the complete Royal Roost performances and including various truly appropriate bonus sessions surpasses it and has just recently appeared in Europe."
4,My review,This book is full of facts of the Korean War. It would be a good first book for someone interested in the Korean War. A plus for the book (in my opinion) was that one of the co-authors was an infantry officer that fought there during the conflict.
5,Best Korean War Overview!,"Having been to Korea and having read a great deal on the subject of this nearly forgotten conflict, I didn't expect much from Fire and Ice. Boy, was I ever wrong! The book is crisp, fast reading and chock full of content. Provides a great read for the expert or the the novice. Lot's of hard to find information makes this a must reference book on the subject. It's all here: on air, land and sea. Units, weapons and tactics of both sides and our UN Allies. Then there is the fun stuff like the review of Korean War flicks. This is the best book I have found on Amazon! Enjoy..."
2,"Some Old & Low Quality Recordings, Some Good","I bought this CD in a Music Store and have downloaded the Cover Image. Unlike the Amazon description, this is a Single CD package, with music selections agreeing with what Amazon shows as Disc 1.The performers names are well known and respected, but some of the recordings are low grade from the era before high quality. They are old recordings, early versions of some of their best.Exceptions to this are ""Please Don't Talk About Me When I'm Gone"", ""Jersey Bounce"", and ""Woodchopper's Ball"", which are not too shabby in quality and energy. Dorsey's ""Tiger Rag"" is also not bad, but not of the greatest recording quality.""Chatanooga Choo Choo"" is the standard Miller hit which is available anywhere with better quality. This version has no singing or voice... just the instrumental.You'll have to pick and choose the selections you really like."
4,Mariner Comfort,This bracelet was bought by me to match another that I have as a result this item proved to wear very comfortable and the 7.9 grams compliment this item as well. So if you're lookin' for a bracelet that isn't too big or have that phoney appearence then this is for you!
1,Pathetic,I Bought this cd beacause there first cd right back was great.Theres one good song on this cd the rest suck.Right back was nice and fresh almost like sublime this one soundstotally diffrent its offspring meets britney spears meets sublime there vocals are okay but music wise they sucked on this cd.
2,No Georgian script? Whaaaat?!,"Here's a novel idea: publish a book that is romanized instead of using the script in the country. How are you going to be able to read signs and such? Well, good luck, partner!!!"
4,Very usefull for traveling - not for study,"It's a usefull book if you are going there fore a shorther period and just need to use the most common phrases, but for studying the language its of no use since the georgian letters is left out- but as i said this makes it a good travelcompanian for a shorter visit!"
2,Classic King Cole Polished,Diana Krall has taken the smooth jazz of Nat Kng Cole and made it even better...her renditions are polihed and perky. She is a great modern jazz singer/pianist who should be heard and seen more often!!!!!
4,"Run, walk or Krall to your Cd player!",Very nice cd. Excellent sound quality. Part of my dinner party collection by the way...
3,Not for a narrow foot,I bought these skates for my twins for basic and beginner ice skating. I do think they run true to size. They are high quality and are a good price. I do think they are very snug for a child that has a wide foot. I would not recommend these skates for someone with a wide foot at all. One of my twins has an average foot and they were a bit uncomfortable for her. The other twin has a wide foot and she was very uncomfortable in them. Fortunately we only had few lessons in these and then outgrew them in 2 months. The next skate we bought were Jackson skates which are much wider skates and were the same price.
2,"OK for DECT, poor display and Caller ID","I got one at the local Circuit City, as the only DECT phone w/o an answering machine I could find.I agree with other reviewers: this is a marginal phone. The LCD blue-on-blue is very hard to read from a distance or an angle. The phone works fine, but the Caller ID on the remote handsets is very unreliable. It displays ""INCOMPLETE DATA"" about 70% of the time. I called tech support, getting the usual clueless Indian who worked from a script. I tried resetting the phones by disconnecting the battery, returning to factory defaults, and disconnected every other phone. Same result.Sorry, Circuit City, this one goes back; Caller ID and readability are too important to me. I should have come to Amazon first and read the reviews!"
5,Solid!,"Classic rock is a much abused term, but if ever a recent album deserved the title, it's this one. Strong melodies, driving rhythms, catchy riffs that cry out for your air guitar, crisp lyrics and a range of grooves from slow ballads to catchy up tempo rockers. You can't go wrong with this one. Recommendation: It's not called Highway Companion for nothing - slip it in the car stereo, find yourself an open road, blast the music and take off!"
3,not the CD I thought it was,"Thought it had more familiar music on it, but arrived timely in good condition."
2,Actually 2 1/2 stars,"This is rehashed music. It's as if Petty needed to record to make some money. Many of the songs are very similar to earlier releases. Some of the riffs are similar. I guess there's nothing wrong with that. But, it's more of a different version of an earlier song. Jeff Lynne's contribution is as expected. He puts in the fillers and keeps the songs linked together. There's not much here though. I love Petty. To me, the last two releases have fallen a bit short. I bought both. Couldn't resist ever buying a Petty release. The production of Jeff Lynne had me anticipating greatness. But, there is no greatness here. Unfortunately"
3,Tired Petty,"Considering that Tom took a four year break in between albums, this is a pretty big disappointment. The three best songs are the first three, and Square One was already released on the Elizabethtown soundtrack...so he basically had to borrow a previously released song in order to improve the quality of this album.Saving Grace is great Petty, but after that and Flirting With Time, it's mostly slow, most of the time. Dragging, seemingly uninspired tunes that show an aging rock star who forgot how to rock. Full Moon Fever is and will always be his best and with Jeff Lynne on board again, one would think that would be replicated to some extent. Unfortunately, that is not the case and most of the songs are forgettable...which is difficult to say for Tom Petty's work."
3,Not your Refugee,"Highway Companion shows Tom's ""southern"" side i.e, toned down from his 80's tunes. For those that loved his 80's brand of music, you may be disapointed as I was. Having said that, he is a versatile artist and that attracts a wider audience. I tend be stuck in the 80's style of music and I may very well lack versatility in my taste in music. I was totally blown away from seeing him on YouTube doing the George Harrison tribute of ""My Guitar Gently Weeps"" - a very heartfelt song that he nails with his vocals. If you're a diehard Petty fan, then add this to your list."
3,This Righteous Rocker Can Surely Do Better,"HIGHWAY COMPANION is Tom Petty's third album without the Heartbreakers, the other musicians being Jeff Lynne and Heartbreakers guitarist Mike Campbell. I wish I could say that Petty's belief that the young Australian tourist jailed in Indonesia since May 2005 on drug-smuggling charges was unjustly convicted makes this album worth buying, but even his strong advocacy of sanctions against Indonesia, unfortunately, can't save an album that only has four good songs on it. The ZZ Top-style opener, ""Saving Grace"", is great, as are a couple of other cuts, but the fact that Petty has put out two mediocre-to-bad albums in a row seems to arouse suspicions that working with the same people for too long has caused him to run out of gas. It would be good for Petty to get together with Dickey Betts and/or Gregg Allman to write and produce his next album. Maybe then we'll get an album worthy of a great artist who's also a great human being."
2,wild guess,"anyone think the wife poisoned the main character? reread the email interlude after the ""First Tests"" chapter. no smoking gun, but that, combined with her ""it's all my fault"" at the end of the book and the anytus story makes me wonder. the parallel being, someone tried to kill someone else but it got botched, and now that person has to live with the aftermath.this expanation is certainly not water tight and i don't know even if it's the truth, why write such a story.i don't think this book is worth a lot of analysis. while there are interesting, resonant perspectives now and then, i don't know that there's enough to hold it together as a book. or maybe it's a funny joke, a book where everyone's trying to diagnose what's going on, and readers end up doing the same thing--both futilely..."
4,Multiple Narratives and deep meanings,"In response to Tim Appelo's review. - Great Review, just to add:Bill's paralysis: (caused by) (smymptom?)His innability to do anything about his situation, his life, the speed car that got him to where is today.Also: Both Socrates and Bill were put in a ""Cage""...(but an individual's mind can never be caged..)"
3,Fast and furious,"3 1/2Hardcore, sometimes sloppy drum & bass assault ends up, in it's brief time, dazzling with Raczynski's relentlessness. He may lack that pivotal oversight that guides those he attempts to emulate, but often compensates in his youthful zest for electro-destructo."
4,One special song,"this is a sound album (i don't really know how this could have won a grammy for best reggae album, much have been a load of rubbish that year) but is still enjoyable. It was Written is an excellent song and charges up the album nicely, but it is More Justice which provides the true flame. that song i can safely say is my favourite song of the rasta awareness genre ever. the music is such a powerful tune and the message is great! i love the song so much. for the two songs mentioned i am able to up the rating to 4 star but otherwise there isn't too much on offer. i mean how can this win reggae grammy when half the songs aren't even reggae.More Justice is great!!"
2,Mediocre hip-hop reggae,"While some listeners may balk at the number of hip-hop tracks on Halfway Tree, I balk more at the number of MEDIOCRE hip-hop tracks. While there is certainly some fresh, exciting material here, too much on this album seems to get bogged down by a focus on style over substance, just like Ky-mani's sub-par The Journey."
2,I helped make this movie!,"hilarious. I helped make this movie in college. It is truly a no-budget movie. I made most of the corpses and gore stuff with my friend Lance beard. horrifically bad acting, just like the others have said. But I have to say it was fun making it for about 20 grand (i heard). We had a haunted house volunteer production company at the time in college and Eric decided he was going to make a movie using the props we had at the time.Wow, horrible, fun times. The reason we all stayed late in college!klaus larsen"
2,OH! I GET THE PUN NOW,"The title is a pun as a paint brush is used to paint pictures of the victims with their blood. The cheerleaders are never in cheerleader outfits, nor do they ever take a shower. The do parade around in swim suits for a large part of the movie, which held my attention as well as their playing an idiotic game of ""Truth or Dare."" But alas, without a pillow fight, their antics failed to provide the right stimulation. Roger Corman where are you?This movie was incorrectly listed as Science Fiction at my local store (now out of business). Whenever that happens I expect aliens. They never showed up, even during the horribly done flashback scenes which contained some of the worse acting since ""Twilight."" Did you count how many pictures the pervert took before he had to reload his camera? What was that, about 200 pictures?"
1,God Awful,"There's not too much to say. I would rather ""bob for doodies"" in my toilet than watch this garbage again."
3,"If you're looking from Manny from Ice Age,this isn't it!","It's a really great looking plush, big and soft but my son wanted Manny and according to him this isn't Manny."
2,NO WAY!,Don't believe the hype!!!! this is mediocre! Lords of acid will give this lady a nice kick in the...!I dunno how her new album will sound like but this one is just blah!
2,not usuable in a helmet,"I bought this as a cheap mic so I could use the bluetooth phone that is part of the Zumo. It was listed as an accessory for the Zumo, which is marketed as a motorcycle GPS, but this is strictly for using in a car, way to sensitive for in helmet on a windy noisy motorcycle. I purchased a much more expensive J&M mike which picks up nothing that is farther away then about 1/8 inch. Garmin could have said in their write up for it not to be used with motorcycles. I have not tried it in the truck, might make the Zumo mic more sensitive for hands free use then the one built into the cradle that I have to yell at to get it to understand me when using the voice commands on my LG cell phone."
4,Ivana Bolanca is definitely easy on the eyes,"This is (what some would consider) a ""chick flick""--and I wouldn't disagree. I don't ordinarily go for this type of romantic comedy, but the time and setting (mid '90s post-war Belgrade) and the fact the story deals witha couple of refugees trying (in their own way) to get by and find a bit of happiness, some normalcy in their existance, makes it the exception. And, of course, there is the truly gorgeous Ivana Bolanca. The lady is sexy and sweet and charismatic--without ever being in your face about it, unlike so many celebrity females running around out there today who act like they're god's gift to men--and are far from it.I dug this feel-good flick & can only hope that Ivana's career takes off and she continues to do good work."
2,They leak!,"First of all, these are fragile. Drop it and the thin brittle globe will break.But most importantly, the snap on plastic lid leaks and it is on the bottom of the feeder so all the fluid escapes.I tried two of them and they both leaked."
2,Danny flubbed this one.,"Danny can be a great dancefloor DJ, sometimes he has a bad night. This CD is more of a chill-out after-party cool-down record than his usual stuff, but ultimately it's annoying. He tried to pick really esoteric tracks but mostly it's a bunch of crap, boring piano tracks, dumb vocal samples, banal early nineties hits, and one or two great old paradise garage classics. BODY AND SOUL VOL.2 does a much better job taking us back in time, chilling us out, and remaining up-to-date and relevant at the same time. I respect Danny, but I can't listen to this CD."
1,Relativity without equations is worthless,Any equation with a square root or division is display as a really small picture.Resizing the text has no effect on the equations which seem to get smaller later in the book till by 33% I had to give up because even with a magnifing glass the pictures were so light and resolution at that small size so bad that I could not read them at all.A book on Relativity without readable equations makes the book not even worth a penny.
5,Interesting.,"Enjoyed this book, it was not too difficult to read, it is an excellent copy. I would recommend this book to everyone."
2,Poorly OCR'ed copy with no indications of which of the many editions this was copied from,"As I understand it Einstein updated this book many times, but there is nothing that indicates which edition this is. The multiple scanning errors make one suspicious of how closely the text adheres to any of the original editions.I'm returning this one and looking for a real edition."
5,For science curious people w/a slight mathematics background,An interesting and in-depth view of relativity. A slight mathematics background is very helpful with understanding some of the equations. The concept is clear and well articulated. It leaves you wanting a deeper knowledge of physics and Einstein.
1,be careful which copy you buy,"Do not buy the copy of this book with ISBN 978-1452841212 !!! You have been warned! The equations which are set out as images (ie any that require more than simple typesetting) have not been printed, and the text just shows the file name instead eg. eq1.gif. I can't believe that they're selling this book! The other copies are ok from what I have seen on the preview pages."
4,It was good....,"but not the best I have read. It wasn't a ""can't stop....can't put book down"" kinda book. If u agree mail me"
4,A Very Good CD,"Alien Ant Farm is a very good CD. It has a good sound and a good everything else too. It is a good first cd for the band and I think that it will become a very popular band in the future. I was really impressed by smooth criminal. It is a very good song and there are only a few tracks that I skip. The only reason that I didn't give it 5 stars is because I think that it's missing something. Overall, ANThology is very good."
3,Nothing we havn't heard before...,"Alien Ant Farm (AAF) is an immitation off of many bands before it. It is mostly heavy punk rock but nothing we havn't heard before. Sum 41 kicks AAF's sorry A**. But give them a break. This is only their fist CD and they have time to improve. I just hope their next CD has more variety than pretty much one beat throughout the whole thing. Oh and by the way, track 13, Universe, drags on FOREVER! Maybe why it's called UNIERSE!"
3,Average,"I bought this a LONG time ago after I bought Hybrid Theory and was somewhat ignorant. I liked it at the time, but now it's just sort of average. I can't say I like it or dislike it. The singing style sort of annoys me now, and you can't really understand the lyrics anyway. The music is a little too lukewarm for me also. It's not really hard rock how I like it. It's just average music in my opinion that stands with all of the other million bands that somehow made it mainstream."
1,I loved these guys from day one.. let me explain....,"It was a gorgeous day. The sun was dancing in the sky, the birds carried wonderful melodies this morning, it was THAT day. My 7th Birthday Party, and who to my surprise rolled up right after Bobo the clown, a group called Alien Ant Farm. Yep, they played a rocking 8 song set for my 6 and 7 year old buddies. They literally tore it up. They had to stop after a while though because, Billy spilled his Kool Aid on Jeff, and my mommy had to clean it up, but after no time, they were right back into the kicking set. Only one thing kinda bothered me, i did get a little tired of the 8 different rendition of ""Smooth Criminal"". There was the version without drums, the version without guitar, the version where nobody played. But, hey, Im not one for complaining, I know a lot of 6 and 7 year olds who would give anything for AAF to play at their birthday parties. Alien Ant Farm for life."
4,interesting,"i bought this album bc i liked the song movies. its a great song, by the way. the album itself is very intriguing, because i dont like really hard rock, like their opener suggests. as i continued listening, i found that they were alot more than another hard band like incubus or staind. they seemed to explore themselves more, and even reminded me of a hard offspring. anyway, a good album, except for the first song."
2,Painfully bad,"I used to like this album a lot. But I can't stand it now. It's boring and unoriginal. It brings nothing new to radio. The lyrics don't make much sense. The bassist is good, some of the songs are listenable. But is just doesn't appeal to me. Boring, bland, and just bad. Bad, boring, corporate rock. No. No."
5,Sleek and Classy,"I'm a huge fan of Adidas shoes in general, so this review may seemed biased. However, of all the pairs of shoes I own, these are my favorite. They're sleek, comfortable, airy, and true to size. Great for everyday use, but I wouldn't buy them for any sport activity as some of the reviewers have."
1,What Are Those Soles Made Of?,The soles are actually slippery. More like plastic than rubber. Fails the most basic of tests for a sneaker.
3,Not too too bad,"It's ironic that the best track on Brain Mcknight's latest release turns out to be a duet with N'Syncer Justin Timberlake. I play it again and again as it out does most of the other work. The title Superhero and the reputation of crooner Brian Mcknight would lead us to believe that the title track would be a beautiful graduation-like triumphant song, but instead we get a lionel ritchie-like cross over rock tune. Overall, Brain Mcknight adds to his collection of good works securing him as one of my favorites none-the-less. I look forward to him doing it again, and even stepping it up a bit."
3,"""When will I see you again?"" is THE song.....","I'm not a McKnight fan. I just wanted to comment on the song""When will I see you again?"". The McKnight and Hammond combination is beautiful and touches on many ideas that peopleare pondering, especially after the terrorist attacks. It's nice to hear someone outside of the gospel music industry singing about things in life that are more eternal.Peace""You shall know them by their fruit....."" selah pause think about that"
5,"Pricey, but worth it.","I have purchased cheaper shirts from Croft and Borrow and they don't stand up close to these shirts. If you are buying to wear as a white t-shirt, and that's all... you probably shouldn't buy this product. I have only used these shirts as under shirts or wearing for mowing the lawn or just around the house. As silly as it sounds during the Michael Jordon commercial, it's true. These shirts don't get the ""bacon"" collar like other brands. If you want the undershirt to last a long time, buy these."
3,A bit sheer,"The shirts are OK. I bought it for my husband as he likes to wear under his work uniform. They are a bit on the thin/sheer side. But if you're just using them as an undershirt, they work just fine."
4,Undershirts - not 'T-Shirts',"Other reviewers have stated their too thin, that's the idea people, if you didn't know you were buying 'undershirts' then you need to do more shopping in physical retail stores. my only reason for 4 stars is the mediums i ordered were a little on the big side after 1 wash, maybe they'll shrink down later and be a little more snug or else I'll grow a beer belly to make these shirts worthy of five stars, do not worry, I'll make this purchase work."
4,"tiny size, loud noise","This arrived quickly and I was surprised at the size. Its really smaller than the picture, but it is funny it has several different phrases that it says when you press it. Its loud and clear, very funny. It came with batteries in it and its ready to go."
1,Not the same item!!!,"The picture shows the button looking like the ""easy"" button from STAPLES. When i got the item it was a totally different item. It was black and looked nothing like the ""easy"" button as advertised. It was a totally different item :-("
1,Cheaply made button,Button breaks really fast. Cheaply made! Would have been great if it had lasted longer!Would have been great if it had been made better.
5,still laughing,I bought this as a gag gift of sorts for my husband. There's been a lot of BS at work as of late and I thought this would be perfect for him! He loved it. Took it to work with him the day after Christmas!!! Money well spent to see him smile!
3,It is ok.,It is ok. Batteries inside were dead.It is a little smaller than I hoped.But it works and will provide a few laughs.
2,Battery problem,"I ordered two of these. One is OK and the other did not work. I opened up the battery cover and found one of the batteries had leaked, coating the contact spring with gunk that would not come off. How ironic... I guess I can push the button on the one that works..."
1,Received different product than ordered in picture,"I have a Bulls**t button, exactly as pictured when I bought the product. However, a different version of the button arrived today and I am very disappointed. It has some different phrases and a different voice than the one I currently have.Don't want to go through the return process but needless to say I will not be purchasing from this Amazon store again unless this is resolved."
1,Not Good,"Order came in on time. When I opened the package it was dirty looked used and was stapled to hold it together. Product did not work, had to send it back."
4,A MUST HAVE FOR EVERY OFFICE SETTING,Perfect for meetings or even when somebody starts talking to you spewing nonsense.Warning - Make sure your boss or superiors have a decent sense of humor. I am not responsible for somebody who gets terminated because they failed to use better judgement on if they are allowed to use this.
3,Funny Button,I gave the button that worked away as a gag gift. The second one had to be returned because it wouldn't work.
4,Un-Gangsta at it's finest,"This is deifinately one of the most solid rap albums I have ever come across. I had just started to become so sick of all the new ""gangsta"" rap that was coming out by artists who seemed like they were just spittin about the streets because it was makin them money. The Pharcyde finally comes through with some UNIQUE topics that vary from your average crap that is starting to make me sick to my stomach. This is a breath of fresh air from an original California based hip-hop crew. Pick this up if you want a solid performance that relies more on original lyrics, vocals, and content, rather than slickly produced, radio friendly beats with words placed over the top of them."
3,So-so,"This book is a mixed bag.The color photos are amazing and the historical stuff great.As a travel guide though it has little on the basics (food, hotel, etc), and pretty crummy maps.Also there are NUMEROUS mistakes in the spelling of Russian things. Clearly whoever DID edit it, didn't bother to check the Russian stuff AT ALL. Like page 61 and obmen valyutOO, and page 65 suggesting women look for bathrooms labeled 'Sch'. The Russian for women is ZHENschina not SCHENschina.The author writes for Russian Life magazine, these sorts of errors are pathetic."
4,Extremely Cool!,"This is like getting dropped into a fantasy world, an instruction manual on their magic or an encyclopedia on their culture or maybe a museum display of their creatures-Fun and Fantasies. George Lucas must have realized, though, that this would eventually bore many people, so he nicely wove it together with a lot of wild action and really dramatic magic; the outcome was a quite wonderful book, and a great chance to slip into another world."
3,Not a bad book but too derivative...,"I enjoyed the movie ""Willow"" and the follow-up book ""Shadow Moon,"" so I eagerly bought ""Shadow Dawn"" when it came out. It wasn't so much a bad book as it was horribly derivative. A major speech late in the book mimics the main speech from ""Braveheart"" nearly point for point. Another character featured in the book - I kid you not - is revealed to be the Lord of the Dance. THE LORD OF THE DANCE. The book came out a bit after the big Michael Flatley/Riverdance craze, so I hardly think it was a coincidence. This uninspired, unoriginal book was a sore disappointment for me after the beginnings of the series.All the same, if you're a fan of Willow and want to find out what happens to Willow/Thorn, Elora and the rest, go ahead and buy it. Just don't say I didn't warn you."
1,Blah!,First one was so bad I couldn't make it far into this one without giving up on the whole story. Claremont's most embarrassing piece of work in my opinion.
5,Masterpiece,THis is definitely their best album. They play atmospheric and melodic metal. The compositions are all perfect and the tracks are all so catchy. I like this album from the start to the end. Just buy this cd - Its perfect.A definitely 5 star (o live it) album.
2,Hard to set up,"I still have not gotten it to work with my CD player, tape deck, turntable or speakers. Not easy to set up."
4,Simple but effiient.,This receiver doesn't have all the bells and whistles but it has everything I need. It is good quality at an affordable price.
1,Junk,Initially the receiver was unable to retain preset FM stations in memory. Later it began to loose volume until no sound sources could be heard from the receiver. I exchanged the unit for anther brand that has worked very well.
3,not for the power hungry,"Don't get me wrong, this is a very clean amp! If you love mid and high sound !The amp does not have the power reserve to give you good low end sound !But like i said,it is very clean sounding !If you are into old school 2 channelsound as myself,with vintage high end speakers this is not the receiver!If you are just wanting to set up a decent bedroom stereo, then yes it will work great,as long as you budget a powered sub-woofer into your purchase!If you want true power of 100 watts a side, check out the Yamaha RX-797,And it's even cleaner than the Sherwood!Drawback is it is a lot more expensive, but worth it if you have quality speakers!"
1,Bad,"I went crazy when I heard Powerman 5000 had an ENTIRE ALBUM that was unreleased. Rather than waste money buying it, I downloaded the album.It was a major waste of disk space.The intro track was boring, not like the intro tracks for Tonight the Stars Revolt! or Transform which had important things to say.Danger is Go! was the only track I liked, probably Bombshell too, but Bombshell gets boring quickly and Danger is Go! followed the same fate.Spider One is remarkably brilliant for choosing to withold this album from public ears."
3,the unreleased powerman cd,"this cd never came out and i downloaded it off [website] and songs i enjoy are Bombshell,Tomorrow Is Yesterday,Danger Is Go,and Wake Up. some little interludes pop up too and some odd tracks such as Megatronic. i can see why Spider didn't want to release it, it seems rushed and its only like 33 minutes long. i hope this sees the light of day though with some newer songs too coz this is just too short. a recommended download."
3,YOU HAVE TO HEAR IT TO BELIEVE IT,I JUST GOT THIS CD AND I MUST ADMIT IT IS FAR DIFFERENT THE AN EARLIER ALBUM I HAVE OF THEIRS ON VINYL CALLED 'ONE MORE TIME' MCA-346. THIS IS AN ALBUM TO HEAR WHEN IN A COFFEE SHOP--ON THE ACOUSTIC/FOLK SIDE. A NICE ALBUM.
1,Appalling...,"This is appalling, the models are terrible, the animation amateurish, and the texturing ugly (horrible misuse of procedural textures). Avoid if you can, there are many fine books on Max, this is NOT one of them."
1,Terrible,"When i saw the firt pictures of this book, I was totaly chocked.. After 2 years using 3ds max, I was able to do much beter than Mr kennedy.. The rendering and the effects in the book are totaly ridiculous..Even the cover has no connection with the book.. verry bad.Last thing, the web site is full of error and never updated.Please buy another book ! Like 3ds max 6 by Barrett Fox.."
5,Love it!,"Love This backpack! Ilove all of Ogio's products! Light weight....nice padded straps..tons of pockets/space. Perfect for just about any type of travel! Im in the MX photography business and this is my go-to choice backpack. I also have two more Ogio bags, Terminal Rolling, and 9900 Rolling Duffel Bag Great for travel! Highly recommend Ogio.So if your looking for a great durable backpack...this is one is great!!OGIO Metro Backpack"
3,"Doesn't fit a 17"" laptop","After much consideration I ordered this bag. I checked the measurements of my laptop and it should have fit but it does not. Be aware that it may not fit your 17"" laptop. I liked the design and the padding was excellent. However, I did not like the shoulder straps. The padding on them does not go down far enough and the buckle dug into me."
5,Best commuter backpack out there,This is my 3rd time buying this backpack! I have had this same style for about 8 years and I can't find any better setup. These are very durable backpacks that I use every single day of the year on many different journey's.
2,Only on physicists' life and almost none on their achievement!!!,"Of course I understand that Ioan James's intention of writing this book is to give us a more "" human "" aspect about the physicists and not a work on the theory of physics. I fully agree. However he should at least stateat least very briefly about the achievement of the great physicist!! Take for an example, in describing Ampere, he does not even mention about the Ampere's law!!! I think at least in describing various physicists, he should at least state briefly about what contribution of those hysicists. Just on sentence about the equation of the laws would make this book far more interesting! Otherwise, just mention the date of birth, when the phyicist went to univerisity, when he married, when he died etc. I would ask, then what make this physicists worthy of a brief biography and separae them from just an ordinary people?????????????????"
1,Not as advertised,"The scrub I received is non- foaming, has absolutely no scent and is impossible to get out of the bottle. Buyer beware."
3,Fair Performance for cheap price,I' running a lenovo 3000 N100 with .windows vista business.This device complements the one still coming with the manufacturer which is a well known Intel PRO/wireless3945ABG.I didn't find any tech support to operate this adapter at optimal conditions.
2,Come on Linksys!,"Works great for a while then fails. When it works it works great. When it stops, it's a joke. Can't even get a 1 mbps connection. Linksys customer service knows this happens. They must not want to address it."
2,Not a Pretty Upgrade,"Wanted just to upgrade my laptop (Lenovo Thinkpad) from G to an N card. Chose Linksys, since I had heard it was user-friendly. What a nightmare. I wound up spending hours on the phone with tech support, in the Phillipines, of all places. This product is just not made to install easily. I needed much support to get the thing working. I still am not sure it is working, or was worth the upgrade...."
1,Would not connect at all,Installed just fine on my Toshiba until I tried to connect. The Linksys monitor software would not even recognize the card as active. Though it did recognize my old G card. Spent 20 minutes on hold and never did reach tech support. This and the router are being returned.It did work on another Laptop but not the one I intended. There is NO mention of this card at all on the Linksys forums or the easy answer sections.I should know better then trying bleeding edge. Especially with Linksys and there questionable support
2,Well written book on a non-sensical topic. Save the $$$,"Ellwood writes clearly and to the point. However, in my opinion, Theosophy is really neither worth reading nor writing about. I am returning this book hoping that the store where I bought it will give me credit toward the purchase of something more worthy of my time. Really idiotic stuff!"
5,Delicious and easy to make!,"While I did not purchase these from amazon.com, I noticed the incorrect reviews, these are delicious! So easy to make and great kid to make with a child as it's fun to make and produces a delicious product raved by all who tried it. These are a yearly deal for our family! You can't go wrong purchasing these if you enjoy a sweet treat! Thanks Eagle Brand!"
3,Get First Meditations Instead,"THAT is a 5 star recording as it eliminates Sanders altogether. Without his distracting and unsubtle presence, this music simply soars to the heavens."
2,A boring story that doesn't stand the test of time,"I'm a big fan of cozy mysteries and I picked this novel up because I thought that it would be similar to Agatha Christie's work. I'm in my mid-40's now, but I can remember my mom reading Ngaio Marsh novels as a kid in the '70's. This is the 1st Marsh novel I've ever read and, based on what others have stated, perhaps it shouldn't have been. The characters are very simple and 2-dimensional. Inspector Alleyn and his wife Troy are like Ozzie & Harriet (Nelson). Their son, Ricky, is like...well Ricky Nelson. The characters are so predictable that there is never any mystery as to what they're up to (drug smuggling). I kept waiting for plot twists and turns that never came. In the end, the murderer revealed himself to the police out of guilt. As a reader I felt gypped that he wasn't found out due to clever sleuthing."
3,Disappointing,"I was disappointed in this book.Perhaps I was wrong in expecting something more akin to a biography of Adamsky rather thenan overly long social essay.The author carries his coy andbemused portrayal of Adamsky onfar too long--what at most shouldhave been a brief essay grew tobook length. After a while theone-dimensional semi-joke he attempts to make Adamsky out to be--something akin to how onewho is a little fond of a pet with an entertaining foible mightportray the animal--chasing itstail, for example, grows very, very thin."
3,Very useful information but needs more detail!,"This book provides information essential to anyone hoping to conduct business in France. However, I would have liked a more in-depth and detailed look at everyday business affairs. This book highlights the major differences of the French and American approaches to business. Also recommend ""French or Foe"" by Polly Platt."
5,Excellent storyteller,"I literally could not put this book down from start to finish. Whether you like baseball, dislike the Yankees, or just enjoy rooting for the one guy who could have saved baseball from the financial and legal disasters of the past 50 years, this book will be one of the best you have ever read."
5,Book that defines what sports writing should be!!!,This is the best sports book I have read. It stands up very well over time. He is just so good natured and good humored and it really comes through in the writing. I would highly recommend this book for any sports fan and anyone else for that matter.
3,Read it only if you're an Alcott-aholic,"When I was in elementary school, I was an Alcott-alolic. That is, I read every one of her novels every year. Her books are definatly age oriented-you'll hate them if you're over 11 yrs. old. If your already hooked on Jo and other Alcott characters, by all means read this book,it's entertaining and good clean fun. Too many kids read skanky trash today, so, while Little Men is definately not as good as Little Women (Jo loses some spunk), I still reccomend it."
5,Little Men,Excellent book. I enjoyed reading this book. The whole series of these are good reading for readers of any age.
3,Very sweet,"This book is nowhere near as good as ""Little Women,"" but it's nice to see the future of Jo, Meg, Amy, Laurie, and all of the family, though the adults are featured very little. The boys that Jo and her husband are raising and teaching get into fun, silly adventures. This book is both heartwarming and, at times, heart-wrenching. If you like stories about children and their joys and triumphs, you'll enjoy this sweet little book.All that being said, the Kindle version has MANY editorial mistakes; words missing, misspelled, a word which was clearly mistakenly entered in place of another, etc."
4,Wonderful book for both children and adults.,"I first read this book when I was a child, and I love it just as much now as I did then. It's a great book to read to and discuss with your children.I would have given this review 5 stars instead of 4, except for one flaw. The Kindle version of this book is full of spelling and punctuation errors. Not a big deal for some, but it's just one of those things that bugs me.Then again, at a cost of $.86, I guess I don't really have room to complain. :)"
3,Kept waiting for something to happen,"This book was hard to get into. Austen takes the story of two sisters, one quick to emotion and the other reasonable nearly to a fault and puts them in a similar situation of unreturned fancy. In the right hands this could be an interesting story and you would think Austen would make it so. Unfortunately not, her story is dull and I kept waiting for something to happen. There was no biting irony or under the surface commentary. This being Jane Austen's first novel explains some of it. You see a few glimpses of her use of language and irony but not enough to carry this book. I give this a C-."
4,"Title should be Senseless, Sensibility","It is remarkable how the women of the period had to put up with so many different pressures then of today. Consider that there was little of entertainment other than board games back then. Or why else would all these women engage themselves with so much frivolous talk and innuendo. With nothing to do for a ""career"" than to find the right man to marry, what else was there to do? It is a interesting picture of the times. The woman's honour having to be at stake if they chose wrongly. Marrying into money, and caste never mind the female biology. But at a few times the women gets together had gossip like hens while others suffers in silence. The illustrations were a nice touch too."
4,Classic,Classic story of life and love. A bit difficult to read in the old English but having seen the movie made it more understandable.
5,For my daughter's English class,I bought this for my daughter's sophomore English class. It's one she's always wanted to read and was so excited to get it. Jane Austen presents a fabulous view of the struggle between logic and emotion and romance in the Victorian era.
2,a five star book with a 0 star critical apparatus,"Sense and Sensibility is a work of wit intelligence and genius--the critical apparatus and here I mean the work of modern critics is the work of those ""favored"" by stupidity. With the exception of Raymond Williams important article from ""Keywords"" --the critics are informed by a feminism that might be called Sexual Stalinism. Critics with agendas are always reductive, unreflective and in the case of one essay unpardonably vulgar. I name no names. William Empson's exploration of ""Sense"" ""Sensibility"" ""Candour"" and ""Candid"" which are briliantly investigated in his Structure of Complex Words apparenty was not deemed worthy of making the cut. Jane Austen would have had a good laugh had she read the sanctimonious essays that befoul this edition. If you are a good reader trust your own responses and get another edition. Of course if you are a member of the academy this edition is indispensable."
3,Not her best,"The funny thing about Austen's work is that, although not much happens in her books, they are always interesting. Sense and Sensibility is in fact interesting, but lacks something. The ending is disappointing, and overall, it wasn't nearly as good as Emma."
4,sense and sensibity,"had not read this book since school days , its a joy to read , and one gets a real feel for the times when women were dependent on their men folk , not allowed to own property in their own right , and a good marriage was the aim"
3,"Enduring classic, okay edition","Of course, Jane Austen is fabulous. Set in England's Regency period, the story revolves around the Dashwood sisters and their love interests. The difference with this edition is the inclusion of notes on the side relating geographic info, historic tidbits, info about the movies based on the book, theological reflections and the opinions of the editors about the story and characters.At first, I was put off by the constant interruption of the side notes. I grew to appreciate mainly the historical and geographical information, but occasionally felt irked by the opinion flavored notes. I think if I were choosing between a notated or un-notated novel, I'd choose the latter. Nevertheless, any Jane Austen book is well worth reading. (I received a copy of this book free from Bethany Publishers.)"
3,Sense and Sensibility,"This could be considered boring by anyone who liked action books; however, it is written in Jane Austen's usual form and deals with a time when ladies were considered to be protected by the gentlemen from anything that might be in the least distasteful or less than proper. I found myself wishing it could move at a faster pace, but considering the period of time it was written, overall it was an interesting read."
3,Austen late-comer.,"I tried very hard all through high school and college to be a Jane Austen fan. I could never get fully engrossed in one of her books and thus assumed that the writing style just didn't appeal to me. But once I tackled Sense and Sensibility, I found that Austen could engage me after all. I love Austen's structuring of this book--the contrast of the Dashwood women and the subtle caricatures presented in their surrounding families. And I thought the plot was plenty dramatic enough to carry me through to the final page. I finished it in three days."
1,Sink exploded for seemingly no reason,"I was excited to find this sink - exactly what I was looking for and a great price. It installed easily and worked great for a couple of weeks. My father-in-law was using it - finished brushing his teeth, walked out of the bathroom, and it exploded into thousands of little pieces all over the bathroom. Have no idea why, but definitely won't buy another. Very strange!"
5,should cost more,"This is a heavy, thick, well made glass vessel sink. Fit and finish are very good. and the price is right. It is bigger.. i think than other sinks like It I saw at big box stores. Glad I purchased it."
4,I like these shorts,"I bought these shorts because I had some exactly like them made by the big ""U-"" manufacturer, which were starting to show their age. Well-made shorts, I am able to move well in them. The only thing lacking (which my other shorts have) is a back pocket to put my keys/phone/wallet/etc. If I had that, I could give 5 stars."
1,concerned parent,I was concerned when my son found a skelton with a BRA draped over it's body on the FIRST page - hello folks! are you kidding me? someone explain to me why this is in a children's christmas book.....
5,Excellent Overview,"The book is an excellent overview of the Nuremberg Trials. It explains the background for the creation of the Court, the purposes of creating the Court and the impact of Allied conduct during the war on the charges, evidence used against the defendents and areas of conduct explored by the prosecution in their pursuit of convictions. I found the presentation of evidence of the German Naval activity during the war while trying to avoid reflection on allied Naval activity, extremely interesting. A Well Written and Easy Read.The Nuremberg Trial"
2,fair,Too much detail about every ones opinyon how the trial should be run. I was hoping it would be about the trials them selves
2,disappointing,"Not as good as it was raved about. What was the point of wasting several pages of this book with a part from the script of the movie ""Slap Shot"" ????"
2,**,"From a Richard Poe article ""Friedan's legend paints her as an ordinary housewife who turned feminist after realizing that she was bored with married life. `In reality,` says Horowitz, `Friedan spent 25 years as a professional journalist in the Communist Left` before writing The Feminine Mystique in 1963. `She was a Stalinist at Smith College. She was never a housewife. Her whole life is a lie.'"""
1,"Poor, poor Ms. Betty Friedan",Ms. Friedan was so unhappy with her life and her choices that she believed other women must also be unhappy....so she wrote a book about her unhappiness and tried to get other women to believe her thoughts set forth in this book. A whiney book from a whiney woman who had nothing better to do than sit around and write about the unhappiness and misery which she brought upon herself. If I could give this a negative star rating I would give it at least a minus 10 stars.
4,Great Reading,"I loved this book. It was extremely inspiring and resourceful, especially if you want to learn more about gender relations in the U.S.It focuses on the time period after the war, and how gender binaries were very explicit. It also intersects with psychology and work- and most importantly the value of men's work versus women's work (domestic housework).Only lacking was women of color and non-heterosexuality differences.Still for a beginners course to feminism and gender studies, this is a great place to start."
5,Two Thumbs Up!,I love the book. Anyone who does not love the book has got to be crazy. It struck the core of many problems that women still face today. It gave me the courage to stand up for what I want. I agree that Betty Friedan is like a Martin Luther King Jr. for Women.
1,EXTREMELY old product!,This was the old blue and gold version that retired YEARS before they changed it to black packaging. They showed the black packaging in the picture so I assumed that's what it was. Seller did offer a refund if I shipped it back but not worth the shipping charges or taking time off work because of their bad business. This makeup was so old and awful my face broke out!
4,Still very good after all these years!,It took me years to get a copy of this movie and was well worth the time and energy. Thanks to Amazon and their contacts!!!
1,Worst Phone Ever!,"I guess I deserved this! I purchased the RCA 2542RE1 phone for my 2 line business. I carefully researched the product, and read so many reviews. I really just felt like that there was NO WAY that a 4 line phone would not let you answer a call on line 1,(even though I had been warned) and someone else answer the ringing line on the 2nd phone- but it is true! As I am on line one, and line 2 is ringing, all I can do is let it ring- it will not even go to an answering machine- my customers probably think I run a shabby business! There were people who said this, but I just knew that they had to be wrong.....so, shame on me for not listening to what people said. DO NOT BUY!!!!"
5,Mad Cobra his at his peak performance!,"On this album Mad Cobra seamlessly meshes reggae dancehall with rap and R&B. The first track ""Big Long John"" sets the tone for the album: hard core, yet soft, love. On the track ""Don't Need Headlights"", Mad Cobra combines with Brown Sugar, showing the wonderful, groovy, smooth mesh of reggae dancehall and R&B. On track 8, ""Sting Night"" with Ninja Man, Cobra shows us raw dancehall style, almost like a rap combination that's explosive. Finally, on track 14, ""It's A Shame"", Mad Cobra shows his versatility to rap with a dancehall flavor. This album is a must have. Mad Cobra is at his peak!"
3,~cute~,"This is a sweet book, where the good prevails the evil. I enjoyed the easy-flowing dialogue, the whimsical characters and the lightness of the whole reading experience. I might proceed to other books in the Devil's Point series.Holly Lisle, the author of the book, is a great teacher of writing: check out her books and classes, I highly recommend them!"
4,The Start of a Hellishly Funny Series,"I recently read the Hell books by Holly Lisle (or at least the first three). The books are concerned with the presence of the hellraised on Earth and the interplay between Heaven and Hell.In SYMPATHY FOR THE DEVIL a young woman who is convinced that her ex is in hell offers up a prayer to give everyone in Hell a second chance. The request is so pure that it must be answered. Since everyone in Hell already has a chance for redemption, Heaven sends residents from hell to North Carolina. These hellraised equal one percent of the population of the state. The woman is made a target for temptation while the rest of the state has to get used to its new residents.Overall a pretty good story and an interesting handling of Heven and Hell and they way they interact with the mortal world."
2,A lot of ore for a few golden nuggets,"Okay, I admit I don't know how anthologies work, and maybe some of the stories couldn't be more tightly edited for this book, because they had already been published, elsewhere. That's one possibility, but it only addresses one issue: the editing. Unfortunately, it was the nature of many of the stories themselves that I found off-putting, because of the heavy handed handling of the subject matter. Eros is a state of mind and as such it takes many forms, but an over reliance on descriptively graphic details of ""orifice plugging"" is not, in my opinion, erotic; that's about as sexually stimulating as pulling weeds.""Mitsuko"", however, is solid gold."
5,Absolutely Marvelous!,"A fine anthology debut from a fine writer! There is no shortage of masterful storytelling in Erotic Travel Tales, not to mention masterful writing. Absolute stunners in this collection include Mitsuko, Moonburn, Journey of My Hands, and Lilly's Loulou. And the writers sound every bit as interesting as their stories, judging by the bios in the back of the book. I only hope that Ms. Szereto decides to treat us again with another volume of Erotic Travel Tales? I've got my passport ready!"
3,Barely watchable,"Travolta carries it. Generally the acting is abysmal, but given their lines it would be difficult to be otherwise. Whoever wrote the script should be sent back to writers school.SPOILER ALERT!At the end, listen to the crap that Andie MacDowell sprouts as Michael is preparing to return!!!Ummm...seriously? Don't bother."
4,Where's the Wide Screen Version?,"Michael is a fantastic, funny, uplifting movie that everyone should see. All the characters are perfectly portrayed.The only request I would make (hence the 4 stars instead of 5) is that it be released in wide screen. There are some scenes that are beautifully crafted on film, but are lost in the reformatted version."
1,Makes one long for hell,"Obvious situations, forced humor, typical Hollywood caricaturization of the Midwest -- otherwise I hated it.Travolta was revolta. John Candy would have been a better angel -- Uncle Buck run amok."
5,movie,This is touching movie will melt your heart ad touch your soul!!! See John Travolta in a different role.
5,excellent,Perfectly charming without being saccharine or whimsical. They are both written and translated beautifully with wit and sensitivity. The poems range from heartwarming to heartbreaking to comedic. There is something here for every age and temperament.
3,ok for the price,This is a good match and a great price but the mirror itself was distorted. It really doesn't mater to me because I just use it for changing lanes
5,Great Kids Music,"I bought the new John Lithgow album for my little cousins and they love it! They dance around the house to the music and can't stop singing the catchy songs. Lithgow uses classic songs that I have even heard before, which makes it nice to babysit and listen to good kids music. Your kids will love this CD!"
2,Not what I thought (or was hoping for),The only thing that I found wanting to watch was the announcer of each short film. He's the hotty on the cover. the casting is definately B [sub]quality. None of the shorts were what I thought they would be. A swing and a miss.
5,Amazing Feat,"This book is not about a nice long relaxing canoe trip on serene waters. Although Starkell and his boys DO have some quiet carefree times...the majority of this trip includes an astounding amount of obstacles that very very people would chose to endure. Numerous problems arise from the natural world...but the most frightening adventures are the frustrations and threats that the Starkells recieve from their fellow man.This is an amazing book and a must read for any canoe tripper. Also, anyone interested in true life adventure stories will surely not be disappointed. It's a gripping tale from start to finish. It's also a feat that will probably never be attempted again.The only big question I have after reading this book is..Why hasn't someone made this gem into a movie? With all the twist and turns you'd think it would be a great candidate for the big screen."
4,Good back exercises,"This book has some good back exercises. They start off very simple like streching but increase in intensity. Another book to consider is ""Healing Back Pain"" and it deals more with the mind, emotions side of what causes back pain."
5,I tell my back-bothered friends about it.,"When I was sentenced, years ago, to two weeks bed rest for sciatica lower back pain, a neighbor lent me the book. I read the humorous real life story of tribulations with surgery, chiropractic, and accupuncture, then started doing the simple exercises in the book's appendix. What a great thing! Slow steady progress until I got back to enjoying tennis at full enthusiasm. I even use one or two of the exercises on a plane for ironing out the kinks from flying for a couple of hours. It has been wonderful for me!"
4,A Great band stemming from SUMthing greater,"Sleepwalker is the brainchild of Jamal Rhue (spelling?) A local Tempe, AZ artist formerly of the band One. In Sleepwalker, Jamal & Co. present of a host of haunting and melancholy tunes, backed up by an incredible bass line. Jamal's signature reverb / pedal guitar compliments his sad and dreamy vocals in songs like ""Pretty Soon Ill be getting Out of Here"" and ""Hey Jill"". before Sleepwalker, Jamal was in a band called One with his sister Shamsi. It's too bad mercury records screwed this band up. Jamal if your out there, Id like to get my hands on any recored One tracks. Sleepwalker is a wonderful Phoenix rising from the ashes of One / Sum-One."
2,nesting lawn mower,"My grandson liked this toy but it's construction was not worth the price. I liked that the handle folded down to store flat, but when you pull up the handle, it wasn't completely stationary making it wobbly and hard for him to push smoothly. It kept catching on little ruts, causing the front wheels to stop and the back wheels to go up in the air."
1,REALLY cheaply made - should be in the dollar store,"We've got 4 boys and as each of them entered toddlerhood we got a new push-along mower. But this one has to be the most cheaply constructed mower ever made. Talk about flimsy... We took it out of the box yesterday and we were sorely disappointed with the quality. I don't even thnk it would take my toddlers weight leaning against it. It looks and feels like it would be the one needing the support, not my son. It is made from 1 piece of pressed plastic and is hollow underneath - really thin. We boxed it up and it goes back tomorrow. Don't buy this one - get a more durable one than this."
3,Decent book,"The Runaway is a decent book but its very formulaic like all of the other Fear Street books. They all have a young female have a crush on a guy, they don't have much of a personality. Also the book shares a few similarities with ""Carrie"" which supports my statement of R.L. Stein being ""The Poor Man's Stephen King"" (Or at least when he writes ""Adult"" Books) Its not really a bad book but its far from great."
4,FunkTastic!,Very good selection of rare groove and funk from the seventies. Excellent package with the coolest design! Worth the money!
4,The OTHER Funk singles,"What It Is! (Box set): These are the Funk singles you may have forgotten, or may have never heard. There are some key rare vocal singles here and a lot of instrumental (or nearly all instrumental) tracks here. To be honest, this was not what I expected to hear when I first played it, but I now find myself playing it a lot, and liking everything about it. It's not for everyone, just those who want to be able to groove through their day. Four Stars."
4,Soul-tastic... All Hail Rhino! Nobody knows box like Rhino knows box,"I stumbled over this set just a few days ago, and I have to say that it's easily one of the top 10 best random-artist compilations I've ever heard in my life, and I own hundreds of them.I won't say there's no filler--by filler I mean the cover tunes--and I'm confused as to why ""What So Never The Dance"" is credited to the Houseguests when this is a longtime Bootsy Collins track? What, is Bootsy in trouble with Warner Brothers and can't re-release his own stuff under his own name anymore?But disc one is an absolute gem--you can't make your own mix better than they've done it here. If you're a fan of James Brown, Parliament, Otis Redding, Sly Stone, the aforementioned Bootsy, Tower Of Power, Prince, early Stevie Wonder, Motown, Isaac Hayes, then you shouldn't be without this set.Absolutely worth buying."
4,Interesting,"I will review this product from its material standpoint and not from an implementation standpoint. The book was part of a class I took in Carnegie Mellon. It makes for a fascinating read. Some of the topics are excellent food for thought for human/user centric design of software products. The class assignments involved mock implementations of the concepts described in the book which was fun.Coming from an embedded world, I haven't had a chance to implement these ideas in my day to day work but if I ever work on a user centric product, I hope to try some of the ideas.Good read."
3,Contextual design,"The book is as described by the seller, but there where shipping mishandling and shipping took to long."
5,An explosive mix,"A fascinating book. Paul Grondahl shows TR's political rise as an explosive combination of two different factors or forces -- one internal and one external.These forces are on display on the cover of the book. The title (""rose like a rocket"") suggests the circumstances that quickly propelled TR into political opportunity. New York, and the nation, were ripe for a patrician reformer. Yet, as the book makes clear, Roosevelt's life consisted as much of sorrow as of opportunity. So external events are insufficient to explain his success.The subtitle (""political education"") suggests the more important factor -- TR's intellectually aggressive approach to life, which enabled him to constantly improve by learning from his mistakes. Roosevelt himself seldom admitted to mistakes. So it takes a great journalist and historian like Grondahl to extract those lessons for us. A very enjoyable piece of detective work!"
5,love his whiney voice and lyrics,"this cd has been a pleasure to listen to. my husband called mando a ""dylan wannabe"" but i've really enjoyed it."
3,wish it would work as a minimizer,"I like it, but wish that cups would be more of a minimizer than the ones which enhance the size"
3,"OK for surround sound, OK value for the money","Not well packaged within factory box, the styrofoam packing was broken-up badly. Speakers knocked together during shipping and the grills are now dented. Factory box was well packed within Amazon box, so damage was not found until I openned everything up. Not worth the aggrivation of sending them back. I wanted something ""quick and inexpensive"". The speakers work fine for my rear-channel surround-sound application (which is not that critical to overall audio experience). I feel I got what I paid for, but these are NOT ""400 Watt"" speakers."
3,Warmed over NWOBHM,"1989's Live Fast, Die Fast was the debut album from British hard rock act Wolfsbane, which is perhaps best known for featuring vocalist Blaze Bayley before his (mercifully) brief stint with the legendary Iron Maiden.Live Fast, Die Fast is essentially a New Wave of British Heavy Metal (NWOBHM) album that came about 8 years too late. It wasn't metal by 1989's standards, and aside from some very ""metal"" solos didn't seem relevant to the types of metal that were popular at the time. The basic, fast paced dirty hard rock of Live Fast, Die Fast sounds more like a leftover album by Dragster or Trespass. I keep trying to hear what might have made Bayley such an appealing choice to replace Bruce Dickinson, but nothing here is convincing me.Wolfsbane's debut is a completely decent, completely forgettable late 80's hard rock album. Unless you're a major Blaze fan or are compiling some kind of Maiden tie-in collection, I can't give this album a very strong recommendation."
4,Nice glow,These bulbs seem to be very good quality. They provide a lovely glow and help create warm ambiance in any room.
4,Ahem,"Definately different, sometimes you wonder if it borders lines into that Mommas jazz style. But its such an odd selections. The movies great, also check out the Rushmore soundtrack, it really rocks."
5,i thought it was the best soundtrack i've heard,"this cd really brought out the best songs from the best scenes in the movie. if you enjoyed the film bottle rocket, i suggest you buy this cd because it will make you appreciate the good music. i, being a true bottle rocket and wes anderson fan, see this cd as a gem."
1,for spencer,"Actually, the song from the house robbery is ""7 & 7's"", by the Ramones from the album Acid Eaters. Another song unlisted and also hard to find is a Love cover-song called ""Anything"", performed by the Damned."
5,Chuck Berry on speed,"This Japanese three-piece play lightning fast, stripped down, roots rock with punk attitude. Imagine Teengenerate with better production quality. Some of the songs have very un-politically correct titles, but don't let that scare you. Because, if that happens you'll be missing out on one the best bands to come out of the far east since Loudness!"
2,"confusing, hard to follow...","My first Akunin book, so maybe that was the problem. I had trouble keeping the characters straight and often had trouble plowing through the prose. Maybe it's just not my style."
3,Misleading picture,"The product is alright but the picture is really misleading. I thought they were black! I know the title says ""silver aluminum"" but I thought that was refering to the arms that clip onto your bike."
3,"Okay, as These Things Go","I enjoy lute music a great deal, but in a casual sense. I'm not capable of discoursing on technique, and I certainly can't analyze one performer's skills over that of another. And as a casual, untrained listener, I'd rate this disc as not bad but also not necessarily anything remarkable. There are a couple pieces by Holborne and two by Sylvius Weiss, but pretty much everything else was material I'd never heard before. I would describe the disc's offerings as mostly introspective and subdued, which for me is fine up to a point, but I will admit that I did begin to chafe about midway through. If there had been more of an ebb and flow in mood, I would have enjoyed this disc more than I did. As it stands, I'd rate this as your typical low-energy Renaissance to Baroque lute album. In other words, meh."
1,God Will Deal With Hal In His Own Way!,"Hal Lindsey's books of the 1970's world ending are simply updated for the 1990's. Nothing new except the places, events, and characters change with no visible or historical checking of the facts or scriptures. If there is a false prophet the first suspect should be Hal Lindsey. If you have the money and time to invests into a charity do it rather than promote this book of mumbo-jumbo. You can enrich your own life by just reading Dr. Seuss rather than the misquoted, changeable and lack of facts as proposed by senile Hal."
2,How Ironic....,"That Hal Lindsey write how my people, the Jewish people have survived for millenia the attempted destruction and the abuse and humiliation at the hands of our enemies. That our survival is Biblical prophecy and that our ingathering is a millenial sign. Yes all this is true, it cannot be doubted. But what hurts me and hurts every Jew that I speak to, it the fact that Xians speak of all these pogroms and murders as if they were looking from the outside. If they only looked down at their hands they would see the blood of my people staining their finger nails. The fact that they so easily cast it off and give no second thought to their barbacity, and the murder and hatred of their ancestor is insulting. A fell good book for murderers and oppressor as so how all this was ment to be and the world is good. Yes we have survived the murders and the attempted conversion to a pagan heretic false god, and we have maintained to believe in the G-d of Israel, but no thanks to you and your people!"
5,Beautiful Set,I bought these to make raised panel shutters for the front of my house. They worked out great. I was able to reconfigure the bits to work for my needs considering that the shutters are only one sided. Expensive but very high quality. Nice case too.
3,"Strong Scent. Also, $10.00 at TJ Maxx.","I remember liking this product more than I do now. I used it back in the 1980s and it was very gentle and not as strong smelling. I still like it, but I am thinking about watering it down or something because of the strong smell. Also, I don't remember it burning when you washed your ""parts"" with it. Now, it burns! I think I may go back to my Neutrogena or Arizona Sun. Arizona Sun is quite similar, but with a lovely smell that isn't as strong and doesn't burn. It is quite expensive though."
5,viitabath moisturizing bath gelee,"i have been using vitabath for the last 30 years, it is the most amazing product of all time.maqkes you fel alive.."
5,Vitabath Plus for Dry Skin Bath & Shower Gelee,"I've been using this product for several years. While I experiment with different soaps during warm weather, I use only Vitabath Plus for Dry Skin from the first sign of cold weather to the last. It is the only product I've found that keeps my skin moisturized during the cold, dry weather. It costs a little more than many other products, but it's definitely worth it. And the 32 oz size lasts several months."
1,Subsribe to (insert fitness magazine here) instead,"I was excited about getting this book...and then I was disappointed. Most of the exercises you need equipment for--therefore you can't do the variations that seem so essential for this to work. Secondly, there is no real formula for upping the cardio workout. It just didn't seem fair that my money went here instead of a charity."
3,Golly Gosh!,"I'll gladly admit that Sonny was in top form on this date, and it's one of his best ever albums. It is loads better than some of the crap I've given the big old ***** treatment to- BUT- and this is a big BUT- the title track is so catchy it has been stuck in my head for over a decade. I am sick of walking around with the dang thing digging it's talons into my gray matter, and as much as I love it- I PRAY IT WILL GO AWAY! Catchy like some crazy virus. BEWARE!"
3,Beware- Only the Supplement to 7th edition....,I too heard about what a great resource this was for teachers and couldn't wait to get it! It arrived today and as previously stated - it is only the supplement to the 7th edition. :(
1,Cheap piece of crap,Ok so I opted for this one since it had the vibration. Bad choice the plastic broke on the 1st use. Should have bought the cheaper non vibrating metal one. Hindesite is 20/20.
3,Electric Head Tripper,"The products works great, I just wish that the comapny would have told me that the prongs that go on your head are plastic. They are so easy to break and very hard to replace. I was dissapointed by that fact. I would have purchased this product from a manufacturer that has one with metal prongs had I have known this."
4,Flower in the Crannied Wall,"Ride around with Thubron in the last years of the crumbling Soviet Union. He takes you into the apartment buildings to find some of the most interesting -- and heartening -- testaments to human color ever encountered in travel writing.There are some truly jaw-dropping observations made by our driver as he stumbles upon people who are dealing with oppression in ways that ""westerners"" have never had to imagine.Through the vodka, through the endlessly repeating housing blocs, Thubron takes us to a deeper, more personal understanding of life under the Soviets. On the way, he introduces us to individuals (yes, strong individuals) that are not easy to forget."
3,An American Classic Chillingly Told,"Actually 3.5 stars. Certainly a disturbing piece of work and written is such a way that it would be easy to confuse this as an autobiographical work. The description of the descent into mental illness is so vivid that the readers might question their own mental health. Powerfully written and moving.My only fault with the book was towards the end. While Ms. Plath goes into depth with the descent into mental illness, the reverse is not true. The protagonist's climb to mental health is not documented at all. I would go into detail for this review, but that would involve spoilers. But, it affected me enough that I cannot give the book the full number of stars I would have intended."
4,Suicide Brunette,"I definately connected with the main character in The Bell Jar. Can't remember her name, isn't that terrible? I think her character was undiagnosed bipolar. I've felt the same kind of pain in my life as hers, although I've never attempted to commit suicide. The most interesting parts of the story is when she's experimenting with different ways of killing herself. The style of writing for Sylvia Plath is very artful and descriptive. There were some slow parts in the novel and some of it was labourious to get through but overall it's an interesting story."
4,A tight grasp on reality,"Sylvia Plath , is the most realistic writer I've ever read. I know everybody loves fantasy , but sometimes, we all just want to curl up and read books that will make us feel. Like this one. She words things really well. I think this book makes people feel better for some reason. I would read it,it's g ood!"
4,A decent book!,"I had heard from a number of people that this was a book that was worth my time. It was a quick read, and it was pretty enjoyable. The description on the back cover of the book says it's about Plath's descent into insanity (<-- not a direct quote). However, it wasn't much of a descent. It was more like, she wasn't insane at the end of one chapter, and at the beginning of another chapter she was suddenly insane.Regardless, it was a pretty good book. Not spectacular, but interesting enough to hold my attention."
2,"Falls short of expectations of ""brilliance""","I am almost sorry to say that my reading of Sylvia Plath's novel ""The Bell Jar"" was not nearly as moving or thought-provoking as it seems to be for so many. In my opinion, ""The Bell Jar""'s Esther Greenwood is entirely unsympathetic, to the detriment of the novel. While I recognize the necessity of emphasizing her deterioration, I found her to be overly melodramatic and weak (while still recognizing her ""condition""), and I loathed her from the start. While I will allow that Plath's prose is more eloquent than her poetry I failed to find evidence of the brilliance so often extolled."
4,Downward Spiral,"This is a very pointed look at a young woman's descent into psychosis. Plath is a blunt author and there are many questions as to if this book is an autobiography. The main character, Esther, uses many aliases (aliai?) and tells a story that lines up quite well with that of Mrs.Plath. This was a required reading book this year at school for me, but I will tell you this. I read it over the summer and liked it-but I enjoyed it more this time around. This is a powerful book and is written with a lot of well thought out imagery and symbolism. If you have seen the movie Girl, Interupted or read One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest you will find this book of interest. But if you have a light stomach beware in the last three or so chapters. One of my all time favorites!"
4,The Bell Jar is a jarring journey through mental illness.,"For anyone who has lived with/through clinical depression or any for of mental illness, The Bell Jar is a must read. Few authors have been successful at capturing this horrifying illness so poignantly, yet realistically. The reader is invited to experience the throngs of depression as it takes hold and tortures the individual so intensely, that for many the only way to end the emotional pain is self-destruction. Although suicide is not the answer, it exists as the one sure way to end the misery of everday existence.'How tragic that Esther is freed from her demons and Sylvia, herself, was not. This work is a masterful at exposing depression as an ugly and debilitating illness."
3,Fine work exploring descent into depression,"A strong narrative that delivers a look into the steadily imploding life of a young woman. The writing is crisp and accessible, and I gained an appreciation for Plath away from her poetry and messy personal life.Strongly recommended, particularly as a feminine counterweight to 'The Catcher in the Rye"
2,Slowest book ever,"Plath gets you in tune with only one character throughout this book. She overly describes everything and slows down the whole story. After reading this book, I will never buy another Sylvia Plath story, but I do want her collected poems. Her description of places and events throughout the story were fascinating."
5,Very well written,"I've never been good with my words, so I will try my best to review it. The Bell Jar gave me a familar feeling when reading it. We follow Esther's slow decent into insanity, and we feel for her as we helplessly tell her that everything is going to be okay. I love that the book ends bitter sweet, that it's not a feel-good ending but it does wring out whatever hope the book may have possessed (which isn't much). Whether it was Plath's memoir or not, the fact remains that we see a tortured artists' view point onto what the world really looked like to her, through Esther. I will never get rid of this book."
4,Good Read,Very enjoyable read. I could picture one of my aunts being in college with the main character in the book. Very accurate description of the way I remember things from the time.
4,Not to be overlooked,Remembering whether I read this before or not was difficult so I purchased it for my Kindle & loved every page of it.
5,"Genuine, masterful and poingnant","Many things fascinated me about The Bell Jar. One is that I knew the story of Sylvia Plath's suicide before I read it, so I knew I was not merely reading a story. I was reading Sylvia Plath's own deepest fears and ambitions and joys, many of which I could relate to. It is fascinating how seemlessly her writing flows from her sanity to insanity in a way in which you can barely tell when the change began. It is almost eery (and a bit frightening) when you realize how many moments in Esther's life you can completely relate with emotionally. And finally, it was fascinating to learn from her story, how a seemingly normal person's mental stability can be so fragile and unreliable. I will never forget this book as long as I live, and recommend it with all my heart. MRL"
1,Canceled order,Waited too long for Amazon to send this book so I canceled the order. I'll purchase somewhere close to home without a month wait.
2,Not my type of read,"This was not my type of book. After reading ""An Unquiet Mind"" and ""Girl Interrupted"" , I should have realized this is not a book that was going to keep my interest. The writing is very choppy. The time and place changes through out the book and it is difficult to follow at times. I do think the story of Sylvia Plath is very interesting. And sad. I would probably be more interested in reading a book about her written by someone else."
5,It's her,"A review??? It's Sylvia Plath, need we say more...Master of work..Master of poem, totally the greatest..."
5,quick shipping!,The book was shipped quickly and was received in the condition that it had stated when purchased.
2,An electric soup of mangled memories and submerged vision.,"This curiosity, the only live entry in the Wire canon, is the antipathy of the stadium live opus despised by these art school graduates on a punk rock mission. Sounding almost wholly improvised, this smorgasbord of decaying power pop and art gallery installations is at best chaotic, at worst narcissistic in its own sense of post punk artrock indulgence. Impossible to single out songs, but titles include: ""Eels Sang Lino"", a Burroughsesque barrel roll and ""Piano Tuner (Keep Strumming Those Guitars)"", a bedlamatic strip of shouty pop. These two disparate items are indicative of the album's psychotic appeal. An overview would recommend this strongly to existing Wire fans but the unconverted should begin with ""154"" or ""Chairs Missing""."
3,Lovely but a bit repetitive.,"""The Pearl"" is the second collaborative album by ambient pioneer Brian Eno and minimalist composer/pianist Harold Budd. Like their previous effort (""The Plateaux of Mirror""), it is a delicate and fragile record, similar in mood and style.Essentially, all the pieces on the album are simple piano statements by Budd with ambient hazes in the background. Budd's compositions are evocative and moody, his playing simple and delicate-- with the framework Eno and Daniel Lanois (who produced the album together) set up, the themes paint intriguing pictures, primarily of melancholy.But like that album, there's a tendency towards repetition on this one. My notes on the performances are by-and-large the exact same comments each time, No one piece really shines out-- everything is superb but nothing is totally engaging. This is what keeps my from rating this album five stars. Still, if you enjoyed ""The Plateaux of Mirror"", you'll no doubt enjoy this one as well."
2,Disapointing,"I was misled by Frances Mayes' name listed next to the author's.She wrote only the introduction. This was not a colaboration.The book itself was basically dry, boring, dated, plot-less and less than wonderful.I think it was reprinted to ""jump on the ""Tuscany"" bandwagon"" of popularity. I could not recommend this book."
1,Too Small,Too small for a temporary home. Not bad I guess if you wanted to put one in there while your changing your REAL tank. You can get a 5 gal for cheaper at some places. Please be kind!
4,Not for a permanent home,"I bought a new fish and needed to quarantine him for a bit so I could monitor him for disease. This tank was super cheap and I like that there's a little thing for changing water in the bottom. That said, having two bettas in this tank is ridiculous. Even having one in here permanently would be cruel. My fish is only going to live in this tank, with careful monitoring, for two weeks tops before he goes into a bigger tank with some other fish. This is just way too small even for a betta. As many others have pointed out, yes they can survive. You could survive in a closet too if someone fed you and removed waste. Would you be happy?"
1,cruel,Just because a Betta can survive in small conditions because in their natural environment during the drought season doesn't mean that we should keep them in those conditions. Many Bettas don't survive these rough conditions that nature provides in their home territory. If you buy small cups and throw a fish in them- you are just condemning them to solitary confinement in a prison cell. My Betta is in a 10 gallon tank and you wouldn't believe the fun he has exercising and playing in all that space. If you care- you would never subject this beautiful creature to cups of water if you saw them in gallons of HEATED (they are tropical fish) water!!!!!! Study this fish and you will understand that we take for granted their survival mechanisms and exploit them for our own foolish pleasure.
1,are you serious?,"This item is not nearly big enough for a single betta fish to live happily. They require AT LEAST 2.5 US gallons, a heater and a filter, and bettas are pretty tough fish. Please do not buy this to put a fish in."
1,"Ponderous, dull, and nail-across-the-chalkboards irritating!","So, is, like, the title story supposed to be anything OTHER than a blatant rip-off of Bret Easton Ellis'sAmerican Psycho(1991)?(Oh, wait -- you're, like, actually THINKING about it?)Hilarious!"
5,"Wow Wow Wow, a very worthy read indeed","Each story is a gem in it's own space. Wallace pushes the envelope of fiction writing into a place that is worth the effort to follow. Get your dictionary by your side and be prepared for an unexpected ride. My only regret is that some of the stories end unfinished, which is a clever ploy and shows that he does not pander to the American desire for a pat finish. A much easier and fulfilling read then Infinite Jest."
4,Wallace isn't just a novelist,"I don't know if I'd say he's ""the kookiest,"" but Wallace is definitely one of the most adventurous fiction writers of our time. I don't think I've ever seen such a wide array of forms and styles in one collection. Wallace's stories engage me on a number of levels. He does a lot with meta-narrative, but never enough to detract from the symbolic ideas he's building. The real draw here, though, is his use of language. His choice of words and the combinations he puts them in are a source of continual surprise, and the tortured syntax he often employs might annoy some readers, but it also forces you to relax and yield to the many pleasures these stories have to offer."
5,My First Coltrane Purchase,"Many moons ago, I picked this album (yes, vinyl) and from the opening track, Out Of This World, I became a life long Coltrane fan. The wonderful Soul Eyes follows. Unlike others, I enjoy the Inch Worm, maybe becuase I was quite young when I first heard it. Tunji is a quiet beauty.Since this CD shows many sides of Trane and is not ""out"" - This is a perfect place to start your collection. Keep in mind that the best is yet to come."
4,Where's Previn?,"While I believe this recording rather faithfully captures the spirit of Joplin, especially the seven-minute ""Solace"" track, it seems that Perlman hogs most of the melody-carrying space, while Previn remains the loyal accompanyist. A pity."
4,CD postage,"The CD ordered (Appalachian Journey - Yo-Yo Ma, Meyer, O'Connor) was fine- lovely music, beautifully played, but I was stung by the postage cost. During my online ordering procedure I was asked for the type of postage but not given the postage charges which turned out to be extortionate. These should be made immediately clear at time of ordering. Unhappy."
3,Forced Reunion,This cd could have been better but seem really forced. Like they just did it for the money. I say that cause i read they all broke up again and there is no tour to promote this cd. All around this cd has no classic to rememeber jams that Teddy & Aarron are capable of. Aarron sole joints produced better music than this and this album is better than Blackstreets last album if thats adding much.
1,Not Classical Guy Music,"This is not the Guy, I remember. The tracks don't even sound like Teddy Riley productions. I wish they would have gotten back to those funky rhythms they had back in the day"
4,THE KINGS OF NEW JACK SWING IS BACK !,"Talk about long gaps between albums a full decade before releasing another one wow ! This album follows the same formula as their debut.. GUY.. and their second one The Future.. As a whole the album sounds very dated.. you can call it retro at best.. which is cool with me.. the material doesnt break any new grounds.. but still make it enjoyable listening .. Aaron hasnt sound better on the ballads .. then he does on this effort which seem to make most of the tracks on Guy III.. Of the Uptempo Cuts .. You should give these a listen:Teddy's Jam III: Which borrows from Zapp/Roger 's Dance Floor and I can make you dance.. a very nice homage to the Troutman brothers..Do it : Rump shaking hip hop tune..DancinSpend TimeOf the ballads check these outWhy you wanna keep me from my babyLove OnlineFly AwayRescue meDont u miss me featuring a clever acoustic-spanish Guitar riffWelcome back TEDDY, AARON, DAMION"
3,I Like It,i finally got my copy of the guy 3 album.some of the tracks are cool.my faves:we're comin'rescue medo itlove online2004(i LOVE that beat)i would pick this up to round out your guy collection.
4,Not the,"Although it's not the familiar movie version most of us are expecting, it is word for word, and having both karaoke version and sung on the same album made it easy for us to learn to sing."
3,OK.... But Not The Best,"This is an OK ""Wizard of Oz"" recording... but why is the Wicked Witch of the West played by a man???If your looking for a good ""OZ"" CD, I would suggest the 1998 Madison Square Garden CD that stars Mickey Rooney & Eartha Kitt."
2,If you want a flashlight.....,"I bought this alarm clock because of it's brightness control- I just got a taller night stand, so my alarm clock is a little too close to my face and bright. I saw that this alarm clock had a switch to adjust the brightness and I thought..""great!!"" Well...the first night I had it and set it on the lower brightness setting, and it was like I had a flashlight sitting on my night stand...I could see the SHADOWS of things in the room...my husband just laughed and laughed. I barely slept. If you want your alarm clock to double as a night light, then this is the one for you...if not, you'll likely end up returning it, like I did."
5,Feasting,"Dowland is a composer and a songwriter who made a living out of being depressed to death. Melancholy was the fashion of his time. However, in his time the verb ""to die"" was popular slang for ""to have an orgasm"". This gives a much more cheerful aspect to such lyrics ""to die with thee again"".In some ways, Russell Oberlin's interpretation of Dowland is to be preferred as he sings these songs like a lout with a lute in lust and has a lovely voice, too.But Scholl's voice is incomparable and the depth of sorrow that he invests in every note makes this the album of choice to play when the world has treated you bad. Sit back, sip the beverage that drowns your sorrows best and allow your ears to feast. And pretty soon, you will say: ""Life does not get better than this."""
4,A Thrilling Ride,"I was always a big fan of theme park games. I loved the idea of being able to do so. When I bought my PSP, I was lookin for games that I would have fun playing, and that would kill some time as well. I came across this game, and I'll admit, I was a bit skeptical at first. But this game didn't disappoint me. Not only can I create my own park, but I can play games, ride the rides, and interact with the customers! This game is hours of fun, and I enjoy it everytime I turn it on. Definitely a great game to have, if you like havin fun while killin some time!"
3,"WARNING, NOT BACKWARDS COMPATABL:E","This game is NOT backwards compatable with the Xbox 360. If you dont own a regular xbox, you will be wasting your money."
3,Brickfoot,"This movie was entertaining, the main character played by Semra Turan who has an internal battle with herself. Her character Aicha must reluctantly complete her medical education because of her father's wishes. At the same time she enjoys the thrill of becoming an accomplished Kung-Fu martial artist and struggling with her feelings towards her training and sparring partner Cyron Melville. She has negative issues from her fellow student and nemesis Behruz Benissi. In the end the character Aicha has to come to terms with herself. The fight scenes were good and the story line was good too. I liked the musical score as well. I guess the music in the movie was Turkish Hip Hop and Rap, it had a good beat to it too. The character Aicha definitely had a lot going on for her. To me it seems that in one aspect the movie depicts that although we're not all made to be high profile professionals, we must strive to be the best at what we do in mind and spirit as long as there is a positive end result."
2,"For those who loved ""She"" -- a disappointment.","If you expect the same wonderful experience you received from reading ""She"", you will be disappointed by this book. Leo and party travel to Asia to search for Ayesha and experience similar, but somehow tiresome, adventures. Reread ""She"" instead."
2,Dosen't do talented Britney justice.,"This cd is very medicore. Half the information on Britney is incorrect, and during the interview there are sometimes weird noises in the background (including people talking on the phone, very crappy) and Britney seems very bored with the interviewer, which isn't surprising because he asks to same questions she's been asked numerous times before and isn't very respectful. I'd only recommend this to people who collect ALL things Britney (like myself) or people who just like to hear her voice. Otherwise, save your money."
2,IS THAT WHAT YOU THINK THIS IS ABOUT?!,"Synthesizers? It has nothing to do with the fact that it has them on it. It's what they did with them. 154 had keyboards! It just so happens that their first three albums were their most creative. If you can't hear that, and have to blame it on something like synthesizers, you deserve an album like this!"
4,drive more safely!,"This set has a high-quality sound, which always comes clearly through the earpiece. Get a hands-free set, and use both hands to drive!"
3,Ouch... but is there better?,"Yes, I am one of those ""people"" that love the headset, but also hate it. I have a Nokia phone and have this headset. Like many others, it does the job for short conversations. But, for longer conversations my ear starts to ache and I find myself taking it in and out of my ear.Is there any better though? Until I find a better product with the good sound quality it has, I will keep using this product."
2,elevator music and a bit more,I can join in exactly the same sing sang of my predecessors. It lacks the originality of Getz/Gilberto and we all know how unique they have been! Nevertheless Hawkins is playing very nice. Its the kind of elevator music you would be glad to listen to.
3,Caution on the color,"I don't actually know how well these are going to hold up. They were a gift. However, when I got them1) they just came in a bag. No earrings backing, which I found strange.2) The color is more green than the picture. I was expecting a nice, calm blue. No. More of a bright blue with specks of green and yellow.However, they were very pretty nonetheless. Just realize the picture wasn't exactly what we got."
2,nothing like the novel,"This dvd was nothing like the novel, characters were combine and the story was told out of sequence. It was purchased as a teaching tool to accompany the novel in a special needs class, I was unable to use it for this purpose."
3,COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER - BRIDGET FONDA CARRIES THE SHOW,"I never read the children's classic, but it is set in my home state, on Smith Island in the Chesapeake Bay (but the movie was filmed on the mainland, near Crisfield). The biggest problem was that the film is only 50 minutes long, limiting its potential to tell a full, deep story. Instead, the movie starts story lines, then drops them after 10 minutes. Also the music is almost entirely synthesized, it's OK. The scenery is very pretty. If your kids won't read the book, then OK, put this on. But try to push the book because it will provide a fuller story of sibling rivalry with more impact. Also, look for ER's irascible Dr. Carrie Weaver (Laura Innes) in a small role as the pregnant preacher's wife."
3,"Who wants a ""sensible"" Nutcracker?","In all his Tchaikovsky ballet performances Previn sounds correct and sensible, but in that virtue he misses a lot more. There isn't a grian of passion or fire in this performance and not much buoyancy or fun, either. I want all of that in a Nutcracker--see leonard Bernstein's Sony recording of excerpts from the ballet to hear what is possible."
2,not impressed,wouldnot order these again not impressed with the product at all. i will spend the money to get the ones from my detist so they actually fit with no fussing around
1,waitingandwaitingandwaiting,if I had known I was ordering directly from China I would have splurged for a more expensive item. a warning that it would take 2 months to arrive would be helpful.
3,"These were hard to use, but worth the price.","I got one of the three to work properly, they are a little tricky to get perfect. Still worth what I paid for them."
4,Brite Bite,"These teeth trays work great. I just use them to brighten my smile every now and again when I feel like my theeth are looking dull because of all the coffee I drink at the office. I tried to do the heat molding (when you dip them in hot water and shape them to your teeth by biting down in them). It doesn't really work, but for what I'm using them for they fine either way. They were so cheap too! I totally recommend this product if your looking for a simple whitening tray."
4,Super Cute!,"i loved the story. though it was predictable, it did manage to keep me glued till the end! loves it!"
5,"Words cannot describe, but I'll try my best...","This thing deserves 10 stars! What more could you want? 3 discs and 3 videos of complete live Metallica concerts! It also has a comprehensive color booklet and a couple other goodies. It's expensive, but trust me, it's worth all the moola. A must for any Metallica fan, diehard or not."
5,The Best compilation of any out!,"This is by far the best essential Metallica you can get! It has great performances, especially the full length Master of Puppets on the video! You don't get to hear the whole thing often, especially Live! This is a must buy!"
5,metallica is back,first of all. metallica changed me and made me into the music loving person i am today and binge and purge helped. my cousin made me watch the vhs' many moons ago and i havent looked back since. all i must say is metallica is one of the greatest bands of all time and will be remembered for years and years after theyre gone. so dont look down on metallica for those few albums (u kno which ones i mean) and buy this. itll change ur life forever. and thank god for death magnetic. it wasnt metallicas fault that they sucked for those few years. bob rock did it. and hopefully by the grace of god he will never EVER produce a metallica album again. they should get flemming rasmussin ( i spelled it wrong) again. u remember him. master of puppets ...and justice for all? yea u kno
2,none,"Such things as The Wall were written and done long before this and was remastered and remixed into breathtaking 5.1 with beautiful picture. Why couldn't they have done it w/this? Oh yea, the Xmas release/we want your money timing (Nov. 12 or something) Keep the vhs."
5,Metallica are rock gods!!!!,"I got this (book/cd/dvd) set as a gift...this is the best set any band has ever put out...Weighing in at three CDs and two dvds, plus a bunch of tour memorabilia, the sheer bulk of Live Sh*t...Binge and Purge scares off anyone but the most devoted fans, which is too bad. Although it is exhausting, this box provides ample proof of the brutal power of Metallica in concert --more than eight hours of live Metallica,The complete original 72-page full-color book is even included on DVD 2,commemorative backstage pass ,it is awe-inspiring. For hardcore fans, Live Sh*t is a godsend.This is an amazing collection of the best of metallica live if you are discovering metallica for the first time( where the hell have you been) this is the best way to see the power of this rock gods. If you are a true fan than you better get...up and get this set.. Metallica Kicks..."
1,Seriously?,"I can't believe a single person gave this more than two stars.First....what plot? You know where this is going as soon as the CIA gets involved with a SPEC OPS team.U.S. Spec OpsCIAMystic LocalNo modern communicationUmmmmm....It took me three nights just to have the patience to watch the whole thing. If it's not free, don't do it."
2,Where's the BEEF?,"I give this movie two stars for realism and good acting. Beyond that there is nothing here. Senseless, undefined, nonsense. Waste of time and money."
2,Nothing to see here... move along,"I wish I had read the reviews for this movie before I lost 90 minutes of my life to it. I gave it two stars, because the production was OK and that saved it from one star. The plot really was fairly meaningless with little to no character development. The latter is a must if you are going to make a drawn out film that really has no ending that ties the whole effort together in some way. Otherwise it is just a bunch of stuff that just happened. So at the end of the day, the ""mystical"", lack-luster ending left me feeling empty and also left me feeling that my time would have been better spent people-watching at the mall for an hour and a half."
3,You have to be open minded for this,"I read the reviews and this maybe a low budget film but its a good movie. I am like most and didnt understand the end well, however this is a folklore premise.You need to look past some of the cheapness. You should give it a try but if you want to nit pick then make your own movie!"
1,Waste of time,I love Si-fi. but this was worse then bad. Lame & boring story & the ending was a huge disappointment. I should have watched paint dry!
1,Extra Lame,What a bad movie a waste of time. No ending. It has a really bad semi sci-fi story if you can call it a story.
2,Yawn...,"This movie was incredibly slow. I fell asleep twice. If you are going to go based on the good reviews, rent it first and decide if you want to buy it. I will do that from now on with these independent films that are rated high. What a let down. The acting was ok, filming was a bit wobbly, and the story was good. What made this real boring was the narration from the main character. They were trying to fill in the blanks. Maybe it would have been worse if they didn't. Overall, I did not like it."
2,The Objective,"The first few scary scenes of this film are intriguing- not extremely scary, but creepy enough that you'll want to know what's happening and why its happening. The team of soldiers sent to the desert are there to figure that out, too. As I watched, I expected that there would be some kind of answer to those questions, but the movie provides very little answers and the ending is pointless.The special effects were pretty good for an indy film, and the acting was also good. Other than that though, there isn't much else good to say about it."
4,An excellent book,"In my view, it's the best compilation about philosophy matters about tort law. It seems to me that this book includes interesting works such as : ""The Practice of Corrective Justice"" by Coleman; Wealth Maximization and Tort Law.."" by Posner; Right, justice and tort law by Wright; Intention in tort law by Finnis, The basis for excluding liability for economic loss in tort law, by Benson; Necessary and sufficient conditions in tort law by Honoré; Contributory negligence.. by Simons; Risk, harm and responsibility by Perry, and so on. Without the slightest doubt if you like the tort law, you should have it."
4,fixed,"This didn't entirely fix my issues with the powerhead, but I have a few more things to check before I rule it out dead! LOL"
3,Cute movie - nice comedy,"Cute and funny, nice entertainment. For nearly all audience. One keeps a nice memory of the film."
2,Strengths and Weaknesses,"A lot of bands are turning this type of sutff out. There is some good writing on this album, but it certainly does not showcase the unmatched musicianship and energy that SCI is about. Why do something that everbody else is doing, when you can do something extremely more moving that no one else can even come close to? There have been good studio albums, eg. ""Born on the Wrong Planet."" However,I don't think that you can successfully argue that this is anywhere in the same league. Don't get this album; see them live!!!"
4,My dog love this!,"Like other Merrick varieties, my dog also loves this brand as well. Ordering was easy and the turn-around time although it was initially quoted at 7-10 days, I received my items in 2 business days! I saved even with shipping compared to my local retailer without having to haul it back to my home."
1,i never got this book,i wish i can say i bought this book but i think there is a mistake because i have never bought this item but i may and then i will rate it
4,French Britney Spears makes fun bouncy music,"I was introduced to this Alizee by a friend at work who said that it sounded like euro-techno. In my opinion, however, I think that this is smooth pop music with more class and humor than Britney Spears or Christina. There is also a lightheartedness to the music and lyrics that become apparent if you understand French. This is highly entertaining, but not a classic. Enjoyable, if you like pop music. However, the CD is very short and is overbefore you know it. The first track ""Moi...Lolita"" is the best on the album."
4,delightful book - brings back a flood of memories,"This book tells the story behind those great and now gone Burma-Shave signs that so many of us remember seeing along the highways from the late 1920's to the early 1960's. When we were kids we read the signs but now it is fun to learn some of the events that took place ""behind the scenes"". Included in the back of the book are all the verses that were used and listed by years. A great gift!"
1,Ruined By Morons,"Minus 5 stars. Want to watch some classic, public domain, mediocre to poor quality un-restored Three Stooges prints completely destroyed by a gang of morons who intermittently slap their ugly, rude, and obnoxious ""Platinum Disc Corporation"" logo onto the corner of the screen? Then this sort of garbage just for you! I suggest avoiding anything from the Platinum Disc Corporation unless you enjoy folks taking a giant crap on historically significant original film art by slapping their self-aggrandizing label on it. The only value here is to see The Three Stooges ruined by production stooges who, evidently, think they are more important than the original material."
5,Fischer-Dieskau's Opera Debut,"These 3CDs document a an historic opera occasion - a live recording of Fischer-Dieskau's opera debut. It is also the Berlin opera debut of Ferenc Fricsay who later made Berlin his musical home. The recording was made in 1948 so allowances need to be made for the sound although it is generally very good, considering the era. Nevertheless, the music is exciting and you quickly get caught up in this dramatic live performance. It is no wonder Dieskau and Fricsay went on to become international musicians. If you are into historic opera then this is definitely for you. I've spent many hours of enjoyment listening to these CDs. Thoroughly recommended."
5,Healing,I chose this book after watching a program on spiritual healing that featured Dr. Mehl-Medrona. I am grieving the loss of my husband and only child and want something other than the western medicine that is practiced with the grieving. This book has been a good start.
4,Could be better,"Must have for any TDF fan. It's not as good as their first two albums WOMM and FBI. It's not the style that's not quite there, it's something about the vibe that's been missing for a while that wasn't recaptured with this album. Family Feud saw a return to that vibe with Chevy's and Everything's Chicken (but the bone) among other tracks. Mostly it's the beats and music that just haven't been as good as when they started in the game. Bootleg and Shoestring display their verbal style just as well as ever.Short disc but worth it for all TDF fans."
2,Found You,I used this productyears ago.Forgot the name and finally foundyou on Amazon.Loved the frangrance and now inmy new smaller home at the edge ofthe woods - I will not have a ringaround the tub from this hard water :)
1,failed product but did receive full refund,The product was NOT what I ordered but I did receive full refund right away and kept the product but have no use for it. Situation completely resolved without problem.
4,Best in the lot.,"I wouldnt say that this is an exceptional title but compared to other books in the market , this is the best. Be aware that this covers 'Product Management' in a very generic fashion. It doesnt talk about the role played by a PM in Software Development Process."
2,Great product if you want to break your new phone...!,"I bought a new SCH8500 and it's fallen out of this holster at least 4 times in the past 2 months! Sure it seems to lock in quite nicely, but as soon as you nudge into something, the phone falls to the ground! My phone is now broken because of this and I'm waiting to recieve a replacement; If they'll even send me a replacement! You can bet I'll buy full leather phone protector when/if I get my new phone back. Do yourself a big fat favor and get a holser that protects the entire phone. All you need to do is drop the phone just once and it's all over...!"
2,Good until it breaks,"I found this to be a good holster though the pictures made it seem thinner than it actualy was. The clip broke off of the holster that I got my girlfriend for her phone, and I first assumed that it was because of rough use. About a mounth later the clip broke off in the same place on mine when the seatbelt in my car pulled on it. This is probibly somthing that could be fixed by the manufacturor, the plastic seems week in that spot, and I'd recommended getting one of the other availible cases for this phone."
1,...,"this is the most disappointing item I have purchase from .... I must say it is flimsy to say the least. The phone has a tendency to drop out of it so be very CAREFUL!! I recommend spending $5-$10 more and get the leather case (which I have) it also allows you to rotate the phone for when you sit. This might seem odd, but the phone will not cut into your stomach while driving."
1,full-on boring,"I admit I'm fascinated by the Mitford sisters and thought I was in for a treat when I finally got around to this.Alas! It's stuffy, densely written, and fails to convey any sense of the magic and wonder of love -- or even of Voltaire's personality!Could also have used some footnotes for those of us who aren't history PhDs."
1,Disappointed ;o(,I order these thinking it would be what i needed for my addis master clipper don't waste your money.. they will not last long at all.. One week they were sliding of my clipper blade..Don't fit the master at all..
5,"If you buy one book this year, buy this one!","No, Anne didn't pay me to say that (although I do accept gratuities!). This book is wonderful, as most of the comments here say. As a lapsed Catholic, it has made me re-examine my own relationship to the church and God. There seems to be a resurgence of faith and religion in America as we approach the millenium, and Anne Lamott captures the struggles of reaching out to the unknown in the age of skepicism/secularism with wit and grace."
1,You already know Anne Lamott...,"She's that girl you knew back in high school who walked around constantly saying, ""I'm so fat,"" despite being skinnier than nine-tenths of the female population and loudly worrying that she was going to get a B on that French test we took yesterday when everyone knew she was going to get an A. This sort of behavior is nauseating enough in teenagers; in a middle-aged woman, it makes for bad memoirs.Her treatment of Christianity is so superficial in these pages as to be insulting to those of us who believe that God is something other than a Santa Claus who dispenses wishes. This book has little to do with faith; it's mostly a compilation of how the world has somehow wronged Anne Lamott. Perhaps some people find her privileged whine amusing, and I might have looked more kindly on the book if it didn't purport to be about ""faith."" But there are better memoirs by bulimics out there, and Anne Lamott's sophomoric ""humor"" gets on my nerves."
1,"I misssed it, too!--and I'm an Enlish lit prof","I hold a PhD in English lit from Cornell and teach same, and I concur with the reviewer who ""missed it"" There's nothing here readers except an author who has been spoiled by herd-frenzy mentality. It's time to wake up and call ego-centric, self-indulgent writing exactly what it is. Save your money! (I gave this book one-star because there was nothing less.)"
5,La Hot Lamott,"I...have read very few religious books that I could feel comfortable giving to a friend. Nonetheless, I found this book so meaingful that I convinced our Thursday morning book club to read it. Once a week, we'd discuss one chapter. Our group has become somewhat of a therapy session without laying out $100 every thursday. Ann would probably be glad to know that her stories of brokeness, faith, doubt, depravity and salvation sustained our little group for over a half a year, wherein we shared our own brokeness, faith, etc. We are still meeting, but now we are trying to figure out the next step from Travelling Mercies. In the meantime, we're perusing the Gospel of St John. Ann Lamott challenges the notion that Christians are conservative, stuffy, prudish, and humorless. A great book for the believer and doubter alike."
4,A Great and Pleasant Read,"From the start to the end, Anne Lamott's writing is greatly captivating and keeps her readers guessing as to what she's getting at, then leaves us with great philosophical insight, all the while keeping her humorous input she's so famous for.Although she writes with freedom and confidence, some of her ideas about ""faith"" may not be what most people expect, but then again, these are her own thoughts about faith, what she's gone through and how she has come to be the person she is today.She carries along a great novel, somewhat of an autobiography with her son Sam, and warmly welcomes any readers willing to read to the very end. Lots of great quotations to write down; a definite read for anyone."
5,More great insights into life,"If you liked Bird by Bird and Operating Instructions, you'll like Traveling Mercies, too. I have to admit, I am a bit disappointed that I have read some portions of the book before, in the form of columns for online magazine Salon. That is only because I read them so hungrily online that I selfishly wanted all-new material here.Lamott captures a moment or sensation so perfectly that you may wonder why no writer has ever described it that way before. If you don't agree with Lamott's politics, I like to think you can still admire her technical prowess as a writer (I guess that is easy to say when you do agree with her more often than not).Even though I have to admit that my life seems nothing like Lamott's on the surface, I find it comforting that we all seem to find ourselves seeking for answers to the same problems. Lamott's anxieties and celebrations mirror those of many people, and her unique way of expressing them connect us all."
3,"Entertaining, fast read, not enough substance","I found the book entertaining--laughed at parts, agreed with parts, but not very thought-provoking. I was particularly annoyed with the author's easy dismissal of the role of fatherhood in her son's life. Men don't seem to be too important to Ms. Lamott, as she goes through them like tissues. I did enjoy her style of writing, however, and I like her sense of humor. I find that many people struggling with their faith are self-absorbed and hypocritical, and Ms. Lamott's book has not disappointed me in that regard."
5,Favorite book? I think so.,"All my friends loved Anne Lamott before I knew who she was. As soon as I read Traveling Mercies, I was hooked. I've read much of her work since and I've much enjoyed the journey. This is a great place to start."
1,Wish Fulfillment,"This book is about the need to believe. If you want something badly enough you can convince yourself of almost anything. For example her experience after getting an abortion was an example. She had to find some kind of meaning to it so out of a deep wish, she convinced herself she was feeling the presence of Christ. I was in the hospital myself faced with death. Jesus wasn't there for me. I prayed and all I felt was coldness. For every Anne Lamott out there, there is a person like myself, and if that is true; is it that Jesus is only interested in half the people that need him? I don't think so I think it's nothing but fantasy. In other words it is a bunch of head tripping nonsense."
1,Self-Indulgent,"This book was a bookclub book for me and I had no preconceived notion or really any idea of what it was about. From the start, I found the writing style frenetic and almost stream of consciouness-like and very hard to follow. When I adjusted to the writing style enough to focus on the content I was more disappointed as I found it to be a self-absorbed account of someone's individuals journey with very little in the form of a messesge or inspiration. Very rarely do I read a book that has little or no value or impact for me, I would rate this one at a negative impact. perhaps I just speak another language and others will find it helpful or interesting, hope so."
5,A realistic journey of the Christian faith,"I was introduced to this book by my spiritual director and once I picked it up, I could not put it down. I appreciated Ms. Lamott's incredible honesty and her ability to weave her life experiences into lessons about God and faith. For some, her journey may be shocking but it speaks to a reality of experience that is attractive in its unvarnished approach."
3,English Lush,"I bought this album for the song ""Everybody Cries,"" but the rest of this album sounds so similar I had to refer to the case to know what song was what. I like ""Jumpin'"" which was the one standout. This is a minor blip on this album (beside ""Everyboy Cries"") that it is noteworthy in that the song has a catchy beat, but the others are so interchangeable that there little difference."
4,"fun, pop, dance brings out the Disco Child in you","My sexual preferance is streight, but i'm a DJ/MC i like to dance, girls with GLITZ, and i am ashamed to admit i like smooth disco dance sounds, and i like to mix-up my music with new sounds, So if you can admit to your audio perversion, like me, it is not great art but it is fun. so grab that foxy lady hit the floor,bounce it,bump your stuff, swing your load, is's ok to have some fun, really, you only go this way once, it's your dance...you do it! fun='s no hang ups. that said, enjoy Liberty X's smooth dance sounds."
5,BUY IT!,"Do you want to sell your book? If so... stop with the hesitation, and read no further: BUY IT!Monroe MannFounder/PresidentUnstoppable Actors"
1,Not Specific Inferior,"I purchased both this book and John Kremer's 1001 Ways to Market Your Book. Kremer's book is far superior, far more thorough, and far more practical for self-publish authors. Buy Kremer's book and save your time and money. I don't recommend Guerrilla Marketing for Writers."
3,"Although it has some flaws, it&#65533;ll make for great dinner conv","I have two boys, ages 9 and 15. Although neither of them wanted to read Guns, Germs, and Steel, my reading of it has led to some interesting conversations in our family. The book gives a good background to history in many parts of the world that I was not as familiar with as I should have been. As I`ve read the book, I've summarized his claims for my kids. It has led us to good discussions about the people that we have replaced on this continent, to question the concepts of race and intelligence, and to wonder just how white Europeans, who could certainly be savage and stupid themselves, came to conquer most of the world. Although I think that many of the author's claims are a bit too strong, it is still a thought-provoking book.For a more complete review of the book, I'd have to agree with the weaknesses mentioned by Christopher Smith in a review on this website posted on Jan. 24, 2001."
3,Mis information aboutr crops,"I've read some of the negative reviews and would like to say something about a repeating assertion that the Incas only had two crops, potatos and maize (corn). The Incas cultivated around seventy crops, including grains, beans and fruits. More, in fact, than any other region in the world. Their conquerers were only interested in a few of them and those are the ones we know about. Among the better known crops are lima beans, peppers, peanuts, sweet potatos, squash, quinoa and tomatoes. Salsa is an Incan original. There are also reviewers who claim the natives of Mexico grew mostly maize. Their agriculture was pretty diverse too."
3,"A tough read, but worth the time.","If this book had been easier to read, I would have rated it much higher. I have had little exposure in my reading regarding theories as to why one culture developed ahead of another. Guns, Germs, and Steel takes a good run at it. I found the author provocative, stimulating, etc., as it helped me look at our world in a new way. This book, however, is not an easy read, and definitely takes concentration. Read it when you are most alert."
4,A good listen,I heard about this book and decided to buy the audio version. It is interesting and has merit though it does not always consider the impace of individual military leaders on engagement and campaigns. He feels that germs have won more battles for a victor than any other factor; not true but good field sanitiation did help you more soldiers in the battle. It does explain the effect of disease developed from lifestock handling and main band of influence in world.
2,"Good book, but don't buy Kindle edition","Very interesting read, but the kindle edition is disappointing as it lacks images, maps and the tables are poorly formatted.I think this information should be highlighted on the [Kindle Edition] page. As the price is almost the same as thepaperback edition (5 cents today), you would think you were buying an equivalent product..."
4,"Good answers to ""Yali's Question""","The idealists among us might wonder, if one civilization is so much more advanced than another, why couldn't that advanced civilization ""live and let live?"" Why did the Europeans have to basically embark on a policy of extermination of the indigenous people in America, why did they have to do the same thing in Australia, and so on. The author cites other instances, for instance, the Maori of Polynesia simply wiped out or enslaved another tribe, the Moriori, who must have been the ""give-peace-a-chance"" hippies of the 1830s. That sort of question appears to be out of scope for Diamond, and I feel he could have at least commented on it....For my complete review of this book and for other book and moviereviews, please visit my site [...]Brian WrightCopyright 2008"
1,"wordy, wordy, wordy","The book is tedious, full of extra words, and asks the reader to many questions which makes the writer sound condescending."
2,Mediocre and suspicion-forming,"Mediocre attempt - does not seem to fulfill authors stated intent or that of the title. Wanders into apologetic ramblings about race and creed, largely without advancing any evidence for his reasoning - only statistically unsupported ideas. Prologue of book instantly made me suspicious of possible scholarly dishonesty and the following chapters did nothing to allieve me of this concern. I finished the book, I feel, about as knowledgeable as I began it - the information may as well not have been read because I cannot consider it as trustworthy, and must discard most of it outright."
3,Inverted racism (2nd part),"Jared Diamond has made friend with a Papoo named Yali. He has found him intelligent and well educated - which is not surprising. He concludes that Papoos ""are on the average,more intelligent, more expressive and more interested in things than the average European or American"". Of course, that is not racism. A crucial proof is given : Papoos are more able than Whites to find their way in the jungle. If they have not yet made a space shuttle, nor conquered China, the fault is in their bad environment. From our modest point of view, we say that, by chance, all peoples on the Earth are not as passive or devoid of imagination as Papoos. If Diamond had spent a few days visiting the French countryside, he would have seen that an environment has to be worked upon, it has to be dressed, to be reclaimed, to be irrigated ...."
2,Like in college,"As a student of history and not anthropology I have to say that this book had well discussed thoughts as to the why, where and how civilizations occurred, grew, and ultimately flourished around the world. This book ultimately takes fundamental ideas which are simple to understand and by the time you are finished you are overwhelmed by the simplicity of both the arguments and the arguer.My issue is not with the text but with the delivery. One of the most difficult tasks is to try to make statistics, facts, and concepts such as discussed in this text interesting.This book neither compels the reader to continue to research this subject, nor come up with their own ideas. It is what it is, a text which provides facts but little by the way of enjoyment."
5,Insightful and exciting,"This book altered the way I think about history. It synthesizes a wide variety of information, some of which was familiar to me but was presented in a new light, into a coherent vision of how the world works.Furthermore, in those areas where I have some knowledge, such as linguistics and the history of writing, Diamond does well--I am therefore inclined to trust him on matters closer to his field of expertise as a biologist.So yes, some reviewers are in a spilkas because he concentrates on some factors at the expense of others (though several argue against strawmen instead of the actual book). You show me a book where every statement is guarded and balanced with qualifications and hedges, and I'll show you a dull-as-ditchwater textbook."
3,"Some parts good, some parts absurd","JD destroys his credibility as a scientist at the beginning of the book when he dismisses hundreds of empirical studies on race and intelligence as flawed, and refutes them all because the New Guineans ""seem smarter"" to him than other races. Any high school student would be repulsed by such an unscientific method.JD does redeem himself in the remainder of the book with an interesting historical-macroeconomic view of the world. It's a great survey of homo sapiens, especially between 12,000BC - 1AD. I don't agree with his thesis (hard work doesn't matter... just go live in the right climate and you'll be rich!), but picked up a lot of neat facts and I would recommend the book.Other gripes: I could not comprehend the pictures of New Guinean men in the book. Also, JD could have left out an adjective from each sentence in the book without harming the text one bit."
5,Fascinating Refutation of Racial Superiority,"Diamond provides an eminently readable, interesting and convincing explanation of why civilizations developed where they did. A very worthwhile read for anyone interested in the origins of societies."
5,Amazing insight!,"This book is the most captivating book on science and discovery that I have ever read. For those willing to approach it with an open mind, it can change the way you see race, history, and destiny. I can't recommend this more highly. The story begins with the author being asked a simple question and spirals into a thought-provoking and ground-breaking view of world history. Why do some peoples and nations have all the wealth? All the food? Why have other societies been shackled with poverty? Why have some societies seemed to have been given the short end of the stick by fate? Could it be race? Or is it something a bit simpler, something most of us would fail to ever consider? It is wonderful to read a book and feel your world view changing in the process."
3,repetitive,AFter reading the first 50 pages I can already say I am thoroughly bored. Nothing has been brought up thats seems significantly new or interesting. He spends pages upon pages simply repeating the same analysis over and over. This is the second book that I have read and again I see the same defects in his writing style. It seems as if he could have written this with half the pages that he currently uses. Any decent editor should have realized this and toned down the repitition. OTher times his analysis is absent in total because of the way he structures the book. He seperates the facts too far from the analysis. This is good for organization but again leads to extreme boredom and disinterest.
4,Well researched,"In this Pulitzer Prize winning book, Diamond attempts to answer the question of why the Western Civilization rose to power instead of other civilizations. His answer is that they lucked out on geography and ecology. Western civilizations were better able to domesticate animals and plants due to the varieties that they had available, and were therefore able to develop larger farming societies, allowing for development of crafts and ""scientific exploration."" Also, because they were in larger groups, they were exposed at low levels to many germs, and developed immunity. Because of these factors, they were able to harness the power of guns, germs, and steel in their pursuit of world power. This was a fascinating book, and definitely worth reading even after watching the documentary. It's just packed full of information, the writing is smooth and articulate, and the research is extensive."
3,"yeah, yeah, yeah...","Outside of the tedious repetition and somewhat pedantic style of writing, my primary issues with this book are: 1) Almost flippant references to anthropology and anthropological theory. Diamond makes it sound as it cultural anthropology is a transparent and non-complicated discipline (one need not even be educated in anthropology to write a best-selling book on the subject.) This is a familiar - in my opinion - mistaken view of professionals in the ""hard sciences."" 2) I disagree with the views that Diamond articulates in the final chapter - that history should (let alone can) become a science, and that this will enable people to make a better future. My opinion is that to successfully challenge racism require a change in the terms of the debate - which may mean getting away from ""scientific"" thinking altogether."
1,I HATE YOU AMAZON,"Man. I was waiting weeks for the hardcover edition to come into stock so I just decided to buy the paperback. Then, right after I order, the hardcover comes in stock. I HATE FREAKIN AMAZON. AAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH"
3,Not worth the money.,"Mr. Diamond does not tell us anything new. Throughout the book he keeps repeating himself over and over again. I read it, because I bought it."
5,An excellent and insightful work.,"I'll try not to be a blowhard by unnecessarily recapitulating the views expressed by other reviewers. In short, the book presents a logical and reasonable thesis and backs it up very well. The objections of other reviewers are nothing more than quibbles; yes, there may be some situations where other variables take precedence over those listed as primary in the book, but the conceptual framework laid out by Dr. Diamond is an extremely useful model that successful explains most of the large scale variation seen. An old scientific adage is ""All models are wrong, but some are more useful than others."" While Dr. Diamond's model certainly isn't infallible, it seems to be the best model availible by a wide margin."
4,Wordy but worth it,"When a friend of mine said he had read this book, it sounde really compelling. But in the end, it's mostly a scientific treatise about how people developed. Not that that is bad -- but it won't be coming out as a movie anytime soon.I'm glad I read it but it could have made its points in half the pages."
2,"Politically correct, otherwise completely incorrect","Flaws everywhere. He calls the European Union ECC in 1997. What kind of historician is who does not know the Mastrich Treaty? In 1992 the ECC was renamed to EU, EUROPEAN UNION. He refers the ECC (the EU) as the tiniest and unsuccessful move for a united Europe, such <<tiniest>> move, for example, is the Euro, the European currency adopted by 12 members states. Lovely!"
5,The tie that binds,"Diamond binds the story of mankind that we read in the fossil record to biological and ecological problems of today, and in between provides insight into how and why culture developed as it did. A book for everyone interested in the forces that shape our society."
3,Fairly good,"Good overall, but I have several problems.I have seen his central points made years ago, in books such as Plagues and Peoples by William McNeill and The European Miracle by Eric Jones. I know it is not an academic text, but more credit in the body of the text was owed to the people who ACTUALLY invented the theories he is using.Lacks scientific detachment. Obviously lets his emotions get in the way of his logic. Westerners are the only ones eligible for criticism or anger, even if others would qualify for some of the same criticisms.Finaly, he covers too much ground. This needed to be a much larger work and to use some of his own ORIGINAL research rather than the cut and paste job he did on others books."
4,Interesting well developed thesis.,"I just finished reading the book and found it well written and thought-provoking. Each chapter is laid out in well-organized manner and the narrative flows nicely from start to finish. The material has the potential to be very dry, yet the author manages to sustain reader interest throughout the book.While readers will doubtlessly disagree with many of the ideas that the author puts forth, they are presented with great clarity and style. Like any well-written book, ""Guns, Germs and Steel"" stimulates reflection upon the nature of mankind and the development of societies around the world."
3,"Not bad, but Landes' Wealth & Poverty of Nations is better","Diamond answers the standard question: why is the West rich? His answer, in short, is geography. Well, maybe. He does admit that geography shapes culture, but culture also makes a huge difference in what people *do* with geography's endowments. For my money, which I spent, David Landes' ""The Wealth and Poverty of Nations"" is a better take on the same question. Landes focuses on culture; he admits that geography plays a role (he's not as monocausal as Diamond) but emphasizes cultural traits over geography because, well, they matter more. Best statistic: the GDP of the 30 million overseas chinese exceeds that of the entire People's Republic of China. Why? The overseas chinese -- who thrive everywhere -- have a culture of thrift and hard work. The PRC Chinese have a culture of sucking up to the authorites. That's changing now, of course, but the point holds."
5,Literacy and Logograms,May I just say this - look at how many people have reviewed this book and look at the stir of reviews: truly a success. Experience it.I will add that there is a wonderful section on literacy (Chapter 12: Blueprints and Borrowed Letters) and if you like literacy and logograms for a read this chapter is worth the purchase alone.
3,A great new look at history,"Still working my way though this book. The writing is a touch dry at times, but the content is worth the small amount of effort required."
1,"Great book, Kindle edition is mising important content","Diamond's work should be, but this edition is not acceptable as, a contentious college textbook. There is no excuse for an e-book version lacking printed version content. None. If the e-book version cannot secure the illustration rights, then clearly say so, and drop the price. Otherwise, do not publish. Clearly, anyone can scan the missing content, and make the pirate version worth more then the official.This e-book version lacks pages, illustrations, and an index. The cover is skewed. There is no notice of the missing content or the flaws, before you buy. DON'T BUY this version. GET A DRM-FREE VERSION, AND STIFF THE PUBLISHER. Buy the author a lunch, via pay-pal or a charity of his choosing.DO NOT BUY THIS E-BOOK."
3,Dense but Interesting,"This book is dense and repetitive, but presents some very interesting information."
3,Disappointing,"Given how much I'd heard about this book, I was surprised at how little it had to offer. Yes, he does tie together some important ideas about how civilizations develop, but the author is clear from the start that the purpose of the book is to argue that poverty is not the fault of the impoverished, and wealth isn't a reflection on the merits of the wealthy. This is a point that he returns to so often that it becomes tiresome. Any explanation of historical development that actually looks at the qualities of the players involved rather than at their good or bad fortune is dismissed offhandedly. This is a political commitment that requires him to overplay factors in human development like geography. The book is worth reading, but largely to show how academic presuppositions can get in the way of good research."
3,too long,"This book REALLY needs an editor. It is just too long. Mr. Diamond goes over the same points over and over in excruciating detail. My solution was just to skip paragraphs detailing exactly how to carbon-date pinecones for the 20th time.That said, the book is good. How domestic plants and animals came to be is very interesting. Why some cultures ended up with firearms, books, ships, and deadly germs is very interesting. The counter-arguement that some races are just smarter than others is a silly straw-man. No one who could read at this level seriously would think along those outmoded racist lines."
3,Good book when taken in context,"It's a very good book; and I think that it adds a piece to the puzzle as to why European culture dominated for hundreds of years. Diamond's flaw is that he neglects a few major events that occured which also pushed Europe along this path:-The Islamic world's regression into religious extremism after the Crusades caused it to lose ground technologically.-The Renaissance in Europe (which also was a direct result of the Crusades) helped increase trade in Europe which caused it to gain ground technologically-The fact that China made a conscience decision to withdraw into isolation caused it to lose ground technologicallyI think that Guns, Germs, & Steel is a great book in two regards: It shows that geography played a larger part in shaping history that most of us thought; and I think it does a very good job in demonstrating that all races are equally intelligent.That said, his attempt to broadly explain the entire course of history is a little short-sighted."
1,Dreadful,"Let me start by saying I have studied anthropology, forensics, anatomy and entomology. When I picked this book off the shelf I said ""Now, this is the book for me!"" From the first page, I found it to be the most boring, repetivive and predictable read I have ever experienced. I had more fun reading undergrad papers about moth pheromones. As some other reviewers mentioned, the author seems to put ""stone-age"" cultures on a pedestal as he tries to make Westerners feel bad for existing. Not really what I was hoping to get from this read. I actually fell asleep numerous times, trying to trudge through this. Hey, if you want bo believe the 5 start reviews, knock yourself out. I would sell the book, used but it's currently acting as a kickstand pad for my motorcycle..."
2,Disppointing,"We listened to the audio CD version of this book and it was a disappointment. The reader's voice was grating and often distracted from the story. But the story was overlong as well, and there were many times a point could have been made more succinctly. The author is a well known scientist, but this attempt to communicate with a broader audience generally failed becuase of its presentation and the flabbiness of the writing rather than because of its content."
1,Garbage of the worst kind!,"...The author claims that the savages of New Guinea are mentally superior to those of Western Europe.Need I say more about this book for absolute sheer nonsense. This is a racist book of the worst kind but its racism is against the white people.The agenda is to claim that the blacks and their derivatives are superior! WHITES ARE INFERIOR! ...This is not research but propaganda! Respectfully submitted,Pierre Rinfret"
2,A blatant lie to make liberals feel good.,"It is a very well written but still cheap propaganda for a politically correct view of the world. A very complicated and truncated system of lies and deceptions to make non-white races feel good about themselves. To explain away their strikingly minimal contribution to the modern world.Sorry folks, the reason why the Romans (out of dozens of similar Latin tribes) eventually ruled the world has very little to do with geography. It has a lot to do with their moral strength, piousness, courage, patriotism, altruism, curiosity, hard work and genetically determined intelligence and other well known virtues that make a person or a people great.This book is a dangerous lie because instead of helping societies overcome their shortcomings it gives easy excuses for their misery."
4,Excellent for non-technical reading,"While it is difficult for me to give an very high rating for a book that doesn't present its source material well, I must say that this book presents a very compelling theory in a clear and concise way for laypersons such as myself. As an undergraduate five years ago studying the history of Africa, I pored over pages and pages of articles regarding the Bantu population expansion and came away with no clue of its significance. This book cleared that up in a matter of minutes. Anyone who has wondered why civilizations have had different paths of development should definitely read this book. Anyone foolish enough to think that genetic or racial factors were decisive had better read this book and then face the challenge of refuting its primary argument."
2,"good book, wrong format","I loved listening to this book on tape. It was like attending an Anthro.101 class taught by a brilliant instructor. Unfortunately, the vendor from whom I ordered this book as a gift for friend who spends much time in the car, sent a print version instead of the audio version he listed. In print, the book is more difficult - I never made it past the third chapter. I highly recommend the audio book, just beware of getting the wrong format."
4,Good Synthesis but Incomplete,The book had a good synthesis of the physical factors that shaped early history of mankind. It is incomplete because it doesn't factor in the effects of culture. It also has a blind spot that totally dismisses the effects of IQ - an approach that is politically correct but not correct in reality.
5,Jared Diamond explains the world for you . . .,"Diamond's exhaustive but riveting work explains the core question of human history: Why did the Europeans end up running the world show while darker folks on other land masses seem to have been much less successful? According to Diamond's theories--solidly researched and fully plausible--the confluence of random factors of botany, zoology, and geography made the difference. Absolutely fascinating."
4,"Healed by faith, our own or others?",Thought-provoking play but the format of monologues gathered together may make for wordiness and challenging presentation. I'm glad I read it.
4,Awesome CD!,This Pearl Jam CD is an awesome collection of their Greatest Hits! Too bad these guys arent still cranking out the hits!!
4,good but...,"Okay fans don't shoot me. I was a fan of Pearl Jam when they first came out with 'Ten' and 'Vs', however, they lost me. I started finding them pretentious and preachy so I just lost interest. However, I was interested when I heard they had released a Greatest Hits package.First, the positives...every track is a winner (I don't even mind their version of 'Last Kiss' even though i HATED it on the radio). The album is very reasonably priced and has a s$#t load of music on it. My only real criticism I have that made me give it four stars instead of five is the overwhelming number of tracks from the first two albums (that anyone even remotely interested in PJ must already own). I was really hoping for more tracks from their later albums that I am less familiar with. However, the tracks that are included are wonderful and I probably will get more of their later albums because of them.New favourite - 'Man of the Hour'."

1,Its over... finally!!,"A greatest hits album from pearl jam , probably means the end of grunge for good! Thank god! This music is good for acne-clad teenagers with severe inferiority complexes...."
4,Pearl Jam fans will love this,"There are some great songs here, for the true fans of the band, I highly recommend it. I bought this after seeing the documentary Pearl Jam 20 because it reminded me of the great songs I had not listened to in a long time."
3,Greatest Hits?,"What kind of Pearl Jam fan doesn't already have these songs. Way too hard to pick a PJ greatest hits as fans all have their own favorites. I guess could be a good gift for someone who hasn't discovered this amazing band. You're better off buying them a ticket to see them live instead, or at least one of their live albums."
2,Generic Creed Rip-off clone.,"I give Pearl Jam 2 stars.. why? Well they didn't become good unti recently, and they didn't help invent grunge.Creed invented grunge, millions are trying to copy their formula.For a good greatest hits, get Creed."
1,Questionable quality,I am not sure what they sent me. It does not taste or work like the coca tea I have had in the past.
4,Worthy buy,"It's good enough for me to order volume 2 after having this for a few months. It's the arcade versions of some good oldies. So if u want some good old games to kick around with your friends in 2 player mode and having endless continues to win every time, you are in the right place. To be fair, about half of the games i don't play at all, and were boring the one time i did play them. However, the other half... worth the money easily."
1,DO NOT BUY,Bought in 2008 for my boat. This is a sailboat so no loud music. Both speakers blow out this weekend. Had a cheap set of speakers before that lasted 7 years.Peace of junk
1,bad choice,I own 3set of these and all three went bad in less than 2 years-they came with the boat I bought.
5,Wow!,"I have never uttered or written the words ""everyone should hear this album"" until just this moment. And I mean it. I'm sure a lot of people have heard the edited ""Suicide"" on the radio, but that's just the tip of the iceberg. Mr. Gaylor's stories and observations are alternately hilarious and horrifying (sometimes both at the same time), and the music and sound effects are amazing. I've never heard an album like this. It's one of a kind, and I can't recommend it highly enough."
2,It's not coming from the heart,Leann Rimes is one of the best singers of young women country singers but this is just a big mess this album. What you are hearing is spares off of her other albums that never made the final cut. Who really wants to hear those songs from artists. Curb records put this one together Leann Rimes had nothing to do with it. The single and title track I need you is really good and they sell the single out there of that and thats really all worth buying. Her next album will be better all of her fans know that.
3,I hate to say this but...,"I hate to say this but...This isn't at all what I expected. I bought this CD in hopes of hearing a powerfull collection of NEW songs that would showcase Leann's voice and have me dancing. However, this CD has very few uptempo songs and half of them have been released already! From Jesus the Miniseries, Coyote Ugly Soundtrack, and Aida comes the majority of this CD. If you don't own any of these titles already, then this is a good collection. However, the new songs, though okay, are nothing special. I hope Leann plans to release a NEW CD sometime soon where she will write more songs and have more upbeat songs. I love Leann's voice and I think she is moving in the right direction, but this CD left me feeling Blue."
2,This Is A Horrible CD!,"Okay, I admit she went a little too ... when she recorded her self titled record,with all of those old songs on it. But this time she's gone the opposite direction,I couldn't even reognize her lovely voice on not one but any of the songs. If you like Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera like most kids my age do go ahead and buy it,but if you like good old country,like me, BUYER BEWARE!!"
4,pretty good but sure not country,"I've read on her website and in the paper that LeAnn Rimes didn't authorize this album but that Curb put it together without her input. That may be, I don't know, but it is pretty decent to listen to for a pop album. I'd say buy it on those grounds but don't expect any country sound to it."
3,Relaxing Ballads.,"This album is nohing out of the ordinary, especially for someone as talented as LeAnn.But there are many relaxing and soothing ballads which work like a charm,especially after a long,hard day."
2,I Need You,"Just wanted to express my disappointment of hearing LeAnn Rimes performing on this CD. If you are interested in Country Music this record CD is no where near Country in my way of thinking.If I would have done my homework I would have never bought this CD as it reflects (No Country Music) although her singing is good for those of the people that appreciate this type of music of which I fail to find a Genre that fits is classification, certainly not Country Music. I hope LeAnn Rimes wakes up and returns to Country Music before she loses all of her country roots.I was most disappointed in this CD. Not my type at all. Maybe this is her passing fancy, I certainly hope so."
4,"Strange, ain't it?","It is so awkward...the girl releases what is one of the biggest selling albums of the year 2001 and still she wants to point out it is something which was not intentional, that dad and her record company decided for this work to be on the market.In all honesty..i wish Leann was this wishy-washy all the time if these are the results!The album boasts a couple of songs by the Coyote Ugly soundtrack, including CAN'T FIGHT THE MOONLIGHT that has become he signature song so far.Both the tracks are penned by Diane Warren, no wonder.Diane also signs SOON, another soundtrack tune this time off Stallone's Driven.To me, the best tracks on the album are ONE OF THESE DAYS and the titletrack.Also cute is the I BELIEVE IN YOU.Something that just don't fit here, but certainly puts a feather in her cap, is Lean's duetting with Sir Elton John on the Broadway smash hit Aida's love theme.May sound out of place, but definitely shows the girl's growing up."
5,One of the best writers ever,I loved this book from the first page to the last. Christopher Morley is such a good writer and what a shame he is not revered more. The Haunted Bookshop is the book after this and just as good.
3,Does NOT have the David Bowie narrative!!!,"I would have given this 5 stars instead of 3, since this is one of the most desirable Christmas Specials for me to watchon Christmas Eve, but Amazon incorrectly advertises it as the David Bowie version. I've been looking everywhere for the David Bowie version and ended up buying this version twice, due to Amazon incorrectly labeling this!"
1,Where's David Bowie?,"This DVD of The Snowman was advertised as David Bowie, narrator. He does not appear on this DVD. I was very disappointed! This is an example of false advertising. I have been a loyal customer at Amazon for many years, I ordered this version especially because it claimed to have David Bowie as narrator."
3,Gorgeous score,"Between my mum & me, we got two copies of this at Christmas. I bought one for my mum, and my dad bought one for my mum. Talk about communication! Mum took the ones with the extras, and I got the bare bones edition, with Father Christmas on the same disc.I barely remember this from when I was young. I guess I knew it more from the score, and the infamous ""Walking In The Air"" track. It also got a revival recently in the UK with a spoof advert, advertising a popular (but disgusting) Scottish drink. Bleurgh!I just didn't enjoy it as much as my parents seemed to. I found it incredibly boring, and I forgot there's literally no voices in it. (Apart from a peroxide blonde David Bowie introducing it at the start.) The score definitely makes it up for me. It's an excellent score, and actually made me feel Christmassy. Always good!It's definitely a must have film, but I'd prefer to watch it if I was about 15 years younger. These things just don't hold the same magic for me anymore."
1,HORRIBLE. RIP OFF. BEWARE.,"Bag of cheap parts. Nothing more. Total scam, ripoff. If you sell a car and it's assembled in the picture, you don't send the buyer a box of car parts.BEWARE."
4,A kid's view,"well i'm a kid so what do i know. i liked this movie since i was little (I'm almost 9), and i have asked my Mom to put it on my Christmas list as a last minute gift. I absolutely love this movie. I rated it 4 stars because I don't like all of the songs, but I really like most of them."
3,"Fun for children, entertaining for parents","I took my child to see the Recess movie this past weekend. We've watched the show together now and again, thus the characters were familiar to us both. While the plot moved right along and was for the children, there were lots of inside jokes, pop culture references and a killer soundtrack with songs from the late 1960's/early 1970's that made the movie entertaining for adults. Obviously the makers of the film targeted the later points to the parents whose children would want to see the movie - so that we would having something to enjoy as well. Make sure you stay for the credits - including the trippy version of ""Green Tamborine""."
5,Great Item,My sons love this. They recommend this to all other kids to watch. Our whole family likes this. Great Item.
4,A feel good movie,"Recess is a movie that children and parents alike will love. Children because of the story-line and humor, and parents because of the memories it brings back. With a plot worthy of viewing, and techers we can all relate to... this one will go into my DVD library as soon as it's released!"
5,Completely Riveting.,"Highly innovative and unusual prose. The author has such a genuinely unique and vivid style that the book begs to be absorbed in a single sitting. Very fresh, authentic, and almost photographically realistic. I understand Broekhuizen has additional works pending - I can't wait. This is great stuff!"
1,ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZz,"This was the worst MZB book I have ever attempted to read. Attempt is the key word, since it was so boring I never finished. I didn't care about the characters or understand what motivated them. Perhaps I'll try it again one day, since I absolutely loved The Mists of Avalon, The Firebrand, and the Darkover novels."
4,Quite unexpected...,"but not altogether unpleasent! MZB had me somwhat confused by her choice to enter phrases such as 'hell' and 'the devil' into a book that I had assumed was set in a pre-Christian time. Her choice of names for the characters also was a bit of a jumble. In each family parents would name their children some combination of the names of their father and mother. Until I was familiarized with the characters I had a bit of a hard time keeping track. The Fall of Atlantis was a fast read and I found it easy to sit down and read 150 pages without tiring of the book. If you want a story of Atlantis, this is not for you, Atlantis isn't a setting until the last 50 pages or so. However, if you're looking for a quick book with a unique community setting and somewhat unusual characters, give Atlantis a try."
5,Get away from it all fantasy,"Absorbing story, excellent for a summer's day. Unfortunately the paperback fell apart in my hand after the first ten pages, very poor binding."
2,BUYER BEWARE,"I was very disapointed with THE FALL OF ATLANTIS, as I was expecting one of Bradley's Historical Fiction novels along the lines of her Avalon series, or The Firebrand. I thought the plot was weak and uninspiring."
3,"not bad, but extremely disturbing","This book was well written and had intriguing characters, but it gave me nightmares. If demon worship, pagan rites, and the usual light against dark struggle are your thing, then by all means read this book. Otherwise, stay away! It probably didn't help that I read this book while sick with the flu."
2,puzzle quest: challenge of the warlords,wasn't what I thought it was going to be. looking for something like 7 wonders of the world.
4,Good Game but lots to remember,"I recently purchased this game and find it very entertaining. I am still however trying to remember all of the details necessary in winning the battles. I like the adventure with the ""Bejeweled battles"" rather than playing the ""Bejeweled"" by itself which to me gets a bit boring. I'm glad they had a help button so you can remind yourself of what all the spells and different colors mean. I'm glad I bought this one!"
5,One Terrific Lens,"I own the Sigma 14mm F/2.8 in a Nikon mount, and it is quite fantastic on my D600. I'm surprised that Sigma no longer makes this prime, especially considering how Nikon and Canon are creating lower cost full frame cameras these days. Bokeh isn't something that I would expect from a wide angle lens, but this lens has this magical ability to create smooth and pleasing bokeh when shot wide open. None of my other wide lenses can do this, not my Tokina 16-28 or my Nikon 17-35. And it's crazy sharp when stopped down just a tad. This is definitely a specialty lens that I will pull out when I am feeling inspired. With careful framing, distortion is also very well controlled, though never exempt from any wide angle lens. If you are even considering the Nikon 14-24, I would recommend that you try this lens first."
3,yea yea,it was a good book but i thought it could have gotton to the action a little bit earlier in the book
3,The wierdoes go to Birmingham,"I think it suck big time tell me about it but, I recouen I like it a little. I thank what made the book good was Bryon he made a big inflence. And if he was not in there the book would not be werth reading. Also if I were you I would read this book. What made me want to read it was the front cover."
3,Marginal.,"Tihs book is really not that great. It is crude for no reason, and it has a ridiculously unclear ending.The best aspects of this book are the humor and the message.I would give it only a marginal recommendation."
3,The Watson go to Birmingham,"I think this was a prety good book it was funny espescially when Byron was talking to Larry Dunn with his deaf language. It to was a very interesting book especially when the watson family got to birmingham and when Kenny went to coillers bay and saw the whool pool,but this book was sad and scary when the church blew up but overall this was a good book."
4,A great book for all ages,"The Watsons Go to Birmingham-1963 is a great book for all ages. It teaches children about what happened during those times without going completely in depth. I really enjoyed this novel and read it when I was younger, and now being older reading it has had more of an impact on me. It shows how drastic things were, and was a great novel and I defiantly recommend it to anyone. great!"
1,Not what I thought I was getting,"I ordered this book to replace one my daughter borrowed from her teacher after I spilled coffee on it. I found it on Amazon and compared to the book I had, looked identical. The book I received from Amazon was much smaller. It had the same number of pages, but nowhere on that book or in the ad did it say it was a condensed version. I was a little embarrassed that I couldn't replace the book exactly as it was."
5,Affordable option,I purchased this item as an alternative to buying it in a bulk order because it was actually a better deal. The book arrived in no time and in good condition. I was very pleased!
4,A very interesting and meaningful book.,The book Watsons go to Birmingham-1963 is about the Watsons' family. HOw they depended and trusted eachother to live and go through all the hardships in their life. Kenny which is the main character in the book is cross eyed and has problems in his school with his friends. Since Kenny is very smart and doesnt fit with others everybody picked on him. His brother By was the only reason why his school days were a little better. By was the strongest and the meanest bully in the school. Everybody obeyed him. Outside he was acting mean and like he didnt care but at the end the readers will realize the real side of him. The story gets more interesting when they move to Birminham for two months. I think this book is a great book for grades 5 through 7.
5,Byron Gone Crazy !!!!!,This book is Awesome! I loved it. I got so into it on the first page. It is filled with exciting events. This book is thrilling and interesting. It teaches you the real reason of having a good family.
3,The Watsons Go to Birmingham,"This book wasn't one of my favorite books. It was interesting in some parts of the book. Like the whole church part, where Kenny went in the church and didn't think he saved Joey, that was one of my favorite parts. I also liked the part when Byron killed the Dove with a cookie and started throwing up and crying. I would probably recommend this book to other people... because yeah I liked it. So read this book if you want to know more about how it was in the 1963."
4,Feliza's Review,"The Watson's Go to Birmingham-1963 Was about five people. Momma, dad, Joetta, Kenny and Byron. Momma had a gap in her two front teeth. Dad is always working on the Brown Bomber. Joetta is always trying to keep Byron from getting in trouble with his parents. Kenny has a lazy eye and is always getting picked on. Byron was always getting in trouble.It took place in Flint Michigan.The part I liked was... one day Byron and Kenny went were scrapping the car windows. kenny went inside and Byron started kissing the mirror because he thought he looked good. His lips got froze to the mirror.Kenny came out and saw that his lips were stuck.Dad and momma tried several ways to get his lips off.The message i got from the story was your family is more important than you thinkso you shouldn't back talk them."
4,This was a wonderful experience!,"Reading this novel was a great experience and it gave me a new look on segregation in the mid 1900's. It traveled a different road by really developing the characters of an african-american family with only one racist act in the entire novel. The fact that it was a children's book gave it a great perspective from little Kenny's shoes. Most of the books and movies show how racist it was by presenting every racist thing that happened. But in ""The Watsons Go to Birmingham"" it shows a normal african-american family with only one racist act, the church bombing. It showed, more than anything I have ever seen or read, how a racist thing like the bombing can affect a normal family. Reading this book was a wonderful experience and it has given me a very new look on racism and segregation."
5,WEIRD WATSON'S,"There was a family of 5, Kenneth(kenny), Joetta(joey), Byron(by), Wilona(mom), Daniel(dad).Byron is really bad, he plays with matches and he's a big bully. His mom, Wilona and his dad, Daniel, says there going to send him to stay with his Grandma Sands. When he plays with matches, his mom said she's going to burn him if he plays with them again.Then there mom and dad tell them to start packing there going to Birmingham,Alabama to stay with Grandma Sands.But, they don't believe them, because they always say there going to send Byron to saty with her.Will the Watson's go to Birmingham to stay with Grandma Sands?Read the book to see what happens and see if they really go to Birmingham!!This was a good book!!"
4,The Watsons Go To Birmingham - 1963,"Well the very first thing is Byron got into trouble alot.The other thing is that the takes a trip to Birmingham to leave byron because of his behaver.The last thing is that there was a ""CHURCH BOMBING""! and 4 girls young girls died.Well there was two settings one in a snowy ice cold Flint,Michigan.The other thing is a hot sunny place in Birmingham,Alabama.The conflict of the story is that there was a CHURCH BOMBING! in Alabama.So Kenny feels that something is going to happen in Flint.But the resolution of the story is that Byron talks to kenny and tells him that people are just plan evil and don't worry about it."
4,The Watsons Go To Birmingham,"It thought the book was great, funny. It wasn't my type of book but i liked it though. What i liked about the book was when byron got a conk and che had to get his head shaved."
3,The Watsons Go to Birmingham- 1963,I thought the book waz great. the book to me was my type i wish i could read another book like that.What i like about the book was the chapter about when Byron gets in trouble about playing when matches and when he gets a conk.
4,Wool Pooh,I think this book was a very good book. It tied fiction with reality. In 1963 Birmingham was basically a war zone. It was very heartless and un christian like for that man to kill those little girls. There was just no reason. It was also very good the way that the author tied in the whole Watson family with the Bombing.
4,"The Watsons go to Birmingham, Book Review","Have you ever had you tongue stuck to a car mirror in the middle of December? Or has your mother ever purposely try to burn your finger? Well if you can relate to these issues, this is a book for you!When you grow up in a family called the ""Weird Watsons"" your life will be very queer. With a juvenile delinquent brother named Byron. A take along sister, Joanna. A machine-crazed father, and a fire-spooked mother, you can understand how this combination is a wacky and interesting time! We thought this book was incredibly interesting. Mixed up in the middle of the civil rights movement, this is a wacky ride that you need to take!"
2,The Waston go to Birmingham -1963,"The author of my book is Newbery Award Winner Chistopher Paul Curtis. The story was about a ten-year-old boy name Kenny. He has one brother who is a juvenile delinquent. The family was very weird to many people. The sister was kind of quiet but Bryon, the brother, was out of control. I would recommend the book for age 12 and up. Because young children would not understand. The theory of this book.It possibly could be fun for them. It's very uninteresting for me."
2,Uninteresting,"I found this book boring, and at the age of fourteen, juvenile. There were some humorous parts about Kenny and his family, but basically I wouldn't read it again nor would I recommend it to anyone over the age of ten or eleven. Bethany Richeson-8th grade"
5,Kandi's wierd watsons,"hi my name is Kandi, I like this book I would give this book to anyone that would like to learn about old stuff this is the book for u.The book is real funny when u get in to it like the first to chapters in it That is when it gets funny. I like how the author put like he put it like he was there. Out of the hole story my favorite person was Joey she is very sensitive in the story.I am a 7th geader at Leland middle school."
4,Aysha.I,"At the begining the Watsons are not very series, they joke around alot and the mood of the story is happy. Byron, the oldest kid in the family is a juvenile deliquent and he wants to be cool. Kenny the middle aged child is well behaved and he respects the rules. Byron is always getting in trouble so his parents decide to take him to Birmingham to to stay with Gradnma Sands so she can straightren him up. This story takes place during 1963 so there is alot of discrimination going on. When there Byron starts to behave and Kenny starts to act up. When Joey goes to Church a bomb blows up there and four young girls are killed. The Family decides to go back to Flint, Michigan because they want to be a more close family. I enjoyed reading this book because it helped me understand how hard it was for Black famlies during this time."
3,The conk,I think the book was good. I liked it alot it was pretty funny. I would say that other teenagers should read it becaouse it can teach them about situations people were going threw back then. This was actually the first book that I was intrastud in and wanted to read it.
4,The Watsons Go to Birmingham 1963,"In the Watson family there are five people.Momma,Dad,Byron,Kenny,Joetta.Byron is 13 years old and he gets in a lot of trouble.After a couple months of Byron lighting mathes and throwing them in the toliet.The Watsons go to Birmingham.Momma planned the whole trip.During the trip Byron changed a lot.While they were in Birmingham Kenny thought he was going to die."
3,What happens next?!?!?!,"this book was ok. I just don't like the end, it leaves you hanging!!! other than that, this book is good."
3,"Good Book, Overall","I liked Kenny's character. It was well developed and solid. He was thoughtful and insightful and always brought needed humor to a situation. He was a great addition to counteract Byron's evil, sinister ways with a kind, innocent child. Some characters, however, were not so developed and I, the reader would have liked to know more about them! Grandma seemed like such an interesting, complicated person, whom I would have loved to ""get to know""."
3,A hidden but sparkling Swedish gem. Uncover it.,"Eversince Soundtrack Of Our Lives released 'Behind The Music', I've been searching for another Swedish export with the same type of power, diversity, and production slickness...I may have found it with Citizen Bird's self-titled album. Earlier in the decade, this brief spurt of Swedish bands ranged from spacey ambience and garage-rock to bland indie sounds, but nothing that matched the retro-psychadelia meets 70's rock groove of 'Behind The Music'. Yet if you backtrack a few years earlier, you will find it with Citizen Bird's (formerly Silverbullit) sophomore effort. Just think a combination of the Soundtrack Of Our Lives' Stones meets Zeppelin guitar-swagger, Spacemen 3 or early Spiritualized, along with flashes of The MC5. Who knows, Citizen Bird could even be considered the Scandanavian cousin of the Black Rebel Motorcycle Club or The Warlocks. Regardless a really nice find, and I tip my hat towards Epitonic for leading me in the right direction."
3,Great but the worst recording i hear,"fisrt of all excuse me for my bad englih, i m french ;o)A concert recording can't be perfect, this is the worst i hear. All the people are ill and the record man was probably far as 50m of the piano behind a door.So, Why three stars ?because i love this music and nobody play it as Richter this day.Great music, Great moment..."
4,Great camcorder,"Great camcorder with reasonable price, the only con is that at night it doesn't have extra light( it has the inlet for a light but not included in the box) so the outcome is not very clear."
5,Don't let the magic die,"Tajar Tales is the kind of book that only gets better the more it is read. The charming drawings and hysterical situations that Tajar manages to create for himself appeal to children, but also to adults with a little bit of child still within their souls. Anyone who has been a summer camp counselor or who ever plans to should definitely think about getting this book. Tajar can not only be read aloud, but with a few props and a few willing ""hams"" Tajar can be brought to life. One of the best things about this book is that it can be read in one sitting, or each of the stories can be saved and savored one at a time. This book is a classic for a reason, and anyone who has experienced Tajar first hand will concur...there is still magic in this world; we just need to remember where to look."
3,Good 'Ol Jamiroquai,"If you're a big fan of them like I am you'll enjoy this latest effort, you will however notice that song for song it may not compare to the older albums in content. Gone are the days of the global peace and equality messages, but the music stays true to who they are essentially. Someone else mentioned the split with Stuart Zender has had an impact and I agree, the Synchronized vibe is gone, but the album is still good on the whole. I HAD to have it when it came out, but the truth is, I've taken it out of rotation already..."
1,GARBAGE,"This album is garbage! A lot of people are saying that it reminds them of Traveling Without Moving which I don't understand because THAT my friends is a GREAT album but not this one. Jamiroquai's first three albums are masterpieces in my opinion. The horn arrangements in Emergency On Planet Earth and Traveling are tight and funky. This album lacks the funk and arrangements that made me such a big Jamiroquai fan.I keep buying his albums hoping that they will get better but they are only getting worse. If you're a fan like me and have to have it, I say buy it used. I was so excited to buy this album that I bought the import before it came out in the states. What a disappointment."
2,VERY DISAPPOINTED,"I WAS EAGER ABOUT HEARING NEW MUSIC FROM ONE OF MY FAVORITE BANDS, JAMIROQUAI. AND AFTER SEEING SO MANY REVIEWS THAT HAD 4 TO 5 STARS I DECIDED TO BUY IT, WHAT A MISTAKE. THIS CD ONLY HAS 2 SOLID HITS THE REST IS GARBAGE. I WAS EXPECTING TO HEAR THE STYLE I WAS USE TO IN HIS OTHER HITS LIKE TRAVELLING AND RETURN OF THE SPACE COWBOY. THIS CD IS ALL OVER THE PLACE. SOME SONGS SOUND COUNTRY, OTHERS ARE ... I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO CALL IT. READERS, PLEASE READ ALL THE REVIEWS BEFORE BUYING, I WISHED I HAD."
4,Nice Compilation CD for a great price,This CD had alot of the hits you'd expect from Nat King Cole.Great for a person wanting an intro to his music. An added bonus is that the CD has a long track list for a single CD.
4,Good book for novice primitive pottery makers,"I never previously attempted any pottery creations and had no idea where to start. This book pointed me in the right direction and gave me confidence that even a beginner might make pottery pieces. Following directions I dug clay from my property, tempered it, made the pottery and pit-fired it. It actually turned our reasonably well for a first attempt. An easy to read and follow beginners guide. Well worth the price!"
5,Best Harry Potter Movie,"This is by far the best Harry Potter Movie. It's the single movie that made me decide to actually read the books. I'm glad I did, it ended up being well worth the time."
5,Great,"The DVD came in fast and was a good, brand new in the plastic video. The movie was at a great price which I enjoyed"
2,Sad Installation To the Saga,"I will keep this brief. I tolerate this movie because it is part of the Saga but in my opinion the director fouled up horribly. The movie is relate to the book but it skips and omits in an unbelievable fashion. The entire time thing just does not make sense. The complete overhaul of the castle is horrifying. The alteration of the movie so as to remove Quiditch entirely from the plot line is abhorrent. Please don't get me wrong - I enjoy the movie but as I said - only because its apart of the series. But in my opinion the director did not really care much about the storyline or the book. He had an idea - he had never read the book - he altered, cut, mutilated and destroyed. So. Thats all I have to say. Just dissapointed that this movie could have been so much more... and it wasn't."
4,A good intro to Harry Potter stories,"An engaging film, the third harry potter movie does the best job of introducing new fans to the magical world of harry potter. It has to, for time, cut out some of the better parts of the story (such as the fact that harry's father and his friends were animagi and ""moony, wormtail, padfoot and prongs"" and the reason for snape's hatred of james and harry potter). despite these omissions, the film does a better job of showing the humanity of harry and of enhancing the darker nature of this film. As someone who did not originally read the books, this film actually interested me enough to find and read all of the harry potter books and beome a fan myself."
1,I Wonder What Would Happen If I Watched The Whole Thing...,"A few days ago i managed to catch 15 minutes of this movie and it was enough for me! For one thing, the plot has barely anything in common with the book. Isn't Professor Lupin supposed to be shabby and long-haired? Well, actually he looked like a thin Mr. Dursley and he even wore muggle clothes. Malfoy is portrayed as a big sissy, because when Hermione punched him, he started crying. Plus, they totally didn't explain the werewolf situition at all. All-in-all, the people who made this movie should really read the book a few times first."
3,"Nice try, but could have been better","I will not give this film 5 stars just because it's a Harry Potter movie. This film was riddled with mistakes. Flat out, blatant, purposfully-done mistakes all in the name of saving time for more showings per day.This film never explains who wrote the Marauders Map.This film never let's Harry know his father's Animagus matched his own Patronus.This film never let you see Hermione acquire her cat, thus, leaving out the Pet Shop scene, the clue of Scabbers having only 9 toes... etcAt the end, Harry alone knocks Snape out with Expelliarmus. In the book, it is the ""three"".So much more. You get the idea."
1,Totally disappointed,"This movie was awful! I don't really know how these other people liked it. If I hadn't read the book, I would have had NO idea what was going on with certain scenes in the movie. Other things were added that had no business being in the movie. Maybe it was the director's attempt at humor with some of these things, but failed miserably. Warner Bros. would do well NOT to hire this director for the remainder movies. With the first two movies, I felt like I was in a magical place, with this one...it was just a bunch of kids with magic tricks. Save your time and money on this one...read the book. It's WAY better."
3,HARRY POTTER,haryy potter 3 the book is the best in the harry potter series. but the film is cut short and lots of the interesting parts are missing. but the film is ok by their acting and all the special effects. its worth the price you know.
3,Better if you don't know the book,"I watched this movie when it came out in the theater, even though I have been disappointed in the previous two movies. The departures from the original story plots are just too great for me to enjoy them completely, and this third installment has shown more changes in the storyline than the others. So, why do I go? The only reason these movies are worth watching is for the excellent characterizations of Harry, Hermione, and Ron. These three actors have the parts down pat, and I applaud their efforts. Richard Harris was a wonderful Dumbledore, and it would have been hard to replace him in any case, but their choice of actors was wrong, at least to me. The image I have of Dumbledore does not fit this new actor.Bottom line: See the movie for the three main characters and try to ignore the gaping absence of the original story."
4,I was disappointed,"As a grandmother, and Harry Potter fan, I didn't think this movie met the high standard set by the first two. While the cast is, as ever, excellent, and Gary Oldman was great as always, the alterations made to the book diminished the tale, I thought. And was I the only one to notice the altered geography around the castle? The movie was ok, but would have been better had they filmed the book as it is. Leaving out the second Quiddich match was, I think, a mistake. On the other hand, Buckbeak was wonderful, the werewolf effects were good, and Gary Oldman gibbering to Lupin ""Let's kill him now!"" was priceless. Emma Thompson was hilarious, too. But nobody can replace the late Richard Harris as Dumbledore, I'm sad to say.Overall, not bad, but not as good as I had hoped. But still, fun for all Harry Potter fans, of all ages, so by all means, see it if you haven't already."
3,Sadness,"After the first two movies came out, I was totally excited for number 3. Not so good. Doesnt even compair to Chris Columbus's work. They dont even have school uniforms. That isnt even close to like the book. Things were cut out and not explained. Get this, the first to movies were longer and the 3rd book has about 200 more pages. Big disappointment for the harry potter fiends like myself. No oliver wood? Griffindor is suppost to win the cup!!! Hello!! That was like a huge thing in the 3rd book. Its like leaving out the polly jucie potion in the Chamber of Secrets, ummm no, i dont think so. Fred and George are hardly even in the movie! Its not even that funny. Come on Warner Brothers step its up. Dont even think about ruining book 4 or Ill come after you in the night."
1,Not so Ultimate,Buyer beware The Ultimate edtion of movies 3 and 4 are the movie you saw at the movies and bought on dvd or blu-ray years ago not extended editions of the movie. The Ultimate edtions of the first two movies had extended verisons of both movies. The only place you will see the unused scences from movies 3 and 4 is on disc 2 of each set. If you already have these movies on dvd or blu-ray don't waste your money on the Ultimate sets unless you really want a couple of trading cards and a couple a new featurettes. A waste of money.
4,Much darker and much better than the 1st two,"A lot of people, my mother and brother included, did not like this movie as much as the first two because it deviates from the books a bit. But let's be realistic, the director is never going to be able to cram all of the book into a movie.It's good, but the book is still better..."
3,"FANTASTIC CGG, TIRED STORY LINE SEEN IT BEFORE/TOO LONG!","RENT BEFORE YOU BUY, UNLESS YOU ARE A POTTER AFICIANADO."
3,Okay,I got the ultimate edition mostly for the extras I had this in standard DVD they really missed the mark in my opinion getting a man who barely spoke English from what I heard and did mostly Spanish language movies.
1,Huge disappointment,"As a huge Harry Potter fan, I cannot see how anyone could have enjoyed the Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban movie. This book is the best one in the entire series and I never thought it could be ruined. Before the release of the movie I thought to myself, how can it be bad since the book is so good? Well, the movie positvely butchered the book. The cast was fine, the acting was good, computer animation was great, but c'mon! Was the movie even based on the book because I couldn't tell! The movie was so unlike the book in countless ways! They added a lot of unnecessary things, yet left out some very important information. I don't know how they expect to make more movies because so much was left out of this one. People who only see the movies will be totally confused. So, if you are a big fan of the Harry Potter books, I do not recommend seeing this movie, much less buying it."
1,you lost me!,"I was prepared to purchase this (as well as year 4) but once I read that neither set includes extended versions of the films, I decided to save my money. There are plenty of other things more deserving of my hard earned money. If the ""powers that be"" want my money, they should re-release this with an extended cut of the film just like they did with years 1 & 2."
5,Another Great Movie,"The seller was amazing! The Combo Blu-Ray, DVD, Digital is perfect for families with a variety of ways to watch movies. The digital copy code is going to expire really soon (spring of 2012). Purchase it right away to take advantage of the three videos before it becomes a two video combo pack."
3,I liked the first two movies better,"I was disappointed in this third Harry Potter movie. What bothered me most is that the kids were always in ""muggle"" clothes. I like them better in their school robes and cloaks. If I wanted to see kids in muggle clothes I can go to any mall on Saturday afternoon and there are thousands running around in them. Unfortunately I did see a review and knew that the director was planning on them wearing their muggle clothes more and it may have drawn my attention to it more than it would have had I not heard about it before hand. So, if this review did the same to someone else, I apologize. I do plan on buying the movie anyway. Maybe the next time I will be able to get past the clothes and just enjoy the movie. Anyway, the books will always be so much better than the movies."
4,"""The movie is not as good as the book.""","Of *course* it isn't as good as the book. Movie adaptations almost never are. Things have to be changed in order to work, and some things are inevitably lost in the transition.That said, it's the best one yet. The first two movies were mediocre partly because they tried to follow the books too closely and brought nothing to the story- why would you watch a second-rate edited version of events when you can read the brilliant original?Azkaban was darker, funnier, and more believable. The changes made to the storyline didn't feel forced or unnatural. What won me over were the details; seeing the characters out of uniform or goofing off with magic animal crackers...they're kids at a magic school, but they're still kids. The acting was excellent all-round.I can't see Phoenix making the jump to the big screen successfully: they'd have to cut it down a lot or make two films. But if they do make another, hopefully Alfonso Cuarón remains the director."
1,What a horrible movie!!!!!!!!!,"I don't know who directed this movie, but they did a horrible job of the making it. I don't understand why they only tap on the most important scenes, and make them seem so unimportant. I am sooooo glad they put in a new director for The Goblet of Fire. I think this series might have gone out of style. It was in very poor taste."
5,The BEST Film Ever!!!!,"This truly is the best movie I have ever seen! Alfonso Cuaron was the perfect director for this movie. Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, and Rupert Grint performed their parts better with dramatically improved acting. John Williams' musical score is beautiful and captures the fear, action, and emotion. The visual effects are incredible and worthy of an academy award. I would give the story an A+++! I highly recommend The Prisoner of Azkaban for anyone, fan or not."
3,Its OKAY...,"Well, it wasnt to bad except for a few things. The new Dumbledor is to energetic and nothing LIKE the original. The director keeps using that damn fade circle between scenes. Not enough is explained. Dont waste your money. Oh, not to mention that it doesnt cope in the cool boxes like the first 2 movies. Other than that, the action is cool, and its not to bad."
3,Disappointing Third Ultimate Edition,"Like many others have already posted, I was most disappointed in the lack of an extended edition of this movie. The fact that you get so much less value for the same price as the first two Ultimate Editions is simply inexcusable. WB's claims that the producers felt the theatrical version wasn't in need of re-editing is obviously nothing but an excuse. While I heartily recomend the first two Ultimate Editions, I would advise skipping over #3 and #4 and buy the less expensive Blu-ray versions (which gives you the same movie experience for 1/3 the price), unless you are a compulsive collector. Hopefully #5-7 will include proper extended editions or this will be my last purchase of the Ultimate Edition series."
2,very different from the first two movies,I have read all the books and have seen the first two movies. This newest movie did not have the same feel as the first two Harry Potter movies. I kept finding myself looking around to see if I was in the right theater. The movie was too dark and confusing. It did not seem to match the book. I was surprised the author had allowed this director to produce the 3rd movie in this way. I wanted to see the whole movie because it was a Harry Potter movie but at the same time the urge to leave the theater early was pretty strong. We were all a bit disappointed by this movie. I am not sure this movie is worth buying maybe you could just reread the 3rd book again.
1,no magic left,"i think that film is just bad. There is no magic left from movie one and two. It is cutted ways too fast, there is no space for any emotions or acting.There are many important things left out from the book, but film-time is wasted with such a stupid scene with making animal noises and steaming out of the ears because of eating candies. And I didn't know that Titanic needs a tribute from Harry Potter!And why were all the sets changed? Is this big clock in the book? And since when is Hogwarts in the mountains?And the end is just terrible!The movie is boring and lets you completely cold.I wished Peter Jackson would take GoF. Perhaps then we could looking forward to a good movie. But else..."
4,"Great, but not as good as the first two.","This is a great movie, but the first two were better. The special effects were wonderful, alot better than that of the first two. The best scene would have to be the quidditch scene. It's fairly short, but it was really awesome. The movie it self was short, and parts of it, exspecialy the beganning, where rushed. Like I said it was good, but the 1st & 2nd were better."
4,Harry Potter Movie Purchase Review,Purchased this item for gift for grandchildren. Received order within a short time. Very fast service.
4,Another Harry Success,"Another Harry Success. Fine story twists...great new characters & actors...special effects, excellent as usual. Overall..thoroughly engrossing...a delight watching Harry, Ron and Hermione growing up."
3,Alfonso Curon destroyed the movie...,"I've hoped that the new director Alfonso Curon could have made the third part of Harry Potter books better than the first, but, I was wrong... That son of a... wasn't going to the book at all!!! The movie could have been better when Columbus was the director of the third part (because he is doing everything by the book). And i hope that ""The Goblet of Fire"" is going to be a sucess (but with Alfonso no way!!! New director immidaetly!!!)"
4,Something's missing...,"Even though they left out some crucial information that's in the book, it is still by far the best film of the year so far. But I think it could have been better if they had the adult actors in it for more scenes. Alan Rickman (Snape), Robbie Coltrane (Hagrid), Maggie Smith (McGonagall), Julie Walters (Mrs. Weasley), and Mark Williams (Mr. Weasley) weren't in it for very long. Also, the title character, Sirius Black (Gary Oldman), wasn't really in it for that much time at all either! Pettigrew (Timothy Spall) wasn't either. This movie is shorter than the other two movies. I think it could've been longer if they shortened the scene when Harry is riding on Buckbeak and added more Aunt Marge and more to the Shrieking Shack scene. But otherwise, a masterpiece."
3,not the best,I didn't enjoy this movie as much of the previous two.I follow the books more than the movies and in the end of the fourth book things start to dramatically change. I guess I don't like it as much because there was so much change. It seemed like it had a taste of lord of the rings in it. I have nothing against lord of the rings but its just not the same. I liked it but it didn't seem to fit in with the rest of the series. I probably set my expectation too high since the third book is my favorite. I think you would enjjjoy the movie ecspesially if you don't expect it to be like the other movies.
2,Too Much Missing,"In comparison with the first two Harry Potter movies, this film does not do the books justice. The characters are under-developed, large chunks of the plot are missing or inaccurate, the location of filming was moved - so this is NOT the ""original"" Hogwarts, and the feel of the movie is too dark to be appropriate. The acting is a bit better in this film in comparison to the first two, but there are several over-the-top, ""cheesy"" moments that ruin the general feel.This movie could have, and perhaps should have, been at least an hour longer than it is to ensure that the audience is not left with a ""huh?"" feeling. As a Harry Potter fan I would probably buy this movie just because I want a whole set - but I wouldn't buy it until it's very inexpensive - or until someone else is willing to buy it as a gift.In either case, it will sit on the shelf and definitely won't be watched nearly as often as the first two films."
3,"OK, but I expectd more","The movie is too fast-paced and a lot of times the action just jumped from one event to another without much connection. The quidditch cup final match was missing. Dementors look a bit like halloween decoration people put on the trees, not scary at all. Very pale after Lord of the rings. On the positive side, the kids are fantastic, as are Black and Lupin. I like Lupin most of all."
1,Why is this so expensive?,"This is not truly a ""limited edition"" and can be found just about anywhere online for less. It would be a good price if it was the limited edition, however."
1,No extended cut just expanded price,"If you enjoyed the Ultimate Edtions for one and two do not buy this edtion it isn't worth the added cost. There are five hours of documentry, which I may watch at some later time but not one of those hours the nice case or the ""trading cards?"" or whatever the hell they are, are worth the added cost. If you all ready have an existing blu-ray copy of this flim don't give WB any more of your money you'll not get what you pay for.It makes me angry to see WB resorting the same unreputable tactics so enjoyed by Gorge Lucas. This coupled with the unwieldy formt of the WB digital libry they force you to use for thier digital copies has really turned me from buying any more of their products."
3,disappointing,"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban was one of my favorite books out of the 5 so far, i was pretty dissapointed with this movie though i have to say. They changed Hogwarts completely and the first two movies were much better. If I hadn't read the book i probably wouldn't have even understood exactly what was going on. Now it's not the worst movie i've ever scene but still i don't think a book as good as harry potter deserves a movie like that and i hope the 4th one is better"
5,Excellent,"I really loved this movie. The story was great and it was really enjoyable. I saw it in the IMAX and it was just amazing, but a few scenes must have been cut out because it was shorter then the regular version and the part where they find Sirius and Peter Pettigrew was really cunfusing and didn't make sense (one second they all wanted to kill each other, and the next Harry wanted to go live with Sirius?). Otherwise, I'm just waiting for the DVD."
5,Harry Potter on the big screen at his best!,"Yes, it's not the book...what did you expect?This movie portrays the book better than anything could. It brings major entertainment with it, whether you've read the book or not. PoA is my favorite HP movie yet. I liked the first two, they told the story...the end. The third movie tells the story and you feel emotion! I was so missing emotion in the first two. PoA makes you feel so much for Harry...This movie is really great! The actors have matured so much too! The best yet!"
2,What was he thinking,"After watching this movie I was told that I was a purist. This is because I almost hated this movie. I do grant that the movie had gorgeous cinematography in many scenes but that it lacked in the rest. There are even some plot holes in there. The screenplay and/or director made the movie almost incompatable with the rest of the series if you have not read the books. There were some major scenes and facts needed to push the other stories along that didn't make it into the movie and scenes that did make that weren't nearly as important. Overall, I find that it is my love for the stories that allows me to give such a high rating to this movie because I was gravely dissapointed in it."
5,"At last, a Potter movie that moves!","The first HP movie was strong, and had to introduce Rowling's world, the characters, and essential tensions. The second movie flagged, and was limp and burdened by details. This movie sets a tone that the rest will need -- fast-paced, necessary ellisions, a movie that feels like a movie, not a book on screen. The pacing is excellent, the effects great, and you're whisked along from beginning to end. Much better acting, and Lupin is great. A pleasant surprise!"
2,A DISGRACE to the book!,"This reviw is written by a 13 year old female Harry Potter fan.I went to see the movie, and came out extremly dissapionted.Alfonso Curon seriously messed the movie up.I have read Prisoner of Askaban at least 4 times and 75 percent of the book was simply left out completely. There were GIANT plot holes, and I do not understand how someone who had not read the book would understand the plot. The first two movies were the best ever. They were funny,intertaining,and gave good justice to the book.Sadly, this movie did not. I could rant FOREVER about all the things I did not like, but I will not. Do not juge the book buy this movie. Go read the book,and you won't be dissapointed!"
3,Warner Brothers: Have You Lost Your Minds?!!,"My young children even noticed that something was not right! Hagrids house is not down the hill from the school. You need to get the old sets and filming areas back. My youngest stated that you made Professor Dumbledore look like one of the ""bag people living under the bridge in the city"". In movie 1 & 2 Professor Dumbledore was clean, dignified, a gentleman, dressed like royalty and was quiet spoken. In movie three he was loud, had black fingernails and grubby clothes, I didn't even know it was Dumbledore at first. If I had been casting I would have gotten Christopher Lloyd, he could have steped right into the part and looked like the original and would have given the part the class it required. You need to get Chris Columbus back or find someone who will "" stick to the book and previoue movies"" You cannot fool children, children are not dumb, Harry Potter is their hero. They can tell you the whole first 2 movies in their sleep."
5,Can be better,"This movie is great, darker and capture the essence of the book but at the same time, key information are missing leaving a non HP fan a bit loss. But it is a well done movie, the special effects are amazing. Definitely should get but NOT a substitution for the book!"
3,"Not HORRIBLE, but not too good at that","The first 2 were awesome, but this one just didn't adapt to the books as well as I'd hoped it would....maybe my expectations were just too high from the book. Not bad, but a bit disappointing."
2,Bring Back Chris Columbus,"What a disapointment. I already read the books and saw the first two movies multiple times. The third was horrific. It did not even closley resemble anything in the first two (colors, buildings, even the fat lady changed. WHY?). Additionally they mixed up the sequence of the book and honestly had you not read the book, you would have been terribly confused because a lot of detail was lost. Now no one can say that there was no time because the scene with Harry on the Hippograph was what...2 minutes...and he didn't even like his ride on it to begin with. The last scene with Harry flying in the air on his broom was out of sequence with the book and really innapropriate for Harry's character. Flying off - showing off in front of anyone when not in a game is just not in his character. They focused too much on fluff and visual effects and not nearly enough on dialogue - please stick to the book in the fourth one."
4,Wish it was better...,"Well, it was pretty good. The dementors looked good in this movie and I thought Gary Oldman was perfect for the role of Sirius Black. It worth a watch."
1,The Dementors Look Like Nazgul,"I love the books, they're timeless classics, but with the first two films Chris Colombus insulted his own talent with such films as Home Alone and Mrs. Doubtfire. I guess he has the comedy spark, but the action spark ( retching ). And the dementors are a complete ripoff of Peter Jackson's wonderful Nazgul design. I was excited when Film One came out. What a stinker. I went to see Film Two only because some friends wanted to see it. A little better than Film One, but I think they used the effects for Aragog that Jackson for Shelob. And I almost wrote Aragorn, Aragorn and Aragog sound so much alike. All in all on a scale of one to ten I give this a 0."
2,Disappointing,"I've read all the Harry Potter books and saw the first two movies. I was really looking forward to this movie. The acting was fine (the ""kids"" are getting better) and the animation and special effects were great. However, if you hadn't read the book, you'd be totally lost. The plot kept jumping around with no explanation of how they got from one place to another. I got the impression that Cuarón was trying to fit everything in but didn't have enough time so he just jumped from one scene to the next with no tie-in. My husband has not read the books. Although he watched both previous movies and was looking forward to this one, he walked out within the first half hour because he found it so confusing and, thus, unenjoyable. This movie was a real disappointment."
1,Very disappointing,"As a huge Harry Potter fan, and having really enjoyed the first two movies, I was very eager to see 'The Prisoner of Azkaban', and now I wish I had rented it and saved my money. There is almost no character development, and Hogwarts now looks as if it is a ruin. But perhaps worst of all it is a poorly constructed movie. My husband, who has not read the books, but thoroughly enjoyed the first two movies, was completely lost in this one. Scenes change quickly, frequently with no explanation, and while this is not a serious problem if you have read the book, for others it makes for a choppy, disjointed mess. Let's hope that if they make the fourth movie, they'll change directors."
3,What happened to the packaging?,"I have yet to explore the DVD's bells and whistles, but I am disappointed before I even open the case. What happened to the unique cases used for the first two films? There is nothing wrong with the standard DVD case other than the fact that you have never used it for this series before.I wish Warner Bros. would stick to what they started. Of course, this probably drives sales of those high priced box sets."
4,Good,I believe that Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is a pretty good movie. It's not a great Harry Potter Movie but in General it is a great movie overall.1. The Acting is pretty well done2.It has beautiful camera shots3.It is well directed despite not following the book.4.It is growing up with the generation who first read the book.It is much more dark and I think that that was a good idea on the part of the director because when the series started the kids that were reading were about 8 and on. When the movie came out in 2001 the kids were older. Now at about 16 and up we expect more maturity from the movies.
3,Disappointing Movie,"""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" is not as good a storyline as the first two movies. The location shots in Scotland are great, but the topography established in the first two movies is completely twisted around in this movie.Haggrid's hut is no longer a simple walk outside of Hogwart's, but a long downhill hike. The Whumping Willow is no longer on Hogwart's grounds but outside! When did this come about? I could go on and on but the gist of it is that the director of the first two movies should have been at the helm of this third movie.Don't get me wrong the special effects are good, but there are no deleted or extended scenes in this two-disc set, there are interviews with cast and crew with a animitronic shrucken head doing lame jokes as co-host, and there is little of the how-the-movie-was-made info available. All around a real disappointment."
2,"It was Ok, but not great","I thought this movie was going to be great; The reviews and critics all agreed it was the best movie. And the new director was supposed to be one of the best.I was very disapointed.First of all, let me explain that I love the whole series and the last two movies. However, this movie was not very good. It hardly followed the story line, and it hardly explained anything. Oh, the acting was great, but the director and writer slipped in some unnecessary things, such as a budding romance between Harry and Hermione. (...)Another thing I found irritating was the complete change of the Hogwarts grounds. Not only had the castle changed its shape, but the forest and Hagrids hut had both relocated themselves.Other than those *few minor errors* it was great. I love Daniel Radcliffe and his acting."
4,"An well written book, understandable for even an educated non-specialist","I bought this for my son, who is doing a PhD in this field at McGill. But I also read it and found it to be pretty understandable (my degree is in physics, but not at this level or in this specialization). I believe that my son has found it to be a useful resource as well."
1,Not worth the money...even in a digital format...,This does little to shed light on the original form the Heian Kata are taken from...Add to this the photos are of poor quality and the Sensei is executing poor technique and stance.I also looked it up on You Tube and it confirmed his poorly executed form...Save your money and find someone that knows the form.Even if it costs you some bucks.
4,Great album but I found The Number of the Beast better.,"As with all other Iron Maiden albums, except for the newest cd out liek 2000 or something (what a discrace to the name), its great. I personally like Number of the Beast and also Somewhere in Time more becuase it sounds more like what they started at. And as for that dumbass Avril Fan... I think that you really shouldnt judge what you don't know anything about. If youre into metal then you got a right to give your opinion but if you have no clue and don't appreciate the art here than keep your thoughts to yourself. You'll never find me rating Avril or any other pop for that matter becuase thats just not my deal. and the same goes out to anyone who goes and rates Marilyn Manson and leaves a one line responce stating ""Marilyn Manson Ewe"". Well i think that the album is definitly worth the money. Enjoy."
4,Blood is Freedom's Stain,"IMO Iron Maiden had a period of 4 consecutive albums from 1982-1986 where they were in their prime: Number of the Beast, Piece of Mind, Powerslave, Somewhere in Time. I'd recommend you start with these and if u like 'em maybe get some more.The only bona-fide hit single type song is ""2 Minutes to Midnight"". The only clunker is ""The Duellists"" - a decent song ruined by an extra-cheesy chorus. The rest is pretty good too.The videos are pretty funny actually, ahhh.. 80s metal... :-)"
1,Terrible band...,"Well I dont know what any one sees in iron maiden personaly ? I never got into their music...I dont know.The lead singers vocals or the rest of the band! I have listing to every single song made by iron maiden to see if i would atleast like one but nope... Just can't get into them!!Well anyways,The production on this album is weak and the lirycs are mediocre plus the guitars are plain damn boring with the un original solos which needs some work... I might add! I know alot of bands that would make iron maiden look untalented one of them is king diamond...Now, those guys are an awsome band with talent and originality and amazing solos with intense lirycs and king diamond never gets boring unlike my buddys over here known as iron maiden! I swear i got so bored while listining to this album that i fellasleep haha! If you want an excellent band pick king diamond and skipt iron maiden! Down with the irons!!"
5,My Introduction to the greatest metal band of all-time.,"No one told me to get into Maiden,I got into them myself.It started with this album.I have only bought one of their albums but yet I have all of them(how is that possible),well I have happened to have done that.I stayed home from school one decemeber morning in 2005 and decided to download a few Maiden songs(Aces High,The Trooper,Two Minutes To Midnight,Powerslave(title track to this album),and the rest is well,.....history.I downloaded every song from this album and burned it into a blank cd and I was blown away by it.Of course I came back for more and downloaded every song from The Number Of The Beast and Piece Of Mind(thank god for downloading).I later downloaded every song from the debut,I thought, well this a little different but it was still rocking.I also got Killers downloaded but it took me a while to actually like that one.Then came the more progressive Somewhere In Time and Seventh Son(My favorite).Up The Irons!!!!"
3,"Great album, needs to be re-remastered","Iron Maiden will forever f***ing rule the planet. With POWERSLAVE being their 3rd best album, and a 2nd powerslave tour planned in 2008, Maiden have a whole lot ahead of them. They have 14 great albums out, and I have 4 of them so far: Powerslave, A Matter Of Life And Death, Dance of Death, and Brave New World.However, I'd have to say the opposite about this newly-released version of POWERSLAVE. The tracks are seperated, the audio is a bit off unlike the CD version released before this, and there is an even bigger problem: After Back In The Village, thing with the drums and the howling is supposed to be at the beginning of Powerslave. And not only that, I noticed some of the tracks are mixed.Other than that, it's a great album."
4,Great Start for anyone who wants to get in to serious metal,"Iron maiden is a great band with highly acessibly songs that any open minded person could enjoy, and if yur looking in to iron maiden i would definatly recomend starting with this album for an introduction into metal & and the Band it self, aces flying high, 2 minutes to midnight, and Flash of the blade are all here, if you want to dig deeper definatly check out the number of the beast."
4,Powerslave ~ Iron Maiden,"A great album, but a little to much of the same. Don't get me wrong, this album is great. But almost all the songs are fast. So when I listened to this album I thought it was very good, but I could not listen to this album as long as other Iron Maiden albums. The last two songs are totally different from the first six. Those two are my favorites together with Aces High and 2 Minites To Midnight. The songs between these songs aren't as great as those four and they are lookalikes. This is still a very good album and the most people don't think the same about this album as I do. I just wanted to give my opinion, your opinion about this album could be different, everybody has a different taste of music. That is good ofcours, because it would be boring if we all thought the same about these things.About the album again: It is very good, if you like hardrock or metal then this is something for you. I hope that my review helped you with your choice."
4,Some killer cuts on this cd,"Two minutes to midnight to me is one of the great heavy metal songs of all time, great riff, great lyrics. Aces high another great song. Powerslave another great song about how eygptian kings were viewed as god like. Back in the village another great rocker with great lyrics. The ancient mariner a little long based on coleridge's poem."
3,Cute introduction to hula for kids :),"I bought this to use for a library program for kids. It is an instructional dvd and shows step by step moves to the hula. There are two main movements taught in the beginning. The dances are a little complex when adding the arm movements but the dancing is beautiful and fun. Little girls especially would love to move back and forth to the music, telling the stories with their arms. It is a little awkward when she says to move to the right and we are watching her move to our left (I found that impossible). I just moved along with her and ignored the right/left instructions. There are some parts you'll want to play back over and over- like the 1st walkthrough of hand motions, since it's only shown once before performing it. And there are some parts where no instruction is happening that you will want to fast forward through. Overall it's fun and very colorful and cheerful."
3,AC/DC Nothing new or Different......,"...it merely rocks like all of their albums do. Folks, don't go looking for deep lyrical messages or complicated musical notes. This album is just great rock chords and men singing like they were still in puberty. In other words, it's AC/DC. If you like them buy it, if not, skip it."
1,It Hurts Me To Say This But...,"This album sucks bad. I love AC/DC but this is lame. The songs are dull, uninspired and VERY forgettable. Satellite Blues and Safe In NYC are ok, but the rest of them are just plain bad. I think the biggest problem is more than likely that Brian Johnson doesn't take any part in the songwriting and it shows. Angus and Malcom are good songwriters, but the best post-Bon Scott era AC/DC songs have always been written by Angus, Malcom AND Brian."
3,A good album,"I consider Stiff Upper Lip to be a good AC/DC album. It's not in the Back In Black or Highway To Hell league but it has some fine moments. The best track is Stiff Upper Lip as well as Safe In New York City, Satellite Blues and a great song called Give It Up. It falls away after that with some of the other songs, but all in all a good addition to the collection."
3,LIKE NOT COUNTRY!,"But it is funky-""Come And Get It."" And it is Rock and Roll-""Hold Me Back."" But mostly it's AC-DC. at their best-""Give It Up,"" and the title cut. I'd love some Bag Pipes again-It's A Long Way To The Top If You Want To Rock And Roll-However, considering today's airplay lists, this CD stands out like a diamond. We'll take it.But no Bag Pipes. Damn!"
3,Rawk is Back!,"Got the new AC/DC. I've got to give it the thumbs up. There are some really great songs on this album. They have returned to their hard rock/blues form of the late '70's, which is great. ""Hold Me Back"" uses a classic Angus ""For Those About To Rock"" riff that takes you right back to 1981 and ""Satellite Blues"" is the grittiest, best straight-ahead rock song they've written since ""Rock n Roll Damnation"". Brian Johnson has the vocal range of a pick-up on blocks, but you just can't replace a voice like that. There are a few clunkers on the album too, but what can you expect from a bunch of 50 year old's? At this point in their careers, this is probably the best rock album that they are capable of recording, and even if at times it's only a shadow of what they once were, that's still one hell of a reminder of what power-houses AC/DC can be when running on all of their hell-bent cylinders. And in the immortal words of Bon: ""Hell ain't a bad place to be!"""
4,Glad to have em back!,"I should start this review by saying that the first rock'n'roll record (yes record, I'm that old) that I ever bought was Back In Black, so that's my point of reference for AC/DC. Ultimately I've been disappointed with every album since then because fair or not, I'm always waiting for Back In Black II. That being said this is a very strong album. ""Meltdown"", ""Hold Me Back"", ""Can't Stand Still"" and ""Satellite Blues"" are classic AC/DC. The tempo in some of the songs is rather slow and I wish they would pick it up and rock a little more. The bottom line is that if you are already a fan of the band you should have this album, if you're new to the band, check out all of their material with Bon Scott and Back In Black before moving on to this one."
4,THAT IS IT!,"Once again AC/DC proved they are the best band all over the world! It is not an awesome albun,but it rocks! Angus once again is perfect,as all the others guys!Brian is great and full of energy!Listen to Stiff upeer Lip and you will understand what i mean! AC/DC...these guys rock!"
4,Back In roots,"I am a fun since my 15, I have all the albums and I love these guys. However I dont have a problem saying that 2 or 3 albums were worthless.OH MY GOD THEY ARE BACK!Stiff Upper Lip definetly a return to the roots. Its one of their top 5 albums.Well yes there is a lot of repetition and the lyrics arent too great... And so what?This is AC/DC as we always knew them and love them. If you want lyrics read poetry, if you want good AC/DC stuff....BUY STIFF UPPER LIP."
4,What a nice surprise!,"I didn't think the boys had another one left in them but this is pretty damm good. OK - it's not Highway to Hell or Back in Black, but what is. It's by far the best since the last classic ""For Those About To Rock"". Party on Angus. ""Let there be ROCK""!"
2,Just alright.,"Stiff Upper Lip is nothing quite that special. In its nearly 25 year history, AC/DC has never penned lyrics that are this bad. The repetition on tracks like SUL and House of Jazz reak of the creative flavor of say Back in Black or even Ballbreaker for that matter. AC/DC has slowed in pace and tends to shift more towards a blues flavor now, but for the most part it works well. ""Satelitte Blues"" tastes damn fine and probably is better than any track on Ballbreaker or Razors Edge, but the rest of the album is just plain uninspiring. Many fans are just happy to see AC/DC back from a 4-year recording hiatus, and there initial enthusiasm might skew their view on this new recording. Will this disk be in their players say a month from now? Bet on it, but it won't be taking the place of any Bon era CDs anytime soon."
5,"After 27 years, AC/DC still rules!","I read in a magazine recently that rock music is dead. I also read in another magazine that Korn is the future of rock. Well, as long as AC/DC is around, neither of those statements are true! Stiff Upper Lip is a great album; better than The Razor's Edge, and better than Who Made Who. In fact, it ranks up there with Highway To Hell and Back In Black as one of their best ever! As Angus Young said in a recent interview in Toronto, what we need is some of that good old, toe-tapping rock'n'roll, and that's what we get, and it still sounds just as good as it did when High Voltage came out back in 1973.PS. AC/DC will be around long after the Backstreet Boys lose their looks and their fans, and long after rap music finally dies (which will hopefully be soon! ) If you agree with me, tell me that my review was helpful by clicking YES!"
3,Mediocre ACDC - but it's still better than everyone else!,"This is a very typical ACDC album of the last fifteen years or so. Nothing to compare to the Bon Scott era or the Back In Black/ For Those About to Rock albums, but even at their worst this damn band is still better than anybody else -Metallica included. These guys are the kings, even if their songs are repetitive, lyrics dumb, and Angus' solos nothing fancy. This isn't a great album by their own high standards, but in this day and age of post-grunge pseudo-rock, ACDC still delivers with an honest Rock n Roll edge. There is a reason these guys have been around since 1973, and it's because of their simple yet rocking style. It's timeless. The last song Give It Up has a classic ACDC feel to it. If you're a diehard, add it to your collection. It's no Back in Black, but hey, what is?"
1,Flavored Sampler....This is a JOKE!,"I received 2 vanilla, 4 strawberry, 4 banana (All were LifeStyles). Those were the ONLY flavored condoms sent.I also received:10 LifeStyles colored condoms10 regular Durex condomsand 10 Unil@tex regular condomsSo I received 40 total condoms; but only 10 were flavored, they were all the same brand and there was only three different flavors. For someone who was ordering this to see if there were certain brands of flavored worth purchasing long term....this was a hugely failed purchase."
3,Fun entertainment for those who love animals,"If you're a dog-lover, you will appreciate the humor. It's not as good as the one with a title about Walking in Circles Before Lying Down."
5,Classic Metal/Classic Maiden,"It's difficult to pick a BEST Iron Maiden album, as each studio album from ""Number of the Beast"" to ""Seventh Son..."" has some special merit. However, I feel that this album (the first with the DEFINITIVE line up offers the most of what makes IM great. Sing-a-longs like ""The Trooper"" and ""Die With Your Boots On"" as well as epics ""Revelations"" and ""To Tame a Land"" offers a listener the range of Maidens abilities. The production may not be as sharp as ""Powerslave"" and ""Number of the Beast"" may have more notable tunes but for my money this is what Maiden is all about."
4,Good Maiden,"I'm not a major Maiden fan, but this is good stuff especially compared with all the contemporary rock out there. Maybe I'm getting to be a bit nostalgic here."
4,Pretty good,"I'm not a kid i just don't have an email adress. I think this iron maiden album is very well done but it gets old after awhile. Don't get me wrong it's awsome, I mean Trooper, Die with your boots on, you can't beat that, but I don't recomend it for your first maiden album. For your first choose between the first three albums: Iron Maiden, Killers, or Number of the beast.(and if you buy a maiden music book be careful about which books you choose cause some really SUCK!!!)"
1,"Great music, buy the other edition","This CD offers 17 tracks of terrific Red Army chorus music. However, if you buy the EMI reissue, you will receive everything on this disc plus five additionsl tracks at a much lower price."
3,Lighter than expected,"I'm wondering if I bought the right pot.....the one that America's Test Kitchen recommended. It's awfully light. Fine, but at the same weight I could have gone cheaper."
5,Great CD!,"This album captures the live energy of a band that is at it's best when it's on stage. Fun album and worth adding to the collection. RIP Ty Longley, Jeff Rader"
5,Outstanding Set,"I purchased this set to make new kitchen cabinet doors. I have a 3 1/2 HP router, table and router lift. This makes it a lot easier to dial in the exact height. Follow the instructions, make templates of the final pieces. You'll use them over and over again. Also I tried 1,2, and 3 cuts to final product. Found that on cherry 2 cuts were the best. You should try it out before you begin.So now after 6 months and 30 doors latter. They are still sharp and cutting like new. Very good set. I would recommend to anyone."
4,Honest Personal Experience....,It was great to read the honest personal experience of an adoption--both the positive and negative. This book provides a centralized source of helpful information on adoptions and could act as a valuable checklist for those adopting a toddler. I would recommend this book to anyone considering the adoption of a toddler or an international adoption.
5,Very Helpful Book!,"We are in the process of considering international adoption. This book is great as a quick reference for differences in international cultures, measurements, etc as well as a quick overview how-to for first time parents of toddlers. I recommend it!"
4,Well-made leather case that is a must to protect your phone!,"I ordered this case to fit my 6160 Nokia phone. Since it is a Nokia product, I expected quality and got just that; the stitching is straight, and the case fits like a glove. As a matter of fact, the case is actually very snug (probably to allow for the leather to stretch [over time] and still properly fit the phone), so I found it a bit of a struggle to unzip and zip the phone. If all you plan to do is plug the wall charger into the phone, you'll be all set since there is an opening for the adapter to be plugged in without unzipping the case.The belt clip is very nice. It's leather-covered, doesn't protrude much beyond the case, and securely fastens the phone to your belt. If you don't need a wrist strap, this is a good case to protect that cell phone investment!"
4,Good buy for mixing,"one version which is in the single is very good. the more you listen to it, the more you like it. I like it because its a vocal but it also has a good beat to it. it mixes well with trance."
4,Difficult at times.,Faulkner does take your full attention to understand his writing but I would recommend it read as a series as it's intended.
1,Very high chances of dropping the phone,I am not at all happy with the case. It has not been designed to make sure that the phone does not fall off. It can slip easily when you sit.
4,Other Books,"A really interesting book, and hypothesis. I first noticed this theory, funnily enough, after watching the excellent miniseries 'Edge of Darkness' and some of the writing involved with talking about that show. Well worth a look. The Earth as 'living' in the sense of a being a system, where life and the planet exist in a relationship. This is definitely a thought provoking piece of work."
4,Great music,"This is really some quality music from two girls who have been friends since they were young. Marion and Marit are definatly talented girls who write most of their own songs! They have some very good and uplifting lyrics that will make you want to dance. My favorite is Girl In YOur Dreams where they are basicly saying to this guy, "" Look I like you even if I'm not the one in your dreams."" I thing M2M will progress in their music and be around for years to come."
5,This CD rocks the household!!!!!,Me and my friend have an ongoing cd giving gift thing. This was one I gave her. We both know the words to all the songs and they rock!
5,M2M are the best,"I think all of there songs are great. I think they are both very talented in many ways. My favorite songs are ""dont say you love me"" and ""mirror mirror"" but al there songs are the best. I saw them on ""all that"" on nick and i just loved them at first sight. And when they came back snick i was so happy. They are the coolest."
3,This is about what Amazon send to me,"I am the last one who bought this Cd then no stock. Amazon send me a typical CDR with ink jet print booklet and state that the copyright was on 2000 and 2012 for permission distributed as CDR. Why don't you notice us on the information page? Really disappointed.However, all song is great at my own youth. I actually love them all!!!"
4,A Worthy Ruler?,"There is a theme in Chinese culture, myth, legends, fantasy, folktales, fairy tales which speaks to a ruler's expected conduct and what results occur. Additionally the importance of the acquisition of knowledge and being industrious. The story of the tiny princess is atypical with many tidbits. The story can grow with repeated readings. It can be as simple or complex as fits one's time in life."
4,Victorian Doll Family,These dolls are sweet and well made. She likes taking their jackets off and that sort of thing which is a nice feature too. My only negative comment is that they are difficult for my daughter to bend them into position. If they were a wee bit more malleable that would be helpful.
1,review,This product may look fun but it is basically a couple pieces of plastic with scraps of fabric glued on. i would never recomend this product and i doubt that these were really hand painted.
3,hard to position,I bought these to go with the M&D fold and go dollhouse. They have a nice look to them and despite other reviews my daughter was able to get some of the clothes off. They fit nicely with the dollhouse. I bought them because I wanted a complete family for the dollhouse. They are very difficult to bend to position.
2,So tired of tugging at it,"I love the look of this bra when it stays in place, which isn't for long. The front strap around the midsection keeps riding up underneath the girls and then makes them look funny...like they are hanging down. If they had a stiffer material so that you don't have to keep pulling down the front, it would be perfect. The look and feel of the bra is wonderful as long as you keep tugging at the front to pull it back in place :("
5,Sexy comfort,I purchased this bra because being top heavy underwire bras are sometimes uncomfortable. This bra is very comfortable and very supportive of the girls.i wish this bra came in other colores for dd girls. I will purchase this bra again and would recommend to friends .
3,Torpedoes,"I agree with the other reviews that say it is like going back to the 50s. It is very comfortable and holds them apart nicely. The promblem is that under a t-shirt, you will have torpedoes. If you like that look, this is the bra for you."
1,No all it's hyped up to be...,"Not sure why it's called double support bra, because there is no support. The straps do not stay in place causing the girls to drop....so will not reccommend to anyone if they are REALLY LOOKing for SuPpOrT."
3,Bra Slides Are Cheap Plastic Now,"The piece that the bra straps slides up & down used to be made of metal, but within the past couple of years Bali changed it to thin plastic that breaks within 5 washings if your're lucky. This basically ruins the bra,i've tried to gerryrig something, forget it. Bali does not sell any replacement pieces or fix it kits. So far the only thing I found was a store on the internet & so far having a difficult time ordering from them.Needless to say, I am VERY disappointed! For about 15 years this was MY bra, lmost knew this bra down to the serial number, devoted! Unfortunately Bali doesn't share the same feeling, seems like they are only interested in shortening the life of there product so they can sell more.Know I have to look for another bra that's similar, hopefully it's made a little bit better than this one."
5,Bali Double Support All over Stretch Bra,This is a wonder product and I think it is the best fitting bra that I have. It is very comfortable and offers a lot of support. I would highly recommend this bra to anyone looking for those qualities in a bra.
2,Fire the torpedoes!,"I modeled this bra for my husband and he agreed it gave me a rather pointy silhouette, nothing like what was pictured (though that may have more do with the difference in bust size between myself and the model). The support is adequate and the bra wears comfortably, but I'll feel self-conscious in anything form-fitting. I usually fit a 36D to DD, depending on the brand (in Bali models, typically D), so maybe a bigger cup would help. But, I suspect this problem is inherent in the design of the bra itself. It may also be worth noting, though the bra is listed as ""wire-free,"" there is a plastic band running vertically on the lateral edge of each cup. It's flexible and doesn't bother me, but might be a problem for others."
3,Fit is too big,"If you buy this, order a size smaller all around. Bands and cups were too big. I ordered the same size Playtex Secrets Side Smoothing Full Figure Wirefree Bra and it fit PERFECTLY! Much happier with the less expensive Playtex."
5,bravissimo!,"Father Owen Lee, famous to so many grateful listeners over the decades of Metropolitan Opera broadcasts for his pitch-perfect reflections on opera composers and their works, now does the same for orchestral music. In this handy, invitating volume, complete with illustrative CDs, he offers us a lifetime of rewarding listening. It might well have been titled ""An Opera Lover's Guide to Orchestral Music""---Bravissimo!"
1,What happen?,"Anne Rice you should have done what Michael Jordan should have done, retire as the greatest; instead you have ended the wonderful saga of the Vampire Chronicles in shame and embarrassement. I love you Anne, but I'm so dissapointed."
5,Blood Canticle,I have now concluded the entire group and enjoyed every book. Each vampire has told their story and without killing off anybody except for food. They don't sparkle like modern day vampires but they are a lot more enjoyable. Anne is the best.
2,Did Anne Rice even write this book?,"Seriously, did she write this book or [...] I was just waiting for Lestat to call something ""da bomb"" after he used the word ""cool"" for the tenth million time. And what happened to Mona? She certainly turned into a whiny cardboard copy teenager. I have been a huge fan of Anne Rice and own everything she ever wrote, including books under her other names. This was just a horrible let down, like she didn't even want to write it. And by page 200, I didn't want to read it. I had to push myself through the pages. Someone needs to tell this woman when the book is this bad. It discredits her name. It discredits the editor. And the only reason it's in print is because it has her name one it. I still refuse to believe she wrote it.In this book are some of the best characters created in the 20th century and they were destroyed. What a horrible end to the Mayfairs and the Vampires."
4,Pleasantly surprised after reading reviews,"I have read all of Anne Rice's Vampire Chronicles. My favorite is probably Pandora, because it was the first one I read and I fell in love with the characters and loved the way it was written. Once you have read an Anne Rice book - it is hard to read other modern day fiction. I was about to order this book when I started to read all of the reviews - I ended up ordering something else - everyone seemed so disappointed. Well, I finally borrowed the book from the library and absolutely enjoyed it. I wouldn't say its my favorite - but if you enjoy Anne Rice novels, you will enjoy this one. Just my opinion."
1,"Blah, Blah, Blah, Blah, Blah","Taltos, shmaltos, who cares about these evolutionary deadend salamanders. God has Lestat turned into a bore of a vampire. Do us a favor Lestat fly into the sun. Anne Rice has taken a great franchise and turned it into a loser. And these Mayfairs, what a bunch of dreary people they have turned out to be. Especially that Mona, pining away over her mutant daughter Morrigan, hoping that Mother and Father can be brought back out of the deep freeze. Oh for the good old days of the Vampire Chronicles!"
4,Loyal Fan,"I am a bit mad at the fact that this is the last chronicle but I really cant believe that, even if she says it is so; she left it all too unfinished.I lived through menoch the devil and I can live through this. . . i hope. Sorry if i have made any of you mad but honestly i dont care!"
1,what a shame,"Rice's novels use to hold me captive. I could sit for hours reading her works as if they were made from fine wine (gee I sound like Lestat now). Since MEMNOCH THE DEVIL the Vampire Chronicles have gone down hill. Except for PANDORA and VICTORRIO, the other installments are the same story over and over again. The Armand and Marius based books are the same minus a handful of chapters and both repeating stories already told in THE VAMPIRE LESTAT. Now with this addition we have to go through BLACKWOOD FARM again. And Why do we have to go through the history of Taltos again? I was very disappointed. I loved the WITCHING HOUR. I is my favorite! But now the characters of Rowan and Michael seem so fake so not what they used to be. Sadly this book was a disappointment."
3,Something missing....,"Many others hated this book, but I personally did not find it that bad. It's not the worst book in the series, but it definitely isn't Rice's best. My major problem with the novel is that it doesn't resolve the Vampire Chronicles to me, focusing more on the Mayfair saga. There is no true resolution given between Lestat and the other vampire characters, which I think should have been done in order for this to have been a proper finale to the series."
2,Not the Anne Rice I'm used to,"I'm sorry to say that this book just wasn't Anne's best work. I've grown to love her stories, but this one just has me reeling. I'm not sure if it was the loss of her husband or what the problem is, but this one just doesn't seem like ""her"". Even so, I'm looking forward to seeing what she does next."
1,...vampire catholicism...say good bye...,...its no longer about being an Outsider but being a good Catholic[even Memnoch could rebel]Lestat/Armand & Marius can confess their sin & guilt but it only looked good on Louis...those 3 vampires--L & A & M are so flat now she should have left Lestat shattered & that would be better----to me---her obnoxious god & jesus forces away the Hindu/the Buddhist/the Bright[atheisist]& pagan readers/not to mention the goth/spooky kids out there....in her-god has a box & has made our vampires stupid/saints---who know not freedom-nor liberation/but guilt & the story falls into a mess after that/this is not for you or me but only the good vampire catholic only---for us we have her/his 1st books & that is it/ & we say good bye to the Undead hero of our dreams...may the devil's road bring you back you us someday...
2,Not a Fitting Ending to a Wonderful Series,"I would have rated this novel higher if it had not been the series finale. The tone of ""Lestat"" was all wrong. His voice and narration felt forced, the plot was OK but lack oomph, and the characters were lackluster.I ended up feeling like Rice wanted to end the series and did so in a rushed fashion. I understand that Ms. Rice's husband died around the time this novel was written. Understandably, her frame of mind wasn't in writing mode. I am not faulting her for that. I just think she should have waited until she could give the series a proper send off."
2,Remind me its only 368 pages,"I'm in 8th grade, and usually enjoy reading Iris Johansen's work, but this was a huge disappointment.First of all, I had trouble getting into the story to begin with, it all happened so fast, without much detail. A few parts of suspense lasted for like a page, is the only thing good about this book. When I hit the 200th page I threw it at the wall and hoped to God it would end soon. I do not recommend this book."
3,Big Snooze TIme,"I have been an avid reader of Iris Johansen for years and as the Eve Duncan series went on, it seemed the books got better. I was sadly disappointed in this book. I had hopes that is would continue along the lines with Sarah and Monty helping in rescues. My mistake was when I read an excerpt of this book and it was talking about Sarah and Monty at a rescue scene I thought that's who the book would be about. I was also hoping it would have something about Eve Duncan and Joe somewhere in the book. I lent it to a friend and she keeps asking me when its going to get good, it's a very slow read and disappointing one at best. Her previous book No One To Trust was also lacking, but that's another review. Maybe the time to wind up the Eve Duncan series is overdue."
1,Dead Aim CD,"I am so thankful I checked out this book on CD from the library rather than buying it. The narrator is terrible. She reads in a sort of low monotone voice. It's sad when a good book is narrated by a terrible narrator. I didn't get too far though before I realized this is not a good book anyway, so no big loss. If you want to hear a great narrator, try Sue Grafton's alphabet mysteries read by Judy Kaye. She is the best! I love to read, but I would almost rather hear Judy Kaye read these than read them myself."
3,rigid when you fold them out,"I got yellow, seem cheap but may last 1 year or so. They become rigid when you fold them out then you ""slap"" them onto your ankle, wrist, forehead, etc. I have yet to see if they are reflective up to 1500 feet as stated with car lights. Material complies with ANSI 107-2004 (traffic visibilty code) so they must be decent at least. Probably doesn't hurt to have them around you when riding a bike.Sunlite LED Taillight TL-L500 Bike Bicyce"
4,Basic Information,This book gives you a good foundation for putting colors and yarns together. It isn't exactly what I was looking for but it was interesting to read.
5,Great Receiver,"I've been very pleased with this receiver. It had all of the functionality that I needed to connect it in a pretty complex scenario. I'm having a small problem with the HDMI video in that I seem to have some lines on the top or side, but I'm not sure if it's the cable or the receiver."
4,"Great value, but CLICKS","This is a good receiver for the money and I purchased it after doing a fair amount of research. However, if you are going to use this with HDMI be warned that the unit 'clicks' quite a few times as it negotiates the proper HDMI signal from the component to the TV. For example, when playing a Blu-Ray movie using a PS3 the unit will typically 'click' about 8 times before the movie kicks in... this is NOT the fault of the PS3. The click is the sound of the internal hardware relay... pretty bad design in my opinion but everything else works as advertised... not sure if I'm going to keep the unit, but I will give it 4 stars as it does what it advertises to do."
2,"Great Start, Awful Finish","The first 45 minutes of this was a very, very pleasant surprise. That's probably because I read so many negative things about this film, I was expecting the worst. I was enthused, even heading into the second hour but as time went on I began to become less involved with the story. That's probably because none of the characters are likable people that I would care about. With no one to really root for, after awhile the movie loses its appeal.The worst part was the last 20 minutes. It was so sordid, it got absurd. It's too much corruption, sick people, ugly violence and nasty overall attitude. The ""Linscott"" family is so bad I could do little but just shake my head in disgust. The whole thing wound up too depressing. When it's over, you want to take a shower.I loved the cinematography and overall 1940s film noir atmosphere. On that aspect alone, this movie almost was a keeper until they went overboard on the seedy stuff in the last 20 minutes. What a shame."
3,Misleading,"This movie was pretty good, but it was very misleading. It wasn't about Elizabeth Short, who was known as the Black Dahlia. It was more about two cops obsessed with catching her killer. There were also a lot of other sub-plots. Weird relationship between the three leads, the two policemen and the girlfriend of one of the policeman. Both of the cops were so obsessed with getting the bad guys that they crossed the line into illegalities and murder."
2,Collapses after a great start,"We had heard all the criticism of this film, but being lovers of 1930-1940 era stories, we decided to give it our own try.During the first 30 minutes, we were saying to ourselves.... ""Hey this is really good, what is all the criticism about ?""BUT........ then it hit..... at the 31 minute mark the film hit a brick wall, fell apart and became a burden of chaotic boredom to watch.At 88 minutes we finally gave up and hit EJECT !Summary.. Excellent 40's era sets and costumes.... a great moody atmosphere.Weakness = story, pacing, character development."
2,"""She looks just like that dead girl!""","The Black Dahlia is a great book but a bad movie. The actors in this film are going to take a lot of heat, but that is unfair; when all the performances are bad, it's the fault of the director. Some people are calling for Brian DePalma to retire and, on the basis of this film, they may have a point. It's not just that it's bad, it's aggressively bad - the kind of bad that takes real work. The audience I saw this with was laughing through the whole thing. Indeed, it is the type of film that Mystery Science Theater 3000 would appreciate. The only thing I can think of was that DePalma was trying to parody the conventions of noir: the tough guy detective lead, the voice-over narration, the over-the top acting and dialogue. The trouble is, it doesn't come off as tongue-in-cheek - it just comes off as bad. The only actor who really does a good job with her part is Hilary Swank - because she does play it for laughs."
5,"""Outstanding""","""The Black Dahlia"" deals with the murder of a beautiful Hollywood starlet at a time when Tinsel Town was an innocent and thriving community. The movie was based on the actual death of Elizabeth Short. This murder is investigated by two hunky police detectives, played by studs Josh Hartnett and Aaron Eckhart, who find their lives twisted and turned upside down as they try to find answers as to why anyone would want to kill a beautiful woman. Both will also not be satisfied until they find the culprit. Both Hilary Swank and Scarlett Johansson give outstanding supporting performances. There are over 40 minutes of bonus features that deal with the actual death of the Black Dahlia. Brian DePalma, the film's director, is interviewed. Unfortunately, the movie was both a critical and commercial failure"
1,Terrible,What a waste of time and money. The bad acting didn't help. But I guess I should have known that anything with Josh Harnett is going to be bad. It's an unsolved mystery so there is no twist or anything. Very hard to follow because it's so slow.
2,Poor effort by DePalma,"It is hard to believe that Brian DePalma directed this film. The best thing that you can say about the film is that the period sets, clothes and language are well done. Unfortunately, the film is grossly miscast, terribly confusing and the title is misleading. The Black Dahlia murder is almost a mere footnote in this film. Most of the story focuses on the lives of 2 cops that stumble into the Dahlia crime scene. Josh Hartnett just wanders through the film and Hilary Swank is horribly miscast as a femme fatale. The plot is so confusing that, by the end of the film, you just want all the characters to die. This film makes your brain hurt. Sorry, Brian."
1,Not What I Expected,"I am a big fan of true crime stories. I was afraid to watch this movie due to how gory the real case was, but I thought I'd give it a shot - I found the case facts fascinating.Unfortunately, the movie was incredibly boring. I could only sit through half an hour before I had to turn it off - I hardly ever do that. Even if a movie is bad, I tend to sit through it just so I can say I watched the whole thing. But this movie was SO slow and confusing and just totally bizarre.The way it was filmed and cut together made no sense to me and it hardly even dealt with the murder; it was more about some moron cop. I'd rather hear about the killer. I don't recommend this movie at all and I'm surprised anyone else could sit through it, let alone give it a five-star rating.If you're anything like me - a true crime lover - steer clear of this movie."
2,Slumming Streets Of Hollywood,"Take Raymond Chandler's noir ""slumming streets"" of 1940s Los Angeles, a few tough cops who may or may not be ""on the take"", more ""dishy"" dames than you can take a stick at all trying to make their way to Hollywood's big time, big screen any way they can. Throw in money, sexual desire, sexual perversion, some stolen scenes from other noir films and you have ""Black Dahlia"". No, not Chandler's ""Blue Dahlia"" there is too much visual, up-front violence, too little worthy dialogue, and too little character development for that but all the other elements are there to produce an some what entertaining mystery that will keep you guessing a little, if you can keep your eyes off those ""dishy"" dames, Hilary Swank and Scarlett Johansson, (or, depending on your preference, those ""dishy"" guys ). That in the end is probably the reason to see this thing. It does have that great `40s background music to set the mood, though. You know, if you are a noir fan what I mean."
1,"Awful, Awful, Awful",I gave this movie 1 star because I was unable to give it negative stars. This story has VERY little to do with the Black Dahlia. Naming it that it that was merely the hook (false hook at that) to generate interest!
1,The Wilted Dahlia,"What a waste of my senior discount movie ticket! This is one of the worst movies I have seen in years.This movie was also a waste of good talent. I kept waiting for a good plot but the Black Dahlia began to appear as an ""also ran"".I enjoyed the old noirs of the 40's more than this movie. The title would lead you to believe that the plot was the pursuit of Elizabeth Short's killer. Not so. Just the love lives of two cops in a warm climate. I am still confused as to what that movie was trying to tell.Maybe DON'T add the Black Dahlia to my massive movie collection when the DVD comes out."
3,Not great but it is not as bad as people say,"It is not great but it is not as bad as some people are saying. Why the movie is not great is because it spends to many moments teasing with clues that lead nowhere. If you have read the book you will notice that it is done okay, but there are some parts missing. The parts missing set up a lot more of the story from the victim and her background. This movie just jumps into a storm of chaos and I did not like that part. Josh Hartnett's portrayal of Bucky was so-so. I did think that the girl from Million dollar baby was okay. They did not do a good job with some of the timeline when they were involving Lee's nemesis. The movie does a good job of providing a staunch, detective type atmosphere in the 1940's L.A. area."
2,"Looks good, but nothing more","What a disappointment. The film looks great, but that's about all that can be said about it. None of the major actors are convincing as mid-1940s characters - they are just people who have dressed up in costumes, but, don't have any sense of the period. Everything about them screams 2006. Brian de Palma has made his share of unsuccessful films, but until now at least they were all interesting. The script is confusing (is it a flashback or not?), there are all kinds of side stories, and it's only at the end that the director and writer suddenly remember that they are supposed to be making a film based on a real killing, and hurriedly come up with as contrived an ending as one might ever see."
4,DAMM GOOD METAL,"When i first saw this cd i was slighty put off by the cover, i had stupify on a nother album and i was interested to know what the album sounded like. Anyway after a grilling at a local cd store i finally decided to buy it only lisening to half of the album, i got home and was dissapointed will the second half with lirics like (droppin plates on your ass) which made me go off the album. Even though the second half from songs 9-12 are quite rubbish i would recomend this album to anybody ( watch out for songs like VOICES, THE GAME, DOWN WITH THE SICKNESS AND STUPIFY which are top class songs!!!!!! and by the way check out buckcherry if u like punk rock, your in for a treat."
5,are you down with the sickness,when i bought this album i didnt know what to expect i actualy bought belive before i bought this one i was amazed when i listened to itvoices:good starting song with a good sound 8/10game:slow start good beet real good song 9/10stupify:real good song period 10/10down with the sickness:this is an awsome song best disterbed song made 10/10the rest of the cd is good this is over all a clasic cd a little off melody but still a great cd
4,"bob ""mcjaggar"" macca (nz)","This album has awesome music & David Dramain (I think that's his name) is probably the best lead singer I've ever heard!My personal favourites from this album include:Voices (10/10)Stupify (7/10)Shout 2000 (7/10)The Game (10/10)...and that's being a hard marker!I recommend that anyone who is into hard rock / heavy metal should buy this album, I give this my personal ""thumbs up!""Also, for you WWF fans: this is the band that performed Stone Cold Steve Austin's theme music Glass Shatters (""Step up! Cause you're the next one in line for the kill! You don't believe me but I'm betting that you will!"") DISTURBED RULZ!!!"
1,Not so great cd... why do people like it?!?!?,"i mean yeah... the first time i heard stupify i thought it was pretty good, but then it really got on my nerves and it was really overplayed. All the songs sound the same and get really boring after a while. Its good at first, but then it really gets on your nerves."
1,This is just bad.,"Here is another album of guys who want to try and show how angry they can be. The bad thing about this is that there is no substance to it. Just because you can shout profanities doesn't mean your music is going to be good.""Stupify"" is getting the airplay right now. I would not be surprised to see these guys disappear like many other hate bands. This is just noise and nothing more."
5,DISTURBED IS THE BEST NEW THING OUT THERE!,"Disturbed is by far the best new rock band. When I first heard ""Stupify"" on the radio I wondered who these people were. I did some research on the internet and found the 4 person band was Disturbed. I bought the CD right away and listened. The 12-song CD is packed with powerful lyrics, good messages, tight bass playing by Fuzz, and a very unique style of singing by frontman Dan Draiman. All 12 songs are great and are unique in their own way. If you like hard rock and buying a new CD, buy The Sickness by Disturbed! The Sickness is 45 minutes of great music that all rock listeners must have in their CD collection! The CD will boost your energy and your adrenaline will be pumping once you listen to this CD, I guarentee it! Buy THE SICKNESS by DISTURBED today, what are you waiting for?"
2,This Still Makes Me Sick...,"I've recently attempted to listen to this album again and I still don't like it. I'm into nu metal and raw emotions as much as the next person but screaming essentially every track doesn't show emotion but instead a lack of vocal ability. Also, the lyrics to the songs are extremely repetitious and seem good on the first listen but listen one more time and you'll grow tired of it. I really do like the band Disturbed, particularly the new album Believe, but this debut lacked diversity and control needed to make it an awesome break out. Raw emotion doesn't eminate from screaming all the time but instead from a combination of highs and lows, not just pure hatred screaming anger. Overall, this album just made me plain sick but I do still stay true to Disturbed and highly recommend Believe."
1,Complete Garbage,"Horrible vocals. Boring music. Cliche lyrics. In one of the most horrible trends in the history of music(Nu Metal), this is the bottom of the barrel. Avoid them at all costs unless you are one of the unfortunate people that listens to this junk that tries to pass itself off as real metal, when it is in fact soulless corporate rock garbage. If you want real metal, just pick you up a Slayer, Pantera, or even a Slipknot CD. Don't listen to this and support this Nu Metal fad..lets kill this off as quick as possible."
1,Yeah it does make me sick,Ooooh...These guys are so disturbed. I can just feel the anger coming through my speakers. These guys are here to save rock. Awww man...I forgot who I was talking about for a second there. This band is terrible. I've made my peace.
4,"Excellent Debut, However BELIEVE Promises To Be Better","Alright, with the release of Believe in a little over a week, I finally am taking the time to write a review of The Sickness. Many people criticize bands for not being original. I think that's a ... horrible thing to say. Music has been around for so many years that it's hard to make music that hasn't been done before. Disturbed has made a great debut, however a little more diversity between songs would be good. Every song is good, however I find it hard to listen to the whole album because they sound so much alike. That's what I took a star off for. Also, Draiman doesn't use his singing voice very much on this album, something that changes on Believe. I have listened to three tracks of Believe and think it will be the greatest album of 2002. Everyone buy it."
2,Hard to listen to while trying to keep a straight face!,"I like Disturbed. ""Believe"" Disturbed! But not ""Sickness"" Disturbed. Because this album is a waste of ""funds!"" I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. If you want Disturbed, stay away from this and pick up the new album ""Believe"" because it is much much better!"
3,Great,This Cd rocks for the first seven songs then slows. My fav. song is Voices its fast and hard. And i like Violence Fetish I listen to it before football games to get pumped up and focused. All and all a good buy but after Numb its a dip in quilaty.
4,If you like headaches......Its Great,"Disturbed have made a name for themselves with there fast paced, aggressive, in your face sounds. This album is all of those things, they don't let up.I think in some places they have gone a bit to far with the profanity (the end of down with the sickness) in their music but that's what sells records these days. But when you buy a disturbed album that's what your wanting, aggressive music, and believe me that's what you get with these guys. This album spews out energy and its hard not to get motivated by it, it's not for everyone but if you're one of those people that likes it, you're going to love it.4 Stars"
1,Skip it,"Sorry, I just don't get what's so great about Disturbed. Most of the album is filler (e.g., Dropping Plates, Fetish for Violence). Even the few catchy songs get boring after a few listens. People who think Drowning Pool or Korn are heavy bands might like this, but if you're looking for REAL talent and musicianship skip this and go buy some Tool."
5,disturbed-the sickness,"One of the best electronic-metal albums ever. If you like bands like Static-X or Linkin Park, you'll love Disturbed. I like 8 out of 12 songs on this album (""Voices""3/5,""The Game""4/5, ""Stupify""5/5,""Down With The Sickness""5/5,""Violence Fetish""4/5,""Fear""4/5,""Conflict""3/5, & Droppin' Plates""5/5). Overall, this CD is very, very good and any metal lover will like it."
3,"Not a Masterpiece, but worth having","""Stupify"" was the first song I heard from this disc on the radio which is a good song but seemed to get boring a little quicker than other radio hits. The rest of the disc was a nice piece of metal work, though. ""Voices"" is extremely tight and powerful delivering on all ends as well as ""Down W/The Sickness"" showing it's potential to be a mosh pit favorite & ""Shout 2000"" showing just how cool this album is. But I gotta say that the vocal stylings are a little 'different'. The phlegm hawking noise that seems to be this guy's trademark can be a little ""Disturbing"" at times for an otherwise good band."
5,Norman Connors Has Stepped Up To Another Level,"Norman Connors has truly outdone himself with his new CD, Eternity. The first track, ""So Hard To Say Goodbye"", was written by Gerald Albright who also plays lead saxaphone. This tremendous cut sets the pace for a CD that does not have a bad song on it. It includes a credible remake of Connors' original ""You Are My Starship"" which is sung by Peabo Bryson. The rest of the CD features a very smooth mixture of instumentals and vocal arrangements that will please anyone that knows anything about progressive jazz. Other guest artists featured include Angela Bofill, Marion Meadows, and Bobby Lyle to name a few. Connors has obviously put a lot of thought and time into this production and it has culminated into his pinnacle effort."
4,Memories,"This CD brought back memories of my father who often told me how he listened to Vaughn Monroe during WWII. When I listen, I can somehow imagine my father enjoying some brief moments while the war went on around him. Very enjoyable and nostalgic but not maudlin."
2,Van Halen's Worst,"This is the one Van Halen album that never should have been made. The fact that half of its songs are covers is bad enough, but most of the covers are poorly chosen, and of the originals, all but one or two are total crap. Avoid this album; in fact don't even ask for it for Christmas or Chanukah. I'm not."
4,"Cover tunes, but it's still Van Halen","Diver Down is only for serious Van Halen fans like myself. It's definitely not for the casual listener. The covers are good(much better than the originals). This one contains my two favaorite VH solos, ""Intruder"", avery different song, yet excellent. Dave does great vocal work on covers ""Pretty Woman"" and ""Dancin' in the Street"". Also, ""Little Guitars"" is a very catchy little tune. Overall, Diver Down is an aquired taste."
3,David Lee Roth,"Predictably up to par Van Halen album with David Lee Roth on vocals. Serves to broaden your horizons. There are five covers, five original songs and two instumentals. The covers are: Where Have All the Good Times Gone, (Oh) Pretty Woman, Dancing in the Street, Big Bad Bill and Happy trails. It's a decent album."
2,The Worst VH Album,"This is the quintessential filler album and the worst VH release of all time. There's only a handful of decent tracks on this album; these being: Hang 'Em High, The Full Bug, Little Guitars, and Cathedral. Dancing in the Street is simply atrocious. The less said about (Oh) Pretty Woman the better. I don't even know what to say about Big Bad Bill (Is Sweet William Now) - isn't this supposed to be a hard rock album? Happy Trails is just a waste of time. What were they thinking when they recorded this drivel?"
4,not bad,"its not a bad story actually,u just have to take time to read it and understand it..but its actually ok..they have a lot of characters in it and lots of people gettin tore up so its not bad...storyline could of been a little more in depth but hey its old give it a break.."
5,"""Why not be totally changed into fire?""","Abba Joseph once asked: ""Why not be totally changed into fire?""This disc brings a similar question to mind--Why can't all recordings be this unbelievable?This is one of the most beautiful discs in my entire collection. I have few that are as near to a realized ideal of perfection as this disc.The Borodin String Quartet's performance grips one at the outset with the dreamlike opening of Borodin's String Quartet No. 1 in A. It takes complete hold of the listener and does not let them go until the Finale of Borodin's String Quartet No. 2 in D.I cannot find words to describe this disc. I recommend it unreservedly. Get a copy today."
2,where is the price?,I was very interested in buying the aura-Soma cards. The price is not listed. I think that listing a price would be quiet helpful. Are they even still available?
2,Loved my first one,"I loved the first one of these I purchased. It was just wanted I needed, cleaned the stairs and was little hassle. I don't remember what happened, but part of it broke so we bought another both came from here. It's belt burned out within 10 minutes, exchanged it for another. This on the agitator would not spin right out of the box. Traded it in again. This time it lasted for 2 months before the belt burned through. Called to get a price for a new belt, but it was more expensive than the unit. I am now convinced that my first one was a fluke of quality."
5,Another new FAVORITE,"Diana Groe has captured me with her viking romances. Maidensong had me in tears many times feeling the heartache of the characters. I became edgy in the combat scenes, and uplifted in those tender moments. The only reason I had to put the book down so many times was because I was so taken by the emotions, that I had to give my poor heart a break.For an author to make me feel THAT intensely, . . . All I can say is BRAVA!If you like historical/norse romances, and if you LOVE Josie Litton's work, don't miss Maidensong! It is a true romance, with surprises, and twists that I have come to expect from such a talented author."
4,Completely approachable,From a pure novice's standpoing this book is gold. Clear instructions and straightforward recipes come together in amazingly sophisticated dishes. I almost feel guilty serving them to guests - feels like cheating somehow.
4,"Phiips Multiformat DVD - Efficient, Easy to use",Great if you want to be able to play PAL DVD format as well as those that work on most US machines. Very easy to set up and run. I love it!
3,Decent value but...,"Overall for the price this is a decent DVD player that does what it's advertised to do. Picture and sound quality are good and being able to watch divx encoded discs is nice. The only real problem is that it it's SLOW, it can take up to 30 seconds to start up and another 20 seconds or more to load a DVD. It can be very, very annoying. If you can live with the sluggish interface then overall it's a good DVD player for the price."
5,excellent region free dvd player,"Just got this dvd player and am very satisfied. I wanted a player for my British dvds (region 2). I followed H. A. Emet's instructions for making it region free. So easy and it works great! Just one thing I would add . . . when following the instructions, just enter the code like it says. Don't look for a box or anyplace on the screen for the code to fill---just push the buttons (138931) and the region code will appear. Like magic! I think this is a great little player for a great price. Buy it!"
1,Don't waste your money,"I received this one as a gift. When you try to open the tray, it opens and closes very quickly. You have to grab the tray and hold it to remove/insert a DVD/CD. It lasted about 2 years, then it only made a noise when I pushed the eject button. Time for a new DVD player. The picture and sound were fine, but this one never worked right, and didn't last very long."
5,Great Region Free DVD Player,"When I considered ordering this player, I noticed a lot of comments about the remote. I do want to confirm that the remote buttons ARE hard to use. You have to line the remote just right and press the buttons hard. However, I need to dispel the rumor that there is no way to open the DVD player drawer from the remote to insert a disc. You press ""Stop"", hold it for a few seconds, and the drawer opens. It closes the same way. The region free intructions provided by another Amazon customer DO work well, and I am gratfeul to him for posting those. The picture is really good; I have not experinced any skips or problems. So far, this is one of the best players I have owned yet. I highly recommend it."
2,Works - but not without a fight.....,"Works well - and good region free for the money. BUT if it were not for the previous post to free up the region, it was going back in the box for a return. What is the point of having region free if you can't change the region. There is no instructions on how to do that....stupid really.UPDATED July 2007Having used it now for 6 months I like the DVD player - the Divx Quality is excellent on the large 42 inch plasma.If I were to suggest improvements - the buttons on the machine are small and the remote seems to need to be right infront of the machine to make it work.it's cheap - it works and I haven't replaced it which must say soemthing."
4,Set Up A Bit Clunky,The set up on this machine is a bit clunky but after working through that the machine has worked well and has good video output. I have successfully used both prerecorded DVDs and home made photo CDs. Seems a good deal for the price.
4,Very good player for the money,"I bought this unit because my older model Toshiba player had problems playing DVD-R's and even some DVD's. This little guy plays everything! Not a fancy player and I agree that the remote is rudimentary, but I am still very pleased with my purchase. Good value for the money."
5,Excellent value,"Easy setup. Plays both PAL and NTSC on an NTSC monitor (the converter is built in), so ideal for those in the US looking for a dual format deck. And the numeric code available on the Internet through a variety of sites makes this a region free deck with just the push of a few buttons. Yes, the code works. I've set my deck to Region 0, so I can play anything. I bought to play Region 2 PAL Bionic Woman discs. Works like a charm, while still playing back all of my other discs. Deck is small, lightweight, and not aesthetically challenged."
2,Pretty disappointed in this DVD Player,"Hey for all you Amazon consumers out there, whether you like this or not, I really did not have a good experience with this DVD Player. I bought this device for the purpose of being able to play foreign DVD's from out of the US, and this electronic mechanism disappointed me greatly.I could not get smooth playback at all with the foreign DVD I tried to play. However, it does work good for DVD's made in the US.So if you have DVD's in the US only, this DVD player probably would be good for you -- but for any DVD's out the the country, this device was a piece of junk.So all my prospective consumers out there, based on what I have written, you be the judge a decide if the DVD player is right for you."
5,"plays everything, even divx and avi files!","An amazing (and amazingly low-cost) machine, capable of playing virtually any kind of video or music file downloadable today, right on your television and/or though your stereo. I was so impressed with it I got one for everyone in my (large) extended family! You will be more than satisfied."
4,Good buy for the money,"Not a bad player for the price. Just that I have to press the eject button 2-3x to get it to open and stop searching for a cd that is not in there when i first switch it on. Other than the initial slowness it is great. Nice slick, light weight design and the best part is that it can play foreign formats, some old vcd's i had too which i was impressed by."
5,Plays multiple formats AND regions,"As advertized the unit plays all the movies in various formats that I had at home (all of these formats were listed in product info). What is more important for me, it also plays ALL European movies (in various formats) which used to give me the usual ""wrong region"" message. The latter works only if you use the hack suggested by one of first reviewers. So remember to print that review and keep it with your manual."
3,defective upon arrival (if you need to return a product -please read),"defective unit upon arrival.. left a blank spot on my plasma tv in the same place.. with various dvds played.Attempting to return product as it is thru amazon .. had trouble printing out return upc code And the other one that you enclose in the return product.Pay attention to print both, (they appear similar but are different).My printer is fine as i had it diagnosed and amazon 's print page would not allow a good copy of either to be made..will try at library.getting to think buying local is better perhaps but gas went up to 3.45/gallonand have a good day yourself."
2,"If the gamble works, it's a great product!","This product can easily be made region-free (so ignore the $90 version listed here. :) )It also plays DTS movies despite the lack of logo on the box. Cool.So why do I complain? Simple. One of the two units I bought developed a problem that's been getting worse: The playback freezes for several seconds. All the discs I've played are clean; some new out of the packaging. I cleaned the player (using a new Philips brand DVD drive cleaner, no less!) and the problem remains. I think the internal servo-motor is starting to fail. (This is not a layer-switch pause; this is an entirely random situation and has happened on single-layer discs too.)I've had the failing unit for 4 months.It's only $50, but still. It's a lot of money to spend on cheaply made stuff. :("
1,Decieving Product Title,"I purchased this unit, because it stated that it could play DVD's from any world region, but this was not the case, as it only plays American DVD's. This cost me unecessary shipping costs, as I only got the return shipping costs free. I am still waiting for my reimbursement from AMAZON"
3,Pat Paulsen for President any body?,"Pat Paulsen was, apart from Alfred E. Neuman, one of the great comic Presidential candidates, and a very funny guy in an understated, dead pan brand of comedy. This is not the greatest TV skit show of all time, but it has aged well and you get to see ""Super Dave Osborne"" before he became famous for that role."
2,Not enough sparkle,"Although having written 26 books at the time this book was printed, this is only Ms Simmon's second historical. I am not familiar with her work, but this book felt trite and cliched to me.I found her virginal 24 year old heroine ordinary, and her duke was neither dangerous nor charming. There was some banter between them, but not enough to sparkle. The subplots were contrived and the so call secrets very easily discerned.This is not a book I would recommend, there are far better regency style (it's set in victorian times but has a regency feel to it) romances out there."
5,Memories from Shreveport,"When my mother-in-law was growing up in the 20's and 30's in Shreveport, LA, this book was considered the most authentic story of slavery and customs of the area. The other book by Lyle Saxon she remembers is ""Old Lousiana."" I'm ordering both for her."
1,Flowmaster Tailpipe,"Tailpipe came in 4 pieces with no clamps to connect them. The pipe did not match the original pipe in any way. The bend that goes over the axle was several inches too high, it will hit the underside of the truck. Each end of the pipe was way too long. I would have to cut several inches off each end. In conclusion this pipe was the correct general shape but would not fit without major alterations. I sent it back. End of story!"
5,The Best of absurd theater !!!!,"Ionesco's ""la cantantrice chauve"" (the Bald Soprano ) is one of absourd theater classic plays. It is a play that everybody who is interested in theater should read. with increadable characters and a unvilivable script, the Bald singer inmortalized Ionesco"
2,not for beginners,"If you're just starting to learn about wicca, don't delve into this book. I don't agree with the title: ""The Wicca Spellbook"". ""Wicca"" shouldn't even be in it. Wicca does not condone love spells like the one Gerina Dunwich suggests (the Aphrodite one), as it manipulates another person's free will. Also, a lot of herbs, such as Lucky Hand root, are hard to find. Please, read some material on the ethics of magick before reading this one."
3,Ups and downs...,"In this book it went from good to poor; then back to good. It had useful information in the back about the Sabbats and their associated herbs, colors, etc. Although some people I know thought that some of her spells were in violation of the Wiccan Rede, actually, it was actually doing what was best for both the practitioner and the ""victim"". You never know what could happen if that needed change did not happen...well, actually you do: violence! I enjoyed the mojo magick part and also the short, but good, section on wish magick. I hope that Ms. Dunwich will continue to write books on magick. --Jason Hoodoo Prractitioner"
1,Another example of desctructive literature!,"The publisher of this book and anyone who endorses it or sells is should be ashamed of themselves. It is very clear that the occult is present. Evil drips off of the pages. Please do not let your children read this kind of material. I will give it one star because this system won't allow me to rate it a ""0""."
2,Beginners: find another book!,"While this book might be considered a good reference for talismans (even though the author labeled all the talismans as amulets, when they were actually talismans), I would NOT recommend this book to even an advanced student. Reasons why: 1.) the author had some VERY questionable sources for this book, one of them being the author Sarah Lyddon Morrison. Ms. Morrison fancies herself a so-called ""satanic witch"" 2.) some of Ms. Dunwich's spells/potions violate the Rede, and from the ""About the Author"" page in the back, I know she hasn't been initiated into some form of ceremonial magick In short: get another book. I'd recommend Scott Cunningham."
3,Night,"True stories of this nature are always gripping.However, the delivery would not have compeld me to read it.I read it for a project."
4,"We need strong people, and authors, such as Elie Wiesel","Words do not seem capable of describing this book: I am generally of a pessimistic nature when it comes to humanity and, sadly perhaps, this book confirms how depraved, inhumane and heartless we can be -- and this was less than 70 years ago; not 100s or 1000s of years ago.It is not an 'enjoyable' read, for how could it be?, but a deeply profound, captivating and emotional read that I found hard to put down. In parts I thought it brief, but then could I have handled more? and I am thankful Elie Wiesel wrote what he did as I cannot imagine it was easy. The raw honesty of Elie Wiesel is to be commended, and cherished, and I am thankful he had the strength of character to write this and share with those of us who may feel removed from those times: may we never forget and may we strive to change [but I feel such events will, horridlyy, return]. We need the Elie Wiesels of this world to keep us on guard, as best and as much as we alone can do."
5,A Girl Like ME? read a book like THIS?,"As a 14 year old, you'd think that I'd be more interested in boys and makeup and what bands rock out loud. PSHH NO! You would never think that I'd be more into learning about the Holocaust than all of that other nonsense. I must say that I have just recentley ordered this book yesterday and may I say that I can't wait to get it! Ever since seeing him on Oprah, and learning that he has written 47 books! I just had to start somewhere. This will be my first Elie Wiesel book, I can't wait! Even though I haven't read it yet, I know more about the Holocaust than anyone in my family, including my grandpa (US Soldier during the 1940's - 1950's). Just from reading the back cover I'd give it 5 stars!"
4,Dark,"An agonizing contribution to the first-person testimonies of the Holocaust. The author's despair and hopelessness are deeply touching, and one can hardly bear to read about some of man's inhumanity to man (and woman and child). Wiesel asks, ""How could God allow such suffering?"" My guess is that most of those who lived through the same experiences must have had similar questions. I found myself sorrowing, and carrying a form of depression around with me long after I read this book. For me, the title was appropriate, as I felt dark and anguished while reading it. Not recommended for youth who are still struggling with emotional ups and downs. You need to read this when you have enough emotional resilience to be able to find hope and sunshine in today's world."
5,heart wrenching,"In this true account of a man who has lived trough one of history's biggest atrocity, you'll find a boy facing a cold world. Forced to grow up much too fast, he becomes a man, who has to ask the important questions and has to live with the answers no matter how vague and how inconclusive. I don't know how he still believes in God."
4,night,"i loved that it was a fast read. i thought the author got across the feeling of despair, the sadness of losing his family."
5,The book you will not forget,"Thanks G-d for Oprah! The book has been written a long time ago, but only now it got all the attention it really deserves.Similar to other Holocaust books, it is not an easy reading - but it does not simply plays on your emotions.""Night"" not only makes you cry, it makes you think and doubt. I have read the whole trilogy (""Night"", ""Dawn"" and ""Accident"") in two days and would recommend to everybody to continue with the trilogy, to see how the character and the philosophy are developing.""Night"" is one of the rare books I would always remember and think about - even though I would probably not re-read it, because of the strong emotional impact. The book was worth bying anyway, simlply because I would lend it to many of my friends."
5,truly a breath taking book,"this book was amazing. It has been a long time since I have read a book and not been able to put it down. It shows the effects of the Holocost in the most amazing perspective I have ever read. I am in the middle of the sequal and it too, is fantastic."
1,How can a just God allow unjust things to happen?,"(OOOOOOOOPS!!! My review has been posted and to my embarrassment I realize that I have made a MISTAKE. I wanted to give the book five stars instead of one. At this stage of editing I am unable to change the incorrect rating. But since I can add to the main body of the text I wanted to at least set the record straight. Sorry for the mistake.)Elie Wiesel is a genius. He makes you feel the horror of hatred. And yet he doesn't leave you in total despair as the book ends.All of us wonder how a just God can allow unjust things to happen on earth. Wiesel doesn't offer simple ""bumper sticker"" answers. But he does get us thnking.Another book I read this year, ""Christmas Gifts, Christmas Voices"" by John Allen similarly explores the question of bad things happening to good people.Both books are challenging, and at times so gut-wrenching that they are difficult to read. But they both offer valuable insights."
2,Not Up to Standard,I was not completely intrigued with the book. The book left some of the events for you to imagine yourself. It could have been more complete. I would not recommend this book to someone else.
5,Wiesel's simplicity is powerful,"This little book is one of the many accounts of life in the concentration camps during WWII, but is considerably different from some other accounts such as ""The Hiding Place"". Wiesel uses stark simplicity to tell his story, rather than extensive descriptives. It is, in fact, the very simplicity in which he brings you into the emotion of the story, that makes this such a brilliant book."
4,Night,"The story very enlightening and just like it was unbelievable for the author to experience it, it's unbelievable that people can be so cruel"
5,A must read,"For me this book was a horrifying read filled with images of destruction of life and the human soul. Wiesel's record of his experience in Auschwitz and Buchenwald caused me to question the depth of humanity's depravity towards one another. Also, you have to admire Wiesel's honesty in admitting his thoughts and the conflict he faced when dealing with his father. Most of us probably couldn't imagine doing such a thing towards our parents but when human existence has been whittled down to just surviving another day, I wonder how far we would go in Weisel's shoes.I read this book because it was referred to in an earlier book I read i.e. The Freedom Writer's Diary and I am not sorry that I read it. I recommend everyone to read it so that it might increase our awareness of what went on during the Holocaust and help us prevent similar events from happening."
2,Disappointing,"I have to agree with the other readers who gave this book a poor rating. At first, ""Night"" held my attention but then at some point (maybe around the half-way point), I started skimming over the pages and then completey lost interest altogether! It seemed very redundant and poorly written! Disappointed because I really had high expectations and wanted to like this book. I would like to learn more about the holecaust. Anyone out there have any good book suggestions?"
4,Correct Book Received on Time,"This book was for my son's school assignment. The only real tests this purchase had to pass were: Was the correct item (in this case, a book) sent, and was it sent on time. In this instance, the answers are ""yes,"" and ""yes."""
2,Night by Elie Wiesel,"This audio version does not follow the book that I teach my classes. It said ""unabridged"" so I assumed that meant nothing was deleted. The story remains the same, so if there was not a book present, it wouldn't make a difference. But, students cannot simply follow along to this version."
4,"gripping, relevant","Elie Wiesel's vivid cautionary tale of human atrocity touches at the core of the experience of men and the nation state at war. I think the book has more relevance than ever considering the extremes of human privation we must endure when faced with acts of barbarism and senseless slaughter. 'Night' could have been written in the context of genocides in Yugoslavia, or Rwanda, or Somalia, or Eritrea and proves it has withstood the test of time as a tale of the human spirit enduring in spite of a world gone horribly mad. I would recommend 'Night' to any high school class. Required reading as a tale of caution to those who think that they have slipped the excesses of the darkest human predations through some historic accident. 'Night' is a vivid and gripping portrait of the evil that men are capable of, and the triumph of the human spirit in the face of the worst barbarism."
3,Decent enough...,"Pro's:1)The sound quality is in-between fair and good enough, the problem is that there is a very subtle static noise, but it's not always there and when it is it is very subtle2)the size and weight, and the fact that it doesn't need a battery are great features.Cons:1) when it gets hot from being in the sun in your car the display becomes annoyingly painful to try to read, so plan on keeping it on one channel2) it seems that if it get's bumped around it will turn off momentarily, it also seems that when you play soft music, it tends to turn off also, so no opera or symphony.Summary:It's a great device for the price I paid. I believe that if the antenna on my car weren't at the back the static problem wouldn't be a problem. I simply gave three stars because of the quality and the fact that it turns off periodically."
4,My Love Life,"I was elated beyond compare with the first collection of Morrissey's first ten solo singles, and equally pleased to note the release of a second companion set. Beginning with one of his prettiest singles, ""My Love Life"", through the cuts from ""Your Arsenal"" and ""Vauxhall And I"", and the last few singles before ""Maladjusted"" rounds out the set quite nicely.In addition to the familiar a-sides and the hard-to-find b-sides, perhaps the most thrilling aspect of this set is that the cd sleeves duplicate all the original artwork the individual singles originally had. ""Hold On To Your Friends"" even replicates the gatefold design, replete with lyrics and a photograph of Morrissey."
5,Superb DTS quality,"The sepearation of sounds will make you feel like the musicians are all around you, especially if you emphasize the surround back speakers and slighty demphasize the front and center channels. Every instrument comes out its own speaker. Thia DVD really captures the essence of surround sound."
2,NO NO NO,"First off it is a good game but the glitches just like the DS version. Like someone said before you can't call you companions in to help well I could not use certain my spells. I gain 15 spells altogther and could only use a few. When I tried to select different spells my PSP FROZE AND SHUT OFF :(. This is why I give the game a 2, it a fun game but this glitch is killing me."
1,Another game of interest killed by to much difficulty,"This sounded like a good game, that is why I picked it up. I then played for a while and enjoyed the puzzle battles and fought the battles around the starting area. Then I smacked my head against the first boss again and again trying to get past. I raised my experience level a few times but still there was no getting past. I laid this game to rest to stop wasting my time. Best of luck to those who continue on this quest."
5,Great hard case!,I have used one of these for a number of years and it has always worked great. The best part is being able to carry my pocket pc actually in my pocket without damage.
1,Disappointing,"I found this novel disappointing, even somewhat offensive. The liberties taken with the lives of Sylvia, Ted, and Assia seemed in poor taste, and much of the ""poetic language"" of the book was forced and overwritten. I'm as much of a Hughes/Plath fan as anyone, and I enjoy reading biographical and analytical books about their relationship and respective poems, but this quasi-fictional rendition of their lives (especially so soon after Hughes's death) left me uncomfortable; the early sections describing Assia's ""coquettish"" youth were the most troublesome in this regard. Interested in Sylvia and Ted (the poets)? My advice is to buy Birthday Letters, the new Plath unabridged journals, or Rough Magic instead."
1,Boring,"It was boring to me, couldn't really keep up with it. Didn't hold my attention at all and I tried reading it a couple times."
4,"Hot book, good stories.",I enjoyed most of the book.... but by far the one I enjoyed most was the story by Betty Blue. *whew*!
5,This book will have your pet in your arms while you read!,"I would recomend Shiloh to any interested reader. It is a wonderful book and movie for the whole family. It is about a young boy named Marty Preston and his amazing dog Shiloh. Marty would give anything for shiloh and protects him like a million dollars. This book is an exhilerating adventure and filled with heartwarming joy. It is an extremely well written book that you can't put down! If you have seen the movie and haven't read the book or vice versa, I strongly recomend that you do because it is a whole new understand of the way it was meant to be. My favorite character was Shiloh because he was a sweet dog with a big heart. He is a bigger sap than my poodle! I guarantee that if you have a dog, he will be in your arms by the time you are done with the book!"
3,shiloh review,I thought the book was pretty good and because the book was about a dog named Shiloh and a kid named Marty and he saved Shiloh from a guy that abuses Shiloh and his other dogs.
3,Good Book!,"The book I am reviewing is Shiloh written by Phyllis Reynolds Naylor. I think this book deserves three stars. It is okay. This book is about a boy who finds a dog and the dog, Shiloh, doesn't want to go back to his original owner. Judd, the owner, is mean. The problem in the story is that his parents do not let Marty keep Shiloh. Judd is trying to find Shiloh and Marty is hiding him in his yard. I would recommend this book to a friend. Another book written by this author is The Fear Place.Emerson, NJ Fifth Grade Student"
3,"the best book review for""shiloh""","the book that i just put down was called""shiloh by phillis reynolds naylor. it was a really good book... at times. although in some parts that were pretty slow,long,and boring. i would rate this book with 3 stars.at times marty's mom reminds me of mine. Sarcastic, zuiet and really smart. His dad remindedd me somewhat of my dad, strict, loud but kind. It's a good book because it is easy to relate to. It is a great story for little kids."
2,a poorly written book!,"This book is a poorly written adventure. From the start you know that he is going to get the dog in the end. It is not an enjoyable reader its just a book torchering you to stop all the way through it. Its insigneficant charecters have no meaning they all seem to go against marty, and are all cruel. This is a book of pain, dont read it. It will waste your money and your time."
5,Heart warming and touching,This is the BEESSTT! book I have ever read. I definitely recommend this to whoever loves dogs. This book is sooooooooooooo AWESOME!THE END
5,Terrific! Magnifficent!,That was a terrific book! I think the plot was well thought out and I just loved the dedication that Marty had to Shiloh. You can really tell in Marty's thoughts and actions that he would do anything for Shiloh. And that's what tells me what is a good book or a bad book and in that case I think it was a great book!!! That was probably one of the best books I ever read. I would recommend this book to people of all ages.
5,Shiloh review for class,"This book evokes emotions of sadness and joy in the reader's heart. It helped me remember and connect with the feeling that we often need to take action no matter what the sacrifice. This book is appropriate for fourth through sixth grade. Math, geography, art, music, social studies, language arts, and science all can be easily incorporated into lessons taught on this book."
4,Shiloh,"Book review on ShilohBy a reader at Cutchogue east elementary schoolWhat if you found a dog out of nowhere and you could not keep him but you find out its your least favorite person Judd, the man with no feelings. Judd really disliked you that's what Marty's life is like. Marty is like every one else no money, poor town, boring parents, but he finds the perfect dog and takes it home at first it's a secret then the family knows and every one loves him, but they forgot one thing Judd. This book was written by Phyllis Naylor the book Shiloh is funny, sad, and, scary at times. The idea is getting Judd not to find Shiloh so he can't hurt him. In one part a German Sheppard attacked Shiloh so Marty came out and had to scare off the dog. Shiloh was breathing barely so the took Shiloh to a vet in 24 hours they would find out if Shiloh would survive. The theme was a happy at most parts some sad. I liked this book it was a happy and funny. I recommend this book to people who like reading short novels."
5,The best book!!!!!!!,"This book Shiloh is a really good book.If you love books about dogs then this is the book for you.Marty finds a dog on the streets,the dog come towards him when he wistled.Marty finds out that the dog belongs to a mean man named Judd Travers.Marty takes the dog away from Judd and names the dog Shiloh.Marty makes a dog pen for Shiloh,but the pen didn`t stop a german shepered from attacking Shiloh.Shiloh needed 25-30 sticheson his leg.Marty makes a deal with Judd so Marty can keep shiloh.Marty and Judd become really good friends."
4,Daughter enjoyed it,My daughter wrote a book report on this book and really enjoyed reading it. A good story for approximately 4th grade level
4,Elle s'appelle Sylvie Vartan.,"Born in Bulgaria in 1944, Sylvie Vartan's music career has long been the object of ridicule. She has been accused of being an inferior performer who couldn't sing and only became famous because of her husband, fellow musician Johnny Hallyday. Even so, despite her critics, her career has enjoyed a curious longevity, still surviving to this day. In my opinion, this CD proves Sylvie's merit. Though nothing especially deep, the light, bubbly, bouncy rhythms are catchy, and rather amusing, something you can really tap your feet to. When you abandon all need for aesthetics and meaning and just let yourself have some fun, Sylvie Vartan actually becomes a real treat."
3,"Add a half-star, please...","While this is not as wonderful as the same company's ""Outlaws, Renegades and Rogues"" (Songs of the Badman), as a sample of some fine bluegrass from the '60's by groups that mostly did not make it on the crossover charts, it still is worth hearing. As with the other Rural Rhythm disc I mentioned, Hylo Brown's tracks are one of the highlights here. However, none of the artists or songs are really weak. If you like bluegrass and do not feel your collection of it is large enough, this is a worthy addition. However, if you like traditional country and folk music, the ""Outlaws"" CD is simply a sensational value, and holds up well under much repeat listening."
4,Good read,Purchased this to read on vacation. It was a quick read that was at times insightful and other times humorous.
2,just average like what Spike Lee has become,"talk about a Cat who fell off in there Creativity?? Spike Lee was once known for making some interesting films such as Do the right thing&Malcolm x,but His ego,indulgences got the best of him.He has put out alot of films,but His best days have long ago been behind him.this Book never really says much about Him directly.He trys to come off more complex than he might actually be.I have always respected His Hustle,but this Book is about 10 years too late because spike Lee ain't been that kind of film-maker in ages.this book is just kinda there&that is how alot of spike lee's work has been to me after Malcom X came out. Hit&Alot of Miss."
2,slow moving book,I found this book to be a disappointment after the other two books I had read in this series.Too slow moving and too much repetition.I felt I had to read it to complete the first two but I could just as easily skipped it.
3,Part 2 of the Series,"This is a good series of fiction with history tied in, but I think so much of the focus being on a younger girl made it seem like it didn't tie in that well with the others in the series."
1,Horrible Construction,"The price and the picture say it all. Cheaply constructed. You get what you paid for...Do yourself a favor, invest in a GOOD hammock."
5,A light and beautiful version of this spectacular piece,"Of course there are about a billion versions of the Messiah out there, but this is definitely the best one I've heard. Unlike in some other versions I could name, the choir is very nimble and doesn't sound like everyone's mired in molasses. The soloists are wonderful and clear-- not heavy and overwrought like in some other versions, but skillfully adding ornamentation in the baroque style. The tempos are sprightly instead of ponderous. The only Messiah you need!"
3,Beautiful! but no classic,"One of the greatest artists of the century, Eric Clapton, finally droped his anticipated live album. The songs that he chose to perform on this set are very nice. This is full of Blues, R&b, pop, soul, all mixed togather. This is nice with my music collection. I enjoyed this very much. I hope he makes an ultimate greatest hits collection. I'm cop that fa sho' if he does. There are some nice songs here that I would sample for making beats and spitting verses on. Hot. A must own."
4,Very Good,"This has a lot of detail and organized information that a patent applicant might use. However, it does not provide an overview quite as well as something like ""Patents for Beginners"" (PfB). For patent applicants, I would recommend getting both books, but someone like a jurist or an expert witness might be better served by PfB."
5,Photojournalism: The original and the best,"As others have noted, this book was the beginning of photojournalism, and remains an accurate but depressing look into the lives of poor New Yorkers in the early part of the 20th century.This book never fails to amaze me. I read it in college, then ordered it for someone else recently.If you have never read it - or, if you have not read it recently, give it a look.In these times when the rich are increasingly wealthier than they've been since the 19th Century - the middle class is shrinking - and the poor are becoming poorer, it is wise to look and remember how socially aware and socially responsible we must be."
2,Feel cheated!,"I feel duped and cheated! When I opened the MAXTOR box, I found a slip of paper that says ""IMPORTANT NEWS. Quantum HDD has merged with Maxtor Corp. The drive included in this kit meet Mastor's rigorus quality standards. The MaxDiag utility that came with this kit will NOT work properly with Quantum models, etc, etc."". How am I supposed to diagnose problems WITHOUT it!SO, I didn't purchase a Maxtor hard drive like as advertised!! I will probably NOT buy anything from Amazon OR Maxtor again! Again, I feel cheated and am VERY angry about this!!"
1,A Boring Movie,"This movie could have been so much more, they really missed it here. I bought it because I want to see every film that Kris Holden-Ried has acted in but if you have no reason to purchase this film don't."
5,THE BEST THEY COULD DO...,"I guess under the circumstances, in terms of Jimi's estate/liscensing, etc. the producer, director and actors did the best the could with what they had access too. I thought that Wood Harris' interpretation was wonderful. He brought out Jimi's sweet nature as well as his sexually free spirit. I would recommend this movie to those who don't know about Jimi. The supporting cast did a great job, especially Billy Zane and Viveca A. Fox."
1,SOMEONE PLEASE KILL ME!!!!!!!!!!,"My God I'm depressed!!!!!!!! I just rented this ""movie"". (I use that term lightly) Not one redeeming quality. I wanted to turn it off about ten times while watching but, like a train wreck, I couldn't look away. Wood has Jimi's moves down, but that's about it. He made him seem like kind of a [dolt]. Bad acting, bad production, bad British accents, bad bad bad bad bad!!!!! I pray they make a real film along these lines in the future. I could have done better than this."
4,"rude, crude, and righteously reasonable...","Rude, crude, and sometimes lewd... yet consistently hilarious and righteously reasonable. Never before have sacred cows such as gun control, the Endangered Species Act, and, yes, even circumcision been slaughtered so gleefully. Prepare to be offended, provoked, and/or enlightened."
3,Great product but way too fragile,"I really like this product, (I use it with my Siemens 2402 base station). The only complaint about its features is that the menu system is needlessly complex (that actually doesn't bother me too much, but may be a big deal to others). However, the phone is extremely fragile. I've had two of them fail in different ways after just 1.5 years of service. One of them has had a keypad go bad, the other has developed a horrible distortion problem (I know it's the phone since the other handsets in the house don't have that problem)."
1,Never will buy a Siemens again,"I bought the 2-line Siemens 2420 system with 1 handset. I bought two additional refurbished handsets. After 4 months both of them died. To protect my investment I tried buying a new handset and found out nobody carries new handsets anymore, and few places they wanted $ for each.I am not very pleased with quality of the phones and the phone system. Every 45 days the phone system locks-up and I have to reset the stystem and set it up again (I am becoming expert in that!!).This would be my last purchase of any Siemens system. They even don't want to repair their own system."
2,not for heavy use,"I use my phone a lot. This one has reasonable features, but navigation (especially the redial facility) is cumbersome and irritating (taking 3 key presses).In addition you have to dial slowly or the phone misses some key presses.Finally the keypad is getting worn out (I've had it for a year).Not impressed."
2,Cellular quality in a digital phone,"This phone came highly recommended by telecom people in my company. However, the 2402 has yet to live up to the hype. I really enjoy the range on the phone. But whether I am next to the base unit or 2 doors down, the call quality is lousy. I am asked 4 out of 5 calls if I am on a cell phone. The cutting out is extremely noticeable. I can't believe the amount of money I spent for the quality I received. I'm sticking with my corded analog until I find something else and can afford it."
4,"Outstanding, except for the batteries.","I bought one to go with my base. It is sleek, light weight, and the security features are excellent. The intercom, and call forwarding to individual handsets, are features I most liked about the system. The built-in spare battery charger is nice too. This system has better sound than the two 900MHz SONY units that it replaces. The only drawback was that the batteries that came with it would not charge, even after 24 hours. I bought NiMH batteries to replace them, they have twice the capacity of NiCads."
5,Wonderful music the way it should be,The Crowes combine the best of the Faces and the Stones to continue their musical journey into the new millenium. This CD captures their raw energy and wonderful musical virtuousity. Rock On!
2,Pricing issues?,"Why is this book so much more expensive than the rest of the series? I thought Kindle books were supposed to be cheaper than the hard copy of the same? I could easily get a used copy for just $1, or spend a whopping $13 on the Kindle edition? C'mon Amazon, lets get a bit more friendly towards your Kindle users."
1,Definite Let Down,This book was tedious and unoriginal. It felt like Mr. King chose to slap together this book in response to the reader demand. I think he may have lost his vision for this series that I have been greatly anticipating. I was very disappointed Mr. King.
1,The Dark Tower series went from classic to rubbish in this entry.,"I love the first four books in this series, but when this crappy follow-up came out, I found that it sucks hard. The story is stupid and the writing is lame. Its garbage. Ignore this rubbish and stick with Dark Tower Novels 1-4."
3,decent but not up to par,"Stephen King's Dark Tower series carries some of the best fantasy type fiction in print, but that only goes for books one through four. Wolves of the Calla was a decent book, but no where near as good as the former books. Also, the main concept of this book was taken from Akira Kurosawa's The Seven Samurai, and thus not really original. Still, this is probably the last good book in the Dark Tower series."
1,"Here's The Deal, Folks","Here's whats happening with the DT books.Kingobviously has a 5 book story and is telling it in a 7 book series. Its like making meatloaf for 20 people with 4 pounds of beef. Your going to have to use a LOT of filler to get enough meatloaf. Book number 5 is filler. I'm sure the last book in the series will be wonderful, King just thought he had more story than he actually does. And whatswith the awful artwork? Somebody had to approve this stuff for the book, I can't believe they looked at it and said ""Hey! Great stuff!"" It belongs in a bad comic book.My general review of Wolves: Hey, they can't all be gems..."
5,A must read,"The whole series is a must read but this book, in particular, is outstanding and an universe in its own. Leaves an imprint in your mind not many books do."
3,Disappointing,"In my opinion, I think this book was probably the worst one since the first book. There was a bit too much buildup to the Wolves coming. And when they came, it was a bit anti-climatic, being too short and seemingly a bit too easy for me. I also figured out what the Wolves were way before the ending. Callahan coming in was brilliant, since I myself have always wondered where the heck he went at the end of ""Salem's Lot."" But there was way too much palavering, too much of Callahan's back story.The good parts? The rest of the ka-tet becoming true gunslingers, especially Jake. Stories of the Calla residents and the traveling were also good.I will definitely will be continuing on the series, but hopefully the rest wouldn't be so unnecessarily long."
3,A sort of in-between book,"This books stands apart from the rest of the Dark Tower series in that it pretty much all takes place in the same place. It reminded me of a quintessential Western story where the gunslingers roll into a troubled town and agree to help the poor townsfolk from the imminent arrival of the outlaw band of miscreants who plunder and pillage. Only these outlaws, the wolves, don't steal your money or your horses, they steal your children. Even though the book was less epic than others, I still found it engaging. And there are some mystical twists that keep it from being completely mundane. By now, though, there's a sense that Roland and his ka-tet of gunslingers are unbeatable, so there's not too much suspence. Jake is awesome though; I love it when kids get more credit than they usually do in the real world. Ultimately, though, the book does feel like an in-between pit-stop interrupting Roland's quest for the Tower."
3,A trip to the Calla...,"This book is what I see as a love-it or hate-it kinda book. I personally enjoyed it, but it did seem to drag. The first 4 books I flew through, and this one definitely took some personal initiative to sit down and read. Although it isn't a bad read, it's more of the Gunslinger and his Ka-tet and more hitches along the dark tower. And it sets up book 6 with some really great tie-ins to their quest for the tower. You will start to see things really become serious about that quest, and will be wholesomely ready for book 6. And whether you loved the book or not, if you have enjoyed the series so far you will enjoy most of this one, and be eager for the next."
5,book,Book arrived quickly and in excellent condition! I am very pleased with my purchasing experience.
2,It should have stopped at wizard and glass...,"I was suspecting that the series was going south at the end of the 4th book.Wolves just shows that King got lost in the middle earth and is just trying to pull resources from ANYWHERE, his own work or any other work, and he is doing it not from ""literary genius"" but just from plain desperation, which is more evident in the next two final books.I do agree with the other comment, he should have stopped after the fourth book and should've avoid giving us the ""Wachowski feeling"" of destroying what might have been a really good and original idea..."
5,A Story Within A Story,"I loved ""Wolves of the Calla,"" as I love the entire Dark Tower series. This book has a fantastic story within itself. It ties into the previous DT books, that goes without saying, but King also introduces character from his other books. Characters who previously were not a part of the DT. This story also introduces new threats to the DT, which we know threatens all of existence.From Mark John SternalAuthor of ""GUITAR: Total Scales Techniques and Applications""""GUITAR: Probable Chords""""Complete Guitar By Ear"""
5,cute~ but sad ending book,"This book is very cute and has notes and thought from the ships' crew on the polar bound expedetion. The photographs were quite good and it was interesting the dynamics of the whole ship and the crew.The ending is very sad though, they have to abandon the ship and trek across the ice so Shackleton orders several of the sled dogs pup and the cat shot and killed. (she could have rode in the sled.) Harry McNish felt the loss of the cat most profoundly and he was wrote up for discipline problems later. When he died they place a bronze cat on his grave in honor of Mrs. Chippy."

3,"It's not a Maxtor HD, its a Quantum HD","Its hard to review a HD, but I just want to say that this is not a Maxtor Hard drive. This is a Quantum Hard Drive, the box, the instructions everything its from Maxtor, except the Hard drive. Now I know that they merged, but in the product description it should be shown."
