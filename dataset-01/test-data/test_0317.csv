5,great for boys,my nephews loved this for sure. use it in their mud room to reach their coats and what not. :)
2,Ok book.,"To be honest, i really could not get into the book. the story started out slow and i lost interest fast."
1,One star more then it is worth,"Recieved one of these as part of a kit. My canon 20d didn't even see a flash attached [430ex and 580exII] My 5d was able to fire the flashes but only in manual mode. Both worked perfectly when mounted directly to the camera, and when I went out and bought the Canon product they worked with it. I'm not sure what camera it works with, but obviously not these. Also very flimsy build, I was scared it would break off when the 580, which is heavy, was mounted. E-mailed Adorama twice, asking for a working replacement, with no reply, finally sent it back. I did get a refund from the company but no reply ever to my inqueries. THe e-mail anouncing the refund said ""please e-mail us if we can help you in the future"" - too bad they don't seem to be able to do that."
4,Saint Agnes and the Burning Train...,"This CD is an extension of the common Elizabethan thread that Sting has had throughout much of his work, from naming Ten Summoners Tales after the Canterbury Tales, in songs like 'Saint Agnes and the Burning Train' from The Soul Cages, as well as the B-Side 'Lullaby to an Anxious Child' which Sting wrote for his daughter. It is intelligent and intimate and relaxing, with Sting's voice in pure form with only an acoustic accompaniment. The spoken intros are soft and minimal and dont take away from the CD as a whole."
1,This disc makes you semper dolens - in a bad way.,"This is simply a disaster. The lutenist is OK. The so-called ""singer"" is flat, as someone else pointed out, and has no feeling at all for the artificial expressiveness of this music - nay, he has no voice to speak of in the first place. It may be the worst classical music CD of all time, if you exclude those which were quite amusing in their way. Now David Bowie doing ""Flow my tears"" might be quite fun - but this...Nada."
4,Attention Sting Fans,"If you are a die hard Sting fan, you'll love this. If you adore Sting, the vocals will make you melt ......"
1,a shame,"Sting (of whom I think very well as a musician in his own terms) has given a step into the early baroque-lute-song reperoire of great composer John Dowland... Too bad for him. There are plenty of better choices (almost everyone that exists) for this music... I belive most of the people who will buy and listen this CD do not have any idea of how this music must be sung., and most of them must be fans of the singer... Well, good for them because they will have the opportunity to hear a great composer and some of the most touching music per voice and lute... but ror the rest of us... this cd is just a fiasco."
2,for Sting fans only,"If you're one who enjoys the toneless rasp that is Sting's voice, you'll love this recording. For the rest of us, the miscast Sting spoils an otherwise praiseworthy performance of Dowland's excellent songs. Edin Karamazov on lute is masterly charm overshadowed, alas, by Sting. The recitation of Dowland's letters detracts from the music too and should have been in the liner notes, where the letters couldn't be so affected as they are on the audio tracks."
1,Disappointing,"I love Sting, and I guess I must have been expecting something else. I have to say I was a little disappointed in this effort. On the one hand, it is artistic and creative, and I think it's great not to focus always on commercial appeal, but this was so beyond what Sting has done in the past, it almost needed a disclaimer that it is a huge departure from previous releases."
1,Don't bother--you can have my copy.,"I am a Sting fan from way back, and I always appreciate his willingness to try new things. I am also a classical music afficionado, however, and this CD was a complete disappointment. Not only has his shimmering tenor of yesteryear vanished entirely from misuse, but his voice is just not well suited to this material. Given that he is not trained in this genre, he doesn't have the foggiest idea how to interpret this beautiful, subtle and finely nuanced repertoire. I found it not only amateurish, but basically unlistenable. So let me give you a clue on this one--don't bother, you can have my copy."
5,Is there music Sting can't do?!,"I love this cd! I purchased it shortly after I saw Sting do an interview on a morning show and he discussed the new cd. I'm a fan of all types of music, but this is a great cd to play while snuggled up on the couch with the fireplace roaring and a hot cup of tea. It's very relaxing and Sting's voice is just amazing. He never ceases to amaze me with his musicianship. A true master!"
1,Not what I expected from Sting,"I got this as a gift for my Husband, but after we both listened to it we were very dissapointed."
1,If I could give it no stars i would,Bought this CD without knowing that Sting turned into a minstrel. What a horrible piece of JUNK !!!! I wish I could return it.
4,Biker's rock!,This game is really cool cuz you can be the slimjim dude. The tricks are really fun and easy except for the beef spicey. I like to ride around Camp Woodward. I think this should be on your list of must-haves.
3,"Fun but,Challenges,Controls,AAAHHHHHHHH!!!","This game deserves 3 stars cause of the following reasons.1.Controls drive you insane.I have Bloody Roar PF.It's a button masher's dream,but Dave Mirra 2 is insane!2.The challenges are extremely difficult(Hardcore only.I rented the game,and never got to the insane mode).3.It is fun, but I hope Dave Mirra 3 is better than this Rehash!"
2,not satisfied,Description lies that degrees could be switched from F to C. This is not true!!!. Very unsatisfied!!!
3,Stealing Jesus,"After a wonderful start Mr Bawer began to paint with too broad a brush and wound up making many of the same mistakes he resents in others. I hope his subsequent work will give us some insight into issues he brought up, but addressed only superficially in his closing chapter. For example, what about the real impact of real evil in the real world? What answer can the Churches of Love give? I believe they have THE answer but Bawer does not develop it. On balance, though, I have to say that this book is an essential read for anyone who cares about the manifestation of Faith in America today."
4,An excellent history of American fundamentalism,"Bawer gives one of the best descriptions of the roots and development of American Christian fundamentalism that I have ever seen. His history is accurate, concise, and erudite. He has some thoughtful comments on his own faith and presents himself--like all of us who are Christians--as struggling to know and love God and to do what God wants. He does wander off the path more than once and does engage now and then in the same kind of bashing for which he criticizes legalistic Christians. I am as fascinated with the many comments on this book as I am with the book itself. What an interesting collection of opinions--many of which I'm sure the author could have predicted. I think he would be pleased that so many have taken the time to read his work. I recommend it."
3,Very Good writing; Lack of citations,"The value of the book's content is expounded on numerous times in other posts; however, my biggest problem with the book is there are absolutely no endnotes or footnotes. While I recognize this book is popularly written, it contains numerous quotations and interesting facts but NONE of them are cited. The back of the book contains a ""Bibliography"" that says ""here follows a highly selective list of resources that are available for general readership..."" The utter lacking of citation really hurt my impression of a very well written book. In the end, good book, but don't count on double-checking anything very easily."
2,Interesting Critique of Fundamentalism,"It's rare to read a critique of fundamentalism from someone who actually understands its origins. Bawer understands it well, from Scofield to Lindsey to Robertson."
1,Misses the mark,"Yes, the bottom line of the Gospel is love. But, one cannot pick and choose what part of the Gospel message to believe. If Jesus didn't die on that cross to pay the price for our sins, none of it means anything. It was hardly just a nice example of ""selflessness."" Be careful of this book. It is full of false doctrine, written by someone who wants to interpret the Bible to justify his own lifestyle. Granted, Christianity is not something to be shoved down someone's throat. But it also is not the Gospel According to Bruce."
2,Bawer misses the mark,"A trusted minister friend of mine recommended this book as insightful reading material into the success of fundamentalist groups. Bawer's distinction between law and love is interesting and in my experience fairly accurate. However, his constant attacks on all religious groups except for Anglicans proved to be distracting. Perhaps his book should more aptly be entitled: Cafeteria Christians: How religious groups betray Jesus by perverting his words to fit theological constructs."
2,This game sucks,"This game is a terrible excuse for a GameCube game. The graffics are just a bit better than PS One.There are so many glitches with it also. The announcers continually say the wrong player names, and sometimes say the team names wrong.The gameplay is also very below par. You can score on every play using the hail mary with a fast receiver. When players don't catch the ball, the ball bounces off of them like it was flubber.Get Madden 2002 instead. It looks better, has a franchise mode, has a better create a player option, and is overall a lot funner (which is what really matters)."
1,horiible game!,I hated this game evrything u can possibly imagine bad in a football game it has. A horrible game do not buy!
1,RATED PG13 +!!!,"Ugh, I am twelve years old and have read many, many books. The story of this book is kind of crappy, and easily predicted. 5 star book? FAT CHANCE. Some of this book was a little innapropriate, and many of the people at my school agree. Some referances were a little adult, and some of the scenes were not very pretty to picture, no offence. The climax was, iffy, and I'm still not quite sure what is was anyway. If the author decides to write another book, take it up a notch ok?"
5,"Finally, a book worth reading","As a teenager, I have read numerous books about the same subject. While you read them, they all blend into one another and end the same way, and have no surpises in the plot at all. When I picked up a copy of Mr. Meyer's book, I thought the same about it while i read the summary. To my surprise i was enchanted while reading the first pages. Not only is the story rich with wonderful characters and dialogue, it is filled with sea-faring adventure, romance and humor. I have been told that teenage boys do not appreciate this story, but I am a male, and it is now one of my favorites.If books were money, this one would be gold. Mr. Meyer, I applaud you."
3,History and Eastern Philosophy,"The book is very informative, for those with good eyesight. The print is smaller than normal, so for those of us who have difficulty seeing small print, it is a chore to read.But when looking for information on a particular herb, or when searching for a remedy for a particular ailment, this book has excellent information.However, you also need to wade through the history of the herb, how it has been used in the past, and the Eastern philosophy surrounding it.If I had wanted a book on the history of herbs or the philosophies surrounding them, I would have bought a book with that in mind. What I wanted was a book that gave me more how-to and less verbiage.It is well-written, though. So if you want a book that also includes history and philosophy, then this is the book for you. It also has great pictures and excellent guides."
2,Disappointing,"I've seen about 5 Harry Carey B westerns from the 1930s and all were entertaining. ""Border Devils"" is unfortunately one of the worst B westerns I ever saw. The pacing is terrible and the supporting players (except George Hayes) are awful in their deliveries. Even Harry Carey (one of my favorites) delivers his lines unconvincingly. The script is muddled as well. The scenery is terrific and this would probably have been a good silent western, as you wouldn't actually hear the static delivery of the cast. The director must have been dozing. I've given my copy away. Luckily it has been my experience that, in buying dvds of movies I've not seen before, such disappointment is a rare occurence. I've given this film 2 stars for the scenery, a decent print, and George Hayes."
2,Maybe better than nothing?,"The ""Method girls"" are cute, but you can't really see anything useful in many of the pictures. Good drawings would be more clear, but would apparently have been too big an investment for this pretty but mostly useless book. Many idiosyncratic ideas and jargon, but I found it really hard to learn any new techniques from this. And some, like the self-launch technique, did not work properly with my kite. There are much better ones."
3,Kiteboarding Book,"This is a very good book if you are beginner. Anything you can read on the sport to help you become more knowlegable on the sport and become a safe kiter, you should read."
5,New Views of Hindu Goddesses,"I was pleasantly surprised to find a book on goddesses that covers Hindu as well as the usual Egyptian and Greek. Trobe does not treat them as mythological characters but as living entities that can be contacted and interacted with. This is true of all the goddesses she covers (fifteen in all), whether they are currently worshipped or not. All Trobe's descriptions were colorful and easy to visualize, and include some intense exercises like contacting Kali to help stop cycles of abuse. Religion can sometimes be sterile, but reading Kala Trobe's book makes the goddesses come alive."
5,Hole Saw,"Saw was only used to cut 4 holes in 1/2"" plywood. I used a battery powered drill and was able to drill the holes just fine. It's a bit much for a battery operated drill, however it worked just fine with some patience. Do not let your drill excessively overheat.I can't really comment too much on the extended use on this, but it got the job done just fine and appears to be a good quality saw."
2,Fun fluffy portrayal of Strauss Story,"This is not ageless cinema. It's dated, but it's fun. The scene where Strauss composes the Vienna Woods Waltz is one of the best in the picture (I'm giving no details away). The history is flawed, but the rags to riches story is definitely a fun thing to watch on rainy afternoons. Music is wonderful...of course!"
3,Schmaltz Fest,"Unfortunately, this 30's schmaltz-fest seems pretty dated by now. I guess the Depression-era audiences needed some fluffto forget their troubles, but it just hasn't aged well. Musicis still great, Korjus the real gem-beats McDonald any day-butgood for schmaltz-festers to wallow in and listen to good tunes."
5,My oldest daughters favorite game,We bought this for our oldest daughter and she just loves it all over again. I don't remember what happened to the original but this was a great find.
5,Best Futuristic Racing Game Ever,"This game is pure greatness.There are 12 racers, 10 tracks, 12 weapons, and you can go faster than the speed of sound. This is one of my favorite racing games, and if you try it it will probably be yours too."
1,I really did try..,"But I thought this novel was amazingly boring. I was looking for a good read and was grossly dissapointed. It is all narrative - there is next to no dialog and Hall covers the same issues/topics over and over again. I tried on numerous occasions to read this one, and after seeing all the reviews I may even try agin, but so far as the first quarter of the book goes I have to say I dont see the attraction - endless narration on the same topic and limited characters."
3,"Just ""ok""",The Electric Michaelangelo was just ok....I thought that it would have been a lot more interesting than it was...the beginning was slowand I really dont think that it got good until the very end...
3,"Good, but you might as well buy Crazy Taxi 2 for Dreamcast","This is a great game. However, Crazy Taxi 2, available on Dreamcast for a price...cheaper than Crazy Taxi 1 on GameCube. Its in NYC, and has fixed all the faults of the original version."
4,Does the job,"I used this hole saw to cut speaker holes in my aluminum boat. Worked great, clean cut, and fast. Sure was a lot easier then using a jig saw."
4,Early Horror Fiction,"Okay, so it's not quite Stephen King. Still, these stories are actually pretty scary. They are presented as if a group of people were telling ghost stories late in the evening. Some of them deal with the guillotine; one of these features a great use of irony, even if it is a bit predictable. All of the stories are masterfully macabre, and I found that they became increasingly more compelling as I continued to read them."
1,very low quality in the product I got,the product I ordered had more than 20 pages gone. They were torn away apparently before I got the book.
4,Does what it is intended for,Has been a good product to use. Many hours of use. Only drawback has been certain times there is alot of static from the engine and the car is a 2006. Also [and this might be because I don't have a good frequency chossen] the music sounds like a fading radio station. Still very happy with it for the price and my general use.
4,Tear It Down,I thought this was a really good CD but they're much better live. I particularly liked Wearily (I always thought he was saying Warily) and Tear It Down. They're a local Boston band but they've been getting some national airplay too.
1,Beware-you get the European Cord,"Although the item is titled VAR-L40U which is the US version with a standard US plug--you get the VAR-L40 which has the European version plug--useless in the USA. The manufacturer puts a sticker on the box which says VAR-L40U but it is really the European plug. I tried 2 times to purchase the item with the same negative result. Don't blame Amazon, it's the manufacturer. I tried another vendor and wound up with the same issue. After many calls to Sanyo, I finally found someone who can send me the US cord--I hope it works with the base. To be continued."
2,A dissapointing direction for EBTG.,"It's a shame Tracey Thorn's lovely voice is wasted on these synth laden, drum machine heavy, disco arrangements. It's like using Monet to draw up industrial blueprints. I listen and try to imagine what the last two albums would sound like with real instruments, no samples and no hip-hop beat. Guess we'll have to wait for ""Acoustic II."" In the meantime, turn up your bass and get stupid."
4,This album lived up to all my standards.,"And I still listen to it more than 6 months after buying it. I didn't really dig EBTG before their Amplified Heart album, but I can definitely say that like other bands that experiment with their abilities and break into new territory, EBTG is keeping their fans on their toes. Ben has grown in his mixing abilities but still keeps it simple and not too spacey. This is danceable and in-the-car-listenable. It's also for singing along- the lyrics are very much EBTG, and Tracy still croons about Love, loss, and growing older if not wiser. Her voice is unbelievably cool, calm, and diva-ish without getting into the cheerleader qualities of Mariah and the drivel of Celine. This cd is for fans who like to combine club music with a good old fashioned song and a lovely voice."
1,Dreadful!,"Unfortunately, EBTG continues to abandon their fans who have sustained them since the early 80s with yet another album of synthesiser doodlings. It's hard to think of any other musical act who has been so rough on their core audience."
1,EVERYTHING BUT THE ......MUSIC!,"EBTG have proven to the public that they have sold out...ever since they found a niche with ""Missing"", everything else has come out like a copy of this song...Case in point- ""Walking Wounded"", ""Wrong"" and now ""Five Fathoms"".....This CD is dance beat hell....I never thought a dance album could put me to sleep like this one.EBTG go back to your roots - say 8 to 10 albums ago.....I miss Traceys voice!"
4,"Nice, but expensive!","Nice lens hood but, expensive!Thin light plastic with a flock interior which is superior to flat black paint but, at $55 its very expensive.Also, makes a long lens even longer as will any hood on the 70-300mm lens.Another point to make is I don't often use the hood as I don't notice any difference with or without the hood. I have only used the 70-300mm lens a couple of times and saw no flares in the pictures without the hood. Nice flare control built into the lens!Conclusion: Probably a better hood than those cheap ones. Fits the lens perfectly."
2,"Good design, bad materials","I was deeply dissapointed in this lens hood. Given that the cost is about 10% of the cost of the lens for which it was intended (the 70-300 IS in this case) I expected it to be of stiff durable polycarbonate.-Positives-fulfills the basic function of a lens hood- prevents flare, etc.The bayonet locking system is excellent, much easier to deal with than scew-on type lens hoods.that's about it.-Negatives-The polycarbonate is so thin I half expect it to be translucent.The hood must be gripped by the base to remove it, as grippng the thin end of the hood may break it; or at least it feels like it may break it.Its very long. Especially on the 70-300 which is already a long lens, this makes a fully extended zoom about a foot long. That's pretty conspicuous.It's very overpriced vs. generic lenses ($50 vs. $5-10 for rubber or metal).I traded it in and went with a kalt rubber lens hood. 2 stars for the great bayonet design, but the rest of it is weak."
1,Dead on Arrival--Bad Display,"The clock arrived with its ""second time zone"" LCD elements non-functioning and a cross-wiring of its time/date controls, making it impossibe to set the date. Seems like a nice design, but obviously there is no quality control QC prior to shipment. Bulova--another classic brand gone bad."
3,It's fun AND boring!,"the first level was easy, until i got to the second one! the battle was super hard without any rings! i'd liked it alot if i could get to the next level!"
2,SONIC'S FINAL G.B.A.,"SONIC'S FINAL GAMEBOY APPEARENCE IS SONIC GENESIS 06 EDITION.I WAS HIGHLY DISSAPOINTED.ALL THE GAME IS SONIC GENESIS ON GAMEBOY!THE ONLY DIFFERENCE IS THAT YOU CAN USE THE SPIN DASH.IF THEY WERE SMART THEY WOULD HAVE ADDED THE HOMING ATTACK AS WELL,AND PUT IN THE CURRENT MAIN CHARACTERS(TAILS,KNUCKLES,AMY,CREAM,SHADOW,ROUGE,SILVER,BLAZE,METAL SONIC,AND THE CHAOTIX)AS SECRET CHARACTERS.ALL WITH THE SAME ATTACKS THOUGH.EGGMAN WHOULD HAVE STAYED THE VILLIAN."
3,Untitled,"A bit of a disappointment. With the exception of ""Goin Against Your Mind"", the first half of the album feels uninspired. The second half picks up the pace. This CD suffers from a lack of production dynamics. There was some great material going to tape, but it was poorly mixed. It's muddy and the performances are not brought to life. Not sure why they didn't work with Phil Ek, but it was a mistake in my opinion. Like I said though, there is some really good material here."
1,Disappointing,"I have been listening to BTS since 1998, have all their albums (most have been bought with much anticipation only to prove to let down) and have seen their shows multiple times. I have to say that everything post-Keep It Like A Secret has been a let down. Perfect from Now On is amazing in its range, layers, change of tempo, melody, musicianship, lyrics, etc... and this new album is lame in comparison. There is no question why Goin Against Your Mind was pre-released... it is the only song on the album that has any kind of substance to it. It hurts to say that, but it's quite true. Like most every act out there, success has brought about latent half-assedness. Don't buy into the media hype!I could say that this will be the last BTS album that I buy but I think it is safe to say it will be the last anyone will buy (with new material)."
3,I know we're getting older . . .,"but this one isn't all that any of the previous albums are. It's good, solid rock with typical Built to Spill lyrics. Could be better, could be worse, but certainly not pioneering new ground. But are you really looking for that from BtS still?"
3,not great,"Full of facts, the author lists situations and interchanges that are illogical. He is very systematic and easy to follow, but lacks depth. I would have liked to see more anecdotal examples of the fallacies presented. I would probably not recommend this book to someone dealing with specific situations that require a better understanding of fallacy and illogical argument. I would recommend it for a general overview of the subject."
5,Much more than 5 stars!,"The Best of Controlled Bleeding is an outstanding CD! The first disc is full of the harshest music - you feel like you've just been peeled, salted and spanked with a spiked board by the time it's over. I love it! Conversely, the second disc heals the wounds the first disc inflicted with it's slow, goth, often uplifting music. Excellent through and through!"
5,this band is the best!,"I love this CD! It really rocks. Its very unlike most other bands that sound the same. All the songs are really great, like ""Let's All Go!"" and ""She's Gonna See Me Later"". Even their versions of ""Walkin'After Midnite"" and ""Ring of Fire"" make my energy level rise!"
2,Crapped out after 4 years,"Was a great product until it crapped out after 4 years of use. There were a few times where it wouldn't receive a signal from the transmitter, but it would eventually pick up the signal after a few hours."
4,Decent mini-reef but not for new folks...,"Nano Cube, like the Cube Master and other similar all-in-one small environments are generally a good and inexpensive solution for a mini-reef/marine/fresh habitat. With that being said, there is one issue that potential buyers should consider before buying these types of tanks:The size and configuration allow a water quality problem to worsen very quickly.For the sake of what you'll be putting in the tank, please know ahead of time how to cycle a tank, have a reverse osmosis filter or access to RO water, and don't neglect learning to use the requisite test kit which you should have purchased for twice weekly, if not daily, monitoring. If you have any questions, there is a thriving mini-reef/fresh cube community which is a great place to get tips, learn from others mistakes, and look through the various modifications made to these systems by hobbiest's which lead to amazing results (i.e. converting filtration, herb habitats, etc)."
2,More difficult than you think,"I have plenty of experience with freshwater and when I decided to make the jump to saltwater, this seemed like an ideal practice aquarium, I was wrong. First off it is very unwieldy and water just doesn't really like to go inside it or once there, come out. The filter is strong (when it actually works at all) for a tank that size and so is the lighting. I have had it for 4 months and I still can't put any fish in it because of the massive algae infestation that I had to get under control due to the excessivly strong lighting. 2 months later with the help of a lot of snails and hermit crabs the algae is now gone, but the filter has just died on me and is going to be a nightmare to replace. I'm sure that it will work great if I can get it to work properly, but I am really starting to wish that I just went with a traditional aquarium setup."
3,Good but antiquated.,"This book does have the advantage of being terse, well-written, and very good problems. You could learn field theory very quickly.However, it has the severe disadvantage of using antiquated terminology and notation that make it confusing if not detrimental to learning modern commutative ring theory."
5,Works well even on sensitive stomachs....,"This is a good cleanser you can take and still be active without having the ""I got to go"" feeling."
5,A great singer combined with the best songs,"Chris Cagle is going to be a very famous star. He definitely has the voice to be one of the best. ""Laredo"" is a great song as well as ""My Love Goes On and On"". My personal favorites are ""The Safe Side"",""Play it Loud"", ""Who Needs the Whiskey"", ""Lovin' You, Lovin' Me"" and ""I Breathe, I Breathe Out"". As you can see, there are so many that are great that its hard to pick favoites. He has a lot of talent and will be very big someday. I definitely suggest that everyone gets this cd."
1,NOT ALL FOR VERIZON!,I just bought the router from AMAZON and it is not for verizon. The one I got is for BELL SOUTH and does not work on verizon. Check the moddel #s before you buy!
3,Good Overview of a Great Wrestler,"This is a better-than-expected kids book; especially considering Monsoon's heyday was over 40 years ago. It has a lot of good photos, covers the highlights of Monsoon's life in wrestling, and even taught me 1 or 2 things; like how Monsoon thrashed the legendary Antonino Rocca in 3 minutes. But its priced too high, and shortshrifts Monsoon's time as a fan-favorite. Gorilla had good matches left in him around 1969 on, beating Killer Kowalski, George Steele, Professor Tanaka and Lou Albano, among others."
5,lets review the album!,"Unfortunately the only review at this time is of a secondary seller and not of the album itself. Not helpful!I love this album. It's among my favorites and I have several nature albums (gets me through the winter months!). I wish the tracks were longer, my only complaint. There isn't any accompanying music which is something I specifically look for in nature sound albums. So don't be afraid to give it a try. There are samples available on a popular music site if you want previews."
2,Great for the coffee table.,I thought that this book was going to be a little more in depth about the workouts that the Champs did in this book. Instead it gave a very brief discussion of what they did. I didn't pay much for this book so i am not too disappointed. Now i just sits on my coffee table for my guests to have a quick read.
1,Boring,"This is not at all what might be expected. The book is filled with pictures, the same 10 or so interview questions and a list of workout routines that vary, slightly, with each athlete. There is no rationale included in the benefits or strategy of each boxer's workout or routine. There is very little here that would be of use or interest to anyone interested in learning."
4,digdave,"light weight, great if you already have a camera around your neck.Great for spotting birds you want to take pictures of."
1,Not a pair of goals,"When I ordered this product, the title was ""PUGG Goal - The 4 Footer (PR)"" and the last sentence of the product description read, ""Each pair includes storage bag and anchoring pegs.""So, from the product title and product description, I thought I was getting a pair of goals, but I only got 1 goal. Since then, it appears they have removed the (PR) after the product title but the product description still states that, ""Each pair includes storage bag and anchoring pegs.""I was able to return the item and get a refund after several calls to Fogdog over about a 1-month period."
1,"Junk, should have been 99, its the cheapest scraper I've ever seen.",This scraper is super cheap and flimsy. The price should be 99 cents and you'd still be getting a bad deal. Keep looking or suffer the consequences that I did. Embarrassment about your floppy scraper.
4,Fun Roots Americana Collection of Train Songs,"It's exactly as you think this might be - a collection of songs about trains - most with train effects or drums subbing for trains rolling down the tracks ... so if that's what you want - it's a fun collection of roots Americana, country, country/western and alt country songs about trains. The quality is pretty consistent, all fun & top notch tracks (no pun intended :-)"
5,Just what I wanted!,"Have been looking at this watch for a while now. Finally ordered and received my first one, for some reason it did not keep time. I was disappointed of course, because I love the look of the watch. Followed the return instructions, so easy, and had an new one within the week, it works great and I am very happy. This watch for the price is a great deal and looks great on my arm. It is great for everyday wear or dressing up. Very pleased now."
4,Not water resistant in shower,"Bought this for my wife. She really likes the look of it. I used water resistant to 30ft as a search criteria on Amazon so expected it to be fine for wear in the shower. It says on the watch that it is water resistant to 3 atm, but the manual says this means only for splashing when washing hands. Disappointed today to see the face all fogged up because my wife didn't take it off for the shower. Otherwise seems solid and good looking."
1,Clasp Defective,"Unfortunately, the clasp would not stay secure and an hour after putting it on, the watch would fall to the floor or fly across the room. I had to return it."
2,Lacks cohesiveness,Too Many numbers for too many occasions! Not a very comprehensive account. I really regret having not selected a different author on this topic.
2,I don't get it,"Loved ""Big Fish"" but have no idea what this book has to offer. I feel like I'm reading the story of anyone's run-of-the-mill life. I really wanted to like it too, but no matter how I tried, I just felt like it was either over my head or just plain boring."
3,Feet of clay?,"Growing up we were given Thomas Edison as modelof what a good American could be and do.Just lately I saw the biography of Nicola Teslawho was a younger foreign born inventor who invented the use of alternating current technology for lighting and electric motors.His treatment by the older Edison was not that of what a role modelshould be?One can't take away Edison's inventions, but it doesn'tmean that we have to say he was a better person than he actually was, does it? Henry Ford was anti-semitic and we still say he was a founder of the auto industry and inventor of the assembly line.Great men don't have to be ""perfect"" to be great men."
4,Building Strength & Endurance for Open Ocean Swimming,"This is the first time I've used hand paddles for open ocean swimming. I originally bought them for bodysurfing for when the surf is up, but I find I like using them more and more just to help build strength and endurance while I swim to keep in shape. I notice what a workout they give me especially toward the end of a session. The sizes are deceptive, however. Small should fit the average size hand. I bought mediums but they were way too big, so then the large size would be for extremely large hands."
1,Advise Against,"It is a good product but very over priced and your buying a brand. The challenge is they don't stand behind the brand. The straps will break (chlorine on rubber). They, unlike Tyr and other paddle companies don't support or sell replacement straps so you are stuck buying another set of paddles. Advise against."
4,this is 5 star material but then greatest hits should be 6,"this isnt tupacs best but dont let me throw u off wit that. this is still better then 99% of the emcees out there makin albums. He mixed poetry to rap made it work then touched us with songs that were positive instead of the normal negative"" Im gonna kill you"" vibe displayed by other hiphop artists. THis album is really dope but then albums like me against the world, greatest hits, all eyez on me and others should be given 6 or 7 stars because they make a mockery of any other hiphop album made( exceptions of born again, ready to die, capital punishment, its dark and hell is hot, eazy duz it, chronic 2001 and others.)But this album is still a must for any one............."
4,Another Great Album by Another Great Rapper,"2pac is by far my favorite rapper and will always be. His music has touched a lot of people and his songs are different to those like Jay-Z, Ludacris, Nelly, P.Diddy etc.Until The End Of Time is a 2 disc set that is full of great songs. Expect guest appearances from R.L, Outlawz, K-Ci and JoJo, SKG and more. Disc 1 starts off with 'Ballad Of A Dead Soulja' which is an excellent song. Songs to look out for are: ""Lil Homies"", ""Letter 2 My Unborn"", ""Breathin"", ""Until The End Of Time"", ""When Thugz Cry"" and ""Thug N U Thug N Me"".Although not as good as 'All Eyez On Me', this 2 disc piece is great. Most of the tunes to the music is great as well as the lyrics...."
1,2Pac\rap artist,"I don't know much about his music. He has a song with some music I like that is on the movie, Soul Food"
4,I Am AL1VE,"This album is equal to any of the previous albums released by PAC. You feel this album especially the poetic Unborn Child, and Letter to my unborn. As far as am aware he didn't have any kids. This shows the depth of his thinking and mental attitude and lyrical writing ability. In until the end of time, he displays a charamatic personality asking himself if he is to blame for his troubles. The emphatic all out track demostrates the various levels this artist is able to reach, while still maintaining the entertainment value. The album is almost like a dairy filled with events that pursued his lifesyle - not many Rap artists can display this type of thought provoking lyrics. Buy it and you will not be disappointed a great album, a good album a sad album, the musical lyrical genius of Tupac is very much ALIVE"
5,Stong and fresh!,Thes batteries were great! A lot cheaper than local stores and the remote car key they power has never functioned as well as it is now.
5,"I assume this product is good, but im not 100% sure",I got this to replace the battery in my key fab for my car. Its a new car and a new fab. You have to be practically inside the car to get it to work. It worked fine for a couple months and then now Idk. but I am assuming its the car and not this battery. But buyer beware..
5,value watch battery,Great value for replacement battery in Timex Ironman watch. Time will tell regarding longevity of battery. 4 yr life of the original ...
5,You need this for a recessed cable plate,"If you are installing a dual gang recessed cable plate for running multimedia cables through your wall, you need this to attach to your sheetrock first. When installing the bracket, take note of the where the holes are for attaching the wall plate. The wall plate will have corresponding holes and screws and you need to makes sure the bracket is positioned correctly so that you can mount the wall plate in the right direction. Also, the bracket is not perfectly square, so if you install it sideways and realize you need to rotate it 90 deg, you may need to do some more trimming of the hole to get it to fit."
1,Needs more support.,"There are only 2 corners that get held to the wall, the other 2 corners stick out. So when the plate is installed it will not set flush to the wall."
2,Check your width dimensions first,"Check the inside (in-wall) width dimensions of whatever you're installing into this bracket first... I tried installing a fully loaded 12-port keystone-jack wallplate, but had no luck. Approximately 1/8-1/4 inch more width is required.Product would've been great if it supported standard dual gang inside dimensions. (Great construction, solid plastics, etc, though)."
4,"If you like learning about the brain, this is a great book.",Very interesting and intriguing book to read. Information on what scientists are learning about the brain and shows the outcome on some brain scans. I know it sounds boring to some but i find it fascinating.
4,Worldly,"This is a very good, thorough book. It explains music of all countries, tying the music together quite well. The music from the listening guides was very helpful in understanding what she was talking about. I just wish I could find the CD's that came with the book.My only complaint is that she did not go into any Classical, rap, pop, or Broadway music. These are very important to world music, and I was surprised to see that she did not include them.All in all, its a great book that has interesting and educational topics."
5,Loads of fun!,The perfect solution to my three kids fighting over the best tube. Now they can all go together!
5,Typical of Hoeg!,"Hoeg has succeeded in writing beautiful prose, powerfully drawn characters, and, as is typical of Hoeg, a brilliant, thought-provoking plot!As an environmentalist and a lover of literature, I strongly recommend this book -- especially for environmental ethics classes."
1,Waste of money$!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"DO NOT DO NOT DO NOT by this product! I just received it last week , who ever sent them to me thought it was a slick move to cover the expired date with a sticker! DO NOT by this product , there cheap for a reason >:/"
4,Very lovely,"I made a very exhaustive investigation before got this product and now is too soon for say if it works. But service is good, shipping fast and in good shape. I have been taking this product for short time but for now i am very happy with it. It seems to be working. Recomendations says you must wait 3 weeks to see some results, but i noticed some diference in the first week. Remember, each body is diferent, and can take you more or less time to achieve desire results. Also, there are certain recomendations you should follow to get best results, use internet."
1,Expired Pills,I bought these pills for my girlfriend because she didnt have a credit card to order them online and when they arrived. It came with a note explaing that the pills are still good 2 years after the expiration date. The pills expired 10/2009 come on now! No wonder they were soooo cheap for a 3 month supply.
5,We are all just travelers in eternity..,"This book is magnificent and a key to expanding your awareness in these times of great change. Unlike nearly all books, this one speaks to the heart of your inner-most being, literally. The information presented is astonishing to say the least and by reading the text you are instantly connected to the consciousness of Mikos, a highly evolved soul here on Earth. Thus, the adventure begins... Prepare to never be the same."
2,Dont Bother With THis One.,"I reviewed GETTING THE WORDS RIGHT and gave it 5 stars. It's an excellent book. This one is mostly bad, punctuated with some good tips. The newer edition may be better as it includes some new thoughts and ideas. But theyre not in this edition. And this is the one youre considering. I have 2 problems with this edition: It's mostly quotes of other writer's stuff, AND Cheney's own writing never quite grabs your attention. I mean, I wanted to pay attention! but my mind kept wandering, and my reading was forced. At the end I had no idea what I had read. But Cheney can be excellent."
3,would work for a home aquarium,"I think this is a good product, but it didn't work for my application. Should work great for a home aquarium."
3,A bit of a yawn-er,"If you are planning to open up a high-end gift shop specializing in handcrafted wind chimes and micro-bakery scone mixes and the like, then you must have this CD playing for your customers. It might have a certain appeal there that it did not find in my living room. Not to say that the musicianship is not utterly outstanding, which it is most certainly. Aside from Short Trip Home, which is why I purchased this CD in the first place, I found the rest of the pieces somewhat vapid considering the caliber of the artists. Again, it has its appeal in an easy listening realm, but this was not what I was looking for."
2,Cute but...,"When I found this and read through the reviews I thought it was the perfect gift to give my nephew when he is born. However, upon recieving it I've changed my mind. I love the fact that the bear is so soft but the eyes on the one I recieved are just horrible. They are sewn on to where it looks like the head should be upside down. I know the eyes should be about even with the nose or around that area but on mine they are uneven and just too low.I was debating keeping it but it's not worth it when it just bothers me to look at it.I'll just have to find another type of Classic Pooh somewhere.I gave it two stars because everything else aside from the way the face looks is perfect :("
5,my new vacuum,"Just picked up the Hoover EmPower to replace a 3 to 4yr-old Hoover that didn't suck anymore. Very easy to unpack and get started up. Hush Mode isn't exactly whisper quiet, but it's excellent for watching football on TV. Love the Power Boost - you can really feel the power in your quivering hand. The cord never tangles.Picked up a lot of dust and dirt on the first pass, with little to none after a second pass around the room - so it cleans great on the first try. Cleans apartment carpeting as well as tiled floors. Does not reach 90 degree corners of the room, but that's what the tools are for.A note about Hush Mode: make certain your red thumb switch is in the middle, or ""unlocked"" position, or else Hush Mode will be bypassed. Also, Hush Mode produces a less powerful suck. The detachable dusting brush is great for upholstery, but use normal power with Power Boost for the tight spots.The EmPower stores well, just wish you could attach the brush to the machine. I'd buy it again."
1,Dead on arrival,"I should have listened to the other reviews. It does not work! As always, you get what you pay for!"
3,Should be more Baby-user friendly,"It's been just 5 days since I bought this book for my nearly 3year old and already have mixed feelings about it. First let me write the positives. My son enjoys it a lot loves the steering wheel, the carousel, the doors which open and shut. My complaint is that the book should be more Baby-user friendly, meaning it should be much better able to withstand a baby's pulls. The area around the tabs which work the escalator and the window are already torn, as is the magazine slot. The carousel is simply too difficult for my baby to turn as is sending the plane in a loop. Do not think this book will last a month under my child's explorations."
5,The best book ever on sailing or building faster boats,"I thought I knew about meteorology, waves, boatbuilding and sailing. I have a first class Cambridge degree in physics, have sailed and raced various boats (dinghies and sailboards) for 30 years and designed one fast dinghy. I thought I was one smart dude. Words begin to fail me. Wow! I wish I had known this lot 30 years ago. It turns out that I was pig ignorant. The book is the best I have ever seen on what the wind does. It's the best ever on how to handle it. It's extremely good on rigs and how to adjust them. It's not just the best ever, it's streets ahead. Don't expect to read it quickly. There is a vast amount to take in. If you really know your stuff you might get through it in a few weeks. Better to plan on a whole winter."
4,Splendid reading for a sailing scientist,"It's a great book, although I don't think it's something for the average sailer. A vast knowledge of science will help you understanding this book much better. The book is devided into four parts, of which I especially found the first two parts, named wind and water, very usefull. Wind is not just the story about high and low pressures, it's also translated to the effects you see on the water and the action that needs to be taken for maximum benefit. The water part is a good explanation about wave paterns and how to sail it. Parts three and four, called The Boat and Handeling, I found less usefull. It's better to buy a book who's specific on your type of yacht than reading a general story about this."
2,"This reads like a textbook, not practical for club sailors","I bought this book along with Rick White's Catamaran Racing for the 90's. Rick's book is easier to read, to-the-point, and full of pointers that can be applied on the water. The higher performance sailing however is like a textbook delving into theories of wind flows, hull design etc that will not add any value to how you should roll-tack, jibe, trim your sails, start racing, etc. I do not want to disregard the value of knowing the advanced topics in this book however for someone who races hobie fx1 on the weekends (for fun), this book literally contains too much information which also makes reading difficult."
2,ADO templates don't work (Ch 15),"This book is fairly decent, except that the template code for ""Connecting to Databases with ADO"" (Chapter 15) is riddled with errors. Most of this is probably due to problems with Access versions and configuration, but in any case, templates that don't work are frustrating and useless. There is absolutely no errata information for this book on the Wiley web site, and Wiley doesn't take inquiries, regardless of the notes in the front of the book. Find a different book for Client/Server study."
4,Very useful addition to equipment,"I do web sites and my newest client is a high-end jewelry store in Coral Gables, FL. I needed pictures of pieces of jewelry, and needless to say, they were not about to leave the shop! This studio-in-a-box is incredibly convenient and very professional in appearance. I was able to get stunning photos of the jewelry with a consistent background. The camera holder is sturdy enough to hold a Nikon D-200 camera with 105 mm VR Macro lens (a heavy combination) very securely. This is a really useful addition to my camera gear at a VERY reasonable price!"
4,Save a picture because there are no instructions,"The price was right. Everything was in good working order. I am an amateur, but I figured out how to set everything up. I was taking photos for an online auction and I had to experiment a bit to get usable photos. Some tips or instructions would have been appreciated. And it would be nice if the camera stand could be adjusted up and down."
4,Does the job,"I was recently hired to shoot hundreds of small items for a catalog. Rather than take my large light setup, I took the studio-in-a-box to the shoot. The little unit was left on all day for 3 sessions on three days. The photos look fine and I saved a great deal of set-up time. All this unit really needs to make it perfect is some sort of diffuser/reflector for the front (to help lessen glare on glass bottles and such). The included camera stand isn't quite strong enough for many DSLRS (including mine) but most photographers already own a decent tripod or two. It paid for itself many times over."
2,ALLOW ME TO BE FRANK...BUY MoC INSTEAD OF CRITERION.,"The features on Criterion disc is almost horrible. Not only the image quality is not good as expected, but also the special features are not superior to other editions. Just buy the EUREKA MoC editions #13. The EUREKA one included all features on Criterion disc, and besides, a bonus booklet and ALEX COX introduction. The image quality was more proper for a dual-layer disc."
3,nice Business,Book arrived in pristine condition.Shipping took awfully long.Let customers know you are shipping out of the United States.However customer service is quite good.
4,You gotta release this on DVD ASAP!!!!,"This is a good movie! I've heard of this movie ever scince i was about 11 or 12 years old! And now i had finally watched it! This movie makes you wanna cry! And whoever said that this movie was stupid than it is oviously that they don't have any taste in real drama movies! They need to stop trippin and release this movie on DVD! And none of those region 2-4 or PAL versions. Oh and hopefully in the future they could remake this movie ""China Girl"" with different actors! Great movie! The Best!Dee K. Smalls."
2,Better to borrow this book,"The book storyline is written similarily to the ""Celestine Prophecy"". The story runs a bit fast and ends up being unrealistic. However, this author ignores details to his spiritual truth or much of any. Leaves the reader more dazed than directed."
5,great live show,"I just came back from Reggae on the River where I caught this band from Africa.In a word fantastic. By wearing the mask, Lagbaja is representing Everyman and will continue to wear the mask until everyman is treated equally. The song ""Simple Yes or No"" is asking for a straight answer from governments be they African or American. His band mostly dressed in traditional African clothes played and danced with the kind of energy that comes from African tradition. This album captures some of that energy. If you get the chance don't miss seeing them in person."
1,Waste Side Story,"I guess I will take it upon myself to give the first negative review of this CD. Simply put, this CD shows the current miserable state of the ""classical"" music industry. Pops is one thing, but albums such as this are really used to bait those listeners who want to feel like they appreciate ""classical"" music without actually knowing anything about it.If you like to watch PBS for your classical music (Michael Junior and Andre Rieu, anybody?) then this CD is for you. If you prefer to be inspired, challenged, and rewarded, then your days are numbered (and this CD is NOT for you!)Cheers!"
3,"ahhh, not too bad...",I was a bit disappointed with this album. I was looking for more of the old gospel blues like Rev. Gary Davis. The Gospel on this cd is more Black Gospel choir style. I should have looked a little closer. I am somewhat new to the country blues genre and purchased a number of cd's at the same time trying to explore various artists. This also had more newer songs and artists than I liked but still enjoyed many of the older songs.
2,Disappointed,"Was somewhat disappointed with this watch - it is attractive, but has a a much smaller face than I was expecting. And it is very hard to read - the gold hands don't stand out well enough against the black face. I wish I had chosen differently."
4,What a series!,"Meeting all the delightful residents of Alpine can be a challenge. Make a list as you go (that's what I did). You will be well rewarded as this series progresses; it provides a lot of chuckles, and you hardly care who-dun-it. As I write, I have read down to ""Icon"" and was only disappointed once!"
2,Disappointed,"I thought these were going to be made in the USA. They are not. They are just mass produced out of the country, I will not order from this vendor again."
2,Not Literary Tortue,"If you're reading this book, then don't thank your professor. There are better textbooks out there, but at lease it short. It's ok if you're taking a summer school Modern literature class. I wouldn't use it in any of my classes otherwise - but I was forced to as a student."
1,Big Disappointment,"I certainly should have paid more attention to the description of this movie, so I blame myself for my ignorance in buying it. However, I ""listened"" to all the reviews that talk about what a wonderful story this is. Not so. Rekindled love is one thing, but cheating on one's spouse is another. That makes the rekindled love cheap and cruel and heartless. Having been cheated on by my first husband, I do not see the ""beauty"" of this ""heartfelt"" film of love. It is not at all right to justify cheating on a husband or wife. It is beyond devastating, and it is not at all innocent."
5,Review: murderous medicine,"Baumslag's account of the use of typhus fever by Nazi doctors is a detailed account of the atrocities that can occur when human beings misuse knowledge and technology. Written in a personal voice, Baumslag, not only provides multiple historical references, she also provides the personal touch of one who understands persecution, abuse and ethics.Historically accurate and technically rich, this book should be advised reading for those interested in the holocaust, the history of medicine, and public health."
3,Good Book With Some Errors,"I bought this book because it's an important one -- and is touted as one of the best available on Nazi typhus experiments.However, there are errors in Murderous Medicine that make me question its scholarship. For me, the most grave is on page 64, where the author states that HCN (Zyklon B ) was used in Treblinka. Carbon Monoxide gas was used in the Aktion Reinhard camps. This error could create confusion going forward, especially with younger or less experienced scholars. And just this one factual error makes me seriously question the research in the rest of the book -- in spite of the fact that I am almost positive that the information about typhus experimentation is solid.I wish I were able to recommend this book; but in the present edition, I just can't."
1,Food Mutilator,"This is going back to the store.The vegetables in that picture were not processed by this machine.When I put the first vegetable in, I was horrified to see how mutilated it was. As I used this machine, I quickly came to the conclusion that this should not be marketed.The slicing feature produced unevenly chopped vegetable remnants: I'd get three slices and then a few chunks followed by small bits thrown out all over the counter. The chopper would have blown bits of vegetable out of the vegetable chute if I hadn't kept the chute stop in place because the lid doesn't fit when the processor is in chopper mode.Additionally, if I were keeping this machine, I would have a hard time storing it. It has several odd shaped, sharp implements that do not store easily with the machine."
5,Britney Rulez!,"When I first heard Baby One More Time, I thought it was someone older singing it. I spent the next week trying to figure out who the singer was. Then I heard a commercial for a concert of Britney's with that song on it! I bought the cd the next day! I really liked all the other songs on the cd too. They were all cool and funked up! Then Sometimes became a hit, and then Crazy! I love the way she sings and the STOP! part is really cool! Britney all the way! She's the best!"
4,It was great for a single!,This single was great! I usually don't like singles because of how many songs they usuallu have. The stop remix is better than the original. I'm glad to see a pop star with an ant-trash mouth!
4,Pretty good,"This remix is awesome and very dancable, although the lyrics aren't the best. It's a little pricey but the beat and rhythm is incredible. Recommended for those who are big fans of pop music."
4,"WHITE POWDER COATED 12"" ANTENNA","BUYER BEWARE!!!! This antenna is STURDY AND NON-FLEXIBLE!!! If you put your vehicle through an automatic car wash with spinning cleaning heads, it will break the mounting bolt shaft on this antenna and toss it from your vehicle! The antenna does not flex whatsoever.Now that THAT is over, it's a nice looking antenna, VERY sturdy, just take if off before you run your vehicle through the automatic car wash...."
4,Important Reference,"A compilation of classic results in the field. Not the book to read for an introduction to the subject but indispensable as a reference. Better than Lamb in my opinion, but if you're going to buy one you should get the other."
2,Waste of money!,"I bought two of these kits for my sons, ages 3 and 7. I was extremely disappointed in how pale the colors are when rubbed---not at all the bright, exciting colors you see on the tv commercial. Also, they make it sound like you get TONS of pictures/paper, but in reality it's not much for the money. They also make it sound like the pictures/paper are huge, but their ""small"" piece of paper is about the size of two credit cards, and their ""poster-size"" is actually about 8 by 10 inches. The stencils that are included are not easy to use, the ""brush"" tip of the included tool is useless, and the texture plates don't work very well. It took my sons about 20 minutes to exhaust the whole kit. Very, very disappointing. I could have purchased LOADS of coloring books and crayons for the same money! I'm giving it a generous 2 stars because I did get a few minutes of peace until the novelty wore off, and I appreciate every minute I can get!"
1,A Rainbow of Color,"These looked great when I was considering purchasing new dinner plates, but in reality they look like they should be used at a picnic. Probably not what you want at your table every night."
3,Strange product,I bought these as a gift and was disappointed that they look like trays instead of plates. I like the colors.
3,Interesting stories of real people but a little slow...,The people that this nurse treated were very interesting but some of the stories of her home life are less than exciting and not worth a reader's time.
3,different,"cut but intersting. the regular mode isn't that fun but the bonus games are. definitly play it before buying it, because I know people who totally love/hate it."
4,marc,"great!had everything I needed! my a/c went out on my car and I was dying in the heat and no auto part stores had a book on the 87 trans am.They all said the same thing,""buy the software and then go on the internet and punch in the code we give you""! I needed it right next to me to refer to so I ordered it cheaper than the auto parts stores,and utilized the wiring schematics while they were sitting right next to me when i needed to refer to it!"
4,great pretty reliable,"I bought this when it first came out at least 6 years ago, it still works well, but some minor things suck. Best buy installed it and did not add the ground correctly so on cold days (due to metal shrink) the ground contact would move I fixed this and it works fine. Also, the tv worked well before everything went to digital now I would think u need a tuner to see tv, but you can still hook a dvd player and backup camera to so now worries, I am also able to hook my ipod to it to show video (if you buy the correct cable). the only thing that bothers me now is how it rattles on idle, but this is not a problem with the stereo I have prothane bushings installed so it sees more vibration. Overall, I would say great buy because I still find this radio to have tons of teh features of a more expensive set without a tv screen completely flipping out."
4,Thumbs Up!,"I have tried several programs, and have learned the most easily with this format. Lessons are divided into different social situations (greetings, introductions, shopping, etc.) As with any program, it does take a certain amount of application. This program is nice because, you can learn while doing housework, driving, excercising. All phrases are spoken first in English, then in Spanish; you do not have to be constantly looking at the book, in order to study."
5,"If you travel, you MUST buy this!","This travel router provides me the flexibility to work frmo anywheere in my hotel room meaning I am not confined to the desk provided that usually is in some dark corner of the room. In fact, if I choose, I can now even work and surf the internet from the comfort of my bed :-)"
4,Great product for the money,"This product is fast and easy to use. Set-up is a snap and it works great in hotels and conference centers!! I use mine all the time., both in my hotel and on the road. Easy to carry too!!"
2,Educational but disappointing,"This album was educational, but there was so few true dance tracks; and it disappointed me. The dance music market is the only reason why I even like R&B; (of any kind) in the first place.As educational as this compilation album's theme may sound; it was just so disappointing that there was only one hip hop track that sampled a funk song! :-("
2,Doesn't interest my daughter at all,"My daughter received this as a gift for her 1st birthday. She is now almost 16 months old and it has never really interested her. It's a cute toy - with the 3 removable frogs and the catchy songs and letter buttons to push, but it just doesn't interest her. She will fiddle with it for a couple of minutes and then move on to something else. I just don't think it really does enough or has enough to do on it to hold her attention. I have a son who is 2 & 1/2 and he has never really shown any interest in it either."
2,"Fun, educational but HAZARDOUS!!!","I got this toy for my son because I thought it has many educational features. After a week, the paint is chipped on one of the frogs. Grant it my son was probably chewing on the frog because he is teething. But that is what makers of kid toys should expect and prepare for. Since the paint on the frogs is not durable, I have to confiscate all the frogs and just allow my son to play with the bus. He still enjoys it but this is not the full potential for this toy. I am thinking of returning it because there is no toy educational enough that I should put my child's health in danger. Paint chips are just NOT acceptable in children's toys. Leapfrogs should know better and invest a little more in ensuring this toy is of health and safety standard. I am very disappointed."
5,Thanks for the Memories!,This is a superb review of a superb musical era. Anyone who lived the music of these years will love this set.
5,This book is SO CUTE!,"When I was little, my parents (mostly my dad) read this to me all the time and I loved it! It is so sweet and I think every partent should read it to their kids!"
5,FOUND,"This was the only place I found this battery. Thanks again, I will be buy more products from you again."
5,Really great,"I think this book is the best approximation I've found of someone passing on the things you learn if you have a good therapist.Lots of good lessons here on how to be a grown up, even though none of us tend to feel like one.Entirely worth the read if you can find a copy. I saw some really expensive ones, but eventually found one that was reasonably priced."
1,"Poor quality, bad glazing","These little tang horses should be quite nice, and would be except that the glaze is about 1/8"" thick and dripping off their noses, destroying any charm that they possess. Basically they are ugly and look like crap and I resent that my Mom sent them to me based on [...] having them on their web site!They were packaged well, but still one had a broken tail."
1,Bait and switch,"Didn't get the solid urinal shown but the thinner Medline junk. One leaked horribly, another leaked a bit, and the third is OK for now. They come in a paper envelope via US Mail and I'd have to pay to send back, and wait for reimbursement. And postage would exceed original cost. Plus how exactly do I send back used urinals???????????????? If you want the item shown in the photo look elsewhere."
5,Great for fishermen/Kayakers,"This is your #1 tool for number 1 when fishing or kayaking. Works great, can take a beating, and comes back for more."
2,Poor Quality Product,Poor cap attachment design. The cap keeps coming loose and falling off. Cheaply made. You get what you pay for!
2,Ghastly...in a bad way.,"I have the sneaking suspicion that the year 1999 is the problem with this record, as much as the label. This is the tribute I didn't want to see, the last gasp of the old industrial scene showing why the genre had lost all it's original vitality by 99, following it's outright surrender to 909 acid house. Toward even that end, most of the acts on this record should hardly be producing tribute tracks...what are they paying homage for, obscurity? Ah, what I wouldn't do to see the early 242 hits from 'Geography' and 'No Comment' revisited by the current electroclash synthpop bands, who at any rate have much more in debt to 242 & EBM than the warmed (wormed) over Skinny Puppy supplicants here."
1,Bad design that's costly to check out,"Using Backsaver's design to hold an expensive computer would be unnervingly risky; for feet and wrists would be unergonomic; and probably wouldn't even look good -- 3-wheeled design is very unstable.- Bottom beam position pushes feet back to a position that could end up uncomfortable.- Bottom beam height can't be stepped over without bumping against platform.- Platform tilt mechanism has built-in 1/2"" up and down play that can't be tightened out.- Platform lean can't be adjusted out.- Both swivel and height need to be adjusted to avoid bending wrists unergonomically.- Teak color is unusually light.Using Richmond Wholesale's distribution would make it work out so that checking it out yourself would be costly -- Unit performed as shown, so Richmond described it as nondefective, said the shipping was nonrefundable, and said the shipping cost $28 a unit.- UPS ground return shipping cost another $14 a unit."
5,It was good,"This was a good book, I'm 16 and while I did not quite do everything that Tracy did, I have done some of them and I can relate to her experiences. For black teenage girls growing up in the inner-city or even in the suburbs this is a book for you to read, because u will mostly definitely understand the drama in Traci's life. But this is a good book and I would recommend this book to anyone."
4,"Better than ""Grim""","I think this series from Canada is way better than NBC's ""Grim."" It reminds me a lot of Jim Butcher's novels ""The Dresden Files."" Great cast of characters and imaginative plots."
3,LOST GIRL,"I bought this box set after waiting fruitlessly for months for Season II to reach iTurnes in the US. I received the DVD in the mail 1/7/13, one week before the season 3 premiere. I thought I would have plenty of time to watch this before season 3 started, but instead, I received a damaged product and had to exchange it for a new one, which will not arrive until season 3 starts, I am sure. A replacement is nice, but expedited shipping would be better... They don't exactly give you that option when you attempt to exchange an item."
5,finally the 2nd season dvd cometh!,"Lost girl season 2 is even better than season 1.the stories are better, the romances are more intense, and its filled with new action packed adventures! I just cant wait till bo and Dyson fall in love again.in the meantime, they share adventures, rescue victims, and defeat the evil foes. kenzi finally gets her own romance,too.She also helps Dyson try 2 get his love for bo back, even though he's found his 1st love Ciara is still alive, and tries 2 feel love 4 her.will bo and Dyson fall back into love?we shall see.go Dyson, ur hot!♥ ME SOME DYSON;)♥You cant miss with a great cast ensemble in bo,kenzi,dyson,trick,dysons police partner,and the great writing.and sometimes evil vex.go lost girl!"
3,Where are the cupcakes?,"I should have read the other reviews when I bought this -- I did specifically buy it because I'd been to the Buttercup Bakery and loved their cupcakes and wanted to make them. There are some cake recipes and some frosting recipes, and I expect I'll be able to cobble together something yummy that I can bake in a cupcake wrapper (though for how long, not too sure...and I hate guessing). The recipes sound lovely, in any case.But really, guys, if you put cupcakes on the cover, people are going to expect cupcakes inside.[I write knitting books and if I put a sweater on the cover of one of my books without putting the pattern in the same book, I'd never hear the end of it. :-)]"
3,Falcons Egg,"I really didn't like the book that much because. For one it went slow the writer didnt give a good discription because I couldint really see the character in my head. Some of the chapters were really long it didn't give any breaks at all. So next time im not going to pick a book called the Falcons Egg.The worst part in the book was in the biggining. They didn't discribe any really good details of where they were at I didn't know if they were outside. Or inside. The only time I really knew they were outside is when they were talking about were they got the egg. That's the only time I knew through most of the book.The thing the author did really good was when they were discribing the setting. Just this once, It was in the forest. They were tring to the egg back to the mother. And the conflict, the writer did a pretty good job on that. It was funny when they were fighting. About people that wanted to keep the egg and the other people that wanted to give it back so it wouldn't die."
1,Probably the cheesiest ad for an online dating service I've ever seen,"Yes, inside the box was a free one-year membership to the online dating service in the movie. But, why would anyone in their right mind want to use them? Let's see: our heroine ends up accidentally going out on a date with and discovering her would be amour is none other than her widowed father--whose lies on his own application started with his age. We go on to see the 50ish widow her father is dating lying about her age and ending up with a 15 year old (oh yes, he lied about his age, too) on her doorstep claiming they were soulmates. Well, they did have some interesting things in common. Add to that the crying neurotic guy, the 50ish guy who really wanted an 18 year old, etc. The movie itself lacked the timing or style to be anything but a 'dog' and the advert for the online dating service just sealed the deal for me."
1,Worse than you can imagine,"So, how bad can a movie with John Cusack and Diane Lane be? Trust me--pretty bad. It's not touching; it's not funny; there's no chemistry. Nothing. And the writing is just awful. Every attempt at humor falls flat. I found myself wondering why this movie was even made. Don't waste your time."
1,Disappointing,"This is truly a ""dog"" of a movie, but i purchased this for the advertised gag reel. Hello! A gag reel implies at least a couple of bloopers; this had only one (the scene where Elizabeth Perkins throw a package of meat at John Cusack). Although that blooper in itself was hilarious I was expecting more. Darn."
3,MUST like DOGS!,"Like the dogs in the movie, the film is cute & cuddly! Other than that, it is mostly forgetable!"
3,"Worth a rental, if you are an incurable romantic...","Don't take this seriously, and you can have a good time. It's a talented cast with a muddled script, and as a prior reviewer notes, it would have benefited from having more canines in it--after all, they have perfected love, and we humans sure haven't. Not every movie has be a masterpiece to be worth seeing. I saw this one while nursing an actively broken heart, yet I rooted for the main characters to solve their problems and get together. I felt a little better after watching it, and that's not a small thing."
1,Torture of Pleasure?,I enjoyed other romantic comedy films by Cusack but wow! Out of 100's of films I have watched over the years this one will stick out as THE worst. Problems I had: The characters are without any depth or realism. The dialogue was fast and full of punch-lines like you are watching a poorly written 'Friends' episode at high speed while on coke. It was torture I can't imagine the hollywood executives who typed this film up unless they were reading Cosmo and taking hits of peyote. The personalities and lifestyles that the characters inhabited had no roots in reality as I know it. The film didn't allow for any person to connect with a single thing in this film. I seriously thought I was watching aliens who just looked like human and were trying to imatate humans. If you found yourself connecting to the people in this film I want you to call me so I can bring you to the circus. Then we can get you many dates fo sure!
2,BORING...,"Incredibly slow moving; I almost turned it off mid way. What I did like about it was the interaction Sarah had with her sisters and her father. Other than that, it is low on plot and they could have finished the movie in about 45 minutes. Great actors, poor movie."
3,3 and a half pretty good,"this movie is a tolerable, feel good, pretty funny, all right movie. they gathered some pretty good actors. its one of those movies that is not great but u gotta see it. it was slow at times. a lot of people will like it alot though. its not the type of movie that u would watch over and over again. then again this movie has some hilarious parts. great first time watch. good for rainy days. what is there else to say. diffinetly wont apply to everybodys taste. wont win awards.this is the miami reviewer. PEACE."
3,"great cast, very poor story line",i loved the cast members.. but what was up with that bland story line? OMG. i don't know if it was the story line or the directing but i was so disappointed in the film. it was a shame. well at least i got to see some of my favorite actresses of all time in there :) and john cusack. :)
2,Neither Character had a dog!?!?!,"The moral of the story: You won't be happy unless you have a man.Diane Lane (Sarah) plays a divorced woman who has decided to start dating again. She comes from a large, nosey family and it's hard to keep track of them all. Was that the brother-in-law or the brother? Is that her sister, her friend, her sister-in-law or her father's girlfriend?To put it bluntly, Sarah's character is pathetic. She doesn't have any confidence, self-respect, or special attributes that make her special. It was cheesy how everyone in Sarah's life wanted her to find a mate ~ including the guy that worked the deli counter at the supermarket ~ and until she did she was treated like less of a person.This story wasn't romantic or funny."
4,sweet film,"Is it predictable? Yes. Is it formulaic? Yes. But is it entertaining, funny and witty? Yes! It's a sweet feel good film."
3,"So,so","It was an enjoyable watch, but not one that I will repeat.Maybe I've seen too many of this kind of movie, but it was very predictable. Acting was well enough done, but the plot was a little ""lame""."
4,Great Dialog on a Standard Plot,"In many ways, ""Must Love Dogs"" is a standard romantic comedy. Two recently divorced people find each other on an internet dating service. While it is obvious to the audience that these two should be together, they suffer through a wide variety of misunderstandings and mishaps until they finally realize what we knew and get together at the end of the movie (I hope I didn't give it away.)This would normally rate 3 stars - an average and nice movie. But I gave it 4 stars because of the dialog. The writing is quick witted and many of the jokes are surprising and unexpected. I laughed out loud many times and that bumped this movie from 3 stars to 4."
3,Looking for love in all the wrong places,"Diane Lane plays a recently-divorced woman whose family cannot resist trying to fix her up. She goes through the world's worst dates in order to find the right man. When she does find him, a series of misadventures conspire to keep them apart. This movie is totally predictable, but it's light, funny, and stars two charming actors in Lane and John Cusack."
5,"Love, Love this Movie . . . .","I never watch this movie in the theatres. I borrowed the DVD of this movie from my best friend who said that I would like it. She was wrong because I truly love, love this movie. I like all the actors in this movie and the dogs. Diana Lane does a superb job as a recent divorcee who is being encourage by her family to not give up and to start dating again. I even liked the butcher at the local grocery store. It is after this that I decided to buy it for my own movie collection. Now I can watch it anytime I want. It is a sweet, funny movie that makes you feel good."
5,Jared Louche - The Glamdustrial Rock Machine,"I first became aware of Jared Louche through his awesome weekly radio show, The Glamdustrial Rock Machine, on UK rock station TOTALROCK.COM. If you are open to all types of music...industrial, ambient, jazz, rock, punk and/or Dixieland...Jared is your man and you should checkout his show on TR. Anyway, this is an amazing CD that crosses all genres of music and I recommend it to anyone looking for something different. This is Jared's take on some great pieces by artists such as...Roxy Music, Frank Sinatra, Air, Iggy Pop, The Stooges, Leonard Cohen, PIL and his own band Chemlab. Jared has an experimental edge like no one I've heard before. It worth getting just for the Roxy Music cover, ""In Every Dreamhome a Heartache."" This album has moments of jazz, techno, industrial-metal and a very smooth ambient beat; nothing is overdone. This is not your typical cover album this one is actually good."
3,"29,823 pages--no table of contents","29,823 pages of content on two disks with no table of contents... Without guidance, I find that the wealth of material - which may be great stuff - is unwieldy to unusable. I gave 3 stars for the possibility of good content. What I saw was an accurate reflection of the title of the 2 disk set. The attempt to follow a link to other text contained on the disk (from a copied web page) did work in my one test of that feature. If you have to search from material that is from the government anyway, a web search seems as easy--and cheaper."
2,NOT a low carb cookbook,"I should have known that with Rodale as the publisher, this would not be a typical low carb cookbook. There is a push towards foods they consider healthy--soy, whole grains, lots of fruit. Fine, but not in my diet. If you like Prevention magazine recipes, you'll probably like this book. I'll put mine on eBay."
2,this is not electronic music mix nor orbital's new release,"this is a regular back to mine.. ie the artists play their selected tracks when they are with friends or at home...so it is what the hartnol brothers listen to at home when not making music..this is not an electronic mix cd...the tracks are variable in style ranging from jethro tull a classic 60's/70's rock band to plaid a true electronic band....like other reviews mentioned, the cd lack continuity...it sounds like a bad amature mixing song.....they could have done more work on trying to mix the songs together(we are talking about orbital,they know how to mix songs right)....if you want to buy this cd: dont buy it thinking it is another orbital release...buy it if you liked the other back to mine releases"
1,Not so Safe -the balls can hurt you,We bought this thinking it would be safe for the kids. However after playing with it for 15 minutes they were hurt. Dart Tag is a safer product which my kids prefer.
5,Brilliant yet so tragic,"It took me 4 months to get this VHS. I had never heard of Jacqueline du Pre until the movie. It was hard to understand such talent cut short at 28 years old with MS. Having just watched the Jerry Louis Telethon and having a form of MS myself (Myasthenia Gravis) which fortunatly is under control - I simply had to watch this remarkable ""EMI Classic"" again. I have to agree with other comments that it was to short - but remarkable non the less. Probably the greatest Cellist of the century or at any time it is a marvelous tribute. Needless to say I have the book and several CD's. I wish there was more to see."
4,Touching and heartwarming!,"As a pet owner and lover, I was so touched to read a book with so many wonderful and inspirational stories about pets. So many of the stories included in the book were about the strange comforting and healing powers of our ""furry friends"". After each one, I would look at my beautiful cat with tears in my eyes and just hug her, wanting to hang onto one of the best friends, teachers, and healers I have ever had! It was a sensational book and one that I was very sad to see end."
1,NO stars!,"From reading the other reviews, I guess there may be heartwarming stories in the book - but the first one I read was the last. I recently had to put to sleep my aged little dog, my best friend, and upon purchasing the book turned to a chapter I thought might help. It was ghastly, an ode to irresponsible pet ownership from the beginning to the end. The dog's 10 yr old mother is impregnated unknownst to owners who discover this little fact only when she's giving birth; the dog loses a leg due to an accident while roaming at large; and finally, his agonizing death from an attack by another dog - again because he is allowed to roam at large, guess the owners are REAL slow learners - it was an awful thing to read, this poor dog suffered so unnecessarily at the hands of these people. I was going to throw the book away, but why should the publishers profit by this? I took it back to the bookstore and returned it."
4,Old Faithful,"I bought a Vic Firth Pepper Mill just like this one about 10 years ago, and it is still going strong. I took one star away because the grind is sometimes a slight bit more coarse than I like, and I have a hard time adjusting it to a finer grind. It takes a bit of extra twisting of the knob at the top to make sure the grind is right, but I do get it eventually. At any rate, I have still really enjoyed using this US made product and wouldn't hesitate to purchase another pepper mill from Vic Firth... that is if the one I have ever stops working. It works every bit as well as it did a decade ago, so I'm not sure it will ever need replacing."
4,Wonderful Horse Story,"Ken is bored with school and doesn't apply himself so fails English. He is given a horse to take care of in order to make him take responsibility. He chooses a filly and names her ""Flicka"". How he tames the filly and earns her trust and love, how he overcomes his father's dislike of the Albino's bloodlines in Flicka and how he earns his father's respect is the meat of the story.I loved this series when I was a teenager, and still enjoy it as an adult.Its great for anyone who loves horses."
5,Love this book!,"I have read this book a number of times, and it still stands up to the test of time.Flicka is a special horse, and has a special bond with the young hero of this story.My Friend Flicka is the kind of book that you can read again and again, from childhood to adulthood."
5,YOU HAVE GOT TO READ THIS BOOK!,"This is my favorite book ever! I carry it around with me everywhere! This book will touch your heart and soul, and you'll never forget it! Mary O'Hara's style of writing makes you grow to love Flicka and Ken! Flicka, a wild filly who is thought to be loco because all of her descendants are, is the only filly Ken, a young day dreamer, will have. His father is outraged when Ken will have no other! When they bring Flicka in, she is so afraid, she tries to jump a barbed wire fence that is obviously too high! The McLaughlin's can't afford anything but barbed wire fencing, and Flicka is torn up. Because she is so hurt, Ken can get close to her, and soon becomes her whole world. When hail comes, he threw himself over her head to protect her, and reads to her for hours, sometimes he'll just gaze at her. If you like horses, this book will make you love horses! A must read for ANYBODY who is the least bit interested in horses!"
4,Eye-opening and thorough review for Mormon and non-Mormon alike.,"Although Mr. Palmer got bogged down in the details in a few places his ""Insider's View"" is both eye-opening and thorough. He takes on the hard tasks of digging for the facts and providing the whole story that the LDS leaders are content to leave buried and whitewashed. He documents his narratives so well that as one reads on, it's futile to dispute Mr. Palmer's findings. It's really only a matter of what the reader will do with the facts that he has uncovered. Although Mr. Palmer remains a committed member of the LDS church, I think he views have switched and an emphasis has shifted in his mind and heart from Joseph Smith to Jesus Christ. I certainly hope that this book will find it's way into many member's hands and that a similar transformation will take place throughout the entire church."
5,Shockingly eye-opening,"My eyes have been opened! Palmer's book is a breathlessly daring and bold testament that REALLY tells the truth about Mormonism ---using that church's own history and documentation as the basis for its condemnation.Palmer has relentlessly combed church archives and many other historical sources to open up the real, unvarnished truth about Mormonism's origins; and in the process, proves 1,000 times over how and why that church is wrong, false, manipulative and groundless.The raw-wound truths about Joseph Smith and his early life, and how and why he did many of the things he did are things that every Latter Day Saint (and any other seeker-of-truth) needs to become informed of; otherwise, you are just hiding your head in the sand, and believing platitudes and lies that have been changed and prettied-up to make them believable over many decades.Palmer's writing style is eminently readable and compelling. This book is simply a Must-Read."
2,"""Not What I Expected.....""","This was dissapointing! I was expecting a little more history about Sturgis and how it all came to be, also I would've liked to see alot more motorcycles, makes & models......."
2,Kiss Jada's (...) Goodbye,"First things first, Jadkiss states that he is the best rapper to come on the scene since Biggie Smalls. (...) I will admit that i though that his album was gonna be the bomb! Well when i heard the album, i was annoyed (...)! Jadakiss has got crazy lyrical limitations and it shows clearly. How many songs can u have about the number of times u bust ur heater? It just wares down on my ears. Pitiful tracks are "" Jada's Got a Gun"", "" Knock Yourself Out"" , "" Cruisin(with an atrocious performance by Snoop!), and the rest of the album. The only bangers on this album are ""We Gonna Make It"" and the Premier produced "" None of Y'all Better"". Another dope song is the Nas assisted ""Show Disicpline"". Other than that, Jada's lyrical ability is average at best and he is getting over because rap has become stagnant over the past few years. He's not one of the top MC's and he needs to get his skills up 4 he challenges dope MC's like Talib Kweli,Nas,and OutKast. 1 Luv"
1,DO NOT BUY THIS ALBUM,"I bought this album expecting a hip hop classic, I was dead wrong. This has to be the worst album I've ever heard. The beats and lyrics are below average. If you're a real hip hop fan you wont like this album. If you want an album worth the money get Beanie Sigel - The Reason."
2,Kiss It Goodbye,"I am a fan of the Ruff Ryders and The Lox... The Lox didn't do well and they admitted it on their debut ""Money, Power, and Respect"" for Bad Boy Records.. They did the smart thing and went over to the Ruff Ryder camp where they belong... Their 2000 release ""We R The Streets"" was descent, better than their debut album though... Then the hype began for JADAKISS!. This guy was and is appearing everywhere and everyone making so much a big deal about him.. His debut solo effort Kiss Tha Game Goodbye full of 21 trax is just bad... I gave this album 2 stars because of the nice job Jada did on ""Put Ya Hands Up"" and the collabo with Nas on ""Show Discipline"". The rest of this cd though is just horrible!. I recommend that no one picks this album up, and JADA, do us all a favor, stick with sheek and styles as the Lox, because wen it comes to SOlo, it and you don't fit.."
4,Well...,"This is interesting. It seems to be a love or hate album. Ive seen its the best CD ever; great lyrics, phat beats all that or its a horrible album; commercial, unoriginal. Let me break it down. While Jada may not be as great as Biggie, he is incredible as a lyricist. To those who say it production was sloppy, boo to you. The production is solid. It varies in style but finds a way to fit to the rapper. As far as unoriginality is concerned, it is a little lacking. I would have like to have heard a little better material. He didn't seem to vary it much. However, it is a street album. He represented all the topics he touched very well. For you who dont like hard hip-hop, get some Nelly. Those who do will enjoy it. Those who think its not real enough, get a life. Just cause its not underground does not make it bad. All in all, good CD. Could use tweaking, but good."
4,Not what i expected,"This cd is really a 3n a half ratin but i gave it 4 stars cause i really like jadakiss. This cd has some good songs like the for sures (knock your self out n put ya ahnds up) but other good songs are on my way,nasty girl,im a gangsta,we goin make it. he has some tight beats n his lyrics are very good. but i feel he could have made his debut better i think he will be one of the next big rap stars like todays big ones (examples-DMX,Jay-z) im looking forward to his next cd n i hope a better effort"
2,FAR FROM A CLASSIC,"Two stars because:-too many commercial tracks-I've heard it all before-Everybody in New York know ""Kiss"" aint no gangsterbut it is slightly entertaining.."
4,a must have,"For fans of Six Feet Under, this is a must have. It is true that some of the more personal stuff, like the poems, are a bit weak, but most of the essays are strong and insightful.Fans might also want to check out the collection Considering Alan Ball. I just picked this up, and it has great essays about Six Feet Under, American Beauty, and some of Ball's early plays as well."
3,Not for ponds!,"Make sure you are purchasing this for non submersible applications. This bulb looks identical to those which go in ponds, but is not for that. Otherwise, they are a reasonably good buy. Fortunately, they fit in my kitchen tracks."
5,Good Service and Product,The halogen bulbs I ordered were sent promptly. The price was good -- the best I've found after years of ordering these light bulbs. These bulbs are not easy to find so I'm especially glad Amazon put me in contact with a supplier.
3,Add It To The Category Of Literature In Exile,"This novel is, in fact, as advertised: a modern-day women's Decameron, using this format to make a number of pointed comments about the state of Soviet society as it went into decline. The structure makes the book easy to pick up and put down. There is a deeper continuity within the work as well, as the stories the women tell from day to day, and their reactions to one another, provide nuance to each individual character.How to categorize this book? Should Voznesenskaya be considered a Soviet writer, or a Russian one? She left what was then the Soviet Union in 1980, and this volume was published in 1985. The author therefore falls into that odd category of writers who are in exile, and further and further from the wellspring of her inspiration. The status of the author doesn't make her work less legitimate, simply harder to place in context.Verdict: worth reading, but problematic."
2,Great Pictures,"This guide offers little concrete information regarding history, train/bus/car routes, nothing on hostels, and very little on prices, other than the occasional ""Great Britain is expensive"". The pictures, however, are wonderful, and incline one to be far more likely to visit a sight than the dreary pages upon pages of description found in other guides. In short, helpful for visualizing Great Britain, but not much else."
4,Escoffier,This culinary arts book is packed full of much useful and not always readily available information as in most cookbooks. Bought for our son who though not a professional chef is very knowledgeable regarding many methods of cooking. It is written for the most part as a chef's encyclopedia and not for the amateur cook. Since he has not received this gift as yet I can not give any feedback on it's use.
5,Patti La Belle (The DVD collection),"track listings: (5 tracks total)on my own, new attitude, oh people, somebody loves you baby/you know who it is, & if you asked me to."
4,Almost unique,"Almost unique in American cinema and by far Tone of the strangest movies to come out of the counter-culture era, up there with Billy Jack and Easy Rider. That was a crazy time to be young take your pick wandering around the camp with little or no supervision or wandering around town with no supervision picking fights with rednecks and stealing cars. Cultural norms were being erased and rewritten so fast it was hard to stay on top of it all.The book does have a deeper message but the movie is just good old fashioned fun."
4,Don't take this book seriously......,"I'm only 30 pages into this book and I'm already noticing some things that don't make sense.The author says something like Jones would calm himself down when he felt stressed out by singing the Beatles' song ""Imagine There's No Heaven"". There is no Beatles song by that name and the only song that comes close to it, ""Imagine"" by John Lennon came out in 1979/80 after the Jonestown tragedy.In the fervor to be one of the first books written about JT and the massacre, I think the author may have embellished things here and there. Read it for the historical purpose but don't take what is written as fact. Go with one of the later written books if you want accuracy. Anything by Rebecca Moore is excellent. She lost 2 of her sisters, Annie and Carolyn in Guyana."
2,lasted 2 days,Bought two of these bulbs and each one only lasted two days in my fiber optic light. Really disappointed in this purchase.
2,Bummer,"Well, it lasted a week. I should have listened to the other reviews. Try to buy this light in a store instead of online.UPDATE:After posting this I was contacted by the company and they refunded my money. It was very nice fo them to do so and was not expected. I gave them another star for it. Thank you"
5,Fantastic,I looked everywhere for this bulb. I needed it to fix a christmas decoration I love. I received it only 4 days after ordering the buld. Great transaction and so far so good on the bulb.
5,An alternate history that could have been easily happened!,"The Domination is an all to easily alternate history that, with a bit more push from only a few points in history could have happened. My family were 'Tory' during the Real First American Civil War aka the Revolutionary War. I believe that the Alternative History in this book illustrates another world that very nearly happened.An intriging idea and although dark, no real light is shed when history is trully happening.Must read for all interested in the alternate!"
5,JEZZRO CHRISTMAS GUITAR,"all solo guitar - as a guitar player myself, I very much appreciate this man's gift and enjoyed the CD"
1,Not so fast !,"The real reason John F Kennedy didn't invade Cuba and save the poor Cubin people can be found in the national archives. Or just google search (Operation Northwoods). Remember, there's two sides to every story. Maybe the end does justifies the means."
2,All re-recordings,"None of these songs are the original Cameo-Parkway recordings. But the album cover is one from the early 60s with the lettering style similar to one used on an early Cameo-Parkway Chubby Checker album, so it's rather misleading."
2,All The Best 2CD Set,"This 2 CD set is a re-package of two earlier releases on Teec. ""All The Best"" was released as Chubby Checker Classics 2003. The Bonus Cd is a straight re-issue of his ""Knock Down The Walls"" 2007. If you want this 2CD set just remember if you have the other two you don't need it. BUT, it is a great way to have the 2 seperate CDs in one package. The Standard Hits are re-records from the K-Tel / Dominion Catalogue. For more information on the entire Chubby Checker story go to: [...] (NOTHING is being sold on my site, it is just the complete Chubby Checker information spot)."
5,They saved the best for last,"Sadly, this is the last Beautiful South album, but it's also their best. The songwriting, playing and vocals have never been better. Alison Wheeler's parts are especially excellent. This album just never gets old."
2,Disappointed,"I wish they had just made a simple fife instead of trying to ""improve"" it. The extra fingerholes were badly placed (at least for my big hands) making it almost unplayable. This is too bad because everything else was so well designed for a cheap plastic pipe. It's been sitting in it's bag for a while now, maybe I will find someone with small hands to give it to..."
2,Not a fife,"If Yamaha had named this something other than a 'fife', I would have no problem with it. But because the fingerings are considerably different than a fife, it is of no help to anyone wishing to learn to play a fife.Call it a 'Flufe' or a 'Recorfe' or anything else Yamaha, but when you call something a 'fife' there is an expectation that it's actually a fife."
5,OUTSTANDING READ!!!,"""Beware of Aliens"" is an excellent depiction of good versus evil. Dr. Jerry Holmes takes the reader on a spiritual journey through life pointing out the vices of the enemy as he plagues our society. ""Beware of Aliens"" equips Christians to fight the spiritual war that is ever present and at hand. If you are wrestling against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places, then you NEED this book."
4,Good reading,I bought this book because I enjoy David Drake not knowing it was actually several authors. I found the book a pretty fun read because of that.
3,A Haynes is no Chilton's.,"This Haynes manual suffers from the perennial lack of information. It was purchased due to lack of availability of a proper shop manual. I paid for an inferior manual with my time and frustration but the price I paid for the manual was worth the type of manual received. If you purchase this manual, be prepared to go to web sites and threads to get answers for all of the annoying difficulties which only surface on vehicles with many miles and after many years of driving (and many owners). I knew what I was buying but hoped for the best. For most maintenance, this manual is adequate. With electronic sensors, EGR and EVAP controls, and the non-specific codes Ford has used in older pick-ups, my fix(es) were difficult. In fairness to Haynes, they were electrical in nature and, by definition, difficult ""find and then fix"" difficulties that send many old vehicles to the junk yard."
3,It's ok but no EEC-IV onboard computer info,I purchased this manual for a 1992 Ford Ranger Pickup that has the check engine light come on. The manual has no info on the EEC-IV onboard fault codes. The check engine light is not even found in the index. The manual was printed in 1993.
5,I Bought a Bunch!,"I was at one time several years ago in a Secular Franciscan Order. God caused a miracle in the mountains of Mescalero, New Mexico that is bearing good fruit to this day. I believe they still use this book in their formation. It is a marvelous book written by a man of God who is also one of God's holy, Catholic priests. It is clear by the content and the words chosen to express it that he lived by the words he has penned. These words are those of one who has striven to live a life intent on imitating that of the Master Who was both God and man. To live up to that calling is one that can only be accomplished by God's unmerited favor, aka, Grace. Living a prayerful life, one that relies on God for everything is the only way. His Way makes this clear by what is said, how it is said, and what is not said."
3,"Works, but phone end plugs break easily","All of the cables in the set work for me, but there is an unpleasant fault: unlike the originalLG equipment that made solidly molded at the phone plug housing, this set uses two smallside covers held together with tiny latches, and those are very brittle and break off easily.So be prepared to have to use a wrap or two of the electric tape around them rather soon."
2,fuse blew,"I bought this product mainly for the car charger that came with it and i plugged it in and after 5 min of charging the fuse blew. And the other chargers ""work"" but when my phone is charging with them i cant use my phone. it wont let me type od use the backspace button."
3,Questionable value?,"I got this pack of chargers; the wall charger went into the wall, and the second time it came out of the wall one of the tongs stayed in the wall electrical outlet.We do get what we pay for... less than expensive also means less than great quality."
1,Look elsewhere,"Not recomended. The USB cable 'driver' disk is actually just a bunch of html links to the manufacturer's website - no drivers, no synch software, just a bunch of cryptic, outdated links. Good luck installing anything.The rest of the package is low quality electronics. At least they work, so far."
1,what you pay is what you get.,"So I bought this product for my brother. It just got delivered. At first, the car charger didn't work, then after a while it decided to. Plus, the metal piece broke off while attached to the phone, luckily I was able to pry it out with tweezers... What you pay is what you get with this. Cheap. Haven't even tried the other chargers, worried those will break off in the phone too."
1,Horrible and Worthless,"this product was garbage, literally. the very FIRST TIME i plugged the phone charger onto my cell phone, it seemed alright. then i plugged the charger into an outlet. didn't work. i thought i plugged it wrong so when i tried to remove the the charger from my cell, it FREAKING BROKE! The metal end where the cell phone and charger connect was removed and got stuck in my cellphone. the worst product i have ever had. Literally 10 SECONDS! into use and it broke.The USB is also useless. it doesn't work for my VX8600, when it says it does. It's a lie. Will never buy from this manufacturer again.THIS IS WHAT I GET FOR BEING FRUGAL. LESSON LEARNED!"
2,+ve & -VE,"I received the package promptly and the pricing is VERY competitive. However, the CD with USB driver for connecting the phone to the computer through USB cable provided in the package does not work. When I connect the phone through USB cable, it asked for drivers and I inserted the CD. However, CD does not seem to have the right driver. The computer repeatedly comes to the popup window for installing driver. I had to disconnect the cable and phone to stop it from coming again and again. PLEASE HELP ! Please send me the right Windows XP driver for the cable/phone. I am using this with LG Vx8550."
4,Everything worked as advertised,"I'm completely satisfied. I ordered this package for the usb data cable, but I got a car charger and a spare charger for work. Bonus. The kit also comes with a disk with all the drivers you need to synch your phone with your PC. I am using Bitpim (free download). At this price if only two of the products worked you still save money. Product arrived quickly. BTW, you'll want to order more memory because it's so easy to upload music."
4,LG Connectivity,"Purchased the home/car/USB cables for my LG phone - they are exactly what I expected, work fine, and the price was a real steal - considered that previously the USB data cable was only available in the verizon music service bundle for $30.00. Even with exorbitant S&H charges, the cost was less than 1/2 of any of the items alone at a cell store."
3,Good for the price,"About what I expected for the price and after reading the other reviews. I felt it was worth the risk to try it, since this price was less than buying any one of them separately at full retail. So far, everything works. As noted elsewhere, the CD contains the USB driver for the cable only, which worked for me, on an older Dell Inspiron, XP home. Downloaded and using BitPim for phone interface GUI."
2,Gladiator rehash,"A good story with fine actors. However, Scott should have gone with a different actor than Russell Crowe. Besides the obvious questions of how does a peasant foot soldier learn to ride so well, and how does he become a great tactician, as soon as he gets on a horse, you expect him to draw his gladius and start yelling ""single column!""."
2,This film falls real short of expectations,"I thought i was going to see an epic film, but this fell really short of expectations. Poor acting in places and honestly, it could have been better. Despite notoriously good directors, I feel this was produced and directed poorly. Epic failure with sporadic scenes of interest and entertainment."
2,Robin Bland,"Rarely has such a potentially exciting and adventurous figure as Robin Hood been rendered so bland and listless as he has in this film version of the noble bandit. Russell Crowe seems lost, Cate Blanchett is far too classy for this film, and Max von Sydow phones in his performance. Although I'm usually a fan of Ridley Scott's work, this one is just an unfortunate misfire--I wonder whether he has forgotten how to tell a story. The numerous villains in this story are poorly developed (as are just about all of the supporting characters), the plot--which wanders aimlessly--is unnecessarily complicated by irrelevant subplots and revisions to the standard Robin Hood tale, and the whole thing devolves into a boring, pathetic mess. Perhaps Scott and screenwriter Brian Helgeland were hoping to breathe new life into this classic tale, but they ultimately sucked the last vestige of vitality right out of it."
4,Good movie,"Worth watching, good acting, and a nice twist...many of the great people and events of history were influenced by chance and how they reacted is what made them the heroes or the duds that we know today. No one knows for sure how or if these things went down and this is a nice version. At least some form of the idea of freedom was rattling around at that time, for the gentry anyway, ala the Magna Carta, so the ""freedom contract"" isn't that far fetched in this movie. Give it a try."
3,"Long, slow, hard to follow, but pretty good movie","I watched this via Amazon instant Video on my PS3. I have a 25mbps Cable internet connection yet the movie was very choppy and laggy. I paid for the HD version yet was forced to watch the regular version. Not a big deal. Maybe just cable internet was bogged down, but Netflix was working just fine at the same time, so not sure what to think.Either way, the movie was a bit slow at times and hard to follow. It seemed like the movie relied on your prior knowledge of the characters and who they are to really appreciate what the movie was trying to do at times. My Girlfriend had to explain characters and who they were in order to make it all come together. I started falling asleep after about 1:45 in, so I can't rate how it finished. I can tell you that it's nothing like Gladiator as one of the reviews stated. lol"
3,A little disappointing,This movie had a lot of new additions to the story which seemed to be more of a set up for a part 2 rather than a complete story...
2,Did not like it,I did not like this movie I thought plot was dumb I did not like how king Richard Died nor did I like prince John roll as being an spoiled child
3,OK for Crowe fans...,"Reminds me of Jaws...first half of film feels long, complicated and despite gory battle scenes that were not meaningful, boring. In the second half, the movie gets down to the story and I enjoyed it. When will directors be more interested in STORY than in how much they can throw to the FX group?"
2,Boring!!!,"Trying to be original in the absence of originality. A far fetched story that drags on. Too bad Russell Crowe wastes his talent on junk like this--any further analysis of the movie would be a waste of my time. If the story is empty it should at least be entertaining. However, since I have seen worse movies than this one, I am giving it two stars."
2,Robin Hood (Two-Disc Unrated Director's Cut),"It is a movie with Russell Crowe, not his finest and it doe's bend the legend of Robin Hood"
2,Snoozefest,"While this may be a brilliant historical retrospective, it's an undeniable borefest.But, if you are into Renaissance fairs, this might be right up your cobble stoned alley."
3,Robin Hood?,"This movie is entertaining but it is not one of Crowe's best and the film itself is a poor man's ""Gladiator."" I had to laugh when the French forces landed in thinly desguised Higgins WW II landing craft. All and all it is a decent film. Slow in spots (to a dead crawl), but if you are a Russel Crowe fan like me you have to add it to your collection. Personally ""LA Confidential"" was much more enjoyable."
2,Avery mediocre movie,"Boring in parts. Souldn't have been since the subject matter is so excellent. The sequel is sure to be better since they will finally have made it to Sherwood Forest. When this gets down to a dollar, I might buy it."
2,Boring movie,"Robin Hood was just too dull, in my opinion. I appreciated the drab colors and decor but could not get into the movie. The acting all seemed fake and the story was too convoluted."
3,"Just ok, never gripped me..interesting take on Robin Hood","It is an interesting take on the romantic story of Robin Hood, and from that perspective I can enjoy the variety and greater realism, but unfortunately I never felt the characters jump out of the picture and pull me in. Russel Crowe looked stiff to me, as if he did not embrace the role with anything more than I am here. I do demand more character development and participation from movies that I like. I guess Russell Crowe did not seem believable, and there was no chemistry between the two main characters from my perspective. Not a horrible movie, but I guess just ok."
5,Director's cut is so much better!!,"Just saw the DVD,now Ridley finally got the story completed!!(especially the relationship between Marion/Robin and Marion/Wild children)It became more logical and real...has more emotions on the storyboard.Overall it's much better than theatrical version...I was wondering why Universal could not release the director's cut at the first place?Maybe the boxoffice will be higher than 300 millions!!Pity."
3,Monotonous and scattered,"I'm a huge fan of Russell Crowe, Ridley Scott, and this genre in most instances. When this movie came out, I knew I had to watch it! To my dissappointment, the movie felt as though it dragged on and on without a singular purpose. Other reviews have mentioned it and I completely agree that it is boring, not purely for the lack of action, but also for the lack of character development and a clear vision."
3,Not for true beginners,"I bought this recently and have done the routine about 3 times. I think it is a great ""workout"", however it is not for true step beginners. I find the step combos to be a little complex for the small amount of time she explains/shows them.I didn't find her to be that relatable, but I did like that she used her actual students in the video.I would have given this a 4 if it were better titled, or offered an actual beginner work out.I think this is a good choice for advanced beginners."
1,Broken bottle!!!!,"I love this hair gel so I decided to buy two of them at one time. When I got them, they both came wrapped in plastic but one of them came wrapped in an extra plastic, I didn't understand? The last time I bought this it wasn't packaged like this. When I opened it up I realized why. The dispenser was broken and they didn't want the gel to get everywhere (which it was, in the bag). I was disappointed that they knew it was broken and still shipped it to me."
1,Baby gel,This gel does not hold at all even when I keep re-applying. The jenerations baby gel is much better.
4,Great for Toddlers,"I love this hair gel for my 20 month old son. It doesn't leave his hair gummy and it doesn't flake up like most products do. I only wish is cost a bit less, but I'm willing to pay the price for my sons gorgeous curls."
2,a bit violent,I know there is going to be some violence when it comes to dinosaurs but this is a cartoon. I was surprised when my daughters said they wouldn't watch the rest of the movie and told me to give it away. It freaked them out to say the least. We will stick with the PBS series Dinosaur Train.
3,Not what I expected from someone who just made Jurassic Park,"A lifelong dinosaur lover, I picked up a kid's paperback book all about a happy-go-lucky Tyrannosaurus Rex and his buddies who were suddenly sent out on a wacky adventure in the modern-time New York City by an alien who looks just like a dinosaur himself. Then Steven Speilberg, the film wizard took this little story and changed it all, including leaving out some of the dinosaur characters and tossing in a couple of cutesy little human waifs. Now the dinosaurs (and the humans as well) look just like very grotesque cartoon characters that may make your stomach churl a little. In addition, this animated kiddie wish-granter is also saturated with a really bizarre fantasy involving the big freak show that some odd-looking villain set up in the Central Park. Oh, well - I think ""American Tail"" and ""Land Before Time"" are much better works of animation by Steven Speilberg and Don Bluth, one of our own kartoon geniuses."
3,Jurassic Park for the kiddies,"Satisfactory adaption of Spielberg's interest in dinoland, but this time the dinosaurs are not confined to an island zoo. Instead, they time travel to the heart of New York, just in time for Thanksgiving, and secretly hiding among the huge floats and balloons.Enter two lovable children who befriend the dinosaurs and stumble into the evil clutches of Professor Sreweyes Eccentric Circus located in Central Park. The dinosaurs come to the rescue!Not a ""Disney classic"" type film, but it is cute fun and didn't lose my interest. Although the last half may be dark and gloomier than the first part, it doesn't seem to me to be any more traumatic than the real Disney villians true nature or force.Although some big names are voiced here in bit parts, I can see where it may have some inside jokes from producers for casting Jay Leno or Julia Child. After all, the tale does take place during Thanksgiving holiday, and having Julia is like having a real chef in the house. (Ha,ha)."
2,Nah...,Didn't like it. Re-sold it on eBay. I'm avidly interested in sock monkies and their history but this added nothing to my knowledge or enjoyment Don't waste your money.
4,Eval on product,"I liked the book, but the way that it is presented is hard to grasp sometimes. Otherwise the book is a good source of facts."
4,"well written, not cheaply done",i bought several of these type books but ended up throwing them all away except for this one. the writer is good. the story is good.
3,Not as good as remembered,"I bought this pink Foogo to replace a lost blue and yellow one that I previously owned. The blue one was fantastic. Never had a problem with it in the years that I owned it. However, this pink one was awful. The first thing I noticed was that the top seemed to be different. It was a shiny and had a cheap-plastic feel to it. And when I opened the thing up, it would spill drink. It was almost like the contents became pressurized...or maybe it was the way the straw was configured. I'm not sure what, but it was messy to deal with, especially when filled with colored beverages like Koolaid and the such. On a couple of occasions it also leaked. I don't carry carbonated beverages in these things, and the drinks I pour in are the same that I used with the other Foogoo, but it never leaked and this one does. I'm just not at all happy with the look or feel of this thermos and will be purchasing another one to go in my lunch set."
4,"Great alternative to plastic cups, but....","I bought two of these for my kids and really like them. Beverages stay cold for hours and they do not sweat or leak. However if your child is a chewer, that straw will not last long at all! My oldest chewed the straw immediately and of course now it has a nice slice of a hole in it. I'm going to see about ordeing a replacement part, but it will probably not be cheap.I'd go w/ the Sigg cups if you are shopping around. They work just as well and you don't have to worry about soft plastic parts! We have serveral of these, as every member of our family uses one."
4,Sunrise of a Rockabilly Rebel,Jimmy Ellis known as ORION had a great voice and a talent that was often overlooked due to the fact he had the same type of voice as Elvis Presley. Ellis (Orion) gives some of his best to the songs on this CD. If you like Rock & Roll you are sure to like ORION the Rockabilly Rebel.
5,"Great sex, even better story.","If you're into M/F erotica with the male on top this is the book for you. Unlike all the other Black Lace books I've read the female lead doesn't have at it with every person she meets. Genevieve is a lady, not some alley cat, but boy oh boy does she purr for her master! Except for one F/F scene (arranged by her master so he can watch) every spot of sex is between the master and his slave. That's what makes this book so good, so intense, so romantic and so bloody sexy. It smacks of reality in this day of safe sex.I want to thank the author for doing the master/slave storyline with a master who is not into torture, cruelty or mutilation. Bravo!I agree with another reviewer, out the all the Black Lace books I've read this is one of the best."
4,"It floats, is streamlined, but nicks easily.","This item garners the same complaint that I have with the Aqua Sphere pull buoy: it floats, is functional, but nicks/gouges very easily. I try to keep this away from the sharper objects in my swim gear bag (snorkel, fins), but it still gets dented, nicked, scratched, and gouged. Regardless, it works quite well and I really like the smooth underside, the ribbed handholds, and the ample crescent at the base (perfect for kicking with my head down into the water). One of the best parts is that it isn't as small as a kid's kickboard, but it's not huge, either. Really good product overall."
3,aqua sphere kick board blue,"This board feels very flimsy, I have only used it a few times so I can't comment on the long term durability. In the water it seems to bend easily and to me it is slippery when wet. I do like the shape of the board, if it were only a little more rigid. I feel that this board would be better suited to a child even though the product description does not say it is for a youth. I gave it three stars because it was an inexpensive board and you get what you pay for; but for my use as an adult it would be a one star product."
4,Fantastic!,"I found some of the tracks rather odd what with the techno sounding background sometimes, but what the heck, it's still a great recording. The Po Kare Kare Ana is amazing. The Maori group that sang with Dame Kiri is also very good, especially the men. I adore these folk songs....great for blasting in your bedroom."
3,Good Ideas ...,"Good ideas for signs in front of churches. Some ideas better than others. Worth the price of purchase, although I'm not certain I would buy the many other versions of the ""sentence sermon"" books.Somewhat simplistic and ""pat"" at times, although they are attention-getters."
1,Waiting and Waiting!,"I have ordered this product in November of 2010, when it was still in stock but im still waiting. I heard good things about this anime but am very dissapointed in the service."
4,Classic,"I'm a pretty big anime fan, and for some reason S-Cry-ed has always had a special place in my heart for me. It was one of the first series I watched. As far as storyline and etc., it's a pretty common super-power anime. Main character has a power, so do lots of other people. He must get stronger to defeat the bag guys. There are a few twists, but nothing too outrageous."
4,Great stuff,"My first encounter with Knight and Lomas. I must admit that they wrote very well and clear and it is not hard to understand their arguments.Their conclusions about the megalithic yardis amazing indeed. However, I struggle to understand how they can look with naked eyes using the megaliths to predict any future impact. Well, let me put it this way, is the machine accurate enough to help in such prediction? I can accept the fact that the machine is accurate enough to predict equinoxes, soltices or even eclipses. To predict impact of comet and Earth might be a bot too far fletching.Other than that, it is a very good read, not difficutl at all for non mathematicians! Great stuff!"
1,waste of my time,"I read a lot and a wide variety of books. This book was a waste of my time as far as new ideas. I hate to start a book and not finish it. I came close to not finishing this book, but did finish."
4,The Celtic Church a Secret Sect of Enochian Jews!,"If you like fantanstic claims like that, Uriel's Machine is the book for you.Entertaining and thought provoking but a little prosaic for my tastes. Too many exclamantion points for starters (!!). Still, a good book for the irreverant, the gulible and the plain curious."
2,Are these the right songs?,"I picked this up as the Amazon digital deal of the day. So for $1.99 I can't complain too much. The sound quality is relatively good, however my biggest gripe is that the song titles seem to be wrong. I'm not an expert on the Big Band Era, and maybe songs were known by different names, however several of the songs are easily recognizable standards, that appear to have the wrong name: Track 5 is listed as ""See Saw"", but is clearly ""I'm In The Mood For Love"". Track 6 is listed as ""Nevertheless"", but is actually ""Sweet Georgia Brown"". Track 12 is listed as ""Body And Soul"", but is ""Embraceable You"". Track 13 is the most blatant: being listed as ""A Little Bird Told Me"", but being the song (and lyrics) ""Blue Skies"". So on the whole I doubt I have the right names on any of the songs. Is this the correct content?"
2,too much drama!,"Sanjay leela bansali has taken over his success on to his head....he has crossed that thin red line which differentiates great cinema with horrible one. he has taken for granted to dramatise so much that everything looks here like a fantasy land with all the modern ingredients of daily life.its convenient Cinema for the director. The whole film is a like art painting. if you cut down any scene to a single frame, it looks like a peice of Art.well, certainly not impressive at all."
2,A little too tough to decipher...,"This is the second such book I have bought on the subject of Face Reading. The illustrations were difficult to follow and it's tough for the reader to develop a ""user friendly"" guide after completion. Rather, I suggest that you try ""The Naked Face"" by Young, which was far easier to interpret. Sure, if one were a practioner for 2 decades, then they could decipher the illustrations, but the learning curve was rather steep. Give the other book a glance, that's my opinion."
2,Interesting but unimpressive.,"Nothing new here and I don't think there is any substantial research to back up the concept. It is mostly wishful thinking, creative fiction and hokem. Pretty much a waste of time."
5,before the rot set in,"I can't believe the bozo's that gave these albums three stars. There's no accounting for taste !These albums are the best the Babys ever did. As a matter of fact, i didn't buy another babys album after these because everything i heard from here on in was downhill.Get these two , and then John Waite's ""No Brakes"" . You'll hear the best from these guys , before big business took over, and the rot set in !"
1,Whine Lover,"It's always sad when someone uses their notoriety to market abook no matter how poorly written. For some reason, they usually trytheir hand at children's books with deplorable results and always with the same effect. 1. They lead people who don't know to children's literature to think this is what children's literature should be, 2. They shut out good writers, and 3. They take up valuable shelf space.This noxious little book is just what one might expect from that world-class whiner and the amateurish illustrations are right in keeping with the text."
1,I wouldn't waaannt to read this to a child,"Dr. Laura's newest children's book sends a terribly mixed message to children and parents. When Sammy's mother takes him shopping for a birthday present for another child, he throws a temper tantrum in the store because he wants everything he sees. Instead of taking him out of the store, his mother goes ahead and actually buys all the toys for him, hoping that he will come to the conclusion that having everything won't make him happy after all. While Sammy may realize that things don't make him happy, he also has found a way to get what he wants. I can't help but wonder which lesson the child hearing this story will actually come away with."
1,Superficial with nice illustrations,"The moral of the story: get a good illustrator to illustrate a book whose story is weak at best and try to make some money off of the author's celebrity. Bleagh. Laura Schlessinger's superficial story goes like this: baby cries and whines for different cool new things (""I Want It""), and the parent relents and buys them all. The point is *supposed* to be, Gosh, if you have everything you ask for, do you feel fulfilled? But, geez, Dr. Laura, way to write a story that misses your own point. I read this aloud to my six-year-old. She didn't get it--she though the point was, See, you should just buy me everything I want. OK, so maybe my kid may not be the smartest kid (I like to think she is, though), but you better hope your kid has graduate-level critical thinking skills to understand what Dr. Laura's message is. I was utterly disappointed and troubled!"
2,It Identified Me Flat Out,This book is the ultimate in spiritual guidance! I could not overcome how powerful the message in this book was! Joyce Myer is a wonderful author with a gift from God. This book tells everything you could possibly wanna know about dealing with temptation and resisting your innerself. I reccomend this book to christians and nonchristians alike! It is a great book for improving the negative self-image we have of ourselves! I am looking forward to future books by Joyce Myer.
3,not the gospel but good for your mind; not an audio book,"I read the book and it really helped me to recognize the demons that were invading my mind and to use the Armor of God against them. Granted Joyce Meyer's understanding of some of the scriptures is not sound but like with anything you read, you have to use discernment. Disregard the falsities and learn from what is good and right. I would not suggest a person who is new to Bible study read it; it would greatly mislead them. I liked the book so much that I bought the audio version so I could listen in the car. But it is not an audio book. It is 4 discs of Joyce preaching. It is not advertised as such."
2,Not read by the author,"I have listened to many Joyce Meyers CD's and love them, mostly because she is the voice you hear when listening to her CD's. Joyce puts her emotions and energy into the CD which gives it a bigger impact. The voice of the reader on this CD is very monotone and I didn't get the impact that I usually do when listening to a CD that Joyce reads herself."
1,Reckless drivel,"MISHANDLING GOD'S WORD.Reckless drivel.Inaccurate Biblical interpretation is deadly, ETERNALLY.Try Dr. John Macarthur and John Piper for life changing, inspirational and God honoring Biblical TRUTHS."
3,Battlefield review,The book arrived very promptly and in great shape... Looked like new other than a slight bend in the corner which is no big deal. The only reason I gave this 3 stars is because it was a 1995 edition and not the updated version that was pictured. It is an excellent book by Joyce detailing why our thought life is crucial to our Christian walk and she portrays in easy to understand way the battle that is always in play and how we gain victory! Every Christian male and female should read this book and learn from the insights Joyce has shared.
3,Joyce Meyer book,Easy to understand and enjoyable Joyce Meyer books are easy to understand and I'm able to read and retain her teaching even if I don't spend alot of time in the book daily
5,This book has changed my life,Desperate? Feel like there is no hope for you? This book will change your life like it did mine. BUY this book and read it just once and you will be changed forever. Read it over and over as a daily routine and you will be happy forever. This book has changed my life.
5,Powerful!,"This book is one of the most powerful, life-changing books that I have ever read. I am ""dissecting"" it now for the second time this month to make sure that I didn't miss anything. My attitudes, moods and thoughts have changed dramatically. I've begun to think about what I'm thinking about and I'm not allowing Satan to use my brain for his playground. The great part about it is that it is also changing my husband, and two teenage sons, and they haven't even read it! Obviously it is my thoughts towards them and our circumstances that are changing and now our life together is much more peaceful and stress free! Thank you Joyce. I was working on a study format in order to teach this to the teenagers at church. I'm glad to see that the study guide will be coming out in June. I'll be waiting."
5,Great book on the international problem of genrfication!,Rebecca Solnit's prose is beautiful and Susan Schwartzenberg's photos are visionary as well. Thought provoking. I recommend this book as well as Gary Brechin's Imperial San Francisco and the classic by Jane Jacobs on cities as required reading for urban residents!
2,Shallow City: History of Its Flux from Origins to Eternity,"The historical journey Solnit takes through the reoccurring demise of San Francisco's bohemian culture only leads to sob stories in the end and does little for her cause. Remember, these now run-down neighborhoods and homes were expensive and new when first built 100 years ago. Yes, it's horrible that in our time the materially rich are pushing the spiritually rich out of the city, but the book only shows that artists will one day come back again. It may not be the same as when we first came, but that's life - nothing stays the same."
1,HOLLOW BOOK,"THIS SNAPSHOT HAS ALREADY FADED. THERE IS NO ANALYSIS OF GATHERED INFORMATION HERE - RATHER SKEWED JOURNALISM WITH AN AGENDA. IT IS A POOR REPRESENTATION OF THE COMPLEX GENTRIFICATION ISSUE AND I AM DISAPPOINTED.THE PHOTOGRAPHY IS MEDIOCRE.THIS SHOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN A BOOK - PERHAPS A SECTION IN THE SUNDAY PAPER NEXT TO AN ARTICLE THAT ACTUALLY INVESTIGATES THE ISSUE.I AM A CONCERNED SAN FRACISCAN, A SUSTAINABLY MINDED ARCHITECT, AND AM DISMAYED BY THIS TERSE ACCOUNT. WHAT A WASTE. I USUALLY NEVER WRITE REVIEWS BUT I WAS HONESTLY LET DOWN BY THIS BOOK AND FEEL COMPELED TO SAY SOMETHING."
2,4711 Muelhens,"I gave this product to a friend. She said it had weaker fragrance than she remembered it to have. The price, however, is very reasonable."
5,bsst there is for my taste,"I have always loved this original cologne. It has a delightful aroma, is not too sweet, lingers some but not forever. I really like it."
5,Proud to Support The Cause,My daughter is a Type 1 diabetic and I'm PROUD to display this magnet. I actually ordered 2. One for myself and one for a friend who also has a Type 1 diabetic daughter. The processing and shipping time was really quick and the magnets look perfect!! ANYTHING TO SUPPORT THE CAUSE!!
5,Great improvement,A much more user-friendly layout and presentation than was the case with the last edition I bought 20 years ago.
2,dissapointing,"Like many others I was really dissapointed in this album. Being a huge fan of earlier works like Old Ground, Big Dog, The Factory, and Live at Palace Theatre...not to mention getting to see them live, I was anxious to pick this up. Everything that was fun and exciting about 7N was gone. What remains isnt horrible, they just sound like every other pop-rock goup out there. Makes you wonder why the piper and fiddler stay with them if they arent going to be used. Your time and money is better spent listening to their earlier stuff or getting an earful of the Wicked Tinkers or something."
2,Not typical 7n material,"I saw this band live, and ordered this CD online two days later. I was bitterly disappointed. There isn't anything wrong with the CD, but it isn't the typical 7 nations sound. It sounds very mainstream and ordinary. If you are looking for the celtic flair, try another disc."
2,CLICHE,"Ok, the truth is that this album is not really Seven Nations. I mean, it says it on the album, but it is inferior to all of their other offerings. I like it when Seven Nations blends some pop offerings into their music...but on this album the entire list is just pop. CLICHE!!! Seven Nations used to be my favorite band. What they need to do now is go back to making music for themselves rather than to sell records to mainstream America, which, I must say, has arguably the worst taste in music. If you want real Seven Nations, buy every one of their other albums first, especially BIG DOG. Even at their last concert, the just didn't really seem to enjoy playing their songs as much as they used to. This album as well as this band's current trends are very disappointing."
2,"A silly book- go and read ""Man Who Fell to Earth"" instead","I had high hopes for this book due to the glowing amazon reviews. Also I'd read and greatly enjoyed Tevis' earlier novel, ""The Man Who Fell to Earth"", which is indeed a classic.However, I just found the premise (of near-future illiteracy) and story too silly to enjoy. It's a ""love-story"" of sorts: boy love girl but later we learn it's a one-sided affair (after he's sent to prison). Later, he escapes from jail and after a long and arduous journey gets back to the girl- then she suddenly falls for him because he's now a real he-man (all tanned and buffed)! Give me a break....oh yeah, and then the robot takes a flying leap.Seriously, Mockingbird was old-fashioned the day it was published and like ""Fahrenheit 451"", it's not aged well at all."
4,Hikari 00197,Great for the price. Just like you would get anywhere else. Very bright and great quality product. I usally by American Made but this product is very good. I would by from this company again.
1,Um..it was horrible. The subtitles were terrible.,"I'm not sure about the film some of these other reviewers saw, but I could not stand this movie. For one thing - one very critical thing - it's got some of the most UNREADABLE subtitles ever! Which, I'm sure, added to my complete lack of enjoyment. I'm an Independent Film fan and I was looking forward to seeing this movie but it's disconnected and at times, just unwatchable. The story meanders and the lighting isn't so great either. I was very disappointed. Be careful if you're planning on purchasing this DVD. Try to rent it first - check the foreign section of your favorite video store. Best Regards, turtlex"
1,30 Minutes ...,"... of pretentious, self-absorbed, humourless, androgynous Parisians is all i can take. if you're more patient than i, maybe you'll discover it gets better."
5,Most wonderful drill I've had,"This is the most wonderful drill I've every had. It is cordless and the Lithium-Ion batteries charge up quickly and last a decent amount of time. It has a nice direct drive to it, starting and stopping quickly. Although it can be used as a power screwdriver it is better as a drill due to it's weight."
2,Good modem,I like this modem. It's easy to use and easy to install.The problem was that I did get a broken modem. So I had to return this item to Amazon.I loved the Amazon's return process. It's easy and fast...Thanks.
4,Looking for a good modem at lower price,This cable modem is really very good and it is working fine per my expectations. I like the stability of this Modem.
5,Motorola SURFboard SB5120 - Cable modem - external - Hi-Speed USB / Fast Ethernet - 38 Mbps,Works great. Easy to set up just plug it in and get fast internet surfing. The modem my isp rented to me wouldn't stand up right but this one is small and sturdy. No problems at all from it.
4,Remember the MAC ID,"I had no trouble installing this once I called the cable company and gave them the MAC ID. Doing this first would have saved a lot of time. Since then, the product has performed 100% better than the modem I had rented from the cable co."
5,Reliable and stable product,"I bought this little thing 4 months ago to replace a rental modem from Comcast, saving $3 a month for a good burger. The modem is stable as it is supposed to be, no quality issues so far. I would recommend it to you if you are also considering replacing a COMCAST modem. Other than that, no further comments as I am still observing its performance."
1,modem that would not work,"Perhaps it has nothing to do with the modem or the manufacturer, and something to do with my cable service from Comcast, but the modem just did not work. All the lights were blinking, but the modem would not connect to the Internet, so I had to return it and that is the only experience I can share."
3,Travelogue Yes; Buddhism No,"If you're interested in a travelogue about a woman traveling in central Asia, this will serve you quite well. But if you're interested in learning about Buddhism it offers very little. There was nothing in the book that indicated the author was Buddhist, nor had any sort of Buddhist perspective.The book is primarily about Mishi Saran, not Xuanzang, and I note with interest that the two previous reviewers both misspelled his name the same way.Bottom line: It's a 4 or 5 star travelogue about a journey through lands that were formerly Buddhist; it's a 2 star description of the travels of Xuanzang."
4,a good memoir written on a tough subject,I really got into this memoir--when I wasn't really sure what I was going to be getting into..except to say it was about her father's decent into Alzheimer's Disease.
4,A most amazing woman...,"This book details the life of Jesusita Aragon, a woman who has ushered more than 15,000 babies into this world. From her childhood in rural northern New Mexico to her career as the region's most highly respected midwife, one learns of the trials and tribulations endured duing a pivotal period in the American Southwest's progression from traditional Hispanic life into the modern times. As a piece of anthropological history, and as a human story, this book documents a reality little known to most people. Written from a first-hand observation and involvement, Fran Buss has captured the day-to-day feeling of the life that this most amazing woman lead. I was fortunate enough to have had her deliver both of my children, and I can attest to the accuracy and sincerity of this book. I recommend it highly to anyone interested in home birth or Southwestern U.S. history."
3,Great MCAT Prep Book,"This book definitely helps when preparing for the MCAT. Good indication of what the actual ""MCAT"" is all about. My friend recommended, and I'm glad I listened to her advice."
1,An unhappy surprise,"There is nothing in the write-up on amazon, nor on the album except for a brief one-sentence note in the liner notes, to say that this is a translation of the Middle English. And it is a translation. How good, I don't know, but it was certainly not what I thought I was getting. I maylisten to it eventually. I may even enjoy it. But, at the moment, Iam greatly disappointed."
5,Great Refresher!,"I've taken accounting classes when I went to school to get my Associate's degree, it's been a few years since I've studied it. I really needed something to refresh my brain and prepare me for learning in the field of accounting, since I will be returning to college this fall for my bachelors in accounting. This book really did just that, and it was in such an easy format! I finished it in two days, and I feel that I learned more than I think I did in school 4 years ago! It helped me understand inventory and depreciation better than I ever had. I highly recommend this book for anyone planning to open a small business, or if you're planning on returning to school in this field, it's a wonderful refresher course!"
3,It's worth a look...,"UPDATE: The more I repair/fixup my 90 Accord, the more useless this book has become. I have found ever MORE mistakes within the pages of this book. This is good to have around for quick reference, but if you want something with detail and spot on accuracy, get the 1984-1995 Accord/Prelude Chilton manual instead, it's what I've been using for the past two years.This book is great for general knowledge, but if your like me I like to know my car in and out. This book doesn't have many details and I've found several mistakes in it. For once I would recommend the 1984-1995 Accord/Perlude Chilton repair manual. It might seem like they are covering a large area (12 years of Accords and Preludes), but they go into great detail for each model and year."
2,How to Paint with Wax? Hardly.,"Well, it's my own fault. I read the other reviews here and still bought the book. I was disappointed with the content (which wasn't very helpful for a novice) the artwork in the book, as well as the SIZE of the book. If you want to learn how to do Encaustic painting - you won't learn it here. All the author tells you is that you melt some wax on an iron and spread it around. He doesn't even touch on the other forms of Encaustic painting, such as using a ""crock pot"" and a brush - just as one example."
1,Encaustic ART? That's a stretch,"If you want to learn a CRAFT to wow your friends, neighbors and the folks at the local crafts fair, this is the book for you. If, however, you're looking to create fine art through encaustic painting, save your money."
5,Flying Black Ponies,Having Flown onces to photograph the Black Ponies In VN I was very interested in their story. It was well donre and interesting I read cover to cover in 2 days.
2,Cheaply made plastic rice cooker.,"I bought this not expecting great quality, but I hoped for at least good. The latch that locks the lid broke within the first week. I was able to get a new one, but I wish I had gotten a better quality one because we make rice a lot. Next time I will spend more to get a better quality product."
2,Make crunchy rice!!!!!!,This is great if you like crunchy rice.I followed the instructions to the T and the rice came out crunchy and uncooked.....terrible.Sooooo....I had to experiment.......it says 1 1/2 cups of water to 1 cup of rice......I actually NEEDED to use 2 - 1 ratio.It says to micro at half power for 11 minutes.......WRONG!!!!I had to micro at full for about 16 minutes to make edible rice.Perhaps I'll need a new microwave next!!!!!!!
4,Handy to have,"When I bought my little 1010 micro case for some photography accessories I joked and said that it should have mini pluck-foam. I was thrilled when I found you could get it (yes, I'm easily amused) so ordered right away.While not as easy to use as the full size Pelican Pluck Foam, it still works well. I had to use manicure scissors to get it to come out correctly, but now I have a custom fit case for my accessories to be tucked away safely."
5,Great supporting agent,"I use a variety of Micro-cases, for some cameras I use on the water and in the swamp during photo shoots...great protection...the pick and pluck adds to that protection. Can custom fit any product to insure no jarring or scratching when traveling."
2,"Not quite like ""Silk"" - too rough for facial cleaning.","I have been looking for a nice soft facial sponge for cleansing. The word silk is a complete misrepresentation as this is a very stiff rigid sponge, not very soft for facial cleansing.I will keep them for my art projects, very disappointed.I am still searching for a nice soft facial sponge!"
5,Brillant DVD for a timeless masterpiece...OOP?!,"Oh, no! Why OOP again? This is a must for one who loves comedies and one who loves great DVDs. CRITERION has done their best on this and now...leave it to memories."
5,Mom and Dad will sing along,"My parents bought this cd for my son after seeing Billy Jonas live. It is by far my 5 year old son's favorite cd. He has learned new words, scientific theories, and even some history (Mt. St.Helen.) The whole family loves to sing and bang along to all the songs. This is a great car trip cd...I strongly reccomend !"
2,studs lonigan,"""Studs Lonigan"" is a trilogy of novels written by James Farrell about his eponymous hero (who is far more like an anti-hero). Farrell is following the naturalistic method and mode which preceded him by authors like Stephen Crane and Theodore Dreiser. There are various flaws with the opus which are far too numerous to go into, especially if one has read the naturalists, for Farrell adds just about nothing to the genre. Farrell went on to write a huge number of books but from what I have been able to gather he never really departs from this formula. I can only recommend the book if you are not familiar with this American (and European) style. And even then in my opinion there is little to offer."
2,turn off,"The sound quality is good: but the speakers are not great (must plug to headphones or amp 4 good sound). Also, it's heavier (boxy) than other versions and hard to carry around. I am a simple girl. I just need the equipment to stay ON while I play and this one wouldn't. In less than a month, I had to return it (as it wouldn't start again). Shame. I wanted to upgrade as I still use Yamaha's DD-50... Still, I returned this item and now I am affraid to buy another like it."
4,"Very fun, very usable","I'm not a great drummer, but i do like to tool around, and this has a nice sound to it. Nowhere near a full kit replacement, or an electronic kit, but good for making noise (even in your headphones), and takes up very little space. I imagine it would be good for adding miscellaneous pieces to an existing kit too, like triangle, cowbell, etc. so you don't have to lug those around. As others said, the pedals are not the best... the hi-hat triggers a hit when you depress the pedal (instead of muffling it) and the bass pedal gets bleed over from other hits. But for the price, it is a lot of fun."
1,bad deal,"The ad does not point out that the item is refurbished. It does have a note that any refurbished sets only have one pedal. This one has two, but looks like it went through a trash compactor before they shipped it. At no point in the ad did they say it's damaged. I wouldn't buy anything from these guys, ever."
5,Love it and very durable,"What a great heavy keepsake book/toy! You will not be dissappointed by this jigsaw book. Each page has its own clear plastic sleeve, to keep the pieces securely in. Every page is hard back. The text and pictures that correspond with each puzzle page is fabulous. My daughter is 4 and we do this together, as it is to advanced for her to do it independently. Also, each piece is color coded in case of a mix up. Great deal!"
4,THERE IS SOMETHING VERY DAMAGED ABOUT YOU,"Simon Pegg stars as Sidney Young, a hack writer with a British celebrity magazine whose only desire is to be with the people he trashes in his columns. Clayton (Jeff Bridges) is the successful editor of New York celebrity magazine. He offers Sidney a job which he accepts. Sidney quickly discovers he is way out of his league and if he doesn't shape up he will lose his job. Kirsten Dunst plays Simon's boss who sees him as a zero and would like to see him fail. Meagan Fox plays an actress that Simon would like to get close to at any cost.Simon can do no right, sort of an obnoxious Mr. Bean. However as the story progresses we discover that Simon isn't as shallow as our first impression. His turn around and redemption is what turns this film from a romp to a heart warming tale.PARENTAL GUIDE: F-bomb, no sex, nudity (Margo Stilley)"
4,How to lose fans and alienate buyers with this Region 1 release...,"""Simon Pegg has urged fans not to buy the US DVD release of his film How To Lose Friends And Alienate People.Pegg and the comedy's director Robert Weide have both blasted US distributor MGM/Fox for omitting deleted scenes from the disc's extra features.""I was very disappointed when I heard about the lack of extra features on the US DVD, particularly when Bob and I went to great lengths to ensure they were available,"" Pegg said.""[...]With that said, the film itself is pretty funny and has good performances from Simon Pegg and Danny Huston, though somehow Kirsten Dunst didn't work for me. As for Megan Fox, it's tough to tell how much of her performance was acting..."
2,You need to know ISO 9001:2000 Before Buying this book,"If you are not already familiar with the standard, this book is not very helpful. The writing style makes it difficult to read, and this is not a difficult subject. For 1 thing, it is a little to UK focused. In addition, it doesn't really give much guidance for services providers. There are other better books!"
3,Enjoyable and forgetable,"This book is one I enjoyed reading but not enough to seek out other books by the author although I'm apt to read more at some time. However, when I was lent a copy to read, I was several pages in before I realized I already had read it - something very unusual for me.However, the book is an interesting read on how a person (in this case the father) can be controlling using a combination of sense of duty and fear to ensure control. It illustrates the two major ways of adjusting to the control - flight by the son and obedience by the daughter. It builds to an interesting climax where the daughter (now 80) acts for herself. All in all the novel has reasonable plot and character development - definately worth reading but ..."
3,"Good writing, depressing story","This is a well written story about a very depressing life. The author kept me reading, but I would have never read this book had it not been my book club's choice."
3,Do look for a better book; Don't just consider this one!,"OK / fair book in a general sense. As David George states he has only his experience and opinions togo on. A great many of the topics he covers are just basic sense. e.g. Buy life insurance, duh?!? Bad dad doesn'tbuy life insurance. Also, he obviously isn't from NYC or he wouldn't state not posting a ""Child onBoard"" sign isn't helpful. Are you kidding me! We have so many aggressive drivers in this city / state, its been a lifesaver for me and my wife. Bottom line - its OK and could have probably have been half the pages without the fluff."
4,Great Wine Cart for the Price,"I purchased this cart about a month ago. It was delivered in about a week and was easy to assemble. I wanted something cute that wouldn't take up a lot of space. I really love it. I have a small kitchen and it fits perfectly in a nook that I have. Only reason why I am giving this 4 stars is because it was missing one piece. I'm sure I can find the piece at a hardware store, but never bothered. It's fully stacked and holding up just fine, even with out one screw :o)"
1,Poor excuse for a strategy guide,For a game as large and complex as Baldur's Gate you would expect a large and detailed strategy guide. This is not it. It is mediocre at best. You can find better stuff on the web...and that stuff is free!
2,"Not worth it, the manual with the game is all you need!","Do not buy this book if you own the manual that comes with the game, that is all you need! This book is detailed but the manual includes al the information that this book contains. I do not recommend it. Use your manual."
3,It's ok...yet,"not what I expected for a game review, but, given it's date, I'm not surprised early works for pc games generally was lame in the beginning."
1,A total waste of time and money.,No index. No table of contents worth anything. If you want to read the entire book cover to cover will you learn everything you don't want to know. If you want help on just one part of one quest then you are just out of luck. The internet is much better.
2,Extremely worthless...,"This ""guide"" if it qualifies to be called that, has all but no content, it's cryptic, obscure, gives no direct information, and free text/graphic guides from fan sites or gamefaqs on the internet provide infinitely more information for no cost. Avoid this, it's a waste of good money, and all too many trees."
1,WTH I ORDERED THE STRATEGY GUIDE NOT GAME MANUAL,I ordered the strategy guide and received a game manual???? i would like to return this item for a full refund it is not what i ordered and not what i was wanting!!
1,Waste of money,"This book is probably the least useful strategy guide I've seen. At least a quarter of it is basically reprinted/rewritten from the manual, and another half is a ""first person in character"" account of a path through the game. Nowhere are the useful maps found in most strategy guides, descriptions of creatures, or good suggestions on strategy. The encounters section uses a location reference system which isn't explained in any obvious manner (I still haven't found it), and the text is laid out as if they had to fill a certain amount of space and needed to bulk up the book's slim content. Avoid this one at all costs."
5,Still fun to read after twenty years,"I have five children ranging in age from 19 to two years of age. We were fortunate enough to obtain this book for our first child and have enjoyed reading it to each one since. It along with Babies by the same author is one of the best ways to teach very young children about every day emotions such as anger, happiness and love. The illustrations are charming and the stories delightful. I was sorry to learn that it is out of print but am happy to tell you that Babies is still available. After reading hundreds of childrens books these remain at the top of my list."
5,Symphonic Expression of rock at its best,"I do not give 5 stars easily, but this one is truly exemplary. Mostly written by the Spanish keyboard player Carlos Plaza, the music has moments of White Willow's female vocals with lush symphonic keys, along with long composed passages of many instruments.There is no ad libbing or noodling around, but a constant flow of interesting ideas. Guitar and flute take the melodies briefly, always returning to the two players on keys.Other influences would be Kate Bush's dramatic overdubbed vocals and the odd chords perfected by bands such as Isildur's Bane or Anglagard, only in a happier mood like After Crying.Includes 12 songs with a full band and a solo piano piece. Both works have the range of ideas which push the boundaries of symphonic progressive rock without being annoying or boring. Highly recommended."
2,Pegs fit loosely in holes!,"Remember when we were kids, this toy had pegs that fit tightly into the holes? Well, that version of the toy is hard to come by now; I had to order one from England. BEWARE, PARENTS! This toy now has rubber rings on the insides of the holes. The rings become loose after a really short period of use, and the pegs just fall right through them. Even before the rings get loose, the pegs sit in them wobbly and kids don't get the thrill of getting to pound those pegs (bang! bang! bang!). Just a light tap pushes the pegs through the holes. Argh. Do not buy this toy unless you can't tolerate kid noise at all. Try to find the old-fashioned version of this toy, with the tight-fitting pegs. HINT: the old-fashioned version will have longitudinal slots cut into each end of the peg. My 2.5-year-old daughter LOVES the old-fashioned version. She did enjoy this toy for a short while, but not nearly as much as the loud-banging one."
3,Good theme,"I would have to say this is a good movie theme. The only thing that makes it bad is it is very independant film style so some of the horror scenes are a little cheezy! If hollywood would have made this film it would have had excellent reviews! There are a few different hot sex scences. The end leaves you guessing to, its like a puzzle."
4,Very Solid,"This was my first EBM/Indutrial/Whatever You Want To Call It album, and I am quite impressed. Mourn is fiendishly catchy, and how can you not dance to Electricity? I think I like this better than Welcome To Earth, although I seem to be in the minority here. I do feel that it lags a bit in the middle, but both the beginning and end are dead on."
4,I liked this a lot!,"I bought this movie and wasn't sure what to expect but wound up really liking it. i've always been fascinated with the rap industry and the story in this was really cool. Very interesting to see how one person's career is on the rise and what he goes through, while a big star is starting to lose his fame. All the cast is really good. Definitely worth it. I've made all my friends watch it!"
4,Worth the price,"I found the DVD challenging and could ""feel the burn"" on my legs the next day. I also felt a sense of calm and relaxation afterwards. The girl on the video and the setting make for a calm, yet tough enough workout. The music is also pretty subdued. No aerobics of any kind are involved, which, in my opinion, would have made it more fun. But overall, very nicely done!"
5,Feel Good Followin this video,"This dvd was great! I bought it and a pilates video. I like both, but I truly feel like I am getting a workout with this video (though not overdoing it). Prior to starting there is an instructional section that discusses things to consider during pregnancy. I really thought that was beneficial since I knew little about the ""rules"" of exercise during pregnancy."
2,"Challenging Workout, not the most exciting","This video is definitely challenging. It's not easy to find prenatal workouts that will get you to break a sweat (if you're already in very good shape).With that said, if I could go back in time I wouldn't buy this DVD. First of all, the length of the workout is too long for me. I usually work out for about 30 minutes. A 50 minute + workout isn't practical for me, and there's no way (that I could find) to select components of the workout to focus on.Second, I think it's kind of boring. By the end I'm frustrated by the workout and I just want it to be over. It's not a fun workout.Finally, even though I don't see any visible scratches, this DVD skips all the time!So again, I wouldn't recommend this DVD."
5,Love it!,"Its scary buying a video sight-unseen, but this video is exactly what I wanted. I'm more excited about what it DOESN'T HAVE... i.e., theres no fluff (often associated with ""pregnancy""). The instructor wears no bows, and is very soothing, unlike the annoying, 15-year old barking chihuahuas you often get in workout videos. There's no silly routines or disco or stuffed rabbits. As a pre-pregnancy exerciser, I found these exercises concise and effective, and I feel great when I'm done!"
4,Great Workout,"I have always been fit and active, but never attempted Yoga. This video was great because is has different levels of intensity and still gets your heart pumping with the beginner steps. I would suggest getting a mat, some small free weights and a step if you don't have them already."
3,Not quite my style,"The video primarily consists of isometric exercises. For the price it does have a fairly low budget feel about it. After completing the routine my muscles felt tense which I didn't care for. If you're someone who likes exercises that focus on contracting the muscles verses stretching and holding poses (like yoga), then you'll probably like the routine. Personally, I prefer Niece Pacenka's Pilates During Pregnancy."
2,Boring and too easy,"I exercise regularly before and during pregnancy. I bought this DVD based on the reviews saying that it was challenging, that she is a professional cirque de soleil performer, etc and was highly disappointed. There is no warm up and just a few awkward poses. I guess they are afraid to make a pregnant woman do anything physical. I have yet to find a prenatal video that is at all challening. I think it is best to use your favorite exercise video or calss and modify the moves so you feel comfortable. I am 7 months pregnant and do not find this a good workout. I feel it is a waste of time to turn it on. Maybe they are meant for those 8 1/2 months? i don't know. I wish Karen Voight would make one for pregnant women."
2,Slowwwww,Maybe I am more used to get in and out 20min quick workout. The first 3 minutes of dvd already lost my interest. It's a bit weird for a modern mom just wanna get this workout done. I keep telling myself I just have to give it another try someday. The overall motion is a bit slow and too artistic. I am very surprised it received such a high review.
2,too tough for average pregnant woman,i was in fairly good shape before pregnancy- worked out about 3x week average intensity at the gym. but this workout was TOO INTIMIDATING for me while pregnant. this would be good for a PREGNANT ATHLETE who was in awsome shape pre-pregnancy and needed to keep muscle tone high while pregnant. i only did one time when i was 16 weeks along and it was too tough for me!
2,Boring and unbalanced - DON'T BUY THE HYPE!,"After reading other reviews and ordering this video, I had much higher expectations than what it delivered. The video was boring, short, and heavy on the arm excercises. I did not think the price was anywhere close to being a value for what they spent on production of this (which had to be almost nothing). I have Pilates videos that are similar moves but much more entertaining and a better, more balanced workout. I have taught aerobics before and would never have had such dull music and surroundings for a class. I could only get through it once, and decided if I want a low impact workout at home I'll just use my regular Pilates videos. What a waste of $30!"
1,Hardly a workout,I bought this due to all of the great reviews and I am highly disappointed. I sweat more walking to my mailbox. This is being returned immediately.
4,Gets the pulse going,"I bought this because there are really very few aerobic tapes out there to keep up your work out regime. I was a real work out hound, did so four to five times a week at home with Buns of Steel and Kathy Smith Kick Box etc. So I wanted to keep in shape. This video was worth the money as she really uses all your muscles, and is in great shape herself. She picks up weights too a bit which is good. It is definitely different than the Buns of Steel 8 which is more pregnancy aerobics and good for that.I would not suggest using the step though for the opening moves. It seems like it could do what step classes did in the 90's - make your butt actually bigger - and I prefer to just do the Level 3 on the floor.She also does Kagels which reminds me to practice everyday!"
4,My first and only prenatal workout DVD,"It is nice and not boring; I like it, but it is a little too easy for me.If you have always been actively working out (weight lifting regularly) before your pregnancy, this would be very easy for you. I'm now almost 6 months prego; I work out with the ""regular"" Muscle Max and Get Ripped DVDs 4 days a week, and this one is only used once a week."
5,Not easy...in a good way,"I was pleasantly surprised by this video. I am not a fitness guru by any means, but I consider myself in pretty good shape. I was worried any pregnancy workout would be too easy, but this one is not. I do mostly the beginner moves now, and it is not easy. I am glad, too, that there are two other levels to move up to. Combined with some cardio, this workout should have anyone's pregnant body looking great. It is a bit strange because there is a voice over; the person in the video is not talking while showing you the moves. It is also not set up like a traditional workout video; there is not much preparation for different moves, but after only a couple of times, you know what comes next. Also, it is helpful to know that you will need a chair, a mat, and large pillows. Also, if you want to do any of the intermediate or advanced moves, you will need a stair step and hand weights."
3,Gymnastic Mom,The exercises are great because they show variations for beginner to advanced. The instructor is slightly soft spoken but that is relaxing. I definitely felt it in my thighs the next couple of days!
3,"Better than some others, but still not great.","This was purchased for my wife, she used it a few times but really wasn't all that impressed. She ended up giving it away to a friend. It was in her words... better that some others, but still not great."
3,Pretty vigorous and fast for pregnancy,"I found this workout to be a really good workout, but felt very rushed. My goal was to be active during pregnancy, but this was more than I was aiming for. It felt too vigorous to do more than once a week while pregnant, and I eventually stopped doing it. There were some moves that I would just skip, as I wasn't able to do them at 8 months pregnant. She goes so fast between sections that you barely have time to get a chair and move it back during the amount of time given. There were some great sections, but I found that I didn't want to pull out the DVD just for a few minutes of it. After doing the workout, I could feel that my muscles had been worked, but pregnancy made me so tired in the first place that I just didn't have the energy for this one. I found Leisa Hart's FitMama much more conducive to pregnancy, and was easily able to stick with it 5 times a week up until delivery."
2,Weird,"Get the Pilates workout for pregnancy instead. This is weird, to hard, and non- motivational. There are lots off others to consider. Maybe look at a snippet on YouTube first and then buy. I like shiva Rae"
4,Good work out,"I found this was a good workout providing a more energenic excerise than a lot of the others on offer. It also provides different levels for beginner, intermediate and advanced. I didnt give it 5 stars as it wasnt quite as intense as I was expecting"
4,Challenging,"Overall I like this workout. It is challenging both for toning and for getting your heart rate up, although it is mostly a toning workout. I like the beginner and advanced exercise options. The advanced is really advanced and the beginner is still quite challenging. My only real complaint is that during the workout there is very little explanation of how to do the exercises. There is a separate instructional section, but it is hard to remember the proper form when you are tired from exercise. A few reminders on how to keep form would be really helpful."
2,not well organized,"This book is more about measure theory and pure statistical properties. For me (as a practicer), I found it's difficult toextract important information for the book.My biggest complain is in first few chapters, the authers simplylist all definition, properties and proofs without a single exampleto help readers understand. And the notations are quite complicated which gives readers no clue if one reads directly from the later chapters (more algorithms involved).Through out the entire book, I can't find any complete and concreteapplications. The bottomline is this book is neither practicalnor can serve a textbook to understand fundamental statistical theories."
3,"Not bad, but slow.","I'm sure a number of reviews say the same thing: this book is slow.I picked this up because I loved all of the Ender and Bean series, and I was expecting something more like those I suppose. Unfortunately, I may have missed the part about this book being the first in a series, because I kept waiting for something to happen. It didn't. Pretty much ever.Unfortunately, I'm not sure I have the patience to work my way through another book or two to get to the meat of the story, which, I have no doubt, is excellent, whenever it arrives. At any rate, I'm in no hurry to get back on that meandering path."
2,underwhelming,"I'm not sure this book deserves all the acclaim it has gotten, both here and in other reviews. It is a little different, but it is painfully slow and seems to be made up of smaller segments, each of which don't really make any contribution to the overall plot. The characters are quite thin and the course of the book is relatively predictable. I give it a thourough ""ho-hum."""
5,Suprisingly Good for a Science Fiction,"I usually cringe when I think about Trekkies on the Sci Fi channel. This book was pretty cool. The fact that the main character in the expository phase entered the conclusion was absolute genius, although ""Taleswapper"" was a pretty lame character. Be sure to read the rest of the books in this series."
5,I am very happy with this purchase.,"I reviewed several different options before I bought this camera and I have to say I made the right choice.Lightweight, takes great shots and has more options than I'll every use. In fact if I has one critical comment is that there are so many options and remembering how to get to each is a tad confusing. I'm sure with time all will be fine.Otherwise I love this camera. My first roll was of friends in a marathon and I got some spectacular action shots. Not to mention some great portrait shots on the same trip.A great camera to make that next step beyond the point and shoot. I am looking forward to how my photography improves with the Maxxum 5."
4,Great Camera,"I love this camera - all the features you could want, reliably great pictures. Only two minor beefs - one, the autofocus is stupid. It sometimes doesn't register that it is focused, and will not allow the photo to be taken - switching to manual focus solves this. Two, I'd prefer a faster max shutter speed - I've been limited a few times by the max 1/2000 second speed. I've taken great pictures witht his camera, and it has survived handily in environments from the Sahara desert to the Amazon Jungle."
4,Guaranteed to make you have fun,"I own a Maxxum, but older, and I only can say, awsome.Automatic features that make this camera a pro with just the touch of a button.I specially like to use it with a iso400 films."
2,sorrowful saturday,"it twas a sorrowful day that i received the most recent belle and sebastian album in the post. i love the band, i truly do, but i do not dig this new album, try as i might. after listening to it at least once a day for two weeks i've finally come to grasp that this is just not up to my ideals. the lyrics are dull, the music is flat. it's all around a big disappointment. ""waiting for the moon to rise"" is however well worth the investment. the song is hauntingly familiar and beautiful in all its sorrow. still it'd be a great single. the rest will remain on the shelf."
2,Shallow as well as boring,I have been a fan of Belle and sebastian for years. But starting with the boy with the arab strap this band has broken my heart. Everyone likes their new music which I can understand due to it's catchiness. But the talent I saw shine before is nothing more than a flicker on this album. It's sad to see good bands get recognition for the wrong stuff but I guess that's how the music business works.
4,Fair condition,"I don't have any comments for this item I ordered, I just needed season two because I owned all 4 seasons expect this one. So, I'm very glad that I have all of them."
4,Great series!,"This is a great series, and I was able to pick up the whole series for an unbelievable price!"
5,Great Series,I was hooked after Season 1 and Season 2 only got better. The twists and turns were unexpected. I highly recommend this series.
1,NICE LEGS,"Once again sexy cougar on the cover, but not much inside. This silly show isn't as bad as many others, and a few really bad shows out there but I don't see why even a small audience would buy into something like this BS. I mean when you think about it a lot of fine things like classical music, cultural studies, unique wines and art really aren't always appreciated by the masses and within all those things I mentioned there are even sub groups that like certain elements about them as well. Just an observation. This show might deserve 1.5 stars for the cool cover and I'll admit there are far worse programs on the old cancer box (TV) than this."
5,Pure perfection,This is one of the best albums I have ever hear. Not just blues but albums period. The man was a genius. Check out his other albums as well. But if you are looking for your first Albert King album look no further
3,Not his best sounding work by far.,"This may be the album that made the man but it's not his best work. The clips above are by far the best part of the album. Less than simple blues leads, wrong notes played in several places with attempts to cover it by horns are noticible. The horn section on a couple of the songs is down right disturbing."
4,Light up our nursery ....,"I love this little lamp. It matches the Zanzibar theme well, and isn't too pricey. It comes packed well to protect the little animals at the bottom and the shade is also well protected. I don't care for the white cord which really stands out when you go with a neutral cream & sage colored nursery to match the theme. It will accept up to a 60 watt bulb (I'd prefer 75). But all in all, it's a must have for a complete Zanzibar nursery :)"
3,"great as pda, worse as wireless device","I got mine for a year. I love it as pda, ie. storing datas, writing and docs, etc. However, its wifi connection is no more than 2 rooms away inside my house that made me frustrated not to connect the device in many airports. Also, it does not support Java that means no Youtube, websites with stock index, etc. (although Youtube would play with its independent software that requires downloading-needs more space.)"
1,Poor performer,"I bought this used so am not sure how much is the result of product vs prior use. In general, it was virtually unusable in syncing with other devices compared to HP, Compaq, and other Windows units"
1,Give me a break!,"Okay, I'll admit I haven't seen this turkey...so this is a review of the trailer that other guy provided. My guess is that he's part of the production team trying to sell this slop to the unsuspecting public. Did you notice how all these ""students"" look to be in their 30's? Hell, some of them might be in their 40's from the looks of it. I'm starting to think they are older than the teacher. Doesn't that destroy the unsavory nature of the relationship? Is she luring an old geezer into sin by wearing tight clothes and bending over? It's just a bunch of old people having sex. Who cares? You've got to do better than that to make me want to see this dud. That trailer is enough to make me run away from this teacher. My money stays in my wallet."
1,Pure trash!,"I bought this book thinking about a great source of info about the show & characters, but the only thing I could find were CRITICS, nasty critics by the way. I hate the book, I couldn't even finish to read it 'cause it is disgusting for anyonw who likes the show. I highly recomend you to go for the Official Guite just in case you didn't check it out yet."
4,Gift,This was purchased as a gift for a Simpsons fan. The plastic that sealed it shut came tore but game was intact.
4,great,"these guys are great and theres nothing more to say very under rated these cd,s are alot different from the old whitecross with rex carroll on guitars but just as strong and in some places stronger this music is better than half the music they have on the market now days"
3,stop leak,"It may be OK for very small leaks, but it did not work for me. May be mine was just too far along"
2,What happened to Native American culture?,Entirely to much of a fixation on sex and very little use of Indian culture! Had to skip a lot of the book just to stay on storyline.
5,Great Team Based FPS,This is the best FPS team based shooter I've played. Runs smooth as silk and the variety of classes and maps you can play give this a high replay value. I've had this game since it came out and still have fun with it.
1,So lame I'm selling it...,I received this game as a gift and it simply wasn't very much fun. Gameplay is unrealistic and hyperactive. I honestly didn't bother learning much about the in-game goals or teamwork...it just wasn't interesting or involving enough to dedicate the time.I enjoy FPS games and just beat COD4 and I'm working on Bioshock and Crysis...none of these are phenomenal (when compared to HL2) but all are better than QW:ET.
2,Not a workout compared to The Perfect Pregnancy Workout,"I absolutely loved the Perfect Pregnancy Workout by Karyne....just couldn't get into this one.I started doing this video when my baby was about a month old. I had worked out with her Perfect Pregnancy Workout up until a couple of weeks before the birth of my son.I personally found the exercises not challenging enough and awkward...maybe I was looking for doing too much too soon?! Just was not as impressed with this video. I found myself going through the entire video to feel like I had exercised. I did the workout half a dozen times and then went to the library and got a Denise Austin video. Sorry...it just wasn't as good as the pregnancy video.Her Prefect Pregnancy Workout is definately worth it, not this one though."
1,Ultra Boring,Give it up. First a million of songs dedicated to Notorious Big and now the same to JLO. This is boring and commerical. He might earn alot of cash in this way but i will never respect him as true musician. Do us all a favor now and retire cause this stuff is getting more annoying for each single release.
2,not my cup of tea,Since I have everything a.m. has recoreded I was suprised to find I had missed this one. Unfort i could live without this one. Songs are outdated and the arrangements are too cheesy.
3,"Trekking into ""Lost in Space"" Territory","It must be a sci-fi staple that aliens just love to possess us weak-minded earthlings. No less than five episodes of the 60's ""Lost in Space"" had a similar theme. Even the original Trek toyed with the idea itself - one of the most memorable episodes being the last, ""Turnabout Intruder"".Obviously, it was time for ST: NG to have its shot at it and this one is a doozy. Three crew members (Troi, Data, and O'Brien) have their psyche shared by aliens intending on freeing thousands of their kinsmen (with the assistance of the Enterprise, of course).While the credibility of the plot is stretched somewhat, the installment does allow Marina Sirtis, Brent Spiner, and Colm Meaney some time to chew the scenery. Many episode were devoted to ""Data""; thus, ""Deana"" and ""Miles"" were highlighted, although not as their usual good-as-gold Federation officers."
1,Don't buy or use this product!!,"Unless you have NO sense of taste, do NOT use this product. It's been 3 days since I cleaned my keyboard with this and I haven't had a moment without bitter taste in my mouth!!!! I'm about to throw my keyboard away as I can't stand it any longer!!! Wiping down with alcohol wipes or other cleaners didn't change this. I know how to use canned air products correctly (not upside down etc.) but even using this correctly creates a taste issue I can't shake! Don't buy this, don't use this, don't even touch the can to throw it away! (use gloves or at least a paper towel) And the dairy/chocolate idea from 3M's website doesn't work to remove the taste. I'm hoping time will make it go away but I'm going to have to get a new keyboard and wipe down everything near where I sprayed. I rate this a NEGATIVE 5 stars!"
3,Not worth the money,"This product is not the best lipbalm for the money. It is okay, but products like burts bees are better or the same in quality for a lesser price."
3,Mariachi but not enough,"These two CD set of mariachi music is just as the title states a compilation of various artists interpreting classic mariachi songs. It is an excellent set for the novice collector of mariachi music or as one's first introduction into mariachi music. However some the selections lack the full sound of a Marichi Vargas and although included are two classic revolutionary era favorites ""Traigo Mi 45"" and ""carabina 30/30"" also missing from that era are ""Valentin de la Sierra"" and ""La Rielera."" Most dissappointing was ""La Adelita"" selection which here was an instrumental, depriving ther listener of those sad heart wrenching lyrics. Overall excellent begginer set."
2,CHANGED MY OPINION TO FOUR STARS,"I HAVE EDITED MY 1ST REVIEW.IT WAS PRETTY CRITICAL.AND NOW FOR MY NEW THOUGHTS.......... THESE PENS HAVE STOOD THE TEST OF OF TIME. THEY LEAVE A BOLD IMAGE, BUT THEY DRY SLOWLY. BEWARE OF SMUDGING. THE TIPS HAVE SEEMED NOT TO WEAR DOWN MUSHY LIKE SOME OTHERS BUT THE GREEN IS PALE FOR MY TASTE, I'D RATHER HAVE TWO BLACK PENS.I'D LIKE TO UP MY RATING TO FOUR STARS. THE NEXT TIME I NEED NEW PENS I'LL BE LOOKING FOR THESE."
2,Not for real use,"This might be an OK keyboard for home media use, where you use it very little... granted I don't know how you would use a mouse in a situation like that though.But as a daily keyboard, this just doesn't cut it. It has a very awkward feel to it. The slight curve on the keyboard isn't ergonomic at all and there is no elevation change as you would expect from an ergonomic keyboard... so what you get is the worst of both worlds... people who want ergonomics won't get it and people who can't stand ergonomic keyboards won't like it either.I really have no clue who Microsoft's target audience was for this product."
3,"keyboard's nice, mouse is flaky, Microsoft support terrible. Mac users beware.","Could just be /my/ mouse, but it's been flaky since day 1. Would work for awhile then sometimes just randomly die. I'd retry it the next day and it would work, go figure. Now it seems to have died for good and I'm calling Msft for support. I hope they take care of it. This stupid thing is only 5 months old!Oh, the keyboard is nice though, sleek and light and although there's a minute lag due to the Btooth, it's pretty useful. I prefer the raised keys but overall the kybd is pretty good. So, 4 stars for keyboard, 1 for the mouse, = 3 stars."
2,Meh... mediocre quality at best.,I bought this back in 2008. I hate the mouse more than any mouse I've ever come across. I played World of Warcraft for hours and so put a ton of demand on my mouse and keyboard. For whatever reason the bluetooth connection with both the mouse and keyboard was VERY spotty at times and really really ticked me off at critical gaming moments. The mouse connection sucks worse than the keyboard connection and even when I would just be sitting still in the game for a few seconds the mouse would time out or something and I'd have to jolt it back and forth to get it to start responding again. The keyboard would also do this... I'd have to mash keys to get it to kick back into gear and start recognizing key strokes again. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO ANYONE FOR ANY REASON. I cannot stand it and wish I'd never blown $100 on such an inferior product. RUN the other way and buy something from any other company. Microsoft DOES NOT make a good bluetooth keyboard and mouse.
3,I regret buying this.,"I really wanted to like this keyboard, but I can't avoid the problems with it anymore.#1) The keys are just too far apart to get used to. I have a work computer, and when I come home it takes me quite a while to get used to the very large keys.#2) Mouse left click is too hard to click. I find that the way I hold a mouse by default doesn't work too well with this keyboard. Often I find myself having to push way too hard. It actually makes my entire arm hurt if I use it too long.#3) Mouse scroll wheel feels too ""gummy"" -- I guess some might like that it feels smooth, but to me there's too much resistance.#4) No number pad. This is my fault. I didn't realize how often I would use it. Now that it's gone, I miss it.#5) Touch sensitive function ""keys."" I guarantee after buying this you'll find yourself resting your fingers on one of the touch sensitive keys after your computer freaks out.Other than these problems, it's a cool set up. However, I wish I had gone with something else."
3,Microsoft Keyboard 7000,"An OK product, kind of pricey. Seems like it lags when you type, but frees up cords."
4,Comes close to the actual,"I was present as a volunteer at the chapel. This book comes close but doesn't portray the full variety of people, of gifts and of sanctuary at this hallowed place.For example, the photos of the gifts sent by others seems repetitive and not representative of some of the sentimental and heart-warming aspects: Kids who sent their teddy bears--big workers asleep on the pews hugging those bears. Quilts sent by sewing circles-same kind of reaction from the workers. The huge outpouring of donations from corportations across the country-from clothes to food to toiletries. As Diane said, ""somehow the generator keeps working with no one paying to have it refilled and somehow the toilet gets replaced before the church officials had to ask.""I have many lifetime memories of that time-but no pictures, since we all honored the privacy wishes of the workers.This book comes close but does not capture it all."
4,A Living Hell,"Simply put, this book is excellent. The author's judicious use the combatants' own words to illustrate the living hell that was the land battle for the South Pacific is a more moving and evocative account than any I have read previously. He does an extremely fine job of framing the conflict with the civil, social and military background of the three nations that took part -- America, Australia and Japan. Similarly, he clearly explains in lay terms the complex workings of the military machine, a point often overlooked many military writers. For example, how many men make up a Division? What's a platoon? My only criticism is that the personal Japanese perspective is mostly overlooked. While the reader will gain a great understanding of the personal terror faced by the victors, it would have been nice to glimpse into the psyche of the vanquished. All up though, a great read and one that should humble any reader who thinks he of she had a bad day at work."
4,Worth Reading,"As a narrative I didn't care for this book. But it is highly detailed and richly documented. If you are interested in a detailed account of what battle was like in the steaming jungles of the South Pacific, this book will describe the worst. The author masterfully covers tactics, weapons, and terrain and how the soldiers on both sides had to adapt themselves to the world's most bitter environment. That these men could wage war under such grueling circumstances is amassing in itself. You will be asking yourself as you read, `Could I have done such things in my youth?' It will surly increase your admiration for the America Marine of WWII."
3,TOO MANY ADVERBS AND ADJECTIVES,"I found Bergerud's book informative and useful as a research tool, but as is the case in too many books, he uses too many adverbs and adjectives. He describes almost everything as ""very"" this and ""very"" that, to the point that I found myself mentally deleting every ""very"" I came across, and they are on every page of the book. That sort of writing always puts the breaks on a read for me. There were also a number of typos, but that is to be expected in almost any book and should not be held against the author unless there are a lot of them. The one typo that threw me to the point of stopping and wondering what he was talking about, was ""St. Cry."" It finally dawned on me that he meant ""St. Cyr,"" the French equivalent of West Point."
2,Won't work with windows 7.,Wouldn't work with any of my computers so it was money wasted.Tired on line fix and that didn't work either.Becareful to check what it will work on.
2,Don't lose the CD. Not a regular USB device. Software required.,I'm really mad at Olympus.I had to reinstall my operating system for reasons unrelated to this product. Now I can't use the DVR because I don't have the original CD.You need special software to pull the .avi files from the device.Do I still have the original CD? No.Can I download the software from Olympus's website? No.Can I download it elsewhere? No.Can you use the device like a regular USB hard drive? No.
3,Good for memos - bad for podcasts,"The quality isn't up to par for podcasting but if you need memos.. it's handy.. and the software keeps it all well organized.. if you have a newer ipod tho, you should make use of the [...]"
2,Nice recorder but obsolete,"Olympus VN3100PC Digital Voice RecorderWhen I first got this nice little digital recorder earlier this year I was very pleased. It worked very well as described by Olympus and I had no problems connecting to my PC. But then I recently got a new PC with a Vista 64-bit operating system. That, unfortunately, made my digital recorder obsolete because Olympus does not provide driver support for 64-bit systems (as of September 2008). To make matters worse, Olympus did not even answer my request for information about future plans to provide the necessary driver. I would have given this product four stars except for this serious problem. Anyone considering getting a new PC in the near future with a 64-bit operating system should not buy this product."
5,A Spell Has Been Cast . . .,"I received this cd just about a month ago, popped it in my cd player in the truck and . . . I haven't taken it out once since. I love to hear instruments and voices that blend so perfectly together that they almost become one (throw in a teanie tiny bit of piano and I'm almost always hooked). Add to that some truley brilliant lyrics and I couldn't be any happier. My favorite song is the last one on the cd (which is actually two songs bridged together as one). The melodies are great, I can see ""the brillance of the light at night"", and I enjoy the manner in which the voices play with each other on this one.I don't own any other Grey Eye Glances but this WON'T be my last. Thanks to Amazon for the recommendation. I've tripped across some great finds thanks to this feature."
2,Spiking my work,"I had problems with this product. in trying to use it to select specific areas, draw, etc. I found it spiked (jumped almost off of the 'page' and came right back to the point I where I'd moved the pen in the second or so). I found it profoundly annoying and random. I also found that the width of the line it would create would vary through no assistance of my own. Nothing I tried would get it to operate at the thickness I'd chosen (even increasing the thickness in the program several times the size I wanted). I'm sad to say there is not a lot good I can say about the product. I gave it my best shot, but found it to be unreliable and therefore not for me.I will say this after a long wait on the long distance call I made to get technical support for this product I was finally given a toll free number where a representative told me there was nothing I could do to fix it and Suggested, begrudgingly, that I return it. I did.I hope someone had a better experiences than I did with it.:)"
4,Dissing the dictionary,"The dictionary purchased is an excellent dictionary, profusely illustrated with exceptional color images. The inside back cover had a split in the paper, not too damaging to leave the book useful to me. The packing was much too flimsy for the heavy volume being shipped, leaving the cover a bit tattered. My only recommendation: use shipping envelopes or boxes heavy enough to carry the product."
3,LA EPOCA DE ORO DEL CHA CHA CHA,"I agree with Everardo's assessment of these two CD's. I believe Orfeon tried to capture the sound they already had at their disposal in their vast master tape vaults. All they had to do is re-issue the original Orquesta Enrique Jorrin takes, recorded by Jorrin for Orfeon during 1957 and 58, his final years in Mexico, before returning to Cuba. These are wonderful hits that have hardly been used by Orfeon, for reasons best known to them. Also it should've been relatively easy for them to feature old RCA recordings of both ""Orquestas America and Aragon"", since BMG has been ""leasing"" a lot of these masters to different latin music labels. However these new recordings of the old originals are not without good rhythm, the chorus should've been improved by a veteran charanga soloist like Rudy Calzado. The orchestration and arrangements are pretty decent and professional and I think deserve at least 3 stars."
4,Pro/e WF3 review,"Pretty much as advertised. This manual is helpful for the beginner, but a current user will end up finding it a bit slim on real world applications. It is not as thorough as a real user guide."
3,OKAY,"Unfortunately I overlooked the fact that the Multi-Media CD was not available and being green with the program, I am struggling to learn it."
1,Don't be Fooled America,"This music is Backstreet Boy revival. Remember all of those boy bands a few years back? Close your eyes and listen to this, it is the same. Whenever I see that pathetically gimicky video, I just want to smack that histrionic lead singer. The way he does a little ""bye-bye"" each time the bit of the song comes around! Ugh! Plus his stylist has him dressed up like the Dashboard guy. It seemed as if mainstream pop was going such a nice direction: Outkast, Missy, Britney's new album, which seems to share Missy Elliot and Kylie Minogue influences, etc. Please, just ignore this horrible hiccup."
1,"bad, bad music",After reading the reviews I thought I had really found something. This sounds so manufactured. Total Boy band material in a different format. Dont even listen to it. Horrible.
4,Good Album,Good music. If you like this you'd like Joe Sneva. www.joesneva.com I think he used to open for Maroon 5.
4,"A catchy, unique awesome CD","Maroon5 (Adam Lavine in particular) have become one of my favorite bands. Their sound is so catchy and unique, and their material is genuine, unlike to many other artists of today.The following is my track-to-track analysis:1. Harder to Breathe 4/5 Upbeat and catchy, but not my favorite2. This Love 4/5 Wouldn't be my choice for a single, but good3. Shiver 4.5/5 One of my favorite tracks4. She Will Be Loved 4.5/5 Almost perfect - another favorite5. Tangled 4.5/5 Almost ""cookie-cutter"" - but excellent6. The Sun 4.5/5 A really fun and different song7. Must Get Out 4.5/5 Another awesome track8. Sunday Morning 4.5/5 The hits just keep on coming!9. Secret 4/5 Sort-of a filler sounding track10. Through With You 4/5 Same as above11. Not Coming Home (Live)4.5/5 The unique beat makes this song perfect12. Sweetest Goodbye 4.5/5 The perfect way to close a great album!I definately reccomend SONGS ABOUT JANE by Maroon 5, in addition to Blue Skies by Diana DeGarmo."
4,What happens when John mayer fathers j-tims kid???,"MAROON 5! One would see this as a bad thing however this funk driven debut from those crazy kids my head bouncing in my car all day long. Its catchy ,shamelessly melodic and leaves you with a a smile and a stiff neck. The 4 stars is a result of its lack of impact. I dont know jane... Im sure shes a great girl, however it to me they really didnt have much to say. So, i based most of my review on the music and its ability to move the listener, not the cliche lyrics about a girl that we've alllllllll heard before."
5,Freaking awesome,"I love Maroon 5 SO much! They have such beautiful songs! My number one favorite is definitely ""She Will be Loved"" It makes me melt everytime I hear it. It seems as though Adam is serenading me with it. Good lord is he hot! Hah. But yeah everyone should own this CD. I've had it since it first released in 2002 and I cannot believe it's taken this long for them to get big but it's about dang time! There's no going wrong with ""Songs About Jane"""
1,The biggest que*rs in pop,"These guys make clay aiken look like the toughest mo foe' around. How anyone could force themselves to listen to a bunch of wiggers doing r&b that would make the likes of ""raven symone"" cringe is beyond me. I guess it's this talentless hip-hop explosion (which will die out soon, trust me), that's got everyone excited about a middle-of-the-road, nothing special cheeze pop band. They have huge egos too, ones that would make kanye west green with envy. Total garbage, and if you call this rock, you deserve to be shot."
5,A Great Cd,"Maroon 5's cd 'Songs About Jane' is a wonderful cd. I bought it about a month after their first music video was aired on VH1. I only listened to the first 4 songs until hurricane Francis and Jeane forced us to evacuate, i ended up listening to this cd so many times i had the whole cd memorized! It is a wonderful cd which blends R&B and Rock extremely well. Once you buy this cd, it will easily become one of your favourite cds. Or, if not, then you will love singing along to the songs from the cd as you listen in your car or home."
1,Awful and forgettable.,"How on earth can you give this bland recording 5 Stars?Five stars is for Dark Side of the Moon, Electric Ladyland,Led Zeppelin III, Radiohead - Ok Computer, Tool - Aenima etc..Not this nonsense...five stars this is not....If you think this is good, then go and listen to anythingStevie Wonder has done and you will think Jesus has come backand handed you music.... :)These guys just rip Stevie off....and they do it poorly...Branch out, oh poor brainwashed by the industry listener and find something that isnt being shoved down your throat by radio, Mtv or whatever else...!This album is proof that the Grammys' mean nothing anymore...its almost just a showcase for what ""The Man"" is telling you to buy.Here's a test, and remember this now....in 10 years ask someone who maroon five is and I bet they are a distant memory or completely forgotton"
2,Kravitz Jamiroquai Living Colour Stevie Wonder... all better,"I don't think calling Maroon 5 a cloned boy band remake of those mentioned in the subject line is a stretch... Kudos for parroting skills, though."
1,M O R O N 5,I CANT BELIEVE HOW STUPID YOU ALL ARE!!!!!!ONLY A MORON WOULD LISTEN TO THESE MORONS!!!!!!!!!!!!!I KNOW YOU CANT UNDERSTAND WHAT I MEAN BECAUSE Y O U - A R E - A L L - T O O - S T U P I D - T O - U N D E R S T A N D - A N Y T H I N G!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!IF YOU DISAGREE FEEL FREE TO E-MAIL ME AT Zapotec123@aol.com
5,Love this album...,"But, the rest of their albums all sound the same. Pity, I love Adam, but their music is just they same sounds over and over."
1,yet another overhyped and overrated pop/rock band,"yet another boring pop/rock band that is pushed forward by media hype, this simply does not mean that it is good music in anyway shape or form,i know good music when i hear it and i've been listening to music for many years now(old & new). Simply put is that pop/rock music is not the same as its used to be, now we have overhyped rubbish such as this band making overrated annoying music that people sadly buy and ""think"" it is good music, listen to older pop/rock music and then you'll see what i mean when modern pop/rock bands in today's world suck. It also sucks when bands with actual tallent such as ""creed"" break up and we still have these other rubbish music in the airwaves, people who buy this type of music are only fooling themselves and that truly is sad."
1,Don't Be Fooled,"I purchased this CD after hearing the single ""Harder To Breathe"" which is a great song. The rest of the CD sounds likeit was done by a different band. There is not one other song like Harder To Breathe on the album. That wouldn't be so bad if any of the other songs were good, but they are not.The rest sounds like a total Jamiroquai rip-off. Beware, this has one hit wonder written all over it."
4,mAROON 5 REVIEW,"Take one sneak peak into new bands these days and if you want to find raw talent you have located Maroon 5. The pop/rock/soul combination had made this band a complete first album.With there hit song Harder to Breath these 5 young guys who debueed 1997 with there album The Fourth World with the name as Kara's Flowers. Now as the band prepares to debut there brand new C.D. with a new name called Maroon 5.With quotes like, ""Is there anyone out there, cause its getting harder and harder to breath."" With there brand new video just realesed by Octone Records it shows the 5 members rocking out to there future.Though as the sound of music sounds just like what you will here on the radio stations like 91X and 933 every day, but there is something unique about the band, it is not the usual boy band music. The CD contains addictive, energetic, innovate pure funk rock."
1,Original?,How can a band have the originality of Jamiroquai? Surely copying originality would make you unoriginal and awful. Well that's what it did to Maroon 5. Possibly the worst album of all time.
1,soon we'll catch them on the one hit wonder marathon,"This Love is their only good song, it has a catchy motown-sounding musical sound to it but that's it. The voice is annoying and their performing with instruments and in the bedroom as seen in the video was a real turnoff, I knew they were losers the minute I laid my eyes on them."
2,VERY disappointing,"I bought this album after hearing their single ""Harder to Breathe"" The song just blew me away with the lyrics and over all sound combined with the percise rythm. However, it was the one and only song on the album that fits into the rock genre...the rest of the cd consists all pop songs, some of which made me ill. There are at LEAST 5 filler songs on this album. I can definately see the appeal of the song ""This Love"", but the rest of this album consists of a very tired out sound that almost all pop/rock bands have.Overall I'd say if this cd is priced over $8.00 find another band."
5,love it,"this was listed as ""used"", but you'd never be able to tell from listening to it. the cd plays perfectly, i'm very happy with my purchase"
5,Summer Memories,"This CD is really one of the better musical inspirations that has come out in awhile. With all of the reviews already, I'd be repeating to try to explain their style, but I can tell you I saw them live at the University of Maine and they were incredible. It made the album seem like it was a cover band trying to capture their true sound.Songs About Jane melds sexuality, soulfulness, happiness, sadness, wittiness, and many other mature elements that truly show a great intellect in the musicianship as well as the lyrical content. A sense of duality is always entertained, and that is truly refreshing.If you like ""Harder to Breathe"" and what has been on mass rotation, check out this CD. Those songs are just the tip of the iceberg."
5,OH MY GOD,"this cd is simply amazing. i usually listen to either hip hop or rap but there something about maroon 5's sound that i just cant enough of. it mixes different genres into one amazing sound. buy this thing, no joke."
4,What a great album!,"I heard ""This Love"" about two summers ago. I fell in love with it and got the album right away. It's great that they're finally getting the exposure that they need on radio and TV. Never before have I heard such a great blend of funk, soul, and rock. Unless you've got a stick up your ass it's hard to imagine why you wouldn't like this album.I gave it 4 stars because I find myself getting bored with it sometimes, however the album is still one of my favorites will be getting a lot of play in the years to come."
2,"Horrible, worthless vocals","I bought this album after hearing the song This Love. After listening to only a few songs I have come to the firm conclusion that this is a decent band with good talent and a possible future... if they ditch their lead singer. The boy sounds like a shabby ripoff of Justin Timberlake and should not be allowed to open his mouth and release any vocal utterence for any reason whatsoever. After the secon song... not second listen second song.... the album sound repetitive and whiny. Don't buy this album unless you have a disire to listen to music that makes one desire to beat your head against a hard object. However, there is one plus to this album.... it's better than Good Charlotte.Jet's diss on this band was on target and perfectly aimed (Jet is a hundred times better go buy that album, Get Born NOW)."
2,"Hardly,","This is a classic example of the rest of the album not living up to the single. Sure, ""Harder to Breathe"" is a good song. It is the reason I gave 2 stars. The rest of the album comes across listless and weak after the opener. Please, listen to the tepid samples on amazon and you will see the rest of the songs seem flat."
4,"Fun album, you should own this!","The first song I heard from Maroon 5 was ""Harder to Breathe"" and at first I thought it was Justin Timberlake, as did many of my friends when they listend to it. I was very turned off by it at first, but the rhythym and the beat were so catchy I had to hear more.I was definitely not disappointed with this CD!! I find myself playing ""Sunday Morning"" so many times that my roommates have memorized the lyrics and they don't know who Maroon 5 is! It's such a light but funky groove tune, backed up by Jamiroquai-esque piano and some of the slickest vocals I've heard in a long time.Of course every song is worth listening to, ""This Love"" I suggest checking out if you've never heard the band!Only reason I couldn't go 5-stars is, well, at some points it does sound like Justin Timberlake, and that just don't fly in my musical collection ;)"
1,Trite lyrics hiding behind a catchy pop exterior,"I hate to admit that I was initially attracted by this band. Adam Levine has an incredible voice and the musical orchestration was catchy, funky and cute. But after a few more listens, I became really disappointed with the lyrics; they were trite, vapid and basically put together to link up with the musical phrasing. There is no semblance of meaning behind any of their lyrics, and they read like a stream-of-consciousness diary entry written by a 9 year old. For example, the much overplayed ""She Will Be Loved"" confuses pronouns (he, she, I) and point-of-view so much that it is completely divested of significance (just WHO are you asking to ""look for the girl with the broken smile""?) and becomes an overbearing chore to listen to. The horrible lyrics diminish the excellence of Levine's voice and the musical orchestration, which makes me wonder how good this band might be with some decent songwriting."
1,SheEeEe WwiIIiIilLLlLLL bbeEeEee LooVvVEDdDd 0/10,"You know what? I don't know Jane, but I already hate her."
3,Soulful Songs,"Maroon 5's Songs About Jane was released in June 2002 and it took a long climb into the top ten peaking at number seven earlier this year. The album is a mix of bluesy, white soul music with a dash of funk throw in. The band has a strong and slick musicianship and lead singer Adam Levine has a pretty decent voice. Mr. Levine is a romantic at heart and his lyrics are ripe with obsessions about beauty and lust. The first single from the album ""Harder To Breathe"" shows the band's soulful side while ""Shiver"" is in the funk-blues vein. ""Must Get Out"" is a slow, pretty song. The album's best track and a truly great single is ""This Love"". The song has a pumping, sing-along chorus, funky guitar riff and pounding piano that create a real, old-fashion soul rave-up. The rest of the album is solid, but not spectacular."
3,Galactic Civilizations II Gold,"Previously described by other reviewers as ""Civ 4 in space.""Yeah - an extremely slow version of seriously micromanaged Civ 4.The economics and planetary build-ups are also not terribly realistic.I did play it, however, and continue to do so - but I liked Civ 4 much more.I would not say that it was a waste of money - I just expected something different."
1,stains orange,I stained a white swimsuit orange around the edges - there's a chemical reaction between the sunscreen and hard water. The stains appear when you wash it! Barkeeper's Friend seems to be taking it out...I'm very frustrated.
1,"Stains clothing, sticky feel","I have used the Coppertone Pure and Simple lotion and loved it but for a Disney trip I wanted something easier to re-apply in the parks. While this offered great sun protection (after a full week at Disney, no one in our family was sunburned), this product stained all of our white/light colored clothing. Also, it leaves a sticky residue on the skin that even after showering, only vigorous rubbing with a towel removed the residue. I cannot seem to get the stains out of the clothes at ALL even after numerous washing with bleach. After researching the product on-line, I found many other complaints regarding the same issue of stained clothing. I would give this product negative stars if I could, and will definitely not recommend anyone to purchase it (unless you prefer to wear your clothes with stains...). I was very disappointed in the product, especially since I have had such great experience with the Pure&Simple lotion sunscreen."
3,Not too bad but a little tedious,"I've never read anything by this author before, and I was impressed with some of her skills, but her lack of attention to the way people really spoke in the Regency era was bothersome. Some of the turns of phrase she incorporated were just too ""today"". Also, there were longish stretches in the story that were somewhat boring and I found myself ""skimming"". I found the plot pretty unrealistic (even for a romance novel). Only the will to find out what would become of Katherine and Alain, who remained interesting characters, drove me on. But this was definitely not a keeper for me. If you're a die-hard fan of this author, get it, but if not, wait for the bargain bin."
3,"Good timer, Poor Quality","This really helped me when my daughter was first born. All the sleepless nights were easier using this product.It had a left/right setting and the back-light was great. Also I found the alarm setting very helpful.However, this is not made to take any bumps. I knocked it off the table a few times and the wiring inside was damaged. I would give it 5 stars if it wasn't so easily broken."
1,lasted 2 weeks,"This timer was somewhat useful but the buttons stopped working right at the 2 week mark. Anyway, there's an app for that. Several in fact if you have an iphone/ipad/iwhatever. Similac has a free one but there's also ""total baby"", ""baby connect"", and several others which are more useful than the Itzbeen because they store the information and you can go back and look at trends etc."
5,Couldn't live with it!,When our little girl was first born I couldn't have lived without this! In the middle of the night all I had to do was re-set the button rather then trying to remember the last time I fed her and it helps you keep track of which side you nursed on last. I am still using it and my little girl is over 4-months old now. It's small and compact and I take it everywhere with me.One more thing I used it to keep track of when she was first born was when I was taking 2 different pain medications every so many hours since I had a c-section. The less I needed to keep track of with as little sleep as you get the 1st month the better!
1,Not worth it if your baby TELLS you there hungry!!,"I got mines 2 weeks ago,and I have not really used it because,the baby tell's me when his hungry or in pain etc..so,it was worthless,I lost the orginal box so,I can NOT return it..If you get it wait TILL baby is born bc some babies do tell you if there hungry is high pitch cry and if there bored...they start kicking and playing with there hands etc...bunch of bs..having to own this piece of crap I plan on selling it on cragislist and see if I can get something for my money."
1,"Useless, Use a pen and paper instead","I was so excited to use this product because of the great reviews and it just seemed like a very functional gadget. When my daughter was born, I only used it to check the time. I recorded everything by pen and paper - the last time she ate, slept, pooped, etc. for myself as a reminder and to report to my pediatrician her activities. Plus, my baby told me when it was time to feed, when she pooped, when it's time to sleep again, etc... This item is useless."
3,Very Helpful,"It works well, and has been useful for keeping track of everything, the only negative is that the clip broke on the very first use."
2,Poor quality,"The clip that you would use to attach this to your pants, shirt, etc broke on us after being dropped onto our carpeted floor (from about 4 feet high). Disappointed in the quality. Does the job ok, but we found using pen & paper worked better for us as you could see the whole day, not just when the last feeding, diaper change, etc was."
5,Great product; this is our 2nd one,We purchased the blue one for our first son and loved it. It works great and does the remembering for you. We purchased the green one for our second son and so far so good. This is a great tool for busy parents and also helps keep your feeding/diaper logbook up to date.
4,handy item,"This item is handy for the first couple months. We used it mainly to time feedings and I used the L/R breastfeeding switch. Nice for the first bit when you are so sleep deprived and feeding so often! Not really a must have item I don't think, but I really used it a lot. Also, the flashlight button is nice for MON feedings!"
5,Perfect for Sleeplees Nights or any other time,"The timer is simple, hassle-free, and extremely helpful for what it is designed to do. One push of a button and the timer starts over. The indiglo backlighting is helpful for late-night viewing, the flashlight provides decent light without being too bright or concentrated, and my wife found the basic left/right tracker for breastfeeding useful. We have used the timer most for keeping track of our baby's feeding schedule. Sleeping and feeding tend to run together in the early days, and diaper timing becomes less important after the first week or ten days. I admit that having a counter along with the timers would be nice, but I am not sure if that could be added without depriving the device of its simplicity. Overall, it is hands-down one of the best baby products we purchased before the (early) arrival of our son."
3,wouldn't buy it again unless they upgrade it,"I was so excited about this item when I got it. It's come in handy at times, but overall it could be better. It is nice that you can just look at it for a quick reference, but it would be GREAT if it had some type of memory card to upload the data onto the computer for times, graphs, etc. It would be much more helpful if it saved at least a day's worth of history (the times that each button was pressed). Instead, I would press the button needed, but then write it down as well.Another con: it has a very short battery life in my opinion. I've had my Itzbeen for 8 months and I just changed the batteries for the 3rd time (and I very rarely -practically never- use the flashlight part).Pro: It's definitely helpful to pass between caregivers. Instead of having to give a run-down of when the baby was last fed, changed, etc; you can just refer to the Itzbeen for all of it."
5,GET ONE,"For the love of all that's holy.. j/k. But it really is essential to keeping your sanity. We set the ""max"" timers to our baby's schedule and changed it periodically as his needs evolved until he was 5 months old. Being able to check to see how long ""Itz Been"" since a particular need was met helped us figure out after many a sleepless night what his cries meant. (This is our first..) It is amazing how one forgets the simplest things such as ""it could be the diaper,"" after getting 4 hours of sleep a night for a couple months!"
3,Good if you don't need a log of events,It's great & in expensive but it must fit the needs of your wife & youHas no stop button just perpetual count on & start overWish I could mount in a visible stationary place above changing tableGood over all & ultra simplistic elapsed time counter & even settable alarm based on hitting a certain point in countBut you may wanna pair with journal for doctor infoBut great in the moment toolShould be 5 remotes that bluetooth to one recording device if they ever offer expanded model
1,Won't last long,"Would have loved it, but it's not rugged enough to survive being dropped, and let's face it... a sleep-deprived mom is going to drop it at least once. Was a great tool while it lasted. Now that it's stopped working it's just a waste of money."
4,Helpful & Nice little product,"My husband and I love gadgets so instantly we liked this product.Our son is now 2 weeks 2 days old. When we first brought him home, this was helpful until we got into a routine and for the need of tracking soiled/wet diapers and feedings. I was nursing so this helped remind us and helped keep track.I also keep a paper log because I want to keep everything recorded and have a history, so I don't use it as often as I did in the first week... but I still keep it around and use it from time to time.It will come in handy for when I need to give medications or something.On another note... Amazon's customer service is excellent. This item initially arrived with the clip broken and they sent me a replacement immediately the next day!! Because of their outstanding customer service (and great prices and shipping) I now turn to Amazon more and more!"
1,not working after 5 hours,"Update:I returned this one too, because the spring broke, and after that a handle broke.. Dohh.. quality is terrible..No more Itzbeen baby care timers for me!UPDATEI got a replacement and sent my item back. Returns are really easy. That's great! New item is working great until now (3 days)!original (5 stars):I like the idea very much - it's really hard to remember everything in first weeks/months - how long ago he ate, how long he slept.. it's important information! So I bought it! And few hours after opening a package Itzbeen the * and last bottons are not working. So sad!! I'm still using it, but be aware that Itzbeen bought in Amazon might not work, so better buy it in Walmart or somewhere you can return it easily."
1,Not an essential,"I thought this would be incredibly helpful once our baby was born, but ended up using the Total Baby app on my iphone instead. The app is much more user friendly with an intuitive interface. In contrast, I had to read the manual for the itzbeen twice and still couldn't make sense of it. I thought the nightlight would come in handy, but it is a glaring LED light that was disruptive both to our baby and my sleeping husband. There is a blue background light that's much more innocuous, but it only stays on for a few seconds at a time. Overall, I found this to be a non-essential item. Now I just use it as a clock next to the glider where I breastfeed. HIGHLY recommend the Total Baby app if you have an iphone, ipad or itouch!"
2,Expensive nightlight!,"I used this timer for the first few days with my newborn before realizing it doesn't keep track of the things you really need - if you are feeding your baby on demand, then you really should be keeping track of how many feeds and how many diapers, not the interval. I downloaded an app for my iphone for $4.99 which does all this and more, which if I had known earlier would have saved me some $$. I now use this as a nightlight because I have no other use for it."
1,Lifesaver while it lasted,"Greatest invention ever! It helps me and my husband especially to stay on track with feeding and diaper changes! Great buy!!!!Unfortunately after not even 4 weeks the device started to have issues. First one button stopped working and then one after another to the point where the device was no longer functional and programmable . We changed the batteries twice, but nothing helped! So it was great while it lasted! I now just use the timer on my phone. TIP: If you have an iPhone just download a free app which works just as well and seems to be more convenient!"
3,Still need a written record.,"I didn't realize the pediatrician was going to ask for detailed info on when the baby ate, how much, how many wet or poopy diapers, etc or I probably would have figured out that what we REALLY needed was a log sheet or book to record the info in. Yes, it's low-tech, but that way we have a few days worth of details to hand instead of just the last time we fed/changed him. I purchased this item myself because I thought it was such a must-have, but really.. not so much. Sure, it's handy, but not an essential."
3,good product if your baby sleep very well,"We used it for around two weeks. Then the baby's cry replaced it completely. The baby doesn't follow a time schedule. Unless your baby sleep very well, it's not necessary to use it."
4,Great for those first few weeks,"My son is breastfed and this was great to have in the hospital when the nurses keep bugging you about when you last fed your baby! It does not record how long the baby ate though so that was one thing I kept track of. I used this for the first month, but no longer use it. It did it's job when I needed it."
2,Kinda wack...,"Okay... when you first bring your baby home, the hospital breastfeeding consultants have you writing down everything. The tiime between diaper changes, wet and dirty, breastfeeding, then you may want to know how long the baby is sleeping, so this contraption seems cool. The internal light (blue) broke after a month, and by time the baby is a month old... these times are irrelevant. I still use the night light though."
1,Purchase an App instead,"I got this and used it for 2 months before discovering the iPhone app ""Baby Connect"" which does the same thing plus TONS of extra features.This app is $4.99 but it's worth way more! It tracks daily information about your baby: feeding (bottle, nursing, solid, pumping), diapers, sleep, mood, activities, milestones, health, medicines, vaccines, photos, and more. Several authorized users can be specified for each baby: parents, family, nannies, daycare staff, sitters, au pairs. Entries are immediately securely synchronized on each user account. Accessible with Baby Connect iPhone/iPod touch application, Baby Connect for iPad, Baby Connect for Android, or with a browser by logging to baby-connect.com. Hope this is as helpful to you as it was me!"
1,Why a gadget when u can get a app for that?,"My husband and I are gadget lovers, in fact this item is on my wish list but I will remove it. Last night I told him he should develop an app as a nursing log, and tonight I realize that actually there are a few. I just downloaded a free one that works on my iphone/ipad and does exactly what the itzbeen does but it does keeps a record, lets me imput whar breast or (if) bottle was used, what kind of diaper was changed and keeps a log of sleeping times. There several apps that work with android and even one free for any computer. Do not waste your money if you have any kind of smart phone or tablet."
5,The Pawn,"I bought this video and enjoy it tremendously. I would highly recommend it to anyone who likes dramas and suspense movies. It kept me rivited to my seat the whole time. I won't tell you about the ending, but its not what you think it will be. This is sure to be one of the best movies Greg Evigan has ever made."
1,It didn't work.,"I have a two year old Sony cassette player in my car. I tried my new Monster Cable Cassette Adapter with my 40 Gig iPod, and the adapter would not play in my Sony. The cassette player works fine with tapes, and just to make sure it wasn't the cassette player, I popped in tapes and they worked fine. After the tapes I tried the adapter again, but it would not work. I adjusted the volumes on the iPod and the cassette player. I tried a few other things, but I had no success."
1,TERRIBLE PRODUCT,I also bought this product because of the association with the Monster Cable name. I thought my stereo had gone out with the first listening. I didn't imagine that the adapter could cause that bad of a sound quality. I had a cheap one that fell apart after several years of use that was far superior. DONT BUY THIS THING
1,It's a Monster alright!,"So my Belkin iPod dock was annoying me with its random shut offs and rattling that often ripped my lighter port out of the case, I wanted a tape deck adaptor. Best Buy only sold one that I could find, and it was this. I'm thinking ""Hay Monster brand, can't be too bad!"" So I hook it up and throw it in. I ride a 96 Nissan Altima and at first it seemed okay. But within seconds the quality mimicked that of a beat up old record. So I tried it again and again assuming my tape deck was dirty. After reading all these horrible reviews I will assume it's just a piece of junk. Don't be like me, research before you buy!"
1,Monster was noisy and then broke,"Like the other reviews here, I was extremely disappointed especially since they typically put out decent quality products. I have a 97 4Runner and the cassette made loud noises for the entire (and short) life of the product. Don't waste your money."
1,Look into SONY,"Bought two of these - one for me, one for girlfriend. Neither one worked in any of my cars. What a disapointment from monster.Frustrated, I dug through some old drawers and found my Sony that came with a DiscMan many years ago. The SONY worked great! It was probably 10 years old.My advice, find an old one from a discman or look into other brands. Cassette adapters CAN work very well. The Monster does not."
1,"Audio quality good, mechanical quality poor","I bought a Monster cassette adapter for my wife. I already have one of another brand for my own car, and have been very happy with it, so I expected no surprises with this one.The sound quality was fine through the car stereo, but the cassette adapter made a loud clicking sound which was very distracting, and could be heard continuously over the music. I ejected the adapter and just turned the sprockets with my fingers, and sure enough, the interlocking gears in the adapter itself were causing the noise.I put it back in to the cassette player and fast-forwarded, rewound, and just let it run, to see if the mechanism settled into a different, less noisy position. No such luck.So back it goes.If Monster had paid a bit more attention to the mechanical quality of the adapter, I'm sure I would have been satisfied with it. But I will be purchasing a replacement from another manufacturer."
3,a loud cassette sound,"This product makes a lot of noise while playing in my cassette player - it is somewhat distracting. Other than that, the sound is good."
1,Didn't work........,"I thought Monster was the best until I bought this iPod Cassette Adpater - it didn't work AT ALL in my husband's 2001 RAV4. I thought the cassette player was broken until I read the reviews on Amazon. I immediately went to Walmart and Radio Shack where I bought cheap cassette adapters......they both worked - the sound is great, no extraneous noise. So beware, more money doesn't always mean a better product."
1,Not Worth the Money,"I just received this lamp, and - while it is pretty to look at - did not live up to its billing. It is not solidly-made, and is NOT made of glass, as advertised. It's o.k., but I should have spent the extra $100 and bought a quality product."
2,bad fit,"ordered size 7 for my daughter (her regular size) but they were to big (wide), then returned and re-ordered size 6 (and charged a re-stocking fee!) and they were still toooooo wide...but don't want to pay another re-stocking fee"
1,no sole and different with pictures about inside of shoes,These shoes have no sole like the pictures. They cannot be used out of door.And the inside of shoes are different(no suede insole).
1,Not for anyone that knows any other Unix based system.,"I bought this book to help me transition from HP/UX to Solaris. I hoped it would provide me with Solaris specific information for common unix administrative tasks.Unfortunately I was sadly disappointed. The book covers many topics but the information provided is so minimal as to be useless.For example the book gives you detailed information on what information is contained in sendmail packets, but doesn't tell you much of anything about how to install or configure sendmail.In addition there are many typos and errors in the book which is very distracting from the content.Over all I was very disappointed in this book. It provides a very high level overview for someone that has never used a Unix system before, but is definetely not for anyone familiar with Unix. ...."
5,Provocative. Excellence!,"The President of Queen's, Cambridge is to be commended for this masterful and unique attempt to reconcile the Apostle's creed with his scientific background. A tour de force in science, philosophy and theology indeed."
2,"nice, but not as good as other rubber maid organizers",This version isn't as customizable as the other rubbermaid sets. You have to setup the haning rails in a specific way to make this optimal. This would have been mutch better if it were similar to the smaller closet organizers
4,Wow!,"I bought pieces parts to do my first closet in my home and it cost me $90 for just 3 4 foot shelves. I bought this because of it's over all value. Even though I did not use all of the pieces (no clothes in this closet) it was a better buy to by the kit. I bought a second one for another closet because of how easy it was to put up. I did super saver because I could wait. It took only 36 hours for it to arrive. AWESOME! You def need two people to put this up. I did my small closet on my own, but I could not have done my big one without help. Highly recommend. It looks great.My only suggestion is to have the vertical supports, use different hardware. It suggests using toggle bolts which can be a pain to put up. I used plastic toggle bolts that I had left over from a previous project. My contractor said it was still as strong.Great product, fast ship, great price!"
5,Fred Kogos does Yiddish justice.,"The setup of the book makes it easy to use. The words and phrases are accurate; my native Yiddish speaking mother liked it. We were able to start talking and having fun right away. I was raised around Yiddish, but it hadn't occurred to my parents to teach it to their children. Love this book."
2,Controversial Art Needs More Than a Picture Book,"I have been following the work of many of the artists highlighted in this book for a few years now - specifically Damien Hirst. This had been one book I've had my eye on for a long time and I am thoroughly disappointed now having made the purchase. It is merely a picture book, sure; we ARE talking about the visual arts here. But if you want pictures: buy a poster, if you want information on the artists, their thoughts, their inspiration, their theory, their goal, their motives, their background; you still might be better off buying a poster - it's very likely it will contain more information that this book gives.For each artist there is a small paragraph at the end of the book, and other than that the only text is the introduction which talks about the hype surrounding the `young brit's' and some history of an average patron compared with Saatchi.An underwhelming book, unfortunately I have no other recommendations to look into on the young brit's."
3,Not all that useful,"I have given this a good test and I have to say I am not impressed. Even when I am very careful to hold it steady, the pictures are still fuzzy. The audio recording is not clear. The photos and videos are about what you would expect from a cheap cell phone. Each function works about as well as a single function product you would get for $9.95. It is a jack-of-all-trades, but master of none. On a positive note, if you consider it as primarily a pocket media player with all the other functions as free extras it is not a bad deal, but it will never replace your iPod."
5,5 Star Perfume,"I have several favorites among Estee Lauder, but this Beyond Paradise is really exceptional. Strange bottle holds perfume to take you to paradise."
1,Look elsewhere for technical info,"Perhaps some of the previous reviewers liked it because they use it for inspiration when designing at the very high visual level -- because really, this book is about pictures.There is no useful information in the book about the design or construction of green roofs (except a couple of pages in passing).Want to know more about how to design and construct using membranes, insulation, drainage, soil and gravel? Then look elsewhere.Want to know more about how to design and construct a green roof on a new versus and existing building? Then look elsewhere.How about planning the maintenance needed for a green roof whilst at the design and construction phase? Again look elsewhere."
3,Nice but not great,I bought this in hopes it would help with dark circles and fine lines but all it seems to do is moisturize. Bit disappointed in this especially after reading other reviews on it. I'm going to try Isomers R Pur for eyes next.
5,"Simple, fast and evereything fine. Great product, women satisfied!","Quick shipping, very fast. Very prompted!! It was a pleasure to deal with. Wonderful product and store. Thanks"
3,So useful...but gets groady. Not for college students,"I bought this to make loose leaf tea with (primarily thai iced tea). It worked extremely well and did exactly what I needed it to do. It provided plenty of room for the tea to move around and it also had a long net to accommodate steeping in larger pots.However it got really groady looking. Thai iced tea is bright orange and within a brew or two the filter was already stained. After a week or so it began developing dark spots around the net and I had to stop using it for fear that it was mold.If you do not have access to a dishwasher to dry the filter, than do not buy. As a college student, this is the problem I had and I would urge you not to make the same mistake.Find another solution for tea filtering, be it t-sacs or tea infusers.-Ross"
5,classical strings,"I hate changing strings on my Yamaha Classical, but I was very impressed by the sound that these strings put out."
2,You get what you pay for,"I was not happy with the sound of these strings. The EAD steel wound strings sound dull and the nylon GBE strings sound tinny. For an extra $2 I bought the D'Addario EJ45 Pro Arte and got a much, much higher quality sound out of my 40 yr old Yamaha G-60. Spend the extra $2 its well worth it."
2,God knows how useful it is,"If you do not know exactly what you are dealing with, stay away from it. should have come with one clubbed end"
3,re: Historical Fact,"I thought this movie was somewhat simplistic but entertaining. However, in response to the people saying it has ""no basis in historical fact,"" (especially William D. Shingleton) the massacre by the British is probably based on the Waxhaw Massacre of surrendered American militiamen by British troops under Banastre Tarleton, who is probably the inspiration for Col. William Tavington, the British ""bad guy"" in this movie. Tarleton was accused of massacring captured soldiers a number of times, and was said to ordered a dead American officer to be dug up, then forced the man's wife to serve him a meal. There doesn't appear to have ever been a massacre of an entire village as was in the movie, but this is a movie, not a documentary. If you don't mind some facts being wrong, this movie is an entertaining popcorn epic."
5,top notch,"This is a great film about the Revolutionary War, certainly on a level with Private Ryan as war films go. We see free blacks in South Carolina, a slave who wins his freedom by fighting the British (and then stays to fight as a free man), scenes seldom seen in American film these days. If you are a Southerner, it must be nice to see the South portrayed as something other than Satanic."
5,Great Movie.,"The Patriot is a really good movie. It's very well done, and the story is great. The cast is fantastic as well. Mel Gibson and Heath Ledger are awesome working together. The period in time is truly fascinating to me, and should be of some interest to every American who wonders about their country's past. The way this film intwines the war for freedom with personal stuggles that had nothing to do with war is excellent. The war scenes are captivating. It's just an excellently well done movie. Go Watch It...Now!"
2,Give me nonsense or give me death,"From a historical point of view, this movie is claptrap made worse by the grotesque superimposition of late Twentieth Century movie morality on the American Revolution."
1,Terrible pseudo-historical nonsense,"This is perhaps the worst film about the Revolutionary War ever made. I suppose historical accounts of British troops weren't scary enough for the producer, so he transformed them into anachronistic Nazis, burning townsfolk in their churches and summarily executing those suspected of disloyalty. The fictitious Benjamin Martin and his progeny are inflated with so much virtue, charisma and martial prowess that they overshadow the events surrounding them. The entire issue of post-revolutionary slavery and racism is whitewashed out of existence in a manner that would be silly if it wasn't insulting. Awful stuff, even if you intend to give the silver screen devil his due. Hopefully, true patriots can still THINK."
2,Another over dramatisation,Again we are hit with a movie that makes a convenient slant on history. This movie makes the British army out to be blithering idiots something far from the truth.This makes a potentially fantastic movie leaving you somewhat dissapointed when there was no need for it.Good actingGreat storyGood directingIdiot historian...
3,Historically innacurate movie. But pretty good story.,"This movie is perhaps about as accurate of a storyline as Titanic. But that doesn't mean its a bad movie. However, anyone who comes off believing it's accurate probably failed history class...It's kinda like how Elizabeth makes you all happy and googily that Elizabeth is this grand queen. (which she was) but other than that movie with Geoffery Rush... I seriously doubt I would have liked Elizabeth. Considering the English mistreated Ireland and Scotland.I found The Patriot to be more of a tear jerker than it needed to be. (Spoiler)Like who doesn't die in this movie. Mel's the hero and the kids dead... they burn his girlfriend. Mel's son's killed. It's really depressing. At least with Braveheart (another historically inaccurate movie) Sophie gets the good ironic twist.All mel gets is a new house."
4,Positive Proof the South Shared the American Revolution,"Probably one of the better American Revolution films of the last couple decades. Mel Gibson portrays South Carolina plantation owner Benjamin Martin who is reluctantly drawn into the conflict. His plantation burned and son murdered, Martin takes on the role similar to that of ""Mad Max"" as a one-man commando versus the British army. Later joining the regular Continental Army, Martin and his band win over the population and pin down the Redcoats in a series of hit and run engagements. Despite the screen-novelized drama and characters, the film is fairly true to the overall military action in the Carolinas. The South Carolina locations are gorgeous. The film has a 165-minute running time and is presented in wide screen."
2,Complete and Utter Waste of Time,"I am genuinely surprised at this movie's good rating!1)The historical innaccuracy is horrible2)It is a movie that glorifies the WRONG things about the American Revolution3)The love story is nauseating4)The characters are weak and underdeveloped. Mel Gibson is an ok (Just OK) actor. Most of the others are too, with some really really bad ones thrown in- just for kicks!5)People say it was entertaining- really? I was writhing through the entire thing. Oh, and the war scenes really aren't that gruesome... maybe its because I saw Kill Bill a month ago?I wish I didn't waste my time with this movie! Please, please watch something else! There are so many better (historical or otherwise) movies!"
3,Unoriginal But Entertaining,"Take Braveheart, Glory, and Gettysburg and put them in a blender. Voilla, you have the Patriot. This movie is not original in any sense of the term. It has what you expect: canons, killing, attempts of tearjerking, even a typical rousing soundtrack by John Williams. Do not get me wrong, this is entertaining. It is also trite and predictable. At least its better then most of the ""movies"" released this year! If you are a fan of Mel or the Civil War, buy it. Otherwise just rent it, save yourself some money."
5,VERY GOOD,This is one of the best movies of the year. It takes a lot for a 3 hour movie to keep my attention without running to the bathroom or going for a cig. I am very pleased with my purchas. You will not regret getting this one.
2,Repeat of Braveheart,"Mel Gibson is a respectable and talented actor. But the character he played was a spitting image of William Wallace. The portrayal of British officers was inaccurate and upscaled for hollywood sake. The storyline was OK, but the depth of the characters were too cookie cutter and unrealisitic. The setting, and the truth behind Mel's character was lost in translation. Too bad they tried to make another Braveheart. The first one was fabulous, the second was far from fabulous."
2,We deserve better,"This depiction of Revolutionary War figure Francis Marion has Epic written all over it - from its choice of Mel Gibson as its reluctant hero to its 2 hour and 45 minute length. The only problem is that its a bad movie - the characters are uninteresting and cartoonish and whitewashed to make it a ""feel good"" drama - how many times can you roll your eyes at its cliches, trite dialogue and sacharine tug at the heartstrings - well again, the movie is 2 hours and 45 minutes so the answer is Lots. While the director may have been attempting to make an action epic more on par with his other blockbusters - Independance Day and Godzilla - i feel this movie should be held to a higher standard unless you feel our nations history should be treated with the same level of gravity as aliens and giant radiactive lizards."
1,"A unrealistic, sterotypical mess!","This film is horrible, it is boring, unhistorical, and it is filled with violence as a substitute for a horrible story. I hope tyhe American public is not that shallow as to where violence can make up for a bad movie. It unrealistically make the English look like red monsters. Also to its unrealistic side, there is a scene where Mel Gibson and his two eight year old sons attack thirty English soldiers, and win. Now come one how can one man and two eight year olds, with single shot rifles easly defeat thrirty British soldiers?! The characters are stupid, the plot is stupid and the MOVIE IS HORRIBLE!"
1,worst movie of the year,"how can one movie be so bad? this movie is seriously in ""Armageddon"" territory. the dialogue, the character interplay and every single scene has been done so many times. the redneck racists being mean to the black man, who comes back with courage and dignity to ultimately win their respect. please, dont patronize me. this movie is what you get when you mix bad writing, bad directing and bad acting...well, you get the point. the only reason people compare this to braveheart is that gibson is in it. the movie is awful."
4,A decent movie on the American Revelution,"This was the first major movie on the American Revelution. The character Mel Gibson plays was actually Francis Marion ""The Swamp Fox"". The British commander Col. Tavington was actually Bannistre Tarleton, The Loyalist commander in South Carolina. The movie was inaccurate in some ways in its depiction of slavery, The role of African-Americans in the Continental and British armies, The non-existent role of Native Americans (particulry the Cherokees), and the role of Generals Gates and Greene. It did not cover the battles of Kings Mountain and Cowpens, which broke General Cornwallis' Western flank and drove him into North Carolina. It was a major accomplishment to bring this era on film."
1,Save us all,"Negative points: This was horrific. Yes, Yes, so the Brits colonised the US,the Patriot makes them appear as if they are, as Jimmy Price, rightfully put it, the Gestapo. I suppose the historical inaccuracies annoy me because i am a history fanatic but it doesnt stop there.Black people were made to look like subordinate fools in this film. The blacks in this film should be shot.Heath Ledger? Fool of the year. He was only in this film for his supposed good looks. He has proven nothing from what I can see.Positive points: The costumes were fantastic and who ever styled this film did their homework.Jason Isaacs. He is great. Paradigm of Evil."
5,The best movie!,(...) I can honsetly say this is one of the best movies i have ever seen in my life! =) We watched it in my social studies class. It is a sad movies and all of us were about to cry but we didnt. My teacher did though. It is like a must see movie! The are a couple really bloody parts but other then that it is great!!!!!!!!! I dont ever care about seeing blood so it wasnt bad for me but some of us it was. There was a couple of parts that i got grossed out by that involved swords but that was it. It is sad but it is funny to. WEll atleast for me it was.Hope this helped you to want to see it!!!!
4,if you can muscle your way through the historical blunders you got a good movie,"a very good movie about the creation of america.but the following are big blunders that make it not perfect.1. all of the men look away while firing ,this although was tought up to a piont,near the end of the war this was given up.2. the battle of the cowpens is very unaccurate such as the fact that no french took part in the battle(but its only based on the cowpens any way).3. all men march shoulder to shoulder , this was NOT tought by any side that late in the war.plus many other small things.overall its good put not accurate"
3,"Good DVD, Historically Garbage","The DVD itself is well done, but the story is completely historically inaccurate, which I disliked. Plenty of extra features, great soundtrack and visuals."
4,"Good movie, fictionalized history","For those of you who haven't realized it, this movie is very loosely based on the Revolutionary War exploits of Francis Marion, the Swamp Fox, a brilliant guerilla commander from South Carolina. The story is very highly fictionalized. The Mel Gibson character is the stand in for Marion and the Tavington character is based on Banistre Tarleton, ""Bloody Ban"", who terrorized American colonists from Virginia to South Carolina. There was no burning of a church with a number of colonists in it. The real Tarleton survived the war and went home to Great Britain. Marion fought in several battles including Camden and Eutaw Springs. After the war he married his cousin, served in the South Carolina Senate and died in 1795. Gibson's movie is great entertainment but very inaccurate history."
3,"Amazing movie, so so blu ray","Being a huge fan of the revolutionary era, I love this movie (and not for its historical (in)accuracies). Had to upgrade to Blu Ray of course, but was unimpressed. Its mildly better than the SD version, so I'd recommend buying only if you can get a good deal or if you don't already own the SD version."
4,Great,I read this about 3 years ago. AZnd i really liked it. I love reading about other cultures and their beleifs and metepsychics. It was very entertaing. If you have any intrest in Mind exploration then I recromend it to you
5,Fellini's Finest and Funniest,"Amarcord is a masterpiece. Filmed in the 50's, set in a small Italian town in the 30's, it Fellini's reminiscing on a year growing up in that time and place. It's a must see for any film lover."
4,a great Criterion Collection film. Fellini's youth revisted,"The film title means ""I remember"" This movie, filmed in Fellini's home town of Rimini is his depection of what he remembers of his own teenage years. In it we have a series of unrelated scenes which merge together to create a depiction of what life was like under Musollini's facist regime. It is a very interesting film with some humor in it. My favorite scene was when smeone had put a gramaphone (record player) in the bell tower of a local building and had ""Internationale"" playing on it! The police reaction is quite humorous. It is cool how the facists considered communism 'subversive'.Fellini said that is was based loosely on his own teenage years."
1,overrated italian fragmentation,"Call it what you like, but this movie is not the ""slice of life"" that many will attempt to push down your gullett. You have to dig deeply into your imagination to pretend to gain a semblance of significance while watching this one. If you want a storyline, or even a story with a purpose, forget it. If you want something Italian worth watching, go with Cinema Paradiso, Mediterraneo, or The Bicycle Thief. All of these are great movies, Amarcord is not."
2,No warning when the battery dies.,"I have 2. They worked great for a couple years but when the battery goes bad, It shuts off power to the computer even though there was no power failure. Wouldn't it be better to sound an alarm when the battery dies and leave the power on?"
3,just ok,Good:LCD can be rotated within unit for legibility.LCD makes nice blue night light.Seems to work with MAC OSX 10.4.9 energy control panel.Bad:Slow to recharge.LCD display not very informative as compared to APC units.No provision to turn off LCD backlighting
1,Stinks,"I have gone though three of these units in the last month, each one immediately gave out a very strong electrical/burning smell with in minutes of being plugged in.After the 3rd unit I gave up and bought another brand"
1,Not Worth It!!,"Totally my fault for not researching thoroughly, but this video is maybe 20 minutes and cost $20! I thought it was going to be about the breed...but it was mostly about Great Danes in movies...not informational at all. I'm sorry I bought it...there's better videos out there if you're looking for breed information."
1,Not worth buying CD!!!,"I have only two comments regarding this CD, firstly, recording is in monoaural,secondly very poor quality recording.If you're desperate to own this one,I advise you buy some other Kostelanetz CD album not this one,DEFINITELY NOT THIS ONE."
3,Disappointed!,"My children (5 & 6) and I were so disappointed! The artwork in this book was very pleasing, but the story just seemed so flat. The intended surprises were not very surprising, and the ending could have been predicted by anyone (even a chicken)."
2,Not a great rc,"This rc truck reacts to turning and forward and reverse well. However, the power is lacking to do any kind of climbing or real off roading. I would suggest a small gas powered over this one."
2,Nice feel but bad components,"I liked the feel of this mouse, but two of the micro-switches in it failed within the first couple of years. The first (left-click) failed within a few months. Being the enterprising type, I simply swapped it with the middle-click switch (which I don't use). Then that one failed some time later, and couldn't steal the button 4 and 5 switches, so it went in the junk drawer. One bad switch could just be a fluke, two indicates a junk product."
4,"On of the Best Electrics Out There, But...","You can just read the specs to see that this razor is in an ""elite"" class. With it's Lift-n-Cut system and high speed cutting, it will definitely give you a great shave. If money is not an object, then by all means slurge for this razor.But if cost is a factor, then ask your self if you really need all these extra goo-gaws on your razor. They are neat, but don't really give you a closer shave. If you don't mind a noiser and slightly longer shave, the lower priced Norelcos do nearly as good a job. Only a razor connosuier could tell the difference."
3,A useful starter book,"Although only 95 pages long, this book provides a useful primer for anyone interested in the Mauser Broomhandle Pistol. It provides both an insight into the history and development of the pistol, as well as useful information on identifying the different models produced."
4,Galuppi - Motets / Lesne Gens Harvey Il Seminario musicale Lesne,"Galuppi - Motets / Lesne Gens Harvey Il Seminario musicale Lesne is a recorded by Virgin Classics and starring Gerard Lesne, Veronique Gens and Peter Harvey. The orchestra part is played by Il Seminaro musicale. The sound quality is perfect and one feels as if one is listening to this recording live. Sylvie Mamy has written the liner-notes (Translated into English by Peter Vogelpoel). The lyrics are in German, English, Latin and French. Recommended. 4/5."
5,Simply the finest you will find,"It is difficult to appreciate with words, the overarching quality and class of Jake's establishment's in Portland.Having been to both, I cannot say enough. Orange roughy,so memorable that now, 6 years later, I can remember this particular dish. Anyhow, I've made the chowder from this cookbook, back when I was in Portland, and it was so fantastic that the we all concluded it was one of the finest dishes the palate could behold. Just unbelievable texture and flavor.Does anyone know the recipe for their chocolate torte cake?I don't believe they'll ever let that one out into the public domain, for the entire world would well go mad with joy.Perhaps we could use a bit of this just now. Buy the book!!"

3,A little to challenging for age group.,This is a pilates DVD that I could use as an adult and get a good workout. I thought it might be modified for a younger audience but it is really challenging. I have taken pilates classes and even in adult classes there are simple alternatives for beginners that were not included in this DVD.
3,Beautiful,"I liked the earrings the best. But since I returned the necklace and bracelet, I returned the earrings too! Maybe next time I will find a set that I like."
3,Mixed results,"The Motorola H9 is a slight improvement in sound quality over my previous headset, a Motorola H500. The H9 ear bud does seal out more of the ambient environment noise, but the highest volume levels of both appear to be identical and are still too low. I find the ear hook of the H500 to the ear bud of the H9 as a more secure way to wear the headset."
2,H9 Earbud Review,The ear bud is small and fits entirely inside the ear. This makes hearing in high noise backgrounds better than the outside ear buds. Downside is that the earbud is not held in place and fast head movement can result in ear bud falling from ear. Ear bud charging also requires a mini-tower which requires one more thing to be carried during travel. Audio quality is ok but rather tinny. It is a serviceable piece of equipment but not the breakthrough design I was expecting. Would not recomment
4,H-9,"Works well. Leaving it in the ear for a long period of time is somewhat annoying and somtimes you forget about it. It makes my ear itchy at times. Have to get used to using it. Otherwise, it works as intended."
1,Motorola Miniblue H9 Bluetooth Headset,"This item would not stay in my ear very well, even when it would it always felt like it was going to fall out. It was so small also that the buttons were hard to press to answer and cancel a call, when I would press it to answer or cancel it was uncomfortable in the ear."
2,Science Really Ain't Fair,"As a fan of dexter when i was young, i wanted to buy this game, true, i did enjoy it back when, but now i really look at it. There is one puzzle that can be extremely annoying in this game, there is no way to save your progress while doing one of the games. I still can not figure out one of the puzzles. But only one of them. If you're going to buy this, be sure to buy it used. It was not that enjoyable. The only things nice are the print station where you can print things, and the mini games, the main games are awfull, with one being so-so, but pitifull. All in all, as a fan of dexter, the print station is worth buying the game, otherwise, stay clear of this game."
2,The book has its own major 'GUI' blooper,"I pass the book around to people who are not in the UI field and point to one of the graphic examples in the book with the thumbs-down indicator. I ask them to identify what the author thinks is wrong with the item shown...and they can't answer.Why?Because the images lack short descriptions that explain their shortcomings to the casual reader. The author has failed to aknowledge the browsing reader (as opposed to the narrative one) and forces them to cross-reference the image id numbers against the narrative.Everything has a UI, even books, failing to address that in this one made for a poor first impression that makes it quite irritating in the long run.</rant>Overall somewhat long winded on some sections but useful for the novice."
4,Good encyclopedic reference,"This book is valuable for practitioners as well as students of mathematical statistics.The material is very perspicuously presented. The occasional ungrammatical sentence can be forgiven, given the width of the scope undertaken by the author."
4,One of the Best,"In the last ten years goth music has gone in many directions.. But what's out there for those of us who don't much care for all the changes? This cd is one of the few that retains what was promising about the genre. This band takes everything the genre has to offer and wraps it up in one tight package.. Lyrics, sound, aesthetic, etc.. it's all found right here. There is a lil Sisters of Mercy sound in a few songs but that's a good thing. If you're new to the ""goth"" thang.. this cd should be added.. 'Pictures of Betrayal', 'Dark Angel', 'Vampyres Cry', 'inside the devil' are just a few of the reasons why this is a must get.Rise is the next.. then stop there b'cause what came after these two cd's just wasn't the same..."
1,Poorly Written,"I found this book hard to read, and the examples provided in the book were not very helpful. I would not recommend this book unless you alreay have a good understanding a many of the behavioral concepts."
4,Good for Dmb fans,"I'm a huge Dmb fan. I've liked them for a long time and I was very excited that there was a book out about them. So me and my friend split the money to buy this book. He said I could read it first so I did. I thought this book was very informative and a good biography. It made me laugh, cry and want to listen to Dmb. The only complaint I had was she didn't interview the band. Other than that a great book for Dmb fans."
2,Not very good. Author never interviewed him.,"I am a very big of the DMB and was let down with this book. The author has never met Dave and therefore never interviewed him. The text in the book was all compiled from previously released material. I learned a handful of interesting facts about Dave and the band. The second half of the book was basically taking us from show to show. For some readers this may be enjoyable, but it becomes very repetitive. The main reason I purchased the book was because it seems to be the only one on the market about Dave and the band. The problem that arises when you don't interview the person that you are focusing on, is that a lot of the stories are here-say and perhaps false. I can't fathom writing a book about someone and not interviewing them. Overall, I would recommend it to an avid, hardcore DMB fan but be prepared for a big let down."
3,"not great, but informative","I feel that the book was not well-written because the author repeated the same information several times and it was basically filled with excerpts from other literature on dmb, such as interviews from different magazines and newspapers. I was a little disappoited that there was more information on the problems and lawsuits that dmb had to deal with than actual information on dave matthews himself...but that's just me... i would like to see even more books on dmb; i love them; they're the most ecclectic group of muscians I've ever heard!"
4,ransom,"ransom is a great book . I give it 4 stars becouse when you read it it is kind of scary and funny. What happens is there are these people named dexter,marine,jesie,gween,bruce. They all are coming home from school. THere bus driver is sick so this guy takes over , he kidnapps all the 5 children.He calls all there parents and says they all haft to give him 1000 dollers per kid. Some of the parents dont have enough money so they call marines parents and asked if they had enough money they said yes dont you she said no so they are working together to get the money. I think you should get the book."
4,Review Time,"I read Ransom, by Lois Duncan. The setting took place high in the mountains in a cabin. The main characters are Bruce, Dexter, Glenn, Jesse and Marianne. The book starts out as all five students are riding home from school on the bus, and the bus driver takes a wrong turn, he says that he's going to pick up a friend. A man in dark clothing gets on the bus, he has a gun and forces them to come with him to the cabin which he lives in high in the mountains. There they are held ransom, until each of their parents can pay the money that is asked of them. I liked the book, a lot because it was very suspenseful and had a lot of action in it. I recommend for people that like suspense."
2,boring,I bought this book because I read that Lois Duncan was also the author of I know what you did last summer. I was disapointed because hardly anything happened! There was only one exciting part in the whole book.
4,It's a really exciting book. But a little bit confusing,"Ransom is a really good book. I love books that keep you interested. Ransom starts off right at the begining with the story. It goes right into it. It has a lot of action, crime, and a little romance. It really goes into what people are feeling in family situations.I would definitely recommend it to anyone."
3,Ransom,"This book was enjoyable to me, but certainly not as much as her other books. To me, she puts in a lot of stuff she didn't need, just so the story would be longer. When I read it, I found the begginging dull, so I was tempted to not read, I didn't fully get interested till I was curious whether or not they would get free. I was also really excited about the part where they try to get free, and I was like, ""Leave, do it now!"" But, it's pretty obvious on how this story ends, so the ending was also lacking integrity, so I guess the only part of the story that I won't complain about, is the middle, when you see them go through panic, and you also get to see how their parents take this whole ordeal. So, if you're bored one afteroon, and have nothing to do, read this, but I would suggest something like, ""Stranger With My Face"", apposed to this."
3,Good Karaoke,"These Songs sounded ok. Not perfect, but whatever. There weren't enough songs on it though. They should have included more songs from the CD."
1,Not Impressed!,"The bubble gun is poorly designed, barely blows bubbles and DRIPS all over the place. Gave the item 1 star because the bubbles themselves are cool...save money buy the bubble refill pack and skip the gun!"
1,What were they thinking???,"I adore The Cure. They are great live or in the studio. Their songs have a uniqueness that cannot be heard in any other music. This tribute cheapens The Cure. It sounds nothing like them. It's not a type of music I enjoy. However, you must be your own judge. If you are a Cure fan, listen to some of these samples and ask yourself if they are at all like the original. I don't see how it would be possible for any true Cure fan to own this."
2,DISAPPOINTED!,"As an avid Cure fan for approximately 15 years, I was excited to find this CD. Unfortunately, after listening to the awful tracks, I wish I hadn't bought it. These bands obviously do not understand the music of the Cure - all of the tracks on the CD do not in any way capture the surreal essence of the Cure's music and lyrics. My recommendation? Invest in some more obscure Cure import CD's or singles, but please do not waste your money on this!"
5,Best bang for your buck,"These aren't the holy grail of drill bits, but they are the best bang for your buck you will see around! They work very well, and are very reasonably priced. Great for any amateur, or intermediate leveled person!"
3,Don't buy if you live in NJ!,"I give this product 3 stars because it is pretty decent quality. However, it's performance depends on where you live. In NJ, there is SO MUCH radio traffic that interference is unavoidable at least in my experience. I get static the majority of the time, even using the only open frequency I can find on the dial. I have managed to find a reasonably clean channel near work and another near home, so I switch channels during my commute (a very smart feature of this unit, I must admit). However, I almost ALWAYS get static with the unit. The static is not totally unbearable, but annoying. I'm sure this device is fantastic in less developed areas with less crowded radio dials."
2,Dont buy this if you live in the city.,"Love the design. Love the idea. Love the Price (compared to changing my stock radio to adapt to new technology). HOWEVER! this toy is a bad idea for people that live in big cities. I live in Miami, FL and I might get a clear channel for 10 to 15 minutes max! Im liable to get into an accident if i resort to switching stations on the transpod then switch stations on my radio to get another 10-15 min of clear sound. If i could turn back time id save my 70 bucks and wait till i had enough to upgrade my car stereo."
4,worked great while I was using it,I've had this product for a couple years now and it has been the BEST FM transmitter I Have tried and I tried them all just about. I think the Az sun got to it and my Display went wonky on me and wasn't display the numbers correctly but the unit still works.I have since upgraded to a head unit with USB port and Blue tooth thus eliminated the need for this transmitter
5,Great Product,"I read many reviews of many products before deciding on the DLO. I was skeptical since I live in Houston, TX with many FM stations, but it has worked great with minimal changing of stations. I even drove 700 miles last weekend and only had to change stations twice. The arm allows for flexibility when mounting, but can be a bit awkward. I love that it charges the ipod and the transponder runs off of the cars charge rather than AA batteries. Great product, would recommed to anyone."
2,distorted-transpod,"this product had promise.i purchased this item so i could use my ipod in my maxima and mdx.i liked the design, the mountining of the ipod was great. the problem with this item was the static.living in nyc you could never get a clear station,the reception would change from block to blockcausing loss of clarity no matter which frequency you went to.i think the transpod could not generate a strong enough signal to fight the weaker frequencies. the volume was also an issue (it was low)but if you cranked-up the volume on the radio it was ok. i thought this item was the way to go,but in the end the item had to go...i returned it"
2,DLO Transpod FM Transmitter,"After much review, I decided on the DLO Transpod FM Transmitter for my wife's car. The Amazon website indicated that this unit was compatible with my iPod Touch, however this was not true.When I received the unit, the setup was very easy & the sound was fine. Unfortunately, the device would not hold my iPod Touch when it was in its case, so that was definitely an issue. Also, once I plugged in the unit, the iPod displayed that it was incompatible & could not be charged via the DLO Transod.Overall, my issue is with Amazon & the incorrect description which I based my purchase on. The unit itself seemed ok, however be mindful if you have a case for your iPods as this does not seem like it will handle any units with cases."
1,Don't buy this...,I bought this as an option to play my ipod in my car. It wasn't a good buy and didn't work well. It also didn't really fit nicely into my cigarette lighter so I don't use it at all.
2,Sucks for Video Ipod - bad fit,"First, the packaging is that plastic crap that you run the risk of amputating a finger removing, but most of manufactures use this nazi torture invention so I guess they can't be completely faulted, but they put the manual in the top flat part, so if you cut where you imagine you are missing the device, you may be unlucky like me and cut your manual in half.Then, you remove the little adapters they have for the other smaller ipods, and find out that the 30 GB video Ipod rattles around and is only held in by the connector. It can bounce around and clatter - not a snug fit at all. I found myself saying, POS, POS, POS the whole time working with it.I haven't even tried to see if it actually works in the car yet."
4,Great,"I like this item because it is not only an FM transmitter, but also a charger for the iPod. I recommend this item!"
2,Would Not Recommend,This was the second transponder I bought for my video iPod. I liked the idea of the adjustable arm to keep the screen in view and reduce wires. Other than that feature this thing was horrible. Station settings did not go below 88.1 and the static was unbearable. Once stations were found they did not hold and I had to constantly move chanels. Not real safe when driving. Took this back and bought a Kensington Digital Transponder/Charger which works awesome.
5,Why a loser?,Excellent is the only word appropriated to this book. I'm a female French student who found this book by chance and who immediately had the idea to do a research work on it.But why should James be a loser; why not a winner. I almost wanted to cry by the end of the book.
5,Brilliant but so very Dark,"Golding's novel is gripping, like a catastrophe happening in slow motion. His cynically humorous exploration of the London's queer netherworld is gorgeously wrought. Nostalgic reflections of childhood and adolescence are painfully interspersed with intrigues and betrayals. While the protagonist/narrator is sympathetic (if prematurely jaded), I'd like to have kicked his behind a few times during the course of the book.Read this if you long ago realized ""boy meets boy"" is no longer adequate reason for a novel. The prose is stellar and the author's verbosity a pleasure. Detail piled on detail create a relentess dissection of current gay (post-gay?) urban culture. The reader must be patient, though. This novel is not for the hurried - or the delicate for that matter."
5,Must Read,"This book is a must read for teachers, therapists, and anyone who works with children--especially damaged children. The educational approach is fascinating; the description of the boy's experience is touching. Just for clarity, this is a book for ADULT readers, not for children. Gerstein wrote a picture book on this subject (THE WILD BOY) which is appropriate and enjoyable for children."
4,perfect for the price,"I like it, although the timing is hard to perfect to get the perfect medium soft egg for me.I heat it up for 6 min (4 eggs) in the morning, and leave it in the microwave 'til I get off work, and they're a good medium consistency (the yolk).For $9.99 I really can't complain."
5,Does exactly what it says it will do and does it well. Easy and convenient!,"Great product that does exactly what it claims to do. Makes soft boiled and hard boiled eggs well. Just fill up the bottom half of the ""egg"" to the fill line, add one to four eggs in the tray, place the top on, and pop it in the microwave oven. Extremely simple and convenient. No need to waste time boiling water and prodding eggs in a water pot.A few things. The egg boiler doesn't do soft boiled that well. I like my egg whites to be firm but the yolks to be runny. At shorter cook times, the white will be somewhat runny alongside the yolk (making it harder to peel as well). Also, I find that you should lower the microwave times that are recommended if you have a newer, high-wattage microwave.Otherwise, a great product. I bought one later as a gift. Makes a great one for someone on a diet or is a vegetarian. Eggs are nutritious and have been demonized for no reason. Eat the damned yolk!"
3,gets too hot to handle,"Good for hard eggs, but difficult to get soft eggs. I like soft eggs, but even 5min in the microwave gave a hard egg white with runny yolk. Some people might like this kind of eggs though. Maybe I'll try 4min next time. My main problem is that i burn my fingers each time I use this. It gets so hot I have to use mittens to get it out of the microwave, and it's almost impossible to pry open the lid with mittens. They say you're supposed to let it cool, but it takes a long time to cool, and I want to run the eggs immediately under cold water so they don't overcook."
5,Perfect,"Works exactly as described. I've tried every combo of salt, cold water baths, old eggs and vinegar on the internet and not one consistently yielded peal-able eggs. This thing is perfect! The instructions have 3 common wattages of microwaves and they are very accurate -- worked just right on the first try in my 800 watt microwave. The eggs peal perfectly every single time and the yolks are never green unless I forget to take them out and put them in cold water to stop the cooking process. Be careful removing the whole thing from the microwave -- the water is somewhat close to the rim and will burn you if it sloshes out."
3,pop top,I like the cooker except the top keeps popping off. The eggs are cooked o.k. except some eggs are cracked and once an egg exploded and the top blow off and got egg all over the microwave.
1,No microwave cooking time table on the product or on manufacturer's website,"So I had this thing lying around, and then I decided to use it to boil some eggs.Problem is, I don't have the instructions manual any more, so I don't have the table for the microwave times, and don't know what cooking time to set on the microwave.I really wonder why they did not just print the microwave cooking time table right on the product. Seems like a very obvious thing to do. Makes me wonder what these people were thinking. Or perhaps such a feature is patented already??So I went to the manufacturer's website at (...) hoping to find the instructions manual there in PDF format. No such luck."
5,Now the kids can make their own eggs!,"I just love this egg cooker. My kids love hard boiled eggs, but I hate the work. Now we're both happy! It's so simple the kids can make their own eggs. It does get hot, though, so make sure your kids are old enough to handle hot things with care. Perfect for anytime you want 4 or less eggs. Still have to do it the old fashioned way when you want to make more."
2,Ehh,Found it easier to boil my eggs in water. After the first time I used it a plastic ring separated off the product. Not really my thing sorry to say.
5,Fool-Proof Hard Boiled Eggs,"Experimented on time with my microwave(1100 W),found 8min 45 sec to make perfect hard boiled eggs. They peel perfectly, no lunar lanscape on the eggs. Also use tepid tapwater in cooker. I would recommend this egg cooker to anyone."
2,Stopped working?,"We were very happy with this product initially (it made awesome hard-boiled eggs), but after a while eggs started exploding. I am talking about a real explosion with the microwave door blasting open and egg splattered all over the kitchen -- my spouse is incidentally cleaning up the latest (and last) of such incident.Given the simplicity of the contraption, how can this happen? Premature plastic aging?"
4,Hard-boiled eggs any season? Yes please!,"I used to think it was a pain to cook hard boiled eggs, especially when it was just for a couple at a time so I really didn't eat them often, just Easter, really! Well, this little device has changed all that. I can cook from one to four at a time and in about 8 minutes I have a hard boiled egg with little cleanup. I've owned this for almost a year now and use it a couple times a month and have had no issues. I was hesitant to buy it because I wondered if it really worked but I'm here to say that it does and I am very happy with it. It takes some getting used to for opening it and moving it (especially once it's done getting cooked because the base with the water in it is very hot!!) but for now I'm happy with it."
4,Could Not be Easier,This egg cooker makes the cooking of hard boiled eggs error free. The traditional method of boiling always yielded mixed results. It makes the right number of eggs for two people per cycle. If you needed a greater number of eggs then repeating the cycle will yield the results. The cooking instructions are straight forward and to the point.
4,It does work!,"Bought it for my friends Mom who recently blew up her microwave attempting to cook some eggs. She gave this a try (after alot of encouragement) and says it worked just as promised, she's so happy!!! Thanks for a wonderful product!"
5,So Easy!,"Ok, I know hard boiled eggs are so easy to make, but I fell for the draw to buy this microwave egg boiler anyway. I'm so glad I did since it's so much easier to cook a few eggs for my salad or for a quick meal using this tool. It goes faster and I don't have to be watching it to make sure it doesn't boil over or cook too long. The first time I used it, I had to experiment to see how long my particular microwave needed to cook the eggs the way we like them. It takes exactly 8 minutes from cold and then I leave it sitting for two minutes and then finish cooling them under cool water from the tap. Easy!"
2,"It was great while it lasted, then it blew up and made a huge mess","I had owned this for a few years and been very happy with it when a massive EGGSPLOSION happened last night. I heard a boom, went into the kitchen, and saw that the microwave door was open and there was mostly-cooked egg all over the inside of the microwave. So, I had to throw out the whole contraption and spent the next hour cleaning the microwave and coping with the smell. I gave this product two stars instead of one since I had liked it so much until this happened. Too bad..."
3,egg cooker,Have tried it a couple of times and each time one or more of the eggs are underdone. The rest are OK.
1,MICROWAVE DIED,"Like others found, the thing exploded. After the second or third explosion, the microwave died. I have no scientific evidence to pin this of the cooker, but I'm afraid to ever use it again."
1,DANGEROUS!,"The idea of this product is good and eggs are cooked well. However, the design is very poor in regard to the user safety point of view that makes this product dangerous for a user.After being cooked in a microwave, the external surface is very hot and slippery. The upper cover got to easily stack to the lower part. I had a hard time to open this cooker as its smooth surface had no features to grab it and swing open, particularly with a paper towel. A boiling water inside of this cooker can be easily spilled on your hands. I had to cool down the cooker under cold water before opening it and getting the eggs. That precautions make use of this cooker longer and messier and way more dangerous than a conventional cooking in a pan.Stay away from this product."
1,timing eggs,it exploded the eggs all the mictowave at 8 min at 6 min they boiled out of the shell and the egg shells burned. at 4 min they were under cooked for hard boiled. that was my doz eggs ate none will try it again I would love it if I can get it to work
2,NOT MAC COMPATIBLE - must own a PC,So aggrevated there aren't more voice recorders on the market that are mac compatible like those that are pc compatible! The direct USB is a nice feature but you HAVE to have the software installed on your PC in order for your computer to even detect anything is plugged in. Argh. I wouldn't have bought this item if I had read these Amazon reviews first. There is guaranteed a better product all-around for your needs.
4,addictive,"i have played the previous title of Caesar and enjoyed it a lot. But, this series of Zeus and Poseidon hooked me totally. Not only is it a better city building experience but also the scenarios are much better. The ability ot mingle with heroes, gods, monster, etc. Simply superb.You will start playing in the evening and realise it is 4am and you have to get some sleep. The graphics, sounds are very apt. On the humorous side are the names of the citizens, workers, soldiers, etc.They are names of famous people tweaked to sound greek. Cant give it 5 stars because it makes me avoid my real life."
4,Surprisingly Good.,"What's interesting about solving murders that long ago when we've come so far with our detective stories? Everything, that's what. Superior acting, beautiful photography with each frame like a painting, unusual cases for our doctor sleuth to solve. It took about two episodes to get me hooked, but hooked I got. I wish there were more Anno 1790s to look forward to but alas, it seems these 10 were it."
4,Georgeous tunes lovingly performed!,"These bands are obviously big King Crimson fans. Their performances are inspired, and as all Crimson fans should expect, the compositions are superb!"
3,Better Red than Dead,"There's nothing wrong with this album. A good song is a good song, and hearing a cleaner version is refreshing. Like early Genesis, the sound qualty of the (KC)originals leave a bit to be desired. I play CD's for 9 hours every day at work, and I can truly appreciate not having to change the volume every song. And you MUST buy the album 'SIX' by MANSUN. It's life-shattering. No, it really IS that good. If you don't like it, I'll buy it off ya... =B="
4,Awesome gloves - combat real or airsoft,"These are solidly done. Love the features - padded tops of the fingers, grippy fingertips, great dexterity. Good in actual situations or even for airsoft.The only drawback I found was a small amount of stitching came undone after a short time.Sizing is close - yet for a size 9 hand (med) - I think the large would have done better for me."
5,Caboose is a great option,"We travel a lot with our 2.5 and 1 year olds and always bring it along. It carries our kids safely and isn't much heavier than an umbrella stroller; perfect for air travel. We just visited Thailand on holiday, which is not the friendliest for strollers - lots of uneven pavement plus it rained the whole trip. The caboose and dry and snug rain fly kept the kids dry and the stroller held up to four days of rugged Thai roads. Really sincerely impressed."
3,Great idea but still needs some work,"This is just what we were looking for except for a few things...1. On-board storage is minimal. The basket is only rated at 5 pounds. Who goes on a walk only carrying 5 pounds with two kids? I was thinking that we would use this to walk downtown or to the park. I need to carry water, snacks, a diaper bag and clothes for if it gets cold. All that adds up to about 15 pounds. I have to carry a backpack to make this work.2. I am 6'2"" and the handle bar is just too dang low. If I don't walk with my arms fully extended my feet hit the rear footplate. An adjustable length handle bar would correct this.With those two exceptions I like this stroller. We will how long it holds up to two children 3 and a half years apart."
2,not as great as I thought it would be:(,"I was looking for a stroller that I could carry a 8 month old and 18 month old. The back is uncomfortable and the 18 month old doesn't like it. But, I will say they said it was for an older child in the back.... But, its bulky and heavy to lift in the car and its wider than my car so its a bit difficult to put in. I have a Mazda prodege wagon... The lower basket is hard to get to to put your things... the hood gets in the way... I was disappointed:("
4,Great Purchase,"I purchasded this for my 2 1/2 yr old and our upcoming trip to Disney World. Last year we took an umbrella stroller and he hated it - he really wanted to see everything and coudn't. The beauty of this stroller is that the child gets to decide how he wants to ride - sitting on the bench, standing on the step, or lying down if he's asleep. I've been using the Joovy Caboose for a couple of weeks now and my child absolutely adores it. He gets very exited to ride on his ""big boy"" stroller. It was easy to assemble - did it by myself in about 15 minutes. The materials are good quality and easy to clean. I am also rather tall, and the height of the handle is perfect. The stroller is not really hard to maneuver, considering that is is a double, and is very nice looking (exactly like the picture). The only thing I am a little dissapointed about is that it is very, very heavy and hard to collapse for storage. Overall, great purchase and highly recommended."
4,Joovy Sit and stand,"I bought this stroller because it's smaller in length than the other Sit and Stand strollers out there.(It's very compact) I also have a two and a half year old and a 9 month old. Which makes this stroller ideal. I love most everything about it the only exception it that it is very heavy. Try the newer ""light weight"" sit and stand by Joovy. It might be lighter."
4,Strengths and Weaknesses,"I have a 4 year old and a 6 month old. The tandem stroller works well when I have to take both of them out together to a place (Like a mall) that requires some walking. The 4 year old seems to like it! The downside is that it is heavy and clunky and hard for me to get in out of my SUV. Also, my little one is still in her infant seat, so when my older one wants to sit in the back seat, it is on a slant and not comfortable for him. Once she is sitting in the regular stroller seat, he will be more comfortable. Also there is little basket space underneath and no cup holder for her bottle. I'm still glad I bought it!"
2,Not what I was expecting,"I have two boys ages 4 and 2.5 years. I purchased the Joovy Tandem in hopes both boys would be comfortably transported. The stroller is heavier than I expected- mainly because it is very sturdy, very solid. The footrest for the forward riding child is much too short for my 2.5 year olds legs. His feet hang over and get caught on the wheels. I tried placing the footrest in the up position, but it is easily moved back down- by my toddler! He figured out how to move the footrest the first time he rode in this stroller. This was not what I was expecting. It also takes up a tremendous amount of space in the back of our vehicle (a mid-size SUV). I had to remove the canopy to get it to fit in the cargo area."
1,Poorly designed,"We just finished putting this stroller back in the box to return to the store. After speaking to a customer service rep from Joovy, I am even more disappointed. Our toddler is unable to sit in the back seat when the infant car seat is installed properly. When I asked their rep about this, he responded that kids were ""malleable"" meaning that my daughter would adjust to having to lean forward. Obviously he does not have kids. The rear seat also slides back and forth and does not have a locking mechanism. We have four children and have been through many strollers. The concept was what attracted us to this stroller but their design needs work!"
5,"Great Stroller, works with new Graco Safe Seat!","I love this stroller! My second baby was born three weeks ago, I called the company this week and asked why the stroller was not approved for the new Graco Safe Seat. They told me that it was just approved to take this new car seat! The red and gray safe seat looks great when used with the stroller. I highly recommend this stroller to anyone."
4,vey satisfied,"it is a very good product for the use it is designed for. i bought it now that I have 3 kids. when the 2 of them are on it, our walk is very pleasant. the plus is i can use it also for the new born using the carseat. the old one has also the opportunity to rest whenever she needs. the truth is that it is a bit heavy for me to push but everything has a ""cost"". overall very satisfied with this stroller and gad i bought it."
4,Love it!!,This stroller is great. I have a 3 month old and a 4 yr old. Very easy to use and rolls great!!
3,Good start but needs some redesigning,"I started out loving this stroller (I have a 7 month old and a 2 1/2 year old) but after taking it on vacation, I returned it to the store. Here's why...neither child can take a nap in it. the one position recline for the front seat is useless(less than 45 degrees). There is no way for the baby or the toddler recline. My 2 year old loved standing on the platform but wanted to sit in the front when he got tired. He didn't like that the little seat slid back and forth. He ended up sliding off the seat often. The storage net might as well not exist as it is impossible to access and the foot rest in the front seat is too small for a two year old (28lbs) it scraped him in the back of the legs. The idea of a ride-on is fabulous, but not being able to recline and take a nap is (for me) a deal breaking issue. Also, this stroller is deceptivly heavy for it's small size. Very hard to travel with."
2,Came with a hole in it,"These gloves are inexpensive, but they're also cheap. They came with a hole already in one of the fingers on the seam. I don't expect a lot from costume gloves that are this inexpensive, but I also don't expect them to be that faulty. It's not a huge deal, as I can sew them, but really. They are adult size but are kind of small for many adult hands, especially males. Other than that they are really just basic white gloves. I imagine they'd serve your purpose as long as they arrive without a hole in them."
1,Unlucky Reader,"This assemblage of stories about spoiled, vapid, and, worst of all, utterly ulikable young American females abroad is a shining example of how mind-numbingly poor Nell Freudenberger's writing can be. Reading her prose is like listening to a 17-year-old girl on the telephone with her friend -- a rampage of dead-end discussions and trivial details. Freudenberger throws around enough foreign words and phrases to lend to her excruciating tales the air of ""diversity"" required of any young author who wants to win awards and endorsements from the creative-writing-department Gestapo. This book is a pointless mess and a waste of time."
1,Can't understand the hype.,"I gave this my best shot, but was left feeling cheated, after all the buzz surrounding this author. These stories feel like practice exercises for a Creative Writing 101 program. Can someone explain to me why she got such a big advance?"
1,Lucky Girls - But Lucky at What?,"I read the book based on a strong review, but I was greatly disappointed. The stories are all well-written, but after each one, I wondered what I had read. What was the point? What was the author saying? The stories seemed to be about spoiled girls from comfortable families just going aimlessly through life. The girls had no goals, so they could not be faulted for making no effort to reach them. A total waste of time."
1,Overhyped and lame--don't waste your money.,"There are 1000 books like this that come out of M.F.A. programs every year in this country: totally solipsistic, self-indulgent fiction--and that this has gotten media attention is what the title says: lucky. Rich pretty white girl goes abroad etc. Spare us, please!"
4,amethist earrings,"These are beatuiful, but they are a little larger than I expected them to be so they hang down from my lobes."
5,Great product for the money,"My Husband works overseas, so I purchased a phone for both of us to use with Skype. I was amazed for the price, how good the sound quality is. We are both very satisfied with the product and highly recommend it to someone who is looking for a good USB phone, but is not wanting to spend a lot of money."
5,Great movie,"Follows the story line and gives a bit more depth to who Po is. Great movie, watched it dozens of times with my kids."
5,Fun for all,My grand children and I thoroughly enjoyed the DVD. We watched many times while they were here.They said they have it at home and they love it.
3,"All Potential, but Afraid to Show Heart","There are few movies in general, and perhaps even fewer animated films with the right balance. Kung Fu Panda 2 is certainly not one of them. The problem with this film is that it's trying too hard to be funny, and comes across as irritating and goofy instead. There are several scenes where there are opportunities to show emotions, but they are quickly turned into stupid jokes. It's worth seeing, but don't expect a masterpiece, and it's definitely not Oscar material, despite being nominated."
5,One of our favorites,"My kids have quite a collection of movies, as we travel a lot and there is a player in the car. That said, Kung Fu Panda movies are our families favorites. We love Jack Black, and the moral and spiritual undertones of these movies. Kung Fu Panda 2 is, in my opinion, better than the first one. That's saying a lot for me, because I LOVED the first one. My four-year-old could watch this and the first Kung Fu Panda every day, if I would let him. He loves the main character ""Po"". It is extremely funny and very up-lifting. Anybody who hasn't seen the Kung Fu Panda movies is seriously missing out on two great flicks. All of us love this film and that includes, my husband and I, and four kids; ages 4 to 15."
4,Kung Fu Panda 2,Good movie enjoyed by my 13 and 14 y/o children. They found it entertaining and they said it would be worth watching again.
3,Kung Fused,"While the sequal is good it is not close to being as good as the original. Furthermore it seems in the end that this is the second installment of a trilogoy. Overall quality of the film is excellent, the scenary is lush and colorful, but the story line is lacking. The other master ku characters, a croc and ox, seem out of place and an afterthought to the story. Much of the humor and playfulness of the original film is missing.I hope that the third installment (if there is one) will get back to the roots of the original."
3,Live tracks: OK; New tracks: The best YES in years!,"Disc 1 consists of live tracks from the SLO concerts. No big surprises here, although it is good to hear some of the YES classsics in cleaner, fresher live recordings. As with most live recordings these days, these tracks are probably heavily overdubbed and edited.The big news is the new studio tracks. Mind Drive is a 20-min. long piece in the classic tradition; excellent! The shorter tracks are great too. They sound fresh and have some nice changes and progressive elements.The only criticism I have about the new tracks is Rick Wakeman's keyboard parts. They sound like he phoned them in. And actually that is about what he did; the rest of the band left holes for him to fill in. His playing sounds trite and uninspired; like he hasn't gone beyond 1976. He has now left the band and I think they are better off for it.The other surprising thing is how different the new tracks sound from the Open Your Eyes disc released within a month of this one."
2,Bad paint job,"The plastic chips are nicely textured, butthe dots are partially painted and paints appear faded.Maybe this is for the antique look.Maybe it is just poor quality construction. Hard to tell."
4,A Great Resource,This book added more insight to the skills I have been developing in graphic arts. It will make a nice resource.
4,Good book with much to offer,"This text has some good assignment merit and can be a great tool if supplemented with outside materials. It is well written, easy to read and covers the elements of design in a logical way. If you are a teacher like me, this will be a good resource/ idea book to jump-start your lessons and planning."
1,terrible,"i own over 30 graphic design books. i had high hopes for this one because of hte positive reviews, but it is not nearly as good as the majority of GD books that i have, plus the price is so much higher than any of the better ones!this is the first book i have every returned to amazon because it was so terrible. buy graphic design books by lupton or landa instead. they cover the same material, and more, and they are much better."
3,Law in Social Work Practice,Book is well written. Cases cited are relevant and current. Examples given for clarification and comprehension.
3,How dogs think,"I was utterly bored stiff with the first half of this book. I am glad I hung in there & finished it as the second half made it worth while. Of coarse I was raised around dogs & they have been in my life forever...so the 'ground work' of the first half I felt ""I"" really didn't need....but would be necessary & useful for most people. Not to say 'I know it all', but have earned a lot of knowledge over the years of joy & heartbreak.Sincerely John Steen Sr."
1,Are they serious?,C7 LED replacement bulbs should cost no more than $1 each. Charging 3.49 is criminal.
2,This is not the real thing,"If you're looking for a definitive Vibrators CD, this ain't it. This is a typical Cleopatra job chock full of live versions, b-sides, and demo versions. Because they don't own the rights to the originals, they release this shabby excuse for a ""Best of..."" Do yourself a favor and get either the real ""Best Of"" (formerly titled ""Batteries not Included,"") or the ""Independent Punk Singles Collection"" on Anagram. Hell, even the recent live album is better than this. A ripoff no matter how you look at it."
4,4 1/2 Really.. Very good - Just a bit different..,"This release is very good in its own right, It's no ""Dreams of a Mad King"" though.. As others have said, this is a bit darker than ""Dreams"" and though thats certainly not a bad thing - it's just not what you might expect if your a fan of their first release.Without expectations of more songs like were on the ""Dreams"" CD it really does grow on you though. For me, ""Eyelash"", ""My Last Breathe"" ""Secret Desire"" and ""Black Water"" are the standout tracks (In that order too)Overall, if you like Big Electric Cat - of course give it a shot. If your specific to the sound of ""Dreams"" though, it might not be your first pick. New to BEC? Go for ""Dreams of a Mad King"" instead - Definitely their better release."
5,A great movie for all ages!,"This movie was one that really got you thinking. These kids could have spent all the money that they found on themselves, but the kids did not. Brad and Frankie did what all people should do in this case. Help the people that really needed the money!"
2,"an introduction, but not much more.","If you already know something about loaders and linkers, then this book is not for you. It covers the basics, but then it stops just when things are getting interesting. The book describes several executable file formats, but it always stops just when the topic is becoming interesting. In summary, a decent introduction, but not much more."
5,Waterford Silver Star Ornament Stand,I love it. They are very study and they display my ornaments very well. I bought 3 of these and am very pleased with my purchase.
5,Awesome game...addictive!!!,"Fusion Frenzy 2 is a very addictive, glued to the television game. I played it somewhere else and I knew I had to have it. Its even more fun and exciting when you have all four people playing. You just can't stop playing it."
5,Great fit!,"Fits great, looks great, easy to clean. Replaced my carpet mats for these... TOTALLY AWESOME. Love that I can spray them out if anything spills."
1,"High price, low quality","I initially thought this was a high quality stroller, however, having used it now for only three months, two components have broken, rendering the stroller unusable. One of the faux aluminum (but really plastic) legs broke, as did a plastic switch to release the control to fold the stroller. I guess if it didn't fall apart so quickly it would be a reasonable stroller, but the quality is simply unacceptable."
4,poignant glimpse into an unknown world,"This text has a series of images and text that give the reader some insight into the lives of child prostitutes who live in Brazil. Whilst this book does communicate the tragedy and sadness that accompanies abject poverty, it is also careful to allow its participants to be read as more than mere victims of paedophilia/capitalism, but also human beings with a sense of agency, in an environment who face a myriad of potential problems e.g. violence, abuse, poverty - yet still manage to retain beauty, humanity and a sense of hope and happiness. This book is a testimony, not only to the disturbing underside of capitalism and desire, but also to the ability of the human spirit to endure such trials."
5,Great product!,I have been using nia for about 3 weeks now and I have noticed my face appears smoother and more vibrant! Highly recommend!!
4,A Good Buy,Very nice jeans. Wash separately or with other jeans-the color runs for the first 2 or 3 washings. Hold their shape well. Fit well & are comfortable. Don't know how they will hold up in the dryer as I don't use one. A good buy!
1,these jeans are awful do not buy,These are the very old style that have so much starch on them they can walk by themsleves! You will not like them
1,I won't buy anything promoting animal cruelty,"I had two pair of these in my shopping cart, but then read the description more carefully - these are endorsed by the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association. Animal cruelty is an important issue to me, and I won't buy anything with such an endorsement. While this review does not speak to the quality or fit of the jean itself, it absolutely speaks to recommending to buy this product or not, and I want to make sure this endorsement is noticed by anyone that would factor this into their purchase decision."
4,"Wrangler Men's Cowboy Cut Original Fit Jean, Rigid Indigo Denim, 32x31","This jeans is really a good one, but not really to be worn during the summer because it's really tough."
4,A good product with a minor stitching problem.,I like the fit and feel of the jeans. Overall I think they are a great product and will be getting another pair.The only problem is a slight problem with the stitching on the left front pocket. I will closely check the next pair before I ware and wash them.James Pierce
1,first one no good,the first one that i received was no good the positve loop had no current path.it was replaced and the new one works fine and it had been replaced at no additional cost
3,White writting is on the Negative (-) wire!,"So the product works great once its connected properly. Installation itself is easy, just strip and crimp. The things is that the the only differentiation between the wires is the white writting on one. I could be way off base here, but in my expereince the writting typically designates the (+) possitive wire.So when I hooked this up the first time I wired it as such, insterted my phone power adapter and promptly blew it out ($20) down the drain.Lesson learned: always use a multitmeter to figure out which cable is which. In this case the wire with the writting on it is (-).I have since installed several of these for friends to have a hardwired cellphone power cable that is hidden behind the dash and doesn't occupy the factory cigarette lighter.Great price - Great Product - Lack of proper Labeling"
1,l didn't listen.....,"The other reviewers warn us, and they are all right! Perry is in fine voice, as always, but the manufacturer, OLDIES, and BMG, display their total disregard for quality reproduction here once again. Tracks 18-23 particularly have the worst background hiss of ANY cd l've ever purchased. Perry would rightly be banging on the lid of his coffin if he knew what was going on here. l've emailed OLDIES that l expect a refund( it's no one at Amazon's fault, through whom l purchased it ) , or at least a decent explanation, yet l'm not holding my breath. We'd be all better off if the one doing the remastering at OLDIES would hold there's, and the sooner the better!"
2,still dont have it,"Hello, I purchased this item around Dec 16th but I have still not received it. If you are the supplier if you can please help me out that would be great. My email is dalzell.david@gmail.com"
2,Disappointed,I purchased this from Amazon 2 years ago. Within 10 months one of the little wheels fell off. We tried to glue it back and it promptly fell off again. I'm looking for another brand to try.
4,Jasmine ES33C,"This is an extremely nice guitar for the money. I purchased it for a guitar that could travel without worrying about being out a ton if it got damaged. I was surprised to get an acoustic I pick up first just to sit and play (and I have other acoustics that cost more).The good:1. Pleasant sounding, almost sparkly clean sound a little strong on the high side but not thin or shrill.2. Nice neck, very comfortable electric guitar like neck.3. Decent electronics. (Although my light will not stay on for some reason).4. Spruce top that matches pretty well.The bad:1. It will probably need some setup work. Mine buzzed around the 7th fret and the action was not right.($60 fixed what was wrong for me)2. A little sloppy on the assembly as mine had glue on the sides of the neck where the fret board was put on.3. On mine the stain for the fret board came off on my fingers; which was annoying.Overall a good playing, nice sounding guitar"
2,Twins charm sterling silver,"The gold plated and silver Twin charms arrived and I was very dissapointed, they both feel very flimsy and not very solid. Compared to a 25 Pandora or Troll bead, there is a big difference in the quality of the items. I was shocked to find that the writing saying Twins isn't legible to the point where it is almost microscopic. This kind of defeats the point of this item, as that was my reason for purchasing it."
5,A perfect recording!,"First let tell you that I am a 35 year old male. I have very eclectic musical tastes. 1200 CD collection and growing all the time. My favorite band of all time is hands down Jethro Tull and I'm a Parrothead (a Jimmy Buffett fan for those of ya that don't know). Switchblade Symphony's Bread and Jam for Frances is a perfect album. Every track is spot on the money. I am more impressed with this album than most albums that are released today. Every single track is an absolute gem. Very moody, well written and well produced. I have purchased Switchblade Symphony's other works and this is by far their best effort in my opinion. The other recordings are good but Bread and Jam for Frances is top of the heap! This is a listen to all the way through album at it's best. ""Your dreams are filled with blood and gore. Now they're right outside your door. They're gonna get you!"""
1,A change of course for Switchblade Symphony,"Switchblade Symphony's sophmore effort represents a change of sound from their first album. Much of the ""big"" feel of ""Serpentine Gallery"" is missing here. The vocals continue to excel, but the songs aren't as interesting or as good as the prior album. Track 7, ""Harpsichord"" is the closest the band comes to their earlier effort. Hard to say if this is all due to a slight change in the band line-up, or if it represents a fundamental shift in their sound."
4,"Yes, beads are irresistible","I must agree with Linda -- beads are definitely irresistible. And, like potato chips, you can't have just one. Unlike most bead books, this one does not start with tools needed or techniques. Linda starts with the elements of design, important to all art. You need to know about line, shape, texture, color, and creating a focal point before learning how to make a piece of art. Linda does not neglect techniques, leading you through wire work, bead stringing, beading on a ground, woven beadwork, and the use of polymer clay. To inspire, she includes a 12-page gallery and designer notes. What makes this book a handy reference is the appendix which includes bead sizes, standard jewelry lengths, findings, gemstones, birthstones, design charts, and a metric conversion chart. So helpful!"
2,The Irrestible Bead,"...Unfortunately, it really didn't live up to my expectations. I was looking for something that would cover all of the basics, i.e knots etc. But after reading through, I realized that the author takes allot for granted. I would certainly not recommend this to anyone looking for something to start with."
3,More dark tales from The Dark Continent,"Karl Maier's ""This House Has Fallen"" paints a crisp portrait of Africa's most populous nation. His spare prose sharpens the colors in Nigeria's past, present and ominous future. Readers see at once the mix of potential and desperation that roil the region's politics and stir so much uncertainty outside the Third World.Trouble is, the same has been said in hundreds of books and magazine articles about South Africa, Rwanda, the fledgling Congo and at least a dozen other countries south of the Sahara -- each one a slow-burning fuse attached to continental calamity. You're left wondering if Maier's crying for help, crying wolf or simply crying in the wilderness. Unfortunately, only the equally slow burn of time will tell. ""House"" awaits its destiny."
2,Where's the spanking??,"Out of 65 pages, maybe 17 have spanking illustrations. Great art, but title of book is a MAJOR misrepresentation, more erotic."
1,Wrong description; arrived broken,"First of all, unlike the description, this item IS glazed on the inside. Second, it wouldn't have mattered anyway, because it was shipped with no padding on top OR bottom, and so not surprisingly, it arrived with a crack through the lid and a part about the size of a dime completely chipped off. I know you want it, I know it's cheap, but DON'T BUY THIS. Trust me."
1,"Cheap, not worth it","It is cheap, very very cheap, and made poorly. The elastic stretches after a few uses so it will not be same tightness as the first few wears. While I love cheap clothes to try and recreate looks, or experiment with ideas, I strongly suggest that you do not waste your money on this product"
3,Decent but not necessarily impressive,"It was a decent story and plot. However, I felt the story was too long and could have been condensed. I often found myself skimming through chapters. If you like a romance with not much depth, this is a great book. If not, it's a decent read, especially at the beach."
5,Worth every penny.,"Wonderful to see old the old Musicals at home, whenever I want. They have a lot of extra info. about them also, which is so interesting. I great buy and a great price."
5,Real Account,I feel that this book was well written and gave a good look into the life a combat medic in the field. SSG (DS) Lonsdale relays real life stories that illustrate the good and bad of being downrange. It is a great read for the military enthusiast and future Combat Medic.
5,overall good,"took pretty long to ship the order but overall pretty good deal, used book in decent condition, shipping was pretty fast, would recommend"
3,10 Days To Multiplication Mastery,This looks like a great book. I can not find where to order the wrap-ups which seem to be an important first step. Can you help?
5,Cute and educational.,"A little above a toilet training kid's head, but perfect for your guest bathroom which is where I keep mine. It's funny to hear people laughing in your guest bathroom."
4,We all need to take our poop a little less seriously...,Good book. Now we need the versions on political poop and marital poop. How about poop for dummies? Good work.Check out Dropping Almonds by Bach Anon for poop on corporate America.
2,CHEAPENED BURT'S BEES,"Someone has cheapened Burt's Bee's Beeswax and Banana hand creme, I remember I got this stuff and it used to be like thick wax and put a great coating on the hands or whatever part of the body, but now it's just crap. Like colored waseline."
4,Zoom DSL 5615 Modem ...,"This a great DSL modem, but be careful during installation. Just either install the ISP DSL software, if available, or use the Zoom installation software and you'll be online immediately. Warning: Don't install both programs, like I did at first. Installing both programs on my computer confused my wireless Netgear router when I tried to install it. It wouldn't detect the settings properly. I had to uninstall the Zoom software from my computer and reset the Zoom DSL modem and Netgear router back to factory settings. Once I did that, I plugged in the modem and connected it back to the router and the router installed correctly. Since then, the Zoom modem has been working fine with no problems and I highly recommend it."
4,Good for the 'practitioner',Very good book for the practitioner. Written in a very readable (classic) style; doesn't attempt to overwhelm the reader with exotic theory. I recommend it for people who don't have a strong background in statistics and/or probability.
1,Time After Time,"An interesting attempt at looking at how a modern woman may (or may NOT) adjust to being thrown back in time 100 years. The main character spends a great deal of time railing against the concept of time travel and saying it isn't possible. A majority of the book is spent with the main character coming to ""acceptance"" of the situation and building relationships with other women in the time.The actual romance is a secondary and minor plot. The male lead is not the focus of the character development and seems pretty flat. If you are looking for a story with a woman having trouble accepting her situation, this book is for you. If you're looking for a in-depth romance, this book misses the mark."
3,Not happy,Quick shipping but I ordered a new book and got a used book. Asked for my money back and was told that it would cost me $20. Wouldn't recommend!
5,Excellent Book,"Very helpful book, I was able to get rid of my boxy looking table layed out website and replace it with a fresh looking website in css within one day I never though learning could be so easy thank you!!"
2,Slightly disappointed,"The book is good and has some new material, but much of it is the same as another of her books. I was disappointed that she did not at least take the time to alter some of here material. It was almost as if she had just taken the pages directly from HTML 4 for the world wide web."
5,Another great book by Ms Castro,Great extra book for the CIS or programming student. Gives good basic information on working with code that goes beyond just the drag and drop type of web content production software available to most people today. Ms. Castro's books always come in handy and at a bargain price.
3,Good and Bad,"Prior to reading this book I knew HTML and a little CSS, but nothing about XHTML. This book did a good job covering HTML and XHTML. I learned a couple of things I did not know about HTML and I now feel I know just as much XHTML as HTML. I feel this book falls short when it comes to CSS. I did not gain any knowledge at all about CSS. The book covers internal CSS and does not cover external CSS. The examples on the books web page must be downloaded one at a time, no group download. If you are looking to learn HTML and/or XHTML this is a good book, but if you want to learn CSS I suggest a different book - ""CSS The Missing Manual"" by David Sawyer McFarland."
4,a good complement,"This book functions as a concise teaching reference book. I found this text to be an excellent complement, filling in the details and practical knowledge needed to create working web pages. I started with the Head First HTML book:Head First HTML with CSS & XHTML, then read this book to get tips on how to implement pages in the ""real world."" Castro makes no bones about pointing out the elements that are ""deprecated"" (going to be phased out someday), but still commonly used.The book uses a vertical split page format, one side presenting a concept, with the other showing examples of how the markup actually outputs in the browser. Castro also gives references to many other authors, both on the web and in print. Very few errors in the book. Helpful tables for HTML elements and CSS in the back. I felt the level to be just right for the beginner (which I am-- no real programming experience)."
2,Messed up,"I really liked the first 3 Information Society CDs. I was looking forward to getting this one. The music is definitely gothic in nature. If you are into self mutilation, you will probably like this CD. If you are into railing against God or authority, you will like this CD. If you are into doing heavy drugs, you will like this CD. One wonders what kind of drugs Kurt was on when he wrote this thing. One thing I can say in defense of this CD is that SOME of Kurt's musical talent comes through in spite of his descent into a personal hell (track 1 is actually good ... until he starts singing). I just hope he comes out of this dark phase in his life.The data CD which comes with it does provide insight into InSoc's history ... but does not explain how he arrived at his current state."
2,A bad joke...,"In all honesty, before Info Society...or shall I say, Kurt Harland, released this album, I was a big-time Info Society fan. Now, I'm not, any longer. The lyrics on this album are very depressing, melodramatic, negative and indicative of a loss of confidence and happiness. The music is very unintellectually organized, discordant, and depressing. Notwithstanding, I'm not a stickler for gothic, dark type of music, I'm not a hater of it, either. But THIS album, -while having SOME talented and cool elements, musical-wise in CERTAIN parts of songs, is just a joke. It was a total waste of money. It was obviously produced/invented by a spiritually-marred frame of mind. The only way I can see one enjoying this album, or finding it pleasing or gratifiying in any way is if he/she is marred him/herself and used to depressing, dark music and lyrics."
1,A big disappointment,"Unfortunately, I found this a very poor rehash which lost most of the essential flavour of the original story. Too bad."
3,Just alright,I love Sci-Fi...but this is just stupid. I will probably not purchase any more tv sci-fi if they will all be like this.
1,Just too stupid to watch,I like good sci-fi - but the plot is inane and the acting is lame. I couldn't watch it to the end - unusual for me.
2,Could be better.,"I used it for a number of years.I didn't like the rotating brush and replaced it with the Sonic Complete brush. Luckily it has the same footprint and charges on this base. So, no need to keep 2 bases.The water container grows black mold in the small holes on the bottom and there is no way to clean it well.The water pressure is weak even on the highest setting 5.Recently the hose of the irrigation system broke near the handle. The plastic became old and brittle. They should have used the material like in IV tubes. The next waterpik will be from other company."
3,oral b porfessional care 8900,"overall we are happy with this toothbrush. The waterpic isnt very strong, but seems to do the job. When this needs replacement in the future I will probably go back to and Oral B tooth brush and a separate waterpic."
4,Oral B ProfessionalCare 8900 DLX OxyJet Oral Care Center,This is my second Braun-Oral B oral care product. The first lasted 15 years. I expect this one to last as long. It makes dental care almost fun!Check it out.J Karr
5,Clean and Shine Your Teeth,I highly recommend this toothbrush to anyone who still has teeth and wants to keep them. It does an excellent job and even reminds you to go to the next part of your mouth. The big plus in this model is the water-pik attachment. To truly clean your teeth you must spray them with water at the right speed. This model does an excellent job. It gets in all those nooks and crannies and has two speeds to choose from.
2,WEAK,"Only useful for real temporary applications. Don't expect it to hold for long though, and in some cases, won't even begin to adhere to certain surfaces.. not even on itself."
4,"Great tape, expensive way to get it","This is great name brand Duck Tape, but this is not the cheapest way to get it. You will save a lot at your local Wal-Mart."
2,Disappointing,"I'm a dedicated Peter Gabriel fan, and a huge fan of classical music of most stripes. This album was a disappointment as much of the music is not particularly well suited for such orchestration. A driving rhythm section is clearly needed for many of his songs as we remember them and I'm not sure they do very well re-imagined without them. I greatly respect Peter's artistry and compositions and I'm sure he wanted to do something different after so many years. However, I think if he had maintained the rhythm sections (and bass) with the orchestra, this would have been far more effective - to me."
1,No Blood; Dead in London,"What a huge let-down! This concert is unwatchable in one sitting. It's so boring I fell asleep the first three times I tried to watch it, and had to set it aside for a while. There is no energy, it's like Pete is reading a eulogy rather than singing in a concert. The female accompaniment was likewise poor. For me this was a huge waste of money, I will probably never put this disc in my player again.I'm truly amazed that some people have given this title a good review, different strokes I guess.Jay"
1,Disappointed,I received this for Christmas from my mother and it worked only once. The motor burned out and the company would not honor the warranty. Both the company and the fountain were a HUGE diappointment. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!
4,Decent debut....,"I came across Seth's second book first, Shining City, loved it, so I thought that I would give this one a try...at first I was not digging it as much as I loved Shining City, not as funny, but this is a decent story, full of detail, and just an all around great book. I feel for Frank, a comic who has been acosted to write for a television show that he just does not want to do. Still trying to keep current in the comedy sector, he decides to write for the show, and compete with Lloyd, his nemesis. After becoming entralled in a drunken fight at a bar in Tulsa, and after leaving the bar to find solace in his nearby motel room, he finds himself wrapped up in a murder, that he is sure he did not commit. Interesting....."
4,Something missing...,"The art was great.The story was well written. I had to watch it twice to really understand who was fighting who and who was on what side. It seemed like there should have been a girl in this movie somewhere. Oh well. There may have been too much blood for my taste, but if you like that sort of thing, this one is for you. With all that being said, I really enjoyed this movie."
2,4 starz for the beatz/ 0 stars for the lyrics,"Another case of a rapper from the Southwest with nothing but a good beat machine. This is gonna make some people mad, but anyone who has been a die-hard HipHop/ Rap fan for more than a minute knows this: SPM, Baby Bash, and now Lil Rob have zero lyrical ability. This CD is plagued with one-line rhymes, misdirection, and occasional confusion. Radioheads tend to love it though, so this just might suit you."
2,Love the idea... but... depth is key...,I guess I missed the need to ensure the depth of the window frame wasn't too deep. Fits perfectly around the window... but the shallow depth of this frame doesn't work for my windows. Emailed ODL... but no response yet. Hopefully there is a solution to allow me to keep the shades... But buyer be warned ensure your frame is shallow because otherwise it doesn't seem to fit even if it fits around the window frames themselves.
1,Not acceptable,"The book was cheap enough, with only the p&h to pay for. The pages of the paperback were brown, and started falling out as soon as I handled it. It actually was not what I expected it to be, so I threw it away. It doesn't matter to me."
5,Some Things You Never Forget!,"As we follow Brie on her hunt for revenge and retribution against the man that killed her mother, we are taken on a journey. The ups and downs of the hunt, the man she meets along the way and all the sordid family secrets, keep you wondering what will happen next.Great job Mr. Nelson, I can't wait for more books from you. Two Thumbs Up!Recommendation: HIGHLY RECOMMENDEDLynn Young is the Managing Editor of MWLA, A reviewer and an Editor."
3,Kind of Country ?,"I guess when I think of Phil Madeira, I think of his key prowess in the PKB days around the early 80's. This is not that kind of music. Not that it's poor quality, just not what I was expecting. In my opinion, it really leans toward a Country type sound. Not being a Country fan, it's hard for me to give a fair rating on this. I guess anyone thinking of buying it needs to be aware, at least to some extent, of more or less what it's like."
4,Great TV - HDMI Useless,"Have had 61"" Samsung for 3 months. Picture is great but cannot use some of the features, such as the 6 different screen options due to cable box limitations. Also, connected HDMI port to new Samsung DVD player through a HDMI/DVI adapter cable but get no signal. Was told by Best Buy reps that HDMI will only work with another device that also has HDMI. Since both my cable box and DVD player do not have HDMI, that feature is worthless today. Also have noticed a lip sync problem with the HD TV network transmissions. Was told by salesperson that this is a network TV or cable box problem. Not too sure about that one. Anyone else with the same problem out there?"
3,SAMSUNG CUST SERVICE IS HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"IT'S a shame that the tv looks great but, when i called for tch help or service i was put on hold and disconnected 6 times in an hour and a half when i asked for a supervisor, no one was available.ther seems to be very poor customer service here for a $4000.00 purchase.LET IT BE KNOWN YOU CANNOT SWAP PICTURE IN PICTURE WHEN ONE SOURCE IS A CABLE BOX going to ""component 1"" AND you have another signal going to another spot such as ""Av1"" Disappointing!!!!!"
3,"Good, but beware","As others have said this is a good sound card. But beware that once you've installed the card, there's no going back. Installing the Audigy SE disabled my onboard sound permanently, even after physically removing the card and uninstalling its drivers. And I couldn't get the onboard sound back even after doing a System Restore in Windows XP! I was planning to go back to the onboard sound and use this card in a different computer, but once the card is installed it's a permanent commitment. Never thought I'd be legally married to a piece of computer hardware."
2,Not fully compatible with Windows Vista yet,"This sound card has a ""Works with Windows Vista"" sticker on the box, but the software that came in the box is only compatible with Windows 2000 and XP.You can get a basic Windows Vista driver (but no additional software) from Creative's web site, but that driver has known problems with crackling and studdering noises in games that use DirectX. Read the Creative support forum, and you'll find dozens of angry customers who are having the same problem.I'm sure that the card works great with Windows XP, but as a Vista user I got hosed!"
1,not supported by creative,"if you do not have a full size computer case, save your money. I purchased this card to upgrade the integrated sound card that came with my computer. unfortunately, they do not specify that this product only fits full size comuter towers.When I discovered this fact I contacted Creative Labs, the maker of the SoundBlaster Audigy SE card and was told that they no longer offer the compact bracket nessessary to make it compatable with my computer.when buying a sound card make sure it states that it has a low profile bracket or chances are it will not fit your computer case. (most desktop computers sold now are compact towers).I'm sure it would be good product, if only I was able to use it.Kudos to Amazon for their easy to use and clear return policy."
4,Does the job,"The sound card that came with my computer (now two years old) had developed a popping/crackling sound. I bought the Soundblaster Audigy SE from Amazon. It arrived within a week. Now, I'm not very experienced with computer hardware--I'd rather it left me alone, and I'd do the same, but this was very easy--just popped the side panel off the computer case--didn't even have to disconnect all the other wires from the case--just the speaker wire that came from the sound card--unscrewed the one screw holding the old sound card in place, and pulled it straight out. The new sound card went in the same way, then plugged the speaker wire back in (green to green), replaced the screw and the side panel of the computer case, plugged the power cord back in, and booted the computer up. Inserted the CD that came with the sound card--it installed the driver (along with some other sound software)--took about 20 minutes total. No more Snap/Crackle/Pop!"
3,Not so great clip,I bought this product because I needed somethng to hold my iPod while I was working out and running. It comes with an arm band which secures nicely but is a little awkward for me. The clip is absolutely useless if you are trying to run because it swivels. I do like the jacket because it protects my iPod wonderfully. The downside is it is a little bulky.
4,"A few years out of date, but good","The biggest weakness is that the book doesn't contain anything about this season's incredible crop of rookies, from Jackie Stiles to Katie Smith. However, if your local paper's sports section is as lousy at WNBA coverage as mine is, the book contains a treasure of pictures and words about some of the solidest basketball players in the world."
5,Perfect Gift,"I bought this box as a gift for my daughter who is expecting my first grandchild. We loved them so much, I got on-line to purchase other books by Karen Katz."
3,Nice books but flaps are weak,"The books were very sweet, colorful, cute and really does teach body parts. However, unlike other lift-the-flap books the flaps are glued on and not cutouts of the page like other books. My daughter is 15 months and immediately ripped several flaps off just lifting them up too roughly. I tried to glue them back but she just ripped them off again. This book is made for babies/toddlers but doesn't withstand their normal activity."
5,Holds Interest Over Time,"My granddaughter, now 20 months, still loves these books. First we ""read"" the Mommy book, then the other two. These are the first thing she goes for when she comes and have held her interest longer than any other toy but her ""baby"".The illustrations are colorful, cross cultural lines, and are very engaging. In ""Where is Baby's Mommy"" the illustrations build on all the things baby finds on his search for mommy, making for great repetitive learning.The books are durable and lightweight, though hard for little hands to get out of the box. That's why there are ""Amma""s."
2,The musics not far off perfect it's just too short,"I liked the music on this record as the music from the film is very pituresque it just seemed that it perhaps went to try and get too close to the prospect of been sranded on this desrted island like when theres the section with the waves on this disc you just wish it would shut up really and get back to the music, theres nothing wrong with waves just cut it down a little. They could really do with making the music longer on these discs taken from films as this genre of music in general is long and this is a good reflection on a long record but it's cut short, why?. Another thing is that if you want to buy the music from the castaway film alone you cant do that as you get back to the future and everything in this, this record just seemed to condescend and was a real let down"
2,Not too impressed,"I was disappointed in this video. The actual video was boring to watch and a bit simple! ALso, the first 30 minutes are a step-by-step and then you get to the actual ""workout."" This is a problem because you only need to see the intro once and so when you want to repeat the workout you have to be careful that you do not rewind too far. Too much work-not a great tape."
2,"Don't bother, you can find better yoga videos.","I recently bought a number of yoga videos. This is the one I found to be the least useful.I found the verbal descriptions of the postures to be inadequate and the camera work to be substandard. Nor did I care for the flow of the 30 minute class.The videos produced by Living Arts/Yoga Journal are much better in my opinion.As an aside, the book ""Yoga for Beginners"" by Mark Ansari and Liz Lark is absolutely first rate!"
2,Gross,Tasted like grass. Not for me but if you can look past the taste then it has great ingredients. They were kind enouh to accept a return too.
1,Green Sludge,"This is the most disgusting meal replacement I have ever tried. It is a real test of character to hack this stuff down! Even in relatively small amounts, it will turn the mixture an intense green and give it a hideous plant matter taste. My only hope not to have completely wasted my money is to mix it in minuscule portions with another product that has a taste strong enough to overpower it. I bought it based on very positive reviews, but now you have been warned that not everyone has the same opinion about this stuff."
4,Ms. John Soda - Notes And The Like,"I think you could be forgiven if you mistake Ms. John Soda for Lali Puna; after all, they share the same label (the consistently good Morr Music) and the same philosophy of futuristic electronic pop. But on _Notes and the Like_, Ms. John Soda carves out its own identity, with the smooth classicalism on ""A Nod on Hold"" and ""A Million Times."" But they specialize in pure pop fun, such as the peppy ""Hands"" or the bouncy ""Outlined View."" If you can't live without guitars, then ""Scan the Ways"" will make your day. Stephanie Bohm alternates between spoken word (oftentimes processed) and singing, but her vocals match the proceedings well, especially the tinge of sadness on ""Plenty Of."" All pop should be this good."
1,Accurate but technical,"This book is constructed in a way that is very similar to IRS and tax law documents. It does contain accurate and specific information about IRAs, but is not user-friendly. It is difficult to understand (not written for a lay-person) and constructed in an outline type format that is difficult to manuever. If you are looking for a book to help you with IRA withdrawal information, this one is not it."
4,Dyna Disc Balance Cushion,Yes i like this cushion very much. It does what i wanted it to do. The saleperson was very nice.
5,To buy more books from this series,This is a great series- adventure with God included.my boys love for their daddy to read a chapter every night:-)There is a website that sells all the books from this series.[....]I bought mine from there. Enjoy!
4,Seems designed specifically for jogging,"This case is made of nice material. Unfortunately the Ipod fits rather loosely in the case. Also, one of the Velcro flaps on the top of the case covers the hold button on the Ipod. The case takes away from the Ipod's good looks and slightly hinders usage of the buttons. It doesn't do what I wanted it to do - stay out of the way and simply protect the MP3 player. However, the case would be great to use just for jogging as it comes with a belt and clip that hold the Ipod firmly."
1,Awful production,"So glad somebody mentioned the sound quality (or lack thereof) among all the rave reviews. The album was mastered by Doug Sax, one of the best in the business....what went wrong? To me, it sounds like they didn't care and just banged it out and mixed it quickly. Now this method worked great on Hiatt's 'Bring the family', one of my all-time faves. There's no doubt that Hiatt still is a decent (although predictable) songwriter and singer and his band is surely first rate. The sound and production on this one is so bad that I'm sending it back, really...the mix is off, it's way overcompressed and extremely small sounding......"
2,Shades of Billy Joe Shaver,This album reminds me of Billy Joe Shaver's last two albums with Eddy Shaver on lead guitar. Too much noise and growling. Some pretty fair lyrics that may be covered by others with a more sensitive delivery.
3,Not exactly top-of-the-line as far as slang instruction goes,"Well, anyone can tell when reading this little book that it is meant to be a humorous guide and not intended for actual practice. I found some of the sayings entertaining but not really practical even for friends to say amongst themselves jokingly. As a polyglot and a student, I have found numerous other series of language books that do a much better job of addressing idioms, colloquialisms, and slang for those truly interested in acquiring a working knowledge of a certain language. As far as a good set of books to check out for French slang, I highly recommend the ""Street French"" series and in particular, the third book, ""The Best of Naughty French."""
4,Hilarious novelty -- and novelty only,"This book is hilarious to read when you're fed up with French class or those audio language courses that have been torturing you. Perhaps a gift for the disaffected student (not for the average under age crowd, however!)Worth it alone for the phrase ""The (such and such wine) is forever a sublime ferret in my underpants.""Really, I'm tempted to give it 5 stars just for that phrase.But, as others have said, this book is useful only for its hilarity -- it is not a practical phrase book!"
4,My 4 year old loved this book!,"My 4 year old daughter picked out this book on her own at thelibrary and ever since we have been fans of Denys Cazet! As a parent,I love the way the illustrations show what is going on ""behind the scenes"" of the story told by first-grader Arnie of his first field trip to the aquarium. My daughter especially enjoyed the character who spoke in Spanish throughout the book. Even now, months after we last read it, just mentioning some of her favorite lines (such as ""squeeze a whale juiceless"") can send her into gales of laughter. This is definitely one we plan to purchase for our home library. END"
3,Nice photos,These are enjoyable is you like viewing many different lighthouse. Would have been nicer is there was audio or more explanation of photos.
5,Practical toy for five+ year old Children,Grandchildren love to play tic tac toe..This is a great quality set which should last for many years. I am very pleased with it.
1,not so great nike watch,This nike watch stops working every day. The screen disappears and no numbers are left. It is not worth your time or money.
5,WOW Three times the action!!!!!!!,"I paid all of 9 dollars for this 3 movie set.Man it was worth every penny and alot more! All 3 were very cool Karate flicks from the 70's era.Great picture and sound,nice simple package! A must have for Chiba fans! I think Adness is great!"
4,Good photos!,"I liked the photos, some of the murder sites no longer exist today, so it was neat to see the sites of the murders. The text was interesting, but the high point of this book for me was the photographs."
3,Dissapointing,"After Ego-Trip I was expecting so much more. It's the combination of Dave Aude's poor production and Keoki's bad lyrics that really bring this one down. So I guess that means everything. There is some really good tracks on here. Pass It On, Jealousy, and Kiss Kiss Bang Bang (even though it has bad lyrics also) but also some really terrible ones Smile and This Ain't No Disco are cheesy and to be avoided. Maybe next time Keoki."
3,Pass it on......to a friend.,"I popped in this cd and began to jam. The stereo level was at 29. It's Aiwa if that means anything to anyone. Keoki's vocals made me chuckle while i bounced up and down to the beats. A smile is like.......I really dug this cd...but it sort of lost me towards the end. It seemed there were too many vocals on the album. I would be really catchin a beat, then I'd hear a voice. Sometimes that is cool, but not always.If you love Keoki, you'll love this cd. I was not really a fan to begin with, and the cd didnt grip me and make me listen to it more than 3 times."
3,"Pretty, but not functional","These are exactly what I wanted. Unfortunately, they are poorly made and the tops of the bottles are irregular, meaning salt and pepper leak over the top and into the threads of the lids. So as much comes out of the threads as comes out of the holes in the lids."
2,Bad shipping package,Unfortunilty i havent learned about reading the details about actual size i expected a bigger product but saddley my fault. But the shipping was another issue. If you order this you should contact the company and ask for better stronger packaging. Mine came bent with creases in it. Good thing i was innovative in repair
3,Frustrating but interesting; author ill-served by publisher,"This is a detailed and in many ways good grammar of a language not well provided with accessible grammatical material.It is frustratingly badly proof-read and could have done with some vigorous editing. Virtually every page is disfigured by spelling errors; Gorelova's English is erratic and it seems astonishing in a work produced for an academic readership, physically well made, and expensive, so little trouble seems to have been taken to get this right. Don't Brill have English-speaking proofreaders?There are numerous slips of fact wherever I'm in a position to check. I can't (for example) believe that G. meant to say (p49) that Syriac is read from left to right. This isn't an untypical example unfortunately [incidentally, Syriac was actually _written_ vertically, which might have a bearing on her discussion at that point]"
5,just buy this already,"small brown bike is one of the few really truly emotional punk bands left out there. they love what they are doing, the tour constantly, they rock so damn hard words cant explain. Live show rules. and so does this cd. its great from start to finsih. its refreshing to get a good punk cd these days. and this is one of the greatests i own. if you missed them on the hot water tour...then you missed out on a great show."
3,Ok for a while,"I had this machine for 2 years. It worked fine, ink cartridges went quickly though. It's on it's 2 year anniversary and the head is broken. It costs $300 to replace. Out with this and in with a new one. I will buy extra warranty on my next one."
1,Don't waste your money,I bought this machine over a year ago and I have finally had it. Every time I want to use it I have to clean it. Sometimes I have to clean it multiple times and I'm still not satisfied with the print quality. Its a huge waste of time and money. The replacement cartridges are not cheap. I don't print a huge volume but I'm constantly having to replace since all the ink is used up on the print quality check sheet. I've printed out enough of those print check sheet to wallpaper a room. I never had this problem with my HP and the ink seemed to last more than twice as long.I saw this problem in the reviews before I bought but was swayed by the number of good reviews. I haven't had any problems with jams or using it with XP though. Scanner and fax are both easy to use. Just wish I could get a decent print quality out of it.
2,"Another ""error 41"" victim","We had a 5100C for approximately 2 1/2 years when it started giving the infamous Error 41 message described by others below. Apparently it is related to either a fatal print head problem or one of the motors burning out. We did like the price at the time and all the functions that came with the machine, but the slightly over two year product lifetime seems a very short time for how relatively infrequently we used it (it was our backup printer, mainly getting use as a fax, scanner, and copier).It is extremely disappointing that the 41 problem is so well known and Brother refuses to correct it once the product is out of warranty, which is right around the time 41 starts to happen to most owners. We replaced our 5100C with a Canon PIXMA 780, and will never buy another Brother product again."
1,"Loud, jams and ERROR 41 problems.",I bought this printer in 8/03 because I liked the flatbed/feed feature and the separate ink cartridges. The salesperson warned me that Brother machines were known to have frequent paper feed problems. I crossed my fingers and flashed the plastic. The scanner works great and the print quality is okay. The machine is quite noisy printing. Turned out that all the ink cartridges tended to run out about the same time -- so much for convenience. Paper jams became more of a problem the longer I owned the unit. Recently one color no longer would print regardless of how many times I cleaned the head. Now I have an ERROR 41 message requiring me to bring the unit in for repair. Brother C/S was very nice (after a 15 min. wait to talk to a rep) and immediately offered to have the unit repaired gratis. I'm shopping for a new printer.
2,the big honey hunt,"the book was in much poorer condition than indicated in the ad.the cover was yellowed, worn and shabby. all the pages were intact.very disappointed."
4,Brief History Tradition of Rabbinic Judaism - Not Kabbalah,"Despite the title of this book, the book is NOT a discussion of esoteric Kabbalah, and NOT written Abraham ben David of Posquieres. Instead, this is a scholarly book that examines only the first part of a twelfth century Hebrew text by Abraham ben David of Toledo, which is a brief history summary of the tradition of rabbinic Judaism, that is to say a brief review of the process of transmission of Talmudic doctrines in history by a chain of Talmudic scholars, listed by their names and dates. The original Hebrew text and English translation is relatively minor in historical significance, due to its brief nature, but the scholarly review and analysis about the original author and his viewpoint and purpose, as described by the modern day scholar Cohen is worthwhile for readers and scholars interested in medieval ages Jewish history."
2,misleading claims,"This product claims to be ""crafted with the care and attention of a cherished heirloom"", with game pieces ""of the highest quality"", that store in ""a wooden box"" and ""a top grain suede pouch"". While the game functions and is a lot of fun, the claims about its construction are a load of bull. The box is framed in slats of pine, about what you'd expect an orange crate to be made of. The frame is rough and ours had jagged gobs of glue in the inside corners. The playing base is medium density fiberboard with wood veneer - not solid wood. The pouch is made of microfiber fabric, sort of a faux suede. How this company gets away with such outright lies about the product's construction, which it clearly prides itself on, is beyond me. What's more amazing is that people who bought the game actually seem to believe the claims!"
4,spacey,"Don't buy this one if you liked the song ""Shockneck"" from the Industrial Revolution compilation (2nd edition) because the other songs are completely different. However, they do have a unique, almost trance-like style that is very cool. Nice rhythms (i can't spell) and nice tripped out effects, but some of the songs sound like they were recorded in a very long metal room. But if you can tolerate this, you just might like it."
3,Solid 3 stars,"It's a pretty good value for $30 bucks.The first thing I did was to remove the dual spout.It was on tight and took a few minutes to get it off.I pre-heated the mug before starting it and the coffee was drinkable right after it was finished. I used Starbucks Mild coffee - two level tablespoons and that is pretty much to my taste.I made one cup using the supplied travel mug and filled the water to the one cup line. If you go beyond the one cup line for one cup, the coffee will spill over.The coffee was kept warm enough for more than 45 minutes as I sipped it and answered emails."
3,Whatever,"Like the title said, for the price and the design of this product, it is just whatevers. If you are thinking about it, google imagine it and see if the design really makes much sense."
3,What?,"It was pretty, but it was much smaller than I thought it would be and it cost me more than it should have for the size."
5,True Hip Hop!!!,"This documentary is a look into an extraordinary group who really made their mark in this thing we call Hip Hop...not rap. Like many great groups before them the years together on the road took its toll and being human beings emotions ran high, but he music is above reproach and their legacy is cemented. if like A Tribe Called Quest this is a MUST SEE!!!"
4,Hinckley Review,"This is an excellent book describing some of the ancestors of the Hinckley family and a great number of descendents including the lineage of females' families throughout the Maine area. This book is well indexed, and is easy to navigate. Includes wills of some early ancestors."
1,"Maybe a passing grade for effort, but surely no success","This galling film-maker takes time (before the opening credits even begin) to plaster his film-festival awards and accolades before your eyes. I guess the implication is that, if you don't like this film, then you must be wrong.Well, then I must be wrong, because this poorly-paced, spottily-acted, amature film is remarkably unaffecting and pretty much pointless, unless you enjoy watching rival gang violence and lots of banal dialog. Then there is the horrendous ending. The comparisons to Romeo and Juliet are really unflattering to Romeo and Juliet. This is not Shakespeare, and isn't even mediocre.I'd skip this one and try something else. Most gay movies, even cheapie indies, are far better than this."
4,The Idaho Cowboy: A Photographic Portrayal,"David Stocklein's, The Idaho Cowboy, was a picture book of sights, smells, seasons, and images of the true Idaho Cowboy. Short essays on the seasons took up a couple pages between photo displays, which added tremendously, if you are not someone familiar with this lifestyle. You will find yourself looking at these photos over and over, each time finding something interesting, that you may have missed. Whether you are a cowboy with vast knowledge and experience or a person who dreams of places faraway, where legends still trend the earth, you will love this photographic portrayal of the Idaho Cowboy."
2,vertical motion is not smooth,"Just purchased this model and while the panning motion is nice and smooth the vertical motion is not. I use it with a five lb. spotting scope and often lose moving objects due to it's excessively jerky vertical motion. I called the manufacturer and they openly admitted that it's just not that smooth. Look elsewhere if you want a tripod that has a smooth motion. Other than that it's a well made sturdy tripod, however for over $100 I cannot recommend it."
5,Tippmann 98 custom upgrade,Great addition to my tippmann 98 custom Platinum Series.VERY easy to install. took me no more than 5 minutes to install it. Love the look and keeps me from wasting air and it is cheap for an auto feeder. AWSOME PRODUCT.
4,"Cyclone, reliable but air hogger","Worked mostly flawlessly thru several game, only drawback was its an air hog."
3,Some chapters are very good,"Fairly basic text but good chapters on abberration, SAEKG and a few others."
2,Nice while they work !,Have had these a year and just put my factory fender lights back on my truck due to these not working anymore. The first red one went out 7 or 8 months after I installed them followed by the amber ones within a few months !
4,Great for aspiring drummers.,"I am not a musician, but I find Neal inspirational in the dedication he commits to his art. This DVD is esoteric to the drumming community, but also a fascinating view for others too."
3,DVD has tech problems,It is a rather long viewing but It is done well but.....Neil Talks too much and Im a big fan.Am I the only one that had sound and video problems with disc 2 AND 3. hAVE TO NOW SWAP IT OUT FOR ANOTHER.NOT HAPPY
3,Neil Peart,Very good video. However it is very long (3 DVDs) and Neil is long winded. I got bored with some of the interviews. This could have been cut down into one DVD in my opinion.
5,Madre Mia...,"There is something about Spanish's Passion & Love power that is captivating for the soul. And Chambao is an expert in mixing traditional Flamenco with an incredibly Modern chilled Jazzy tunes. They connect Past to the Future so effortlessly... As a result, you might just find yourself in this very moment (Present) where things start to make better sense & hopefully a smile will be drawn across your face... I must say this album had a profound impression on me. (especially tracks: Pokito a Poko,camino interior,como lo siento, & sueno Y muero). If you are not prjeduce against Art, This Album might satisfy your soul beyond belief. Also, recommend Flamenco Lounge & chill 2 (VA)! Hope you enjoy..."
1,natural cures,I purchased this book when it first came out. After recieving this book I wasnt that impressed with it because the author says by law we cant give out cure information. I was very unhappy. This is a rip off Please DONT buy it!!
1,meh,This dvd was dissappointing.. there is only 1 comedian who is actually somewhat funny.. thought the models would make up for it but there are really poor camera shots aswell.. so :(
5,The adventure continues...,"The Drew children join forces with Will Stanton in a return to the Cornish seaside village that was the setting of the first book. The grail the Drews discovered in the first book has been stolen from the British Museum, and the forces of the Dark are responsible. Arriving just in time for the Greenwitch ceremony, Jane is invited to participate in the manufacture and sacrifice of the Greenwitch and to make a wish. She makes a surprising one that has significant consequences.Merriman is back, and the owner of The Grey House, as well as assorted other characters both good and not. There are some marvellous scenes in this book--notably when Merriman and Will plead their case to the sea. The Greenwitch herself is a force to be reckoned with, and the revelations in the final chapter pave the way for the continuation of the series. I can't wait to read the next book!"
3,sticky,"Smells like Juicy-fruit gum but that smell goes away quickly after applied. The cream is sticky, though. Not sure how well I like it yet."
2,Questionable facts,"The author cites research of mine on deafness, but gets the facts about my research wrong and gets the reference citation wrong. Hopefully he does a better job with the other research he quotes."
4,How Dogs Think,"I have an 18 months old Westie, a dog known for it's independence and ""having a mind of it's own"". I am interested in understanding the thought process of my dog so as to understands her behavior.The subject of the book is very well researched and well organized and well written. I learned a great deal from it and understand my dog's behavior much better."
5,ATHF Classic,"ATHF is a classic that should be watched with your children, your children's children, and so on. These shows are entertaining."
4,No complaints,"Fast shipping and product worked perfectly. Product was not supposed to be shipped until middle of May, but arrived four days later. Thanks!"
3,not incredible...sorta ok,"I am an enormous fan of this series and having never seen thethird set I was understandably excited by the prospect of new hijinks. Well, it wasn't that bad... It seems like the writing is starting to stretch a little thin. The jokes are the same and getting flogged to death. In my opinion there are a few episodes that are toatlly unwatchable. Stupid, but not in a good way...Plus less episodes and some lame attempt at filler by including scripts and other non essentials. This is definitely a must for fans and I won't give up my copy, but it is the weak one of the three and I'm a little steamed that I payed full price for it."
5,Favorite Show,"Love this collection. I could not be happier. Being able to watch Aqua Teen whenever I feel like is an accomplishment in itself. I wish I could give it ten stars for being so hilarious. Who knew that a box of fries, and milkshake, and a ball of meat could cause so much chaos...poor Carl."

2,What do you expect for the money!,Bought this for my wife for Xmas and am returning it. She didn't like the cheap look of the keyboard stand or the bench. I'm going to build her a stand and we'll find a bench. Good for a kid's room but not an item for an adult.
3,Review for story NOT actual product,"This book is D-R-Y! It does have good parts that keep you reading, BUT it never actually picks up to the point of page turner...if you've got a weekend to kill and absolutely no spell binding reads on your list, pick it up. It's not awful, but leaves alot to be desired. You will LOVE this book IF you are into the 19th century Country Houses of England."
5,EVEN BETTER THAN EXPECTED,"JUST BEAUTIFUL, VERY COMFORTABLE, I DECIDED TO PAY THE PRICE IN HOPES THAT THIS ANKLE BRACELET WILL LAST A VERY LONG TIME, BECAUSE I REALLY LIKE IT..."
1,horrible bottles,Mine did not come with a hanger for it. You can hardly see if there is any water in it due to the blue color. Water continuously leaks from it. These bottles are cheaply made and ridiculously flimsy. I do not recommend them at all!!
4,good survice,"the book came in, in a timely fashion that helped me a lot with my test. I was just glad I didn't have to pay and arm or a leg for it."
4,Amazing,This is an amazing case for protecting the very scratchable backside of the 3rd generation of ipods. The only complaint i have about this case is that it does not cover the screen (but it's still a great buy!).
5,Great eq for bass rig,Bought this EQ to use on a bass guitar setup. I considered an eq pedal. But for the same price (less on some eq pedals) I got this one that has additional input and more bands to play with. Provides the rich tone I was looking for out of my rig. Highly recomend this over ANY eq effects pedal.
3,Good price but faulty quality.,After a month of use the Left channel started failing. Will call Behringer to replace it. Hopefully the next one wont have these problems.
1,And to think this book has ties to Girl Scouts,"My children 14 y/o, 12 y/o may be exposed to people with too liberal sexual ideals, but they are NOT interested in these types of visuals. When my children turned 12, I had 'the talk' with them. They both reacted by crying. My boy asked,"" Why do we need to know this stuff if we're supposed to wait until we're married?,"" with tears in his eyes. I never saw images such as those in the book until I was out of high school, and I know perfectly well how to have babies. I choose not to indulge in the other things and would much rather those images had never entered my brain in the first place."
5,Three of Three: For Middle High Youth!,"This book came to me through the Our Whole Lives faith and sexuality curriculum. It has two partner books, for older age groups. All three are excellent, and have been ""tested"" with several friends' families.I highly recommend this book, and its ""younger siblings,"" It's So Amazing and It's Not the Stork. Check out all three, then look for a church or organization that offers Our Whole Lives!"
4,A fun little movie.,"I adore Takeshi Kaneshiro so I buy all his movies when they come out on region one. This was a fun little movie and he was actually quite adorable in in. There was one scene I played back a few times because he seemed so innocent and playful. It's a decent movie, odd casting for his mother though, but honestly if I didn't adore Takeshi (not only looks but his acting as well) I wouldn't have spent so much for the DVD. I wasn't disappointed though. It's a feel good movie with a lesson learned in the end and the cast is good."
1,Sound is kind of Garbled,"Not my favorite CD... No banter with the audience, and I thought that the sound was garbled on quite a few tracks.. I thought that it was the disc, but it does the same thing on the limited edition one that I also own... I now have it sitting in my CD case collecting dust... I own one other CD by the Monkees that was live in concert from 1967. It had the Banter with the auduence, as well as music too. Sorry Rick but you need to add some laughs or fan interaction with the music. Take a cue from the Monkees and add fun to it too... Hearing the crowds makes it more exciting.... Sorry to say that the disc is a clean miss on that point... The Garbled sounds are most noticable when he is singing on some of the songs... If I had to give it stars, I guess that one would be it..."
2,Don't buy,"These ""All About"" videos are interesting for kids, but parents will be taken aback. They are ""hosted"" by the very creepy Hard Hat Harry; a strange genie who pops up in the middle of kids playing, and takes them on adventures. I certainly don't want my kids to wander off with some weird guy who invites them to look at trains/cars/etc. Honestly, he strikes my wife and me as a potential molester. Finally, the quality of the videos is lousy: many of them look to be filmed - poorly - in the early 1980's. We are not buying any more of this series, and now have to explain to our kids about talking to strangers."
3,Good But Needs Work,"I got this guitar for my son as a Christmas present and found it has both good and bad points.The good: Looks new, came with all parts, no scratches or rust. Everything works very well on the guitar with the exceptions noted below.Excellent price for a beginner guitar.The bad: Slight fret buzz (strings sometimes hit the frets up by the neck of the guitar), so the guitar will have to be adjusted to eliminate that. In my opinion, that adjustment should have been done before reselling it;No manual of any sort included, and could not find one on the Yamaha site, so adjustment may be tricky;Lastly, I agree with one of the other reviewers that the single box packaging is not enough protection for shipping this guitar."
3,It's not bad,"After purchasing this guitar, I was warned to never buy a used guitar online, so I was pretty apprehensive in waiting for it to come. When it got here, it didn't seem that bad. I'm sorry for PH_7 who never got a cable. But mine came with a 9 foot cable, a set of allen keys and the Tremolo arm, which you screw onto the guitar. Although I was a little dissapointed in the guitar's body condition. By refurbished, I guess it means that they replaced certain parts. But my guitar had scratches on the frount, one of the pickup is rusty and the strings are a little old. But hey, it is a used guitar.All in all, I'm pretty satisfied. I think it's a good guitar for a beginner who doesn't need a $700 fender to start on."
3,Eh,It didn't work for my Jetta power steering. I thought it did at first. Hard to judge after just one use though.
1,Didn't work.,"Even though the product says ""Stops leaks"" I used it to soak the rubber bushings on my leaf springs to stop them from squeaking on my truck. The product has a video showing you to do such. It was supposed to chemicaly react with the old rubber and stop it from further breaking down, therefore no more squeeking. It may work for you, it just didn't work for me. Oh well."
3,Can't realy tell,like other reviews said it will not fix a bad seal and that is what i had. I ended up repleacing the remain seal. Still worth a shot though i'd say.
5,2nd try is the charm,i had a power steering leak...a leak bad enough to drain it dry in a few days...so i poured alittle at-205 right into the power steering and drove around for a bit..came back the next day and it was down again...so i poured more into it...and it hasnt leaked since! been a few months of strenuous driving...about 1500 miles and no problems....i still had half the bottle left too...so you dont need to use it all in 1 go
2,What this does,In a Vidio on YouTube this mech said that it if sprayed on the Rubber bushing up front it would stop all the sounds and revive the rubber i tryed it and still have all the noise as far as stopinging leaks i dont know about that i STILL have all the sounds when you drive the Truck.!
1,I cant believe I fell for this,"Ahh the old ""magic potion"" tick! I completely fell for this gimmick. I bought it hoping it would solve my gasket leak, but what a moron I was to think that something like this would work - needless to say, there is still oil all over the drive way."
4,RESULTS WILL VARY,"As stated by other reviewers, results CAN vary. I have used it in the power steering system of a 91 Sable with mixed results. Over time, the leak came back-but putting a little more treatment did slow/stop the leak. I have no problem putting more in in the future. The seals between the pump & plastic reservoir was the issue-even though it was replaced.I have also used this in an old 79 Pinto engine. The leak did slow down & I was happy with the results.Keep in mind that this product reconditions GOOD seals. If there is a nick or damage to the seal, it will not work. Also, if the shaft is grooved (seal running in groove) it will not work. Basically, if the seal is cracked, sorry...it should be replaced.People have to realize that after two applications of this product, if the leak does not improve/stop, there is damage to the seal/sealing surface. A ""fix in a bottle"" will not work. It is not a cure all.Good luck!"
2,That religious feel,"Sweet story...but only for those that believe in God or a high power. I didn't realize that was what this book was about. The tree was suposed to be the person abnd the sun was ""god"" or the higher power."
5,Even better than the first,"This cd just kicks. We liked the last from delinquent habits, but this one is just amazing. Even those who are not rap fans have had good comments while over our place. They especialy like Return of the tres, which is one of my favs too. They blend spanish and english so well that hubby and I both can understand everything.(he speaks fluent spanish and I dont speak a word) Great tunes. A must have."
5,GREAT cuticle creme,"You won't be disappointed with this product...that is, as long as you don't mind the lemon scent. I use this product every day and have been using it for many months. It moisturizes the cuticles so they aren't all white and annoying looking. This is particularly useful for people like me who don't paint fingernails. Professional manicures just never made my list of priorities. Using this product makes the nails look ""clean"" and healthy. I can't imagine being without it!"
5,Excellent,"This is really good stuff for keeping those cuticles in good shape so they do not dry out and cause problems. It has a good scent -- not all girly, so it's good for guys (like me) who wash their hands often and gals who like the lemony freshness."
1,"Simple Yes, Powerful No","Don't waste your money on these ""sensational"" ""simple"" ""powerful"" books. The information in these books can basically be found online using the keywords ""meditation techniques"". The book makes numerous authoritative claims and implies the information comes from God, but these claims appear to come more from the author's ego than God's mouth. The piece de resistance of the book is the ""powerful"" technique called ""running energy""--again, this is something easy to find online. Not only that, but the writer seems to assume all readers IQ's average 70. A complete waste of time and money.For a couple of great books about this subject, try ""Cosmic Consciousness"" by Dr. Richard M. Bucke or ""The Power of Now"" by Eckhart Tolle."
5,"Somthing a little different, and good!","This is an excellent trance CD. Probably one of the best I have heard. As you may have guessed, this CD was done in Tokyo, Japan. For whatever reason, I think the tracks sound a little Japanese, not like Pokemon, but in a good way. The CD case and attached pamphlet are absolutely superb, I probably spent 15 minuets looking at it, and then looking at it again! The picture behind the CD itself is VERY Japanese.Overall, this is a great CD. It had the total, nonstop club feeling, but with little to no background noise. The music itself is also superb.If you have read this review, you probably like trance and the whole electronic music scene; so, you should buy this, as it is a great CD. I am on the 10th plus listen and am JUST getting all the subtleties of it.GREAT CD!!! GET IT!!!"
1,Poor value for money,I bought this software hoping it would teach me german from the ground up .This just threw me right in to speaking words and phrases I found it diffcult to use and follow.I bought a book and some cassette tapes and found them to be superior for my money for a lot less dollars.I will try them AGAIN cause I cannot take it back BUYER BEWARE.
1,Too much static,"I put this monitor on my baby registry, and wish I hadn't. It was so static-y that I couldn't even hear the baby crying! I returned it and bought the fisher price 900Mhz monitor, it is so much better! Don't waste you money on this one, it stinks."
2,Lots of static,Plus we were getting feedback on the unit in the nursery. Not good when our baby naps!
1,Don't Know Anything Yet,Don't know anything about the puzzle as I sent it to my nephew in Oregon and I don't even know if he received it. Haven't heard anything.
1,Not a good book.,"I have to go through this because it is a required professional exam textbook.There are many things need to improved:1, English language please. For example page 420.2, Numbers do not match at several places. Again page 420.3, Redendent logics, for example formula 9.2.4, And why a bad example always a ""he"" and good example always ""she""??? Sexual discrimination???I expect 4th edition book not this bad. Maybe it is rushed to publish. ""Price Theory"" is a good book for example if people wonder."
3,"not a novel, but a self-help book","I bought this book because I had loved Myers' previous work, ""Monster."" However, I was rather disappointed by ""Handbook for Boys""' lack of storyline. The stuff Duke talks about is all true and good, and Jimmy seems to accept and understand all of this. But almost nowhere in the book do we see Jimmy actually applying this newly acquired wisdom. And you never get to figure out how exactly Duke, Cap, and Mr. M got that smart in the first place! It would've been nice if Mr. Myers had given some background on Duke's life at least. All in all, ""Handbook for Boys"" is more of a self-help book for teens (not just boys, either), than an actual novel."
1,don't waste your time,"I beleived that I was buying a comprehensive manual. Every specification refers you to the ""manual specific to your model"".To sum this book up in one short sentence....IT SUCKS"
3,"Useful information, but lacks detailed data","I bought this because I had just purchased a Harley FLHRI Road King, and wanted to become familiar with the machine before the bike was delivered. While the book does contain a lot of useful, but very general information, it does not contain any specific detail, prefering instead to refer you to the OEM's manuals as soon as you need to get specific on any topic. While I understand that this has been done in order to encompass the huge range of machines covered by this book, had there been a little more detail, the book would have been great. The writing style is excellent, and the book is an easy and worthwhile read if you are mildly interested in Harley's Evolution series of machines, but I think that the title V-Twin Owners Bible is a bit of an overstatement, as this will not be the first book I grab if I have a technical issue with one of my Harleys - instead, that will be the OEM's publication to which this book constantly refers you."
1,PURE CONTRADICTION,"Thomas Jefferson was no Satan. But, I will implore all the fanatics and sycophants who revere him as a 'man of justice and freedom' to wake-up from their slumber. Don't let the world laugh at your ignorance!Mr Jefferson was by every means a slave-holder. Thus, this idea of linking his name to the Rights of Man is a contradiction.If Dumas Malone must continue on this track, then he should mention the names of John Adams, James Monroe, John Quincy Adams, and Abraham Lincoln, and we shall listen to him. Thomas Jefferson does not fit in this realm. He doesn't belong here! But, I am not really surprised. This book was published in 1951: at the peak of Color-Bar."
2,Contains nothing unique or insightful,"As others have said the book's contents are available online for free.For do do-it-yourself repairs you need to know the possible causes of the DTC Codes. Obviously this data would likely be different for each vehicle model and year. For this info you must either have the factory service manual or go online and search for this info using the DTC code along with your vehicle's model and year. It is probable that others with your same vehicle model and year have experienced the very same code and they will share their insight.Sometimes the ""Service Engine"" light comes on and the corresponding DTC code indicates the problem is an ""emissions system fault"". A very common emission system code on most cars can be remedied by simply tightening the gas cap. Seriously!"
2,not as much help as I'd like,"Not an easy book to interpret your car problems with. Starting from this manual, if you're an engineer (I am) or professional mechanic you may be able to solve your vehicle problems (I did)."
4,Haynes Tech book,"Ihave not had the time yet to evaluate the content of the book, but a quick look indicates it may be of value when attempting to maintain my 2009 Prius and 2000 Silverado."
1,Save Money and Use the Internet!,"The book is good quality, easy to read, and structured well. However, I think all of the information in this book is available on the internet for free. I guess if you want to have a hard copy of this type data in your garage it is worth it."
5,Is a good resource for the code reader,This book is a good resource to have on hand when using a code reader to diagnose a check engine light warning. The book and reader will quickly allow you to find what needs to be done to replace just which part to keep your car in good running condition.The reader and book will save you the purchase price the first time you use it. As far as the technical skills to change the part all you need are simple skills like needed for fixing a car in the good old days and some basic hand tools.
3,OK,Like a lot of publications that try to cover a lot of models or options it is difficult to see the wood for the trees. This is particularly the case here where the subject is reasonably technical. I think the book needs to be model specific so people with moderate engineering knowledge can more easily follow it.
3,"""Part 1"" means it's actually 1/4 of the game",".hack is a good game, just release this is a quarter of the full game. I was happily playing along then it suddenly stops, and in order to continue you'll need to buy the next game. Then load up your old save game file and continue on in the game and story line.Now, if you can get by the fact you'll be spending over a hundred dollars to play this through it... it is a very good game. Lots of exploration ability, graphics are ok, and a very unique interface. As I said, if you can get past this being .25 of a game then it's good."
5,Great Game,"This is a great game for any person wanting to start a good RPG, it also has more than one game to finish, allowing you to carry your levels and items from game to game"
1,The same old rubbish wrapped up in a fancy garbage bag,"Of course you will say that the laws of Nature were invented by the God of the Bible, the God who said that male homosexual behaviour was ""an abomination"" -- laws of Nature supposedly invented out of nothing a mere 6,000 years ago. Then you will tell me that these laws of Nature are a penal code that can be violated, and that sodomy is just such a violation. Well, if the laws of Nature can be violated, then just how do you violate the law of Gravity? Can you choose to ignore gravity by a simple act of will-power, floating up into the sky? OF COURSE NOT! The laws of Nature cannot be violated as if they were a penal code. Everything that exists is ipso facto natural. Please don't give me the old ""carrot in the ear"" argument. This book is just more of the same paranoid stuff you get on World Net Daily, the chitchat about the Agenda."
2,"Great Songs, Great Band- Bad Recording","These are some excellent songs, however, as the outside packaging fails to infrom you, 13 of the 18 tracks are live recordings. The recordings of the live tracks are quite poor...you can barely hear most of Darby Crash's vocals. The aggression of the band comes through great, but Darby's vocals really make the Germs, and that is lacking here. I suggest you get the anthology where you get the whole thing. The Germs were definitely an excellent aggressive band."
5,hip hop fan,"If you like underground hip hop then this album is what you are looking for. Esoteric comes to the correct on his debut lp, while production is handled by the vinal reanimators and 7l. The guest list is also phat with inspectah deck, icon from jedi mind tricks, reks and apathy, and akrobat. Hands down five mic material."
3,nice but not monumental,"this one was alittle difficult to review, i mean lyrics were pretty good, but at times the delivery was off, and at other times the delivery and the flow was on point and the beat was lacking something, whther he needed to chop in another sample or let the bass kick harder, it was just kind of eh."
3,Does it really work?,"I ordered this product for my Mom who is trying to get rid of some age spots.I've never really personally used it long enough per the instructions to seeany improvements on my freckles or scars or age spots, but my grandmotheruses this product and she has flawless skin at 80+ years old. But I do wonderwhy this product has been discontinued on most websites that were selling it before.I've only managed to find this product on Amazon."
3,RAY FERRY - SHAME ON YOU,"HAVING OBTAINED FAMOUS MONSTERS IN A HOSTILE TAKEOVER AND THROUGH THE FLEECING OF THE BELOVED FORRY ACKERMAN, RAY FERRY NOW HAS DECIDED TO SHUT OUT ALL THE FANS AS WELL AND MAKE THE MAGAZINE HIS OWN PRIVATE PLACE. EVERY ISSUE THAT COMES OUT IS #1 - OVERPRICED FOR THE AVERAGE FAN, PARTICULARLY KIDS, TYHEREBY LEAVING A DIM FUTURE LEGACY FOR THIS ONCE GREAT MAGAZINE. SURE THE GLOSSY STOCK AND PRINT STANDARDS ARE SECOND TO NONE, BUT AT WHAT COST TO IT'S GROWTH. #2 - DISTRIBUTION IS NON-EXISTANT HERE IN CENTRAL JERSEY (MADE EVEN MORE SHAMEFUL CONSIDERING MR. FERRY'S ROOTS).AN INTERESTING READ THAT ONLY MADE ME VIEW FERRY AS A THIEF AND POOR OLD FORRY AS A VICTIM. MAYBE IT'S TRUE THAT FORRY MADE A LOT OF DEMANDS AND ASKED FOR A LOT BUT AFTER ALL, WHERE WOULD MR. FERRY BE TODAY IF IT WEREN'T FOR MR. ACKERMAN? PROBABLY DOING PORTRAITS AT THE LOCAL SEARS.SHAME ON YOU RAY FERRY - THE 'NEW' FAMOUS MONSTERS IS AN IMPOSTER! I'D RATHER READ 'RUE MORGUE'."
1,"Ferry, not Forry, the true phony","I, too, was sucked into Ferry's world of make believe martyrdom. Then, I wrote an article for FM 247 (How Do You Like Your Horror?) and found out about the REAL Ferry. After being promised a measly $25 for my article, which was heavily edited, I never saw a dime, even after sending several e-mails first asking for, then demanding payment. Many of my e-mails got conveniently ""lost"" and to this day, I haven't seen a cent. I guess I was luckier than poor Forry - he was bilked out of thousands, not to mention his own house and much of his priceless collection!"
1,A Petty Minded Diatribe From an Unscrupulous Opportunist,"Ray Ferry has legitimately earned himself a most dishonourable reputation from those within the Horror/Sci-Fi fan community. A California court found him liable for breach of contract, libel and trademark infringement in his dealings with Famous Monsters founder Forest J. Ackerman. This book is Ferry's revenge and also a another money making venture. He even plans to write a sequal to it. Besides the obvious money making motive, the purpose was to snipe at many individuals legitimately working hard to promote the Horror/Sci-fi genre. In the meantime Famous Monsters magazine is in jeopardy, as a US Bankruptcy Judge declared that Ferry fraudulently tranferred the magazine's assets to protect them from creditors.I urge readers not to subsidize Ferry's unethical behavior. Like the so-called ""revived"" Famous Monsters, this book is another Ferry engineered fraud perpetuated on the public."
2,Black Bean?? More like Black Olives!,"I was very dissapointed with these chips. I love Guitless Gourmet and I love black beans. However, these chips tasted like olives. GROSS!!"
2,A waste of time.,The story went downhill after the first dozen pages - and since it is a fairly long book you can imagine how awful it was by the end! The ending tries for Lovecraft and misses completely. The hero has all the charm and sophistication of a twelve year old and the other characters aren't any better. It is not worth your time.
3,Yarn type body,"The description was 100% cotton but it arrived as a yarn type body. Wooden frame is very sturdy and all hardware was included. Nice. I am going to give the yarn a fair chance but not sure if I will like it after having my cotton string one for nearly 15 years now.Update: It is not as comfortable as my last one (different company in Key West). The back remains higher up against my neck, can't stretch out my legs in a semi reclining relaxed position. The inner cap part of the metal ring inside the loop that holds it to the frame bent out after a few weeks but it is still functional and supports an adult firmly. I would not order again but it is a good value."
4,Glad I got it cheap,Hope this helps me studying need to pass this test so badly I am hoping this help with test formats
1,"Pretty to look at, painful to wear","It looks good. The sandal is very, very pretty. Shiny and blingy. I got them in gold. But the thong stem HURTS like hell. The whole triangular, embellished section is very tight. I bought these quite some time ago and just now pulled them out to see if they were as horrible as I remember. They are. So I stuck a pair of my husband's balled up socks in them under the triangle and I'm going to leave it there for a week or so to see if I can ever get any use out of them. They are so beautiful, and they weren't cheap, so that is the plan."
1,Memoirs of a Bitter Sexologist,"I don't think there's much of anything positive to say about this book except the author seems to soften a bit temporarily for chapter 14, that she's good at drawing and she's quite nice looking for her type (not that's about the book, but that explains why maybe this book was even published).Other than that, this book is a bitter rant that keeps on contradicting itself, for example, one minute partner sex isn't enjoyable to women than the next saying the opposite, saying if women act a certain way, they're 'just jealous', yet if men act the same, they're 'concerned' (and I thought feminism was supposed to try to tear down double-standards, not create more of them) and taking opinion as fact, as in using one study to 'prove' a hypothesis (not very scientific, is it?), etc. As far as any sort of slant, there are plenty of other guides that don't have any and are much better than this, like Violet Blue's guides."
4,Yum!,"There have already been two very descriptive and detailed reviews on this book, so I shall limit the length of my contribution. I tried two of the recipes this week - the chocolate filled monkey bread, and the chocolate caramel sticky buns. Both were out of this world. The recipes were fine to follow; my only gripe is the shameless product plugs she inserts into them (Ms. Brody sells a dough relaxer that is listed as a requirement of her bread recipes)."
4,Essential for Understanding Corporate Governance in the Global Economy,"Most corporate governance research has been on large mature businesses. Many have claimed, ""One size doesn't fit all.""This volume makes an important contribution to the idea that a firm's strategic dynamics and appropriate corporate governance practices are interlinked. It examines both life-cycle stages and how these are shaped by different contexts. The book is helpful in understanding transitions such as how governance changes from start-up to maturity as well as the consequences of ownership dispersion to family firms.The Life Cycle of Corporate Governance compiles some of the best empirical research to date on the subject and is essential reading for understanding the new global economy."
2,Coin world,Would love to give a review but it's been a month and I still have not received a single copy of coin world what's up with that?
1,Pitiful,"Kallas thinks ""Jesus at the outset did not see the full dimensions or dramatic extent of Satan's power... he affirms that the end of the world will arrive without his having to die."" (p. 90, 91) Jesus' sending of the 12 and the 70 was expected to be enough to topple Satan, but it didn't work. Only then did Jesus realize it would be harder than he thought! People with low views of Jesus have serious problems commentating on spiritual warfare. This book is awful.Dennis McCallum, authorSatan and His Kingdom: What the Bible Says and How It Matters to You"
3,HP iPAQ hx2495 Armor Case,"This has been a good case so far in regards to protecting the PocketPC. However, the outside does tend to scratch pretty nasty if comes in contact with say a set of keys. It would have been pretty nice if the case enclosed the storage cards and stylus as those will tend to come out and be lost if you don't notice they are loose. Overall, a good purchase."
2,I thought it was metal.,"Yes, it will hold my 5d with a big lens but it's very wobbly. Better for a point and shoot. Please make one in aluminum!"
2,"Only for true aficionados, otherwise it's a tough read","Satisfactorily written but unless you really need to know the day-to-day activities of the mafia and the FBI this will be a tough read. If you've read one chapter, you've read the entire book: bad guys sell drugs, gamble illegally, kill each other, then, when caught by the good guys, do whatever they can to cut deals to avoid jail time. Kudos for not romanticizing La Cosa Nostra, though. These people are crude, dull-witted, morally challenged, and, perhaps the worse crime of all, boring as heck."
2,Bruton Firestorm Stormproof Lighter,I'm not very impressed with this item. I've tried two different types of Butane and it still won't light everytime. I can blow the flame out with my breath. I don't have to blow very hard. I don't see how it will light anything in a wind . Very dissapointed. For the price I wouldn't reccomend it.
3,No demo disk,"I'm a mom who didn't know about the demo disk that does not come with this subscription. My son is very disappointed with this subscription through Amazon, and he ends up buying the store copy just for the demo disk."
1,Magazine Never Arrived,I placed my order on 05/01/10 it is now 08/12/10 and still no magazine. Seems like i am getting shafted like others that ordered the same time I did. This is absolutely terrible. Do not order this magazine.
4,xbox,my husband loves this magazine and you get a disk with free demos of up coming games. He loves getting it.
5,Got it for $5 for a year,"Regardless of the content, $5 for a years subscription to a prolific gaming magazine is good enough for me. Oh, and the OXM disc."
4,Don't really need the disk unless you don't have Live,"This magazine is great, very informative and easy to read. You can bet that if they give a game a good score it's a good game. On the issue of disk, you don't really need it if you have Xbox live because the disk really just contains demo's that Xbox live offers you sooner. I find myself not playing the disc because I have already downloaded the demo 3 weeks ago. They sometimes put on special items like gamer pics and free game content but if you don't have the game it isn't anything special and could be downloaded cheaper than paying for the disks."
1,Arrives with no plastic and no CD!,"I purchased this magazine for my son for Christmas. He has subscribed to this magazine before, but I chose to purchase through Amazon. It arrived in February, and every issue has not had any plastic covering it, and none have been accompanied by the regular demo CD. My thought is that it must be going through another party and having it read and taken apart, then mailed to us. I've tried to write to Amazon about this problem, but no reply. I do not recommend purchasing this magazine directly through this vendor, but directly from the publisher."
1,Did not receive product,"I have not received my subscription in the timeframe identified. I feel that I will not receive this subscription as I should have received by now. What is the process to see if this product will ship? Purchased on 5/30/10 with a 6-10 week delivery period. We are way beyond that timeframe. Help!!!!!Regards,Scott Harting"
2,"Great Magazine, but poor description","When I ordered this magazine, I didn't realize that the demo disk wasn't included. In fact, I re-read the description to make certain I hadn't missed that fact, but now realize that there wasn't mention that this subscription came without the demo disk. I've contacted the magazine directly, cancelled the order placed through Amazon, and ordered directly from X-Box Magazine in order to get the demo disk. For our family, that demo disk is a very important part of the magazine. I just wish I'd known before ordering from this site that the disk didn't come with this subscription."
4,Above Average for the genre - which is not saying much!,"A great entry into the world of interactive entertainment - and the disc makes it a no-brainer for those that own the system. It is quite obviousely geared at a more mature audience (say 18-25) then the typical kiddy mags in this genre. This genre (videogame mags) is quite weak however, with lame jokes, abusive editors and a target market often in the teens. This is above average for the genre, more intelligent, well organized, informative. However when the competition is so weak ... that's not saying much."
1,Still no magazine,"Like so many others here, I ordered my subscription on May 30th along with several of my friends. None of us have gotten are magazines from ""Future.""Talking to one of their customer services reps, they said it was suppose to arrive on August 13th but never showed. They said the same thing to one of my friends.If I don't get my first magazine my the end of the month, I'm going to dispute the charges with my credit card company."
1,does not come with disc,Saw this on an amazon discount daily special. Took forever to activate from time of purchase and when it did finally arrive it comes without the accompanying disc. Probably should have guessed that with the low price discount but it's definitely not the product I ordered.
1,Poor service,"First off, we never received the magazine until 5 months after ordered!!! We have only received one or two issues. Extremely Poor Service, and why get the magazine with out the disc??? I wanted to get my husband a present for Christmas, not expecting something so poor to be offered through Amazon!!!!Very displeased in PA!!"
2,Unimpressed,"Lame writing, everything they've said so far is predictable, and half of it sounds like it was written by the games' publishers as an ad."
4,Great entertainment,A good and very fun magazine with good detail a lot of useful information.I like the tips and the recomendation of the magazine.I just dont like the aggresive subscrition adverstisement.
1,Long delay in delivery,"I ordered on 5/31 and haven't received a single issue. Emailed amazon support, they forwarded it to Future and got an email back saying they will extend my subscription for 1 month; woot, an extra issue, but since there is no mention of when will I actually get my first issue, it doesn't really matter."
1,No DVD disk with subscription,I subscribed to the XBOX magazine on 12/03/01 and have only received 1 - yes 1 - magazine in five months and this was with out the DVD. It seems now they make it clear that the subscription does not come with the DVD but they did not when I ordered in December.Has any else had this problem? I have asked for my money back - we will see if this happens - I doubt it will. I have heard horror stories about mag subscriptions.Don't order this mag without the DVD - its pointless.
5,Viva!,"i first heard the adicts on a excellent DVD documentery about punks and skinheads called ""UK/DK"".Viva la revolution classic.if you buy UK/DK you'll see how crazy the adicts are so mean.monkey was about to hit 2 old ladys with his cane then walked off smiling.but dont get joker in the pack dvd horrible its all just monkey monkey monkey its boring trust me.if you're a fan of The Adicts check out another band called Toy Dollsjust lettin the people that dont know"
1,what you want is the authenic original XITINTODAY....,"A TRAVESTY, THIS RELEASE. refer to my review within amazon.co.uk.nik's original gets 4/5 stars, though. [niktcd333]// nik turner's sphynx - lp/cd 'xitintoday' //"
4,Nice Notebook; Grid Is Too Fine,"These are nice notebooks: good, solid cover; easy to remove (perforated) pages. My only complaint is that the page grid is too fine: when writing text, a line doesn't fit comfortably inside a single gridline, but two gridlines is too large."
4,"Great, but not perfect","Great meter all in all, but Ideal has made a design change in the latest version of this product: Frequency measurements can only be made via a the clamp, and need at least 5 amps of current flowing through the clamp before it can make a frequency reading. Earlier models allows freq measurements via the test leads as well. I researched this product and even the manual that I downloaded from Ideal's website indicated that I could make frequency measurements with the test leads. However, the manual that came with the unit I purchased indicated that I could only use the clamp for freq measurements. I called Ideal and verified this with tech support. Other than that, this is the best clamp-on meter I've ever used. The ""INRUSH"" function is especially useful."
2,Wasn't impressed,"Tried this product before and it was great. Don't know if they changed the formulation, but it wasn't the same. The product leaves my face sticky and it becomes hard to put on makeup. Very disappointed"
5,Olay definity cream 1.7 oz.,"This product is wonderful....leaves your face moisturized; yet with a clean, non-greasy, light feel. Lightly and pleasantly scented. The only thing missing from Olay Definity Cream is sunscreen (which you CAN find in the Olay Definity Moisturizing Lotion (SPF15). Love it!"
2,seen this before?,"Isn't funny how after a while these reviews all seem to be the same? If you notice the reviews for the other computer system's, you will see they are the same. The details were changed, but they seem to be a form letter...!!"
4,Good Starter Computer,"I just bought this one week ago. It is a great starter computer. All I really use it for is internet, word processing, and finances. I was impressed how quickly this computer started up and came to the Windows screen. Though I would prefer an Intel Pentium 4 1.4GHz or higher, the AMD processor is alright for my needs. The video card is sharing 8MB memory, so I do plan to upgrade the memory from 128MB to 512MB (memory is very inexpensive right now) and maybe even add a more powerful sound card since I like to listen to music a lot and the one that is included is integrated to the motherboard. Overall, its good, and if you have more needs than what I mentioned above, then consider another model that is one or two notches above this one. For [more money], you can get one with DVD and more."
1,worthless,"I agree with everything the first reviewer said. In addition, the poorly translated manual is totally unintellegable."
3,A captivating waste of time,"Ms. George is a wonderful writer with a flair for character development that unfortunately makes you feel that you know the characters by the time you're halfway through the book. Unfortunate because they are pretty generally obnoxious and leave you rather less interested in whodunnit than in why the murderer limited his/her attention to only a single victim.Add a quirky heroine who's determined to find out if divine providence for the foolhardy really trumps the law of natural selection, a puzzle over why the Axis would have had a pineapple grenade (""pineapples"" were US; the Nazis used ""potato mashers""), and ...It's a captivating read but when you finish, you'll probably wish you'd spent the time clearing the rubbish out of the garage or bathing the dog instead."
1,Boring,"I never thought I would encounter an Elizabeth George mystery as bad as this one. Her prior books have been riveting page-turners that kept me up all night and then gave me nightmares when I finally went to sleep. This book, in stark contrast, was, in a word, dull. I got about half way through it, and skimmed the rest. The characters were both boring and improbable, and there were no flashes of intriguing domesticity to hold my interest. The relationship between Simon and Deborah is absurd; not only does their marriage seem doomed, as far as I can tell there was never any reason to imagine that it could have been anything else.This is a poorly thought-out, poorly conceived, and poorly written book. I hope that Ms George can redeem herself in her next book; otherwise, it will the last one I buy in hardback (or, indeed, at all)."
4,A diffrent approach for Elizabeth George,"In her latest novel, A Place of Hiding,Elizabeth George deviates from the streets of London and the English country-side as she invites us to the Island of Guernsey. Her approach is both historic and vivid as we see Guernsey from the prospective of Londoners Deborah and Simon St James. It is action packed and as usual one needs to have a sharp mind to keep up with the plot and character development. However, there was something missing and that was Barbara,Tommy and Helen!It just did not seem like an Elizabeth George novel without these delightful characters! I hope that the next book that she writes includes them. The Americans were an ok edition, but I do believe her books are better off with her English characters.I do however recommend this book."
1,big fan couldn't get through it,"I was stunned to read so many reviews that said what I'd been thinking: I'm a GIANT fan of Elizabeth George, but I couldn't get through this! I'm a big reader, always eagerly await her books and eat them up, but I keep putting this down to read something more fun, more challenging, less boring, less tedious--and have never finished it. I don't feel so guilty now, reading that other avid readers say the same. The mood is hopeless and tedious, so there is nothing to drawn the reader into the book."
1,Not her best,"Having read all of the author's previous books, I am disappointed to say that this was far from her best. I found it boring and didn't even finish it.I've noticed in the past few books that she has focused on different characters instead of her previously successful blend of Thomas, Helen, Deborah, Simon and Barbara. This time she apparently decided to make Simon and Deborah the major team. However (in my opinion) they are quite boring when the novel is focused on just them.I also thought the story started off well, but bogged down. It wasn't as compelling as her other tales. A slow go."
3,Just an average toy..,"I bought it around a month back. Snook has fur outside but has motor/machinery inside which makes it heavy enough for a toddler. It's motion is cute but only one step so no doubt kid is getting bored only after few days.Bongo is badly designed and thus doesn't generate sound enough on tapping for the snook to dance in response. Even tapping by me doesn't make it dance, leave the toddler alone but snoock can dance on any noise :) so i have started tapping table or whatever I have near by"
2,Nice But Fragile,"My Daughter Likes The Toy, But It Is Pretty Fragile. I Had To Open It Up To Repair Its Shoulder."
1,The Gypsy Warriors,Received the DVD and when we tried to watch it there was a loud noise and picture 'skipping'. I returned it and then received a second DVD - it too was defective. I returned the second one and asked for a refund. I still would like the DVD but it's too much trouble returning the item. I have ordered many DVD's from Amazon without any trouble.
3,its working so far ......but take with caution,"ok , so it does work so far , i just started taking it two night ago, i did as instructed and drunk 6oz out of the 12oz that was made, no sugar or sweetner just the tea, the taste was a little bad but ok . the next morning when i woke i drunk 8oz of water and withing 10 minutes i was in the bathroom realeasing way more then i usually do. so i was pretty please with the first night , now this is the second night and i drunk the 6oz like instructed after last meal BUT when i woke this morning i had a really big breakfast before i went to the restroom and OMG it hurt sooooo bad ,cramps,a little nauseated,pain and even after i went to the restroom the pain died down a little but still painful cramps...ok so lesson number 1 is to drink water first when you wake up NOT a big heavy breakfastand allow time for the waste to be released out of your body .....i should know ,it doesnt feel to good :("
5,The music and message are both so powerful,"This is my favorite soundtrack. It's my favorite CD ever. The music is so upbeat and when you hear it you just want to dance and sing and ""seize the day""! I love the movie and I love listening to the songs everywhere:in the car, in my room, and I don't have to watch the WHOLE movie!!"
5,"This sountrack, along w/ the movie is the best!!!!","The Newsies soundtrack has got to be the best soundtrack of all times!!!! The movie is so awesome that if you don't have it, I suggest buying it right now!! This is one of the best things Disney ever came out with!!!!!!"
1,Java3D tutorial more helpful,"This is not a good book for learning Java3D. The author buries Java3D in so many layers of his own code that you can't even recognize it. The one useful idea I got from the book was to not compile the scene graph so that I can add and delete objects from the scene during run time. Skip this book, the Java tutorial is better and its free!"
5,I Knew.....,"I don't discover KC after over 30 years of music. It Is always very nice to listen, for dance and parties with friends. Kc doesn't need other words, only play..."
5,Great!,"Just as described! Big. Bold. A very pretty piece of Fiestaware. Doesn't have to be used just for pizza, I would serve anything on it. Even would like nice with a center piece on it!"
3,Very Experimental!,"It seem as though the music of Billie Holiday is being experimented on. I don`t like the first two versions of God Bless The Child at all, but the ""Pleasure Device Mix"" is alright.I don`t know if her music should be tampered with like that becauseshe sang what she felt."
1,Will not provide results of testing,"Nutramax will disclose where the raw material for CosaminDS comes from. They also make it clear they are certified by NSF.However, neither NSF nor Nutramax will disclose even basic test results performed on the product. If you ask Nutramax they will refer you to NSF and if you ask NSF they will refer you to Nutramax. They both use the word ""proprietary"" to describe the result of their internal testing procedures. Frankly I think that is ridiculous.There is no reason why a certificate of analysis can't be provided to at least substantiate label claims (at a bare minimum). Supplement consumers should start insisting that supplement manufacturers be transparent about their entire supply chain AND their testing results."
2,Capsules better than tablets,"I bought the 150 count of Cosamin Ds because it was a good deal, but failed to notice that they were tablets. They are not coated for easy swallowing, in fact the surface is quite powdery and thye taste is poor. Although I have gotten more comfortable taking two at a time, the capsules are simply better. The effectiveness is the same, but spend a little extra for the capsules. i mean I take them everyday!"
3,definitely more romance than fantasy,"I'm more of a fantasy reader than a romance reader,which is why this book did not attract me like it did most of the other reviewers. Which is why I gave it four stars instead of five. It was still a good book with an interesting topic. The characters were interesting, but I thought the writing a bit slow and amatureous. She picked up steam as she went along, though and got better in the end. A lot of steamy sex--mostly through the animalistic sense than human, which was sorta of creepy--especially considering how many of ya'll out there thought it was hot; and that is why I dropped it down another star to three."
4,Tempting the Beast:Feline Breeds 1,"This was my first book by Lora Leigh. I love the storyline of genetic experimentation. It is a believable possibility. Since I like were-books this was enough like them to keep my attention and the action was great. I was definitely reading erotic romance which gave the fight for the good guys a great ""twist"".I bought 2 & 3 at the same time and just put one down and picked up the next one. I look forward to discovering more ""breeds"" in the future."
5,"wow,it's absolutely amazing...","considering this is my first review ever,it have to say something for this book and for the first time I'm tempted to share my opinion..it's a wonderful story,very erotic and satisfying.you'll all love the characters as I did,I was so glad that it was part of a series,you see,I didn't want the story to end.I purchased the feline breeds 2 and 3,I expect them to be just as sizzling hot and yummy..."
3,Not Bad,"This book was good if you are looking for straight sex and not too much story. I read the some of the later breed books first then wanted to go back and start over, but I have to say they got better with time. there is not too much substance here but the sex scenes are good. Don't give up the series does get better- megan's mark is pretty good"
4,not great but not bad,I thought this book was okay. The romance sceens are hot and I do mean H O T but the back story could get a little confusing I think. This is the first in the series and I can't imagine the rest of the series as any less confusing. Maybe it needed more ground work or maybe they are going to bring it around in other books. It was a good read but I think there are others books out there that are better then these.

1,Garbage,No Doubt alienates their rock fan base in favor of a modern pop audience to stay alive. P!nk fans will be pleased. Fans of Tragic Kingdom will be pissed.
1,major disappointment,"OK, major disappointment. All the songs sounded the same. I didn't think the lyrics or the music was very interesting or different. I really liked 'Return To Saturn' - but, this doesn't even sound like the same band."
4,Don't believe the naysayers...,"This is a very good CD. Perhaps not quite excellent, or a classic, but still worthy of one's CD collection. Throughout musical history, the bands that survived were those that were willing to adapt and try new things. Well No Doubt have shown that they are in this for the long haul by releasing a CD that is completely different than their earlier works (which there was nothing wrong with, but really, was Return of Saturn really that much different than Tragic Kingdom that you need both in your collection? Maybe not.) The overall quality varies from track to track, but there are definitely winners. ""Hella Good"" for example, is the best No Doubt song I've ever heard, and probably worth the price of the CD right there. Undoubtedly, the punk/ska purists will despise this CD, but for everyone else, it's a good addition to your CD collection."
2,Couldn't They Have Done Any Better?,"No Doubt is one of my favorite bands of all time, so it was only natural that I was excited about the release of Rock Steady.But when I heard the songs,I felt like I was listening to the soundtrack of The Wedding Singer...BROKEN.All of the songs are very repetitive and they all sound horribly similar.I deeply miss the feel of Tragic Kingdom and Return of Saturn,where they show their true feelings in each and every song.But when I listen to Rock Steady,I can no longer relate to the songs in any way.I also think that the rest of the band(not including Gwen)is dropped in the album.Drums and guitars are replaced with computers(keyboards,etc.).The bottom line:If you enjoyed No Doubt,Beacon Street,and Tragic Kingdom,you will regret buying this album."
3,Bleh,"I only liked a couple songs like: Running, Makeout, In My head and one or two others. I cannot stand to listen to Hey BABY. I liked the Tragic Kingdom, Beacon Street and Return of Saturn cd's better. I thinked they rushed too fast to do this cd. They had just released Return of Saturn and a little over a year later, this cd came out. Hopefully, this was just one cd they just didn't care to take seriously and just wanted to have fun. Let's hope for the next cd's, that they'll get back to the real No Doubt ways.P.S- This might sound mean, but maybe Gwen needs to have some relationship problems in order to release another cd that would sound as good as their previous ones."
3,"Not Good, Not Bad","First off I want you all to know I do not own this CD so you don't have to take my review too seriously, but I have heard most the songs(Here Goes). I love No Doubt and I own most of thier other CD's . This has some very good songs but some of the elecronic songs are not that good, I like a lot of electonic music too but I dont think that No Doubt can pull it off. Rock Steady is sort of like theSmashing Pumpkins album Adore in the sense that the band made a drastic style change and half hated it and half liked it(I liked it). Just no one say I'm not a true No Doubt fan because I am."
5,Gwen and the boys keep on rockin' steady!,"When I put this CD in I have a difficult time taking it out. I hit play and never skip forward. It has an '80's flavor that I don't often revisit and is totally unique when compared to their earlier works, but it is every bit as good if not better."
1,Hella Sedated Society,"Man what a farse. Take a very average rock song like Hella Good, and just ram it down everyone's throats 50,000 times a day on every friggin radio station. Surprisingly when I confront others about the epidemic of hearing this No Doubt album dreadfully overplayed on the radio, the response is always, ""huh, I never hear that No Doubt song on the radio"". Are you idiots friggin kidding me??? Its not that good! You all know it! Gwen Stefani is rich off terribly average No Doubt songs! The music industry intends to make everything 15 year old girl friendly and aleviate people like me who question the fact that all your friggin No Doubts and Outkasts do not care about being different and effective and interesting, ""Rock Steady"" makes me wonder, Gwen, are you the same person that sang ""I Saw Red"" with Bradley of Sublime???"
2,Say it aint so,"No Doubt old stuff was really good, but its obvious all ND cares about is being all over MTV and have a sucessful record then playing the music they want to play. This is horrible the drum beats are very simple u can hardly hear the bass riffs and have u seen the video for ""Hey Baby"" the guitarist isnt playing a guitar!! He's playing one of those weird piano things. I dont like labeling bands and im not too critical of that whole ""sell out"" thing but its gotten to a point where the guitarist isnt even playing a guitar it sounds like a hip hop track. The only song i like on the record is ""underneath It All"" thats a very good song, but the rest is horrible."
1,let down...,"If your a fan of ""Tragic Kingdom"" looking for a worthy follow-up album wait a little longer. Although the music and tone are refreshing and creative, the lyrics are laughable and ruin the album..."
5,A pop masterstroke...,"This album may be the most consistently radio-friendly record since Fleetwod Mac's Rumours... Rock Steady is, fundamentally, twelve hit singles in a row, an instant greatest hits compilation, with a strong cast of producers leading the band through the past twenty years of pop music; ""Hey Baby"" is dancehall by way of a Timbaland-esque rythm, ""Don't Let Me Down"" is pure 80's bubblegum, and ""Hella Good"" is what the new Michael Jackson should have sounded like. The only exception is perhaps Prince's sub-par production contribution ""Waiting Room."" While the record may not have come from the heart, it's forgivably obvious that No Doubt entered the studio with few intentions but to make hook-laden pop music for kids of all ages.Hey, at the end of the day, I like my obscure, experimental, indie music just like any other discerning snob. But I'm not stupid; this album is pure pop genius."
1,disappointed,"dull, bland and unimaginative. I have no problem with a band branching off and trying a new sound. But this is basically 13 or so tracks thrown together with no emotion or inspiration."
2,Say it aint so,"No Doubt's old stuff was really good, but its obvious all ND cares about is being all over MTV and have a sucessful record then playing the music they want to play.

1,What Happened???,"I'm a big No Doubt fan but I have to admit I was very disappointed with the new album ""Rock Steady"". What happened???"
4,Rasta-flair,"You can tell that they didn't record this in a normal studio. Not a bad CD, it's got a lot of singable songs, and a few really artistic ones too. A nice departure from their usual style, while still staying true."
3,"Girls say,Girls say ..., December 19, 2005","This album just rocks !!! Though it's not nearly as good as ""Return Of Saturn"" it still rocks. Even though ""Hey Baby"" was the hit song played on the radio and MTV ( the video for that song was so clever ) there are songs on this record that are far supeior. Like ""Making Out"", with an awesome keyboard at the beginning and a fluid sounding bass,Gwen at her most seductivenes,how can you not resist this song. How can you not? Tell me.And ""Detective"".... you want to talk about the so-called wall of sound. This song will BLOW YOU AWAY !!! Great album."
1,Um... Tradgic Sell Out,1. Rock Steady (Intro) 1/52. Hella Good 1/53. Hey Baby 1/54. Making Out 1/55. Underneath It All 1/56. Detective 1/57. Don't Let Me Down 5/58. Start the Fire 1/59. Running 1/510. In My Head 1/511. Platinum Blonde Life 1/512. Waiting Room 1/513. Rock Steady 1/5
1,What happened to the band,"I think the band even knows this album is bad ,case in point they were performing on Vh1 storytellers and everything was from other albums .They also performed on Abc Family and all the material was from previous albums .They have followed the rule that if your new material is weak only perform the single and songs from other albums . Rock Steady has songs even worse than Hey Baby and that is not good . I love the band so I hope this was just a filler album to get out of the way and not an indication of what is to come in the future"
1,COPY PROTECTED DON'T BUY THIS!,"There's a lot of debate about weather this is a good album or not, with the change in style and all. Personally I'm glad that to see No Doubt is continuing their fine tradition of making each album significantly different than the last, even if I don't like it as much as any of the others.What I'd like to mention is that this CD incorporates copy-protection that for the time being prevents the tracks from being ripped from the CD on a computer. This 'protection' also prevents the tracks from even being played on a computer, and some DVD players (I was only able to get the CD to play on a dedicated stereo or car CD player). I find the fact that it can't be played on a computer particuarly ludicrous considering the 'enhanced CD' features which can ONLY be used on a computer that are included (which by the way work fine, and are a lack-luster screen-saver and the video to Hey Baby). So send a message to the powers that be and don't buy this CD."
5,They Are [Very] Good!!,"No Doubt didn't sell out with their new release. They just flipped the script and decided to venture into a different territory. And it's not a bad thing, either. I haven't bought their CD yet, but I've heard their singles. All three of their singles are huge and I'm diggin the Caribbean-flavored single ""Underneath It All"". So, if you grew up on No Doubt, don't give up on them. You don't need that [money], so just buy the CD. NOWW!!! :p"
1,Are you people crazy? This is pathetic.,"Take another listen. EVERY single song is just a 15 second verse repeated over and over and over and over again. All Gwen needed to do was sing one line and the producers took the rest into making it into a 3-4 minute song. I certainly hope the rest of the band is annoyed - it doesn't sound like they contributed one note here. I simply can't believe this was allowed to be released. One song done this way is fun for parties and dancing, but when you get an album full of them it sounds like somebody just wasn't feeling very creative....This should have been released as a single."
1,Wher Has No Doubt Gone?,"I was never a big No Doubt fan, but I thoroughly enjoyed Tragic Kingdom. ... after listening [to this album], I have dtermined this cd a piece of junk. There are fans out there that will follow No Doubt down whatever path they take ... But let's face it, this cd is ..."
2,What happened to No Doubt?!?,"I can't believe this new album. I never thought I'd be saying this about No Doubt, but I don't understand what happened. I really used to enjoy their music but this drastic change is just not so appealing. Even to many other faithful listeners such as myself, their new record just doesn't seem like it belongs to this band. If you liked No Doubt before, be forwarned that they just don't make them like they used to."
4,The New No Doubt......,"I have been a big fan of No Doubt since the beginning and have loved the guys just as much as Gwen, but I was a little dissapointed when I got this album. They aren't the same band I fell in love with. It's a good album with great songs, just a little change. I guess I just missed the sounds they had w/ Tragic Kingdom and Saturn. Anyone who is a true No Doubt fan will like the album, just be suprised by some fresh new sounds!!"
5,What's with all the dissing?,"This is an excellent CD, all the songs have cool vibes and catchy, fun lyrics. I like this ""new"" style."
4,"It's tite, but different.","If you love No Doubt, you might hate this CD. I love the group and the CD, but Rock Steady is much different from the older albums. Rock Steady is more ""pop,"" and electronic. Don't expect ""Bathwater"" on the new CD. Gwen sings the same, her sexy, girly voice, but Adrian, Tom, and Tony have transformed into a synthesizer/keyboard team. I can't say it's bad, but NO Doubt has changed."
1,Rock Steady is NOT Steady....,"....it's more like floundering.I've been a fan of No Doubt since their 1995 release ""Tragic Kingdom"" which was PHENOMONAL. Return of Saturn (2000) was a mediocre disc, and so I eagerly awaited their next release.When I first heard the song ""Hey Baby"", I was thinking ""This is a hit- the cd must be awesome. They're experimenting with a new style; this is cool"". Little did I know that 'experimenting with a new style (styleS is more like it)' meant totally abandoning their ska roots which hooked so many of their fans in the first place.There are a few tracks which are good- Hey Baby, and the predictable current single Hella Good- which totally preaches of this band's need to please. They used to be an original, inventive, and upcoming band. Now that they've hit the big time, they've decided that original is not always good.So, No Doubt, if you ever read any of these reviews, please take a hint."
2,...,"No Doubt's newest album, Rock Steady, was a big change from some of No Doubt's earlier albums like Tragic Kingdom. The style of this album is more centered on techno and electronic beats, instead of their usual ska-punk-pop sound. Gwen's voice on some of the tracks sounds like Pink, while on others it sounds like Nelly Furtado. A fair amount of the tracks were very tedious and repetitive, often having the same verses over and over again, with no change in the beat or the backround music. Their music seems to be aimed more at the mainstream pop market than any other markets. I found this album dissapointing and not refelctive of No Doubt's many talents they have shown through their earlier music."
2,It's a shame...,"... what happened to No Doubt over the years. I just can find few good songs, the rest is a real waste of time. What I like is:Hella Good, Hey Baby (though it took a long while till I did, Underneath It All, Don't Let Me Down and Waiting Room. Come on, that's not even half of the album... If you loved ""Tragic Kingdom"" and liked ""Return of Saturn"" you should better test this one before you buy it.... you might be very disappointed."
2,No Doubt something is wrong,"I was waiting this new album with anxiety, because I had bought the previous albums ""Tragic Kingdom"" and ""Return of Saturn"". These albums were really hits and tthey show an excellent style of Rock/Pop and spectacular lyrics. But the new album ""Rock Steady"" i guess it's an attempt of No Doubt to enter in something like an ""Electronic Pop"" including hip hoppers (like J.Lopez, J. Simpson or N. Furthado) for example Hey Babe.I felt so dissapointed when i heard the album. In spite of all Gwen remains her lyrics out tthis wave of change.(listen to Platinum Blonde Life)"
1,Steady Boring,"It's official...my favorite ""closet"" band has gone full-on pop. This album sounds at times like a Madonna album, and at times like a Siouxie and the Banshees album (but not a very good one). Musically, the album is really good at times, but Gwen's slow and quiet vocals just don't seem to match up with what the band is trying to do...on two or three tracks. This could've more appropriately called a Gwen Stefani album, and it looks like that is going to be their ticket to success because all they've got to do is make a couple of videos and the album is going to be a smash...indeed, I'm sure that it already is.Color me disappointed."
5,Complete Guide to Needlework (Reader's Digest),I like the book. Has a lot of information for every kind of needlework. Would be great for beginners. Had to get it after looking through my friends.
5,Purchased as a gift,Purchased this item as a birthday gift for a friend who is a bartender at a Devil themed bar. She was overjoyed it worked out perfect.
2,Very fragile - don't buy,The toy is very small and fragile. My 7 year old daughter accidentally broke one off the ears off while playing with it. This toys design makes it nearly impossible to handle w/o one of the ears detaching. I had to buy a plush figure that can be handled buy small children.
3,Comfy but Frumpy,This is a great gown if you're going to be alone. It looks better online I bought the deep purple color. It looks great online but it's a shiny purple in real light. I'm in my late 40s and it makes me feel much older. It's very comfortable but not very stylish.
2,Too little light,"WAY too little light to be useful and WAY too blue to look like a candle. They ARE cheap, so if dim blue is what you want, this is it!"
2,whatsup?,I thought I was ordering a book and received a CD. Still can't figure out how that happened.
1,"Please, no more, we have suffered enough!!!!!","I have never read anything by Ms. Evanovich before reading this so I don't have her other stories to compare to but I can say this isn't a good one to start with. I give it one star for the overall story. If she would have left out the 15 times a page reference to NASCAR in the first 5 chapters it might have not been so bad. But when she misspelled Talladega (she had Taledega pg 104 line 16) it was ruined for me being a NASCAR fanatic. The stereotyping of every character was another annoyance, the Hispanics, the gays, the ""NASCAR guy"" all stereotyped horribly, even the crime family was stereotyped...it was a story full of clichés one after another. The story had potential (if you took out the NASCAR and stereotypes and clichés) but it fell flat with the ending. It was so unbelievable and so forced it sucked the air out of me. And to think this is going to be a series for her. I can hardly hold back my enthusiasm."
2,"Not terrible, but not good either","No this book is not terrible. I have read terrible books. Perhaps if it had it not been pushed on me as PLUM like, I would have appreciated it a little more. The characters are rehashes and ""NASCAR Guy"" got so old that about half way through the book, I just put it down and it's been that way since then (which was actually when it came out). I supose I'll finish it eventually when I have nothing better to do. In the mean time, I hold out for Steph & Lula and the rest of the Original Cast. :)"
3,fast read,Better than the reviews. It was fun and actually kept my attention. Almost as good as Plum and better that Lizzy.
1,METRO GIRL - What utter rubbish,"I am a big Stephanie Plum fan but this Barnaby character was absolutely awful, I would think twice before buying another Janet Evanovich novel. It was pure drivel."
2,Sorely Disappointed...,"Janet has clearly been influenced by money and her own press. Ten was bad, Metro was worse, and who can imagine how bad Eleven will be? Janet has obviously given up any thought of quality for money.Metro Girl was simple, silly, and stupid-- the ending came completely out of the blue, without any groundwork other than NASCAR GUY, whom she insinuates is modeled after Dale, Jr. in talks. An insult for any real NASCAR fan, because the character comes across as a complete moron. If he has any ""hairs,"" as they say in the South, Dale will pull any and all support for this pitiful endeavor."
3,Pleasant bit of fluff only,"If this was written by somebody else, I probably would give it 4 stars. Unfortunately, if you're a NYT #1 Bestselling author, I kinda expect more. Don't get me wrong, I'm a total Janet fan, own all of her books, even the Full series which I find a bit hard to take. But Metrogirl has shallow characters moving through a thin plot. The yucks were few. Usually I stay up all night reading the new Evanovich. I had to work to get through this one. I think if Janet's going to write fluff, it should come out in paperback. Unfortunately, this book wasn't worth the 10 cents a page I paid for it. It seemed like the skeleton of what could have been a great read."
3,"Not Plum, But a Plum","Janet Evanovich kicks off a new series with this book, written in her signature style. The characters are different, but anyone who loves Stephanie Plum novels should warm to this one. The only thing lacking in this book is familiarity, which should be firmly in place by the end of the next Metro Girl book. The heroine, Alexandra ""Barney"" Barnaby, leaves her job as an insurance adjuster in Baltimore when she gets a disturbing call from her brother, last seen in Miami. Alex heads for Florida, where she meets NASCAR driver Sam Hooker, whose boat was ""borrowed"" by Alex's brother Bill before his disappearance. They wind up teaming up to search for Bill, and outrun the bad guys. The chase leads them through the Keys and into Cuban waters and back with plenty of classic Evanovich mishaps along the way for laughs. It's a fun start to a new series with a nicely wrapped ending. I'm looking forward to Metro Girl's next adventure."
3,Stephanie is much better...,"Although this book was entertaining, I couldn't stop thinking about Stephanie Plum. Barney's adventure was suspenseful and fun, but the Plum books have this one beat for sure. Hooker didn't give me goose bumps like Morelli and Ranger do!! I really only bought this book because Janet Evanovich wrote it, and I expected it to be fun, which it was; however, I consider it just something to tide me over until the next Plum novel arrives. I think Plum fans will have a hard time not comparing Barney to Stephanie. I just didn't tear through this book like I did the Plum books. It was okay, but nothing compared to Stepanie and Lula."
5,Metro Girl (Alex Barnaby Series #1),got this as a gift she loves Janet Evanovich series always laughing throw the book anytime i need to get her agift i can't go wrong getting her anyone of Janets books.
3,A quick light read,"This was my first Janet Evanovich novel so I have no comparisons to make to the Stephanie Plum novels. I picked this book up for a light read (as the cover cries out) and I got exactly what I hoped for. Simply put, this is an entertaining book that is at times quite funny. The pace of this book is fairly fast, at the cost of character development. Yeah, the characters are stereotyped, but their actions are unexpected, and the pace kept the pages turning. Unfortunately, some preposterous events seem to just fall into place...let it go.Expect a simple plot. Expect some entertaining dialogue. Expect some sexual tension. Do Not expect a first class mystery and plot twists. Do Not expect complex well defined characters. Do Not expect a romance novel. Don't take it seriously and enjoy it."
2,Warmed over Plum pudding,"I've read every Plum book and loved them, and I was expecting METRO GIRL to be a fresh, new heroine from the cheese-doodle-stained keyboard of Janet Evanovich. But sadly, this is simply re-hashed Plum. Stephanie Plum (hereafter referred to as SP) has Lula and Rex; Barney has Judey and Brian. SP has Grandma Mazur; Barney has Rosa. Wild Bill looked at girls' (...); Joe Morelli played choo-choo. We have doodahs and doodles and demolished cars. And there are too many lists in this book. Every time they go to a convenience store, do we have to have a grocery list of every item they bought? I found NASCAR Guy to be incredibly annoying. I never felt any emotional attachment to him like I do with Joe and Ranger. I only finished the book because ZZZzzzzzzzzzzzzz. Excuse me. I dozed off. I only finished because I hate to admit defeat. In hindsight, I should have waved the white flag at about page 50 and moved on."
1,Don't waste your money!,"I realize some people loved this book, and some hated it. I didn't hate it, but I will not purchase another Evanovich book unless it's part of the Plum series.These rip-off Plum wannabe books that Janet Evanovich comes up with cannot compare remotedly the Plum series. It is quick, sloppy, formula writing that just does not work.Don't buy it."
3,A slower read,The location of this book proved to be more uninteresting!This book is not appealing or exciting as the west coastBooks. They were exciting and page turners. More storiesIn California exciting and refreshing. Washington DCAnd Texas are unappealing due to the present do nothingCongress and the racial profiling of our present administration.Texas is just a lost cause full of bigots and old white menWilling to leave a legacy of hate for future generation thatPartake too much tea which has proven to cause kidneyProblems and stones. Bring Salome back to California!
4,Gorky Park/Eye Of The Needle,Gorky Park is very good watch. Sutherland is very good and cast is solid. Eye of the Needle is excellent. well done all the way through.
3,Disappointed,"For some reason I remembered these two movies to be better than they really are. Eye of the Needle doesn't hold up as well as, say, The Odessa File or Day of the Jackal. I definitely thought Gorky Park was better than this and even though I love Lee Marvin, it's not enough to make me keep it. Hope to off-load this double feature without too much of a loss."
5,Two great thrillers for very good price!,"I love both these movies but bought this for the ""Eye of the Needle"" because I love Donald Sutherland and Kate Nelligan. This is a great romantic mystery with absolutely beautiful but isolated setting on a Scottish island. The other movie is ""Gorky Park"" with the great William Hurt and takes place in Russia and it was an excellent, action packed thriller as well. The price is unbeatable as well as the shipping. I highly recommend these two movies on a cold or rainy afternoon by the fire. Great Seller!"
5,Outstanding!,"Rick Jemmett has done an excellent job of discussing basic back problems in layman terms, as well as putting together a variety of exercises that start out extremely easy and progress to high-level challenges. As a physical therapist I have been trying for years to teach concepts that are covered in this book, as well as create home exercise programs consisting of many of the exercises that are illustrated in this book. Core strength, proprioception and an understanding of what is happening with the trunk are essential components of any exercise program, and are explained well.The only drawback is the price, on par with medical texts, but overpriced for the general public"
2,Ball workout,"You need to be in shape, I agree with the other reviewers. Not all these exercies made sense to me and I have been training a long time with a few injuries to the back and had to bounce back from them. This book shows exercises other books have in them, there are a few that work well for me and may for you."
5,Must Have NREMT Paramedic Testing Prepatory Book,"There are a lot of ""National Paramedic Review"" books out there. This book does a really great job in writing questions similar to the NREMT Paramedic written test. Where this book is really stands out from the rest is in the Practical review section. This by far is the best book I have come across that really prepares you for the practical portion of the NREMT Paramedic testing. This book really goes into great prepatory detail for each station and highlights the common mistakes made by candidates and how to avoid making the same mistakes. Money well spent on this book!!!!! Passed the written and pratical test on the first try!!!"
2,Ok at best,I found the questions to not be well written and confusing. I also found that many of the answers do not match my protocol and use many out dated drugs that have not been used by my department in years.
5,Purchased as a gift,Purchased this as a gift and was very happy when it arrived as anticipated and just loved reading it to my granddaughter . Wonderful book !
3,"Never actually heard this album, but.....","Hey! I gotta say that David L. Smith is way out of line, below, with his comment, ""By the way, am I the only who thinks that Eva O might actually be a drag queen? etc. etc.""Eva recorded a song at my studio in the mid-90s, and has always been a really great person. It was wonderful to see her perform before 2000 loving fans at the WGT in Leipzig in 2005. Needless to say, she is most certainly a woman (why does having to write this make me feel like I am part of a Monty Python skit?)Sam"
4,Hawkwind - 'Lord Of Light' (Cleopatra),"May have JUST seven tracks,but at the time of this release,several of these tunes could not be easily had.Two reasons I'm giving it a four star rating instead of three.First,it's a budget priced disc and second,it has a couple of the original mixes of two Bob Calvert gems from his 1973 'Captain Lockheed' lp ""The Right Stuff"" and the stellar ""Ejection"".Love the way Nik Turner performs this song during most of his live gigs.Speaking of which,there's a tune that closes out the CD here,""The Weighing Of The Heart And Negative Confession""(Travel Mix)"".Isn't THAT a Nik Turner song from his 'Sphynx' effort?Some may refer to 'Lord Of Light' as a second rate compilation.Maybe just should have had a few more tunes added."
3,80's Nostalgia,I saw Rail several times in Idaho Falls during the 1980s. This is a good ticket back in time.
2,Not for thick hair,This straightener has no heat (I've touched it while hot) and does not work at all for thick hair. The crimper did nothing and the plate that was supposed to make waves simply made me look like I could be the bride of Frankenstein. YIKES! The other plate did absolutely nothing for my hair. I gave it two stars because it might work better for finer hair.
1,The Silver Slippers,"I was/am VERY dissapointed in this product. The review indicated very good condition, in fact gift giving condition and that it was complete. IT was not! The most important part of the book is a necklace with a small silver ballet shoe charm. This is supposed to be attached to the front of the book. It was not. The envelop was empty! So the main reason to purchase the book and the main reason a child would love it was missing, and therefore totally unacceptable. What a waste of money and what a misleading advertisement! I also missed the date when it could be returned since I was away for a week.suzannestetson@TDS.NET"
4,True Grit- Truely good,"True Grit is a very well written novel. Easy to get into and fun to read! If you are a western fan, True Grit is a MUST READ!!"
4,A lass with a lasso in this western adventure,"This is ostensibly a Western. Or, it could be a parody of a Western. Or even a caricature of a cliche of a western. Either way (or is it any which way), it has a western theme, gun-toting, whisky drinking, marshal/outlaw chasing, midwestern sun scorched cowboys and a 14 year old girl as the main protagonist who outshoots, outsmarts, outthinks and outmaneouvres them all: how can I not root for her and this book?Yes, its all highly stylised and the climax is OTT (does anybody still use this, over the top? ) but it works and the gritty realism is helped along the way with a rising count of corpses, mutilations, flagellations, shoot-outs and a few gruesome torture scenes, but it never grates: somehow suspension of disbelief is achieved in an imperceptibly elegant way."
5,Love This Book!,"Great narration, great characters, great story. I think it's even better than the movies that have been made about it."
5,Crowing About Miss Prissy And The Rooster,"When I heard that the Coen brothers were showing interest in remaking this classic (with Jeff Bridges as Rooster Cogburn) and sticking closer to the original text, I decided to give the book a shot. Heck, even if the talented brothers don't follow through with making the movie, it was well worth reading. The story is told in the first-person narrative through the eyes of Mattie Ross. The 14-year-old is a prim, proper, pigheaded pain-in-the-backside to anyone that has the misfortune of crossing her path. Her matter-of-fact personality is a wonderful and sometimes hilarious vehicle for describing the odd turn of events. Like all the characters, the language is devoid of any sentimentality or flowery prose. Hard people. Hard language. Hard lives. Hard to put this wonderful, little book down. A real treat."
5,True Grit,"This is a very well written book. I enjoyed it immensely. If you liked the movie, you should love the book."
4,"Between two movies and this book, you will experience ""true grit""","A lot has been said about the two movies (True Gritand the Coen brother's recent remake). I enjoyed both, and I was wondering whether reading the book would add to the ""True Grit"" experience.The cadence of the language in the text was still choppy to me, but the book makes both Mattie Ross, the young girl determined to bring her father's murderer to justice, and federal marshal Rooster Cogburn ""grittier"" than either movie. In other words, don't let the fact that you've seen either movie keep you from enjoying this tale!"
3,Maybe a bit overrated,"Considering that there are two movie adaptions and all, I thought it would be like really awesome. It's good I guess, but I don't think it's the best western out there"
5,The quintessential novel of the American West,"I'd long since enjoyed John Wayne's version of True Grit; the recent remake only enhanced the plot. I hold that the first version is a truly great John Wayne movie. The second, a truly great *western*.And the book, amazingly enough, did not require 'punching up' by screenwriters. All of the classic lines that I love in the film are in there: particularly the iconic Cogburn line: 'Fill your hands, you son of a bitch!'.A thoroughly involving, absorbing adventure with quirky, deadpan humor, True Grit's one to take home and read again and again."
1,Not so great,"This book is deceptive -- so readers be wary. A picture of a mountain meadow and something along the lines of: ""This is the way it could be"" and then a picture of a desert - ""this is the way it is."" The pictures are taken in two entirely different ecosystems! And yet the editors imply that if cows were not present, picture 2 would look like picture 1. Not true.Some interesting writing. Too bad, though, that it was framed by deception."
3,cannot check this bag,"While the trunki is cute and seems sturdy, I was sadly disappointed when it arrived and on the packaging it said DO NOT CHECK. When you're traveling with 2 under 3, one really does not need anything else to carry on the plane. I made a point to look on the trunki website to see if it could be checked before i purchased it and I must've missed the one place within an answer on the FAQ page. trunki should really make it clear on their site.Needless to say I have returned the case."
2,Massage book,"I know the world is changing, but this is sufficient for those learning the fundamentals."
1,Broken after 1 month!,"A sheared shaft or broken cam I suppose. I heard a pop, and now the peddles don't rise and fall as they should during use. Prior to breaking, it has been quite noisy as well."
4,Inexpensive exercise stepper,"This stepper is no frills but is inexpensive. It is compact and easy to assemble and use. The user needs to put it next to something which they can hold onto. Many people would find it difficult to use without holding on to something for balance. The biggest fault with it is that there is no way to adjust the tension or amount of force it takes to use it. It starts out pretty stiff and over time, requires less pressure to push down the petals. This is the second one I have had. I wore the first one out. For a compact inexpensive unit, I still think it is a good buy."
2,Not Worth It,"I wanted an affordable and compact workout device to keep in my one bedroom apartment and to use during the miserable Chicago winter. This allowed me a good workout the first couple of times I used it. Now I don't even break a sweat. Also, the strap around the motion wheel broke and it took months for a new one to be sent. The replacement strap is now about to break. Not a quality product and not a good workout item."
4,Verry Good Overall,Well built and sturdy. Can be a very good workout once you get used to the motion. I recommend using some sort of resistance tubing or bands as this increases the intensity of the workout and works the upper body more. It is fine for me as a 190 lb. male but would be nice if it had some sort of variable resistance. Very good value.
4,Great product!,"I was a little skeptical when I read some of the reviews where people had problems with it breaking, but I am so glad I bought this stepper. I've been using it for a month, 6 days a week and no problems so far. It gives me a great workout. The only criticism I have is that the counter is inaccurate, but I just keep track of my progress using the timer instead of the number of steps. Also, it did squeak a little bit, but I read a suggestion from another reviewer recommending to WD40 the cable ends and the squeaking stopped immediately.A great product for the price. I hate exercising, but don't mind it using this stepper. I've already lost 10 pounds!"
2,NOT FOR MEN,This item is for women or boys only. Anyone with about a men's size 10 or 11 shoe and up -- no room for your feet on the pedals. You can only use this device while up on your toes which is very uncomfortable after a few steps. I'd return it but I wouldn't get my money back just for being dissatisfied.
3,disappointed with the band,it hasnt even been two weeks and this thing broke on me already i mean its a great work out i wish i could have used it more to see if i got results but the resistance band that allows you to step is streched out and twisted so now i cant move up and down the steps go flat down if anybody know where i can buy the bad wire thing thanks
1,Expect many repairs,"In the 9 months I have owned this stepper, the cable has broken twice, and two bolts that are attached to the steps have snapped clean off. I used this product for about 30-40 minutes a day, a few days a week, which I wouldn't think would cause undue wear and tear. I thought that owning my own stepper would be convenient - but the number of repairs required has made it very inconvenient."
5,You will wish this book will never end,"Wilson paints a vista much wider in scope than the limits of the story. He keeps the reader begging for more, creating a fascinating main story seems to occupy only a small portion of his landscape. reminiscent of the best of Heinlien, only with broader scope. Wilson creates a realistic universe with realistic characters. As the pages page tick off I found myself re-reading entire chapters just to prolong the experience of what the author has created. Re-read this book every few years and with each reading you will find more detail, more subtlty and richness. You will regret reaching the final page."
3,Ok,"This book is ""ok"" for studying. However, it does give you a good idea about how the exam is going to be and how they are going to ask the questions. I'd recommend doing extra research in addition to studying the book. Some of the material on medications is incorrect so you better know your stuff. I think the book should be cheaper!"
2,Good for beginners; But look for another version,"The No Grade 1/144 Strike is a very basic model kit that I would almost recommend for beginners, if I didn't know about better options. This model, as I said, is very basic; 2 parts for arms, 2 parts for legs, a body and a head. Doesn't move around much and it's only in 3 colors, basic as it gets. It can look fantastic with a bit of paint, just like in the photo or in the shows...BUT, if you really want a cheap Strike gundam, I suggest looking for the Buster/Sword versions. You'll get the exact same parts you see in the photo of this model kit, as well as the parts to make the Sword or Gun-wielding varients seen in the show, for the exact same, if not a better price. This one's not bad, but, certainly you can do better?"
1,He is old.,I am a great fan of Ravi Shankar but I have to admit that this is probably his worst performace that I have heard. I don't quite understand the 4 or 5 star ratings - this performance is full of flaws. It would be difficult to listen to more than 5 minutes of any part of the entire CD without pointing out atleast one flaw - and I am being generous whe I say one flaw every five minutes. He is surely a genius and my favourite sitar player. If you have some background of Indian classical music you will not want to purchace this CD - you will not even be able to listen to it once.
5,lollapalooza,"As a newcomer to aol and the computer'I tried to submit for the second time a review of HOW TO BE ORGANIZED IN SPITE OF YOURSELF.My rewards for reading the book made me try again.Being a total slob,the info that the authors presented allowed me to change and still be a slob--kinda hard to do but,boy does it work.The extra effort expended just reenforces the rewards.Five stars to a book that's worth ten."
2,Should have been written 25 years ago...,"I had high hopes for this book in that it was being written by a nearly true insider to the world of early Beatles stardom, when they were on the ascending exponential curve of their celebrity and creative genius. Unfortunately, Larry just doesn't remember much. He is eloquent, at times verbose, but offers little in the way of new information, and as another reviewer has suggested, does get some details wrong. He should have written this 25 years ago when he likely remembered more. And the Beatle quotes he intersperses offer little more...comments like ""Its a drag"" and ""Shea was great"" aren't exactly eye-poppers. If you are an ardent Beatles fan, you will want this book for the few interesting tidbits that do surface, but you will become frustrated as you read it knowing that it likely could have been more."
5,A classic Super Hero RPG,"This was the first RPG system I ever roleplayed in. It was simple to learn, challenging to master, and always fun to play. I fondly look back at this as the definitive Super Hero Roleplaying Game system. Especially using the Marvel license, no other ""Marvel RPG"" has even come close to this one. Great stuff."
5,Frequency 99: Greatest Hits of '90s,My Friend loves it great item for people who loves the music of the '90s.
1,Worst example of DVD Horror every created,"I am a extreme fan of horror. I can usually find something worthy in even the worst low budget B&C; grade campy horror movies. However this collection of 50 movies is absolutely without question the biggest waste of money I have ever spent. Every single movie in this set is a complete WASTE time, and each gets an F-. You will only sample the first 10 to 15 minutes of each movie before you shut them off; yes, they are that bad.The video transfer is absolutely terrible (a VHS Cassette played 100,000 times has better picture quality than these DVD's), the audio is bad, the acting is beyond unbearable, and the stories are less than laughable.I absolutely guarantee that anyone who has given this set above 1 STAR works for Pendulum Pictures or is some how affiliated with this Company; this set is not worthy the 1 star I have given it. I only take the time to write this review to prevent others from being COMPLETELY RIPPED OFF!"
5,You'll only read this in school- forget about it.,"Even English professors often admit they wouldn't read James if they didn't have to. The Spoils of Poynton, however, is an enjoyable and easy read. 20th century readers prefer a plot that flies by and, thus, aren't often interested with the snail paced action of James' psychological dramas. However, James' intricate and subtle method, his ceaseless asides, are well worth working through. ""Spoils"" is a great introduction to James' work because it displays his talents (particularly, his character interaction is intriguing) with rare brevity (184 p)."
2,pilates ring,"I am disappointed with the handles on the ring. they are very hard. I am used to soft rubber handles, like I use in our gym.."
1,A REAL WASTE OF TIME,"Arguably, one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Thank God, I rented it instead of buying it! Horrible acting. Ridiculous plot. Terrible lighting. Atrocious creature effects. Absolutely no redeeming qualities. Be warned---this is not worth viewing!"
1,"Hanged once, assassinated once...","Long a student of American History and a teacher of it, I am always interested in alternative perspectives on significant events. This book, however, is mere character assassination disguised as historical fact. I have read every available source on the events leading up to and the trial/execution of Major John Andre, and by all accounts, he was an honorable man. Walsh attempts to paint Andre as a narcissistic, self-serving social climber, when according to those who were there (his enemies, no less), he was a genuinely sincere man who was merely out of his league. He was not a spy, and could not have been expected to have behaved as one. That he held his composure so well in the days leading up to his death speaks volumes as to his character. A truly narcissistic man would have done almost anything to save himself. Andre did nothing other than to preserve his sense of honor and dignity. Where did Walsh get his ideas? I read the same material, and I have no idea..."
1,Oh no,"Be warned, this download is 6 sheets and has no info. I am complaining to Amazon for my $5 back."
1,The Concept Does Not Work,"As a professional poker player, I can say with absolute clearness that this book is worthless, dumb and simply does not work. Poker is a game of skill and talent and really can't be taught by a book like this. Poker players play--not read!! Furthermore, to apply poker to business when the first part is all about skills and talent is just silly. The book does not work and business is more about chess than poker anyway. Checkmate!"
3,Great Maps & History But I Need More,"I've done a lot of research on my ports of call for my upcoming Alaska cruise and while I found the maps in this book to be excellent (including notations of locations of museums on the individual city maps) and the history facinating, what I really was looking for was, for example, what I found out while thumbing through Frommer's 2009 Alaska cruise book: if you're going to go to the Visitor's Center at Mendenhall Glacier, take one of the yellow school-type buses at the end of the dock for $14 round trip unless you want to walk over a mile after the regular bus ($3 round trip) lets you off ""near"" the v.c. Since my time in Juneau is limited, I think I'll be taking the $14 bus...thanks Frommer (and I'll be ordering that book from Amazon today!) May I also suggest that everyone take a look at TripAdvisor.com which has helped me plan some excellent trips the past 3 yrs. Happy Trails."
2,Not A Winner,We bought three travel guides before our cruise to Alaska and this was by far the least valuable. The information isn't specific enough - it's very general. Look at a copy before you buy.
