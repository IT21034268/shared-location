2,easy thinker,"What a mess. Juvenile egomania with its occasional fervid appeal but overall Ayn Rand-ian laughability. The good points--most notably that the scientific method actually expands hypotheses rather than eliminates them (or creates them at a faster rate than it resolves them)--are buried amid macho-rebel gunk notable for a peculiar degree of lack of insight and self-awareness. Quasi-autobiographical road trip format is pure padding. Again, there are several strong points in here (though only a few are original) and I tend to agree with some of its anti-academic viewpoints, but ultimately this says more about maniacal egotism than anything else. Oddball helter-skeleter thinking communicated through many would-be guru-isms.--J.Ruch"

1,THIS. BOOK. SUCKS!!!!!,"I had to read this book for summer reading for my sophomore ap world history class. I may just be too young to understand this book, but personally i hated it with a huge passion! It litrally bored me to tears, I hate this book with all of my heart and do not reccomend it to ANYONE!!!! And what's worse- i cannot for the life of me find a summary of this book, and since i couldn't retain any of this book, i'm going to fail the reading comprehension test when i go back to school. Just don't get this book.."
1,This book is a joke...,"This is a layman's, cop-out guide to philosophy... what a joke. Want a nice, abridged history of a beautiful subject, read this, I guess.... But how can you sum up 2000 years of thought in a few hundred pages? Classic America... take the low road, read as little as possible, take the easy way out... whatever is easier... I think things like this in like are rediculous...I kept waiting for it to go deep, I mean really deep. It never did."
2,A real let down,"A friend recommended this book to me after he learned I was going on a 1200 mile motorcycle trip. I never did take the trip, but read the book anyway.I found his monologues on quality boring and bordering on insane (he was insane, after all). After wrestling with this part of the book, I decided to focus on the trip, not the lecture. Some of his writing was very visual, though I found his conversations with his son troubling and sad, especially towards the end.This was not a satisfying read, though perhaps because it is so highly viewed seemd more of a disappointment."
1,Dull hippie philosophy,"Do you enjoy the intellectual depth that greeting cards provide? How about the careful thought that bumper stickers demonstrate? Are you excited by windbags, braggarts, pedants, and Mr Know-it-alls? Do you drool at the thought of yet another dispatch from the me generation, the baby boomers? If so, this book will thrill you. If not, in other words, if you enjoy challenging reading and original thinking you will find this tome dull, cliche-ridden, pretentious, and authoritarian."
3,Mu,"If I had to say something good or bad about it, I would say I missed the point. What is good, and what is bad? What is ""Mu""? Read the book and find out for yourself the truths about yourself and the world that only you yourself could find out from reading the book."
5,"A vital book, without peer in late 20th Centuary literature","An essay into values that transcends the academics of established philosophical rants. No other book so immediately inspires that on second reading one is looking for the catch. The inter-twining of a dark struggle, an honourable quest and the delicate experience of a cautious man dragged me through the other wonders of the book. I have read 'dry' philosophy before and since and I would rather people who wrote about the subject actually cared for it in the way Bob Pirsig does or else just shut up. Often regarded as a hippy tome this book offers more than any self-improvement manual could ever hope while taking one on a thrilling trip. It has also improved my car maintenance!The best first work of the centuary."
4,Not exactly easy reading,"First off, let me say I can see why this book is considered a modern classic. It delves deeply, and methodically, into the current human condition and how people are taught how to look at the world.However, if you're looking for a casual read into Zen philosophy this book isn't for you. This book took me a while to get through. Much longer than it normally takes me for a book of this length. The ""rhetoric"" can be very complex and complicated at times, but it necessary for the depths the book is meant to examine. Pirsig examines the most basic, fundamentaly, and ancient ways of the modern Western Civilzation thought process."
5,A Very Painful and Thought-Provoking Book,This book is quite a shattering self-analysis as well as a very painful and thought-provoking book. The author talks very honestly about the emotional and metaphysical manifestations and symptoms of his mental breakdown. The book touched me very deeply and will touch anyone who has dealt with depression or knows someone with depression.
1,"Examine yourself, first","That review by ""Woodchuck"" helped clarify what I wanted to say.I read it years ago, and ""knew"" that the author was unbalanced, but also that he held an enormous attraction to many, many people. I couldn't reconcile the two.I've never known anyone who was schizophrenic, but Pirsig's belief system echoes exactly what the reviewer was saying; something I would have catagorized as ""grandiosity,"" with no small amount of paranoia thrown into the mix.In any case -- should you decide to pursue this book -- know that the text is rambling and simplistic.I've read many of the reviews, and those people who were lost or somewhat depressed (or even mentally disturbed -- I'm not quite sure) seem to really enjoy the book. Those people who are basically happy with their lives and mentally ""sound"" are dismayed and (somewhat) disgusted with the book.I'm not disgusted with the book, but with people who recommend it blindly to others."
3,Better in the 70s,"I found the pace very uneven and the author seemed lost much of the time. I wanted to like the book since it was lauded by so many, but it failed to keep my attention."
3,A Critique of Values,"This is a very good book for anyone who's sick and tired of scientists and positivists shoving their philosophy down everyone else's throats. Pirsig shows that rationality and scientific knowlege are not infallible, and that their world view is based upon many preconceptions about the world we live in juat as any other system of philosophy is. He takes about one hundred pages to begin getting to the point, but oince hed does, the book kept my attention. His argument of a tripartite metaphysics with quality as the first cause is very interesting, but ultimately unconvincing. Nevertheless, the process of the argument itself is somewhat enlightening. It's not as earth shattering as I was lead to beleive, but I was surprised by it; it's worth your time."
4,The Three Stooges Rare Treasures from the Columbia Vault,"This is a very nice collection of rare Three Stooges shorts and two feature films on three DVDs. The feature films were good and I had seen them both before. The real treats in this set are the short subject films with Shemp, Joe Besser and Curly Joe DeRita.Fans of the Stooges will see many of the supporting actors featured in the Three Stooges short films in these shorts as well. My only complaint is the packaging. The three DVDs are stacked one on top of the other and one must remove the top DVDs to get to the ones undernneath. For the price of this collection better packaging would have helped. This is a must have for all Three Stooges fans."
3,"lame suspense, rich Istanbul background","I will be very brief. As a suspense, mystery or crime novel, Sultan's Seal is not very satisfying. However, Western and even some Turkish readers like myself might praise the author for reconstructing Istanbul in 1886 with good amount of historical and cultural detail.The writing is at times poetic which fits well with the exotic atmosphere created. Perhaps it is safe to say Istanbul itself from a foreigner's point of view is the main character of the novel.Having said this, I believe using the love for Istanbul as an excuse to write a historical crime novel set in Istanbul is somewhat disappointing.If you can read it without caring too much for the plot, which is not very expertly cosntructed, you will enjoy it. I could not read it that way as I know Istanbul by heart."
3,Why do some current authors write in present tense???,"I'm giving this one three stars because it may indeed have some merits recognized by other readers. Sadly, I find it impossible to read a work of fiction that is set entirely in the present tense, and so my high hopes for The Sultan's Seal were CRUSHED when I realized that this was the case here. I gave up in Chapter 2. I just can't stand this modern affectation, which has ruined several other mystery series, as well as individual books by authors I love like John Le Carre and Hilary Mantel. It's too bad -- what great subject matter and historical/cultural setting. I ordered Ms. White's second and third books in this series from the library, but will have to return them unread if they are also written in this artifical and most irritating manner."
5,Book,It is such a pleasure to receive a second hand book which looks like a new one. Many thanks and keep the good work.
4,great collection,Although overplayed at times and underplayed at other times this is the best (and the only*) beethoven collection I have and is well worth it as these symphonies are perhaps among the most significant pieces of music.
3,"An introduction, nothing more","Janos Ferencsik serviceable cycle with the Hungarian Philharmonic offer a fine introduction to Beethoven for those looking for an inexpensive entry into the canonic nine. However, there is nothing remarkable or even that distinguished about either the playing or Ferencsik's time-beating. With no expositional repeats, dated early digital sound, and a fine, but by no means excellent, cast of soloists in the ninth, your time and money would be better spend elsewhere.Vanska's BIS cycle is a fantastic bargain, as is the recent re-release of Gardiner's fine period cycle. However, in a market glutted with fantastic budget Beethoven - Bloomstedt, Toscanni, Szell - there is no reason to to really acquire this set unless curiosity so dictates."
5,MATH!,I received the book timely. Book was clean and the price was fair. Helped me get a B in a 500 level class whose four prior prerequisites I was not able to take but were necessary.
3,Good display of talent yet very complex story,"From reading this book one can tell that Patricia A. Mckillip is a very good author. Her use of literary devices are spectacular and the story is quite in-depth. I did enjoy this book, but I was very confused throughout most of it. It's somewhat thought provoking yet too far out to actually relate to. Something was lacking as well, I'm not quite sure what it was. Perhaps it's that in the beginning of the book there wasn't much plot development. Although regardless of that it still feels like there is something missing.All in all, I don't regret reading this book. I was just bothered by how some aspects of it are nearly incomprehensible."
3,blue is a patch,"The book is original because it has it a meaning of the time it is written (1961.) It had a great plot. The mood of the book doesn't change fast ,but moved in slow and could be felt.Also, it was important to show how blind people can be to think if they don't learn to live with what is around them and in their enviroment.The book is clear and has many different way it can be felt.Finally, in the end it shows how good always triumphs over evil."
2,PATCH OF BLUE,I don't like this book because I felt like it was missing apart. It never told how Gordon felt in the end and what all the people did. With they gathered around Selina. How did Ole pa react to it? Do Rose ann and Ole pa ever find out about Gordon? The book never told if she went to the school or not and if she met Alice. The book was not long enough for me. It could of use one more setting. That's why I don't like this book.
3,Not a surprise ending,There is a secret twist to the end of this book. Unfortunatly the edition I have actually goes so far as to put that on the covers of the book spoiling a lot of it for me
5,An absolute gem!,"John Muir's writing might be known as long and dry, but he writes with such passion, only those who WANT to learn something will find it beautiful. He writes for scientists and common folk alike (using the Latin terminology for all plants he finds) which makes his writing more intriguing to all readers.He beautifully describes what nature is about, something that DOES take a long time to write because as a writer he must set the mood for the surrounding beauty that encompass his daily hikes.If you want to be introduced to the outdoors, read this book!"
5,Fine Funnel......Make Sure Of Your Measurements,"Being that this funnel is stainless steel, it will never rust or even discolor. Its reasonably priced and definitely worth it. However I do agree with the other reviewer here that relates the difference in inside and outside diameters. If you are buying this for one specific purpose make absolutely certain that what your intending it for can handle a 2 1/8 opening. For it definitely has the 1/8 added to the outside that could be a big issue for some buyers...."
5,the best book,i love this book you should to read it dont just look at the pictures i does not tell you anything just read you will see what fun it is
5,Riding Freedom,"This Historical Fiction book by Pam Munoz Ryan was literally the best book I've ever read. It is a story about a girl who lives in an orphanage. As a 12 year old, she finds no satisfaction in her life at the orphanage in being the cook's helper. Since her parents' death, only one thing matters to her- horses. So she runs away, disguised as a boy, determined to full-fill her dream of owning a ranch and horses. As a boy, she was allowed to vote, becoming the first woman to do so. Kids who read this book will be enchanted by the horses and will relate to Charlotte's determination because Charlotte was a girl about our age. I definitely recommend this book to anyone who loves horses or just likes a terrific read."
4,Riding Freedom,I thought that this was a good book that gave a lot of perspective to what life might have been like for a woman in the 1800's. It had a interesting plot and many challenges for the characters. I was not bored reading this book. I was shocked when she cut off all her hair. Charlotte was a real person who lived in the 1800's. Reading a story that had real people made the story more captivating. It made me feel like the events of the past came to life. I liked it because it was not too long and I could finish it within a week. I thought that the author created lots of different scenerio's for the characters. It really kept my interest. I liked this book and would recommend it for any young teenager to read.
5,Riding Freedom,"This book is about an orphan named Charlotte who loves horses. One day, her favorite horse named Freedom died. She was very sad. Then, shortly after, her friend Hayward was adopted. She was banned from the stables too. So she ran away, pretending to be a boy. She worked for a man named Ebeneezer Belch and then left to Rhode Island to work there. Then she moved to California, bought a ranch, and was the first woman to vote for president. The people in California called her One-eyed Charley because she had lost the sight in one eye. She lost her sight when a horse kicked her in the eye."
1,Piss Poor,"I bought this hopeing for something to learn. I watched this with an open mind. I could tell as soon as I saw the teacher in his basement that this was not going to be much of anything. I watched all in hopes that I could pick up something. I found nothing pratical or worth while. I would advise everyone not to waste there money and buy this garbage. If you want my ten year old could teach someone how to fight better than this.. Yes,it really is this bad.............."
2,Buggy and brief,"My son loves Rolie Polie Olie and I really enjoy reading the books to him, but I've been pretty disappointed in this software title.In short, consistent with what some others have reported, it just doesn't work very well. Despite my system meeting the minimum requirements easily, the software only works sporadically, and when it does it's often herky-jerky with pixelated graphics.It's also not at all clear what you're supposed to do, which makes it a tough slog. But even once you've figured it out, there's just not much to it. When it's working, it looks cool, but the 3 or 4 games it contains aren't anything to get exciteed about.I'm giving 2 stars only because my kid is an RPO fan and because of that has still managed to enjoy the game some. I suspect that won't last past the novelty."
1,Lame,"This game is lame. I had no technical problems whatsoever, the game is simply boring. I agree with the other review that says it's hard to figure out what you are supposed to do. The game doesn't make any sense. It's counter intuitive - a very bad thing for a kid game. I got it as part of a suite of kids software, and I'm thankful that I didn't buy it separately. But, I have to live with the never-ending cycle of my 2 year old wanting to hear the song and see the characters (she cried until I load the CD) like it's a cartoon. Then, she gets frustrated and cries when she has no idea what to do. And, my 4 year old became almost immediately bored with the game when it's pointless nature became evident to her as well. She went back to the Scooby Doo mysteries (which are really good). I think I'm going to uninstall it and throw it in the garbage just to get away from it. It's that bad."
2,Learning Resources IIlluminated Pocket Microscope.,"Microscope arrived DOA. Don't know if it is shorted or a bad bulb. Nonetheless, any replacement costs would negate the original savings. Requesting an RMA."
2,Not Practical,"I bought this product thinking it was just like one I used when I was teaching. The students of all ages loved it. However, this new incarnation is not as much fun. The LED light sheds too much light on the object viewed and washes it out. As a result, the object is not seen clearly; instead it appears blurry. Rather than give it to our grandson who would be very disappointed with it, we put it away in a drawer and will probably never use it."
3,Climax Interruptus,"Very good atmosphere, but a few too many jokes at the genre's expense that fell flat. The radical empiricist confronted by the paranormal made me, at times, scream ""Scully"" to myself. But the complete plot collapse at the climax really hurts this book. If her writing is deft in MISTS OF AVALON, a gentle tour director directing the eye towards all the best parts, she stumbles at points here, resorting to some awkward hand waving at points. At any rate, it was entertaining if occasionally annoying."
2,"It pains me to say it, but","I'm a HUGE MZB fan, but this is definitely not one of Bradleys best. The characters were somewhat cheesy stereotypes of themselves, except for the main character, Truth Jourdemayne. She was just indecisive and annoying, even though she was built up to be this self-assured rationalist. Bad book. I'd have been mad if i'd spent money on it."
5,Gotta Love It!,"Season two was a good one. Our man Tony was his wonderful snarky honest self (but isn't he always?) and the adventures make you want to travel, see and taste the world for yourself."
4,Amazing,"This album almost never happened. The band were originally called Poloroid before the Camera Company got involved and forced a name change. After a blistering debut EP (100 Degrees) the were snapped up by EMI and changed the moniker to Inaura. They recorded a full album with EMI backing and released three singles (This Month's Epic, Soap Opera & Coma Aroma) before EMI dropped them in a 1997 shake up. The band were disheartened and split up.Fortunately, their former record company, Org, obtained the rights to the songs and released the album in its entirety. What you hear is a mish mash of Nine Inch Nails, Duran Duran and Fuzz pop. This album is absolutely oustanding. Soap opera and One Million Smiles are the stand out tracks. All the songs are worth investigating and would sit comfortably in any soundtrack to a fast paced movie. This band and album have been cruelly overlooked. Don't delay - invest today."
4,onion soup crocks,Received the onion soup crocks and tried them immediately. Large capacity and easy to insert and remove from the oven.East cleanup
3,"""Got to be synaptic adheassion!""","The Doctor, Romana and K-9 land on Atrios, where a massive nuclear war in progress. But they must hurry in trying to find the sixth and final segment of time, because the evil Shadow is interrested in obtaining it for his Guardian. ""The Armageddon Factor"" should have been a lot better. It's tedious, padded, and very cheap looking at times. The costume designer must have had something else on his mind when he designed both the Shadow's and Mutes costumes and masks, as they are just pathetic. One confusing point: The Shadow's lair, the mysterious Planet of Evil, is obviously a space station, why then are the interriors of this ""space station"" designed as if he lived in a cave?! But, on the lighter side of this review, there are some great one liners. Both Shapp and Drax provide some needed laughs. Romanna is sexy as ever. At times, ""The Armageddon Factor"" is quite enjoyable, but it should have been so much better."
2,Dr Who at its worst!,"This was a dreadful story, from the Shadow's hamming it up - ""the key to time is mine!"" - to the endless running around in caverns and corridors. There is barely enough plot to sustain four episodes, let alone six. A very disappointing end to the ""Key to Time"" series."
5,awesome,"great soundtrack, very original pacing, style, really adds to the sombering darkness of the series and great to listen to as you work on something... dark and somber"
3,Repetitious,"I wouldn't recommend buying this album except for track 18, which by itself is worth the money. The strings on this orchestral track take you through only a couple minutes of intensity, turning up the volume louder you can hear the timpani behind the spine-chilling vocals that make the hairs on your neck stick up as she transposes octaves at the end of the track."
3,lovely symphony in G,I had been looking for the whole symphony after having listened only the adagio.Really nice.
5,Wonderful Start to a New Series!!!!,"I had the pleasure of reading the final edit of this before it went off to the printers... and I must say that it was fantastic. Anyone who is familiar with the author's work will know that her humor, sarcasm, and snark are some of the best out there. The book is filled to the brim with magic, vampires, and an assorted cast of supernatural characters that are unique and well-written."
5,Great read!!!,"This book is an amazing read. I suggest it to anyone interested in the genre. My favorite part about this story is the characters and their relationships with one another. Ive read the novel a couple times already, and this aspect of it really makes me want to reread the book again and again.I can't wait until the next is published! Go Liz!!!::air fives you::"
4,In Shadowside,I first read this story online and greatly enjoyed it! It's been nice to reread it and see Madison and the rest of the gang once more. For me it's a good mix between humor and horror with a touch of wisecracking and mystery. I'm looking forward to further installments in the series!
4,Excellent History,"I really enjoyed the breadth of this book. It ranges smoothly over political history, engineering, medicine, and finance. You come away with the feeling that you understand something about the people who built (and earlier failed to build) the canal. The discussion of alternate canal routes was also interesting. Maybe this book should get five stars, but I'm going to subtract one because sometimes there was just too much detail so things got a little slow. Of course not everyone will agree on that."
5,"Very thorough, a full historical account of the canal","I became interested in the canal after watching a program on History Channel. This book did not disappoint. It covered the full gamut, from the earliest efforts by the French to the final completion by the USA.This is a very detailed account, therefore it's quite a long book. But I do highly recommend it, you will discover that the canal project was a monumental task that nearly brought TWO nations to failure."
4,Who knew?,"What a saga! The Panama Canal, taken forgranted by many, was the result of a wealth of planning, much of which was fruitless and reckless, construction without the benefit of modern machinery, courage and misery.. David McCullough tells a detailed, true tale, with all the facets of a great story--intrigue, imagination, death and corruption. It is long but well worth the time."
1,Not such a great gift,We received this and found all the contents had a musty nasty taste. We where disappointed and discarded the item. I would not recommend.
4,Full of answers and reflections,"I love Paul Ferrini's writing. There is a peace about how he writes and a humbleness about what is important in our lives. Most of us are very good at betraying ourselves and yet are unaware that we are doing that. This book helps to illustrate that as well as guide us to ways of loving ourselves and honouring ourselves. How many people do that? We may think we do, but unfortunately in our western world that does not seem to come naturally.Dr Gunta Krumins-Caldwell author of On Silver Wings"
2,Wage your own war cheaper!,"I'm an author, musician and Vietnam war veteran with a critical ear for reality. Currently recording a sound-filled version of my own latest book about the '60s-'70s and our war at home and abroad, I went searching for some cheap/easy plug-ins. This CD should be entitled ""It ain't me, Babe."" Even Cher would be ashamed."
4,good for research,"I used this title on my college research paper for a Government 1100 class, and the book practically wrote the paper for me! It is great how clearly it spells out the debates in each side of the issues, and has the debates written out by someone who actually cares about them instead of an impartial researcher. Great for high-school or college research papers."
3,Big is not always best!,"Thanks to Fox to release this immortal masterpieces on DVD! Go on to do so with the work other famous directors! When will Frank Borzage at Fox come out?The box Ford at Fox is much too large to handle. What counts are the films and the bonus materials!!! But it is the only possibility to get most of the films on DVD, so one has to buy all of it..."
3,"Despite the prejudices of the filmmakers, a good look at life in a Kentucky town during the 1890s","In a sleepy small town in Kentucky during the 1890s, an idiosyncratic judge (the Priest of the title, played by Will Rogers, in one of his last roles) defends the innocence of a taciturn man accused of assailing other town folk, by proving that he was a hero of the Confederacy during the Civil War. If you forget the blatant, unthinking racism of the movie (by the end, you have the dimwitted blacks of the town playing Dixie) and its saccharine sentimentality, this film is a good portrayal of the mores and traditions of the Scotch-Irish (or, if you prefer, the rednecks) that forms the backbone of America's personal character. Also, this movie also shows why Stepin Fetchit was such a controversial performer. Recommended with reservations."
4,lots of fun,"I am a huge fan of the Amelia Peabody books! This one was great, but it took awhie to get into it. The mystery was not as exciting as some of the others and there weren't many twists, but that was OK. Amelia and Emerson are, as usual, very humorous and fun. Nefret and Ramses are great to read about too. And the newest addition to the Emerson's... the Great Cat of Re... is tons of fun. However, I WOULD NOT read this book as a first. I would definately start with Crocodile on the Sandbank, or, if you just can't wait, The Ape Who Guards the Balance. There are some things in The Golden One that would give away some important stuff."
3,era voices a bit annoying,even though i love cd books because of my commute. sometimes the actors' voices reading these sometimes can be annoying. to me this is the case of this series. maybe for they would be better read. i love egyptology and mysteries. but the period voice thing got to me while listening. story was good however.
3,Ancient Egypt,"Elizabeth Peters (aka Barbara Mertz) is an Egyptology expert who has created an action filled series featuring the exploits of the archeological Emerson family as they confront various villains in Egypt. Her most popular character is plucky Amelia Peabody Emerson whose adventures in this series are chronicled from Victorian England through World War I. In this novel it is her son Ramses who faces a most dire threat during a time when the Great War shows no sign of abating.An excellent companion guide to the Amelia Peabody mysteries is Amelia Peabody's Egypt: A Compendium by Elizabeth Peters and Kristen Whitebread. The fascinating book is full of maps, old engravings, illustrations, vintage photographs and serious historical and archeological information about Egypt at the time of the mysteries."
4,Amelia Peabody and the gang are back!,"Oh, how I love this series! I was afraid that things would settle down and get stale after the marriage of Ramses & Nefret, and things seemed to be resolved with Sethos, but I was worried for nothing! The story did drag a little in spots, but overall it was a fun read and a terrific addition to the series."
5,Great Idea,"This little card is great. My wife and I can now download pictures to our laptop or desktop with digging out a card reader. What a great idea.It feels delicate, but it has held up fine."
5,Easy to use,A great little card for quick use. I actually bought it to hack my Wii. Worked perfectly. I really like that I don't have to carry a card reader and I can just plug it in to USB.
3,airborne adventure,quite detailed account of training and life in the americanairborned day was quite an achievementthe airborne was dropped at night and scattered all overnormandy
5,Does well what its supposed.,Suprisingly nice sound - very clear with good treble and weak bass (they're no boom box)
2,"sound is clear, but very shallow and weak","I just received these today. They worked right out of the box. Windows XP recognized them without any problems. They work. The sound is clear, but very shallow and weak. These speakers have absolutely no depth. They're almost as bad as my sub-par laptop speakers. I give them two stars because they actually DO work and the speakers are attractive looking. They'd work all right for travel, but for full-time every day speakers... I want something that actually has some depth.The nice thing is that they come with a speaker jack usb adapter that I can plug my OLD speakers into and use in my usb port, which solves the problem that lead me to wanting to replace my old ones in the first place. My old $20 creative labs speakers sound like gold compared to the samsung pleomax ones I just bought.Since I paid less for my old ones and after two years, they still sound better than these, I can't even say that these are good for being cheapie speakers. They're crappy."
5,The Rosary Murders,"One of the finest whodunits I've ever read, and by far the best of the Father Koesler books. This one is hard to put down after the reader opens the front cover. The action never stops, and drags the very reluctant Fr. Koesler right along with it."
4,The book has a different concept with the religious tone.,I have acquired all of The Father Koesler Mysteries because they are very interestingand add a new flavor to a mystery story incorporating a religious tone.
1,"Amateurish, silly, incredible...","The author of this book used to be a priest and thus knows a lot about the inner workings of the Church in Detroit, but is obviously disgruntled and estranged. His hero in the book is what he would that he would be if he were still in good standing in the Church. Frankly, I found the writing amateurish, the plot silly and incredible. The book has lots of gore and everything about the book is unsubtle and heavy-handed and I suppose that is why it is published by a publisher few have ever heard of rather than a major publisher."
3,"Good read, but felt like a repackaging of other books","I like this book, but if you have read the other books by Picknett you are going to feel like you have already read this book. It is not really a story about Lucifer at all. It is the story about Gnosticism in the Enlightenment."
2,The Secret History of Lucifer,"A quite mediocre read, it seemed to ramble and made references to subjects with which I was not familiar. This probably means that I was not as prepared to read this book as I could have been, but references should still be explained. If you are more familiar with the topic, then this book may make more sence to you, if not, this is not the best book to begin with."
5,Strongly recommend this book!,"Fun, inspiring and motivational read! I couldn't put it down until I finished. I am not a big sports fan myself, but quickly realized that I didn't need to be. Great tips that anyone can use in their everyday life. Thanks for the positive encouragement Pat!"
2,UNINSPIRED LOVE SONGS,"The problem with I'M DOING FINE is the songs are basically interchangeable, both lyrically and musically, e.g. I WANNA MAKE LOVE TO YOU and I WANNA BE WITH YOU say the same thing.Hill has an expressive, often moving voice. His biggest hit SOMETIMES WHEN WE TOUCH certainly tugged on our heartstrings. However, over his career, Hill hasn't taken any risks to enhance his endurance.The only real change of pace is EVERYTIME WE SAY GOODBYE, his soulful duet with Vann Johnson.I'M DOING FINE is ultimately an unremarkable offering."
1,dont buy this,this toy is an awful buy and the manufacturer should be ashamed to market it. The squeaker lasted for exactly one squeak. I know it's not expensive but that is ridiculous. Instead of buying this piece of junk save a few bucks and buy your pooch a nice treat.
1,Did I get the wrong item?,"After reading the other reviews, I thought this was going to be a great toy for my puppy.... IT ISN'T! It curly 'hairs' pull out of the animal with the simplest tug! I took it away from my dog after 5 minutes because I was afraid he would choke on all of the threads that were pulled out in that small amount of time. If you love your dog.... you won't buy this one.... buy the raccoon instead."
3,Great Toy Except for the Material,"My 7 week old puppy, who is the same size as this monkey, LOVES playing and sleeping with it. The only problem is that the hair falls out really easily with normal play. The dog isn't even making attempts to shred it, and I keep finding chunks of monkey toy hairs around my house.He really seems to enjoy it though!"
2,Durable but the Squeaker Sucks,"Yes, it's durable. My Golden usually opens holes in minutes but he's gone 2 weeks without damaging it yet.But this may be because the squeaker is very hard to squeak. If the monkey doesn't squeak why should he be interested in it?This monkey needs a better squeaker."
3,Cute but far from indestructible...,"I bought one each for my 7 year old and 3 month old lab mixes; within 4 days both are on my sewing table for repairs. In each case it is the face near the nose, where the fur is short. It looks like maybe it's some kind of knit fabric so if they get one tooth thru it runs and makes a bigger hole they can pull stuffing out of.On the plus side - they love it! The puppy always wants whatever the older dog has, so they run around the house at top speed trading monkeys back and forth. I have also discovered that this monkey is an acceptible substitute for a treat to get the little one to go into his crate without a fuss."
1,Indestructible?,"Indestructible? I think not! My 9 pound Havanese puppy had the stuffing and the squeaker out within two hours. On the flip side, she still likes this stuffless, flat toy."
1,Curley Monkey is for the birds!,"This dog toy did not last even a day before Harley, our English Cocker Spaniel puppy, had shredded it to pieces! His little sharp teeth got through to the stuffing, spreading it all over the house. However, we were relieved there was stuffing and not those tiny little beads."
1,it's not the book it's a 2 paragraph description of the book,Wait! Don't buy this. It's not the book. It's just a 2 paragraph description of the book.
4,A good overview,"I enjoyed the book overall, but found it lacking in someperspectives. It's wonderful from a multi-cultural standpoint, butthere is very little information about rural bisexuals, or those _not_ living out, queer lives. It's a good place to start reading on the subject, though, and the historical perspective was interesting."
5,A Brilliant Piece of Work,"From the opening moment all the way to the end - this is a musical, emotional adventure that is unlike any other album i've bought in years. Check, ""Charade"" for soul mixed with drum'n'bass patterns or ""Back to the Room"" for a heart-wrenching acoustic guitar ballad that twists and spits. Why this guy is not sitting pretty on top of platinum sales and grammies is a mystery to me I look forward to the next album Thanks Rachid."
5,Great gift,I bought this for my 5 year old for Christmas. It comes with SO much stuff. Well worth the money. It keeps her busy for hours and really encourages creativity...a must have for your little artist!
2,Get Christie Love,I have friends that knew Teresa Graves personally. She was really too good of a person for the part. That's why she quit show business.
1,quality,I ENJOYED THE MOVIE BUT ITS SO OLD THAT THE SOUND & PICTURE QUALITY WAS VERY POOR; I THOUGHT THAT IT WOLD BE RESTORED BEFORE IT WAS SOLD .
4,"A Nice Idea, but not much new here","Track 3 claims to be ""alternate take previously unreleased in the U.S."" but it was in fact on the Beach Boys Rarities LP/Cassette in the USA in 1983. It is on CD in the U.S. for the first time, though. The various sessions and instrumental (stereo) are on the 1993 box set, although the instrumental here is a new all-stereo mix. The live concert rehearsal is on the Hawthorne, CA 2CD set. The single version (mono) and Let's Go Away For Awhile (stereo) are on other CD's as well. Nice artwork and mastering as usual from Mark Linett and Capitol."
3,somewhat entertaining but not at all plausible,"A fanciful account, apparently written in 1967, of how the 1968 Presidential election could play out. Although this book was an entertaining, quick read, it sketches out a factual scenario so implausible as to be ridiculous. (If you don't wish to know part of the ending stop reading here).In particular, it suggests that a Republican convention deadlocked between the liberal Nelson Rockerfeller, the conservative Ronald Reagan, and the in-between Richard Nixon would pick John Lindsay, who was far to the left of any of them."
5,Marguerite is allreet!!!,"I read ""I Know Why The Caged Bird Sings"" last year, and have just completed this one. I'm very glad that I have ""Singin' And Swingin' ready to start the minute I finish this review. As I was reading, I kept seeing a vision of Maya at our local theatre where she gave several readings of her works a few years ago. I'm very proud and happy that I've had the good fortune to see her in person. This live performance helped me to appreciate this remarkable woman even more than I would have normally. She is truly a ""phenomenal woman"". If you have not read her autobiography yet, I strongly suggest you start asap. To say this book is interesting and fascinating would be selling it short. As I begin her next volume, I'm quite certain that I will not be disappointed."
5,Exciting NYC Action Flick,The Taking of Pelham 123 is an exciting flick that allows the viewer to completely emerge oneself in an action and psychologically packed drama of the NYC subway system for pure entertainment. The movie provides a Great two hour Escape from reality. Highly recommended by this viewer.
4,"Taste Great, Kids and Parents approve","Some of the liquid Echinaceas taste really bad and some of the pills are large or you have to take a lot of them.This brand works great for us. Our kids love the taste, as do we.The only reason I gave it 4 stars was for the amount it's a little pricey and the dosing is tricky... I think it says it in drops which is a pain to count out. Once I figured out where that amount was on the dropper line it was a lot easier.Great Product!"
5,The best I have seen!,"This is for any luthier, with information given that most books don't have. It's an incredible book that will improve most peoples instruments 100%."
3,Not bad,It's a good buy for that kind of style that looks absolutely beautiful on your feet. I've got the gold one and the blue one. The blue pair is a little tight in front unlike the gold pair. Would recommend it to all. The price is good and the shoes are comfy. I can wear them all day long.
5,My Football,"My Wilson F1100 Official NFL Game Football arrived days before it was scheduled to and in excellent condition. I would like to thank you for the fast shipping and the good quality of this product.I would, also, like to see you open up a line of hand-sewn NFL team logo patches. I think that would be a good collector's item.Your satisfied customer,David Ewing"
4,MUST HAVE LARGE HANDS,IT IS A GREAT FOOTBALL BUT IS HARD TO GRIP IF YOU DON'T HAVE REAL LARGE HANDS AND IS SLIPPERY.
1,I don't understand...,"...why seasons 1 to 3 have spanish subtitles and season 4 doesn't; there is a big market in latin america, we are a lot of fans with the spanish language, we have bought the previous seasons...and now we can't enjoy the last season because Fox didn't add the spanish subtitles..."
1,Steer clear of this seller!,This seller did NOT communicate well. Tracking was NOT provided. Amazon A to Z guarantee was used to recieve refund because DVD's never came. I asked seller for refund but they ignored my requests until they were contacted by Amazon!
1,VERY BAD FINAL,"The worst season ever.....Michael fought the complete 1,2,3 season and died at the end of the 4 season , what ????? are you serious ?????? the writer become crazy in this occasion.....,dont lose you time in this season ,the 1st one :five stars ,2 nd one:4 stars ,3rd one :3 stars and the final one :1 star.very bad argument and stupid overall final."
2,Ended as Soap,"Without wanting to include spoilers in the review, it's just a shame that the writers decided to steer the fourth season as a soap opera. It is pretty clear that everyone ran out of good ideas midway through the season. The plot became less and less believable, and soon was laughable. There was good suspense, and interesting ending to individual shows (which makes you want to start a new one), but that's not all viewers should be interested in. At one point, you will simply lose interest with the weird stories and number of side stories. When the series aired originally, I simply stopped watching and only recently decided to finish - that proved a waste of time.Writing 23 episodes of interesting ""prison break"" plot is not an easy task, and we unfortunately see that in Season 4. Seasons 1 to 3 are really good though, and about 50% of season 4 is acceptable."
3,Wish it was as good as seasons 1-3,I have to be honest and say this didn't meet the standards of the first 3 seasons. I went from loving the show to not really caring during this season. My suggestion is to get the other 3 seasons and skip this one.
3,Intense and Innovative,"While a little slow in parts, I think the story of Joseph's deterioration was both interesting and scary. Desmond Askew's portrayal was awesome. Also interesting to see one of Kathryn Winnick's early roles. The use of flashbacks and dialogue is reminiscent of Steven Soderbergh."
5,"Phenomenonal Album, worth the wait","Sex, Love, & Rock n Roll blew away my expectations of the long-awaited Social D CD. After being so pleased with every other SXDX album and not so happy with Mike's solo albums (especially Under the Influences) I was a little worried they were going to be heavily country influenced. But I'd say it was a good mix of their last two albums. It sounds cheesy saying it was worth the wait, but it was. I just hope they start pumping them out a little more frequently."
5,Great Album From Start to Finish!!,"I listened to this cd in whole several times. I wouldn't say it's an awesome punk record by any means. But it definitely is a kick ass rock n' roll record! It's different than the other Social D records. I would say it's more of a songwriter's album. All the songs are very good and can stand by themselves as great rock n' roll. Usually there's a clunker or two towards the end of every SxDx album but this one is strong and solid all the way thru. If people go into it expecting blaring punk, I think they'll be disappointed. But if they're looking for some really good Mike Ness rock n' roll, they'll be VERY happy. And I think any fan who's followed the band thru the years will love this album. Good stuff."
3,Good but not great,"""Pancho Villa"" is written in a straight-forward style that is accessible and blunt, like a boy's adventure novel. I am not an expert on the Mexican Revolution and its aftermath, so I can't really comment on the accuracy of the book, but any reader should know ahead of time that the book is a veritable bloodbath. Villa and his men are portrayed as near psychopaths with only the most simplistic of political motivations. What they enjoy most is POWER and everything it brings - mostly free sex and the ability to kill at will. The author is certainly consistent - if not monotonous - in his presentation."
5,A great adventure,"Blake does it again! After reading ""The Pistoleer,"" one of the finest biographies-turned-adventures ever written, I picked up ""Friends of Pancho Villa."" Another extraordinary effort by James Carlos Blake. Blake paints great landscapes, and you can feel the both the heat of battle and the coldness of the Mexican mountains in his writing. A great adventure that tracks the life of one of history's great outlaw-heros."
5,Best Movie Ever!!,Nothing was scratched or dented. Good Service! I Would definately from again!!!! These is our favorite Christmas movie of all times!
5,This WONDERFUL movie makes me laugh and cry at the same time!,"They just don't get any better than this! Jimmy Stewart had many great roles, but to me, this is his very best! A must have for my collection!"
4,it's a wonderful life dvd,"movie is wonderful, but when dvd was shipped, discs had unsnapped and were moving around inside the case. no problems detected so far, but i wasn't happy about that."
5,An American Classic,"""Everytime a bell rings an Angel gets his wings"" With all the phones and such in the world having their bells replaced by electronic ringers it seems there probably aren't as many angels getting their wings, what I'm trying to say is that this movie shows the human spirit as it existed in the 40's....It also shows how much society has changed in the last 50 years. This has always been one of my favorite movies and this DVD transfer is awesome. The picture is clear and free of any distortions, the sound although mono is crisp and clear. To all fans of this movie this is a *****MUST HAVE*****"
1,WAKE UP! This is a lousy movie!,"This movie never won any awards. It was so bad that the studio could hardly give it away when they first puit it on tape, then they let it be colorized just so they could sell SOME copies of it, and suddenly the big war cry from the Hollywood liberals was -- ""OOH! Save a classic black and white film!"" Baloney! No one liked this movie when it was made. No one liked it the 1950s. No one liked it in the 1960s. No one liked it in the 1970s. No one liked it in the 1980s, then SUDDENLY! -- it's an American classic. NOT! It's Communist propaganda about the ""evils"" of American free enterprise from a guy who made a lot of pinko films but never thought HE should have to live like this ""common man"" he kept making pictures about."
3,It was not what I expected.,"I bought it for Xmas, but I found the movie very slow. It was not, for my taste, what I expected. I did not finish watching it at that moment."
5,One of the best films ever,"If you've never seen this, watch it. Buy it, rent it or borrow it. It's one of the best films ever and I've never known anyone who didn't love it."
2,It's a wonderful film!,What a charming and heart-warming piece of movie history this is. It's nice to think what a positive difference we can make to other peoples lives without realising it! I am truly touched every time I see this film. Unfortunately I am forced to deduct three stars as the film is in black and white.
5,What if You had Never Been Born? It Might Be Scary,"Have you ever imagined what it would have been like had you never existed--but got to see the events that never occurred because of your nonexistence, other events that occurred because you did not exist to stop them, and to meet the people you never influenced because you never existed? Then this classic is for you. It may bring up haunting thoughts in your own life.George Bailey, the protagonist, rebels at his life because it is falling apart. His colleague just inadvertently had given away $8,000 (then a huge sum of money) to his old nemesis, Mr. Potter. He snaps at his wife and children. The creditors and police are after him. He wants to end it all. But God has other plans. He sends an angel and..."
2,Not so wonderful colorizing,"Two-star rating is for technical quality, not the merit of this classic Frank Capra holiday film.IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE was one of the first motion pictures to undergo computer colorization in the mid-1980s. Results of this process were then at best mediocre. No true reds (they often look brown), and an overabundance of pastels and broad-brush tinting made this one of the color-enhanced movies that stigmatized the process, perhaps for all time.A 2007PARAMOUNT DVD releaseoffers both a b&w; and a reworked colorized edition, and is recommended. If a VHS is desired, stick with a major studio version, as all budget labels dubbed their tapes at slower speeds. Anything other than SP mode gives diminished video sharpness (and sometimes tracking problems)."
5,Color Also!,"Although the giftset doesn't indicate it, this does have both Black and White and Color copies. If you are used to watching this on DVD or even VHS you will be amazed at how sharp and crisp everything is. The color rendition is much improved from the way it was when it was done back in the 80's on TV (before a copyright law changed and made that version illegal to display).The box has a velvet exterior which is kind of neat, and the bell ornament is better than I expected it to be."
5,A Great Classic,"I just had to have this because they're not showing it much anymore on regular TV at Christmas, which is a shame because it is a great old movie...a must-see.A classic tale of a man with dreams that keeps pushing those dreams out further while he takes care of responsibilities for his family; he marries has a great family and once again, a family member makes a mistake for which he will need to pay...probably with prison time. For once, he becomes depressed and is granted a wish to never have been born; he returns to his town and is shown how many lives would be impacted if he never existed.If you've never seen the movie, you'll have to watch it yourself to see the ending...which is really heartwarming. Once you've seen this classic, I bet you make it an annual event as well."
5,An Uplifting Christmas Story,"This movie is, indeed, a great family movie! It is a good source offuel for the Christmas spirit!"
1,There they milk us again!!!,"One movie on which the studio will milk the fans the world over for as many times as they can! Alright, I held back buying the 60th Anniversary edition released last year thinking there will be a definite release of this gem. When this double-disc release was announced, I was very hopeful that at least now after countless releases, this will be the definitive edition of the film but man, they proved me wrong again. Rather than working on the new release, they just repackaged the 60th Anniversary edition alongwith another disc featuring the colorised version of the film. No new extras or commentaries here, so in case, just like me, if you were looking forward to own a definitive release of this wonderful film, looks like you may have to wait a little longer. Maybe for a few more years till the publishing house milks every drop from the fans.A billion stars for the film and no stars for this so called ""2-disc collectors edition"" and the studio releasing it."
5,Great new family tradition,I grew up watching this movie with my grandparents and look forward to watching it with my family for years to come
5,I didn't have a previous DVD version,"I know this film seems to get re-released all too frequently and there are a few moans that it doesn't have much more on it each time it gets released (in time for Christmas no less!!). However I only owned this on VHS previously so it was great to watch it again in sharper resolution. I still never tire of this film and it's feelgood message, I'm only sorry that I was in my late twenties when I first watched it (part of my whole ""I'm not watching that it's in black and white"" mentality as a younger person). If you haven't seen this before don't be put off by the fact it's old. And do stick with it if you think it's slow starting (as one friend of mine did) this has the best ending to any feelgood film ever!"
5,Have to watch!!,"This is a 'have to watch' every year! What an amazing story , each of us make a difference in someones life, even if we don't think so at times."
5,Don't know what 'adychamp' is talking about. Better Transfer & Terrific Color Version,"""adychamp"" wrote that this was the same transfer as the original DVD release. It's not. I actually took screenshots from the same exact scene\frame from each DVD, and compared them side by side. The new B&W transfer is noticeably better. I had a colorized version on VHS years ago that was ghastly. This new colorization is amazing. The color version comes on its own separate DVD. It doesn't stray from the look of early color movies. This colorization has the same color quality of Hitchcock's Vertigo. It looks very natural for older period color films. I imagine the Blu-ray is even better. However, I must note that even the Blu-ray is a square picture like a standard def 4:3 television. That's because that square-ish aspect ratio is the original aspect ratio. Movie theater screens have had many different, distinct shapes over the past 100 years."
4,"To Do Every Christmas: Shop on the 24th, Lie about Santa, Watch this FILM!","It's like a Christmas card in itself. Like the eggnog at a party, you don't question why you do it every year. You just do. It's a Wonderful Life fills everyone with jolly-good, warm and fuzzy Christmas feelings (powerful ending!). Awesome James Stewart masters the role as the everyman champion in this classic film. It's like The Wizard of Oz. Some films are too good to be disputed."
4,Wonderful life is wonderful!,"I have always loved this film and am very pleased to finally own it. This timeless story has all the elements needed to satisfy any movie-goer. Love, morality, hope, fear, helplessness and empowerment - pretty much all the possibilities we can encounter in real life. The biggest lesson, that every person makes a difference in this world, is a relevant message in any era."
5,It's a Wonderful Film,"It's a Wonderful Life has been broadcast on television more often than nearly any other film in history. And yet, even having seen it as many times as I have, it still touches me when I see it. After a lapse in seeing it each year, I watched it last year while wrapping gifts, and smiled and cried my way through it on DVD. The video quality is as crisp on DVD as anyone could hope. There are some special features included on this edition, but the film alone is worth getting the DVD. Presented in it's original 1.33 (Full Screen) aspect ratio."
5,One of the Great Movies of all time!,"This movie looks ""wonderful"" in Blu-ray color. It was a joy to watch an old movie that was so clear. I had the VHS version of the movie; can't watch those anymore! This was a huge improvement!"
3,Not at all like Wooden Smoke,"I found Mike Keneally via his association with Frank Zappa, and immediately fell in love with Wooden Smoke when it came out. I still listen to it all the time. My expectation was to find more of the same in Dog, but it's almost unrecognizable if all you know is Wooden Smoke.Dog is definitely not a dog, but it echoes so much Zappa weirdness and acrobatic power of late King Crimson that it's hard to hear the beautiful voice that Mike brought us in Wooden Smoke. It's almost as if he is trying to prove his standing alongside those greats with this release. While he definitely proves his standing to me, the feeling that he's trying to is a bit of a detractor.Dog stands on its own, but I long for less power and more storytelling. Mike, are you listening?"
4,Keeps seed dry,Torrential rains and blowing snow don't get seed wet in this feeder! And the birds quickly learn to reach up for the seed or nibble dropped seed on the tray. A keeper!
1,Mental Math for Pilots,"I was quite disappointed with this book. I had expected this book to be an excellent source of techniques, easier that those I've learned so far in training, but it turned out differently; I found those I've learned from my instructors (and from several websites and forums) much easier to use during flight than those elaborated in this booklet. I'm sorry to say that I did not get my money's worth out of this tiny booklet."
1,Too little for too much,"This book is too short for too much money.""Pilot's rules of thumb"" has all of the same information AND MORE for LESS money.Pilot's rules of thumb: Rules of thumb, easy aviation math, handy formulas, quick tipsThe typeface is very large making the ""book"" a pamphlet - a very expensive pamphlet.I have been flying jets at the airlines for over 10 years now and there are really only a handful of basic formulas you need and spending the time to go through the entire book would be a waste of your interview preparation time...even though you could thoroughly go through the entire book, cover-to-cover, in an aftenoon."
3,good but not great,"OK reference book. For pro pilots it's a good review but probably nothing you didn't know at one time. It's not a big book either, you could read it in an hour or two. And their is too much basic 2nd/3rd grade math: How to add, subtract, multiply, etc. that was unnecessary. But if you forgot how to figure a descent rate, VDP, TAS or ground speed, than it's a good review."
3,The Oval Office has always had 'em buzzing!!!!,"Published near the conclusion of Bill Clinton's Presidency, SCANDALS IN THE WHITE HOUSE presents a brief look into the scandals that have hit various Presidents starting with George Washington through Bill Clinton.Womanizing,corrupt business dealings,cover-ups,duels,manipulative and powerful family alliances...it's all there,Democrat and Republican.Not meant to be definitive because of it's 60 minute length, SCANDALS postulates that being the President of the United States is a tough job from which to keep your personal life removed.Documentary in style with archival footage,Warren G. Harding possibly gets the most treatment here that one might find interesting;LBJ had a 30 year affair while married; Andrew Jackson was in a duel that kept a bullet lodged next to his heart for life;FDR's mother threatened to disinherit him if he did not stay with Eleanor.....and on and on.Ah yes, the Oval Office has always had 'em buzzing!!!"
5,"Emotionally moving album redefines ""genuine"" music.","Hayden uses a mixed amount of instruments to give you a wide spectrum of sounds on this album. He also employs other sounds, such as a train whistle on one song. These original and interesting aspects help to further highlight his emotionally moving songs. By using personal stories (whether fictitious or not), Hayden draws the listener into his story. One of my favorite albums. 5 STARS!!!"
4,infectious,"My friend mentioned this singer to me with glowing praise. So when i saw this cd cheap in a second hand store in japan i thought i`d give it a try. After the listening to the first 2 tracks, whilst reading a magazine, i thought i ad wasted 250yen. But by the the middle of track 3 i had stopped reading and started listening. Listen to the samples above and if you like the sound of his voice and guitar you will love the whole cd. I am now off to checkout other hayden cd`s from my afor-mentioned friend."
2,Awful DVD of good movie,"Picture quality is like VHS copy and length is only about two hours, not 143 minutes. DVD isn't close captioned and don't have any subtitles too.(DVD is from Westlake Entertainment Group)"
1,Misrepresented,"The description listed this film as 143 minutes, whichis the full version. It arrived with a description of119 minutes, the more common reproduction of the film.It should be listed in the description more accurately."
2,escape from sobibor,"I haven't read the book yet(although I did purchase it from amazon) but I feel the movie gives the lay person a good view of things that happened during the holocaust. This is definitely a very different view of the terrible things that happened. I remember when I was in junior high school having the impression that the Jews did nothing to help themselves. This was the impression the students were given by the teachers at that time. I never, ever heard of Sobibor until I was an adult. Alan Arkin is a great actor and one of my favorites, however, I feel that his performance was a little too muted. His character should have been more heated about getting out.This film should be showed at schools so that the students will know that people would do anything including dying for freedom. The students will learn that the victims did not just accept what was happening, but did what is human nature,strive for freedom. I recommend buying this film. Your wont regret it."
4,Pared Down movie but still good,Escape from Sobibor was a made for TV movie that was several hours long. I showed the full version to my students and they were riveted during the whole time- and it took a while to view it. People always wonder why the Jews did not fight back more and this film shows there were some attempts to fight in the camps.This version takes away some of the power of the original but it is still useful to use in the classroom and certainly worth watching.
5,A Moving Film,"I love this film when I first saw it more than ten years ago in an 8th grade history class. I am glad it is finally on DVD. However, I am quite certain scenes have been eliminated from the DVD version. This movie aired on television years ago, and showed more scenes."
3,Effective enough,"The Bottom Line:Escape From Sobibor is inexpertly made and marred by a ""wide world of sports"" style narrator who threatens to turn the Holocaust into the game of the week, but it's capably mounted and a decent enough docudrama if you want to learn a little about the uprising in Sobibor concentration camp.2.5/4"
4,Kelt Documentary,"After reading a lot of books and megazines in the last year, I found a lot of information here. And the visual about the historical places that really help."
1,"Shallow Story, no mystery and more","The story is rather shallow and not intruiging at all. Although I`m very interested in medieval mystery storys I found this one particularly boring. There is no ambiente in this story, I never felt anything or smelled what it would be like to be in Wales in the 12th century. Much worse are the charakters. They are very poorly made and mere onedimensional. Also, like in an early Western one is to tell good from bad in a second. The good (or noble) people are blonde, tall, muscular, intelligent, blue-eyed and strong willed. The bad ones are dark, small, fat or skinny, dumb and dark-eyed. This, pardon me if it is not so, looks to me (a concerned Austrian)like Nazi- ideology and some kind of Übermensch- fantasy. It reminds me of the ideal Aryan: blonde, blue-eyed, tall and muscular. That is a subliminial message I couldn`t stand. Stay with Paul Harding (P.C.Doherty) or C.L.Grace instead for fun and charakters."
1,They Should Have Recalled This One,Revolting. Repulsive. Turgid. Vile. Nauseating. Did I leave any perjoratives out? This is one of the most disgusting movies I've ever seen. It's nothing more than a big budget slasher movie that borders on the pornographic. How respectable actors like Jude Law and Forest Whitaker can involve themselves in such dreck is beyond me. How this project was ever greenlighted is equally unfathomable. There may have been some dark humor to be mined by the film's dubious premise but as executed here it's just unpleasant. Do yourself a favor and avoid this sadistic exercise. Poking hot needles in your eyes would be more worth your while.
1,Gross and depressing,I agree 100% with previous reviewers that have mentioned a weak plot and dodgy editing. What could have been a really unique story was butchered (literally) with a childish attempt to shock and thrill.Where they were trying to be edgy they ended up being frustratingly odd and depressingly dark.I couldn't even bring myself to bother watching the end.
3,okay not great,The movie arrived way ahead of time but it had to be cleaned and froze up several times before i could get it to play right
1,"Needed women, drama. Pure action.","Think of a future where there are no rights to life, but becasue money buys life, there is only the competition for survival. The better movies have heroes and conflict-resolution.The victims are the irresponsible who are unemployed and cannot pay off their debt. Then there are the hunters who assassinate for money, and their own self-interest. Bloody, conflicted, drug use."
2,I'm No Angel...I'm a boring book.,"I am a fan of Patti Berg's work, but I'm No Angel just about bored me into a deep sleep. Mainly because there wasn't any zing between the characters, and, in general, they weren't very interesting or believable ( a PI who dresses conspicously?).If you are interested in reading a good Berg book, choose any book other than I'm No Angel. You'll very pleased if you do."
2,Boring!!!!,"I had to give this book two stars, for potential and the fact that I could tell the writer had talent just not in this book. The main character Angel is so flaky,unbelivable, and well just boring.As for the male lead Tom.... well he sounds cute and thats bout it. His past is intresting and would make for a great story,the same goes for Angel but I just didnt feel any sparks between the two main characters besides having lots of sex. It was all together boring, ummemorable, and bland. Really just to reiterate.. The book had potential but lost it from the very begining with a lukewarm love connection, a very boring mystery, and nothing much else going on."
2,It just doesn't work,"I love Patti Berg. This story is different from her others, but that's okay. Writers should try new styles and plots. This one is darker and hotter than Ms. Berg's other books.But this one doesn't work. The story and the hero's background are VERY dark. To lighten this up and add humor, Ms. Berg adds a flakey heroine who wears almost no clothing and lots of hot sex.It doesn't work. Putting fluff on top of a dark plot doesn't lighten the plot. It's like putting whipped cream on meatloaf. That doesn't turn it into dessert, just makes it more obvious they don't fit. As for humor, there's very little.I gave it two stars instead of one for what it could have been."
3,Not what it used to be,"Thirty years ago we swore by The Cruising Guide to the New England Coast when we cruised in our Tartan 41. However, technology has increased the ability to receive the latest data. It would be good if the folks who bring us this Cruising Guide would have a web site to give us the latest information on the dredging of channels, great places to buy fish, etc. The book is outdated. However, it was a good read."
5,Great documentary,"I love this documentary, it is very well done you can feel the human essence and the emotions the go thru."
5,great...inspiring,"If you have been teetering on the edge of veganism...wanting to, but not quite able to commit, this documentary will help you move a step forward."
4,Great educational Video,"This video is really good for teaching people that know nothing about vegetarians and vegans. IT gives you insight to animal cruelty, how a diet high in vegetables can greatly benefit you, and doesn't shove veganism down your throat."
2,A Vegan recruitment film.,"This documentary is old news unless you were born yesterday. It mundanely plays the animal-cruelty card and promotes meat and dairy products as major health hazards; so what else is new? Typical of homemade documentaries, it's childishly manipulative and simpleminded in its intention. The cutesy-poo director does a lot of yammering that leads to bigger questions about population control and global industrialization, which are neglected with convenient conviction. Are people really dying off too quickly in the new millenium? Is there any evidence that vegans are more sympathetic or less cruel than carnivorous consumers? Is being a vegan more rational than not? Is vegan recruiting stupid?In the end, moderation in all things seems to be the simple solution. You won't be missing too much if you want to pass this one up."
1,Disappointing,"I thought this movie was going to be on the level of Forks over Knives but this one wasn't even close. To summarize a girl in college attempts to convert you and the individuals in the movie to become vegans. That's pretty much it. The film gets worse as it attempts demonize the animal based farming industry. It does so by taking some of the bad things that a very few have done and presenting it as the standard in the industry.The documentary is very bias, and does a poor job of presenting the positives of eating plant based diet. If you want to become Vegucated watch Forks over Knives."
1,Mostly Propaganda,"It started out promising, and she's a talented documentary writer, but it's basically propaganda. After realizing that, we thought of it as a comedy and had much more fun finishing it."
1,Not very informative,"The science is laughable, the slant is clear from the first 5 minutes of the film and the politics is everywhere."
2,This movie needs to be RATED for viewer caution,"I was not at all prepared for the pure GRAPHICNESS of this film. This film should be rated at least PG-13 if not R. I did not see a rating on it at all, and I looked. While the film was great and impactful, it was also horrific and I was NOT prepared to see it and was very upset. I did not need to see those level of graphics to get the point across, and even if I did, I REALLY could have used a ""viewer discretion advised."" PLEASE, PLEASE provide a warning on this. It WAS violent and awful. Showing graphic animal slaughter and unmedicated castrations was just, awful, and leaves me not upset at the people doing it, but the people who failed to warn me before I turned this on. I was just NOT prepared, and very relieved I did not allow a child to watch it.That said, it seems great, complete information, very persuasive. But the graphics... The graphic content was WAY too much."
1,Just Plain Bad,"The show started out as you would expect a decent documentary to; a little background and character introduction. The big problem with the film is that it rapidly descended into a poorly made film full of scare tactics. I respect the views of vegans, as a vegetarian I sympathize with the plight of informing the public of the issues surrounding CAFO's, chicken ranches, etc. The movie is not comedy, and it is not helpful to the plight, I was completely disgusted by several scenes that seemed to be spliced in to surprise. The scenes did not fit in sequence; they seemed to be there catch you off guard so that you weren't ready to fast forward through pigs convulsing after being shot or cattle, still moving, dangling from meat hooks. I will not finish the movie and I would not recommend it to anyone. The graphic scenes serve a purpose, but they drive people away from the concept. Don't watch, especially if you are looking for a comedy!"
2,fake pic,"hey dude, ur shipping and stuff was great but u the picture u have up there indicate that there is 4 lights in tha fan... but it only has 3, get the right picture man... its not kool to get wat u didnt wanted to buy... other than that, was a pleasure doin business"
3,Reader's Digest Version,"Unfortunately, I ""listened"" to what most of the other evaluators wrote about this book and purchased it. Believing I was buying a book that was going to be as insightful as some of the other classics on the Eastern Front, I was somewhat disappointed. If you are looking for an account of someone fighting against the Russian's during World War II, read Voss, Sajer, or Knappe. If you want to read about the Russian concentration camp system, read Solzhenitsyn. If you just want something to read to pass the time, then, and only then, read this book."
5,I almost missed out...,"...on reading one of my new favorite books, Oil Notes. I was not interested in reading a book about oil. Fortunately, after much convincing, I read the book and loved it. It is a beautiful book about Bass's passion for life, the outdoors and geology. It is my favorite Rick Bass book by far, and it has a permanent place on my book shelf. Don't make the mistake that I almost did...buy it, borrow it or whatever...Just don't miss out on this wonderful book."
3,He missed visiting Bank one Ballpark!!,"I picked this book up as a gift for someone who has talked about traveling to visit all ballparks over the next few years. Enjoyed reading about some of the ballparks that I have recently visited, but was disappointed to see that while this book was reveised in 2001, he did not visit BOB in Phoenix. The information is all pre-opening and is even written as if the park is not yet opened. Good discriptions of Pac-Bell and Safco field both which opened after BOB."
2,unfortunately very boring,"i'm a fan of typically hitchcock's earlier (30s) and later (50s-70s) work, but this classic just didn't cut it with me. extremely boring despite some good acting, cinematography and directing. the script is extremely lukewarm however and wants you to sit through absolute nothingness forever!! i would not recommend this one, but i'm sure friends of yours already have. oh well.."
4,"A bit slow, but entertaining","Rear Window is somewhat languidly paced, lacking the taut direction of some of Hitchcock's best films (Notorious, North by Northwest, Dial M for Murder, etc.), and this one-set movie does start to feel claustrophobic. I was hoping for Stewart to be able to get out of that wheelchair, leave his small apartment with the oversized lamp shade, and get out into the world.The climax was a bit disappointing. It is chilling to hear Burr coming up the stairs, but once he comes in to the apartment he just starts asking questions -- that's not too scary! And he doesn't even have a weapon on him!It's not one of Hitchcock's best films, but it still is interesting and entertaining."
5,Wonderfully Made! The best of Hitchcock!,"this is one of the best films ever made. i sugjest, for those who haven't seen any other films by Hitchcock, Psycho, Vertigo and the Lady Vanishes. Of course all of his other films are brilliant but those are good for a start!"
1,"Couldn't get this streaming to play, so I had to view the HD version at a higher cost!!!!","I love this old movie but as I said above, that particular day I could not get the regular version to stream."
4,Rear Window,"I received the DVD in a timely fashion. It was as I remembered it: a very good film, One of Hitchcock's best. Only criticism : although it claimed to be digitally remastered the Definition was not as good as I was expecting, but I still enjoyed it."
5,Never tires,"Of Hitch's ""big four"" (Vertigo, North by Northwest, Psycho, Rear Window) this is the one that has aged the most gracefully. Perhaps this is because it is the simplest story of all his classics. Rear Window finally gets the royal treatment with a DVD collector's edition. Hurray! Jimmy Stewart is just a master of the everyman. His plodding style suits Hitch's slow build-up incredibly well both here and in Vertigo."
5,Before most people had a television...,"A trip back in time more entertaining than many current computer and action driven films. Nail biting conclusion. And not one of the apartments viewed through Jimmy Stewart's ""rear window"" had a television. Take a break from our hyper-wired and networked society and spend a couple of hours with a stunning Grace Kelley (cosmetic tweaking and enhancement-free) and an endearing Jimmy Stewart as they unravel a murder."
1,Worth $0.02,"This book will do very little in giving you an idea of how to grow a practice, or not have it fail. It talks a lot about cloning yourself and selling your practice eventually, which is something I'm not interested in - at least not now - it's been 3 years since I graduated. There is nothing substantial about doctor-patient communication or patient acquisition, which I believe has a lot to do with why practices fail. The reason I would pay $0.02 and rate it a 1 star is because it has some decent philosophical concepts, but you can get those just about anywhere with all ""self-help"" manifestation-type books that are out now. The author probably had a good 1st book (haven't read it) and then just figured he could use the same template to clone a dozen others on a different topic. Invest your money elsewhere - really disappointing, and was able to finish it about 2 hours. And I'm no speed-reader."
2,Disappointing,"The book is a quick read, but honestly did not provide solutions. Sure it discussed problem areas, but pretty much the book just identified what the problems are. I already know what they are. For example, in the section regarding problem patients I thought that it would address how to handle a variety of ""problem"" patients. No, it just skimmed over the topic offering no new information. I don't think I really gleaned any pearls of wisdom from this book. I'm just happy that I didn't waste more time, as it was a quick read. Overall, I was very disappointed."
2,fluff,"I thought that the first couple of chapters were enticing at first. Then I realized that this book was really all fluff. Basically, a pep talk to get you to do what you want. He fails to address so many issues and has a very simplistic attitude towards them.He starts off saying that doctors who want to go off on their own do, so that they can rid themselves of a boss who is controlling and runs everything. However, he then explains how later on, you have to hire doctors and basically train them to be a replica of yourself. I see a problem there. Because unless you hire followers, doctors want to have their own autonomy. How does he address this problem that made the doctor go off on his own in the first place?Basically a fluff book. read it in the book store."
1,Cardboard Comb!,"This comb was made out of cardboard! I had to return it, it was almost funny. $10 for a cardboard comb. Toppik is a good product but this is a joke. The picture makes you think it is plastic or something. Don't get the carboard comb wet or it will break...."
3,"Another Life, Another Story","Another Life is an interesting book. It contains many gossipy, juicy facts that are fun to read, but some of them surprised me. Korda says he was responsible for making Jackie Susann a best selling author with Valley of the Dolls, but in fact he edited her second book, The love Machine (which is not even mentioned in Another Life). I read Barbara Seaman's Lovely Me, The Life of Jacqueline Susann, and found far more information than in the article. Seaman has used great sources, Jackie's friends and family memebers, for her biography. It seems like Korda skipped and changed some parts in order to make a story. If you want the true story of Jackie, check out Lovely Me."
5,A Life in Books and Publishing,"What a wonderful tour guide Korda turns out to be in this ultimate insider's look at trade publishing in the last half of the American Century. He's smart, self-deprecating, generous and altogether enthusiastic about his life's work and times. Almost every page of this book features an anecdote about a publishing legend. The publishing behind-the-scenes stuff is fascinating. If you've wondered where the more romantic notions people have about authors and their editors come from, this book will explain much. Korda is like a very entertaining teacher, and beneath the fun lies an inspiring, dedicated, hard-working, dues-paying professional. I would think this is a must read for anybody interested in publishing today."
1,Bad Re-recording,"I ordered this CD specially for ""The Last Farewell"" - a favorite of my husband and I for many years. How disappointing that the beginning is garbled beyond being able to understand the words..."
4,Roger Whittaker - Greatest Hits,I love Roger's voice. I was looking for a CD with the songs I really liked. This one has the most of my favorites.
1,Bad Disc,The disc was bad. We ran it through three different machines and it performed badly each time. The sound was scratchy and inaudible and the picture was digitally disruptive.
1,No ENGLISH closed captions for the hearing impaired,"NO ENGLISH CLOSED CAPTION FOR THE HEARING IMPAIRED. WOULD HAVE LIKED TO HAVE SEEN THIS MOVIE. OH WELL.WHEN ARE YOU GUYS - THE PRODUCTION COMPANIES GOING TO WAKE UP?But got this one anyhow and turned it up louder than loud. Hugh Jackman can sing for me anytime, as well as the man who played Judd. yummy.The blonde girl in the chorus can really sing and should have the part of Laurie. the girl who played Laurie was ok but the other girl was way better. She has a Beautiful, sweet, clear voice and is better looking too."
4,Nice musical,\it is a lovely musical with professional actors well mimicking hardship of US history of the time pioneering.Once to see good enough.
4,Read the book it's better.,I loved this movie because it is harder to visualize this monster in my head then it would be just watching the movie. But for a good suspenseful read just pick up the book it is a lot cheaper then the movie.
1,actualy a half a star,"This movie is a disapointment. The only good thing about it is the special effects. If yuo like cheesy horror movies, or great special, effects watch it. Otherwise skip it.The novel is great though."
3,Pretty Good Remake of Jaws.,"This is a Hyper Remake of Jaws made for Television by National Broadcast Company (Filmed in 1995), aired on T.V. in 1996. Based on the Best Selling Novel by Peter Benchely, who also Wrote the Book-Jaws. Instend of a Shark, This one is a Tentacied Killer. This is more Fantasy than Reality, the film has a fine cast including:William L. Petersen, Charles Martin Smith and Larry Drake. Originally made as a Two Part Mini-Series. Grade:B."
5,A New Venture into the Acoustic World,"Days of the New has put together an album of tremendous songs, all of which could be single material, with the possible exception of ""How Do You Know You"" and ""Cling."" ""Now"" and ""Solitude"" could have been as popular as ""The Down Town"" and ""Shelf in the Room"" if they were released as the next singles. Nevertheless what is plain to hear here is the extraordinary musicianship of three men with instruments and a plan to remain based in the acoustic side of things. At certain times, the music comes across as heavy and intense, which is no easy feat for acoustic instruments. The songs here are an excellent blend of light and shade together to create a new venture into the acoustic world."
4,Good debut.,"My brother got me this album gor christmas. I'm more of an Iced Earth and Dream Theater fan, but I decided to give it a spin. This is weird. It's like grunge, but with acoustic guitars. I still like it. My favorites are the singles, actually. Touch, Peel, & Stand, and The Down Town are my favs. I like the jam song at the end. I was hoping for the singer to not have a Pearl Jam voice, but I don't mind. At times he sounds like James Hetfield. Really cool stuff."
4,A few good songs but im sorry to say the rest isnt too good,"i heard touch, peel, and stand on the radio then i went out and bought the cd. i like shelf in the room, touch peel and stand, and the down town. but i have to say that even if i knew all the songs i still would have wanted to get this cd. the few songs that i really like make up for the rest. i listen to them a lot then switch to another one of my cds."
5,If you love guitars...,"I love the song ""DownTown"" for the melodic use of the acoustic guitars. I brought the CD just for that song. It just ""kicks"" along. The vocals are wonderful too. I love playing my guitar and singing along. The music tends to ""drone"" along toward the end of CD but still, a good listen. If you like ""Alice in Chains"" then you will probably like this particular CD by ""Days of the New"" A must have if you love the sound of many acoustic guitars playing at once."
1,"Days of the old, reheated, and refried.","These guys are trying way too hard to be Alice in Chains. I'm not a big Alice in Chains fan, but I'm sure that would be an insult. These guys have failed to escape the mold of your average white band and seemed to doomed to a mediocre musical career. Watch for these future window cleaners on the carwash tour (along with all of the other average bands out there that take themselves too seriously, namely the Seven Mary Threes and the Ass Ponies and The Dishwalla)."
3,If acoustic's not your cup of tea.... steer clear!,"I bought a copy of this CD in April with high hopes stemming from the single from it the radio stations were playing at the time. You have to understand that I'm not one to purchase much that has a copyright date after 1985, so therefore I must have had VERY high hopes! Well, after about 3 or 4 songs I began to realize that everything was sounding the same and I was beginning to think of how Gramma was doin' back in Indiana! Yeah, not real exciting stuff! It did grow on me a little after a couple of repeated plays (which I always force out of myself after spending $15 on a new CD). Otherwise I would have stopped at 2 stars here. But, with so much complete crap polluting our airwaves these days, I can't bring myself to really dis this one. This means you, Marilyn!."
3,Meh... they're ok.,"The shakers are much larger in real life than they look, about 2.5"" in diameter. Filling is done via chintzy plastic plug on the bottom... no screw on lids or bases here. The salt and pepper shakers get clogged from time to time, and the other shakers are just there for looks in my kitchen (thanks to a lack of covers for the exposed tops). Overall, they work well as a decorative set, but I'd look elsewhere for a more practical seasoning storage solution that will be used daily. Not bad for the price, though, considering what you'd pay for them retail."
2,Disappointed,"I originally saw this film years ago on late night television, I think during the 1970s. Even at this late date, some of the movie remained in my memory, so when the video I bought through Amazon came, I thought I had something remarkable in hand. It's remarkable, all right. Some hack with a low IQ cut the entire scene in which Dr. Werdegast flays Poelzig alive! You get to miss the entire mad rant of revenge as only a Bela Lugosi could have delivered it, all suggested by the writhings of shadows on a wall -- this is great art, not a grade-z slash flick! If this was good enough to show on television going on 30 years ago, why is it too bad to include in the video? So beware, if you buy this video, you will emphatically not be getting your money's worth."
4,Roger Whittaker does Christmas music with his own fantastic style.,I bought this as a cassette many years ago. The CD I bought for my daughter because she was wearing the cassette out. And now her children are enjoying his music as well.
5,The Very Best Christmas CD,I first bought this as a record album in the 1980's. When Ibought a CD player - the very first CD I purchased was this oneand it was summertime! The songs were written and recorded by Roger Whittaker. I have about 55 Christmas CDs now but this is my all-time favorite. Roger's other Christmas CDs areexcellent but this is the very best!
5,A Favorite!,"Roger Whittaker can take a classic or a song I've never heard before and make it a favorite with me. His mellow voice and timing are sooo perfect.This contains my all-time favorite Whittaker holiday song, ""Christmas is here again."" Ponder these words:""All that I want is to be here beside you,All that I need is right here in my arms,All that I want is to know that you love me,And this will be my finest Christmas time.""Play this for your loved ones with the Christmas tree lights twinkling and a cup of cocoa in hand."
5,5 Love Languages CD,"This information is probably the best practical approach to understanding the problems with relationships yet offered.Someone told me a long time ago...""people do things for their own reasons""...this information causes you to look practically and take the time to investigate how your spouse or girlfriend may be seeing things from her perspective...until you at least become aware of this fact of life, you'll never really understand why others do what they do....great stuff...I listen to it over and over again as I travel in my business activities...it can apply to any relationship....even your relationship with God."
3,Ambitious Soap Opera,Sandwiched smack dab in the middle of Douglas Sirk and Dallas/Dynasty eras comes this trashy Nazi parable. The plot could have used a little tightening up and the acting absolutely toned down. A schemer for the family business barks his lines like a Doberman. The real heir and his mother are so exaggerated we cannot take them seriously even as symbolism.
4,Xmas classics plus 40's swing/big band remixes=favorite CD,"Everyone needs a CD or two of holiday music to put on in the background over dinner or during a party. This one has lots of the classics- Jingle Bells, O Christmas Tree etc, but it also starts and ends with some truly superb big band remixes of The Nutcracker Suite, by the Les Brown Orchestra (a long track that sumarizes most of the entire thing) and, shorter and hotter, the Dance of the Sugar Plum Faries by the Larry Clinton Orchestra.If you like Benny Goodman, Charlie Christian, Jango Rheinhardt, this will be the best money you've ever spent."
2,Owen Hart died,I guess i never gave this show a chance. Once owen hart died the whole show was just meaningless to me. Owen was a great showman and died trying to please his fans. I will always remember Owen Hart....
3,pretty good,"This was a descent WWF PPV. Here is how I rate the matches: Match 1- LOD 2000 VS DOA: 7 out of 10 because it was a good opening bout, but kinda long. Match 2- Steve Blackman VS Jeff Jarret: 4 out of 10, because it was too long. Match 3: Taka Michinoku, and Bradshaw VS Kaientai: 7 out of 10, because of the high-risks. Match 4: Sable VS Marc Mero: 3 out of 10, because I thought it would be semi-long. Match 5: Vader VS Kane: 8 out of 10, because it was a pretty good match. Match 6: Rock VS Faarooq: 8 out of 10, because it was good. Match 7: DX VS Nation: 4 out of 10, because it was very boring. Match 8: Steve Austin VS Dude Love: 9 out of 10, because it was a good hardcore match.(If you wanna see a better one, watch Vince VS HHH at Armageddon). Overall, a pretty good PPV."
4,A book that is like peanuts.,"Read just one article! I dare you. Tale after tale about the marginal people and events of history. It sucks you on and on, page after page. Although I knew many of the stories, never in such detail, dispassionately told. I'm giving copies to my trivia friends for Christmas."
2,Not worth my time,Very little infrmation is contained in this biography. They focus more on her books than her life.
2,bland and tedious mystery,"I had never read a Paul Turner mystery and I doubt that I ever will read another one. This was a terrible book, tedious to read. Like many of the characters Zubro creates for this book, Zubro's writing is mildly interesting at best. Long lines of characters addressing the same issues...hardly the epitome of creativity."
2,Breaks easily,I've repurchased this five times in 3 years to mount my GPSMAPS 60 to my road bike. With potholed roads the plastic lip didn't hold up to the shock. Make sure you use a safety tether to the bike or you may drop your GPS going over railroad tracks or potholes! To reduce the load on the mount lips use a shoe lase to secure the GPS clip to the adapter on handlebars. Finally upgraded my GPS to an Edge 800 much lighter and different mount.
4,An absolute delight,"""I am the sanest man alive,"" Bela Lugosi says at one point in ""The Raven."" ""But,"" Bela says, ""I will not be tortured."" Of course, he isn't sane at all, and neither is most of this movie which is why it is so darned enjoyable. This second teaming of horror greats Karloff (billed by surname only) and Lugosi is an absolute delight. It may not have the haunting and unforgettably morbid ambience of ""The Black Cat,"" but it never slows down either. This is one to see again and again."
4,Short and sweet - It's worth buying if you like RPG's.,"It's an interesting example of how far you can take a system, it's a well-done RPG on its own merits, and having played it now I can say it's easy to run. I enjoyed it and recommend it."
1,Pathetic Remakes,"All of these songs are remakes made in the 70s. They are not the original recordings. Sadly, neither this web site's description nor the packaging of the set informs customers of this. The fact that these are remakes becomes clear only after you open the first CD in the set and read the liner notes. Since this web site won't allow returns of opened CDs, I want to warn others so they aren't ripped off too. The remakes aren't even faithful to the R&B genre: many of the arrangements are more 70s Soul than R&B."
3,Not for the whole family.,"I've purchased many of the BBC series, and have been able to watch most of them with my kids. This one is definitely not for children. The ""Vicar"" is obsessed with her own breasts and the opposite sex. It's pretty typical of American sit-coms and not what I'm looking for in a BBC series."
4,a fun series,"The BBC seems to be able find complete villages of eccentric oddballs that blend into a lovable ensemble that can sustain a delightful series. The Vicar is a salty, sometimes bawdy, character that I think most of us would like to know. The message isn't heavy one or particularly resonant one, but you do learn to care for each and every one of them."
4,Vicar of Dibley,"It is very enjoyable to watch. It is funny,but with underlying lessons in social justice. I am glad that I purchased it.I liked the actress who plays the vicar, a good job of casting."
1,this book is beyond painful,"this book wont just make you cry it will f@#k you up for life!it is easily the saddest book i was ever forced to read in school.our teacher was in teers when she read it aloud.unless you like having youre heart ripped out and sromped upon,just skip this one."
5,It left a strange feeling in me for 29 years,"I read this short story in my English class almost 30 years ago. I am the oldest of 8 younger brothers. I'm almost 50 now and I still think of that story when I look at each and every one of them. Four of my brothers have died, I need to read this story again.For the rest of them"
5,YES,"Finally a great Lezzy rock Goddess!!!!! Drop that divine hammer Kelly, you are much more talented and way more smokin' hot than you're sister, Kim."
1,"Irony, joke novel, or simply bad?","The novel starts of with promise but then the griding of the authors personal axes starts to whine in your ear. And it gets louder and louder as the pages turn. The NASA sections are just plain unbelievable. Why must every Sci-Fci author paint them with the incompentant pen pusher brush? The scenese of modern society are not beliveable. The characters are less complicated and real than the plastic toys you find in McDonalds fun meals. Once on mars it just gets more and more stupid until you wonder at your own personal skills in picking this book up and not noticing the smell it gives out. A stinker. I thought it may be trying to be funny ala ""the stainless steel rat"" but I suspect the author just can't write."
3,Not that impressive,"I picked this up on vacation and probably wouldn't have finished it except that I didn't have many other choices. The plot ""twists"" are either obvious or don't seem to bear on the article at all. I still can't figure out why some of the key characters even went to Mars at all. Or why the ""shadowy cabal government"" wanted them there in the first place. The characters were creative if not engaging. I just didn't find myself caring about what happened to them. If you're looking for something in the ""alien artifact"" genre I'd look at Jack McDevitt first."
3,"Great book, of course, but only OK for this Kindle version","Biggest problem: chapters only show chapter numbers, no other information, which makes it difficult to navigate to a chapter about a specific topic. Thus, only three stars, although the book itself deserves 5 stars, of course, since it is a masterpiece and a must read for Latter-day Saints and others who want to get to know our Savior."
5,DVD Plays And Looks Great On A Bluray Player With HD Monitor,Contains most of my favourite titles by the Corrs. They are a highly polished act presented in a technically excellent audio video presentation.
3,The cd is good but not great...,Well some of the songs are pretty catchy when u first hear it but then they all sound the same... They've got some good female vocals that i liked in their songs Comin' Back and Jaded which were pretty phat...Theyve got some great beats but a lil too commercialized... Check them out in concert ill tell u that and they own everything
1,lame,"crystal method are a joke. missing the point of electronic music completely and creating repetitive unoriginal tracks. no wonder they became so popular, just another reason nobody respects electronic music. people keep making acts like this famous."
4,A Very good CD and I recommend buying it right away!,"I am very picky when it comes to techno music and Rave music, but I found that this CD has many many great Techno songs which are hard to find these days. The bass sound is great, and the beat will take you to a totally new level. Definitely a good buy if your a Techno lover!"
5,One of the best ever,"This is one of the best techno albums of any techno genre. It's clean, precise, and basically flawless. Very funky. See them live if you get a chance, very intense."
1,Crystal Method Scores a Zero,"I've been listening to techno and all it's other little byproducts and whatnot for a few years now. The first cd I picked up from the genre was the Crystal Method's Vegas, and I liked it, so I bought more techno, and I liked that. And more, and more... my collection now consists of names like Photek, Wagon Christ, the Chemicals, the FSOL, Orbital, and many more, and looking back, though the Crystal Method may be a decent stepping stone from pop to techno, it basically sucks compared to my other stuff. A bit of advice: pick up Orbital's Brown Album (Orbital 2), Orbital's Snivilization, any Aphex Twin, Reprazent's Newforms (a _lovely_ 2 disk set), any DJ Shadow... the list goes on, but don't get Vegas. It'll just sit on your shelf after you get into some of the better stuff out there."
3,Not golden but still a guilty pleasure,"Should you buy this disk? Yes. And here is why:It's not the best electronic cd in the world. It's not even the best on their label. But it does have infectious beats and some stunning production. There are a lot of people either way too pro/con this record. The house purists think it's the devil and the newbies/ad execs think it rocks. Is there better electronic/house out their? By god yes! And most of it will never be heard. At least this stuff is getting a listen and it's not half bad. CM is a guilty pleasure; chocolate ice cream or Giligan's Island. Don't think about it too much just put it on and go.You will be rewarded by finding CM's influences and searching deeper for better stuff (orbital, aphex twin, the orb, g-spot, simply jeff, ruby satellite system, moby etc.).But, ""Vegas"" is good for a few spins in it's own right. Tracks 1 & 10 are key.They are really a live act anyway. STROBIC LOVE"
2,Repetitive - not in a good way,"I bought the ""Keep Hope Alive"" single on a whim, was very impressed, so I went out and found the album ""Vegas."" After I had listened to it, I was amazed at how more boring it was than the mixes on the ""KHA"" single. There's just nothing that really seperates each song from each other. They have strong beats, weird samples... but nothing particularly different, unique, or interesting. Also, the songs are generally about twice as long as they need to be.If you can still find it, buy the KHA single instead of the album. ""Vegas"" is really just sonic wallpaper."
5,The Crystal Method knows how to make music,"Techno has acquired a stereotype of repetition and lack of creativity.This assumption ususally comes from those who hear the radio and/or MTV version of most of the songs and the artists. This is their problem and their loss alike. ""The Crystal Method: Vegas"" is one of the best CD's relaesed by any artist, of any kind of music in a long time. usually you get 2, maybe 3 songs worth listening to on a CD.I like every song from track (1) ""Trip Like I Do to (10) ""Bad Stone"". It's good, addictive music. You can listen to it, no matter what mood you're in. Busy Child is the only song I no longer listen to anymore. MTV's exploitation on the original ""AMP"" and the use of it in a GAP commercial ruined it for me. It's still a good song regardless. If you don't like techno, but you haven't heard much, this is the CD to listen to if you want to give it a chance. I recommend it to everyone."
1,Be prepared! No music!,"It was really not clear when purchasing this CD that it is only spoken word. I was at least able to determine this by reading the cover before taking off the plastic. How disappointing, especially for someone relatively new to Coldplay's music."
5,Its about time,This cd is a must get! out of all of my 300+ cd's that I own this one is constantly playing on my sterio. Its about time an artist has come up with something new for the sole and mind. If you like sitting arround campfires with friends and singing then don't leave home without this cd.trust me. You'll love it
1,"Fist of dough, Lost on this show","Words can not express how bad this movie is. A combination of scenes patched together into a 90 minute disaster of film making. The movies only link to Bruce Lee is the title. Save your money or buy a ham and cheese sandwich, you will enjoy a sandwich longer than you will enjoy this film."
5,The Empire 5 Star 500 - #87,Is the monster dead? The answer is: definitely not. In the Bride of Frankenstein the nightmare continues. This chapter opens up with The Monster crawling from the smouldering ashes angrier and more blood thirsty then ever.Dr. Frankenstein soon meets another mad scientist named Dr. Pretorius who is also very interested in the macabre graveyard creation of life. Together they shall work together to create a new monster. This time the creation is a woman that is intended to be a companion for The Monster. When the new female monster is created chaos and destruction ensues. A classic horror film sequel that is arguably better then the original. The Bride of Frankenstein builds on the legend and myth of the Frankenstein monster.She's alive! Alive!
4,Very Good,"The cinematography is excellent, especially considering the limited technology at the time. The lighting effects and combined with backgrounds create an unsettling mood for many scenes. One of my favorite shots was Frankenstein viewing his reflection in a pond, and becoming terrified. Camera angles combined with a directional light create a haunted look to many of the actors as the shadows become exaggerated on their faces.The sounds were also an integral element to the mood of each scene. There was often thunder and lightning. The victim screams were shrill. Frankenstein's screams were deeper - like a painful groan. Both screams enhanced the terror in the scenes.The plot moved swiftly and kept you on the edge of your seat. I recommend the Bride of Frankenstein."
4,Another Savannahian's opinion,"I'm so glad that I chose to read this book before reading any of the book reviews that discussed its literary prose value. I fully admit to have lived in Savannah for the past ten years and probably read it for curiosity value moreso than desire to read another historical fiction. However, I had great difficulty putting this book down to work or sleep. I found the characters and plot most riveting. I found myself asking friends and co-workers that are native to Savannah about the events and descriptions of the town in earlier days, only to determine the extreme accuracy of depictions. I, too, will be awaiting the sequel eagerly."
5,Savannah Charm and Intrigue,"Fabulous first novel, filled with charm, intrigue, surprise. Painted with an artist's touch. I love Savannah and I loved this book.Bravo Dr. Harris. Please give us more."
3,Fairly entertaining quick read,"Being from Savannah I found this book fairly entertaining. I am not sure, though, how much I would have liked it if I didn't live here. Great art the book isn't. Characters in the book lack complexity. They seem almost cartoonish in how they are either completely good or completely bad. However, it does read very smoothly and tells a decent story. It is predictable in that the good guys win in the end, but I guess that happens in most stories. On another note, the book goes to great lengths to extol the virtues of a certain high school. Being that the school I went to stood in direct opposition to it, I can't say that I agree with the author's portrayal."
1,"Interesting material, horrid writing.","There is rich material in this chronicle of life in Savannah. However, this novel is crippled by its cliches. Worse still, the writing is tasteless and adolescent, and because of this scenes that strive for drama are sadly laughable. I believe I said in my earlier review that this is some of the worst prose I'd ever seen between hard covers. Any reasonably intelligent high school student should have developed a better prose style. That this book could have found an audience at all is a sad comment on American culture."
2,B....O....R....I....N....G,"Just because you enjoyed Ryan Adams' solo albums doesn't mean you will enjoy this one. He is much more entertaining on his own. The songs are ok, but they aren't as good as his solo work. You will want to listen to it before you buy it."
4,Ranks with the best alt-country,"I'm very biased toward the alt-country movement/sound and this is one of the best efforts of the genre. The vocals, in fact, are better than you'll find on just about anything out there. Whiskeytown lives in the shadows a little bit of both Son Volt and Wilco, and it may not be justified.This record gets better with repeated listens. The songs grow in complexity and the layering effect on the final 4 songs in particluar is tremendous.Faithless Street is next on my list, and I look forward to Whiskeytown's next new release."
4,Music to listen to over and over.,"Liked ""Sixteen Days"" so much! Will probably get around to listening to the rest of the disk soon. Best band to come out of the region since Tom Petty. I read he was around when they recorded ""Strangers Almanac"". You guys were in good company. I would like to hear more. Thanks for what you've given so far."
4,Acid meets Smooth,"Very cool, acid-y jazz, although it doen't fall into the ""smooth"" (i.e more contemporary, which has become a bit sterile) jazz category because it has more kick with it's keyboard and sax punctuations.The opening track, 'Eastside', is the best piece, setting the tone with a clever mix of funk, acid and modern. Definately work the wait if you order the import.Also, I was pleased with their new follow-up, Nocturnal."
2,ok but pricey,I shpuld have shopped around more I found them cheaper locally after I had ordered...price of convience I guess....
1,NilCommunication,"I have ordered many items with Amazon over the years and this is by far the WORST experience I have had. I was told that the item was being prepared for shipments and would ship June 30th thru July 2nd. It is now July 6th and I have not received an update. I also contacted Amazon customer service and have not received an update from them either. I do alot of online ordering and will try to order via Amazon whenever possible, I'm going to rethink that now as I recommend you do also."
3,Fair game...,"I'd hoped for a good fleet combat simulator, and this one isn't bad...but it feels a bit unfinished. If you read the history of the game on Wikipedia, you'll see why. It's also a bit confusing, because it seems to be translated into English - with those weird sorts of language constructions. Well worth the money and enjoyable... but not a life-changing event."
2,have to be a scientist to understand it all,Way to complicated. It might work for someone that knows about chemistry and science. I went to school to be a preschool teacher. Way out of my league. It lost me. Might help someone out there though.
1,Is this lady for real?,"People will believe anything. This book is full of proposperous claims, and scientifically impossible devices. The idea of a 9V battery ""zapping"" parasited deep in body tissues is most ridiculase. Last time I checked, the skin was quite an insulator. The book has no hard facts to back up all the claims. Where are the many people that are cured from these cancers and even HIV/AIDS. There are none, because the only diaganosis cured were tested by some hocus pocus in the quacks private practice. No medically diagonosed cases have ever been cured by this money grubbing con aritist. The book tries to generate fear about being contaminated by everyday living. The cure, send money for off the wall products and supplements with no quality control packing. If you would by the brooklin bridge, this book is for you."
2,The suggestions were a bit complicated.,I purchased all three of the books in this series.There was some useful information regarding supplementsand lifestyle changes.There was also a lot of complicated technical instructionsthat I couldn't do. Most people won't.
1,"Very bad, grating prose; interesting subject matter","Just a heads up: though David Quammen has won awards for his prose, it's grating and full of segways. Just a sample, picked randomly from one of his nature essays (Time and Motion Study): ""We've all heard the canard (masquerading as scientific fact that someone remembered someone else having read somewhere, always untraceable and unconfirmed) that the flight of a bumblebee is aerodynamically inexplicable"". It's like this throughout. Quammen comes across as a pretentious, book-learned auto mechanic.If you can stomach the prose then the articles are interesting for the few factual titbits. But Quammen is a difficult read because of the ackward prose.A better writer for non-fiction is John McPhee. A better writer, period, is Ernst Hemingway."
3,A Gr8 Film,"You can say what you like about this film, but you have to admit it is fun. I had been trying buy it for years and was pleased to see its release on DVD. On the DVD its self there isn't much, the picture quality is okay, but who knows where they got the footage from. It fades to black from time to time like its taken from a TV version with the Ad's cut out. And it still has the 'cigarette burns' in the corner ever real for the Projectionist. All i can say is, can we have Trancers II now?"
3,buy the album instead,"Well, like the person above says, this music is killer, but 3 of the songs are on the album, one is a pretty good remix, one a radio edit. Just buy the full-length ""Vegas"" album instead, since it is amazingly good..."
5,Measure your tailpipe before you buy,"It worked as promised on my mole issue. I have soft ground in my flower beds due to thick mulch and was unable to use traps successfully. This worked great. However, the inside diameter of the device is 3 inches so your tailpipe cannot be more than 3 inches outside diameter. It can be smaller, but no larger. I could not use it with my pickup but it worked on my minivan. The directions for use were clear and concise."
3,"pretty good overall, bit of a slower pace for Iles","Following the grand success of Spandau Phoenix, Iles tells another tale with World War II roots in Black Cross. This time the story is completely within the wartime context, except for the frame of a doctor discovering the unknown but heroic exploits of his grandfather. That grandfather begins World War II as a pacifist researcher in Oxford, England, looking for counters to poison gas, but he comes out of the war something entirely different. A plan by British intelligence to end the threat of Hitler's poison gas program, the same Israeli operative from Spandau Phoenix, and the characters of a unique Nazi concentration camp join in changing that grandfather forever. With fewer characters than Spandau Phoenix, Iles develops these a bit more but does less with the overall plot. I thought this one moved considerably slower for no good reason. Black Cross is not as good as Spandau Phoenix, but it is still a solid read."
1,Still Waiting,"I ordered this item over two week ago and am still waiting. Woodworkers Hardware called and the said it was back ordered for one week. No additional communication and have still not arrived. Furthermore, they already charged the credit card."
5,"answer to J. C. Urbaniak ""jcurbaniak","This is an answer to the rants of Mr J. C. Urbaniak ""jcurbaniak , who apparently has been living under a rockh and has never heard about the Masterpiece novel: The Martian Chronicles by Ray Bradbury, one of the best Sci-Fi writers ever, he, Bradbury wrote a collection of short stories and put them together for publication, this is his Mars, not the real one, a Mars where there is a thin breathable atmosphere, martians, canals and life, yes life, because in the end, We are the martians. As always happens, the movie adaptation does not live up to the expectations risen up by the novel, a novel that moves you to tears, like in the chapter The third expedition, you'll need to have kleenex at hand when reading the poem ""There will come soft rains"", and you'll feel revitalize when finishing the last paragraph. Go, buy the novel, then return and buy this DVD set as a companion multimedia material."
5,Great Adaptation of a Great Book,"This sprawling miniseries was excellent. I saw it on SciFi channel and taped it, and have watched it again and again. The acting is great, the stories wonderful. Since it was made in the 70s, some people have cited that the special effects suck. Honestly, its like a fly on a mile wide windshield. The effects are obscured by the amazing stories and timeless imagination of Ray Bradbury. My only problem was that the end dragged itself out a bit, but in the end, it didnt matter. I would recommend this movie to all Science Fiction fans because it is a masterpiece of all trades."
5,"Cerebral, thoughtful fantasy/sci-fi","Not all of it was good but there was some really good stuff in this TV movie. I appreciated that the characters were thoughtful, sensitive people rather than Hans Solo type buckaroos. I wish there was more fantasy/sci-fi like this.""Watch life. Observer nature and cooperate with it. Life is it's own answer. Live well. Enjoy the gift of pure being.""Be forgiving about the primitive special effects. It was a TV movie. They were working on a shoe string budget."
3,Long ago in a galaxy far away...,"Having seen this in the early 80's and searching constantly, I must say the old memory does play tricks on how good something was.I love old movies and TV shows but some how I was left a little disappointed by the outcome of seeing this again. Nostalgia can only carry you so far and I obviously was in another time and place when I saw it the first time.There are some yawning gaps between scenes which never seem to be answered, and some what the hell was that about scenes.Overall three stars for trying and having a little vision - even if it isn't 20/20."
2,Not great,"A potentially-great miniseries, and one which is quite nostalgic for people in their late-20s, but it's not actually all that good. Essentially, the book is a masterpiece, but it's a collection of short stories - the television series might have worked as a 'Twilight Zone' anthology, but by concentrating on just three stories, stretched out to 45 minutes each (by Richard Matheson of 'I am Legend' fame), it becomes lengthy and dull. The acting is solid, but then again the actors don't have much to do. And the low budget is painfully obvious - whilst the martians are interestingly designed, the whole thing is too close to 'Doctor Who' for comfort.Is this review - 'YOU KNOW THE TWISTS AND TURNS' - actually of the series, or is it just copied and pasted from something else?"
2,Read the Book Instead,"I read almost everything written by Ray Bradbury before I ever saw this...I wish I hadn't. My imagination and Bradbury's excellent descriptive style clashed entirely with this B-film version of his story!!! I made the mistake of sitting down with my children to watch this, telling them that they were in for a treat. I didn't argue with them when they begged to be released from the torture of watching more than 45 minutes of this. I gave the film away."
5,Beautiful Harmonies.,"I just bought this CD under a different cover at the dollar tree. The songs are melodic and peaceful. Unlike many Celtic cds, bagpipes don't make an appearance. I liked the feel of this- lots of harps, guitar, and flutes. The new cover is called Celtic Inspirations- if you look for it at the dollar tree, it is the same exact cd. I was astonished as to how wonderful it was, I would have easily payed more for it."
3,Good for what it was needed for but be forewarned,My only complaint for this product is that it was coated with some type of film. My welder hit the ends with grinding wheel quickly and it welded horribly. After really cleaning the ends up the product welded just fine. You should let people know if this is coated material. Mcmastercarr does not coat it's steal unless it tells you it does!!!
5,Actually works,"I used one of these on a baby goat that had broken its leg.Splinted it to get it to the vet. Vet X-rayed the leg and said the break was simple enough - just leave this splint on and change bandage as needed.So, it also was good enough to use as a cast - in this instance. I would not recommend it without medical approval. Just mentioned to demonstrate the quality of the product."
2,"Ok, but not a great value","There are only 3 plastic sheets that come in this package. When I cut it to fit my camera's 2.5"" screen, I can see that I'll only be able to get 3 screen protectors per sheet. Also, the two of the edges are slightly wrinkly, so the edge didn't lay completely flat. I guess you can remedy this by cutting all 4 sides of your screen protector, instead of taking the shortcut by using an existing side. But unlike others, I do like the squeegee it came with because it is wrapped in a felt cloth so it didn't scratch when I used it. Maybe they've made an improvement in the product recently? It's a bit expensive because the shipping is $7.95 - more than twice what you pay for the product itself. In the end, it does what I need it to do."
1,WARNING-incorrect description,"This item clearly states that it includes a roller fairlead, and the picture also shows it, however it does not. Amazon's answer is to contact the manufacturer who says it does not include it. Buyers beware!"
2,whats with the short version,There was a 190 minute directors cut version of this film made. Why is the disasterously shortened 137 minute version being offered on DVD?
2,Extremely Abridged Version of Dune,"Unfortunately, this DVD has been edited beyond belief. Many scenes have been cut out. I verified this by watching the full version on TV! I was extremely dissapointed."
2,Good Movie...Bad Transfer.,"Still enjoyed the movie after all these years. But the transfer to DVD was poor. Color saturation and sound were both lacking. I found only marginal inprovement from VHS. Even ""Walkabout"" had a better transfer. We really need a technical review section."
4,A grain of Sand,"The movie was done quite well,that is if you had NOT read the Dune series of books.If you had then you might had been disappointed.It was an honest attempt at seeing into the Mind of the author Frank Herbert.This movie barely skims the surface on the pond of imagination that was called Frank Herbert.I recommend going back and reading the series of books in the Dune Trilogy and then watching the movie again.You will understand how this movie to some Herbert readers was a farce. I would buy it again,after my curreent copy becomes un playable and worn out. long live the FIGHTERS!"
3,Why no director's cut?,"If you have ever caught _Dune_ on the Sci-Fi channel, you know that there is a mighty long version dubbed as a directors cut making it's way around. The directors version contains some scenes left on the cutting room floor that help make sense of the movie. I was hoping, against hope of course, that the DVD would include the directors cut, or at least some of the deleted scenes as a feature. Alas that was not the case. ALl we really get is the movie, in its originally flawed version. Of course it is still an above average movie, and the movie itself would normally garner four stars out of five from me, but the lack of more interesting features forces me to drop it a notch as the DVD version."
2,Hard to review,"Fans of the book will not really like it, it doesn't even come close to holding it's own against the book, the movies a absolute mess compared to the book. So dune fans will find this film very very disapointing. And people who know nothing about dune whoa are just watching the film will find themselves asking ""what the? "" every minute of the movie. Alien had much better effects and that was made five years earlier, the shields look horrible, the ships look horrible, the combat looks horrible, and the acting and voices are laughable, I couldn't give it one star though cause I'm a big fan of the book"
1,Don't buy this boring version of a great movie.,There is a reason the extended scenes hit the cutting room floor in the first place. Childlike dialogue dumbs down a very intelligent film. I can't believe the opening sequence of storyboard drawings were ever intended for audiences to see as part of the film. Did David Lynch have anything to do with this release? Added scenes change the whole feel of the movie. Don't waste your money.
1,Pathetic,"This movie was terrible as a movie alone, not to mention that it did not follow the book. After watching this movie, I cannot believe that anyone can make a movie using at most a quarter of the actual book! Many of the scenes were not even in the book and several were manipulated for one reason or another so that the content and/or settings were totally different! I also have to agree with all of the other complaints from other posts regarding this movie.If looking for a Dune movie, go with the 2000 miniseries, although not perfect, it is far greater than this junk."
2,Dune-,For dummies like me it should be spelled out in PLAIN English -not tech terms about non-US format & takes a special DVD player to play it in USA. Wasted $ on my part.
4,Great classic--Two Views,I enjoy this version the best because not only do you get the version to fit a TV but you also get a widescreen so that you can choose depending on the group that is watching it.
1,Horrible.,"Big-budget sci-fi epic about the rise of a messiah on a desert planet is the exact opposite of its miniseries remake: Dull, cheesy, badly acted (with the exceptions of Patrick Stewart and Sting), and simply unpleasant to look at. It's also an incomprehensible mess with a lot of insulting interior monologue (""Arrakis...Dune...desert planet"" is a phrase repeated no less than three times in the first ten minutes, as if though we couldn't get it the first time!). Certainly, this will hold much appeal to hardcore David Lynch fans but everybody else will probably be smarter and stay away. Special note to the final battle scene, which features not a single loss on the Fremen side!"
3,Half of a good movie,"I am of mixed minds on Dune, because I think the movie itself feels like two different movies. The first half is a marvelous set-up. It's filled with incredible details and wonderful visuals. It takes its time to effectively set the stage for what is to follow.On the other hand, the second half of the film is rushed. Things happen too quickly, without enough detail. And the hack of using technlogy rather than fighting style to train the Fremen is nonsense. (And I won't even go into the very silly final minute of the film.)I still enjoy the film because there is so much that is good in it. But at the same time, I'm dissapointed that the second half didn't live up to the promise of the first."
3,Poor Quality,"There are tons of shortcomings to this release. The most obvious being the video quality.. the right side of the screen has a light blue tint in most scenes, and the left side (25% of the screen) has a dingy green hue.The audio quality is poor in certain scenes, such as the scene in Castle Caladan between Lady Jessica and Rev Mohaim discussing the need to test Paul. Terrible sound quality.At least it is on a DVD.. so it will not corrupt as rapidly as my VHS version, but seriously, except for the widescreen formatting, the VHS version is better in every respect, even with the age of the tape approaching 25 yrs old this year."
2,"Yikes! Finished reading Dune, then watched this . . .","I can't imagine how anyone who hasn't read the book could possibly even make the slightest sense out of this movie. And it's one of the worst book-to-movie translations I've ever seen. They couldn't even get the costumes right, much less the characters and story. Let's all hope next year's six-hour TV rendition is vastly better than this mess of a movie."
5,This movie is better than Five Stars!!,"I saw this movie as soon as I could get it from the video store, and I had to tell them to order it for me back in the eighties!! This is the ONLY movie I have seen more than five times, and I've seen it at least 20 times! This is absolutely the best sci-fi movie I have ever had the priviledge to watch, and I've seen them all!!! From the very beginning leave your definitions of concepts tucked somewhere under a distant grey matter fold in your brain, and watch and absorb the completely new ones beamed at you in the movie!! The concept of folding space to travel from one end to the other via mental projection is a believable answer around light speed-time-space limitations posed by Einstein and Hawkins, et al, and one that intrigues my imagination!! Many kudos to the participants that made this film epic! And the voice modulation-amplification weapons idea is stupendous!! It definitely works for me!!!"
3,DUNE,"Well, The original *UNCUT* movie is worth 5 stars. I was very dissapointed to find a few important scense cut from this DVD. Surly they could easly included them.On a positive side, the wide screen format was super."
2,"Read the book, don't watch the movie","This movie did have some redeaming factors, but it isn't really worth the effort of sitting through it. I've heard that you either love this movie, or you hate it, and I think I may be one of the latter. If you really want an enjoyable experiance, read Frank Herbert's book, which is definately more worthwhile than this!"
3,"A good attempt, much like cramming a V8 into a Ford Escort!","Read the book instead. The movie is full of great special effects and memorable characters, but it's greatest fault is that it was as if Cliff Notes had produced it!"
3,"Good,but no cigar!","This movie could have been soo much more if they hadn't have chopped it up to make it shorter!Some decent effects,and good performances from both Kyle Machlachlan and Patrick Stewart.However,the film (because it was cut soo much)is a little confusing at times,and to reduce the confusion they hired a guy with a boring voice to read some even more boring voice overs to try and let on the bulk of the film isnt lying on the cutting room floor!If you want a mediocre action movie,this is for you,decent effects,acting and an excellent score.However if you want to watch something faithful to the book,buy the Sci-fi channel 2001 version instead!"
5,Muad'dib!,"What can I say? I love Frank Herbert and the first couple of books in the Dune series. I also love David Lynch. How could combining the two possibly go wrong? I loved this movie when it first came out and I love it still -- both the extended version and the theatrical release. The costumes are great -- still. The effects are dated, but that's what happens as life marches forward. I did not appreciate Kyle MacLachlan when I was a kid, but I adore him now. The movie could use a little more Duncan Idaho, but what can you do?"
5,movie,This was a entertaining movie. I have suggested it to all of my friends. It is a great and fantastic movie.
3,missing scenes,I was disappointed in the fact that several scenes were absent from the DVD including the gom jibbar sequence early in the movie. Some of the deleted scenes contained important plot points. If the viewer has not seen the intact version of this movie he/she will be lost.
2,What exactly was the point of this release?,"OK...So. We finally get an region 1 release of the ""extended"" version of the film. Along with the theatrical release. That's why I gave it 2 stars, and that's also where the good review ends.Where the hell are the special features? There's enough information about the Dune story to fill a Lord of the Rings style 4 disc box set. Yet here all we get is a handful of nonsense. The special features seem more like highlights from a longer set of features. For christ sake the longest one clocks in at a whopping 7 mins, and change, in length. My copy of Half Baked has better, and more in depth, special features.I felt incredibly cheated after having watched this dvd. If you've never seen the extended version of Dune, pick it up just for that. Otherwise give it a pass, or buy it used.PS.Why couldn't they do DTS audio for at least the theatrical version? Even Dawn Of The Dead got DTS for it's re-release."
2,Don't bother,Unless you are a fanatic of the book don't even bother with this one.Although the movie is packed with impressive visual effects the story line is hard to take and confusing.
2,Boring,"I only downloaded this for my husband. He liked it, but I thought it was extra boring. I couldn't follow it, and I totally hated the flying man with boils on his face."
3,2 1/2 doesn't = 4 hr.,"I've read the whole book series, and seen all three versions of the movie and this 2 1/2 hr leaves some important facts out about charecters and the plot. Overall it was alright but it does not come close to the 4 hr."
1,Dissapointing release,"This is the Alan Smithee version, extended edition, that has been available over the Internet for years, poorly edited, with repeated scenes, like the same Harkonnen landing shuttles scene use several times along the movie, in other inserted scenes the Fremen do not have their Ibad (blue eyes); another nagging example: the movie jumps from wide-screen scenes to full screen ones! No wonder David Lynch disavows this version."
4,It does take someone capable of imagination....,"Dune is a visually impressive movie. Although you may need to see it several times to catch all the dialog due to the director needing to compress it into a certain amount of time. It is a movie that envelopes political intrigue, romance and adventure. It definely requires imagination, which I am sure many critics don't have! If you like Science fiction, you should enjoy this movie."
4,Impressive transfer for this 22 years old cult sci fi,"Whether you adore or totally disdain Dune( that's the kind of film ), the original movie from David Lynch, the hi def 1080p transfer really shines. The Universal compressor(s) that did the job really made it to be one of the very few pristine movies from the 80s comparable to video quality of newer releases being 5-10 years old. Interior shots are incredibly rich, detailed ( even revealing source focus and limitations, yet very occasionally ). However, some black spots, exteriors at night and special effects still show some grain and noise - but how to expect better from analog effects made then ?Sounds are OK, sometimes amplified through good bass effects ( like the thumper scenes ). Extras are on standard def, as for any catalog movie.Dune HD DVD will most probably be the ultimate home version for the years to come. Highest recommendation possible, for fans of the film."
2,Nothing like the book,"In 2004, I finally read Dune. Awesome story and I plan to read it again someday. Movies often fail to meet up to the book they are based upon and this is no exception, in my opinion. Maybe I am mesmerized by all the amazing special effects in movies these days, but I actually laughed much through this movie. I realize the story is complicated and long, but the 1984 version just doesn't cut it. I would LOVE to see a remake of this, not so much for updated special effects (the worms were great in the 1984 version) but for a more engaging storyline. Like LOTR, one is going to appreciate the movie much more if they've read the book, but LOTR followed the books quite well, IMO, AND they came out with movies that awed even non-book-readers. I think DUNE could be like that."
5,One Of My Favorite Sci-Fi Pictures.,"I would like to be an exception to SharpX13 ""Jeremy""'s comment that those who read the book loved it and those who didn't hate it. I've never read any of the Dune books, and I also haven't seen any other David Lynch movie besides this one (though I did watch some of Twin Peaks). Yet, I enjoyed this picture immensely.For those who haven't seen this picture, it has excellent special effects. If the job of a movie is to take you to a world you've never been, this would qualify for exhibit A. It is too graphic and intense for the younger crowd, with a PG-13 rating. It is long, but not boring. This movie made a very strong impression on me."
1,Dune Bad,This is one very poorly made movie. Look at the actors they got and this is all that they did. McLachlan is horrible like usual. Read the book and don't bother with this.
1,GARBAGE!!!!!,"DO NOT, I REPEAT DO NOT, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES WAIST YOUR MONEY ON THIS MOVIE!!!!!! GET JOHN HARRISON'S WONDEROUS ADAPTATION!!!!!! IF YOU ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO SEE THIS TRASH, WAIT FOR IT TO COME ON THE SCIFI CHANNEL!!!!!! AND WORSE YET THEY HAD PATRICK STEWART ON THE CAST, THE ONLY ACTOR IN HOLLYWOOD WHO WOULD BE ABLE TO CORRECTLY PORTRAY DUKE LETO ATREIDES, AND INSTEAD HAD THE MAN, WHO SCREAMS OF LEADERSHIP QUALITIES, PLAY GURNEY HALLECK, WHO IS BASICALLY A GLORIFIED THUG!!!!!!!!"
3,Pretty good except...,"This is a pretty good movie, aside from the fact that it has very little to do with the actual novel. The idea of a an auditory weapon to be used by an army, while creative, is nowhere to be found in the novel. There are many inconsistencies if you compare the two. However, if you look at the movie on its own as its own entity, it is quite good. I recomend it to anyone that isn't picky about movies sticking to the book or people that haven't read Dune."
3,Read the book,"Sometimes you need at least 20 hours of movie to tell a half of what is writen in a book. The same with Dune. And its 1984, so don't expect believable special effects. BTW, if you didn't like the DVD - read the book. If You think it is 5 star movie - read the book. If you are not sure you want to watch it - read the book."
3,Very Good for working man and manager,I interest about the smart way to work. This book advise me that how I can working smart. After I read it. I think it easy to implement. I appreciated.
1,Too many rings in a pack,"The idea that the average consumer is going to want ten of these is rather unlikely, I certainly don't and don't appreciate buying ten times more than I need just to get one of them."
5,I love these bottles! Yes MAM!!!!,"After the scare of Bisphenol A (BPA) and polycarbonate in the plastics of the clear, hard plastic baby bottles, I panicked to search for a bottle with an orthodontic nipple like the Nuk bottles I was using (after trying 6 different brands to find one my baby could use without leaking from the corners of her mouth!). These BPA-free bottles are safe to use with warm liquids (no chemicals leaching from the bottle), and they are easy to clean with the screw-off bottoms. The orthodontic nipples are great, and my 6-month old has taken to them like they were made for her!! Find out what plastic YOUR baby's bottle is made of. These are the perfect replacement!!"
4,Vintage Crosby,"At the height of his wartime fame, Bing Crosby plays a hip young Catholic priest who arrives to help a troubled parish struggle back to its feet. Of course, what passed for young and hip back then, in this lily white, family-friendly comedy-drama may seem pretty silly these days -- Bing is convincing, though, as he use his suave social skills to listen to and help out those in need. Veteran scene-stealer Barry Fitzgerald plays the doddering, crusty old Irish priest who runs the church before Crosby's arrival... The rest of the supporting cast isn't as strong, but the film still has its charms. Mostly it's just a great chance to observe Crosby at his most magnetic and self-assured. The film also previewed hits like ""Swinging On A Star"" and Bing's version of ""Too-Ra-Loo-Ra-Loo-Ra,"" both of which are longtime favorites."
5,Excellent,This is probably my most favorite movie. I had a VHS copy but wanted a DVD and only could find it at Amazon. I highly recommend this movie
5,One of my favorite films,Warms the heart and soul. A simple message of faith and hope and something we can use in today's society.
3,glue pricing,found it cheaper @ Menards .& can have it right away . whats up with that ? gotta watch pricing a littel closer
2,No Longer Relevant,"This book looked great -- and maybe a few years ago it was a great resource. But Linux has moved with leaps and bounds during the years and many Linux releases are now beyond the tekkie status of earlier releases and the typical person interested in Linux is probably leaning toward one of the major distributions such as Ubuntu or Mandriva. I purchased the book with enthusiasm (recently) and donated it to a thrift book store within a week. It is not a bad book, but just not (in my opinion) useful in today's Linux world."
4,Reality Check,"I usually am disappointed in the art books I purchase because they lack insight into the artist and the reproductions are consistently not accurate reproductions.However, one reviewer needs a reality check. Yes, Basquiat may have indeed been a drug addict and mooch to some, but characterizing the man this way only reveals the writer's utter lack of understanding of the art, the process and the mental anguish and character flaws that may have existed. Learning to see is perhaps more difficult than being judgemental.Take the eighties art scene for what it was, but don't disparage the artist for his weakness. And while I'm not endorsing excess or drug use, that weakness was integral in the production of what could be argued is some of the most important art of the age."
3,Contains just a peek into the life of Basquiat,"I enjoyed this book. It is a pretty entertaining read,but it does not got that in depth into the artists life. It does give some insight into the man and his work, but not as much as I would like. Still worth a look for any fan of Basquiat, though. 3 1/2 STARS"
3,journalism vs biography,"For those expecting a true biography, this one may disappoint. Basquiat's childhood is dispensed with in a scant 10 or so pages, and before the obvious questions are addressed, the author begins dropping names of all the people Basquiat either did drugs, had sex or lived with. The author is a journalist, and the book reads like journalism - a little sensationalist (with just the right amount of mock apology to keep it legit) and fast and loose with the historical record. There is precious little attention given to the cultural background of the late seventies and eighties that led to the appearance of artists like Basquiat and Haring and Scharf. Ms. Hoban does lay bare, almost unwittingly, the pathos of Basquiat's mind, but I kept wanting to know more of where that pathos came from. She did not dig deep enough,something a good historian would have surely done."
3,Lots o' anecdotes,"I have had a hard time putting down the book--it is very well researched w/ many anecdoates about the artist, and also about the 80s art world, including its various characters. A good read, in that way. I was disappointed I didn't really get a feel for who Baquiat really was--what he felt, what he thought, his philosophy toward his art, etc. It was a lot of ""he did this"" and ""he did that"", but I can't say I got a feel for who he was other than that he was tortured, *always* high, outrageous, a total glutton, and likely a brilliant artist. I would have appreciated insight into who he was--I'm still curious--though, as I said, it was interesting otherwise."
4,in flames oWN,"ok I would like to start this review off by saying that it this album is VERY different from their previous albums and that their previous albums are much better BUT that doesn't mean that this isn't an absolutely incredible album..yes this is a much softer in flames but iit is still great. don't get this if you are just getting into in flames, get colony first."
4,Pretty good...,"Although i have never heard In Flame's older stuff, i picked this up while at the record store with a friend of mine. You can definitely hear why this CD ... off many In Flames' fans, because it wreaks with a nu-metal approach to it, although they pull it off extremely well, as if they weren't going for the nu-metal approach but were trying to start it, unaware it's already been around. One thing i disliked was they arranged the songs on this CD like a typical nu-metal band would, the first few songs are the best then your interest while listening declines after those songs. That and the songs seem to follow a ""formula,"" or each song seems to have been arranged the same way, which bores me. Despite it's shortcomings, it's worth a listen, but this isn't one of those ""BUY IT NOW!!!!!"" CD's, check it out first to see if you like it then buy it."
1,O STARS WAS MADE FOR CD'S LIKE THIS,"terrible CD,go back to your roots guys your losing the real fans that put you on the map in the first place."
3,A useful but basic resource,"Basic information. clearly worded. A bit dry, but no more so than most technical manuals. The authors are obviously knowledgable in this specialty. Recomended for begining practitioners and those without a CD background."
5,incredible and unbelievable,"There is no need for me to exult to this movie, it is deservingly world famous. I do agree with one of the reviewes here that Mann's novella makes a different impression, although I would still hesitate to say that it's a swallower work of art. What I wanted to share is the feeling of before and after - if you see Venice first and then see the movie, and then come back to the city again, you will see it differenty. I do think that it's one of the most profoundly influential movies, and for everyone who liked it and appreciated the music there, Ludwig by Visconti is a must, too. Just to conclude, I did find it puzzling to find Death in Venice in the gay section in a video store; I think the movie is about the appreciation of beauty that goes beyond society-imposed limits and the individual's fright and astonishment when the power of beauty hits him. Enjoy this masterpiece!"
3,Edited version of Visconti's Death in Venice,I first saw this Visconti version of Death in Venice about thirty years ago on tv. Although this version is good they edited the dream scene of the composer to a much shorter less dreamier version. The scene I remember was longer and had the sound and video of a breeze.
2,The book is better,I think the film is too etherial in its approach to the subject..and avoids the real pathos....Bogarde is too young for the role...and his makeup was distracting....Alec Guiness would have been perfect...Noble but tragic..
3,If you haven't read this you know nothing of Washington,"If you read Teddy Roosevelt's History of the United States first it will make more sense. Could be better written, author alludes to information but doesn't cover it in detail. Unfortunate in that with one or two sentences you would know what he is talking about rather than having to research it in wiki or google. Worth a read even with that criticism."
4,As good a single volume on the Father as you will find,"A brisk, but not too brief account of Washington and the times surrounding him. Alden touches on most every event and aspect concerning the subject: from Shay's Rebellion to Martha's disposition, from the Hamilton-Jefferson Feud to his agricultural experiments. It is objective without trying to debunk a great man. Only the cursory discussion on slavery does the junvenile yankee condescention surface (Whose ships were involved in the slave trade even after the Virginians pushed through its ban via the Constitution? Yankees ie the Great Hypocrites of All Time.) It is, however, a thorough and interesting biography and highly recommended."
5,Later & Better,"Having always liked Clifford T.Ward,I knew I would like this album,but more than that I love it.Good Quality production & good solid songs,that,are profound & moving.To me these later songs show what CTW would have gone on to in a less cruel world.An unsung genius indeed."
1,As Unfunny as a Heart Attack and Downright Racist,"Chevy Chase has always been the laziest kind of comedian, and even at his best is mostly just a foil for cheap one liners and sight gags. Thanks to Saturdy Night Live, millions of people are used to watching for 90 dull minutes just to see perhaps 10 or 15 minutes that are at all funny. The ratio of funny to dull in this movie is even lower though. The worst part is the ""Indian Guides"" which are scathingly and shockingly racist in a way one wouldn't expect from Mr Chase the Alleged Liberal. A great deal of the movie is devoted to seeing just how much the cast and movemakers can mock and denigrate American Indian cultures. The audience I saw this with didn't laugh at any of it, they actually BOOED, and loudly too. Save your money, this awful film leaves you sick to your stomach."
2,A good child's movie- not for anyone over 12!,"I saw ""Man of the House"" because my younger cousin who I was babysitting rented it, so I thought I'd watch it. I found it to be typical mindless waste of film. My cousin who is female and 7 enjoyed the film alot more than me and found the message to accept your step father as a profound moral while i saw it as cheezy."
5,Lovely!,"I could tell this would be a great book by the first page! The story is told in rhyme, which always makes it more fun to read to my 3 year old. I love the message of the book - that nature doesn't belong to anybody, and that every little creature has a purpose. It is one of the nicest children's books I've found."
5,This is the best concert I've EVER seen,"I was amazed last night when I skimmed through the songs on this blu-ray. I watched it in its entirety this evening.Now, I've been to a LOT of concerts over the years and have also watched many, many concert DVD's and blu-rays andthis concert is the best concert I've ever seen. I've been a fan of Foreigner for years but not really a hardcore fan.Regardless, these six guys are tight with every song. I am amazed by Kelly Hanson's voice; great range and very, verysimilar to Lou Gramm's voice. Even though I think Lou Gramm had a great voice, Kelly Hanson definitely sounds as good,if not better, than in the original songs. If you like Foreigner at all you'll love this concert. If you love Foreignerthis is a must buy. Trust me, this concert is fantastic!!!"
3,Better than most mask products,Use for migraine headaches. A bit too cold at first. Definitely need a towel between your forehead and the mask.
5,Saves the day,"I get really bad migraines and have constant allergy symptoms and this thing works so well. In addition to having the pressure and the darkness that help me feel better when I have a migraine, the icepack stays cool and is soothing. I have actually fallen asleep with it on before and woken up with my migraine gone!If you suffer from allergies or sinus pressure like I do, this mask is a miracle cure and better than any ibuprofen."
2,"Doesn't Stay Cool, Falls Apart","I was really looking foward to using my gel mask, with it's happy, spongy feel. I froze it for a week until one day I needed it.It stayed cool for about twenty minutes. That was all. The fabric took on the small of my freezer.And then it fell apart. The stitching that held the outer cover onto the inner gel came unstitched. Not a great product."
4,elasto gel mask,"I use many elasto gel products at my work and find them to do quite a good job. This eye mask does not dissapoint. It gets cold and stays cold for about half an hour. The mask is very soft on the face and provides much needed relaxation for the eyes after a day of driving, reading and looking at screens. Solid product, swift shipping. Only 4 stars because I hoped it would stay cold a bit longer. But overall great eye mask."
5,Great product,Just received the elasto gel mask today. I ordered it to relieve my dry eye problem as I read hot compresses (103 degrees for 5 minutes) is recommended. I put it in the microwave for 20 seconds per side and it got nice and hot. I placed it on my eyes and it stayed hot for the 5 minutes. It suited my purpose really well. It is a littler smaller than it looks in the picture but that worked great for me. I just need coverage for my eyes. I definately recommend it.
1,Giant hole in stiching at the top?,"For now this gets a 1 star because there's a giant part on the top that isn't even stitched. If this is intended then I apologize and will change this to a better rating, but it looks odd to me. And it's not mentioned anywhere about there being a giant part that isn't stitched closed. It's kind of in the middle but more to the left a little bit. And also when the product came the velcro part of the strap was stuck to the blue gel part (the side you put on your face) and even while gently pulling it off it managed to damage it a little bit. While that's a bummer, the biggest issue for me is the stitching at the top. As far as I'm aware there's no reason to ever take it out of it's pouch so why would it be like that? I hope they didn't send me a used product..."
4,Daiya-Monde,"Picked this up while in Japan. Although I don't speak a word of Japanese, This Chick Rocks. Mixing is a bit clunky to US standards. Musical style slides from near Metal to one track which is a very strange baby bopish tune (kinda cute). Most of this CD is pretty solid Rock. The Japanese language's ""Ah, Bah, Kah, Oh"" short melodic syllables are nice to listen to. Some songs contain bits of English."
4,Diamonds,"I love Hitomi Yaida! She's just so enjoyable! A lot of her songs are on the super happy rock side of things, but who cares when she pulls them off so well? 'My Sweet Darlin' ' is definately my favourite from this album.Many songs have bits of English here and there, and all are carried out well.Romainzed track list:01) How? -- U.K. Mix --02) Everything Is in Our Mind03) B'coz I Love You04) Your Kiss05) My Sweet Darlin'06) Girl's Talk07) Moshimo no Uta08) Nee09) Osaka Janne10) I Like -- U.K. Mix --11) Nothing"
1,Techno Babble Bore,"Robb/Roberts may have romantic novel qualities, but lacks originality and persuasion in the crime sector. None of the past reviewers seems to have noticed that the book is based on the movie script for the ""Star Chamber"" (with Michael Douglas), with a few added features. The story drags along, is predictable, and lacks suspense."
4,Good Read,"Reading this series in order is not necessary, but makes it more interesting since the development of the character of Lt. Eve Dallas is part of the compelling draw of the JD Robb books. Robb spins a good mystery and is creative and unique in the plot lines. What is disappointing, however, are the love scenes. They are cookie-cutter and as someone continues to read the books, you find phrases and adjectives that are the same over and over again. Additionally, with each successive book, those scenes become nearly brutal. This is, of course, a fantasy and given that, if you find these scenes tedious, you can skip ahead because they don't add to the plot line one bit. I will suggest, however, that the romance, no matter how it is presented, does contribute to the discontent of all women in all relationships. Nevertheless, they do not diminish the character development which is nicely paced and accurately presented in light of the human condition."
5,"""...In Death"" Rules","I absolutely adore the ""...In Death"" series. I started with ""Reunion in Death"", and bought and read the rest including the two in multi-author releases before ""Purity in Death"" was released.Eve Dallas is one of the best characters ever created, and I enjoy all of her adventures. The best ones are her development of relationships with the people around her, not just Roarke, but Peabody, McNabb, Dr Mira, Feeney, Charles and the rest. Great escapism and an awesome look at a potential future.Can't wait for ""Portrait In Death"" and all the rest the J.D. Robb (aka Nora Roberts) will create!"
4,Epic,"I love this book and I would love to read it over if I could, the suspension through the book wasamazing"
3,More like 3 1\2,"I've read all of the In Death books so far and while I love them all there was just something alittle off about Purity.I think it was probably the focus on all the minor characters, which I suppose is nessecary, but even though I adore all the regulars they just can't keep my attention like Eve and Roarke!The case was great. A computer virus that trasfers to humans, really interesting. And of course there are plenty of the smart alek jokes that I love.In short, I liked Purity and I can't wait for Portriat, but the former just lacked alittle something."
3,Not her best work,"Okay, I'm disappointed in this one. I worried about the ongoing quality of the series after Roberts/Robb committed to publishing 2 books/year in this series; look at how many new Nora Roberts/J. D. Robb titles were already coming out a year. When they were released on an 8-9 month schedule it seemed possible, but this is inhuman and it shows. (Of course, the ghostwriter rumor could be true. I gave it no credence until I read the first 4 chapters of Purity..., now it sounds a little more credible.)Having said that, bad J. D. Robb is still much better than most of what gets published. I stayed up way too late to finish it. If you like the series and the characters, you'll like it, but it's not the tour-de-force that Naked in Death is."
2,Works Okay But Cheap Rubber Cord Doesn't Last Long!,"I got this when I got a Nokia 6600 years back and while the Nokia 6600 lasted very well and I really liked it and I only had to replace it when the on/off button got spoiled after 5 years I found that I had little use for the car charger as I also had a spare battery with me and so it turned out to be an impulse buy with little use for me. However, it does work okay and if you are the kind who spends hours in your car then this may be very useful should your battery dies when you need it the most. Another thing I found about this charger is the rubber/plastic covering the wire is cheap and started to turn white and then flake off after a while making it useless after that. I guess you get what you pay for and for the price advertised one shouldn't expect too much quality although the Nokia name has been tarnished a little for having itself associated with such a cheaply produced item."
1,This does NOT fit a nokia N75. I was sadly dissapointed,The description said this would fit my Nokia N75. It did not. I was very dissapointed. Buyer beware.
2,The violence of this made it difficult to view,"While I was drawn in by the story and my curiosity about this relationship, I had trouble finishing this due to the violence. Although I feel some movies are ""worth it"" (like saving private ryan) I didn't feel that way about this movie."
2,"Unfortunately, Not for the Average Business Person","This book was a disappointment in that it appears to be primarily aimed at high-level diplomats and/or very, very high level corporate people at the biggest corporations. It seemed pompous and snobbish and out of touch with real life situations outside of the diplomatic corp. I would not recommend it for the average Joe Business man who just wants to know the proper real-life etiquette in a majority of corporate environments today."
4,A good reference book on the subject,"This book covers manners for many situations at the office, and much more. It could be useful to anyone who works in an office with other people.It does not address certain topics such as internet messaging which is becoming more common in the office these days...but most of the general information presented can be applied to different situtations as the reader sees fit."
1,Book wasn't new (as advertised),"Book arrived used, in disgusting condition. It truly looked like it was pulled from the garbage. After a long back and forth from the seller she credited my card and told me I could throw it away. She changed her mind a couple of weeks later and wanted the book sent back to her. Too late, it went back home to the garbage dump. Wierd experience but I wasn't in a hurry to get the book so I just bought another one. The book itself is fantastic and I do recommend it. Maybe that seller should read it."
1,Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz,"If your a John Wayne fan, and are looking for a good action movie, avoid this one at ALL costs! On the otherhand, if your looking for a talky melodrama, then this one is for you. You can forgive Duke for being in this, as he was involved in a number of clunkers from the early 40s (""Reunion In France"", ""Lady For a Night"", etc...); and was still not a major movie star at this point in his career."
2,Streaky--not good for cleaning polished surfaces or LCD screens,"I bought these based on another review that indicated they were streakless. This is simply not the case. They are about as wet as a baby wipe and nearly as messy. In fact, they are easily the most streaky electronic wipes I've ever encountered. Even the instructions on the wipes state that cleaning with a dry cloth is necessary to avoid streaks! Anything this moist is guaranteed to leave streaks unless it also is quick evaporating and the cloth itself it sufficient to wipe out 'drying marks'. These Weiman Wipes are closer to Armor All car wipes than anything else, and while they will get your electronics clean, they don't work well at all for things like TV or Notebook screens, or the polished exterior of a phone, camcorder, or laptop. I was less than pleased with them and won't be buying them again."
2,Too Hard to Measure,I got this item to repair the many car coffee cups that I have that tend to dribble down my chin and onto my shirt and pants. The order did not work and I found the dimensions impossible to measure.
3,Doesn't always work,"The keyboard portion of this adapter only works with slower human input. The adapter will drop characters when a device, like a barcode scanner, sends key strokes too quickly. Other brands will buffer the input but not this one."
2,Lack details or examples,"Lets see, The author wants to say that the constraints on how an embryo can be grown will affect what possible phenotypes are actualised. Well that seems plausible enough, I would be interesting in finding out more about HOW to actually grow an embryo? why cant you grow a wheel and axle? But the author doesn't know, too bad. All he can do is talk about how English he is and how great is its to be English and that development must have _somthing_ to do with evolution, Oh and by they way the author is English."
5,Great Car Adapter,"Used many different adapters over the years. This one is the most durable and adaptive. The connection to the bottom of the phone STAYS (where most do not) and the connnector has not come apart where others have. After reading another review on this product, one of the stronger features of this adapter is the built in spare fuse. Sometimes car voltages spike, thus blowing the adapter fuse. This one has another built in to replace it if necessary. This adapter also charges faster than others I have used. I am pleased. I also am partial to the manufacturers own equipment. Although they are less expensive, I am very reluctant, actually will not use off brand stuff. Motorola had the best adapter in their older phones. This one now replaces it as the best."
4,Demon Seed,"This is a very cheesy horror movie...but, thats what i expected. I didn't buy this movie for the acting. I bought this because of Lana Wood ! She is HOT !!! I need not say more. Thanks.Ron Gilbert"
2,Just Okay,"As it was only $9.99 (plus shipping-and-handling), I was not expecting much, to begin with.All it is , is the 'usual' 'pan-and-scan' version, in stereo. There are no other features at all, not even a 'scene-selection'.It has not even been 'remastered'. At least, it is on 'DVD'."
5,wonderful toy for my cockatiel,fast shipping excellent service. My bird loves to chew and play with it.
5,Sweeping and uplifting,"Beautifully textured music that blends the best of Eastern and Western instruments. At once serene and energetic, Ron Korb's Japanese Mysteries have a well paced mixture of tracks, each telling a story that is infused with cultural elements. Tokaido has an especially memorable melody that one will want to listen to again and again."
3,Beautiful but impossible to install,"I love this coat hook. It has beautiful lines, great finish and just the perfect size and style for my Victorian home. We still have not installed it. We've consulted with builders, hardware stores, neighbors and friends and no one can figure out how to attach it. My husband gave up and it's in a box in the closet. The screw goes through the door (if you're putting it on a door) and the other side of the door ends up with a blunt screw poking out of it. We need the other side of the door to look as attractive as the front side. Hope there is a solution because I love the hook."
1,This episode gets a D+ grade and is ranked 68th out of 80,"The U.S.S. Enterprise is on a routine mission in deep spacewhen a beautiful young woman beamed onto the bridge. Without a word,she touches a band on her wrist and everyone is rendered unconscious..."
5,Good value for price - plus extra packing room!!,"I decided I needed a bag so we could check our our stroller when flying. We have a Maclaren Quest. Maclaren sells their own bag for a bit more money, so I decided to try this. It worked perfectly. We have used it for both domestic and international travel and it has held up well so far. The Quest fits in it with room to spare, so we are even able to throw toys and shoes in there to reduce some of the weight in our other bags - baby items like strollers and playpens don't count against you as pieces of baggage; defintely helpful in these days of airlines charging for extra bags! ;-)We haven't taken it through security with us so I can't comment on how easy or not easy it is to maneuver (we generally have our car seat with us and just roll our son through the airport in that, so we don't need the stroller until we get to our destination)."
2,Poor Reproduction,"The photo reproduced quality is so low, many paragraphs are illegible. It shouldn't be that hard to digitize, then print."
3,Not an excellent album,"Although I really appreciate Barbra Streisand and I consider her the best voice in music nowadays ,I think this album is not really much. If ,in the past , the voice of Barry Gibb produced very high quality discomusic and some lovely ballads with Barbra...In our times this sounds a bit 'odd'. Besides, I think that Streisand has sung other songs in her career ,that have enhanced 'much more' her vocal skills.The melody is also somewhat banal and repetitive. Streisand is a great artist. In this case , better when she is alone....."
5,"Barbra & Barry ""do it again""!","Really got the tingle factor with most of the songs, the dual disc was excellent, quality of sound wonderful. Thank you for a real bargain!"
4,Happy Reunion!,"After seeing all the previews on-line, there were still more than a few surprises.It compiles various styles of pop from sad and pensive to romantic and concerned ballads with a welcomed touch of disco. The variety is exciting and fluid definitely a mirror of the original Guilty; glad to see a BeeGees song included and All The Children has an unexpected introduction.Serious and playful it's worth listening to hear vocal performersenjoying sharing their songs and talent and including harmonics effects that work so well."
5,PROUD OWNER OF THIS CD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I love this cd so much! Barbra Streisand was the star of this cd. Barry was just there. Umm I love this. I first got this cd from the library to copy for my mother, then I started to like it then I decided to take hers. Then I got money and went and bought this cd, ON DUAL DISC! That's how much of a fan I am. If u don't like this cd then your are an offical dummy. Sorry. I have good taste. BARBRA FOR LIFE!!!!!!!! Oh and also I love to bug the crap out of my mother with ""Night Of My Life"", ""All The Children"", and ""Stranger In A Strange Land"", being played over and over again. Thank U."
1,Guilty Pleasures: Stoney End,"Yet another mediocre album in the ""I'm in love and lazy and fat"" period of Streisand's career. The blandness of this record is blinding; don't even ask about the videos [and that crimped hair]. The only song worth the time and trouble is ""Letting Go,"" a poignant track that reminds the listener of what BS can accomplish with a tune that actually has some substance. Unfortunately there must be no one in her camp to slap her in the butt and remind her that she is an artist first, not some yenta content to sit in a garden trimming the rose bushes while noshing on a brioche topped with diet Cool Whip.Let us hope that the lady is capable of recording one last great album before she goes off into the sunset [lit on her good side, of course]."
4,"Dis, Franny and the gang","What a fantastic group of characters he's put together in these books, and this one is just as good as the others. It was nice to see Franny's character emerge."
3,Not suitable for advertised purpose,"I purchased these covers with the intention of using them on top of my children's sheets, to prevent, as others have mentioned, having to completely strip the bed after nighttime accidents. However, these pads not only do not have a nonslip backing, they have a very slick plastic backing which makes it almost impossible for the pad to stay in one spot, making them entirely unsuitable for use on top of sheets. I have had to resort to placing the pad under the sheets, which of course requires that I strip the sheets each morning, which I was having to do anyway. I regret having purchased these, as I could have gotten pads for under-sheet use for much cheaper locally. They do help protect the mattress by being waterproof, but one can find that easily in any mattress protector."
2,Lightweight; and Retains Odor,"I purchased this item for a family member several years ago, and have not used it very much because it seems more flimsy and less comfortable than others that we own. The real problem is that it retains odors after usage, despite washing and soaking in baking soda. The only way I can get the odor out is to spray the pad with an odor-eliminator spray. We have other pads, inclulding some made by this same company, where odors wash out easily and completely with nothing more than detergent. Perhaps they have improved this since I purchased it, but based on my experience I would not recommend this item."
1,Should be a $25 shelf. Don't waste your time.,"They sent us instruction that were mis-printed so we had to look online to find proper instructions. Also it is not stable. Over the course of 6months it went from sturdy to wobbly and the back wall fell down and bottles would slip out. It's been a year now, and the shelf is basically trash. Right now I'm unscrewing everything to re-assemble it, but if my fears are correct, then the wood is so cheap that the screws can't get a firm grip and I will either have to be investing in wood-glue, or throw in the towel and hopefully find a working shelf that won't fall apart after only a few months!"
5,Classic Jimmy Stewart,"Destry Rides Again DVDDestry Rides Again is a classic Jimmy Stewart movie. Jimmy Stewart happens to be one of my favorite cowboy stars. In this movie Stewart plays a deputy who does not believe in guns.Recommended for fans of the Western Movie.Gunner December, 2007"
4,Jimmy Stewart proves he's the man (again)--very funny!,"Jimmy Stewart is probably my favorite actor, and he's just hilarious in this movie. The historical value of Marlene Dietrich is uncompelling to me, but she's a good enough actress. Unfortunately, an ending which doesn't suit my sense of thematics keeps this movie from being a 5-star effort, but it's still a quality flick--quite worth your time."
3,Very romantic,"Marlene mourant dans les bras de Jimmy, très romantique! L'histoire est invraisemblable, entre western-raté et fausse-comédie, avec un comparse qui n'arrte pas de gueuler et une virago qui veut la peau de Dietrich, tout a dans des décors de carton-pte. Distrayant."
5,Great Tool,"This is a nice supplement to the book ""Focusing"" where you learn a simple method for clearing and managing emotional states. Simple, easy to read and apply."
4,Pretty darn good,"This item is pretty good, wish it would last a little longer only because when I wear it ice-wise I have to use my floor heater at work which tends to make it not last as long but it does do the trick and it helps me. That's really what I use it for, heat-wise, it's good, but I really use it for ice, and I really should have two, one for work and one for home for when I forget, but I would recommend this product"
1,Uncomfortable to wear and not very cold,"I have two issues with this product:1) Uncomfortable - poor design has extra velcro (not used to hold the collar on you) poking out and scratching at your throat.2) Doesn't absorb the cold very well - a can of Coca Cola in the refrigerator for 20 minutes is way colder than this pack is after sitting overnight in a chest 'deep freeze' freezer.A cold wash rag wrapped around your neck and covered with a towel would be just about as effective, more comfortable, and more convenient. I suppose this would be useful to someone who is extremely sensitive to cold packs and doesn't mind red scratch marks on their neck."
4,cervical collar - heated,"Heats up nicely and covers a broader area, use it before I put on my neck traction device, help limber up neck muscles"
3,smaller than it looks,Works as advertised but only stays cold for about 20 minutes when fresh out of the freezer.The model it is pictured on must be only 5 foot tall and 90 pounds because it is nowhere near as large as the picture makes it seem.
1,Not cold enough!,"For years I've used a gel wrap made by Medi-Temp for my chronic neck pain which I love because it is ICY cold. I purchased the Elasto Gel because of the good reviews and because it looked like it would cover more of the neck and back area. I am extrememly disappointed in the Elasto Gel's temperature. Even after overnight in the freezer it feels more like a cool washrag out of the refrigerator rather than an Ice pack. If I'm not able to return it, mine will soon be available on Ebay."
1,Not worth the money,"Great seller and fast shipping, but product not useful at all. If you want cold, get an ice pack. If you want heat, get heat patches. If you want to keep re-heating a heavy awkward thing that must be sealed or even humidity will ruin it, then buy this piece of junk. The heat lasts 15 minutes at best. Useless."
1,never gets cold enough,I bought this Cervical Collar and it sucks..It never gets coid enough and what cold it does have quickly dissipates..total waste of $$$
3,Melted (within 25 seconds in micro),It worked very well for about 2 weeks. I followed the heating directions (30 seconds then 10 second increments). The shape is great if you carry stress in your shoulders that radiates up the neck. Stayed warm for about 20-30 minutes. Never too hot for direct contact with skin. After 2 weeks of use (maybe 1-2 x per day) it bubbled up while in microwave at 22 seconds. The smell was toxic and the wrap ruined. Will not risk it again and now searching for more stable wrap.
2,"Doesn't fit well, doesn't get cold enough.","I was never able to get this to fit comfortably. Then, possibly because of the poor fit, it never seemed cold enough to offer me relief. I've only tried it cold. Perhaps it works better hot. It is good for a flat surface like your back, shoulder blade or legs. But I didn't think it worked well as a cervical collar. I do much better with the $1.50 rectangular gel packs."
3,Gel neck collar,The contour of this item does not fit the neck area well. As a result it does not Cool off the neck area being iced down.
4,Works Well But Not Comfortable,I bought this for my wife who has been having neck aches. It works quite well and retains both heat and cold for long periods of time. The only real complaint has been that it is not entirely comfortable to wear.
3,YOU CANNOT USE MOIST HEAT WITH THIS ONE,"I needed something hot to wrap around my neck that will stay one. This one sounded good because it is a collar and has a part that goes down the back. I am instructed to use moist heat, so I use the one I have, which is rectangular, with a wet towel inside the pouch. This one came with a warning in BIG letters. DO NOT GET IT MOIST OR WET. What? Apparently, if you get it wet, the gel swells up and is no good. Plus, I am an average size 5'4"" woman, and it is too big, I can hardly fasten it. It is going back to Amazon."
3,"Carey Fails To Shed Any New Light On This Old ""Rain""","Carey returns after the GLITTER debacle with one of her patented self-empowerment anthems, very much in the vein of previous hits like 'Hero' and 'Butterfly'. While it's a solid track, it's hardly a step forward from anything that she's previously done--in fact, it sounds TOO much like many of her old ballads, which isn't necessarily bad, but is definately not going to further her cause artistically. The remixes, particularly the Full Intention mix, aren't bad either, but none rival the work she's done on previous maxi-singles with David Morales(when she actually re-recorded her vocals for the remix). Overall, it's a so-so indicator of what the forthcoming CHARMBRACELET may hold."
2,Stellar cast in eclipse,"I had high hopes for this one based on the cast and storyline. Although the cast consists of high power A listers who we have all loved in other efforts and the premise of this movie was intriguing, it all fell flat as if it had been written and possibly directed by ambitious but untalented 3rd graders. It was an okay way to kill a couple hours but I really wish William Peter Blatty or someone of similar perspective had been involved in the production."
5,DVD,The DVD arrived in good condition and the wait time was as expected. Not too long.I reccomend this seller. This movie with Denzel was one of my favorites. A whole different direction. You should get this flick.
1,Not Good,"A good friend of mine told me this movie was really good and talked me into watching it with him. Let's just say we're no longer good friends. This movie is cheesy, cliche, and doesn't make sense, and the ending makes the whole movie pointless. It is one that Denzel should leave off his resume."
3,Denzel...what happened baby?,I'm only giving this 3 stars because Denzel is fine....other than that don't bother.
2,A Bit Too Oily,"I wish I read some reviews on this product before purchasing. I had previously purchased the oil free Almay makeup remover pads...MUCH BETTER. I thought these would be similar. I was wrong!While these pads do remove all my eye makeup, it's too oily for my taste. My eye makeup ends up being smeared all over my face as I'm using these pads to remove them. I always have to keep a tissue handy as I'm using these pads. I can't wait to finish these! I'm going back to the Oil Free one!"
4,the man has style,"whether he's bringing the Buena Vista Social Club to Carnrgie Hall, or playing guitar for the Stones, this man always is innovative. Personally, he hits notes that have stirred in my Soul forever."
3,Mediocre modern Hooker,"Anyone who knows Hooker only from his mid-'80s and '90s albums knows absolutely nothing about him. While this is one of the better ""modern"" Hooker albums, minus most of the annoying guest appearances, this is not even remotely close to being prime Hooker. Everyone knows that (don't they?) Get the real thing. With few exceptions, the earlier the Hooker, the better; and the fewer musicians, the better."
3,Snake in the Eagle's Shadow,"The title on this movie is very deceiving. This is also the first movie that Jackie Chan was the star. He was very young and it doesn't really sound like him, but it was funny and the Kung Fu is great. The scenes of the cat fending off the snake was a little out of order, but it didn't distrupt the movie. If you are a Jackie Chan fan then you should see how he got started."
1,The copy Amazon is selling is not the right movie,"I've purchase and received this movie twice and when i insert the movie in my dvd it's not the right movie that's playing. It's some person having a concert. Is anyone else having this problem, shame on Amazon for distributing illegal dvd copies and selling it to customers."
2,This is not the original!,"...The original Snake in the Eagle's Shadow...is BRILLIANT. But the movie being offered is Snake in the Eagle's Shadow II, which is nowhere near as good."
1,Poor Quality,Bike lasted 1 year. Moderate use. Belt came apart when bearing went. Poor quality equipment
3,Fascinating high camp entry from the thirties.,"The first thing that strikes the eye on viewing this film is the magnificent, absolutely ravishing photography of Lee Garmes. The hokey plot deals with intrigue and romance on a train speeding through war-torn China. Marlene Dietrich is Shanghai Lily, a woman of ill-repute (""It took more than one man to give me the name Shanghai Lily""). Clive Brook is her stiff upper lip English lover(a stiff but amusing performance). With Warner Oland as a cruel, lecherous Chinese war lord and Anna May Wong as the chief victim of Mr.Oland's ""attentions"". A masterpiece of high camp, exquisite kitsch and one of the summits of exotic cinema. 31/2 stars"
5,Ska thats actually Good?!,"I may piss alot of people off here but i generally hate ska and punk because it is WAY to simple, not enough tempo changes, and i feel like im being tortured listining to it. I heard this CD at my friends house and i was blown away. I know talent when i here talent, I listin to just about every genre of music from xtreme music like black/death metal, 70s prog rock, jazz too classical, just about anything as long as the bands have talent, and this i must say is the first band in this genre i have heard that have talent(and lots of it). Good job RX bandits keep up the good work."
3,Jaun Maparez has the series,"So I found a website that offers the entire 130 episode series for $35. Pretty good deal. But before I purchase it, I'm trying to find out more about the company. Has anybody bought from or heard about juanmaparez.com???"
1,horrible copy,"I had to give this product one star so I could give a review. The one star is for timely delivery and nothing else. Copy was horrible, I've seen better pirated copies of DVDs. Audio wasn't great either. Completely unwatchable. I returned it and too gun shy to buy another one. A side note, maybe someone will come out with the complete set of Mamma's family."
5,Perfect,I have been wanting to get this for awhile for my son to remember watching these with his grandmother. It was a perfect Christmas present. He was so pleased.
1,Good to know...,...So Mama's Family is a cheap substitute? - I hate it when they change something so they can show you more commercials and then want to sell it to you as the real thing - thanks to everyone for pointing that out - I know that the streaming version of Married with Children doesn't even use the real opening theme - thanks to the internet you can find out it it's a bootleg copy.
5,RELEASE ALL SEASONS!!!!!,"I have been waiting a very long time for this show on dvd, and I can only hope that all of the seasons will be released! ""Mama's Faily"" is hands down the best show ever!"
5,The Long Wait Is Over!,"According to an online source, Mama's Family The Complete First Season will be available on DVD in the next few months! Warner Bros. has announced the set for a September 26, 2006 release. It will be a two disc set, containing all thirteen episodes from the show's premiere season. All I can say is, it's about time!"
3,Funny but not a family show,"I still have not watched all the episodes. It is really funny, but definitely not a family show with Mama's cussing and beer drinking. I will probably end up selling this one once I have viewed all of the shows. I prefer family friendly shows that I want to watch over and over."
5,Mama's Family- season 1,The product came pre-wrapped just as seller promised and in a timely fashion. I would purchase from this seller again.
3,Edited Mama,"I love the Mama's family sketches from the Carol Burnett show. Most may compare this to Tyler Perry's Madea-and I would agree. This dysfunctional family were great in short spurts.After the Burnett show left the air, Producer Joe Hamilton (at that time Carol Burnett's Husband) gathered Vicki Lawrence to replace Thelma Harper (Mama). Added to cast was Ken Berry, Dorothy Lymon and Rue McClanahan. with special guest appearance by Carol Burnett, Harvey Korman and Betty White. One would wonder why Tim Conway wasnt asked to guest star.Now the problem, these thirteen first season episodes are finely cut as they are syndicated versions. It seem jokes are missing, lines are cut-seems like this is a rough cut of the shows..this edited piece is fun, but it could be better, especially for the price you pay.There are not extras on these DVDs-one would hope Vicki Lawrence would tell stories about the character or the show-however this is not on this collectionBennet Pomereantz AUDIOWORLD"
2,A boycott only means no season 2,"Complaints should be made to Warner Home Video for using the 1986 EDITED syndication tapes, they run only 21 minutes & 30 seconds. Harvey Korman's original introductions to each episode have been edited out!BUT we should all remember that, to Warner Home Video, a boycott from buying this DVD will only mean a lack of interest in the show and no season 2 will be issued. Warner will only consider a season 2 if season 1 sells well. So a boycott could do more harm than good. Warner Home Video will not see a boycott as a dissatisfaction of their product from the fans, only complaints will do that."
3,Laces too short,"The laces were much too short for the size of the arm, those with defined arms beware."
5,THIS IS LOVE!,The very first time I heard Iio's Rapture I became hooked on them and eagerly awaited each of their releases. I've never been disappointed by them and this single of remixes is no different. Awesome!
1,Worse than useless.,This unit will pull about 5-10 feet. Then the strap on the drum jams against the frame. You now need to find a way to release the load so you can get the hoist out of the way. If you only have one lift point on the load you may be forced to cut the strap and let the load drop. The strap can be pulled tight with all of the strap off the drum. Doing this 5 times will give you the 25 feet.Do not use this unit in a critical rescue situation.
2,BEWARE THE DVD!!,"Like many people on this review site, I had fond memories of watching ""The Emerald Forest"" years ago on VHS. A lush and beautiful movie, I was eager to view it once more. However, I was in for an ugly shock. A good amount of this movie consists of the Amazon peoples speaking in their native language tongues. In the VHS version, there were clear subtitles. In the DVD version, which I purchased from one of Amazon's sellers, there were NO English subtitles. I don't where this DVD came from, but it was certainly a waste of money."
2,Great book. TERRIBLE FORMATTING!,"Fifty Famous Stories is a GREAT book, BUT get a different edition of this book if you want a paper copy. I bought it for a gift and had to return it. This one has the illustrations, but no one took the time to format the book before printing, so a page of text is often split into two pages to fit a full page illustration in between. The captions for the illustrations are often at the top of the next page instead of under the picture. This book is available for free in the public domain. There is no excuse to charge $11 for a free book that isn't even formatted correctly. That explains why this printing lacks any copyright or publisher info. This is the equivalent of printing an ebook on your home printer. Try the Yesterday's Classics edition instead."
2,NICE IMAGES,"If you're looking to buy film panoramic camera, maybe you'll benefit from this book, but if you're looking to learn about pano photography stay away. I bought mine for $2.18, so not to big of a loss.Title is misleading to us who want to learn how to take pano images with DSLR and pano heads."
3,Acceptable reformatting to DVD,"No expert in the re-digitalizing of VHS to DVD format, I can only say that the picture quality was mediocre. Hardly the fault of the seller, however, and as the product met my needs well enough, I can only suggest that the manufacturer of the disc might try again for a better result."
2,DON'T BUY IT UNTIL YOU READ THIS!!!,"Nearly all the other reviews are right...the transfer copy of this was obviously done off the TV by somebody with a subpar VHS recorder, a low-quality tape and bad editing skills. But beware...at least half a dozen cheap video companies have made their prints from the same inferior master. So don't think buying a different copy with different graphics will make a difference, it won't, it's still the same lousy print. Until a real reputable company (Criterion, Image, etc.) buys it and announces they will be putting this out, any future copies will be as bad as these. That being said, if the quality of your print matters little, then buy it and enjoy the film, it's a great one!"
2,Video,"Video quality extremely poor. I would go as far as saying it is a bootleg copy - grainy, not clear, poor sound.Not sure if it is the quality of the movie itself. Would need to compare it to another copy of the same movie."
1,Good film wasted on a lousy DVD transfer,"One of the best made-for-TV mysteries from the writing teamWilliams & Link, starring Anthony Hopkins as a doctor ponderingthe murder of his wife, is UTTERLY trashed in this atrocious DVD release. The use of a poorly-recorded source combined with a pitiful transferring effort resulting in artifacts galore, make this one of the worst DVDs I've seen."
4,Who needs Sylvan with this book,This booked was loaned to me by the school guidance councelor because our daughter was having some problems in school. I wanted a copy for myself for future reference. Things are broken down into subject and are age appropriate. I like the question and answer sections in each chapter that helped me to see that my child was not the only one with this particular problem. It was helpful by giving you ideas that you may have never thought of. It covers just about every subject you could want (except foreign language). This is a wonderful book for parents of elementary and middle school students.
2,Over priced for information included,"Excellent video for the novice person skinning and cutting up a deer. Like the other reviews, for the price I had expected to see how to field gut, how to handle deer and age. With the title of game processing, I had expected one or two other wild game products and some sausage recipes. For the information included, it is over priced. karen"
3,if Adultery is the problem......,"This is a great book if the problem is an extramarital affair. I am a Christian and I do believe allot of what he says....but most marriages are not as cut and dry as his examples and few, very few I suspect, are as wonderful as his own. When the problems seem insurmontable is when a person becomes open to an affair, and I would have liked to have seen more about how to prevent that slow decline from happening in the first place. Just saying that you should demand more respect is not very helpful!"
5,Good,Dr. Dobson is a leading author on marriage. His excellent insight into what causes crisis in marriage and how to resolve that crisis is invaluable for those wanting to save their marriage. Would definitely recommend to others.
5,Withit Library Lady,"This book has helped numerous people in a relational crisis maintain their self respect and dignity. When a spouse or significant other choosed to leave a relationship the rejected one tends to react with clinginess, groveling, and appeasement. Dr. Dobson explains why this will never work and you end up feeling really bad about yourslef, loosing self respect and dignity. In our forty years of marriage I have used some of the recommendations to navigate a marital conflict and/or crisis with success. I have also given this book to women who were going through a divorce and needed to lift up their heads and move on. The new revised book is even better than the original one published over fifteen years ago!!"
2,Best of intent?,"Having read all the bad reviews, my hopes were not exactly up regarding this documentary, but being someone who has been compelled to read all the books and everything else about Castaneda, I felt I needed to see this for myself. Probably due to the fact that my expectations were set so low, I actually did not mind seeing this. This DVD is a about a group of individuals who attended Castaneda's workshops/Sunday Sessions trying to make sense of his teachings after his passing. I found it interesting to hear their perspectives and yes I did hate the special effects. If you are a hard core Castaneda fan, you will enjoy hearing the famed man's voice."
4,pretty good; I have not been informed (or interested) lately,"This was interesting. I had read and been intrigued by the first 2 or 3 books of Carlos Castandeda's but since, hadn't ""kept in touch"". A few years ago I was talking to a woman from LA who mentioned things that this DVD discusses and explores and I was surprised, but not surprised. I thought the film was well produced (I had done a google search for Pamela Weir-Quiton because I had gone to the beginning of art school with her and was thinking about her and wondered what she was doing now, hence I found the DVD CARLOS CASTANEDA ENIGMA OF A SORCERER) Well done. Not so sure about the DVD cover slip design or some of the music but the content and production itself-- very good. An accomplished endeavor and informative to a possible, acceptable, enjoyable degree."
5,Practical Revelations about a Personal Relationship with God,"This book is the only book I have ever read (other than the Bible) that has allowed me to understand how to have a meaningful and personal relationship with God and to know His will in my life. Obedience, submit and trust are not my favorite words as a Christian, but the author sets forth in a straight forward approach the way to know God, see His will in your life, trust Him and react based upon that trust. This should be recommended reading for every member of the clergy so they would be better prepared to help their church members develop a personal relationship with God. The reader will find that if this book is read, studied and the roadmap set forth in this book followed, it will be a life-changing experience. It was for me."
5,A Practical Book,"As strongly implied by the subtitle, ""How to Live the Full Adventure of Knowing and Doing God's Will,"" this book is about application. In fact following every few paragraphs there is a section of reflective questions that summarizes the key points and help you to put them into a context for your own life.Blackaby and King describe personal experiences, but subordinate those to the Scripture. Some favorite examples from the Bible are used repeatedly in the various chapters. Model prayers are included at the end of each chapter to assist a person in praying targeted prayers.If a general theme could be drawn out from the book it would be: a relationship to God is more important than any work you do for Him. That's the essence of the book. The authors say as God reveals to you what He is doing, He invites you to join Him in His work. Consequently, listening in prayer is more important that speaking, according to this premise."
1,Sad that this was seen as so annointed by mature believers,"I personally resisted reading this because it was so well received by mainstream christians during its heyday , but finally after coming to Israel I read it when I had nothing else left . I should have went without. The book is geared to first or second year adult believers, beyond that one should already be beyond this. However the book is really into pushing building churches and the many testimonies about it from the author, personally I have little use for such things.The best part of the book is the glossary in the back which lists all the names and actions describing the L-RD , which is fun to look up each one, beyond that I would recommend not reading this book."
4,"Great, but incomplete","Box set has many of Rod's great works, but it is sadly missing his works which were released on the album ""The Earth"". So, alas, I continue to look for those great items."
4,Best of enemies,"Bend of the River is in many ways Anthony Mann's `nicest' Western, but underneath the gorgeous Technicolor location work there's a darker side to Stewart's border raider desperate to reform and his relationship with friendly enemy Arthur Kennedy that threatens fireworks to come - and when they do, in the last 20 minutes, there's no problem in believing the depth of Stewart's rage or the relentlessness of his pursuit. Shot on many of the same locations as the even darker The Far Country, it's still terrific entertainment. Stepinfetchit's role is a little uncomfortable, but compared to the humiliation inflicted upon him in other pictures he's allowed a bit more dignity here than usual, closer to Hank Worden's Old Mose Harper in The Searchers than the racial stereotypes other directors expected.As with Universal's DVD of Winchester '73, the print quality isn't always quite as good as it could be, but it's mostly an acceptable transfer."
3,"Great Movie, Poor DVD!!","This is a great film but not a great dvd. I had a password issue at the start (which was fixed by just pressing stop on the player) and then the image quality ranged from really good to really poor throughout the film. For the price I paid I can't really complain but I will. As far as the image ratio goes, according to IMDB it was orginally shot in a 1.37:1 so at this format of 1.33:1 not alot is lost. Stewart didn't film a ""widescreen"" western until ""The Man From Laramie"" in 1957 if I am correct."
3,Great film but the narrator mars the experience,"The book Celluloid Closet is a favorite of mine, and the film would be one as well except that even now, years after it was made, the knowledge that Tomlin was closeted herself when she did the narration makes it hard to watch.The ironies and hypocrisies in using Tomlin are a little distracting. They add a second layer of meaning to the narration that is a little sour."
5,A wonderful read!,"I really like Sayers's writing style. She lacks the intensity and tension found in some mystery writers, but she makes up for it with her classic style. The book is extremely well written. I definitely consider reading other books by Dorothy Sayers."
2,Disappointing,"After reading the great ""Conned Again, Watson!"", I thought this book would be interesting stories woven around physics. But the middle-school-level science is so basic that there is no mystery at all. It is obvious from the first paragraph of each tale where it is going. I quit reading after 3 stories."
5,Perfect!!!,"I can't get enough of this disc! Chan Poling, John Munson and Steve Roeh cover a variety of songs on this disc, from ""Inch Worm"" to ""The New Pollution"", from David Bowie to Blur. They sing and play their hearts out on each song making it their own, this is the way these songs were meant to be, better than the originals, or maybe the new originals."
2,Doesn't work,"YOu're supposed to be able to stamo and trace - the stamps only work with a film of orange plastic - and the faint image the stamp leaves fades in two seconds. . .not fun, not workable as a pre-writing toy - there is nothing to do with it! My 4 year old daughter has not played with it - even when I try to prompt her and play along with her. Not at all engaging. Wish I had never bought it!!!"
3,"Pieces won't stay together, disappointing for my 3 and 4 year olds",My boys love the idea of birthday cakes and so I decided to purchase this as Learning Resources tend to make quality products. My boys were very disappointed after opening this toy as the plastic candles and icing pieces kept falling off of the cake. What's a birthday cake without candles for a child? The crayons and cling on stickers don't work on the cake very well either. This is going to be donated to the goodwills soon.
5,Cakes Are Fun to Make,"Our 2+ granddaughter went right to work putting together her cake, then taking it apart and reassembling it. Just like her mother, she enjoyed her time making a delicious-looking cake. L.G."
5,Love it!,My daughter who is 3 - loves this toy. I think before you buy this you need to make sure if your child is into letters and tracing. My daughter is and she loves to trace and stamp - perfect for her. The stickers cling and uncling good. The candles are fun and icing too. She is singing constantly as she works. The crayons erase good and the orange writting/stamping pad is clear and of good quality. 5 stars!!!
4,Greyfriars,"I have a special memory of this little film when it first came out. It was paired with the original ""The Parent Trap"" starring Hayley Mills. The movie is a heartwarming depiction of the legendary Scottish dog. It is delightful for parents and children, alike."
5,Wonderful,This is a wonderful family film. I saw the Bobby statue when I was in Edinburgh in 1994. Heartwarming story!
2,Disappointed,"Four Versions Of ""The River Is Wide"" Why Wasn't The Original 45 Version Included.Ted Knop."
2,just a starting point,"Even more so than the previous versions of MS self study kits, this one heavily relies on readers to research things on their own. Also double check the ""correct"" answers in the practice exams they are not always so correct."
1,Book and Software dont work together,"Many examples in this book can not be compleated with the ""Evaluation Software"" the is included with the book. Chapters 14, and 15 both reference features not included in this version of the software.The book has been reading very nicely and I believe that I have learned a lot from it but I have become very frustrated with the way the not all the examples/practice areas can be accessed with the limitations of the included software"
5,Extremely well written,"I have been working with SQL Server since version 4.2. Since then, there have been a lot of books written, but few of this quality. The principal author has a gift for clear and succinct writing that only comes from knowing a topic well. Time and time again I marveled at how few words he used to explain complex technical topics. I recommend this book highly not only for those seeking certification, but also for those who wish to learn how to implement and maintain SQL Server 2005. Money well spent."
1,This classic deserves better,"Von Sternberg's masterpiece is a visual feast, but this DVD seems to have been made from a grainy sixteen millimeter print. It is a disgraceful disk. I have seen archival prints of this film and I KNOW this is not even close to the best print they could have gotten. Sadly, this is the first of the seven Sternberg/Dietrich films to make it to DVD, and I hope this release doesn't set a bad precedent."
1,Ridiculous movie,"Just saw this uncut on TV today. It was ridiculous beyond words. The sets with their bizarre wall decorations, troll/gargoyle chairs and statues, doors that required to two people to open them (which they did with difficulty), and the lighting which made it look more like The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari than a Russian historical film, and most ridiculous of all, the music, which varied from snippets of Ride of the Valkyries to the closing of the movie where they played the 1812 Overture!I would never consider buying this movie; I would never want to watch it again in any format, even free on TV. In spite of all the glowing reviews, I saw absolutely nothing about this movie to call it a classic, unless being old by itself makes a movie a classic."
4,"Forget it's in spanish, watch it anyway!","Even i can't stand watching a movie in spanish, and that's coming from a man who was born in South America. But i do recognize a fine movie, no matter what the language. ""All About my Mother"" is a comedy-drama about the mother who lost her only son, the way she manages to go on, and at the same time reviving her past with rare characters that have somehow affected her life. Pedro Almodovar adds his famous ""underground sex-type style touch"", making the movie much funnier and interesting. Really, if you just want to see a good movie, and perhaps one that differs from your average rentals, then don't think it twice. Besides, hey, it won Best Foreign Picture in the Academy Awards. Afterwords, if you liked watching a movie while reading the english subtitles, the I highly (*****) recommend the suspense thriller ""Open Your Eyes"" (Abre Los Ojos), another Spaniard movie...ole!"
2,All about What??,"The actresses are good. The subject/hidden feeling as explored are also good. However can't the director work out a better, compelling plot line, a reasonable/believable touching story instead of piece together his unconnected dreams??"
5,GREAT MOVIE,"all about my mother is hilarious, emotionally striking and all-around comical and a feel good film. all about my mother helps provide insight into the lives of others and the lives of people who struggle with identity and acceptance. it shows that people are people no matter what. all about my mother strongly shows the bond of love and family. highly recommended"
2,Typical Almodóvar film.,"That is, a fascinating premise that, while well-acted, manages to fall nearly completely apart because nothing is connected in a way that's necessary to keep the film coherent. It's almost series of vignettes, each weirder than the other, and each making less sense in the ""big"" story. As a result, it may be somewhat artistic in spots, but spotty as a film. You have to work for it to hold your interest."
2,small parts fall apart,"I would be happier with this jack minus the locking feature, which consists of 4 small parts that can be easily lost during assembly. I know--I lost 2 of them. So my jack DIDN'T lock.When used for a headphone extension cable, it's simple to solder the wire to the lugs. But the contacts within the jack are inexpensive.Unless you enjoy fumbling with small parts, I'd spend a little more and buy a jack that's machined to a closer tolerance. I wound up using a SWITCHCRAFT 131, a much better cable jack. It's the same cable jack used by MOGAMI."
2,"Very weak film, Nothing to recommend, Rent it First!","This film is over-long and boring. The acting is awful and it does not succed as either a comedy or a drama. Demi Moore shows that she is not afraid to take risks with her career, but she should of chosen a better script. Burt Reynolds is 'not that bad', but if you really want to see him shine I recommend 'Boogie Nights'. Nothing to recommend in this movie, except the nicely staged, and surprisingly never vulgar dance sequences, and even those are never sexy enough to make an impact. Rent it first. From a scale of 1-10 I give this film a 4!"
2,For Demi Moore's eyes only!,"The story of this movie is not much at all... actually it is weak and I knew this even before I buy this DVD.But what made it worth buying is to see Demi Moore strip for you... that's it!So if you are a fan of Demi Moore and want to see her strip for you... go for it. If not, don't even consider buying it!"
1,So what was all the fuss about?,"Just what the hell was Demi Moore trying to prove here? That she knows how to make a truly worthless film? What could have been a daring, provokative movie is rendered hopeless by an inept script. At least Ving Rhames and Burt Lancaster are fairly funny."
3,This Movie Served its Purpose,"The reality is that any skin flick is going to get panned by the critics no matter how good they are. This genera is not politically correct and we all know it.This movie was a part of Demi Moore's ongoing statement about artistic limits. The inane plot is not the focus of the movie. The purpose of the movie was to showcase Demi's body and it does a pretty good job of that.All the objections in previous reviews are valid, but they miss the point. It is too bad that the subject cannot be presented better by writers, directors and producers, but they too appear constrained by political correctness; the stripper has to be forced into the lifestyle and must escape from it, etc. etc. I enjoyed the movie for what it was, but the banality of the plot is an unecessary drag on the film. Demi could have made a wider statement if she had, or was allowed, to expand on her stated love of dancing or of turning men on, which some strippers do."
1,very weak,Demi Moore can't act.this film does her no justice and is about as believable as Burt Reynolds's hair.what a waste of film.
1,Stunningly Bad Movie,"This is a stunningly bad movie. The plot is basically Demi Moore's character as a single mom who needs money so she works in a strip club (yes, stripping) and has men problems (crappy ex-husband, lecherous politician). While Demi Moore looks great in this movie that was not even worth the two hours or so I wasted watching it."
2,NATURALLY BAD CONGRESSMAN WAS REPUBLICAN,"""Strip Tease"" was typical. In it, Burt Reynolds was depicted as so many Republican politicians are depicted: Stupid, immoral, greedy, corrupt...am I leaving anything out?STEVEN TRAVERSAUTHOR OF ""BARRY BONDS: BASEBALL'S SUPERMAN""STWRITES@AOL.COM"
2,1.5* for Cheesy Graphic Novel quality,"What could have been a great character study - a Feminist determined to provide her daughter with a wholesome life while she watches Mom take her clothes off on stage; who still fights an impulse towards exhibitionism - emerges as foolish, pandering pulp.So we have a great writer and two fine actors (Moore and Reynolds) delivering something pretty embarassing. Reynolds is awful as the sleazy politician who has his own urge to drop his pants in public.That said, Demi Moore is *the* reason to watch this movie, beginning to end. She acts well, and dances even...weller."
2,Not Region 1,"This item is not for region 1. It did not work on my laptop, but did work on my DVD player. So you might have problems."
5,Cute little wagon,"I really like this product. It was smaller than I thought it was going to be, but it worked out really well for our beach trip."
3,Handle detaches too easily!,My 2 year old got this for his birthday. It is OK for the beach toys. The wagon itself is flimsy and seems like the wheels may come off easily if any amount of weight is in the wagon (which happens with 2 years olds)... The handle falls off every minute or two which has frustrated my little guy immensely. It may be able to be fixed by securing it with some twist ties or something but until then I have to say this really is not a very fun toy for him.
3,Not that good,"It looks like you're watching a low quality copy of an anime.I'd say rate 4 (of 10) to the video and 7 (of 10) to the sound.About the anime, it's an old one like you may know and it's a Serial Experiments Lain like.A little confusing, not too much twists and you get bored many episodes.As far I know, the story begins by the end and the story of each character will completing the whole story.It's not that easy to understand, but it's a beautiful anime art.For being a classic anime I thought that was good to think that I needed this BOX - but I guess I'm not satisfied with the anime itself.Just OK for an anime.And in a comparison between this and another anime of the same kind, like *LAIN* - this one is just 2/10 of what is Lain."
3,Cornwell's adaptation of the Carlton Television screenplay..,"Although a thoroughly good read, I can't help but feel that Cornwell was forced into this by the TV producers, who refused to use his original books, and only his characters."
5,Refreshing,"Here's another 3rd season episode (see The Empath for another nearby example) that was refreshingly original. The story revolves around the Medusan Ambassador who is too ugly (or is it too beautiful?) for the eye. This episode has lots more of messages. Beauty and ugliness will be the last prejudice for humans to conquer. Like Spock said, the Greeks thought that everything beautiful was good and everything ugly was bad. Don't judge a book by its cover!Also, I liked it when Spock made a mind link with the Medusan. The ambassador offered some lovely insights into the human condition because his usual point of view is so different. This is the sort of thing that science fiction at its best ought to do. I just absolutely love this episode. Season Three is the second best season! Viva la Third Season!"
1,Defective DVDs -- Twice!,"The Hamish Macbeth series is fun, although the episodes don't follow M.C. Beaton's novels accurately. The Series 1 and Series 3 DVDs that I ordered seem fine, but the Series 2 DVD set was defective -- the first of the two DVDs wouldn't play on several players I tried. Amazon handled the returned item well, and sent a replacement, but that one had exactly the same defect -- the first DVD wouldn't play! So, I sent that one back too and requested (and received) a refund. I went to BBC America Shop and bought ""Hamish Macbeth Series 2"" and it worked just fine. So, I had to pay a higher price for the item from the alternate vendor but at least I finally got a DVD set that worked. As far as the stories, they are well-written and well-acted and I recommend them for fun and enjoyable viewing. The characterizations and plots are different than those in M.C. Beaton's books, though."
5,Is there something wrong with you?,"If you do not LOVE this c.d., there is something seriously wrong with you! It is lovely honey suckle poetry! It is teenage angst at it's best!"
5,Happy when it rains too...,"This album is by the first listen a noisy peace of crap, but after hearing it the seccond time the melodies and the lyrics creep under your skin and light up hidden places in your subconsciousness and thereby earns it's title: ""Darklands"". It has helped me through many hard times and it's a must own. Buy it and sit down with a few drinks and hear it 3 times, while reading the lyrics... The melodies have a way of sticking to places in your sole you never realized you had and bring them up to surface."
2,TM4,"This was my 1st Technomancer CD. After listening to it I got all 7 CD's in the series. This is cranking, pulsing music for rave, party, or club atmosphere. Turn on your black lite and lava lite and enjoy the wild rythyms. Hot tracks 4,9,10,11. Some tracks are somewhat ambient. Trancesetters, Meeting of the Spirits is a progressive electronic drum cut 9:22 long..it will totally take you away (whereever you might be going)"
2,"She may have been the voice, but she ain't no composer...","Like Ringo Starr without the Beatles, or Garfunkel without Paul Simon... the voices exist, but the songs are of poor quality. No hits here. Sorry."
2,Good start with a lousy finish.,Victoria Holt was a master story teller. It appears to me that she started this book before she died and then someone else finished it for her. I was sadly disappointed that the last book I was able to read of hers was so poorly done. Of all her books this is the only one I wouldn't recommend to anyone.
5,A Breakthrough Musical Effort,"This album is probably as important a work as the Beatles' ""Sgt. Pepper"" or Milton Nascimento's ""Clube da Esquina 2."" However, if your ear is not tuned to Brazilian and world music, you probably won't be able to fathom that. Brown's fusion of Bahian axe music, northeastern rhythms, bossa nova, rock, funk and reggae is really groundbreaking. To truly understand what he has done, I would recommend perusing the book ""The Brazilian Sound,"" which explains the significance of the work quite clearly and also is a great guide to Brazil's music of the last few decades."
2,Impossible to remove sticker,"Great product, but very confused why the place an advertising sticker on the product that can't be removed? I bought it for clean organized look, but it looks horrible with a half removed sticker."
2,Not critter-proof,"So I purchased this thinking it would keep mice out of my birdseed. At first, I thought this would do the trick. However, the little monsters decided to try and eat their way through the lid. Every day I would find more of the lid chewed, and tiny brown ""mouse packages"" to let me know just who the cuprits were! Eventually, after about 2 weeks, they had chewed enough of the lid as well as the sealing cord to access the birdseed. I am now left with an unusable product and some very fat mice!"
4,Fine Debut,"Truth be told, it's doubtful that the manics will ever top EMG, but this debut is as far away as that album as the uninitiated might possibly believe. That being said, at the time in the musi c industry, it was a breath of fresh air to find a balls-out rock band with a killer vocalist and subversive lyrics in the vein of the Sex Pistols. Obviously the Clash and Guns 'N' Roses influences wear heavily on this album, but it's filled with at least half an hour of brilliant material, and perhaps the most underrated tune of all time, ""Motorcycle Emptiness."""
4,Good Stuff,"Even though this cd pales in comparison to TLA's Torch, an earlier release, it still contains numerous exquisite pop tunes. Let The Rain Blow In, Sidewalks And Spaces, and Summer Books are excellent, upbeat numbers with driving bass lines and extremely catchy hooks. Other tracks like Give Me The Colors and Peel Away are somewhat vacuous, not representing TLA's true talent. This band is really awesome though. When they got rid of the old bass player, Tobin Rodriguez, I thought the band would be on the declivity. However, Tony Zanilla, the new bass player, is just as good as Tobin was, and the band's sound is more or less the same. If this is your first encounter with TLA, buy Torch. If you've heard Torch and liked it, then this is a good buy."
4,Text Book,"I got this for my History course last semester. It's essentially a grouping of journal entries, letters, and short poems by American women from various periods in history. It's good for supplementing other research but isn't very strong as a stand alone title."
2,great conversation topic,"If you believe that the purpose of advertising is to tell you the truth and that you really are free to be original in how you dress and what you eat, then this book will be revealing to you.If you are looking for good literature or to learn something about the advertising business and lifestyle, you will be dissappointed or confused at best. The story (and its storyetelling) is modelled after the same advertising the book talks about: It starts with a great promise, but it never delivers. This might be the secret message of the book. I found myself skipping pages to see if maybe something worth reading happens at the end. Well, it doesn't."
4,"Not bad, not bad at all.","A pretty decent mystery, and in a very accurately imagined / depicted world of soviet Russia.The protagonist in particular is an excellently developed character.I enjoyed it."
1,Don't waste you money,I thought this would be comparable to the other humidifiers I've seen on the web. The humidifier came apart while I was looking at it and it wont go back together. You get what you pay for I guess.
1,Mold,"Well, within two weeks, mold grew in this humidifier (am using PG and Distilled water mix), am not going to but it back in my humidor, waste of money"
2,What directions,Once again another junk product by cheaphumidors.com . no direction in package. am i supposed to fill it with distilled water or propylene glycol?
1,What is Wrong With Laurell?,"I don't get it. The first 8 books were great. Yeah, you had to get past the constant way that her guns are described and every other page having the quote, ""Like so much raw meat."" (You guys know exactly what I'm talking about.) I mean, I was finally getting into the Anita Blake series but this book has got to be the worst. Where's the plot? This whole book was sex on top of sex. It's been about 2 weeks since I read it and now, I can't even remember if there was an actual crime that took place in the book and if it was ever solved. All I can remember is the sex. This has made me so disappointed. Remind me to wait for the paperback to come out next time before I buy another one of the Anita Blake series books."
1,A weekend of hell!!!!!,"I'd like to say a big thanks to the author for putting me through a whole weekend of torture as my girlfriend read through this book. She is (or was) a big fan of the series but this book finished it. All I heard was ""This is just full of pointless sex!"" or ""All Hamilton has been doing is watching cheap porn videos!"" or ""Oh god not another deep throat scene!"". According to the girlfriend there is little of the characters of old which she enjoyed but plenty of non-plot developing sex. I did the old test of picking up the book and opening it at random at four places. Each time someone was being thrusted hard into something else. Thats a record!Please stop! Or if the publishing contract requires another book, please write it with both hands on the keyboard rather than one under the table!"
3,More plot please...BUT keep the sex also!,"I've read all of the Anita series and I worship Laurell as one of my favorite authors BUT pleeeease there could of been more plot. Thought it was great to see her with her men and was very nice to see Richard get a bit of spine back. I found myself skimming over quite a few pages because it was the same over and over again. In this book it was wam-bam ty ma'am with the murders. Don't get me wrong, as I said...keep the sex scenes but give us our marshall back for half the read too! Love you Laurell and I await the next one."
3,still worth reading,If you are a fan then it is worth reading. The author is all over the place but I think that is becouse the main character is in such flux.
1,WAY TOO MUCH SEX - and not enough real plot,"I have read and loved all of Laurell Hamilton's books - until this one. At least in the other books there was more than just sex going on and you could skip the sex parts and not feel cheated out of your money. If you tried to skip the sex parts in this book, you may wind up with about 20 pages of readable material ( and most of the real plot was rushed). I really hope her next Anita Blake novel is better and that her next Merry Gentry novel does not have the same problem as Incubus Dreams."
2,The worst of the best.,"The Anita Blake Vampire Hunter series is the best series I've read. Incubus Dreams, in my opinion, is the worst in the series. The entire book was one sex scene after the next, and I usually enjoy the sex scenes. This just became monotonous. I was at the point of skipping pages and almost forgot the original story line. Maybe Laurall was having a bad year but she's definately done better."
3,Take it or leave it,"If you like the romance/sexual aspects of this series best, you will probably like this book. If you have been reading for the mysteries/shoot 'em up scenes, you probably won't like this book.The book follows the progression of the series but things seem to have slowed to a crawl. Some will say Anita has grown up, to me it felt more like she gave up. Nathaniel's character is developing nicely, he was the best part of the book (along with Jason, who has always been the character I relate to the most).Having too much power makes the character of Anita boring. She can take down anyone and to kill her you would need to put her through a sausage grinder. Her struggles against the bigger and badder is part of what made the early stories so great.This book has put me on the fence about the series. I'll read the next one but I won't be salivating as the release date approaches.edit: For those who don't know, chapters 1-3 of Danse Macabre is available on Ms. Hamilton's website."
1,"Farewell, Anita Blake","I was browsing through the reviews of this book, and it looks like many, many other readers are as disappointed as I am. It's not just the sex. It's that we feel like we've lost a character we really enjoyed. That should tell you that Laurell K. Hamilton is capable of extremely engaging writing, but she has alienated a loyal following with this one. See my orignal review below:I so enjoyed the earlier Anita Blake books and have shared them with family and friends. I was beginning to lose interest as the content became more and more about justification for sex and less about story.Well, this one finally reached the limit of what I'm interested in. About 90 pages of story and the rest is justification of why Anita can have sex with, well, about anyone around at the time.Just not interested anymore. Give me 300 - 400 pages of the story line and you'll win me back. Otherwise, it's farewell Anita."
1,A very long typo?,"Incubus Dreams was a long book and it felt even longer. I can barley remember the plot one hour after I finished it, but I wish I could forget the awful sex-scenes. But that I hated the plot and the sex is only a personal opinion. The worst about the book is the editing. There are typos on almost every page. That is simply unacceptable."
2,Hamilton's wish fulfillment?,"Hamilton seems to have come down with Anne Rice syndrome. Extremely popular and selling well, so she decides she doesn't need an editor.Wrong! I lost track of the typos - sometimes three separate spellings of the same word on the same page. Is this minor? Yes, but it shows that not much care was taken with the manuscript - even down to using a spellchecker. Other people have mentioned the gaping plot threads; again, a good editor with the power to make suggestions can help resolve this.Much of the omni-present sex seems pointless. Okay, succubus line of vampires blah blah blah, but when the (previously strait-laced) heroine is banging every guy around and they're all blessed with enormous schlongs, that dives into the realm of Mary Kay fanfic."
1,Vampire Hunter to Sex Fiend,"I have always admired the kick-ass, hard nosed Anita Blake. From the beginning I was hooked by her wit, wicked tongue and no nonsense attitude. Now, she's using that wicked tongue in ways that I don't even want to think about, let alone read. A little romp here and there is fine and dandy, but, good grief, I can't even finish the book. She has had sex in the last 3 chapters that I have read, and I'm sick of it. Leave a little to the imagination, Laurell....Please! I think I'm done with Anita Blake and Laurell Hamilton! PS. I'd give this book less than 1 star, but they won't let me."
2,So dissapointed!!,"I was very much anticipating the next book after Cerulean Sins. I couldn't wait to see the conclusions of the story lines left hanging. I was sad to see that none of them were addressed in this book. Don't get me wrong, I like the sex scenes in all her books, but this one seemed to focus on only sex with a murder as a kind of afterthought. I loved the whole series until this one. The reason I loved the series was for the characters you came to know & love, Anita's jobs and the mystery. This book is sadly lacking in those areas."
2,Should I even finish this?,"I am about 2/3 of the way through this book and went on line to determine if I should even bother to finish reading it. These sceenes are so muddied and boaring. No-one goes through this much mental anguish for 4 to 5 books. Anita had a personality before she had to start second guessing herself all the time, where did it go? PS. LKH, editors, publishers, why should anyone else spell check their work, it you can print books with this many errors."
1,Beyond Disappointing......,"After having finished the latest installment of the Anita Blake series, I have to wonder if Hamilton has been researching ""Letters to Penthouse"" for material.What happened to the creative story telling that put her on the New York Times Best Seller List? About a fourth of the way through ""Incubus Dreams"" and I'm begining to wonder if there is going to be any type of story or if it is simply going to page after page of Hamilton's fantasies in vivid detail.I think I'll pass on future installments."
2,Incubus Dreams,I am glad that I read it using a library copy. I am not sure that I will pick it up when I see it as a paperback at a used book store.
4,Can't wait for the next book.,"Although this was an obvious set up for the next book, I liked ""Incubus Dreams"". While the sex scenes (great fun, as usual) did seem to be unusually numerous, they were also a big part of the story line. Without them, I don't think the reader would appreciate the importance of the ""ardeur"" to the story and the extent that it affected the lives of the lead characters. Clearly, Hamilton is building up to something big with the unsolved murder, the ""Wicked Truth"", and the changes in the character dynamics. She's never disappointed me yet and I can't wait for the next book."
2,Diehard Fan Dissapointed,"Ok, I've been a diehard LKH since Guilty Pleasures, I've read all her work I can get my hands on, but I'm sorry, this book sucked! What happened to the hangers in Cerulean Sins, what happening with the Mother or Darkness thing? Theres maybe 30-40 pages of grisly crime tops, page 74 on is all SEX! I mean, don't get me wrong , its nice, but not 700 pages worth of it!Some things here are dealt with I guess, with plp psycho-analyzing other people, and some metaphysical twists, but the whole book from page 100 on is just so....predictable, except maybe which stranger Anita's gonna screw next. What happened? Wheres the plots, the twists, the thrill I used to get reading about Anita's adventures? I paid $8.00 for a porn! Im sorry laurell, but I hope your books take a turn for the better, but of the reviews on Micah, im starting to lose hope. Cross your fingers in July for Danse Macrabe...."
2,Two and a Half Stars...,"It would be interesting to divide the book up and compare how much of the book is spent having sex vs. how much on the actual plot? The plot itself is introduced but never followed through. So many story lines are left hanging in the air, including the case she was on about a serial killer that didn't manage to be solved in 658 pages. Her characters, as always, are engaging but her story lacks anything solid to stand on.Read it if you've read the other books in the series, if not, don't bother. That's the only reason why I read it - even though the last one and this one are very disapointing to say the least, I feel obligated to finish out the story of Anita Blake."
2,losing focus,"well, I just finished reading this book for the second time, and I was very disappointed. When this series first started out they had a well defined plot, great side stories and every character was someone you could get to know. In this book, the story takes a back seat to all the sex. Although they are well writen, the sex scenes take up far too much of the book. The actually mystery that Anita is supposed to be solving is bearly mentioned. There were plenty of good parts too this book, but I just don't think that it comes anywere close to being as good as her earlier novels. I am re-reading burnt offerings today, and I am surprised at the difference in quality of the two books. If you are a big Anita fan read the book, but wait till it comes out in paperback."
1,Porn in disguise,"What happened to Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter?This series has jumped from one genre to another.If I want to read porn, I will buy porn.And that is what this book is. Porn. Tasteless, at that.If you are going to write porn, just do it. Focus on the main objective and go with it. Do not hide it behind a mask, deceiving new and old readers alike.This book does not belong with other Horror/Fantasy/Mystery/SciFi titles.I agree with so much stated by previous reviewers, why rehash it all?I do NOT recommend this book unless you are looking for supernatural smut.In which case, dive right in."
2,This is what I waited a year and a half for?!?!?!,"I am very dissapointed in this book. Anita Blake novels have been like a drug to me, and this one just didn't give me my fix. What happened to all the action? I want my bad-ass vampire hunter back!!! I love the characters, and I was glad that we got a little history on Damian, and some more insight on Jean-Claude, but overall it was a big let-down. Thw whole book, I was sitting there asking myself, where is the big bad that she always battles? Anita has been going down hill since Cerulean Sins, where she gained these new powers all of a sudden at the end of the book to defeat Belle. I just thought it was all starting to go a little overboard. I love Anita Blake, and I will continue to read the books, but I can't help but ask myself if it's time for Laurell to put an end to the series.P.S. I enjoy sex in the books, but not as the only thing. If I wanted to read porn I would pick up some of my mom's old romances."
2,Laughable,"Wow, LKH has really done it this time...I thought that since she made Anita out to be kind of a slut in Cerulean Sins that maybe she'd let Anita take a break for once. Apparently I was very wrong, I've been reading some of the reviews and there's not really much to say that hasn't been said. I'm still going to stay loyal to the series but please Laurell, I can't take anymore repitions of the words 'breast' and 'meat' anymore. And since when does Anita say something like ""I want to see if I can deep throat you"". Maybe something Laurell or I might say but not the prude vampire-killing sociopathic bitch from hell I've grown to love and care about. Stop the Madness Laurell!"
1,I honestly can't remember what happened...,"Boring. I just want to reflect on what that word means.uninteresting, tiresome, dull, monotonous, unexciting...All of these are very apt words to describe the quality, the storyline, the plot-- Well, just about everything about this book.I've tried to ""read deeper"" into what Anita is going through. I've tried to see her incessant humping as ""character growth"". But frankly, the only thing I saw growing was the amount of men in her ""hisem"" and the bits and pieces of said men.I'm not going to wait and see what happens next. I refuse to see if she pulls out of this slump or decides to put more effort into writng a good novel. I've already given this woman a buttload of my money and I don't intend to give her any more.And I just want to say that I'd really have loved to give it a negative score but they don't have that option."
1,like a metaphysical penhouse forum -very disappointed,"I have always loved the Anita Blake Vampire Hunter books. I have read every single one published to date. But, this is ridiculous! It's just page after page of sex with vampires and wereanimals. Besides, there is something bizarre about the S&M fixation. A little sex adds spice to a good novel. But, the basis for the novel should be it's plot. This book had a poor plot line thrown in, so Ms. Hamilton could publish blatant pornography and call it a novel. Yeah, I read all of it, but I won't bother with the any future books in the series. I just can't express how much it saddens me that such a fun series should become have evolved into such complete trash."
1,Don't waste your time or money,"I read most of the other reviews before I bought the book. I thought, ""Well, maybe they don't know the series that well"". If you haven't read most of the other books in the series, you won't understand where some of the angst comes from.I was extremely disappointed by this book. Okay, I admit, I was getting a little tired of Anita's whining anyway. I mean, c'mon, if you live in that world, you need the power, right? Just take it!! AAAARRRGGGHHH!!I was so fed up with the sex, I started flipping pages halfway through. There is no plot, period. I like paranormal mysteries/adventure stories. I like novels about kick-ass women. I'm all for a steamy vampire book. This was neither one. All I can say at this point is, Laurell, work out your issues in therapy, not print."
1,Incubus Dreams,"I truly wish Ms. Hamilton would go back to writing prose instead of sex. This book had no story. I don't mind reading about sex if there is a story, but this was the worst book I have ever read by Ms. Hamilton. If the next Anita Blake book is not any better it will be that last one I ever read."
3,"It's bad, but I liked it.","Ok, so I've never read any of Laurell K. Hamilton's books before. This was just a random buy at the airport because I needed something to read to on the plane. I usually like vampire stories, this was supposed to be a murder mystery as well, so I thought I should be pretty entertaining. And, it was entertaining. The murder mystery was totally lost in all the sex and the psycho-analyzing, but I still enjoyed it. I agree with everyone that says it was soft-core porn with some other stuff thrown in, but Hamilton is obviously a good writer who has developed an intricate and compelling cast of characters. I intend to read her earlier books whenever I need some light fiction."
3,"where's my gun-totin', bad guy killin', Exicutioner?","I have been reading the series sense 1995, when Guilty Plesures was a new release. I emediatly fell in love with the crime solving, supernatural totin big bad s$$ in a small package. I still love Anita, but all the sex and second-guessing takes something away. I really Missed Edward. I would be estatic if there was a spin off one shot book just about his adventures.I still loved the book, and several parts were wonderfull, the rescue mision for Ronnie at the book's name sake was my fav. but its getting to the point that I can't recomend the latter books to some of my friends, cause I know they would be uncomfortable with some of the sex parts,The side story line that could have been: Accualy having Evan look into the murder of the kids at the beginnig. As is it was ignored for the entire book, then revisited and left dagling."
3,SEX,"...expect A LOT of it. I though Laurell would get the need for gratuitous sex out of her system with the Merry Gentry series, but I am proven wrong. Not only is there a lot of sex, but Anita's character has now accepted all the random sex. There was the hint of a plot, and unlike Cerulean Sins, we actutally saw Anita at work...briefly.Plus side, at least Richard is once more loveable."
3,"good, but tiresome","i'm am a huge fan of the series. the whole premise and concept blew me away, ran through the first 11 in the series the way Grant took Atlanta. maybe it's me that had hopes for Incubus Dreams set to high, but after much anticipation, i was disapointed. the book is a little over 650 pages. it's 90% sex, and 10% mystery. i would have preferred a little more balance. i enjoy sex as much as the next person, but after about 400 pages of it, it wears a bit thin. it almost seemed that a great deal of it was just for shock value, not the story line. i so wanted to love this book too, i just couldn't."
1,What Happened to the Stories I used to Love,"I like many of the other people who have posted am tired of the porn in favor of plot. The series used to be great with the vampire hunter trying to keep from falling into the monstrous world she was fighting. Every story had at least three plotlines that twisted into a wonderful climax that left me saying, ""Wow!"" However, since ""Obsidian Butterfly"" sex has overtaken both plot and relationships. Bring back the Anita I love or let her die."
3,Enjoyed but.....,"Have the agree with a lot of the other reviews here. I enjoyed the book, having read all of the other Anita Blake series, but the sex scenes are becoming the majority of her books. More plot PLEASE! By the middle of the book I found myself skimming through the sex scenes trying to find where the plot picks up again. I have NEVER done with with one of LKH's books. I understand the whole JC's ""power is sex related"" thing, but in the next book could you have Anita crawl out of bed ONCE in a while and take care of business? Some sex is fine but It's her business that readers find so fasinating."
2,Jumping the shark,"When I saw the size of Incubus Dreams, I felt like I had been given a special gift. I wait impatiently for each of Laurell K. Hamilton's books to be published and this was just more to savor. It's sad to be wrong, especially on your birthday. Remember the good old days when Anita would kick butt to save the day? Now she just has sex. A lot.While I lament the loss of a great series, I am still grateful that the author has given me so much entertainment over the years. If you are a fan, please do yourself a favor and skip this book. I would have much rather seen Anita killed off than brought to this boring and drawn out low."
1,Anita Deserves Better...,"This series has gone steadily downhill for the last 3 books, in my opinion. LKH has taken a strong female character and turned her into a nymphomaniac. If there was a plot to help things along, I wouldn't mind so much, but Incubus Dreams has almost zero plot.Bring back Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter!"
2,Ouch...,"I finished this book, with all its glorified 600+ pages in less than 24 hours. How? I skipped over half of it. How could I not? If I wanted to read erotica, I would've bought something else. If I wanted to read erotica, I wouldn't have bought this book. ""Anita doesn't do furry."" Oh no, Anita does anything now, with or without fur."
2,Pure Crap.,"This book completes the destruction of the Anita Blake character. This series used to be one of my favorites, but now... I mean I could take it when she had two lovers, I could understand that. When they added in Micah I'm still like okay what the heck it's still a good series with great writing, so okay I'll go along with it. In Cerelean sins Anita got like two more boyfriends and I'm thinking well it was still a pretty good book so I might as well see the series through. Now with this book she seems to be screwing every guy she sees, so enough is enough I mean, Hell, I could take all this if the story was still good, but if I just wanted porn I would've spent the money on nice video instead of this crappy book. The Author has taken a strong character and turned her into lord knows what."
2,Hope the next one is better,"Okay, don't get me wrong, I'm all for a little steamy sex thrown in, but this was basically the whole book. The plot...uh, was there one...was totally buried and/or ignored for the majority of the book. I'm all about Anita embracing her own monsterness, but where are all the other characters we love. ASHER? EDWARD? DOLPH? Please LKH, keep the steamy scenes, but insert some plot somewhere along the way."
3,I didn't think sex could be this boring!!,"I LOVE the Anita Blake series...up until this one.The story is all about sex, which in itself would not be bad but all Anita seems to be doing is well...doing it...over and over with anyone and everyone...in detail...again and again...I miss the other books where there was actually a story. I have about a quarter of the book to go...I may just forget about reading the rest...."
1,Just Adding My One Star,"Don't waste your time or your money. If you want to read something, read the rest of the reviews. I wish I had."
3,A couple days in the life of...,"Well... It was long.And I appreciated that. Really. Because I like this world so I wanted a well rounded feel. So that Ronnie was back (a little) was nice. That Richard seemed to be dealing more was nice. That Anita was not as judgemental and seemed to be growing up and becoming an adult was nice. Change is good.There are so many characters at this point that I really can't care about all of them. Maybe, as the reader - from Anita's POV, I'm not supposed to though. More edittig could have gone into this, however. At points there was a lot of repeat writing, which I guess can be excused because it's in Anita's head but... lord. And EVERY guy was just SO impressed by her. She was just so great in bed. Good for her, but she must not be somebody's type.Oh well. Still liked visitting the world. Still miss Edward. Still think her harem of men should be trimmed down just a bit."
2,Wish I'd waited to buy it...,"Man, that was $16 down the drain. I really liked this series before, but this book, well, it was about NOTHING. Another reviewer has already posted the sexual body count, but LKH barely even addresses the actual dead bodies - you know, the murder victims? What happened to - Anita, champion of those helpless against supernatural evil? Now its all - Anita, product of sensitivity therapy and nymphomania.I just don't know if I will buy the next one. She might have killed it for me. Hopefully she won't mess up her Meredith Gentry series like she did this one."
1,Nothing but soft-core porn now,"I'm probably one of the few men who love*d* LKH and her books. I was punching through her books one every couple of days... they were that engrossing. But now, all her books are nothing but soft-core porn. Anita Blake has gone from a small, kickass girl to a nymph that screws anyone she can. Her stories have gone from mystery, suspense and adventure, to sex sex sex."
1,Yuck.,"My family loves to read books together. Whatever my parents read, I read. We started reading this series a while ago, but with this book...we have stopped.I may be young, but I can read a sex scene without getting giggly or uncomfortable.But this book? Was just TOO MUCH. Seriously. I thought at any moment that Anita would just drop anything and start having sex with random people - Oh, wait! She DID that!I can't believe LKH could publish this book and walk out into the light of day after doing so. If I wrote something this disgusting and, honestly, perverted, I'd lock myself in a dark closet somewhere out of shame.YUCK."
2,What happened to Anita?,"As can be seen by the majority of reviews- Too much sex and not enough Executioner. I'm no prude and have enjoyed the sex in the previous books, but they weren't the main thrust (pardon the pun) of the story, and didn't go on endlessly- the stories were mysteries and that is what I liked about them. If I wanted a pure sex romp I would read her Meredith Gentry novels."
3,Okay...how many people can Anita have sex with???,"This series is going, going.. hopefully not gone.Anita Blake-The Executioner. That was great reading. Anita Blake big skanky slut is not so great a read. Sure it is magically induced ""Ardeur"" but...I miss zombies, solving murders and shooting the bad guys. I MISS tough Anita who was the underdog who succeeds against the odds. Super Anita who easily wins because she out sexs, out magics, out supers the bad guys is getting OLD fast.The Meredith Gentry series is actually getting more character and less orgy driven and Anita Blake is going the other way. Sad, sad day when Anita Blake is in a downward spiral. I am sticking with it and hoping for a series recovery but losing hope as story lines are getting flimsy, and developed character traits and back stories are ignored."
1,BOOOOOOOOOORING,"I never thought I'd say this but Ms, Blake needs to get her life back. She has to have sex so often I don""t see how she can even stand up. Ms Hamilton , please give us Anita back. So much sex so often becomes booooooring. The plot line gets lost, the charactors lose thier appeal, and the book drags, and drags. I swore I would stop buying these books , but I failed. I still have hope Hamilton will turn it around and write a book like she is capable of. not this one though.... booooooring."
3,the whole time i watched this i wanted the other scouts,"A must have for any moonie, since it is the beginning of it all. I've actually decided to learn some japanese so I can watch the original japanese versions. They are much better. No lie. I really don't like molly's accent. It really bugs me. The movie's okay, but serena just can't survive on her own. It's a start though."
1,A Moon Star Is Born?!?! I Don't Think So.,"Sailormoon is one of the best animes I know. However, this dub is an insult to the real, original, JAPANESE version. I have seen all 200 japanese episodes, and the dub doesn't even come close. I don't reccomend getting this video unless you don't want to see the original version"
1,A Moon Star is Born: Thumbs up or down?,"This movie was okay, although there were a few mistakes. This was an original japanese series, and the movie cut out scenes from the japanese. Some of the content was hard to understand due to the cutting. That's why I only gave it one star. END"
2,Dead fish,"I bought this on a recommendation and used it with my 40 gallon tank that has been up for over 25 years. Within hours of the initial usage I lost a angel fish and a tiger barb. I have not put it in my tank since and have had no other instances of fish dying. I followed the directions precisely so I'm not really sure what happened, but have no interest in testing again."
1,Some of the worst dialogue I've read in a while...,"don't get me wrong, i can appreciate bad dialogue, but this just hurts."
2,NOT AT ALL DURABLE,MY SIX YEAR OLD GOT THIS FROM SANTA FOR CHRISTMAS. HE HAD A WONDERFUL TIME WITH IT....UNFORTUNATLEY HE ONLY USED IT THREE TIMES BEFORE IT BROKE. NICE IDEA...NOT AT ALL DURABLE. I WONDER IF THEY SELL REPLACEMENT PARTS....
2,Not So Chilling,"This is a rather disappointing, and ultimately pretty incoherent, ghost story. I think.There are a number of holes in the script and direction, and not even the good acting can overcome these problems.Strangely, given the lengths to which the production went to create the reality of the chilling winter in which our two protagonists are stranded in a road accident, the couple doesn't actually seem very cold. In the ""making of"" featurette, they seemed to be shivering and showing their breath, but these effects weren't very visible in the movie itself.Emily Blunt struggles gamely here, and even does one of the most credible American accents by a British actor that I've ever heard.But ultimately the film really doesn't hold together very well, and you will likely wind up scratching your head and saying, ""huh?"" at the end.Blunt deserves much better material, and I hope she finds more projects like ""The Young Victoria,"" in which she glows like a bright ember."
2,Lame-O,"I saw the pedigree on this (Clooney, Sonderbergh), and figured the film might be a first class effort at doing a B flick. Folks, you've seen better on Sci-Fi channel original efforts. The actors are good enough - Ashton Holmes in particular seems a gifted actor trying to make the most of it. And Blunt is also fine, as an unsympathetic character, who you warm a bit to as things get chilly. But the real problem is the script, which goes no where, which is odd, given that snowstorm plus stranded car, with spectral things outside, is kind of hard to mess up for your average horror audience. Wrong. It's like the director went with an early draft of something that no one bothered to polish a bit, or even think much about. It's about as empty an hour and half of movie watching as I've had in some time. And I'm a fan of the genre who will usually cut such flicks a break. Not this time. Skip this turkey."
1,Warning you may receive wrong CD,"This CD is listed as being by Madame X the R&B girl group. What you get is a CD by some rock group of same name, which is same as the picture (girl on green background) but does not match the description. If you are looking for Madame z/Klymaxx-produced music, do NOT order this CD!"
5,Good Mint,Purchased candy after eating it while I was on vacation at a hotel. It was delicious! The mint is not overbearing and sweet.
1,No thanks,"This cookbook is so un-inspiring. I love to cook and have fun trying new recipes, but not with this cook book. I was staring at it last night, looking for something to make later this week. I couldn't find one thing in the book that I wanted to make.So far I have made the Bacon-onion chip dip, which wasn't very good. My husband thought it was too cheesy, which is odd since he loves cheese. I also made one of the chili dishes, which was fine, but not as good as your basic Better Homes and Gardens recipe.This book has 10 chili recipes, and 8 stew/pot roast recipes, which I don't really like. If you like heavy meat dishes, or can't get enough chili this might be the thing for you."
5,Excellent,I love Barbara Bonney's voice. She is one of the few sopranos that I actually enjoy hearing.
1,"Worst movie I have EVER, EVER seen","There is no way that anybody should see this movie. This is the most vulgar, unfunny piece of xxxx ever. The storytelling is hysterically bad, the acting is terrible. The only thing they do is try and shock you with vulgarity. I loved Trainspotting, but absolutely hated this one."
1,Horrible!,"I rented this movie last night after I read this reviews, to see if it was really that bad. And yes....it was terrible! The movie had a stupid plot that was not interesting at all, the acting was very unconvincing, and the movie was just boring. Not even the sex scene that everyone has been talking about was enough to keep viewers interested in the movie. This movie isn't even worth the $3 dollars I payed to rent it, and I should have listened to those people who said ""don't waste your time and money."""
5,"Inspiring, Deep ...",This is a beautiful cd that will inspire you to just ADORE and WORSHIP the LORD...
2,"OK, but not as good as i had heard","I had heard that this was some seminal work in the history of literature. Maybe that's because i was living in Iowa City at the time, or maybe some people just like stories of guys getting F'd up. I for one wasn't very satisfied. It read like a million little pieces if written by a junior high student."
5,Life as seen through many of our eyes!,Thank you for allowing me to visit with you. This book of life you shared helps in the filling of that large empty hole we all carry with us. Jean Andre Vallery
2,Broke 10 minutes after they were opened,Bought this for my dad for his birthday. He took them out of the box to put on his 5th wheel right away. As he held them up they clinked together and one of the globes broke. What a disappointment. They are cute but not worth the money.
5,Super Fun,Had a hard time thinking of a gift for a father who has everything! He loves to drink Budweiser beer and bought him a couple for his man cave and he loved them!
3,nothing,"im very torn in regards to this book. looking at it strictly as a novel, i enjoyed it like i have enjoyed all other salvatore works, despite the fact that drizzt is very scarce in the book. BUT, looking at the book in regards to what it was supposed to do, i was disapointed. nothing is resolved in the book. i dont see the point of having made it a trilogy. if anything, the hunters blade trilogy seems like one long book leading up to something. im glad to see that the drizzt and co storyline will continue, but i got no closure from this book. little was contributed to the overall story. this is made even worse considering that salvatore is taking a possible 2 yr withdraw from the drizzt storyline to work on jarlaxle and artemis books. as a book it was an exciting read, but it dint deliver what it was supposed to. i am a huge fan of salvatore and it pains me to give this such a low score"
2,Stale and Mediocre Conclusion to the Series,"Let's face it, R.A. Salvatore has somewhat lost his touch. As of late, his books just are not up to par as to how great he used to be. I think back on some of his earlier work such as The Dark Elf Trilogy and the Demon Wars and then I read this one and I shake my head in disappointment. Salvatore's Drizzt books used to be so great and unpredictable but now it's all changed.This book was quite stale. You had Bruenor on his death bed but yet the entire thing was pointless because you KNEW that he was going to come back to life. The fight scenes were OK but even those were not as good as Salvatore back in the past. Whatever happened to good old one-on-one fight scenes that RAS excelled in?In order for Salvatore to spice up his Drizzt series, he needs to refresh it by letting some of his main characters die. It is far past due for a major death to take place.Overall, ""The Hunters Blades"" trilogy was a poor series and nowhere near Salvatore's earlier work."
3,a good book but only a bridge not an end!,"I also own and have read and reread all of the dark elf books and love this character. This book was a real let down as far as an ending, and the character was really dull at the end. You expected so much more from Drizzt and from Rob that i wish he had put more time into this. Hopefully he can put the zap back into his character before the next book. SPOILER>>>>> also upset that the book flap review hinting that Drizzt would have to choice between life and death when the scene never got that much energy. this was a big let down!!"
2,Same ole Same Ole...not much original thought here,"Mr. Salvatore seems to have run out of orignial ideas and new plots. This book is same ole...same ole...And since none of his main characters ever dies, there isn't much suspense in the battles. Plus just how many different ways can you continue to chop up an orc or a troll and make it interesting? When he first introduced us to Drizzit, each book was a brand new adventure with new and exciting characters and action. Now it seems that if you have read one you have read them all. I wish the author would get inspired and give us something new and exciting. And occasiontaly kill one of the characters. After all, evil does triumph now and then. Finally, why call this a triolgy? It certainly did not have an ending!"
2,Uneventful: More of the same old.,"Once again Drizzt runs through impossible obstacles in invincibility mode. I've read many of Salvatores works and it's just more of the same. He keeps creating new stories for his bread and butter character which have grown so stale that were at one time creative nd suspenseful. Drizzt always comes out on top. Wulfgar is always torn between the same emotions that he only knows how to deal with in his barbarian rage. If this is your first venture into Salvatore's world you may enjoy it. But long time readers are likely to be bored with the same old same old. Read War of the spider queen book one instead. It's actually versatile, creative, and multidimensional; what a good fantasy book should be. Note: I am referring to the entire trilogy no just book 3."
1,Simply Terrible,"With this series, Salvatore has become incredibly stale. His storylines have become incredibly predictable. In order for me to maintain interest in Salvatore's currently very bland work, he NEEDS to kill off one or a few of the main characters. The near-death teases are ridiculous because you already know that the character isn't going to die."
4,"Oh, Please not Catti-Brie!","While I think its about time Drizzt was with a female, not Cattie-Brie! I have not ever liked her from The Crystal Shard! And besides, she's human and like what? 40 years old or so? Hey, she will be an old woman in another 30 years and Drizzt will just finally be an adult elf at about 100. Do us a favor R.A. and set Drizzt up somebody half-elven at least. Then they at least have a chance at some sort of relationship. You could play on the fact that half-elves have trouble being accepted in both human and elven worlds. I just say again, NOT Cattie-Brie!"
4,"Good, but not as good as it should have been","Mr. Salvatore has done it again here. He's taken his characters and run them through the drama mill. It's a great book, but I feel like the ending to this series should have been a little more conclusive. I won't spoil the ending or anything. If you've read the other two in this series, then you have to read this one. I enjoyed it, I just feel that it could have been better."
2,It's getting old,"The plot of this book is basically the same as the previous six or seven books based on Drizzt and co, and while the first Drizzt books were great it's getting really old. Drizzt has angst, drizzt runs away, drizzt faces his enemy... sound familiar? I also cannot figure out the point of the trilogy, the situation at the end of the book is basically the same as the situation at the beginnng, nothing has been resolved. What was the point of all those hundreds of pages? I'm still guessing. Overall not worth reading."
5,Great info about the Riemann Zeta function,"This is a great resource about the Riemann Zeta function. A good chunk of the mathematics in this book is beyond me, but the value nevertheless was immense.A great resource and important book."
5,The Only Microeconomics Text You Will Ever Need,"Having been an advisor to transition economies on transforming their tax systems to assist in the move to a market economy, I can unequivocally state that this book is the clearest explanation of why individuals and firms benefit from the freedom of the market. As one of my good friends from the London School of Economics says, `Stigler is light on math but heavy on economics.'"
2,Uncomfortable,"This chair is really uncomfortable. I tried to get used to it for two months, unfortunately with no luck. Save yourself all that pain and simply get a conventional chair."
2,No more comfortable than a $10 folding chair,"Although a well made, sturdy piece of furniture, after having owned it less than a month, I am convinced that although it seems like a good idea, the chair isn't very comfortable, and though it might help with back-pain sufferers who have a tendency to slouch, the seat and ""knee cushion"" are uncomfortable after sitting for longer than a half-hour. My advice? Spend the 100 bucks on a decent ""traditional"" computer chair."
3,"Not excellent, just good.","Instinct wasn't a bad film. I didn't think that it was that original, but it still no doubt was watchable and not poor. I thought that the acting by all was better-than-good (especially Anthony Hopkins as always). Instinct delivers a good message. It reminded me a bit of other movies I've already seen though. I doubt I'll watch this again, but I still consider it to be a pretty good movie."
2,Hopkins and Gooding Jr. make the film watchable,"Instinct is basically every good thriller you ever saw mashed into one movie and given a philosophical message. The message is that humanity needs to stop what he is doing and get back to being one with nature. Yeah, okay, are you done laughing? The "" philosophers "" who are praising this film for it's "" poignant "" message on Amazon.com probably don't recycle, litter on the highway, and can't name 12 species of animal in their frontyard. Still, they swear up and down that mankind has lost his connection with Mother Earth. The film is laughable, but the performances of Hopkins and Gooding Jr. carry it. The script is a joke, the direction is lacking, and the "" message "" appeals to naive Generation X'ers."
4,Really good,I usually dont like action/DRama movies but this one was really good. I mean some parts where a little whered out of it but the rest of it was written really good. I sugest that you go rent this movie right know.
3,Meh...,"I really like MF Doom, and wanted to hear Grimm try and shine. It's ok, I see why Doom went solo though...just not one of my favorites"
4,It's Back!,"This was one of those movies they played on T.V. every summer when I was a kid (could have sworn it was called 'the Glass Onion' or something like that). A really fun movie. I was told a few years ago that the movie had been lost forever, so I'm thrilled to see it available."
2,Doesn't tuck in!,"It does seem to protect the mattress...when it isn't moved by my son. It does NOT tuck into the twin mattress so if my son takes a while to go to sleep or moves it, it is useless. I bought 2 but would not buy again. I'd find a larger one that tucks."
5,Waterproof sheet protector,Purchased for elderly family member. This protector works very well and absorbs a lot of liquid. There have been times when they have gotten up in the mornings soaked but the protector kept the bed dry.
5,Just what I wanted,Just what I wanted. Didn't want any uncomfortable plastic. Soft and durable. Bought two for when one is in the wash.
2,Not for children under the age of 12,Label says not for use by children under the age of 12. I would assume it has something to do with the thickness of the pad and SIDS. Amazon should state this on their site. Returning it.
1,Sheet protector leaked through - does NOT protect,"Item arrived promptly. Contained odd warning about not using with children, but others have commented on that.Physically it appeared to match product description.The first time I used it, I was pleased to see that although it had gotten wet overnight, it felt dry to the touch on top. So my child was clean and comfortable.Changing the bed later I discovered WHY it was clean and comfortable on top - it leaked through completely and the bedding underneath was soaked through.I do not recommend this product if you are trying to prevent moisture from reaching the bedding or the mattress. It did keep my child dry, but other options do both."
5,Does exactly what it claims...,I love this product. I use it on my Toddler's bed and its perfect. Just purchased another one for when I put the first one in the wash!
3,"Absorbency alright, durability questionable","I purchased 3 of these for my disabled child who wets through significantly overnight, even with a depends on. After only 3 months of washing and drying, the waterproof lining has already started becoming separated from the outer layer of the underside of the pad - or getting stuck to the inner layer? Either way, where that one inch spot is ripped, any urine will leak through the pad and onto the sheets. Bought same size pad in the ""Original blue max"" brand last month and can already see they are more durable...and they were $3 less each!"
5,updating Raising Lifelong Learners,"Raising Lifelong Learners is a great book and a fabulous parent resource. I utilized the information as a parent and for the past ten years have incorporated the various topics into parent workshops. I like how the book is written as a parent guide that teachers can also tap into. I have a suggestion that hopefully Ms. Calkins sees valuable; Raising Lifelong Learners needs to be either revised and/or updated. The Common Core Learning Standards, the National Standards being adopted by most of the states, needs to be part of the text and included in the academic subjects. The book was written in 1997, parents would greatly benefit in reading the most up to date information. I have not found another book as resourceful and nurturing as this book and and an updated version would directly help in training and supporting parents."
5,"good range, good functionality, good battery life","The range is excellent, I use it some fifty feet away from the basestation in the buildup of my house. I like that they have both a local display & transmit their readings. Battery life is many months (I have some that have been running for a year and a half now)."
2,WARNING: Read this review before purchasing,"WARNING: This product ONLY flies straight up and down. This is a two-channel helicopter which means it only lifts off and spins in place. You cannot fly left, right, forward or backward. You can buy a similar RC helicopter that actually flies around for roughly the same price if you shop around. Even if you have never flown an RC helicopter before, you will get bored with this product after about 2 hours. It is sturdy enough to handle several crash landings (and you will crash it) so the construction or durability is not an issue. The fact that it is only two channels is the problem. Do yourself a favor and buy something that is 4-channels."
2,Dragonfly Helicopter Refview,"This is called a "" 2 Channel "" helicopter, which means there are only 2 directions for the helicoopter to fly : Up and Sideways. There are no forward or reverse controls - the wind determines the direction. This helicopter is way too big for indoor use - helicopter can go 30 feet in less than 2 seconds and does not fair too well with accidents( they will happen ) landing gear especially. Don't know how to make it fo forward, I believe minor modifications will be necessary. A 4 ( or more ) channel helicopter will give you actual control of the helicopter, they start around $ 400. If you like modifing everything you buy, this a good project helicopter, I believe I can glue small plastic deflectors to the side which will propel it forward - you really don't need reverse - Otherwise, good power, for about 10 minutes, and very responsive to controls."
5,Excelent beginners helicopter,"This is a great helicopter for beginners, the only problem is that you fly it for about 10 or 15 minutes, and then u have to recharge it(takes like 3 hours, for a full charge)."
1,Yuck!,"I absolutely love technical writing books, and I hate this one! It is supposed to teach someone how to write a good user manual, but the book isn't written well! The author also tries too hard to use computer science analogies that are more annoying than useful.If for some reason you do read this book, skip the first half. There are a few good things in the latter half, but they are not specifically geared towards user manuals. They are general technical writing tips."
4,Possibly the best Inti Illimani album to date,"When I first came to Chile, the Inti-Illimani group was still in exile in Italy. Many years later, in the US, I found the Andadas album, and although I have since collected most of Inti- Illimani's other CDs, Andadas continues to be the favorite. The range of styles is pleasant and touches lightly upon the cultural diversity of Chile, but it does not dwell on lost causes and rough <<folk>> singing. However, the <<El Equipaje del Destierro>> track will grab the throat of anyone who has ever even felt like an exile (translations from the Spanish are on the liner notes). In <<Ella>> there is an excellent and funny lampoon of Mexican ranchero themes. ANDADAS would be an excellent introduction to Inti-Illimani and the contemporary popular music of Chile."
5,Great machine!!,"My family absolutely loves this machine. It has tons of different styles of workouts to do. I've had a long history of running, and this thing gets my heart rate going and gets me huffing a puffing. The only complaint that I have, is that it squeaks. We've tried a lot of different things to stop the squeaking, some days it doesn't squeak, and others it does."
5,Very entertaining and insightful.,I found this book to be very entertaining and insightful. Highly recommended for the potential mediators.
1,bowling basics a step-by-step approach,"I'm a bowling player since just two mounth but don't found in this book nothing usefully for my improving, I thing that a large part of the book it was wasted for tables useless repeated."
5,Parker & Bailey Kitchen Cabinet Creame,"I have used this product for many years, and it is excellent. I spring clean every year and you can see a difference in the cabinets. It goes on easy, wipes off easy, and smells good. Lives up to its reputation."
3,OK,"It was ok... but what can I say, I'm only in 8th grade, and the average 8th grader doesn't appreciate these boring civil war books... I didn't really care for it too too much.. (I got a B on the test) :-) :-) :-) :-) k, well, BYE!"
5,A Johnny Tremain proponant--that's me.,"My husband tells me I'm a real proponant of ""Johnny Tremain"" and he's right. ""Johnny Tremain"" was probably THE book that is responsible for my intense interest in history. I first read it as a child in school. The book is so alive that one can close one's eyes and be in pre-Revolutionary War Boston. I re-read Johnny every few years and still enjoy every word and still find something important in it.A word to students, if you are reading it for class and resent having to read it then you won't enjoy it, but if you think of it as an adventure story and if you want to find out how our country began this is a very good book to find out. Would you enjoy reading about a young boy on another planet fighting to save his world from being dominated by a race from another galaxy? It could almost be the same story.I think there are some books that are meant to be read throughout your life, ""The Secret Garden"" and ""A Tale of Two Cities"" are two and so is ""Johnny Tremain""."
4,This is a good book for mature readers.,"I bought this book for my 10 year old son to satisfy a summer reading requirement of a novel about the Colonial era. I tried very hard to get him to read it but when that didn't work I read it myself. I actually liked it quite a lot. But I understand why he won't be interested. There are a number of places where it gets very slow and only mature readers can get through it. We read ""Carry on Mr. Bowdicth"" aloud last year and he liked that very much. He seems eager to read it again instead of Johnny Tremain."
3,Johnny Tremain: A boys journey to manhood,"I read this book in school. It provides a lot of information about what causes the Revolutionary War, but does not explain much about what happens during the Revolutionary War. It shows a young boys (Johnny Tremain) journey through Boston as certain circumstances make him change courier paths. This story is okay. It is not that exciting but if you like history you will enjoy it."
3,Intresting but preferalbely hard to understand,I recomend this book for people who are 12 and older and like history i read this 269 page book in 7 days.
4,Johnny Tremain,"Johnny Tremain was one of the most exciting and adventurous books I have ever read. The story starts out slow, but then starts to progress. My favorite character in the book is Johnny Tremain because he reminds me a lot of myself. He is a boy about my age that I can relate to in many ways. The setting of the story is just before the Revolutionary War. Almost all of Johnny's actions and decisions are related to the setting. Johnny participates in the Boston Tea party which was a main factor in how the war started. I recommend this book for kids who are in sixth or seventh grade. The author's style was sometimes hard to understand, but you could still read the book. I give this book four stars and suggest that you go and buy it. I know you will love it as much as I did."
4,Note to Teachers and Parents,"I purchased this audio recording of Johnny Tremain for my classroom. It is the unabridged recording of the book and a great value for the price. The CDs track every three minutes, and Grace Conlin does a fine job narrating the story. My students have been able to follow along with the text while listening, and they can easily use the CDs on their own. Personally I much prefer George Guidall's narration (from Recorded [...]); I think that it is a more dynamic and enjoyable recording. However, if you are looking for a basic recording of Johnny Tremain and don't want to spend a fortune, these CDs certainly do the job."
1,made death seem welcome,i grabed this book wanting to read an intresting story full of twists and turns when i was done i felt like i had been beaten with a baseballbat. it drags on repeating what it has already stated. it contains nothing to set it apart from a normal piece of blank paper the only good thing i have to say or think about this book is that it makes GREAT tinder for any fireplace!!!
5,Johnny Tremain,I thought this book was great! I skipped a few lines because I was dying to know what had happened. I would suggest this book to anyone who is mature enough to like it.
3,A Bland American Classic,"Esther Forbes' Johnny Tremain is a rather bland book. The novel failed to keep me interested. I was simply not compelled to read on. The several minor conflicts throughout the story were not exciting enough to keep the reader on the edge. As an avid reader of historical fiction based on the Revolutionary War, I must say I was very disappointed by the dullness of this American classic."
4,Johnny Tremain,"Johnny Tremain is absolutely the best Revoulutionary War book ever. Johnny is a 14 year old silversmith apprentice, when his hand is maimed! What will he do?After a long search for a new job Johnny enters a new world with his friend Rab, a publisher of a rebel newspaper :The Boston Observer.In this new world,Johnny meets friends like John and Sam Adams, Paul Revere, and James Otis.He also met enemies like Merchant Lyte. Altogether with the turmoil with British officers, Johnny is caught in the middle of tragedy, exictment, and fear, as the Boston Tea Party, and the battles of Lexington and Concord happen. It is an excellent book which you won't want to miss."
2,A Mediocre Book,"Unlike most books, this one started out with pizzaz and was interesting from the very beginning. The end (or mostly the second half of this book) was dull, dumb, lifeless, boring, ambigous, and altogether a terrible read. I forced myself to finish it and found myself asleep with the book on the floor next to me quite often. If the beginning of this book wasn't so good I would give this book a one star rating, which it doesn't even deserve. For those looking for historical fiction wrapped in drama and excitement you won't find it here."
5,Fabulous Historical Fiction,"Johnny Tremain was a fantastic book. My kids and I enjoyed the book throughly, and we're very surprised by the bad reviews. The book was historically accurate, and make one feel as if they were there in Boston in the days leading up to the up American Revolution."
5,Loaded with information,"I bought it as a Christmas gift for my husband and it was his favorite gift! It really helps me connect the dots with what I'm reading in my bible. We framed ours, and it has a nice protective coating that i think a person could use a dry erase pen on it in a teaching situation. This family tree poster has so much information, I've not even begun to digest it all yet!"
4,"Dark, but quite good!","This movie is an offbeat, dark comedy, which brings to light the corrupt political climate of Northern Ireland and the presence of the IRA.David Thewlis plays his quirky character to the hilt and beatifully balances the seriousness of the IRA ex-con, Pat Keegan (Jason Isaacs).I loved this movie, with all of it's wit and humor. See it, I think you will be pleasantly surprised!"
1,Not a Good Movie at All,"David Thewlis, why did you accept such a sucky script? The crappy acting, poor timing, and superficial characters totally detract from any underlying political message. This movie's main character is a philandering idiot and nothing more. His wife is even less believable and likable. There is a gratuitously violent and totally outlandish scene in which the only good character in this film is defenestrated, but of course the idiot gets away. What happens to his mistress should have happened to the script, before this ever made it to production. I love independent films, I love David Thewlis' acting, but even after two years I still have a yucky taste in my mouth from this piece of poo called a movie. If you want more David Thewlis, see ""Seven Years in Tibet"" or ""Life is Sweet"", instead."
3,Not like the old tab books,"I bought this book hoping to get both the piano tabs and the guitar tabs complete. The piano part is complete and accurate, but the guitar tab part does not. There are almost no second guitars, and not even one riff to complete the songs. It's like a easy guitar version, and just for one guitar. Nevertheless the include guitar tabs sound very cool. I search all over the web for a good tab for optimistic and could'nt finf it. This one sounds great. I hope the amnesiac book will be better."
4,"Looks nice, and tough enough too","I like my phone to look different and ring different from other phones. This Bermuda Blue is a very nice color, and actually has a range of colors in it, the plastic underneath is almost purple. It's my favorite color. I've just recently got my second 5100-series phone now, and I've had this faceplate both times. The first one held up well, considering phones tend to take a lot of abuse from me. A few dings did not detract from the look of this product."
3,The Mary Chain (in the style of Billy Idol),"Automatic is probably the last Mary Chain album to put on your shopping list- you certainly shouldn't even think of getting it unless you already have Psychocandy, Darklands, or Stoned and Dethroned. A fairly predictable set of brainless rock'n'roll cliches set to drum machines, it sounds very much like the band were trying to break into the American market at the time by sugar-coating their gloomy alternative-rock. The result is a far more palatable album than either Psychocandy or Darklands, but a markedly inferior one- it sounds like Primal Scream and Billy Idol collaborating on a film soundtrack from the early 90s. Although its a fun listen, its rather formulaic and samey- most of the tracks blend into each other by the end. As such, its far from an essential purchase."
2,Overproduced....score another victory for the suits.,"Compared to all other J&MC albums, this one stands out as the most banal and 2-dimensional.This album was produced by suits. End of story.There is no question that a reasonable album was cut in the studio and a bunch of remix jockeys massaged it into something that pandered to the lowest common denominator. Psychocandy had none of that and was a large commerical success - why the label decided that could not be replicated, I could not tell you.Muscially there are some very interesting elements in this work, but they have had all the rough edges sanded down. If you are looking for J&MC albums that are creative and push the edges of music, listen to Psychocandy and Munki.While I *do* enjoy listening to this album, keep in mind it is J&MC work in an ""Elevator Music"" warpper.Annoying and dissappointing."
1,Book,"Never received the book. Book shows as being delivered, but does not show where it delivered to and who signed for the book."
5,Fundamental is why QBQ! works!,"If only this fundamental and powerful message of personal responsibility was taken seriously by our world, we can only imagine what it would be like to live in a world like that! This book is fantastic! QBQ! showed me exactly HOW TO practicing personal accountbility by asking better questions of myself. I heard the author on the Dave Ramsey show and he is dynamic and the content is practical. I've already read QBQ! 3 times in 3 days and I will ""return to the well"" every time I feel myself about to blame, whine, procrastinate and point fingers. Personal accountability, as the author points out, is the better path! Fun read."
4,a good quick read,"this was a good book to read(listen) to in the car. brought some good points to light, a good one to get from the library b/c its quick, but i highly suggest it regardless"
3,"Personal Acountability ""Daily Sayings""","I started to read this book and could not really get into it. It was more like, ""So where is the meaty stuff"". I thought that I might as well finish the book. It wasn't a big one anyhow. ""Man, what a simple silly book"".I don't remember which chapter it was but about halfway through I started to HEAR the transformation. My language and attitude became much more sensitive and positive. I actually began to realize how negative I was speaking.This little book is really quite deceiving in how powerful it is.!! I will probably use it to open meetings by reading selected chapters ( average of 2 pages)not for motivation as much as for introspective personal evaluation. After all, as the author said we can only change ourselves!I cannot stress enough how much can be accomplished through the simplicity of this book."
1,Author spoke at our annual meeting,As such I decided to read one of his books that was in the library. Yawn! Didnt think it was very good. The reason I cant recommend it is that it speaks about the obvious in responsibility. I mean if you dont know the obvious how would you get a job at a corporation in the first place? That is my opinion
5,Best Book Ever!!!,"This is the best book that I have ever read for both business and personal life. After reading the book, I had to read ""Flipping the Switch"" also....just as great as QBQ. I have made this required reading for all the front line supervisors where I work. Everyone that has read it so far agrees ""Best Book Ever"". Once you read it, you will have to recommened to everyone that you know. I even contacted a consultant who does teambuilding, soft skills, etc. training and told her she needs to add this to her recommended reading list on her website. Read the book and you will see what I am talking about. Good Reading to you!!"
5,Applicable for All Ages,"I am a junior in college and absolutly love John Miller's book. Although he is mainly in the corporate world, I found his material to be very pertinent to my life as a college student. We students, like most people, find many different people to blame for our problems! Thanks John for your insight! I am less stressed when I stop blaming others and start taking responsibility and asking, ""What can I do?"""
3,Short read with some good content,"Nothing great, but a few good behavior reminders. Worth the time if digging into what's behind what people are really asking isn't a current habit."
3,Worth reading but,Agatha Christie is of course a wonderful writer. But not being fond of such murder and investigation stories I read this book just to learn about her style.
4,Iconic Whodunit,"This terrific mystery novel from 1934 defines the whodunit genre. For me, Christie builds on Doyle's Sherlock Holmes novels by introducing the culture and mores of the twentieth century, including nagging doubts about our own ability to discern right from wrong. Although one knows that Poirot, like Holmes, will crack the case, Poirot's flaws (vanity, unimposing stature, and lack of power to bring anyone to real justice) introduce some dramatic suspense. In addition, Christie uses the genre to explore the culture, manners, class tensions, and national rivalries of the day.The twist of this whodunit is remarkably clever and ties in well with some of the disillusionment of twentieth century man with the ability to tell right from wrong and with the limits of rationality. There is a wonderful irony to all this given Poirot's Holmes-like belief in reason.The novel is dated but reads very well. Great fun as well as containing literary merit."
5,Exactly what I was looking for,"This version, as read by David Suchet, was amazing. He does all the voices with expertise and I greatly enjoyed the rendition. It sounds more like a radio drama than a simple reading."
3,Murder on the Orient Express,"The book is a bit dated, but the story line is still interesting. It makes a good read for bedtime and lazy afternoons."
3,An entrapping story. You will enjoy it!,"The famous Belgian detective Hercule Poirot takes the train from Istanbul to Paris not knowing that a brutal crime would take place on that express. Mr. Bouc, the owner of the Wagon Company, asks his old friend Mr. Poirot to be in charge of the investigation of this murder. So Poirot becomes the one who seeks for the cruel assassin. All the passengers are interrogated by Poirot. Searching for the truth, Poirot finds a variety of evidence that point to each one of the passengers. Poirot sits for a while to meditate and think deeply about the evidence, which shows us the brilliance of his searching. Also you will enjoy the diversity of personalities found in the Orient Express. How this murder occurs is a mystery that can only be revealed at the end of the book. So you will be entrapped by the story till the end."
5,Pocanhontas,I order this for my grand daughter for Christmas her mother had it on VHS. I enjoyed watching this waith my girls. this DVD was in excellent condition.
5,nice,"I like that they are packaging these movies on a single disc for a lower price, i have two little girls and they can't get enough of disney"
4,red face plate,this cell phone face plate is rally cute since i like red. i rated it a 4.that is my review.
2,This is for really little kids!,"This was so disappointing. We had been giving our grandchildren National Geographic for Kids which costs $15 for a year and this was $27.00 and only 6 little booklets. I guess I didn't notice the ""little"" in the title and I'm not sure the every other month was made clear."
5,Loved It!,My Granddaughter first of all loved getting something in the mail addressed to HER! She loves animals and she is curious like most children and this fills the bill.
5,National geographic for little kids.,"as it went to my great Grandaughters and my grandson had it when he was young I know they will enjoy the baby animal pictures as he did,"
3,For 2-3 year olds; too many self-promotions/ads for itself,"This isn't bad but it's awful slim for the price. Also, the content is excessively simple and really only engaging for a two year old, maybe 3. For book smart kids 3 and 4, this is way too baby.It doesn't have ads from third parties, but this thing is overrun with advertisements for itself, for subscriptions, and with those annoying cards stuck in the pages. Needless to say, this adds nothing for the kids."
2,Promising failure,"2 1/2None too shady metal, sprinkled with healthy doses of symphonic and progressive influences, over a bed of sufficient instrumental diversity, nonetheless falls prey to overcocked vocalizations strapped around too many generically apathetic passages."
2,surebonder 5900,"I purchased this product because it is capable of using brads and pins as well as staples. However, brads and pins are no where to be found and the company that shipped the item (Northern Tool) does not respond to my inquiries. Needless to say I am dissatisfied."
5,"Proud,Loud and Punk",This is the greatest complex that i have ever heard its the best for someone who doesnt have any english oi albums.
2,Be careful,"I don't like this brand. It is good enough for running but the front wheel wasn't working well and I have gone through three wheels already because their customer service twice sent me the wrong one. The last one is still not good enough. If I had to buy a stroller I wouldn't buy this brand, I am not completely happy with it. For this price it should work perfectly right from the start and it doesn't."
1,what ??????,"what cd were you people listening to, this is one of the worst albums yet. i have been listening to them for many years. i love the melvins, but really when are they gonna put out a serious album again. like ozma or gluey. get one of those or bullhead or lysol."
5,Do you have a Mullet and a Modern 2001 camaro?,"Get ready to rock! If you own all the albums, or are just getting into the Melvins, you will quickly see that the Melvins continue to bestow upon you gobs and gobs of coolness. This album pushes their style forward and while exmphasizing their excellent production skills. This album is modern, yet rocks you to true lower E angst style as only the Melvins can do."
2,Not impressed,"A picture of the whole plant would be more helpful. To me, it's not very large. I wouldn't have paid the price if I'd known how big it really was, but it works."
1,I don' understand what this film means ...,"Since I don't want to criticize this film, I'll just describe my experience. I watched this film with high expectations.Because I like Keanu Reeves. But when the film went to the end , I thought this film did not have a trick or a surprising soryline yet. Expecting a surprising trick, I watched to the end . Nothing happened! I was disappointed and went home."
3,Keanu a believable killer,"Dark sometimes slow but I love Keanu in this movie. Very good Character, dark and broody the way I like my killers. I think he did a excellent job with the script he was given. Give the acting a 4 but the script a 2. Still liked it enough to make it into my collection."
4,"Not the best of movies, but A for effort!","I went into the theater expecting to see a total clunker. But I was pleasantly surprised. Not by the movie on a whole, but the individual performances were pretty damn good.My instant reactions to the commercials were: Keanu Reeves and James Spader in a movie? Keanu playing a bad guy? I am *so* there! And I'll tell you, although the movie is not fast moving, and not that action packed, it was quite enthralling.The commercials dressed the movie up as Keanu's character, Griffin, stalking his victims for awhile...maybe dating them, and then murdering them. But in the movie, it is not that way at all. Must less intimate you'll find, his real reason for killing is for the attention it brings him of Spader's F.B.I. agent, Campbell. His true obsession is not with murdering, but with the one trying to arrest him.Good performances from Reeves, and as always, with the consistently excellent Spader. I really enjoyed the interaction between the two actors."
1,Save your Money,I am a man of few words.....this is a worthless piece of trite tripe. Once again Keanu Reeves proves he has the acting ability of a pear. This is a hackneyed plot....another serial killer pseudosuspense. Nowhere near the quality of Sea of Love.
3,Okay.,"I watched this movie and it was okay.The plot needed a little work but its okay.Keanu Reeves does a good job playing the killer that stalks these women.I recommend that you see this movie,but don't think this movie will have the best plot in the world,but this is a decent movie."
2,READ THIS BEFORE YOU BUY,"when i first saw the trailer for this film i thought it looked pretty good, how wrong i was , it was sad to see James Spader playing such a flat and 2 dimensional role as the detective, and to top it all Keanu Reeves a villain , i think not, hes a good hero but thats his limits stick to what your good at. So it gets 2 stars because of the dismal storyline and the disappointing ending which seals the films fate."
3,"decent mid level 3/8"" overlay hinge","A decent quality mid level 3/8"" overlay hinge. What more can be said, it does what it should do. The $8.95 shipping from Woodworkers Hardware is garenteeed to leave a sour taste in your mouth though. Even more so when you figure out that Woodworkers Hardware only charges $6.95 shipping when you order directly from them..."
5,Still a champ,"The Sand Pebbles could have been written this year, intended to be another cautionary parable about getting involved in land wars in Asia (and elsewhere) rather than the historical fiction that it is. The author, Richard McKenna, was a China sailor in the 1930s and his experience shows in the rich authenticating detail that colors (but never obscures) the story.The book was soon followed by a movie, also calledThe Sand Pebbles, and both are remarkable. China in 1926 is certainly alien and complicated. The book is filled with hard to forget characters: the complex Chinese, the sometimes childish crew of the USS San Pablo, and the too-good-for-their-own-good American missionaries.The Sand Pebbles has been around for nearly 50 years. But that's no reason to pass it by--or to skip the movie. The film is remarkably true to the book and both are very satisfying."
3,"Kindle version, by Rosetta books, is poorly presented","Richard McKenna's novel is not the reason for only 3 stars. The Kindle version of this novel is prepared by Rosetta books and their work is shabby at best. The text (no matter what type size I selected) is not left or right justified, there are numerous words misspelled (again not the author's problem). The text has instances of a correctly spelled word that clearly does not belong -- for example 'than', rather than 'then'. This is the first Kindle edition that I have encountered with these formatting / presentation / conversion to electronic edition issues. Don't buy the Rosetta edition for Kindle."
4,Perseverance,"Story of a guy who would not quit even though the consequences were overwhelming. The book has a special significance to me because I spend much time on the beautiful Isla of Margarita, Venezuela where the author settled in his final years. There are several of his many offspring who live on the island."
2,This is no _Beautiful Thing_!,"Johan is cute. That's all this movie has going for it. There is NO communication between the two lead men, and all the conversations between Johan and his boyfriend are in a foreign language. (With no subtitles!) The only dialog is between the English man and his girlfriend, and even that is hard to understand because it is drowned out by the accompanying music. There are a couple of sexy scenes, but if you're looking for a sensual, romantic movie, look somewhere else."
5,Every teen should read and will love Patricia,"I read this as a teen and today, I still love the story. It is a timeless and poignant story of ""doing the right thing"". I cry every time. It is a story that every dream should be. I highly reccommend it for Christians looking for a true romance to read."
5,Nine O'Clock in the Morning,"I read Nine O'Clock in the Morning years ago and it changed my life, now all these years later I needed to reread it and was so glad it was still in print...this book was the beging of my desire for more of Holy Spirit I loaded it to a friend and it touched her heart soooooo much.. the anointing is still on this book.."
3,Wow... just wow.,"I bought this movie because I love Ellen Page. I wasn't disappointed, but I wasn't happy. I did laugh through some of the movie, but it isn't a comedy. I just kept watching one scene over and over, and it doesn't even have Ellen in it. This movie didn't really demonstrate to me how well she can act. If anything it made me feel I should stop watching her films.If you like abstract films you might like this, I'm not really sure. I was lucky this film had that scene or I'd be very angry that I wasted over 30 bucks. I was on the floor laughing; it was so randomly placed in this film. You may have to watch the whole movie to understand why it was so funny.It's when they decide to leave; I don't want to give it away."
2,Way too big,"I wasn't sure if this was a woman's or man's fleece, but normally a woman's M is a little too snug on me, but this M was too big. If you're a woman, order a size or two smaller!"
4,Great quality and value,I bought this as a present for my brother. I had been looking all over for this exact product in all the stores I went to. This was the only place I could find it in the right color and size. I was also extremely pleased with the service and the fast delivery time.
1,31 Dollars? When you could just buy an ABBA album instead?,"That's what I don't get. Yes, their Swedish. But just a few extra tracks shouldn't cost THAT much. And these are found on a lot of ABBA's albums, including Gold, their greatest hits collection. These people should appear on every ABBA tribute album."
3,Bridge classic but perhaps a bit dated.,"This is a well-written and enjoyble classic from one of Britain's premier players of the early 20th century. He offers many excellent ideas on how you can change your general approach to bidding and play to improve your game. Very little on specific techniques.I'm a solid ""B"" player--competitive at the local level but not so much at regionals or sectionals. Over-all, I was hoping to get more from this book than I did."
4,The up-side of our country:,"Regardless of how disenchanted one might become with its politics, its politicians, or its policies, a film like this restores one's faith in what our country has to offer its young people. Even if you happen to think the sort of ruthless competition that goes on in this film is another strike against us as a country, there's still something very moving about a child being nationally recognized and celebrated for the size of her vocabulary rather than her socio-economic background, social skills, or appearance. In a place saturated by the influence of beautiful people (valued often for nothing else), its refreshing to see the child with the braces and the bad haircut hold up a trophy that comes up to his chest, and walk away with enough money to see him through his first year of college.Beyond that, this movie is delightfully nerve-wracking! Suspenseful and full of surprises, its as entertaining as it is important."
3,Rigged contest,"The makers of ""Spellbound"" start with a can't-miss formula-the buildup to a national spelling competition-and use it to explore some classic archetypes of American culture. There are the striving immigrants, the rich kid, the poor kids, the borderline-autistic kids, etc. It's fascinating, but a bit too pat at the same time. Editing choices make the director's allegiances clear and manipulate the viewer's emotions. ""Spellbound"" reminded me a lot of a recent cable documentary on child beauty pageants--the director used the medium to cast judgment on parents and indict American values at the same time, probably from the comfortable vantage point of S.F. or the Upper West Side. When are documentary filmmakers going to focus their energy on genuine muckraking instead of slinging mud at hapless middle-class folk? It's not like there aren't a lot of real miscarriages of justice out there. Poor Neil's hours with word lists just don't rank up there in my pantheon of atrocities."
4,H-I-G-H-larious,"This is the most unintentionally funny, stereotype proving movie I've ever seen. From the plantation owners talking about how ""not all the Mexicans is lazy- there's some good ones in the bunch"" to the teacher saying how excited she gets ""when I get a kid from India in my class"" because she knows ""they're always the hardest workers,"" this movie flings stereotypes all over the board. Oh, and let's not forget the one black contestant whose mother speaks in ebonics-style english and whose father is neither present nor mentioned.I feel bad for the kids and parents portrayed in this movie, because while you feel their anticipation and nervousness throughout the movie, you feel at the end, like Emily, that you are ""so happy I never have to do this again!"""
5,One of the best salsa singers.,"I believe he is one of the few Latin Artists, who in spite of his life, has gone through so much......his music is a mix of soft vocals plus some really hot salsa beats. I recommend this to anybody who believes love and salsa are the best mix."
5,Great for value(Hd -DVD),"Now the picture and sound is awesome, I mean that what is expected with a new generation of DVD correct. The best part is the value $499.99 for early adapters is awesome compared to the competition blue ray which is $999.99. The only difference is blue ray hold more data for an extra $500.00. If you own an Xbox 360 and can wait another 6 months there is an HD DVD add on that will cost about $150.00 - $200.00 so that good two. The disk holds about 30 gig 45 max so there will soon be the entire Star Wars trilogy on just one disk! Awesome! Now the HD DVD can do 1080i blue ray can do 1080p, which is like grapes, to grape juice there is no real difference at all. If you are used to looking at HD pictures you know what I mean. There is a lot of hype behind the two formats but I think HD DVD is the best way to go for cost and brand honesty."
4,"EXTRAORDINARY build quality, but not the best software.","This player really is a wonder for the price I got it at ($400 + a $75 dollar gift certificate came with it). It's got the best build quality of any disc player I've ever owned. ROCK SOLID. Weighs a ton. I saw the ""upgrade"" HD-A2, and it's a shoddily built piece of crap by comparison. Buy the HD-A1 while you still can! But beware, it's a bit picky about DVDs and CDs; plays HD-DVDs beatifully period though, and that's what its real purpose is."
3,Probably works,"I'm sure this bottle works fine, however..it will not work at all for an aquarium habitat. It needs a wire cage to hang on to"
4,"Great Muddy, Late Period","This is a very good collection of Muddy tunes, probably recorded in the late 70's. There is not much in the way of liner notes here, but I'd say you've got Bob Margolin and Luther Tucker on guitars, Jerry Portnoy on harp, and Pinetop Perkins on piano. The couple of tunes that Dizzy Gillespie sits in on are interesting, but not the main draw. The guitars are soft in the mix when it comes to soloing, but since both guitar players are shrinking violet types, I'm not surprised.If you're a true Muddy fan, you'll want to pick this up. It's an excellent collection of tunes, with a good upbeat feel. Special favorites include DONE BROKE DOWN, BABY ROCK AND ROLL (aka The Blues Had a Baby and They Named It Rock and Roll), and KANSAS CITY."
2,Buy only 2,I liked Billy Madason and Happy Gilmore a lot. One of my favorite movies. Bulletproof was not that good of a movie. Ypu are better off by getting Billy Madason and Happy Gillmore sepritly.
1,Don't waste your time,"If you like really bad student films, this is your movie. You'll realize it within 15 minutes... Let me save you those 15 minutes, watch something else."
3,movie review,the starts out very slow and continues that way until about 4 minutes from the end and as it finishes--------- then!
5,Amazing,"I've never heard from this group,but my neigbour has visit The Dominicaanse Republiek and bring some records from the group to Belgium,she said to me Paul I've got really good stuff on cd and so she give me the records and I listen to the cd's and it was all swing fun & pleasure and a good quality sound on it,so I got to search on Amazon because I don't want no copy but as a collector I want an original cd in my collection.Now by the time was gone I recieved my first record of Los Hèrmanos Rosario and it is an amazing cd beautiful music and a great sound,there was only one minus plus the lyrics wasn't not in english so I can't read the liner notes and that's bad.But it's still a very good item for my collectionThank to the sender for the quick delivery right on time & the good quality for the product.Perhaps till the next timeThank you very muchPaul music collector from Belgium"
2,"Made out of plastic, not clay.","I'm not sure as to what I didn't understand about the product description, but the pot (and matching tray) I purchased are made out of plastic. They look okay I suppose, but I was really disappointed in the quality of the product. I thought it was going to be made out of clay. They need to put in the description that it's made out of plastic. I don't know why it says ""clay"" in the description, very misleading."
3,Batteries Should last longer than a few days...,"I like this product a lot, it's small, the clarity is great, however, the batteries have been replaced twice and I've only had them for 1 month."
3,uniden gmr1035-2,"Bought these a couple of years ago refurbished directly from UNIDEN. They work great for my intended purpose which was to give to my kids so I can monitor them while they are out in the neighborhood. Works great 2 or 3 streets over, batteries last 10-14 days of everyday use at ~2-3 hours a day."
4,whitetrash,these guys are rad. I saw them open for guttermouth a few years ago any they were hella rad they kick saw dust on everyone. The cd is rad as [heck] to funny and fast its a good buy i say. best band from san diego (well santee) in a long time!!!
4,Explosive,After getting a front row seat in a jam-packed theater one night in July of 1996 was one thing but to see amazingly shattering effects wipe out half the world was another. No doubt the star here are the Oscar-winning effects. It was a blast to see for the first time but even the shine on this one wears away with each viewing. Some parts of the story sound totally oddball but carry the film just enough to hold our interest. I loved it. Being a fan of the sci-fi films of the 1950's helps a lot...
4,THE ONLY BEST OF Will Smith,"In a way this movie reminds me of another great movie ""Armageddon"". Both has the same thrill and suspense not to forget the amazing computer effects.I am not a big fan of Will Smith but I must admit that I see he did a great job... especially for giving a light sense of humor to the movie.Of course this movie wouldn't have been successful without its rich effects. And this DVD wouldn't have been rich without its extras!"
3,Its an okay summer movie to rent,"Independence Day is a simple plotted movie, in which aliens try to take over the world. The lead star is Will Smith who is a fighter pilot who fights and eventually destoys the alien mother ship. The special effects are awesome in this movie, particularly the fighter combat sequences. But like many new sci-fi movies this one lacks good acting and story line. The actor who plays the president is disgusting. His character in my opinion is so wimpy and uhhhh it makes me cringe watching some of the scenes where they try to create a plot. Particularly where the president's wife dies. You really have to see this scene yourself, but it is so fake. This movie could have been so much better if the director would have put more money and effort into developing a more complex plot, with better actors other then Will Smith; who is awesome in this film. Overall, this movie is okay if your a scifi freak, but other then the action it is not that good and not really worth buying."
3,"Great DVD set, okay movie.","The movie was dumb fun back in theatres, and I never gave it much thought afterwards. But seeing the special edition dual-disc DVD in the store made me jump at it. Most DVDs list widescreen and the trailer as their ""extras."" This one has a separate disc dedicated to them, and its chock full of neat stuff. I really liked having the choice between the theatrical and special edition(kind of like the Poison Ivy DVD where you could choose between R-rated and Unrated versions before viewing). The menus are animated with certain adapted scenes and audio clips from the movie, not just some single image like most DVDs. While the movie's not great(we all know that), it's still a good purchase to exploit the digital format."
2,Blu Ray missing bang,"This is a great movie but how can the DVD special ed have more content then a 30GB Blu ray disc. This blu ray is lacking the behind the action content, it is lacking the directors cuts. Save your money and get the DVD 2 disc instead of this quick buck pacakge by Fox."
3,not bad but...,The scene where Will Smith and his partner Jimmy get chased by alien space craft...there were 2 alien ships chasing them...what happened to the other? When Jimmy gets killed in his fighter jet the other alien ship just decides to fall back and stop chasing Will Smith??? give me a break!! There should have been 2 alien ships chasing Smith not 1...so there's a discontinuity issue there.
2,A Disapointment,"This movie, for me, was a disapointment. Good special effects, yes, but that only goes so far. This was also some sort of send-up of sci-fi movies of the past, but they played it so straight-faced the actors come off looking more like cliches than anything else. The dialogue was laughable and you knew what was going to happen before it did. ""Mars Attacks"" is a way better movie to me because they went all the way with the camp humor and sci-fi references and it came out as it should be: a lot of fun. This movie tried that, but it also tried to be dramatic at the same time, so it failed at both."
1,DVD doesn't work in Toshiba 3108!!!,I just bought this DVD and I have since found out that it will not play in a toshiba 3108 dvd player what a huge dissapointment!
3,Disappointed content and print,"I have the the dvd release and it has way better cover prints, the blu ray cover prints are so bad its like it printed off a blur image using ink jet printers, and the blu ray does not contains the deleted scenes included in the dvd release, really disappointed .....i'm giving away my copy to my nephew...."
3,Not bad.,This is kinda like Men in Black but a little different. This is a show about aleins coming to take over the world. Just your classic alein takeover. I used to have it but it got cut and scratched and we had to throw it away. It is a good: Time KIller.
4,Great special effects and a bit of suspense,"While there may be a plot hole here and there, this is an enjoyable film that will not leave you hanging at the end. A worthy addition for the discriminating sci-fi aficionado."
5,Independance day,"Everything the explosions, the flights , the aliens looked so much more brilliant and clear in bluray. The sound was so clear like being at the theater."
4,good movie,this movie is old enough that its a great one to get on blu-ray even if you have the standard dvd
1,"BAD, VERY BAD","This movie was not made for artistic purposes thats for sure. It is just really bad. The effects are tiresome, the dialogue is uninspired, there is too much humour and why does AMERICA have to win all the time? No offence. It's just a little up setting."
3,United We Stand,"The first time I watched this movie was back in 1997-1998. My first thought was, ""wow what a good movie!"" All the explosion and the excitement makes this movie even more captivating. Will Smith did o.k. in this movie however I feel there was a lack of acting/ effort put out from this man. There was a lot of potentials. A quarter through the movie was interesting because viewers wonder what the humans will do to save themselves from alien destruction. From half way to the end of the movie, it was mostly humans vs. aliens, good vs. bad. All the major countries come together as allies to fight terror from out of space. It gave you a nice feeling of patriotism, not for one's country but for mankind. I wouldn't say this is the best Will Smith film, but it's a fun film to check out."
2,I've got a cold!,Fun visuals. One star. Fun sound. One star. I can barely get a Mac to talk to a PC. We beat the aliens by using a computer virus? Uh huh. Why not give them a human virus? It would work as well.
3,Eye Candy,OK here's my take on this movie. When you watch it you have to realize that this a movie meant for entertainment value not quality cinema. One can see just from the previews that it was full of cheesy dialogue and countless plot holes. Yet when i see a movie like this i try to avoid thinking about those because this movie is meant soley to entertain. And at that i feel it excels greatly. It is full of great special effects and some nice action sequences and of course really big explosions. I feel that when you watch a movie you have to put it in its genre and rate it accordingly. Therefore you can not expect much from a movie like ID4. And above all this was a kids movie so of course the directors could do things like have plot holes because they knew there target audience wouldnt mind because they would be too caught up in the special effects. I say it did what it was meant to do. but if youre looking for a GOOD science fiction movie pass on this one and rent the original star wars or V
1,Review of the Blu-ray - NOT the movie.,"The film is probably the ultimate ""B"" Sci-Fi movie of all time. Growing up in the 60s I watched its predecessors from the 50s with endless enthusiasm (and still appreciate them). So, despite its ""flaws"" I love the movie.The Blu-ray edition of the movie is a different story. The promise of the Blu-ray medium is betrayed in this release since it includes only the regular theatrical release and NOT the extended version that is available on DVD or any other goodies. Why on earth NOT have both versions on the 50GB BR disc?Worse still is that finding this out - for me at least - was at the cost of buying the Blu-ray version.The film does look great on Blu-ray but since I have to keep my 2 disc DVD edition to have both versions I won't be able to streamline my collection and I'm not happy about that."
4,ALIENS HAVE NEVER LOOKED THIS GOOD,"With the talents of Will Smith, Bill Pullman, and many others, who can ask why this movie was such a big hit. Here's the story: an alien fleet arrives, destroys a whole lot of stuff, then...... You'll have to watch the move to find out. Brilliant special effects, an outstanding cast, Independence Day is a movie the whole family will enjoy."
5,Independence Day,"This is one of my absolute favorite movies. I wish i could purchase it so i can stream it whenever i want instead of having to rent it. Must say, though, the rental rate is definitely reasonable."
4,ID4,"One of my favorite summer movies of all time, enjoyed it even more on blu ray. Great picture & sound. Paying extra for it sure worth it. There is no shame in recommending it!"
1,Worst movie in Hollywood history... Bar none.,"How this movie merited a special edition is beyond my understanding. I can't even describe how bad this movie is, so I won't even try. Watch it and judge it by yourself. Who knows, maybe some folks enjoy this kind of slop. They must... it made money."
2,"Just 'cus it's ""only a movie"" doesn't mean it has to stink","forgive me if I'm wrong, but Raiders of the Lost Ark, Die Hard, Terminator, etc. were just fun action movies, but they were good."
3,Worth it for the pyrotechnics,"A lot of this movie is lame and preachy and 'America rules', but it's honestly worth the fee of renting this movie just to see LA and Washington DC and New York blown away in an awesome special effects spectacele that put Day After Tomorrow to shame years before it's time."
3,Watch with lowered expectations,"I don't mind this film so much but what nearly ruined it for me was Will Smith. His constant asinine comments throughout the film. He finds an alien, punches him once, says 'welcome to Earth' and then has a cigar? Are you kidding? And he has these kinds of scenes throughout the film. It makes an otherwise entertaining film kinda disappointing. And the ending is, of course, ridiculous. Even the tv mini-series V had a more realistic approach to dealing with the aliens than this film.So, if you have a rainy day, want to just veg out on the couch and let your mind take a break from thinking, this film is for you."
1,Absolute Refuse,"I can suspend disbelief. I can put pretension and artistic concerns aside and simply enjoy a movie for sheer entertainment value. I cannot condone or recommend this humongous pile of dung that millions of tastless morons have actually claimed to enjoy. Acting: horrible. Plot: embarrasing Effects: whoopee, the White House just exploded, big deal. If I want to see two hours of explosions I'll set off M-80's in my backyard. Oh my god look Randy Quaid is a crop duster turned state of the art multimillion dollar jet fighter pilot and just saved the world! Wow! Will Smith somehow knows how to pilot an alien spacecraft! And his stripper girlfriend still has to go to work even though the ""mother ship"" is floating over L.A. Give the girl a break geez! Give ME a break."
2,only 1 problem.,"This movie is a really great movie. I think it would be an easy classic, if not for one problem: Will Smith. If he would not have been in this moive, with all his not-funny jokes and cockiness, thise could have easily been the greatest scifi movie of the 90s. I really love this movie, and might be one of my favorites, if there had been a more serious actor in playing that part."
1,Dreadful,"Just another tediously boring ""America saves the planet while the rest of the world stands around doing nothing"" film. Yawn."
3,A 3.5 star Sci Fi Movie.,"In a nut shell the movie was good, not bad, but not spectacular ether. I like the SPECIAL EFFECTS and Aliens. The movie is a kind of WAR OF THE WORLDS meets TOP GUN (for those who have not seen it) buy it for your sci fi collection, but don't pay too much. Enjoy"
3,Entertaining,"Will Smith is tons of fun in this movie along with Jeff Goldblum. The movie isn't art or literature, but it's a fun ride. Of course, in the wake of 9/11 and the crises we are facing these days, I think it loses a lot of its punch. This movie was made back in the day when such things were only imaginary."
4,Just a fun movie...,Every movie doesn't have to be an Oscar contender. Sometimes it's nice just to sit down and watch a fun movie. ID4 fits the bill. Just watch and enjoy.
1,A huge disappointment,"After all the advertising hype about this movie, I was very excited to see it. But from the first scene to the last, it was laughable instead of being serious. The worst drivel in the movie was the speech by the president to the pilots near the end. The characters themselves were so underdeveloped that no one cared that they were about to perish. And give me a break - if the first lady was dying, doctors would do more for her than placing a little oxygen on her and saying ""there's nothing we can do."""
1,Pure uninspired trash,This is probably the worst science fiction film ever shown at a theater. I rented it when it first came out on video to give it a second chance. It was even worse the second time. The only good thing about Independence Day is the always reliable Jeff Goldblum.
4,Just have fun watching it,"Simply put, it is an entertaining movie to watch for its special effects, its comic relief and enjoyable storyline fantasy."
5,INDEPENDENCE DAY,"I am a big fan of this kind of movie.It was a thrill ride for me from start to finish.Roland Emmerich is a fine director who brought us GODZILLA and THE PATRIOT.With a steller cast,award winning special effects,this film is a must have,and a must see family favorite for many years to come.I highly recommend it along with other sci-fi classics."
4,Cheesy at times but great special effects,"OK, so who believes anyone could actually download (from a laptop) a virus into a VASTLY superior computer system and defeat the enemy? That's what I thought. Seriously, this movie had it's great moments also. The special effects. Very good and great to hear loud!!"
2,Tremendous disappointment!,"If you read Leonard Maltin's review you'll have the whole movie in a nutshell.As a Star Trek Next Generation fan I was hoping for a film of similar quality, excitement and depth. No such luck."
3,A very cool homage to the 1950s,"flying saucer/earth invaded flicks. Special effects are very good, but, as most others have said, don't look too deeply beyond them for a substantial script. Just watch and enjoy without thinking too much."
5,A Wonderful Ride,"What a great collection of stories. Ms. Denison has done it again! I enjoyed her novel ""Stella's Search"" and I thoroughly enjoyed this book too.""Ship of Secrets"" is a great tale of adventure and mystery. I was intrigued from the first page. Everyone, it seems, has a secret. Don't you?The other stories contained in the book were equally intriguing. My personal favorite tells the story of a Grandmother who plans an armored car heist. A fun and entertaining adventure.Buy this book - you won't be sorry!"
3,Pleased,Thank you for everything. This book came in a very timely fashion and we are so happy. We could not get it anywhere else. Your new and used products are very good. There is hardly any confusion or problems with your website either. I appreciate it. Your products are aiding my son and husband in furthering their educations. Bless you all.
5,fantastic short stories,"Claire Keegan is a new find for me and I love her work. I had to put down the book for a couple of days after reading the opening and title story, ""Antarctica."" I was simply stunned by the way it wrapped up, though I started getting a sense about where it could be going, but it went way further than I anticipated. Keegan seems to be a writer somewhat in the O. Henry style who can wrap up with a perfectly plausible, though wholly unexpected resolution. Emily Dickinson described poetry as something that should blow your head off, and these short stories will did just that to me."
3,Not complete enough !,The Reti lines are well covered but against the KI the lines recomended doesn't seem right. Black seems to be better.Besides the book does not cover lines where black replies 1.~c5. `1.~d6 and 1.~g6.
3,Best lock for gym lockers but don't get it wet.,Best lock for gym lockers but don't get it wet. Mine got wet and the dials became harder to turn. Had to get a new one but keeps your mind at peace knowing bolt cutters cannot cut it.
2,Disappointed,"I read Peter's ""A walk across America"", which was actually a walk to the Gulf. It was a very good book and for the most part inspirational. Those kinds of trips are tough because you are out in the elements and need the help of others. Peter connects this help with God, which is a little bit goofy but it is not overplayed. In this book Barbara is by far the better writer; however, there is way too much religion in this book. If you are not a Christian you will be turned off with the bent this book gives on every event. At the end of each chapter there is an excerpt from the Bible. There is no doubt many wonderful generous Americans in the United States but to think God is in play there is a bit neurotic."
5,Mmmmm!,"I love this syrup! It is so buttery! It is my favorite. However, I think that the price of the product added to the price for shipping is too expensive. I thought I would get a bargain for buying bulk, but in the future will take the trek to the store."
4,I want an entire album of Zebra,"Eclectic is the word to describe this CD. Each song is so different from the other.If I had my wish, I'ld like to hear an entire CD of tracks with the sound of Zebra. What a great bluesy, bopping, tune!"
2,Doesn't stay put on car window,I got this to put my EZ Pass on the windshield of my new car and it keeps falling off.
1,Singing can really butcher music.,"I made the mistake of purchasing this CD because it was the cheapest one with the song Tuxedo Junction on it. Unfortunately, someone is singing throughout the entire CD and it's just terrible!"
3,Unremittingly Grim,"This book is dark and ugly. While reading it, I felt like I was wallowing in excrement, much like Renton did in the outhouse in ""Trainspotting."" The narrator fondles his dying sister and shoots up his mother's remains. What's next: his dad, a plunger, and a well-oiled gerbil?!There's some good writing here, especially the story about the poor fat kid ruthlessly tortured at summer camp. But this book is the ugly runt cousin of books like ""Jesus' Son,"" and maxxed out my limit on smack-shooting sibling-molesting misery."
3,Width Not Really US Widths,"The shoe itself is sturdy, well designed and well made; however, the width is actually one width less. For example, a Wide is actually only a C and not really a D."
4,Interesting themed art book,"This book features photos of artworks from many time periods showing dogs. Most of the artworks are realistic in style. Towards the end, there are a few more modern paintings. I wish the author would have included more modern paintings. Anyway, this is a great book to introduce young children to art appreciation."
5,GREAT VALUE AND FUN,"My daughter got this for Christmas when she was about 18 mos old from her Aunt. I really didn't think much of it at first, but my daughter did. It has a bunch of food, although I took a couple pcs. away until she got older. The microwave lights up when cooking is done, it talks, and the tray inside spins when ""cooking"" like a real microwave. It's been dropped on the floor, abused, and still works great. It's played w/ almost every day for more than a year now. For the price, it's a win win. Great addition to a table top stove or sink your child already has."
4,Yummy!,I've gotten Rusk lotion as a free sample in a variety of hotels and was so happy to discover I could buy it for my own home. It has a delicious and refreshing scent that I've become addicted to.
3,Good for new moms just starting out with an exercise routine,"After staying in shape through my 2nd and 3rd pregnancies with Denise's Pregnancy Plus Workout, I tried this video and found it to be too easy and somewhat frustrating. When Denise wasn't making her own mistakes in the routine (typical from what I've seen on some of Denise's other videos) I felt like I wasn't getting much of a workout. During the toning exercises, I even pushed the pause button to get in a few additional reps. The yoga exercises at the end were ok if you're into that kind of thing--I found it completely boring. I did this workout exactly 5 times before putting it on the shelf.When doing this workout, make sure you have plenty of room for some of the aerobic exercises and get a towel (small bath size will do) for some of the toning exercises.This is a good tape for new moms who are just starting out with an exercise program. Some of you ""old pro's"" may want something a little more challenging."
2,Way too many reps and Denise Austin is annoying,"I found this tape to be good for my very first workout postpartum, but after that it is very annoying. The music is not motivating and Denise Austin makes too many mistakes for a workout instructor. The toning segments are too few to feel like they do any good and the workout consists of what seems like an eternity of the same thing."
3,Grad Plates,All though the quality was ok it wasn't what I thought it would be. My daughter graduated from high school and I thought I could use these plates for food but the were not as strong as I thought so used them for something else and bought other plates for her party
5,Fun For All Ages,"This game is a great strategy/action game. It is fun for everyone from 8 to 80. Be a pirate, swash buckle, dance with the governor's daughter to get great items to help you plunder. Talk to the characters at the tavern for information and most importantly blow up ships and build your fleet!"
4,Fun for awhile,"Sid Meier's Pirates is inventive and original. It has some aspects of the game that I haven't seen in other games. I like the idea of trying to build up my treasure within a certain time frame (your pirate ages and you can only be a pirate for so long before your health can't take it anymore). Trying to win the love of the daughters of the Govenors in the different cities is also fun. The only problem is after awhile the game starts to feel repetitive. If you are trying to sail against the wind for a long journey, it can take forever to get there (it would be nice if there was a way to speed up the sailing). Overall it is a fun game, but I have to take long breaks away from it for it to keep being fun."
5,Yarrgh! This product be worth it's weight in gold!,"Bought as a birthday present to one of my many nephews. He's a pirate-a-holic I guess you could say, and being a boy, addicted to video games as well. I know, I know, it almost seems like I'm just adding fuel to the fire, but I checked out a few other reviews and said that this simulation game actually teaches a little about economy and supply-and-demand. Maybe it's just wishful thinking? Haha, oh well... boys will be boys! Yarrrgh!"
3,No place for the pen,My HP Jornada 548 fits nice in it but there is no room for the pen. Bad thing. Hard to open also.
2,doesn't work for me,"The good thing about his product is the protection it offers, it is sturdy.But, you can't get to the stylus while the palm is open in the case, and you have to take it out to sync it. All the removing and inserting, I'm concerned the neoprene that holds the palm in place will wear fast... plus it feel very klunky."
3,What an ending,"I love this series. But I just cannot be very positive about this book. It has more than normal of Dunnett's confused and overly complex passages. And after fighting with the book it seemed nearly all the way, Iceland offered potential for another of Dunnett's amazing climaxes. But without giving anything away, all I can say is I found the ending to be just completely wrong. Completely out of character, completely without any sense, completely incomprehensible. What a place to leave us. Well, Dunnett has taken us on the emotional rollercoaster before. Has she just delayed the conclusion to the next book... I'll be reading it as soon as she has it ready."
1,Unbearable,"It's not often that I start reading a book and won't finish. It has to be pretty bad for me to drop it, and this book achieved this level. I didn't care anything about the characters, I didn't care anything about what was going on (when I could figure out just what was going on), and the writing was stilted. Boring, at times predictable, and uninvolving."
4,Toolbox for Neural Net System Identification,"The book is straight forward and useful. However, I would like to see more examples using MATLAB."
1,Don't believe a word of it.,"A very minimal amount of research will tell you that 1) this is by far Mr. Harris's best known and most popular work and that 2) it is at best ""highly unreliable"", as one source charitably puts it.I happen to think there is something very suspect, or at least very curious, about being known primarily for your autobiography. If we hadn't heard of you from elsewhere, why would we want to read your autobiography in the first place? Well, in this case the answer is fairly obvious (for certain of us, that is, not me), but, on the other hand, anyone can do that, especially if he's allowed simply to manufacture the anecdotes.In short, you're wasting your time bothering with this boastful, swaggering, blustering imposture."
5,My life and loves,I read this book over 40 years ago and wanted to refresh my memory. Although it is erotic it also is a depiction of life in the 19th and early 20th centuries in England and the U.S. The author was obviously a well educated person and a bit boastful but the descriptions of life are most vivid. I saw a movie of part of the book and it starred Jack Lemmon playing the part of Frank Harris. I loved the story!!
2,"The Hipster Spies With His Mystic Eye---Very Bovine, But Rather Uninspired","The instrumentals aren't bad, but the vocals are uninspired.Boring & flat.Go buy an Irish Rovers or Chieftans album instead."
4,Rock with melody and originality - not Nirvana riffs,"I've been into the Jesus and Mary Chain for a while, but I've often heard that ""die-hard fans"" won't like this album. Not true. It's mellow (mostly acoustic), but has some of the best melodies and vocals they've ever done. Anyone who likes melodic rock (with slight punk influences still evident) will probably like this CD. To give a comparison, if you like the mellower Smashing Pumpkins songs, or the Velvet Underground (who were an influence on the J&MC), you should listen to this. Another J&MC CD worth buying if you're new to them, which has some harder, noiser stuff as well, is ""The Jesus and Mary Chain Hate Rock N' Roll"". They have a new one coming out in June called ""Munki"" which will be on the Subpop label."
2,This game will make you Cry if it glitches!,"This game is great. I love working the farm, caring for the animals and raising the levels of my crops. What I don't like are the insane glitches. I have had to start my game over 3 times because both save spots went to black screens. If you can't deal with a game you have to spend many hours on to get anywhere going perm black screen and refusing to load, this is not the game for you."
2,Great Game / ANNOYING GLITCHES!,"I purchased this game because I loved playing Harvest Moon on my Playstation. I was married, my wife was ""with child"", and I had found all but 2 of the cursed tools. I was anal about saving my game in BOTH slots so that I wouldn't run the risk of anything happening to my 3 months of progress. Turned on my game this morning to find that NEITHER saved game will load. The game freezes up and won't let me do ANYTHING. Talk about frustrating! I think it's time for me to give up my dreams of ruling Mineral Town ... or start ALL over."
2,Misrepresented,"This was not the product that was advertised. It was billed as a ""witty, erotic spoof of the Japanese Ringu movies, from the director of the fluffer"" I thought I was purchasing a comedy. It's nothing but soft-core porn. Don't get me wrong, the boys are hot but all the ""good bits"" have been cut out. If you like soft-core, this is a wonderful title. If you want to hurtle the remote at the screen when ""good bits"" are edited, run down the local XXX video store."
4,Appears to fill the need for a safe travel case for dSLR's,"This case fills the need for a safe travel case for a small dSLR and a couple of lenses. It is pretty snug for my K10D, which is a medium sized dSLR. It was able to fit the body with a lens, a couple of telephoto lenses, and a smaller prime lens snugly. The hard case is bomb-proof. The soft case fits really tight into the hard case, which is not a bad thing since things won't move around inside. The fit is so tight, the shoulder strap won't fit in with the softcase. Again, not an issue since that strap can be put into another bag without a problem. I gave this case 4 stars, it is a good product. It would get 5 stars if it had a way to attach the shoulder strap outside the hardcase to make it easier to carry."
3,Moody coming-of-age film.,"According to Greta starring Hilary Duff tends to go overboard on the teen angst. I have never thought much of Duff as an actress or singer. Duff tries her best to move away from her goody-goody past but I found her performance very contrived and wooden. Ellen Burstyn saves this teen drama from total disaster, her warmth and strong acting chops are well above average like always. Parts of this film feel like a watered-down version of Georgia Rule minus the sexual abuse angle. According to Greta shines in parts but casting Duff in the title role was a major mistake."
1,Not for me,"The first half of this movie held my attention but the second half seemed rushed and went downhill. Much of it was unrealistic, for example: customers laughing at Greta's poor attitude as a waitress. In reality she would have been told off or fired the first day.Originally I thought this would be a fun movie to watch with teens but by the end, with all the rudeness and talk of suicide, I can't imagine sharing it with teens. It's not cute to be rude to parents, relatives and/or friends... What is the real message of this movie? I didn't see a big turn around in attitude in the end. She does change a little, but it just didn't seem authentic which is why I feel perhaps it was too rushed. -There are just too many great films out there to recommend above this one."
2,Not my kind of movie,"Based on just Hillary Duff, I would probably just give this movie just one star, but ""Grams"" and Julie keep the movie from being a total waste of time.Too chick flick for me, and while it might be entertaining for tweens, I think that it would be too awful for most people over the age of 16.I did not find Hillary Duff to be convincing in her role, overall I just felt like I was watching a bad episode of her show on the Disney Channel"
4,Mature story line...,"A young woman plans on killing herself and is obsessed about the different methods she may try. She is obviously struggling with where she fits in within this world. This is a mature film and I hope that the fact that Hillary Duff plays the lead role does not attract children who are too young and immature because I don't think that they'd understand it really. In other words, this isn't the kind of movie you'd expect her to star in. I did enjoy the film though, and thought that she did a good job playing her character. It's for the older teens though - definitely not her younger fans."
1,Don't like this Genre,I am not a fan of this genre of film and therefore did not like the movie. I wanted to duct tape Hilary Duff's character's mouth shut!
1,sickening and unpleasant!!!.,"there is nothing entertaining about this sickening, unpleasant , pretentious and garbage film concerning a self-pitying american brat and here spineless grandparents.the lead character (play by hilary duff) is sent to spend summer with her wimpy grandparents and upon her arrival is inexcusably disrespectable to every adult she meets. it would seem her grand parents and every other adult she comes in contact with, have to beg her for her attention and are too afraid of her to dicipline her(how pathetic!!!.) . this film tries to sell the notion that teen disrespectable behavior is acceptable and that adults must beg them for their attention and approval.hilary duff's character is so unlikable and unpleasant that one wishes that she would in fact commit suicide so that we can be spared any further aggravation and this dammnd movie will end never to be watched again."
1,"Comments From A Mom, And An 8, 11, And 16 Year Old","Since I know little or nothing about Hilary Duff - and this did not seem like my kind of film - I gave it to a Mom and her eight, eleven, and sixteen year olds for review. Here is their recap:From Mom - Not a good film for little kids, due to high sexual content and high school oriented themes.From the Eight And Eleven Year Old - didn't like the main character. She is mean and disrespectful. Both agreed they would nt pay to see the film.From the Sixteen Year Old - It's hard to watch such a manipulative girl be so disrespectful to everyone she meets. It reminded her of terrible girls at school she avoids at all costs, so why go to a movie about them? She also said it was boring and she would not recommend.So, it seems like a resounding thumbs down from the target market."
2,Still Not Impressed....,"This one is a bit more focused than the first LTE album, but still overrated. For my money, there's still way too much on here that goes nowhere - and why not? It's improvised, after all! If you jammed/improvised with your band for an hour, you'd come up with some good parts which you'd extract and develop a song around. You'd also have a whole bunch of twaddle that should remain shelved. LTE chooses to give us the whole hour, including twaddle.What really bugs me about this album is the instrument tones. The guitar and keyboards have some downright ugly, irritating sounds. Even Tony Levin's stick bass groans like a wounded dinosaur in some parts. I like heavy prog-metal, but some of this stuff (the end of ""Another Dimension"" - ugh, stop that stupid riff already!) is GRATING ON THE EARS!"
3,not as great as the first,"i liked LTE1, but this one was ok. Acid Rain was definatly one to like. Biaxident was pretty good, reminded me of Freedom of Speech from the previous album. 914 is interesting for its dark theme. i like another dimension as all of its odd time signatures. when the water breaks is ok. chewbacca is the only track which i dont like. Liquid dreams and Hourglass are probably the most soothing of them all. not a bad cd, but could have been better. otherwise, the musicianship is still at the top of its game."
2,Brevity...,"Impressive technicality is no substitute for soul. Sadly, Mr. Portnoy and Mr. Pattrucci for the second time show their blatant failure to understand this."
3,Worthwhile Leftovers,"If You LOVE LTE 1; you are a confessed gear freak, guitarist that does not wince when people know you Love Prog??? This a must purchase. It is a shame that it seems like maybe scheduling prevented these guys from putting together a continuation or extension of this project that lives and breathes as well as the first...buy it cause nothing else like this exists.A true Gem with Petrucci/Rudess is the Solo Piano/Guitar disc that is on Vai's ""Favored Nations"" Label...absolutely worth the effort and every penny."
5,Exellent technical album,Every time when I listen LTE1 or LTE2 I find and hear new instrumental musical things- fantastic! One of the greatest progressiv CD`s I`ve ever heard.
5,Very comfortable,"I like this shirt well enough I was going to order more in other colors when they raised the price. I may still order some.Size is extremely loose. I usually wear XL, sometimes even XXL if a shirt is tight. Here I wear a large. Believe the other reviewers and order the next smaller size than you usually wear. I did and am happy. The fit is still loose.The shirt is very comfortable and cool to wear. Some pockets are deep enough you may need to fish around to find your phone or whatnot.Looks good, definitely casual, but decent."
5,"very good , excellent , accordance with the received , RECEIVED IN TIME","very good , excellent , accordance with the received , RECEIVED IN TIMEvery good , excellent , accordance with the received , RECEIVED IN TIMEvery good , excellent , accordance with the received , RECEIVED IN TIME"
2,MY OPINION,"The product arrived in good condition and is a great shirt, just with a little delay for new year season.Columbia mens shirts.They are a completes size. for next buy i have to order a size less.AND THE COLOR IS NOT CORRECT AS MY ORDER."
3,Nice shirt but way oversized,"I liked the shirt a lot. It's great for all sorts of outdoor activities and travel, and it made very well. However, it's tremendously over-sized. I usually wear an XXL in Columbia shirts and this fit like a 3XL. Have to return this one."
2,"Great comfort, horrible quality.","If you expect a button to come off every single time you clean these shirts, this shirt is for you. They are comfortable, but not worth the effort of finding and sewing buttons back on all the time. I do not recommend these shirts."
4,Grand Class,"I really like the shirt, has a very good finish and the brand is excellent.Keep in mind when choosing the size, which are quite large, which I had to send her to buy a tailor because I am very big."
1,Wish I wouldn't have wasted the money...,"Okay... So this model doesn't have a grade rating because it would be lower than anything there is. It's terrible. There are only 5 points of articulation including the neck. I's incredibly cheap and totally not worth anything near what it's priced here. I don't think I would buy it at the dollar store, to be honest..."
1,You get what you pay for,"This has a life span of 6 months with any luck. Very poorly engineered, cheap components. Out of the box it sounds OK but it begins to rapidly deteriorate. Save your money and get a different brand. There is a reason Pyramid amps are so inexpensive. The wattage ratings on these amps are misleading as well."
4,Fun Nostalgia,"Impulsively went back to read my childhood favorite of oh-so-many years ago. Still a cute story and a rousing ""noble"" adventure, but definitely sexist in the manner of its time.I particularly enjoyed the delicate description of how Perdita ""got married"" and the emotional complications of having an attractive young female dog suddenly appear in Pongo's family. And the breezy overview of how Mr. Dearly came to be suddenly wealthy is very amusing - much like Monty Python's ""How to Rid the World of All Known Diseases.""I don't know that I would give this book to a child today without a bit of framing discussion, but it certainly was a pleasure to reread it myself. As everyone notes, it's much much better than the animated movie."
4,101 dalmatians,I read this book for the first time when I was a girl and lost it somewhere to read it again after all these years was truly a joy
1,what a rip-off,"now i know why there is no detail. i assumed that because of the price, i would be getting a cd with the 2 albums of melting pot and soul limbo.instead, it consists of 3 songs - 2 versions of melting pot and 1 version of soul limbo.amazon should be ashamed of this deception."
2,Not quite there....,I thought this book was marginally entertaining and couldn't put my finger on why I didn't like it as well as Shop Girl. It wasn't until I read Mark Haddon's The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Nighttime that I knew the problem. The main character lacks authenticity. You find empathy for Haddon's autistic character even though he's not asking for it. Steve Martin's attempt to promote empathy in the reader is contrived. It is not bad but if you read Haddon's novel you will see the difference between good and brilliant writing.
4,A nice little book,"Nothing exceptional, but an enjoyable and interesting book. As others have mentioned, it's a quick and easy read and worth the short investment of time required.Steve Martin develops an interesting character, and the story twists a number of unexpected ways.If you enjoyed this you must read The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time by Mark Haddon -- a similar but far superior book (and that's not a knock on The Pleasure of My Company)."
5,What A Delight!!,"I loved this! Having read ""Shopgirl"" previously, I already knew I'd enjoy Martin's cool, quirky style.Much better plot here. Daniel (main character) almost jumps to life from the pages. I loved the endless drone of his days, his ""affections"", his grand sense of humor. Oh, and how darling his love for Kinko's!Such a tiny book, it reads effortlessly, yet I found myself reading slower, savoring each morsel.Without giving anything away, read this book. You will be totally satisfied!Bravo, Mr. Martin. You have yet another gift!"
5,A truly wonderful book,"I have been a huge Steve Martin fan ever since I saw Father of the Bride as a little girl. When I discovered that Mr. Martin was also an author, I raced to the book store and picked up copies of Shopgirl and The Pleasure of My Company. This book in particular (The Pleasure of My Company) absolutely blew me away. It is clever, sensitive, touching...just absolutely brilliant. Steve Martin really showcases his talent in this book by telling the story of a man living with obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), using just enough humor to keep the story lighthearted and fun, but enough candor to provide a very insightful look into the lives of people living with OCD. Once I started reading, I simply could not put the book down. When I finished the book, I gave it to my mom and she couldn't stop talking about how much she loved it too!! I definitely recommend this book as an enjoyable read for anyone."
4,An exageration of everyones inner-dialogue,"This book was fantastic. Some have said that the lead character isn't likeable...likeable or not, Martin has created a character that simply magnifies all that lives in each of us. Anyone that feels they occasionally live inside their own head a little too much will fall over laughing while also starting to wonder if they are truly neurotic, not normal, while reading this book. The ending is fantastic...Martin is great with words, incredibly humorous, but also has something to say. I was very surprised with how deeply this little book touched me."
5,Slam Dunk!,"I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys an honest and in-depth story about an interesting character. You might expect Mr. Martin to fill these pages with slap stick, in-your-face comedy. Instead you will find a subtle and well crafted humor that transcends the ""one liner"" mentality. Several months after reading it my wife and I still bring Daniel Pecan Cambridge into our conversations occasionaly because this is one character who made a long lasting impression on us!"
4,Martin's style is a delight to read,"Steve Martin's brilliance never ceases to amaze me. His dry, biting, and intricate style is always dead-on. What makes Martin such a great writer is that he is such a keen observer of human nature and most importantly, of human flaws. His latest book takes this idea to a new level.Daniel Pecan Cambridge is certainly flawed. Through humor, we see what it's like to be virtually crippled by OCD and paranoia. Although the ending is a wee bit simplistic, I believe it is probably necessary for the novella form to really work. Martin captures so wonderfully the loneliness of Southern California life, and getting inside the mind of Daniel is a treat. I'm glad that Martin uses this first-person style of narration.Steve Martin is creative, interesting, and downright hilarious as a comedian. As a writer, he proves with this second novella that he is all of these things and more."
5,Misunderstood by many,"I don't know if everyone just expected Blair Witch II to be the same as Blair one only with different actors or what, but I don't find anything disappointing about this movie. Alot of reviewers have not liked it, but I think they have been short sighted. It is COMPLETELY different from the 1st movie, and that is it's strength. It still stems it's story from the Blair Witch legend which we had all come to know somewhat in the 1st one. This movie expands the story of the legend and takes it further. You can't run from the touch of the witch. I think this movie is the answer to the speculation ""What if the documentary students had gotten out of the woods in the first one?"" It's a real trippy movie that makes your head spin, confuse and frightens. It's creepy. For those of you who haven't seen it I don't want to say too much, but I will say I never realized just HOW scary having ""amnesia"" could be. EXCELLENT FLICK"
2,"Where's The ""Connection""?",I'll be short and sweet about this movie.1. It had nothing to do with the first movie.2. The acting was shall we say (poor).3. The film quality was terrible!I know Blair Witch 3 will be better! Let's hope they take it back to the original story line.
1,Blair Witch 2...,"The first movie was like reality,but this one really stunk,and was weak.The plot needed more work,and the horror needs to be more scarier.Don't rent,see,or buy this trash."
4,not everything is as is seems,i liked this movie a lot. its completely different from the origional but totaly origional.A tour group stays at the site where the footage of the 1st movie was found and they record everything and when they wake up they cant remember 5 hours of what happened that night so they go to the tapes and realize that they killed another tour group and went insane for that night. Then they start blameing eachother...there is a cool twist at the end and its so hard to explain so i wont try. even tho this doesnt hold a candle to the origional its still a great movie! not the best acting but its still pretty cool and the story line is very creative. it really isnt that scary just really suspensful. this movie could have done very well on its own i.e. not a sequal.
1,WARNING: This sequil does not co-exist with the origianal...,"...only the legend. But thats not good enough. When I waited for a sequil to ""The Blair Witch Project"" I was hoping that it would contunue where the first one left off. But Joe Berlinger was so obsessed with realism that in the plot, the original was just merely a movie. Now i just have one question for Joe: In the BW2 universe, if the legend was real then how could the actors/filmmakers come out of it without even a scratch. But, noooo, not these kids in this one, they were affected by the legend and 2 died. Sounds like a mjor plothole to me, Joe. For true fans of the original, I plead, FORGET THIS ONE!"
1,Do you smell something?,"You'll like this movie a lot if you're the kind of person who likes really dumb movies. However, if you're not the kind of person who likes really dumb movies, then you'll think this is one of the worst movies in the history of cinema. I happen to fall in to the later category because I'm not the kind of person who likes really dumb movies."
4,Why is this movie getting dogged like this?,"okay i admit BWP2 wasnt such a great film, however it doesnt deserve the reviews it recieved. It was maybe one of the only films this year that made me think. I especially liked the part at the end where you are let in on secrets in the film, its kinda weird, watch it and see. Good film deserves respect, dont be dread, later."
1,Not a horror (Just scary that I paid $20 for it),"This movie was bad! It had bad actors not plot, no storyline and the ending was bad.I wish it had told more about the Blair Witch legacy and not about the lives of five fans of the movie. The Blair Witch fame was ultimitly shot down by this movie."
2,Let down,"While it's not a particularly bad movie, BOS:BW2 goes from a completely original premise in the first movie and just reverts back to a run-of-the-maill horror movie. Each character feel like he or she is developed halfway, throw in some spooky, unexplainable occurances and BAM! Instant Movie ..."
2,what the ?!?,"I was so dissapointed by this mess,it starts out strong with an energy filled intro to the dumb kids who go on a trip to the woods they could have taken themselves for free,but decide to pay some fruit cake they havent even seen on a blair witch web site.To make a long story short, you know the creators should have been beaten with a baseball bat when they put the characters in an abandoned broom factory.plus the only way they THINK they find out what happens to them after they blackout is on video that they have to watch backwards?!? How in the world you screw up a movie like this i will never know...."
2,Book? What Book?,"There is no ""Book of Shadows"" to be found in this fast and cheap mistake. While the first film was highly overrated, this one received far more attention than it deserved. The result are incomplete ideas and a misleading title. Pray this mediocre effort kills the series. And if you have enough time to rewind through this mess to find the ""hidden"" stuff mentioned in the mockumentary ""Esrever,"" then you need to go outside and find some friends."
1,Back to horrible teen horror junk.,"The first movie was the greatest. When I first saw it, it was the first time I found myself losing time in a horror movie.But even if this movie wasn't being compared to the first Blair Witch movie, I would still rate it the same. This is just a sorry, desperate attempt to make more money off the title."
1,"Pitiful, Unworthy Of Title","This movie should not even have been made. It stunk to high heaven. It is unworthy of being called a sequel as well as a part of the blair witch phenomenia. The acting was poor, the plot made absolutely no sense, especially since there was no shred of info about the blair witch with the exception of the girl freaking out at the end. It wasn't worth seeing in the movie and a definite waste of money to rent. I think I will stick with blair witch project and the books, to chuck this tape in the garbage."
4,Watchable!!,"Contrary to what I heard, I actually liked this movie. I thought it was very innovative and different. I have never saw a concept that twisted in anybody's movie. I guess you really have to understand what truely happened in order to get what was going on in the movie, or else you won't like it. This movie really makes you think."
1,Unexplainably terrible. Steer clear.,"It would have been really nice if the sequel-makers out there had just left The Blair Witch Project alone. Then I wouldn't have had to sit through this confusing, unintelligent pile of junk when I could of spent my time watching valuable films. The film does have some visual value, but not even close enough to save the movie. The acting is not top class, the film is horribly directed and the scripting is awful. It's really difficult to come up with a worse way to sequelize such a fantastic film. This movie does not have the eerie feeling or the after-viewing effect as The Blair Witch Project did, and with movies like that, both of those have to be there, or you'll end up with a lifeless, useless, sod of a film. It will be forever remembered as Book of Poo: Blair Witch 2."
3,Enjoyable ... But Flawed,"Enjoyable sequel to the highly successful - and highly over-rated Blair Witch. Artisan Entertainment actually gave this film a budget, and helps to deliver a surreal, somewhat creepy horror film. Creative direction and some above average acting destroys the general rule that ""horror sequels suck"". That is not to say that this film is not flawed. It is. Like for instance, what is the Book of Shadows? Ask Joe Berlinger."
3,Just Average,Not what I thought it was going to be about. It's nothing like the original which I think is a mistake. The producers decided to rely on conventional movie making. The results are just average at best. Nothing special here. Very sad because they could have done much more.
2,More watchable than the first....,"I found myself fast forwarding through much of the first movie (I found it boring and stupid). At least this movie made an attempt at a plot. But this movie was overdone and was only entertaining from a ""campy"" (funny) point of view."
3,Good Witch? Bad Witch?,"Before watching this film I had built up an expectation that I was about to view a film, which would be bad and when I say bad I mean terribly bad. This was a view, which I had purely obtained from the various reviews I had read. However this film is NOT terribly bad, in fact it's very watchable. Alright so the acting in places leaves a lot to be desired and its not particularly scary for a horror movie. But the story kept my interest right till the very end and made me feel that it was a worthwhile 90 minutes of my time. Also despite the bad acting and possible miscasting, the characters actually worked quite well together.I think this films biggest mistake was to have the number 2 in its title, had it been advertised as more of a spin off to the original then I think this film would have won a few more fans."
1,A QUICK QUESTION,"Have you noticed most of the people who liked this film could not even spell the little words in the review they left? This is not the worst movie ever made by far (that is called LUCKY NUMBERS...) But this movie is an insult to the imagination felt by the fans of the first. This movie is a revelation to those far too thick to understand the first, yet at any rate is an inferior film. Joe Berlinger's ""CROCKumentaries"" have been EXTREMELY manipulated, contrived and faked throughout his ""career"". 'Paradise' 'Brothers' etc. are jokes. This film, no, MOVIE only further exposes what a joke of a filmmaker he is. Shame on Joe for his stupid, greedy take of a sequel he could only hope to dream about. Shame on Artisan for letting such an untalented man ruin the franchise so soon."
2,What?,"That one woman who died and ended up in the closet wasn't too bad looking. Too bad she died. That goth girl was pretty ugly. This movie was a little better than the original. It actually had somewhat something of a story and stuff ahppened. It just doesn't shape up to the good movies of the suspense or horror genres. Rent this or buy it really cheap used. Don't get it neww, unless you like crap horror movies."
3,Its Alright,"I expected to much from Papa Roach. The concert is good, but i wish they played more from the infest cd."
4,A quite useful book on grid generation for beginner,"The first chapter on tensor analysis is quite appealing and it is still refreshing for me who has experience with tensor analysis. The last chapter on unstructured grid generation is very helpful for me. I think it is a useful book for beginner in this field and can be a valuable reference book for experienced.In computational fluid mechanics and solid mechanics, finite volume and finite element methods can deal with unstructured meshes relatively easily. So some of the grid generation techniques for finite difference method described in this book maybe less important than, say, 20 years ago."
5,A must have for puzzle lovers!!,I bought this game for my husband for Christmas and he's totally enjoying this game! He doesn't have to carry a pen and booklet around and the variety and levels of the puzzles still suprise him after playing it daily since Christmas.
2,Rather stay in the warm,"I brought this novel having not read a spy novel before. But the le Carre books have always caught my eye with their mystique and the acclaim that its garnished from reviewers. I was pretty dissapointed. le Carre is certainly a gifted writer and the style of his writing leads to a shrouded, gritty urban atmosphere that lends well to a spy novel. However, the plot was pretty mundane and by halfway through the book it was becoming a real labour to finish and I was well past the point of caring about the outcome. For anyone who is a keen reader of espionage fiction this is probably the book for them. For myself, a novice in the world of spy fiction, I found it mundane and ultimately forgettable."
2,Not Le Carré's best work...,"Quite frankly, I don't understand why this book is lauded as Le Carré's greatest novel. It seems that the only purpose of this novel is to show us how immoral espionage is and to show how know in the Cold War was ""right"". However, it does this by long and boring dialogues throughout the protagonist's many interrogations. By the time the book starts to pick up, it seems Le Carré decides he has said enough and rather abruptly ends it. If you want a better example of Le Carré's work stick to Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy, and the other books in that series"
2,I feel cold,"The cold in the title is spot on, this story left my cold (purposefully, I'm sure). The characters were either too cynical or had motivations I was unable to sympathize with, like the girl, who was a member of the communist party but in truth just wanted to get a husband. The book was very clear on that, she was as ordinary as it gets. Communists just recited typical communist propaganda, with a touch of nazism once in a while, and were hardly fascinating as the opponents. The ending was unsurprising, because it was obvious that one of two alternatives was true, and it wasn't even possible to admire the cold cleverness of the story. I don't know how it would puzzle anyone, even though the reviews say otherwise. If it had been a true story, at least I would know how espionage was really like. As a work of fiction I couldn't find anything in it to love, the characters or the plot."
5,A change of pace for the normal spy novel,This is my first review so you know its gonna be good or bad. I am happy to say that it is one of the best novels I have read all year. John Le Carre created a spy novel that had me captivated by the inner dialogue of the main character alone. A must read.
4,great picture low volume output,build quality is great. picture is great. volume output is too low making the tv hard to hear if there is any ambient niose whatsoever
2,Great Picture but Poor Audio,"The picture is great. However, the volume on this TV even at the maximum setting of 50, is not loud enough. If you are going to buy this, be prepared to purchase an external set of speakers. I've just returned the TV to the seller. If it is for a small room such as a bedroom, it may be OK, but not for a den or living room."
3,Don't Start Here-- Muddled Hemingway,"I understand this book was written as a contractual necessity, and it feels cobbled together by Hemingway. The first two portions seem straightforward, and qualify as good short stories about Harry Morgan, a down-at-heels boat-owner in the Florida Keys. The third seems destined to follow along a similar path, and then Hemingway throws in everything but the kitchen sink (like the cliche? It belongs in this section of the book) as Harry becomes a minor character in a hackneyed social-realist critique of just about EVERYHTING: communism, capitalism, alcoholism, any ism you can think of. New characters are introduced and forgotten every few pages. Hemingway cleaned out his junk drawer and stuck it here.So: completists please read. Otherwise, stick with Hemingway's short stories. Or better yet, read some Hammett."
4,The Most UNDERRATED Hemingway Novel,"This book belongs up there with Hemingway's better known books, The Sun Also Rises, For Whom the Bell Tolls and The Old Man and the Sea. Papa unapologetically presents characters who do bad things. Some people have cited the racial slurs and the crimes the characters commit as problematic, but Hemingway displays these things without condoning them. He isn't writing what is good and bad. He is writing what happens. These things happen. People hate. people kill. People become desperate. Hemingway is at heart a reporter and he has crafted a tremendous story and a great book."
3,To Have & Have Not,"Book was not is as good of shape as advertized. But all I wanted to do is read it, which I did. Title is mentioned in recent Kenny Chesney song. I wanted to know more about it."
4,Revisiting a Flawed Classic,"Interesting to revisit this book after many years passing since I first read it. It's particularly interesting to read Hemingway's view of the Cuban revolution in the making, as well as getting a view of the violence in the background of those times when Cuba was a ""playground"" for some pretty unsavory types. Though it probably is one of Hemingway's worst, it still has its moments--thin characters and all. This is one of the few books where I'd say the movie was better. Bogart did it justice. Still...it's a damn good book by most anyone's standards."
2,To Have and Have Not: It just doesn't have it,"Harry Morgan is a poorly developed charcter. It is difficult to really sympethize with him. He has financial problems but doesn't just turn to smuggling, but murder. Reading a book without being able to sympethize with any character can be tedious. Hemingway may have been trying to show what happens to a man when society pushes him into poverty. The problem is that Morgan has no virtue at any point. Probably Hemingway's worst character."
5,Great Movie,"Excellent and traditional Siamese culture and music. What I rented was in Thai, not ""Taiwanese Chinese"". Subtitled in English. Beautiful photography, good acting. Recommended!"
1,Dubbing doesn't work,"This movie was fantastic. However, I must admit that I have not seen the version for sale here. I have been waiting with bated breath to own this film. It was shown in theaters in Thailand, in Thai, with English subtitles. However, I find that the version for sale here has been dubbed into Taiwanese Chinese with English subtitles. If anyone knows how to get a Thai version with English subtitles, please post the information in your review. Theresa Dunn"
3,A limited attempt at interfaith manual,"the book is an attempt at being interfaith but vast religious traditions are touched on lightly or not at all. I can see the need for such a book especially for New Agers etc., but it could be a more detailed and organized. A good first try."
1,Garbage,"Only useful for cleaning up the mess that dogs make inside the house. Flimsy, tear easy.. As the other reviewer said, they will bleed color on to your other clothes in the wash.There's a reason these things are on clearance. Horrible Quality. Don't let the thread count fool you, these are GARBAGE."
5,The ONLY collar REALLY SAFE for cats and kittens,"This collar stretches ALL OVER, not just at the buckle.Premier Twice as Nice Kitty Collar GoldThese are far superior to the collars with just two strings of elastic at the buckle. This means that is easily expands no matter where on the collar it is caught and the cat or kitten has plenty of room to slip out. I had heard horror stories, possibly apocryphal, about cats getting caught on fence tops and strangling. This collar would not have allowed that as it really does make enough room to pull the head out, and the buckle also releases easily. I searched all over until I found these and wouldn't buy any other kind for my precious fur-friends. These are adjustable and comfortable for the cats, and I know they are SAFE. I have had cats wear these for years and they still retain their stretch. I love all the color choices, too."
1,Horrible Quality Ink,"I purchased almost $80 worth of this Ink. When my ink cartridge ran out and I replaced it with this compatible brand, I was very disappointed with the quality. Of course by the time my genuine canon ink ran out, I could no longer return the G&G brand and I was stuck with them. I eventually just threw them away. They did a terrible job when it came to printing pictures. If you are just wanting to print things that aren't high quality, it worked ok but it's nothing compared to the genuine canon ink. The colors were off and didn't look right."
1,Cheesy,Absent of any quality. Throughly disappointing. All the Naxos Sherlock series is without ANY redeeming value
4,Nice Job Molly,Well written and entertaining. Shows you what frigging joke the mutual fund industry is. A great companion book to Monkey Business: Swinging Through the Wall Street Jungle (a somewhat more shocking look at Wall Street's seedy underbelly). Hopefully Ms. Baker will have more to write later.
2,"No adventures here, only snoozes.........","I really wanted to love this book and have been trying to figure out why I didn't; why I wanted to fling it into a pit of fire. Content-wise it told me all about Jerry to the nth degree. In a trite, trivial voice! Oh, it could have been a contender. It could have been wonderful because the follow-a-manager-for-a-year angle is cool. But the problem is Ms. Baker doesn't know how to tell an exciting story, a story with moments and dialogue and emotion. Instead, she transcribes facts! The pacing is turtle-slow, and the writer tries far too hard to be clever by saying things with icky cliches and similies. I wanted to take a pen and edit. I'm sorry to sound harsh that's not my intention because I really think it's not all the author's fault. The editors were asleep. Needs more white space and more pronouns instead of ""Jerry this"" and ""Jerry that."" Nothing fresh, not even a bit twisted. Sigh. What was it about again?"
1,"Early Failure, Don't Buy","I bought this cheap from a Staples during a sale and hooked it up. Everything worked fine for a month when write error messages started to appear. Then occasionally, all the data on the drive would be disappear, only to return when I restart it. I can't depend on this drive for my backups anymore and I am going to buy a more reliable model. This drive really isn't worth your time or money."
2,"Looks nice, but it's junky","I got this as a father's day gift. It looks very nice, but the handles of kabob skewers are injection-molded with plastic, which melted all over the grill when I actually used them. WTF? What genius puts plastic in tools that are going to be exposed to high temperatures?!? The case fell apart, the tongs are cumbersome, the salt/pepper shakers don't stay closed and are hard to clean, and the grill brush handle bends to pressure. The spatula works - I guess it's impossible to screw that up. Same with the fork and knife. Don't waste your time with this set."
4,A Glimpse into the future of Collaboration,"""Working Across Boundaries"" is a glimpse into the future of how ""virtual government"" is evolving in the dawn of the 21st century. This book isn't full of academic concepts. Russ Linden paints a picture using real examples of the dynamics to which public sector leaders will need to respond in order to be successful. Practitioners will be able to pick up this book and start applying its principles immediately."
3,Nothing new,"The book discussing concepts on adding wealth, however there are much better books on this topic."
5,Very good compilation,"I'm surprised that no one has reviewed this recording in the three years since it was released because it's a great CD. It culls 14 tracks from their first four releases: 2 tracks from Who Can You Trust?, 6 tracks from Big Calm, 4 tracks from Fragments of Freedom, and 2 tracks from Charango. Most people would agree, with some argument of course, that these are some of the best tracks from Morcheeba's first 3 albums and a couple of good ones from Charango. (I would have chucked ""Well Deserved Break"" from Fragments Of Freedom, in favor of something else from either Charango or Who Can You Trust.) If you can afford just one Morcheeba CD, then this is the one to buy. About 60 minutes of delicious music."
4,Great reading until Light and Magnestism,"I use both H&R and Tipler side by side. Tipler's explanations can be very valuable in H&R's shorter moments but H&R has the upper hand in Light and Magnetism. Tipler's approach in this area is simply not deep enough and leaves the reader unable to answer many basic questions. However, the illustrations are elegant and useful which make this book worth considering for any reference shelf."
1,Do not buy,Try as I might this hifi system will not play any CD's that I burn myself. So if you have created custom CDs this player will not work.
5,"Almost better than Sista Souljah's ""The coldest winter ever""","When I first read the title I thought ""enticing"". I was right. I dreamt about the book at night and hated to put it down at work. The book is great and a huge page turner. I just hope that Danita and Tracie come out with something great in the future."
1,Disappointed in Product,"We bought this days ago, and it is already going back. An impromptu stop at the store for a walker for my 10mos old to take on vacation so he wouldn't be cruising all the furninture at grandma's house. After three kids, I was missing the old ones I had for the other two, but was tempted because of its simplicity and ""no battery"" thing...let me break it down:*time consuming assembly, had to hunt down screwdriver*it tipped over immedietly as the baby pulled himself up, so it only worked when I held on to either him or the front of the walker, making this not an independent toy*within minutes mailslot doors came off*now have to hunt for ""mail"" so it can all go back to the store*the ""adjustable"" traction worked on some floors in our home, but not all of themon the plus side, it doesn't run on batteries, is pretty basic and the baby loved playing with the mail slots while the doors stayed on. Either way, I am returning it and getting a different activity walker for him."
2,Activity Walker,"There are much cuter activity walkers out there on the market, but, they also cost more money, so you have to decide what is important for you in a walker. Personally, my son only used the walker through his cruising to walking phase. As soon as he became a confident walker the toy lost all interest. I put it away in the ""baby"" things and was satisfied with the job it did helping him gain confidence in walking. That being said, if you want a toy to leave out and have your child play wiht after he learns to walk, this is not the toy. The mail slots come off way too easily and are boring. The mail pieces always wind up lost in the sea of toys and parts in the house. The accessory toys (bug themed) on the walker are way too hard to manipulate, plus never made much sense to me since the theme is a mailbox, what are the bugs doing on it?! You have to choose for yourself what you want in a walker and then go out and buy for those needs/wants."
1,This thing is going back!,"I bought this walker, and after putting it together I immediately had misgivings about it. It didn't seem very stable, and I was right. When my 9 month old son tried to use it to pull up it flipped over backwards. Luckily, since I had my suspicions about it doing just that, I was standing right behind him and able to catch him.In addition to tipping over, withing 1/2 hour he had the two ""mailbox"" panels pulled off the front of the activity area.I've already disassembled the walker and put it back in the box; it's going back to the store."
1,Don't waste your money,"My sister purchased this for my little guy for Christmas and it is not a good toy. It is a good walked, BUT the compartment doors on the front just fall off when you open them. I would not recommend this toy."
4,My son Loved this toy!,I recently bought this toy for our son. He has been cruising for weeks now from one piece of furniture to another. When I opened it he immediately began trotting across the living room. The other problem is not enough floor space. He gets upset when he hits the wall and it doesn't move anymore. Since we've bought this toy he has taken a few steps on his own. I believe it helps little ones learn to walk. I would recommend this toy to anyone.
1,Not a winner in our house,We were very displeased with this product. The pieces come off way too easy and the worst part about it is that when baby starts to tumble backwards the toy comes with! My daughter also cannot use the toy to pull up on either. We got a much better playskool one for $5 at a yard sale. Sorry I wasted my money on the other one.
3,Nice Walker - but pieces come off too easily.,"I like this walker to the 'learning to walk' aspect - but the activity part leaves something to be desired. It has potential, but the front two flaps are too easy to take off. This was the first thing my 11 month old did when she started playing with it. None of the parts or the equipment is dangerous when they come apart, just easy to loose."
3,It's just &quot;OK&quot;,"This was a gift, and it came just as my little one was starting to cruise. I wouldn't buy this myself because it just wasn't that much fun. It did assist in walking, but mostly the letters were carried around, doors ripped off etc. If you are on top of things & put it all back together after each playtime, then you won't lose the pieces. Otherwise, they'll be in the toy pile (or under your sofa!) Other children who came over just learning to stand up would try to climb on it after the doors were off. So it was a constant battle pulling them off so they wouldn't get hurt. Mine never tried that but mostly pulled the doors off to carry them or the letters around. That part was fun, but kept me busy tracking down the pieces. haha!"
1,Falls apart and tips over too easily,"This is a terrible toy for a child who is learning to pullup and walk! It is too light in the front, so when they try to pull up using the handle, it tips over on top of them. Also, the two little mail doors are the pop-in-the-hole type, so when my child leans on them trying to look behind them to see where the mail went or pull up on them, they fall off and she ends up falling and busting her head! Also, the three plastic ""mail"" cards are not attached and are always lost. After a week of watching it fall apart and taking care of numerous boo-boo's from her falling so much, I put the toy away for good."
3,disappointed in this toy,"We bought this for our son when he was 7 months old. The first thing he does is take the doors off, they come off so easy. He climbs in it using it for a ladder. It is very dangerous. He cannot move the little bugs on the front. I have to keep it folded up and in a corner so he cannot use it without us right there with him. He is now one year old and still like playing with the plastic ""letters"" that come with it more than anything else. He does walk with it, it is good for that. but when he was learning to take steps it would fall over on top of him when he would try to stand up holding the handle to walk with it. It is supposed to be a sturdy walker, but I don't agree with that. The base is not wide enough. My mother gave us a radio flyer walker wagon from LL Bean and this is MUCH better for little ones just learning to walk. It doesn't fall over when he uses the handle to stand up with, and it is VERY sturdy!I wish I had not spent the money on the wide tracker now."
2,"not good as a walker, so-so as a toy.","We bought this when my daughter was ready to start walking. She was able to stand by herself, and sometimes would make a step or two. So we thought it would help her to learn walking, however this toy did not help at all. The tires are plastic, so they slide very easily, which means a child has to run very fast in order not to fold down, because as soon as a child presses on the handle, the walker starts sliding forward like it's on ice.The leters and other ""fun"" features of the toy are ok, and my daughter played with them a little, but she was not really excited about the toy."
2,Not Happy,"My daughter likes to play with this toy and walks ok with it, However the handle is constantly coming off/apart and the other parts come off easily too. When she gets the front panels off, she immediatly starts climbing up it. She doesnt really use the bugs that move either. I'm not very satisfied."
4,Our son enjoyed it,I didn't like that the doors came off so easily or that my son could stand next to it and knock it over but he really enjoyed it. He was walking on his own within 2 weeks of having it.
3,"Ok toy, bad walker","I agree that this walker is not very study to help a child learn to walk. However, if used as a toy it can be fun if your child uses their imagination. With that said, children do not always have the same types of imagination so this will vary with each child.For play, yes the door do come off easily and as a parent it can be frustrating as well as for the child. However, my son likes to play post office with this walker and sometimes I've even seen him put a stuffed animal in the front like it's a stroller or something. So, it's an ok toy, but bad walker"
5,Ethan's Mom,"My son loves this toy. He got this toy as a gift when he was 10 months old. Yes the doors fall off but my son could care less. He uses this toy to walk all over the house. It is also light enough that we take it to the park, shopping, etc. so he can walk on his own when we go out. He has fallen down a few times as other people mentioned - but I assume this is the case with most early walkers. Now that he has the hang of using it he pulls himself up with the bar and has few problems walking around with it. I would say this is one of his favorite toys we own so I think it is quite a deal for the price."
2,Disappointed!!,"I was sooo excited to see this product and thought it would be perfect for my baby girl. So when grandma brought it home, we were thrilled and tried it out right away! When it is folded down on the ground, she loves it! All though the little doors just snap right off, she'll just play with the door, too. But she's learning to walk and thats the part I liked best, until she actually started walking with it. She lost her balance and fell backwards and the toy went backwards with her and smacked her in the face!!! This happened everytime she tried to pull up on it as well. So I have put it away in the closet for now. So be careful not to let your little one use this toy on hard surfaces!!! They might crack their head and smack their face at the same time!!!"
2,Not good for learning to stand,"I purchased this toy for the sole purpose of helping my baby to stand and then walk. He can stand if he pulls up on a couch or similar.Unfortunately, this product is so light and flimsy that it topples with the smallest amout of pressure. There's no way my baby can pull himself up on this toy unless I hold it, and then what's the point.In addition, I agree with several of the other parents' comments about the flaps being EASY to come off and then a hazard. My son loved (in the 1 day we owned it) to pull off the flap with the spinning disk and then promptly got his hand caught and pinched in it as he tried to lean on it.He did love biting the plastic envelopes, oh boy.I returned this product."
5,First Novel I ever read,"I started this series in 4th grade. I'm 24 now and I have read it over again about 4 times. This book was amazing when I was a child, and it still is. Brian Jacques does a fantastic job with his characters and scenery. The poems/riddles are great. The best of the series: Mattimeo. (3rd book)"
5,Redwall Series: Book 1: Redwall,This is a great book that will take you through adventurous quests and challenges. Jacques really gets you into the feel of the settings.
2,Unfortunately dissapointing,"I am a children's librarian, and an avid reader of fantasy. From C.S. Lewis to Tolkien and L'Engle, I have enjoyed them all. When I started Redwall, I planned on an excellent read. To my dissapointment, I found it redunant, filled with superlatives, and amazingly uninteresting...there is a common sympathy for Matthias, which I found admirable, but I found it hard to turn the next page, and the next..there are authors out there with a much more distinctive style, like L'Engle or Yolen, or authors who go with the mainstream, yet shape their books with a unique point of view, like newcomer J.K. Rowling. what is surprising is the fact that there are so many books in the Redwall series. Jacques is a good author, but there is something lacking."
2,Misses the mark,"Like a previous reviewer noted, there are a few problems of scale that occasionally hurt the suspension of disbelief. Also, I have trouble reconciling the death and violence with the kiddy wordings that appear here and there (such as the second paragraph in the book: ""Bump!""). I mean, it's not like the violence is incredibly graphic or disturbing, it's just out of place if this is to be considered a children's book (which I think it is).Mainly, though, my gripe is simply that it's not a compelling book. I managed to get all the way through it, but it wasn't exactly a page-turner, and I don't plan to read any more in the series.Instead, I recommend the Harry Potter series by J. K. Rowling, the Xanth series by Piers Anthony, and any of Robert A. Heinlein's juvenile science fiction books (such as Tunnel in the Sky). These are suitable for kids, yet are not ""kiddy."" They read just as well for adults as for kids."
5,an amazing articulation of words flowing from the pages to my mind,"I loved this book. It was the first redwall book I had ever read, now several books later, I am sharing my joy."
5,Redwall Rocks!,"The Redwall books are amazing. There are 15 300+ page books, enough to make even the most voracious reader busy. They tell the story of an Abbey of mice and woodland creatures and their struggles with the powers of the evil vermin. The stories range from adventure to action to romance to mystery to epic. If you read them, than tell other people about them. They lost a lot of publicity because of Harry Potter. They are some of the best books I have ever read. I LOVE THEM 999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999 TIMES MORE THAN HARRY POTTER! READ THEM OR MISS OUT ON THESE PERFECT BOOKS!"
5,Loved it!,I've always loved Brian Jacques style. He always ends up amazing me with his humor and and wit. The action is always five star and the characters blow your mind away. Redwall!!!
5,This is the first book of a great series!,This is a tale of a bumbling young mouse named Matthias (whose sandals are too big!) who becomes a great hero during wartime.
4,"A Charming, Well-Written Tale","I thoroughly enjoyed this novel! The protagonists are charming and loveable; the villains are well-written, and their actions--rather than just hearsay--make them formidable. Although it's technically a children's book, as an adult, I was still able to appreciate it. I'm currently reading the second book in the series because I adored this one."
5,READ IT!,"This is a great book. I really love it. If you like King Arthur and Chronicles of Narnia, you'll like this book. It is way better than Lord of the Rings. READ IT!"
4,Redwall 1,"I enjoyed this book. The descriptions were very nice without dragging on&on. It was very easy to understand. I'm now reading Mossflower. I don't usually read books about animals, but a friend recommended it. You can always pretend they're people."
4,REDWALL---READ IT!,"Redwall is the story of Mathias,a smal mouse with larger dreams. He wants to be like his hero, Martin the warrior, who once defended Redwall. Mathias ends up getting that wish and in turn becomes a hero too. This is a very entertaining book and if you are into the whole ""Lord of the Rings"" thing this book is right for you. It has action, suspense, and is funny too. Try this book and i know you'll be as happy as I was reading it."
3,Unforgiving target age.,"I realize that Redwall is intended for those under the age of 13, but I don't necessarily think that should exlude the rest of us from enjoying the book. Either I am overestimating the literary capabilities of children or Jacques is underestimating them, because this book seems like it would be more appropriate for 7-9 year olds with the exception of its length. I did read the book in a day, so it is enjoyable, I just wish that Jacques would've at least thrown in a few subtle adult themes or concepts for us more sophisticated (yeah righ!) readers to gnaw upon."
5,Redwall,"This was the first Redwall book I read. It was very good, and Jacques depicts his characters very well, adding each one it's own personality. My favorite character's Basil Stag Hare, and I laughed several times over his crazy, stupid antics. Brian's other Redwall books are spectacular too, some even better than this one!"
5,It is wonderful book.,This a fresh and wonderful way to spend some reading time. I just founds the books and can't put them down.
4,Redwall,"First of all let me say I quite enjoyed the book. If you are completely new to the Redwall series you should know that it is basically an epic tale about war between several types of animals. This is in every book in the Redwall Series!Now you shouldn't shun this book just because it deals with a slightly childish topic. All characters have a near human personality and either have your heartfelt compassion or solid dislike. Now I don't want to go into to much detail, but the story follows the general plot of everyone being happy, bad things happen, good vs. bad, good guys win. The book also has a few flaws. The story has a sort of repeating tone to it, meaning that is sometimes gets a little boring.Overall I gave this book a 4/5 since it is intriguing yet dull in certain areas. Check out the book for yourself and see how you like it."
3,Redwall,"The story of Redwall, by Brian Jaques, was very baffling to me. Redwall is the kind of book that doesn't appeal to me much, and books similar to that, I don't enjoy reading. Since this was a class book that we had to read, I tried to get into what its meaning was. I would recommend this book to my friends only if they like to read adventure books. Otherwise, I would recommend a different type of book for them to read. The only good part in Redwall was when Matthias got captured by the sparrows and held prisoner while trying to figure out where the sword of Martin the Warrior was hidden. If I were give this book a grade out of five stars, I would give it three stars."
2,"Rather unimpressive, actually.","Sure, the ""Redwall"" series is well-written, and unusual in its use of animal characters rather than humans. That does nothing to alleviate the fact that the plots are all the same as any other epic sword quest. The characters are flat and stereotypical, and the conflicts wrap up a little too neatly. I read the first two books in the series, but I don't think I'll be coming back for more."
5,great book!,"I read this book based on an enthusiastic recommendation. And I am so glad I did. I'm now a happy fan of Brian Jacques and the entire Redwall series.The story moves along very nicely, with good editing and excellent characters. I found myself reading late into the night just to see what happens to them and how it ends. The only warning I have is to be prepared to be hungry! The feasts are described in wonderful detail with great imagery and colorful conversations. It's very reminiscent of holiday gatherings and family dinners from childhood.This book impressed me. I know it was written for children, but it absolutely does not read like one. I can see why younger readers would enjoy it, but adults will love it too. It would be a great book to read aloud or just keep it to yourself.Enjoy!"
1,Boreing,"I read the first page and got bored. Why is everyone saying this is GREAT? It's HORRIBLE. Of course I only read the first page. But, it didn't make sense what was going on! Boring."
5,Redwall-A GREAT Book,"I think that this book deserves 5 STARS!! It is a great book that is a classic. Brian Jacques is a great writer, with a wild imagination. It is a book that keeps you on the edge of your seat, right to the very end. It was extremely hard for me to put down. He gives you vivid pictures in your head, which makes it even better. This book is a must have for your bookshelf.He divides the story into several little storys. You follow different characters through their hardships and accomplishments. You get attached to a character and hope they make it through. The epic adventure is a battle of life or death. It is a compelling novel. I think it deserves 5 stars."
5,I'm just started reading it.....so far it's pretty good,"Redwall is just like a medevil story, except it is played by mice, and rats. You'll meet the young mouse, Matthias, at the begginning of the story, and sooner in the story, he becomes a hero to mossflower. I reccomend this book to 5th or 6th graders who like medevil stories."
5,Possibly the best.,"This is a great book. A belivable head villan... main characters you can relate to...no 500 characters to keep track of... the list goes on. This book has action. It has a storyline. It has a huge crossbow. I'm not very good at humor. This book is good. Like most firsts, it ranks at the top, with muddy sequels following. It is incredibly descriptive, with a spectacular end battle that occupies a larger space than most of the other books in the Redwall series. The different storylines twist and turn all over the place, eventually coming together at the end. It is gorier and more vilont than the later Redwall books, but that doesn't bother me. READ THIS BOOK."
5,"Ray of hope in the current climate of ""big bad banks""","This is a great ""blow by blow"" detail of the rise of America's oldest and largest ""community development bank,"" which took an early and activist stand against the practice of racial ""red-lining"" and for the Community Reinvestment Act. The Bank also served as the model for the Community Development Financial Institution Act of the Clinton Administration, which sought to replicate the premise of community-based financial institutions as a tool for reinvesting in struggling and/or marginalized communities. The honest account of the successes as well as the failures of the SouthShore Bank (now just ShoreBank), is a must read for any serious student of community development, or concerned citizen seeking a more grounded understanding of the true nature of the current financial crisis and one possible path to recovery."
3,"worth buying, BUT","There is no doubt that Amel is one of the best vocalists out there, however a voice cannot carry an album on it's own. The production is not up to par, however maybe that's me remembering the sounds of Groove theory and how much I enjoyed the blend of beats and a quality voice. The sound on the whole doesn't give me shivers like I expected it to. Overall a good album, but I don't think it will get much play in my CD player. There's just no authority in the music."
4,A must have,"If you like the smooth grooves of Erykah Badu, the feeling and passion of Maxwell and Will Downey, and rich sounds similar to Sade, this album is for you. I bought the CD because I loved the first single ""Get up"" but that song is only scratching the surface of the talent that this former Groove Theory member possesses. If you are tired of typical R and B, and have elevated to a higher standard, I would highly recommend this album. Perfect addition to a candlelight dinner or while reflecting over life in a hot bubblebath."
4,Still Groovy As A Solo Artist,"This album from Amel Larrieux puts her in a positive class by herself, and it was well worth the buy for me and for anyone who heeds motivation, relaxation, and mutual luvin'."
4,The Possibilities are Endless!,"I 1st heard Amel back in '95 when she was with Groove Theory. Now some five years latter she drops her solo LP that has a different groove than what she had going on back in the day, but it still flows. My favorite track is the title track, and INI. Amel as created something that is different from the standard that we are so used to hearing these days, and I truly thank her for that. Infinite Possibilities is a CD worth checking out. Peace & Blessings!"
3,"Worth the wait, I guess","The master wasn't so hot; not much better than the crappy VHS copy I had. But it works, and no tracking worries.The packaging is amateurish, with a misspelling or two and completely misleading cover art.The disk menu is bare-bones with no extra features.I wouldn't have wanted to pay much more for this, long wait or not, but I'm satisfied."
5,Truely Amazing,"chrles owens from Bankok, thailand hit the nail right on the head. The concept was that there are so many movie soundtracks available that have absolutely nothing to do with the actual movie. They're just made to advertise new bands. This record is a soundtrack that has everything to do with the movie, yet it doens't exist. The movie unfolds in your mind as you listen to the album."
5,This Version of Henry V is number one in quality,"Excellent movie! One that portrays the delicate balance of idealism through the ying and the yang of life. Kenneth Brannaugh portrays Henry the Vth with great generosity and complexity as the formerly unproven young royal who, when tested, proves that he has the inner strength to become an inspirational king and earn his people's love. The balance of idealism continues throughout the movie in all areas, even including the battle scenes. As an example, Henry and his men become engaged in the realistically portrayed and very brutal Battle of Agincourt. Immediately after the battle, the movie reflects upon the reality of dealing with the loss of lives with quiet dignity. This is such a fantastic production that I truly believe that there can never be any version of this play made that could possibly be any better. This movie is absolute perfection. Buy it, watch it several times and always enjoy it!"
5,An absolute must for any Shakespeare collection,"I'm going to agree with the review that says this is the greatest Shakespeare adaptation ever put to film. Kenneth Branagh was absolutely brilliant--not only as an actor, but as a director and screenwriter. If you only see one Shakespeare movie, this is the one to see."
2,Great Movie-Why aren't there english subtitles! -DVD review,"Spanish is my native tongue, but I try to learn as much english as I can, I've been taking classes for about 10 years out of my 15 years of life and I always put the english subtitles while watching a DVD (which has english audio) and I found that this DVD has subtitles in spanish and in french but not in english! I gave it 1 extra star because it has spanish subtitles."
3,"Great Film, Less than Great Transfer","Kenneth Branagh's splendid Henry V is the best Shakespeare film of the last forty years. Unfortunately, the picture quality of this DVD is only so-so. MGM really needs to do a better job than this."
2,So wanted it to be wonderful!,"I love this movie and use it annually with my students to bring Shakespeare to life for them, but with a realistic slant. I purchased the DVD version in order to be able to project it, but on the item I received the sound quality was poor and returns once the seal is broken is not an option."
1,What's up?,Our son had the role of Henry V in Shakespeare in the Park last summer. Hadn't seen the play since college. Ordered the DVD with Kenneth Branagh in the lead role. Was informed they were out of stock. They's ship it when more copies arrived. I'm still waiting...
2,A frustration for the hard-of-hearing,"I have waited a long time to watch this movie. Imagine my disappointment when I found no Closed Captioning or English subtitles. I am hard of hearing, and lack of captioning forced me to turn the movie off in frustration within 10 minutes.How much trouble can it be to offer this simple thing that would make a movie accessible to those with hearing loss? Thumbs down to those who exclude us.I will take the word of others that this is a very fine movie, but I sure would have liked to find out for myself."
3,Henry V,"The film is wonderful. The sound track is superb. However, the DVD was supposed to come with a booklet but didn't. It would have been helpful in following the story line and understanding the British language. Shakespeare isn't easy to grasp."
5,A masterpiece!,Branagh's Henry is a triumph. I found it to be more real and inspiring than Olivier's.
1,peice of crap,"i ahv recently not bought but downloaded this book, and still i erased it so that my mind would not explode with stupidity"
2,Listen before you pay for it,"To my ear, this is one of the most overrated albums I have heard. Not that it's bad. It's just all right. There is simply nothing here that merits the gushing accolades many of Buckley's fans heap upon it. Or maybe I just don't connect with it. After repeated listenings. If you can get your hands on a copy, you'd do well to listen to it before buying your own based on its hype. You may becomes as enamored as many others have. You find find it so-so as I do. Or you may even fall into the category with several people I know who find it to be unbearably boring."
2,I Don't Get It,"Sorry folks. The guy is dead I know. I read all the reviews thinking this was going to be one to add to the CD collection.. and I was truly disappointed. I appreciate great ballads, screaming,wailing, depths of despair stuff.. but, this guy's voice did nothing for me....It was irritating in fact.The tracks.. one after another are moaning, groaning, wailing, monotone, relentlessly boring and morose.Sorry but this was a waste of money built on a great amount of hype, and rather than feel a grand catharsis after listening to it, I almost opened a vein myself."
2,One Good Song,I bought this CD because I heard the song Halleluiah on the movie The Edukators (pretty good movie) and the show House it is one of the most beautiful songs I have ever heard. Unfortunantly the rest of the CD just doesn't live up to it.
2,A good start,"I really wanted to like this. I've heard so many people gush over Jeff Buckley and how wonderful he is and how I absolutely *must* get this album. I even pretended to like it, because I felt like I ought to. But, well, I don't. There's some good stuff here, but, having listened to so much of Tim Buckley's music, I can't help feeling what Jeff did was only a good start. Tim really knew his voice and did some amazing things with it. Jeff was a good interpreter of others' songs, but he hadn't quite arrived as a songwriter. Tim, of course, wrote his share of duds, but he wrote some wonderful songs, too. And his best ones sound effortless, which is more than you can say for Grace. Sketches... shows Jeff moving in a really interesting direction, and it's unfortunate we'll never see him fulfill his potential."
5,Poetry...,"A friend recommended this to me. Never really listened to Jeff Buckley before, but I am now a huge fan. Definitely get the Legacy Edition. A beautiful album packed with so much emotion...a new favorite in my collection."
4,My personal opinion,"I bought this CD for ONE song....Halleluah...however you spell it. :) I LOVE that song. My husband, on the other hand, cannot stand the cd. I think it is well done and really enjoy it. :)"
3,"The songs are beautiful, but not quite to my taste...","I was originally interested in the song ""So Real,"" but since the whole album was only $2.99 and the clips from the other songs seemed pretty cool I figured why not. The music is really pretty and the sound is sweet (I don't mean that in the ""Dude! Sweet!"" kind of way) but they're not quite my taste."
5,JEFF BUCKLEY~GRACE,One of my favorite albums....I have so many memories tied to it! He is such an awesome artist! Wish he could still be here to continue to share his talents!!!
5,I can't turn it off,This is the best CD that I've ever come in contact with- hands down. It moves me each and every time I turn it on. If only he were still here...
5,A Powerful Distillation of the Human Soul,Jeff Buckley is a unique performer. His intuitive musical gifts are unparalleled. I can't think of another artist (with the possible exception of Billi Holliday) who so truthfully expresses the passions of the human soul. I get chills up and down my spine every time I listen to this album.
5,Ghostly shadows swirl,You can feel him listening to this record with you. The voice...the passion...the tragedy. My goodness this performance is what music is and has always been about...great artist gone before his time. The music is heartwrenching and classic.T8
5,Perfection.,"If I had to pick one CD to take with me to a far off deserted island, this would be it. His version of ""Hallelujah"" is now considered definitive, with good reason, too. If this CD doesn't move you it's a pity because you are missing out on something truly wonderful."
4,I can't believe,"the short review by the person who said that Jeff Buckley's ""Grace"" was everything that is wrong with music today. Au contraire, it is everything that is beautiful and right and true and pure and honest and . . . you get the picture. This cd is incredible, and it continues to grow on me. I've had it playing consistently since I bought it a week ago. Buy it and experience the beauty."
5,Almost too beautiful to listen to,"In my 10 desert island discs, this would be number 1....this man was an angel sent from heaven to give us ""Grace"". You simply can not listen to the song ""Hallelujah"" without being completely shattered and blown away. The single most beautiful song I've ever heard and I've been listening to music for over 45 years......forget about 5 stars, this album represents 50 stars!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Greatest male singer ever........"
1,Atrocious,Only one word can describe this album-- Atrocious. Jeff Buckley?? Ha--more like Jeff Suckley.
3,Maybe the most overrated album of all time,"What am I missing on this one? I have tried to listen to this several times, and, other than his version of Hallelujah (which is fabulous) this is very average and bland."
2,Not what I expected AT ALL,"I bought this basically because Hallelujah is such an amazing song for his phenomenal voice. I thoughtwrongly that the other songs on here would be similar in nature. Well there are one or two that are sort of similar,but mostly the songs, while showing his vocal range, are like 70's prog rock or something. I didn't like them at all.I'm very very bummed about this purchase, I should have listened to more snippets of songs before I bought it.I still love his voice, the guy sings like an angel, but these songs in my opinion are not the best showcase for it."
3,"This book has some great ides in it, butttttt",The home work was not done 100% for this book.The main theme of the book is the 150 attack and the Barry Attack. Now the Barry Attack is a facinating idea vs Grunfeld and Kings Indian Players.The problem of the book it does not mention the main line of the Barry I feel. 1.d4 Nf6 2.Nf3 g6 3.Nc3 d5 4.Bf4 Bg7 5.e3 0-06.Be2 c5 7.d:c Qa5 8.Nd2 Now why this book does not mention this line of the Barry is just beyond me. I feel this is by far whites best way of getting an advantage. Not the Ne5 stuff the book suggests.But the book has some awesome ideas in it! But you need to study them on your own from other sources.
5,This Book is Great,Okay You are a kid who is at is grandmom's house and your grandmom lives by a cemetry the tombsones there are moving.And you start to see ghosts.Before you get a good ending you'll have died at least 3 times unless you get very lucky. I don't want to spoil anymore of the plotline. Anyway read this it is great one of the best you choose the scare books.
5,Objective & Unbiased,"This book is outstanding. I really appreciate the unbiased and objective content that the author has written. All too often, books on this subject are biased and lack solid facts. Also, the book is easy to read, as the author placed side notes in the margins describing the subject matter as well as highlighting points. Regardless of where one stands on the issue of gun control, etc, this is a worthwhile read, and it is the best book I have read on the subject."
3,Cellar Tags not quite what you expect,"This product I am rating as just ""ok"". The package says there is a 100 tags yet actually the seller sends you (2)two packs of 50, no big deal in my opinion just be aware that will be what you get. What I don't really care for is the pen that comes with it really smears easily until it dries on the mylar tags so you have to be precise with what you write and not put too much pressure on the pen. I would buy more of these but I think I am going to find a better pen for them next time."
3,"Not their best effort, but great black metal nonetheless.","Immortal is one of my favorite black metal bands. This album is raw agression with just the right amount of lo-fi production that we've come to expect in the black metal biz. Not as good as some of their other efforts, like Sons of Northern Darkness and At the Heart of Winter (my personal favorite). Immortal fans should not overlook this, and black metal fans should hear the samples and make your own decision. Fast and furious machine gun/blast beat drums, rhythmic guitar work, typical black metal vocals. UP THE IRONS!"
4,morbid angel meets sodom,"The speed and blasting drum beats & the old school death tortured vocals works well for this band. It was a truly enjoyable listening experience, w/out the screeching vocals of most black metal bands. If your into a fast, heavy, & yet tight music than you should purchase blizzard beasts...will take you back to your old thrash/death metal days."
4,Morbid Angel played at double speed....,"This is basically a Morbid Angel CD played at double speed...""Blizzard Beasts"" is sort of a ""transitional"" CD for Immortal, combining the cold, frosty old-school black metal sound of ""Battles in the North"" and ""Pure Holocaust"" with the more crunchy well-produced death metal sound of later CD's as ""At the heart of winter"" and ""Damned in black""Maybe ""black metal puritans"" will prefer the earlier CD's and new fans of Immortal prefer the new more polished, mid-tempo approach, but I think ""Blizzard Beasts"" is the perfect mix of the two, and therefore Immortal's best album in my oppinion..The almost Fields of the Nephilim sounding track ""Mountains of might"" is the album's highpoint, although it is the least representative, because the rest of the tracks are played at breakneck speeds!!Credit has to go to new drummer Horgh for his incredible stamina and energy, which seem to charge up the rest of the band."
2,Okay Boom box,We received this unit with one of the meter level not working. We called the manufacturer for them to repair it. They asked us to send it at our own expense which will total $15. What a joke. The unit 2days old was still under warranty. Never again to deal with this PHILIPS manufacturer.
5,Wordy and depressing teens.,"Dawson's Creek - The Complete First Season had me swooning over the friendship and future relationship of Dawson and Joey. I admit this show gets on my nerves every now and then but this teen soap is quite engaging. Seasons 1 and 2 are my favorite of the six-year series. Good show but highly overblown, have fun with this guilty pleasure!"
5,Dawson's Creek - Season 1 is the best dvd I have ever owned.,"I love this dvd! It is truley the best dvd I have ever owned and totally worth the money. I watch it all the time. Besides 13 episodes, there are extras on the dvd that have commentaries from Kevin Williamson, the cast, and much more.I can't wait to buy the next 5 seasons!"
5,Best Show Ever,Let me just tell you i stayed up all night watching the whole season...best show in the world
1,If only it didn't jam,"That's my main problem with this printer is it jams...a LOT. The mechanism where the paper is put into the printer keeps jamming intentionally, I don't get why it consistently does it. Plain and simple, if it didn't jam, I'd give it a 4. But this is beyond ridiculous, don't bother with this piece of junk."
2,"OK Printing, Eats Ink, Faulty at times","Bought the printer because a relative had had great experiences with PIXMA printer/scanner combos. Scanner works like a charm. Printer is an ink hound. I went through my black ink within 4 weeks of moderate printing. I printed no more than 150 pages. Printer broke on me by telling me that the feeder was ""jammed"" when in fact there was not one shred of paper in the machine. I must say, Canon customer service on the phone was very helpful and responsive and is in the process of mailing me a replacement(refurbished) printer. They weren't painful about it at all. That said, I'm not too happy the printer broke down. Print quality was a 7-8 on a scale of 1-10. Not as crisp as I've seen, but not terrible at all. Color printing was terrific, ironically enough, but that too sucks up a lot of ink. Speed was not painful at all."
1,Part of Ink Jet Scam,"I'm so sorry to see Canon go down this road.The printer exists to sell inkjet cartridges. You can't use your own or refill them (they have a security sensor so that you have buy new ones).Worst of all, if either of the inkjet cartridges is low (they'll run out whether you use them or not, just because they are opened) THE REST OF THE UNIT SHUTS DOWN.That's right - you are not allowed to use the scanner if the inkjet cartridges are low! (No, scanners don't need ink.)There's lots online about the way certain printer companies have designed their units to force purchasing of expensive ink cartridges. I didn't think Canon was among them, but apparently they are."
1,found it in the trash,I found my mp210 in the trash. It won't load the gosh darn paper. But the scanner works! Thanks Canon for making a product destined for the dumpster. I have a decent scanner now and it didn't cost me a dime.
2,eats ink,"Good for scanning, print quality is average. Previously owned an HP printer, which was bulker, so I bought this printer because it was more stream-lined. They also had a special deal on it when we bought our computer. However, it eats ink much more than the HP. Also the ink for the Cannon is harder to find in stores, and is more costly than other brands. I bought ink for this printer about a month ago, after using the printer for two weeks, the low ink display came on. It kept showing this everytime I would print. Two weeks later since the first display came on, the ink is now completly empty. Typically we print about ten pages a week. The HP printer was more expensive, but the ink was less, and the Cannon was cheaper and the ink is more. Maybe that is the trade off."
1,Canon Pixma MP,I love the Canon Pixma MP and have used it for year but recently it broke and will be $45 to fix so I found one on Amazon and it looked good although not new. I came well packaged and after I bought new ink (disappointed I could not use the ones from the old machine) it was good to go except it does not feed properly. It is unusable. I guess that is what I get for purchasing a used printer.
5,Life Is Short - Read This Book!,"Filled with time honored wisdom for creating a full rich experience of life, this little book is written with such fresh enthusiasm you'll feel as if you have your own cheer leader and personal spiritual advisor rolled into one.I gave it 5 stars because I think anyone would get 5 stars of values added to his life from reading it."
2,not comprehensive enough,"The dictionary is not comprehensive enough, especially to the one whose english is not the first language."
2,Mein Kampf,Thought this might be an interesting insight into such a twisted man. Incredibly dull and boring. I read it for about two hours and noticed I had completed 6% of it (Kindle version). Not worth the time.
1,"If not for its infamous author, this book would not sell.","The reason I started Mein Kampf was because I wanted to look inside the mind of Adolf Hitler. I never did finish the book and I found it infinitely boring. There is no emotion in it! It's like reading a newspaper. Furthermore, it is inaccurate. Hitler is usually about a year or two off with his dates, according to other biographies of him I have read. By the way, the book was not written, it was dictated to Rudolf Hess while Hitler was in prison. Makes me wonder if it would be any different, like were there some things that Hitler didn't want to tell Hess? Maybe I'm just too young."
5,JRR TOLKIEN makes his mark in the field of Fantasy,"The Hobbit is an excellent work of fiction. However, many believe Tolkien's masterpiece was brought on by his severe heroin addiction. Clearly Bilbo Baggins is what he views himself as,a dillusional 3 foot tall man. Heroin makes addicts feel as if they shrink, and become thieves, stealing from loved ones to pay for their costly habit. When Bilbo steals the ring of invisibility, it's clear that he feels himself as invisible to his wife. I suggest marijuana."
1,mein kampf,"this book is a book from some person, what the world seems as a bad person. In the most way i agree with is, but not with some things. Cultures are different, there are so many people on this world, with differend looks and looking into the world. Also is there a different between strong and weakniss people. We most protect weakness from the strongest. but also protect cultures and not become on big family. Let every land hold his culture, it is nice to go on vacation and to see the differences with your own land."
1,worse than c-span,"this book is a diatribe and its really boring.he is like someone who has the basics of something downbut kind of has missed the whole point. in this casethat something would be logic and reasoning.however, if you want to find out some reasons behindwhy the guy is so screwed in the head, you can readbetween the lines here and figure it out.he was a loser, complete unwanted, germany was indepression, no jobs, no nothing, and this dumb@#$@#$ decided he wanted to do something about it....by killing millions of people and invading other countries.also its funny to read about how he admired henryford for being anti-semitic. gosh i thought americawas anti-hitler from the start, what with all theindiana jones and john wayne movies i have seen over the years."
4,Mein Kampf,"I am in the process of reading Mein Kampf and am nearing the end. I have found that the book is useful for the purposes of understanding Adolf Hitler as a person. I have also found out by reading the book that Adolf Hitler was not a hypocrit, and nearly all ramblings on did come to light.In addition, I felt that the most interesting thing about the book was that Hitler knew that in order to have a National Socialist State he needed to introduce his policies to every person by making them first nature to all Germans and so that they, particularly younger people, would know little different. In effect, it would be the uniting foundation to their existence, all sharing and striving for one ideal over personal greed. These are just the hollow ideas, not the reality as it turned out."
4,history buff,"My husband was really impressed with the quality of this book! The green leather with the gold lettering looks classy. The only problem is that the printing is quite small, even with wearing glasses."
1,The thoughts of simple hate?,"When I read MEIN KAMPF(in the following MK) some weeks ago for the first time, I saw that all the trouble about this book is nothing but nonsense. MK is a book about the thoughts, ideology and fanatism of a man, whose horrible madness brought the second World War. I cannot understand, why a book like MK is a kind of bible for some people. It is terribly written, full of grammatical and orthographical errors; the most terrible German I have ever read. Because of being a history student, I can only see an advantage of reading this ""work of art""; only to understand the ideas that made the ideology of the WWII. This book is worth to be bought only, when the background is known. Without the background, this book is nothing but dirt, just the thoughts of a madman. The only right way to use this ""thing"" is to read it together with books like Winston Churchill's ""The Second World War"" and the Hitler biographies by Joachim Fest or Ian Kershaw."
4,Most Influencial Book Ever Read,"This book has got to be the most influencial book that one can read. I've read the entire book twice and i'm only 17. The idea's and ""ramblings"" as all you protalitariats call it would actually work. People should just give his book a chance in society today. It would be such a better place."
3,"Excelente calidad, para pasar un buen rato en familia","Muy buena calidad en todos los componentes de este clasico de Milton Bradley. Soy un gran fanatico de este juego, y si bien esta version es divertida, debo decir que las variaciones que sufrieron las reglas del juego no lo beneficiaron. Tengo la version de los 80 y me gustaba mucho mas como se desarrolla el juego que ahora en esta version. Se elimino el bono por el ""puente del peaje"", no hay mas ""balance de la vida"" con la posibilidad de ser ""magnate millonario"". Las apuestas sobre la regla numerada tambien fue eliminada... y asi otras cosas que hacian que este juego fuera tan entretenido y original. Si nunca jugaste otra version anterior compralo porque es bastante divertido, sino... keep your money."
1,Not your usual Laurell K Hamilton,"I am writing to warn first time readers of Laurell K.'s work. Do not read this one first! I am a huge fan and have been for years. I write the release dates of her new books on my calendar and MUST buy it on the day of release! This almost seems like a book intended for youth. (If not for the violence and gore.) I slugged through it for a week. I usually read her books, even the newest ones that topple 800 pages, in about 3 days. I had to make myself read this one. My advice for all of her fans is DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY OR TIME ON THIS BOOK!"
2,Hmmmm.... seems underdone,I have been a rabid reader of the Anita Blake series and picked up the Merry Gentry series later.. so when I saw another Laurell book I was delighted... As a book its not bad... not what I expected but not bad.. however when I got to the end.... it seemed to be not finished and I was wanting more completion with the story line... not bad but I wanted more of an end.
2,Where is the rest of the book?,I picked this up because I have read all of Hamilton's other work and really liked most of it. Though I think she went down hill when she decided half of her books should be describing intimate acts (see the second half of the Anita Blake series).This book did NOT meet my expectations. It started out well and I started to care about the different characters. The main character must begin to cope with her new found and poorly understood powers. Then it ended. I felt cheated.
1,A complete downer,"This is one of the worst books I've read in ages. I can't even think of any redeeming factors. The plot doesn't always make sense, there's no closure for the main character and it ends in a complete downer."
2,Not to good,I like Laurell K Hamilton but this book was not one of her better books. Didn't like the end at all.I always give her books a 5 star but not this one.
2,What????,"What was she thinking when she wrote the ending of this book? It was loosy. I love Laurell K. Hamilton her books are amazing i have read every book that she has written and they all were really good, but this book.. the beingging of the book was really interesting it had me wanting more. the plot was good and even the climax but were is the details? why didnt her healing work? what happened to the wife of ashe the undertaker? where did harkon come from why waz he so evil? what happened to all the main characters? all these questions are swimming in my brain and no way to get them answered. i still love Laurell she is one of my favorite aurthors but i wont be reading this book again and to all that are reading this reveiw do Not buy this book if you can rent it be my guest but the book had one of those horrible endings that make you mad. sorry but not worth the money."
4,Laurell K Hamilton does Dungeon and Dragons,"This dark and intriguing fantasy adventure romp set in the gothic/horror world of Ravenloft is a must-read for all Laurell K Hamilton fans. While it does not include her signature sex-spiced scenes, Death of a Darklord does introduce us to a woman who is fighting against all odds in a magical world that doesn't want her. Several plot twists and surprises will catch you off guard. It would be a 5 star book if it had a happy ending, but this IS Ravenloft after all..."
4,"Vikings, vikings, vikings...","I like Sandra Hill, she is always good for a funny light read. Kickbutt alpha heros, sometimes kickbutt alpha heroines. I like the fact that her ladies are not always teeny tiny...you know the ones barely 5 foot and so childlike in size. Why are all the tall men wasted on a short, short woman."
3,Overpriced video brochure,"I'm new to travel videos (Disney videos which I received free of charge upon request excepted) so I took that into consideration and gave three stars where my impulse was to give two. This video brochure skims the surface of Vancouver's main attractions - then repeats some of the footage to stretch it out. I expected much more for my twenty bucks: a bit of the history, maybe a few verbal exchanges, the sounds of the city, the sounds of the park, ANYthing to enable the viewer to connect with the place, rather than standard video footage with a voiceover from end to end."
1,Who drew this thing????,"I expected so much more based on previous reveiws (and price). This small book (yes, it has 163 pages, but it's only 5""x7"") has line drawings that are so crude and childish they are useless. Utterly useless. Since this book is about canine chiropractic--knowing specifically where and how you touch the dog is vital to doing the adjustment correctly. You can't tell what the drawings are attempting to convey and have to go solely by the text which is more detailed than the pictures, but I feel the book really needed both to be of any use."
1,Mel Ott: The Little Giant of Baseball,"Fred Stein did a terrific job of bringing Mel Ott to life with great stories of his entry into baseabll at the age of 16 and his subsequent rise to become a Hall of Famer . The Postal Service recently honored Mel Ott by issuing a commemorative stamp and named him one of the all time great sluggers. Stein depicts the era in which Ott, Terry and Mcgraw as manager of the NY GIants, played, as one of the most exciting times to witness the greats in action. Well done and a must for any baseball enthusiast."
2,"ok, too big and bulky","I wish it would have been thinner, the bottom is too thick to get under cookies, OK for cheesecakes."
5,Intriguing Dramatic Thriller,"My girlfriend and I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. We both like Gene Hackman for his versatilityat playing good, neutral, or evil roles. Of course in this movie he successfully portrays anenergetic and skillful law enforcement officer and body guard to a key prosecution witness.The movie has many plot turns and twists enough to keep one on their toes. It is often hard to tellwhich characters in the movie can be trusted and who are the hit-men/women out to KILL.This is an action oriented thriller that contains one of the better car (Bronco I believe) chase scenes.A helicopter with machinegunner chases the truck through the forest with amazing driving sequneces. A must see.I'm surprised this movie wasn't more popular and it certainly passsed me by when it first came out. Ilearned about it from the previews in another vhs movie.Highly recommended."
4,''You're tall'',"This classic piece of dialogue and what occurs straight after it mark one of the high points of this immensely satisfying thriller.Expert performances from Gene Hackman and Anne Archer as the pair in peril and a generally tense feel to the proceedings:both the heroes and the villains are racing to avoid each other,which they are doing at a fast pace,yet at the same time ,the train is also racing along,and I feel this is a clever and intriguing premise to work along.In fact,after 11 years,it still has the impressive thrill-factor required for a film of it's kind.Highly recommended."
5,Great flick.,This movie was great first time around and still holds that viewpoint. Hackman of course is the best. never disappointing.
1,Leave the Music Alone!,"I am just so upset that they decided to change so many of the songs for the dvds in order to make them more affordable. The music, to me, was a big part of what made some of the episodes so good. I counted and they changed 94 songs for the season 2 dvd set. No more ""Kiss the Rain"" by Billie Myers or ""Save Tonight"" by Eagle Eye Cherry, ""She's So High"" by Tal Bachman, or ""Shimmer"" by Shawn Mullins, among MANY others. It's terrible. So if you are just interested in the show and not so much the music, then you'll probably enjoy the set, but if the music is important at all and you already have the episodes on video tape, then DON'T BOTHER to get the dvd sets."
1,Sooooo angry...,"Season two was definitely the best season, don't get me wrong, but one of the things that made Dawson's Creek such an amazing show was it's music, and this DVD ruins that aspect of the show. I regret buying this DVD. I feel misled and wronged. The episodes are still great, so if you have never seen them before I'd still recommend getting them to see a great show, but as someone who saw it with the original music (and as someone who bought the DC soundtracks) I can't help but cringe when I hear what they have done to the music. It really does ruin it the whole thing. I will be sure to research future seasons when they come out and I will never buy another season that has been ""remixed."""
2,Best Hollywood Cheesey Steak,"This movie embarassed me. No joke, when Pacino gave the speech in the black church about the killing of the black boy, he out-blacked the blacks. Truly cringe inspiring. And the cliches! Only the credits stopped them. The predictability! Awesome, I felt as if I'd co-authored this piece of. I only kept watching out of a fascination with Pacino's rug and to see what other fine character actors would appear, only to be under-utilized and poorly directed."
4,Best process for removing labels I've found,"For the majority of paper labels, these work just great with a high percentage of success. I recommend them to anyone who wants to collect beer, wine and/or liquor labels.As others have stated, certain labels don't respond well to the remover adhesive - slick, shiny and/or metallic labels specifically. The second downside is the dollar per label price, which makes mistakes or large labels that require two removers a bit expensive.While these label removers are not perfect, they work better than any another process I've tried. They are the best available choice for removal of most labels."
3,Not quite fulfilling its potential,"Though genuinely humorous at times, Pushing Tin never quite lives up to its potential. Billy Bob Thornton and John Cusack give excellent performances as expected; but the story seems to fight with itself in a jolting, jarring, stop-start pace. The movie is well worth renting, (there is even some added humor for pilots/controllers) but is really not worth the purchase price. It should be enjoyed for what it is, a good two hour diversion; but should not have anything more expected of it."
2,Don't waste your time,"Sure, Pushing Tin has a great cast, but the script they're working with is flat at best. I kept waiting for the film to generate some energy or some thrills or some laughs, but it never happens. The sappy Hollywood loves-story ""lets make up"" ending is a real eye-roller. The DVD picture quality is first rate but apparently the studio didn't think the film was worthy of adding any extras."
4,Pushing Tin,"Having seen this film in a theater, I bought it for a friend who is an airline executive. It can be wonderful -- if a little scary -- for the frequent flyer."
3,like it for the air traffic control scenes; tolerate the rest,this was written by the brothers who wrote cheers and taxi so it should have been great and sometimes it is. all four leads do the best they can without much material. this could have been edgy but ultimately is formulaic...but the scenes about the job of being an air traffic controller will blow your mind.
3,Price Charming Is Not What It Seems...,"I probobly never would have known this book existed if i hadn't been wondering through a book store in my downtown area. Just looking at book after book is hard, trying to find something cute, but sassy...a good read for a 13 year old girl. I picked up this book and it may have been the sparkly cover that intreged me, but somehow I knew I had to have it. I started reading this book and it seemed pretty good and really funny. As it when on, it got a little boring and predictable. Also, their is some teen drinking in it and some suggestive content probobly a little old for young children. It's an all around good book with a picture perfect ending and a cute novel any pre-teen girl could relate to."
5,Humor and authentic drama blend in her struggle to adjust,"Melissa Kantor's If I Have A Wicked Stepmother, Where's My Prince? may have a strange title but the plot is indeed absorbing: teen Lucy's father remarries and their move from the West Coast to Long Island. Lucy gains two bratty stepsisters and a stepmother she isn't wild about - plus a new school with romantic complications. Humor and authentic drama blend in her struggle to adjust."
1,These are NOT Honeywell.,This is a generic product. The product description is deceptive. The Amazon and Honeywell lawyers should go after these guys.
5,EXCELLENT BOOK!!,"This is an excellent book. It outlines the responsibility of government to God and to His law. It also outlines the Christians obligation to both civil government and to the Law of Him who is the ""One Lawgiver."""
2,Orb fizzle out.,"There's really not much to cheer about with this album. Time seems to have left Orb behind. Gone is the long, spacey ambient flotation and we are left with music that is more dub with female vocals more than anything else. I don't like the feel of this record though there seems to be plenty of other reviewers who disagree. Can anybody really say they like the cover?"
1,IT AIN'T PRETTY ARTISAN!,ARTISAN loves to put out lousy substandard dvds and apparantly they think no one either notices or cares. Let's see...SLEEPLESS by DARIO ARGENTO...and this great movie JOHNNY HANDSOME which I WON'T BE BUYING until they put out a decent version. I was gonna buy this today as a matter of fact and immediately put it back when I saw it was full-screen. YAWN...wake up ARTISAN...please!!
2,Not the entire solos!,"Just based on what the ""look inside"" feature displays, these solos appear to be incomplete versions. The Andersen Scherzino that's the first solo in the book is actually only the much simpler middle part of that piece. The more technical parts of the solo at the beginning and the end are not there! This is fine -- if you know ahead of time what you're getting. I'd have been VERY annoyed to have bought this book (hoping for a piano accompaniment to the entire Scherzino), only to discover that the solo is incomplete!"
5,Fairy Girl,"Ella Enchanted is a moving, yet funny tale of a girl who wants nothing more than to gain her independence and freedom. A marvellous, imaginative version of the popular fairy tale Cinderella."
5,11 Year Old Reader,"Ella Enchanted is an awesome book filled with wonder, magic, adventure, and love. Ella is put under a curse to always be obediend by a crazy Fairy named Lucuinda. She wants to Marry Prince Charmont of Frell, but will she put him in danger?"
1,Complete Load of Crap,"I read this book. And when I finished this book I couldn't wait to get it back to the library. It was that bad! I think the author gave it the title Ella Enchanted to give it some kind of fantasy feel to it. You just had to sit back and say ""That's a complete load of crap"". It was not worth reading again! I was that bad."
3,"I enjoyed it, but I was also disappointed.","Ella Enchanted was one of the books that I read at the University this semester in my Children's Literature class. I enjoyed the book when I started reading it because it makes you think about what life would be like if you were under and obedience spell, but what disappointed me was the ending. It seems like the beginning of the book was full of details and that Gail Carson Levine needed a quick ending to this 232 page book. I think it ended somewhat like Cinderella. As I look back on the book, I see some similarities; Olga, her step-mother, Olive and Hattie, her step-sisters (Hattie is the one who knows about the spell and uses it to her advantage), dancing at the ball with Char (the Prince), and ending up happily ever after with him."
3,"Different from the movie obviously, but still good",It was entertaining enough to pass the time but don't expect it to be too memorable.
5,Ella Enchanted ROCKS!!!!!,"I really like this new twist of Cindrella! I don't like the fact that Dame Olga, Hattie, & Olive force Ella to be their slave! My friends & I read it all the time! Really good choice for girls & boys of all ages(that can read chapter books)!"
4,Better than the Movie,"Up until recently, I had only seen the movie staring Anne Hathaway. I was pleasantly surprised to read a story that was so far from the movie. I am a fan of J. R. R. Tolkien and enjoyed the fact that Gail Carson Levine created her own language for her characters in this novel. I also enjoyed all of the extras that came in the book. Most helpful was the dictionaries of Abdegi, Gnomic, Ogrese, Elfian, and Ayorthaian.I never get tired of hearing old fairy tales brought to life in new ways with clever retellings. This is a new and exciting way to read the story of Cinderella."
4,YAY! Finally!,"Wow!... I am a big reader, and I have read this book about 30times! I'm not kidding! It's a great book. The only thing is, itcould be written better. I mean, it's a great, wonderful absolutely fantastically imaginative book with a great plot and all that, but it could be kinda, oh, phrased better. If you want like better written books, go read something like Harry Potter (by the way those are good too). Other than that, I thought it was the best book of the... millenium! END"
5,A spectacular & intensely exciting book from start 2 finish!,"Gail Carson Levine creates a whimsical atmosphere by changing the character of the typical Cinderella to the personality of any normal human being burdened with obedience and an evil step-family. I loved seeing how clever, energetic Ella managed to make it through all the obstacles her curse created! This was an AWESOME book!"
5,My FAVORITE Book!,"Ella Encanted is a GREAT book about a girl named Ella who lives wth her mom, Lady Elanor, and the cook, Mandy. Her father, Sir Peter the trader, was away most of the time. When Ella was born, a fairy put a spell on her that made her always obedient. It was horrible, because when someone ordered her to do something, she had to do it. When her mother dies and her father marries Dame Olga, she meets Olga's fat, power-loving daughters. Hattie figures out that Ellaa is always obedient, and she uses the spell cruelly against her. Ella also meets Prince Charmont and becomes friends with him. Soon, Ella finds out that that loves her and would like to marry her, but if she marries him, she will put his life in danger. Find out what happens to Ella, her friends, and Char in this enchanting story."
5,I'm 16 and its my favorite book!,This book is so awesome! I love Cinderella stories but this has to be my all time favorite. I love how Ella is so spunky and crazy and how she can act so normal around the prince. I fell in love with Prince Charmont just reading about him! This book makes you feel like you are there and is so great! READ IT ASAP!
4,Ella Enchanted,"I found Ella Enchanted to be a wonderful children's novel. It is a fairytale about a girl, Ella who from birth is given the curse of obedience to every command. This novel takes the reader through her adventures of trying to break this awful curse of obedience that a fairy cast upon her. This novel is a great spin off the famous fairytale, Cinderella. All throughout the book it gives little hints about how Ella and Cinderella are similar.This novel is well written and can be enjoyed by all ages. The author paints a great picture for the reader causing a great suspension of disbelief. I think that there is a great plot and the storytelling is appropriate. I feel that these are just a few of the many good examples of why this is a great work of childrens literature."
5,Ella Enchanted me,"This book was breath taking. This was one of the best books i have ever read. Ella is the type of girl that just doesnt have the ""damsel in distress"" type of thing going for her.Sure like any girl she has her fair share of trouble, step sisters, step mom, callous fahter, loss of her mother, and an obdience curse upon her. This obdience curse was placed upon her as a child by the ditzy fairy lucinda. With the help of her charming best friend who is also her fairy/chef she tries to overcome this curse, and win the heart of the prince who already has hers. This book is the type of book where you can open up to any page and be captivated by the storyline,text,or trouble going on there. If you read this book you'll be as enchanted as I am every time i read it."
2,From good to bad,"This book started out excellent: It was the author's own idea; a good one at that. I was very interested in it. However, near the end of the book, it started to sound exactly like Cinderella. And I mean 'exactly'. It got boring. This is a good book for young readers, like, I'd say 8 and under."
2,Imagination problems?,"I think that this book was terribly unoriginal. It started out ok with Ella being forced to obey everyone but got lame with the stupid pumpkin carriage and so forth. It's ok for little second graders who like fairy tales like cinderella and other little kids, but not for anyone who knows how to appreciate REAL fantasy."
1,DO NOT GO IN THERE,"This Book was asighned to me for a book report. As soon as I got past 5 chapters I knew that this is a girls book. I had a hole month to read it but I barely finished it. I dont recomend this book for boys. My partners in this book report were two girls, they loved it. So boys take my advise Dont waist your money!"
5,The Narrator MAKES this audio book,"We listened to this audio book without having read the book or seen the movie previously. I didn't even know it was the Cinderella story until the middle of the story.Ella is the type of princess any mother might like her daughter to be. She is a great problem solver, a thinker, and yet she has a sense of humor. I love that she is always HERSELF, never putting on airs (unless the ""gift"" of obedience forces her to), etc.The reader in this audio book really enhances the experience. We felt it was Ella herself telling the story. This audio book made a long boring drive quite bearable. Much thanks to the author and the reader."
5,Cinderella Re-told,"This book was a wonderful retelling of the favorite classic, Cinderella. With magical ogres, fairies and elves, the story is dashed with exciting and lightening features. There is also a bit of romance to go along for the girl. There is still the evil step-sister and stepmother but there is a twist, a magical spell cast on Ella at birth with make it harder for her to mary her prince charming."
5,Cinderella Never Sounded So Heroic,"This is one of my all time favorite books. I first read it a looong time ago before Gail Carson Levine became famous and thought, "" Why don't people know about this book""Ella is a young rich girl. She knows that her mother loves her and father accepts her. almost. When she was born a fairy put a spell that she had to be obedient so if someones gives her an order she has to obey.When Ella is older her mother dies leaving her with her father. Eventually her father makes a bad business deal and has to marry a rich woman (with two horrible daughters) to have money. When he goes on business trips, Ella i turned into a servant.As the tradition Cinderella story, there is romance and magic involved, but i will reveal no more. This book was wonderful and i have read it many many times. I recommended it to kids (especially girls) of all ages."
4,wonderful!,"A review of Ella enchantedThis book is wonderful because of all the bizarre creatures (giants, ogres, elves and gnomes). I like all the courage of Ella when she faces the dangers, and I like the idea of the curse."
5,I loved it!,Even my dad and little brother liked this book. It is a must for every adult who loves a good fairytale.
5,"Enchanting, Enthralling, Delightful","I knew nothing about this book except that it had been made into a movie (that I have yet to see). It took me a good way through it to figure out that it was actually a version of a much older fairy tale--which greatly impressed me. Ella is completely herself and both unable and unwilling to depend upon such things as magic, ulitmately, to rescue herself. This is a fantastic book for young girls (and young boys if they are willing) but it certainly illustrates the power of one determined young girl."
2,Needs a mind of its own,I thought the beginning of the book was great. There were many details and lots of descriptive language. I had no idea where it was going to until about the last 5 chapters when i knew it was an almost complete replica of Cinderella. The ending shoud've ended more individual.
5,Ella Enchanted by Gail Carson Levine- Fantastic!,"I have no doubt at all that this book deserves a five-star rating. Ella Enchanted tells a new version of the old classic, ""Cinderella"". Ella is a young girl who was cursed at birth to always be obedient. She hates the ""gift"" and always tries to not fulfill the wishes of the person who gives her an order. An inspiring character, Ella shows that no matter what problems one faces it is possible to pull through.Ella befriends a prince, a kind girl with an amazing singing vioce, and a group of giants, all while trying to break the curse. It's not just friends that she finds, though. At the same time she makes enemies of a cruel and greedy woman and her two cruel and greedy daughters.If you like fantasy you will find yourself reading this story again and again as I did."
5,this movie is great,american pie was one of the funniest movies i have seen. you people that didnt like it are either a)women or b)old and dont remember what it was like back in the day. it was very funny and me (and all my friends) can relate to this movie 100%. go see it- you wont regret it.
3,I liked it more then,But now its ive gotten to old for this cheese but there's still a few good scenes. I enjoy Van Wilder more than this for late 90's earyy2k laughs but for $4.98 what the hay right. 3 stars max
2,Tolerable Teenage Hijinks,"Bottom line: This movie is a cliched teenage comedy. Thepremise is about as fresh as the idea of an escaped mental patientkilling sexually promiscuous teens. It's about a group of friends that vow to lose their virginity before prom night. Along the way, they get involved in some pretty outrageous situations. I know. It sounds like I've just described every teenage comedy from the last 40 years.But, I must say that the characters are very real and the performances by the young cast are good, as well. But the film has as many mis-fires as it does hits in the gag department. Plus, as a whole, it just doesn't hold up. But's it's okay to waste a little time on.Also, Eugene Levy delivers the most laughs as the father trying to deal with his teenage son, played by Emmy nominee Jason Biggs. END"
1,"Great, if you like obvious and childish sight gags","I believe this movie billed itself as ""This generation's Animal House"". It's been a while, but I seem to recall that John Landis, even at that early stage of his development, managed to balance a desire to challenge the sensibilities of those days without sinking to the obvious or cheap without some offsetting subtle gags. No such luck here. It's play for the ""quick and dirty"" laugh all the way.My fifteen year old asked me if he could see this picture and I replied in the negative. I wish I could say it was because the content and sophistication were beyond him. Rather, I was embarrassed as to what he might make of popular culture as we enter the new millenium.Save the money and get something more challenging and witty, like ""Dumb and Dumber"" or maybe ""South Park""."
4,"Sure it's sophomoric, but.......","I really liked this movie. No, it's not American Grafitti, or even Animal House (both of which I loved) but it is a cut above the normal teen party flick. There were some fairly realistic characters and I think that Eugene Levy, of SCTV fame, does an incredible job as the concerned (if a little bungling) father.The DVD has a clear anamorphic widescreen transfer, nice menus, and a decent array of extra content. The outtakes were a little stale, and the only thing that appeared to be different from the standard R-rated version was the location of the ""pie"" and the offending teen when caught in the act. Overall a nice package compared to the VHS version.My wife, who usually passes on this type of film, even enjoyed it."
5,American Pie-Sweet and Sour,"Though this movie maybe a little much for those with weak stomachs, this is definately a classic. One of the funniest movies I have seen of all time. Planning on renting a movie Friday night? Rent this! It's well worth it! Just DO NOT watch this with your parents or else plan to be embarrassed!"
4,"Funny, in a juvenile sort of way . . .","Ok, so I admit, this sort of juvenile humor makes me laugh. But letsget it straight: this is juvenile humor done right. It's stillimmature, but its timing is excellent and the casting is superb.I would strongly suggest you _don't_ watch this film with anystuck-up people around (friends, family) since you'll probably betoo embarrassed to laugh at certain spots ..."
1,Awful transfer!,"I have seen a lot of bad transfers from DVD to Blu Ray. But this one is by far the worst! Horrible sound and picture quality. Especially the sound. Universal really need to get their stuff together as far as their Blu Rays are concerned. Especially since this was the first time the American Pie trilogy is available on BR in North America. Big time let down in every way shape and form. Shame on you, Universal. Shame!"
4,Great tasteless comedy!,If you're like me and enjoy tasteless comedies like Kingpin or Baseketball then you will definitely enjoy this movie. However if you're in to the more critically acclaimed comedies like Election or Woody Allen movies then you may want to avoid it.
2,Not for mature adults,"Boys trying to lose their virginity, girls waiting for the right time, moment etc. The same old cat and mouse high school antics. The plot only deals with sex. Good ending though. This film is not for anyone under 16, or over 21. Though it has it's moments, (the laxative scene) a comedy it's not! It is a teeny porn film disguised as a comedy. If I were a 16-21 year old as opposed to a father with impressionable sons, this would be a great film. Although it's not graphic visually, the dialogue is very graphic. It could have been done more tastefully, and the message at the end would have had more effect."
2,A Porky's for the New Millenium,"If you think that's a recommendation, you will probably enjoy this obvious and amateurish movie. The second star is for Eugene Levy's funny performance as the the lead idiot's father, and for the storyline about the jock-turned-singer which was the only interesting part of the plot. Fast Times at Ridgemont High is still the best in this genre."
2,ha ha another one,"Another one of thoose movies that have the same dumb teen plot.But more graphic it reminds you of cant hardly wait' shes all that' fast times at ridgemont high ' its funny in some parts but at the end you wonder what was the whole point of the movie anyway. if u are in to premarital sex teen drinking and masturbation, you will love this low life film . stupid movie"
4,Adolescent,"Picture realistically depicts the wrestling match most adolescents involvethemselves in with sexual relations. Movie was well done technicallyand the actors were pretty believable; but the subject is one ofgrowth from immaturity, and the rating reflects this genre.Light weight, but how else could it have been done, given its goal?Bill SchaeferBerwyn, PA 19312...Rating: 4/5 7/10"
5,Very funny movie.,"This movie will become a classic, kind of like Porkies only funnier. It is one you could watch again and again and always laugh. There are some gross parts, but is a great movie."
5,"INNOCENT VERSION OF ""KIDS""","This film, although of very mundane and not-so-controversial theme nowadays, succeeded in its excitement through the dialogs, the actual suspense which intriegued the viewer to a certain point. Admittedly, not all scenes were as powerful as the first (innocent masturbation caught in the act by very conservative mother). All in all, far from a waste of money. A more sentimental approach to sex than the infamous ""KIDS"". Maybe we should be teaching sex ed to our parents and let them enjoy this teenage movie about real life adolescence?"
4,The Ultimate Movie Review! - [...] - @tss5078,"The original American Pie is certainly a classic comedy on the must see list, but it's not the best of the seven American Pie inspired films. Personally, I preferred the second one too the first, as everyone was much more relaxed and knew each other, making the movie flow better. Don't get me wrong, this one certainly had it's funny moments, but in my estimation it wasn't as good as the second one. Jason Biggs & Alyson Hannigan are hilarious, but for all they bring to the table, bad actors like Eddie Kay Thomas and Chris Klein take away, making the good performances moot. American Pie is a classic teen comedy about sex and it ushered in a new era in comedy that's still relevant today. It has the raunchy, crazy, good looking youth we see in today's comedy, but unfortunately also has some really lame jokes and bad acting, that thankful went out with the nineties."
4,Only one complaint,"As far as comedies go, ""American Pie"" was rich, humorous and touching in an unsentimental way. Still one can't watch a movie like this without feeling a sudden rush of empathy and a terrifying flashback to one's own awkward youth.Grotesque, hillarious, and highly original. I recommend this movie for all but the faint of heart."
4,why is it unrated?,"I liked the movie, but Im seriously wondering why this was a unrated version? It seemed like it was the same movie I saw at the movies."
5,Hi Hi Miss American Pie!,"I saw the uncut version of this move a couple of days ago on VHS, and I can honestly say, I have not laughed this much at a movie since South Park Bigger Longer and Uncut! I thought it was hilarous! I especially liked it when Jim got caught masturbating with the Apple pie and when his dad bought all those magazines for him! This movie is the best so far! And I strongly suggest that anyone who hasn't seen it, should!"
5,Prepare to become Obsessed with this Album!!!,"I wandered around my local record store one day waiting for something to jump up and grab me, when I heard Waltz #2 playing. I headed straight for the ""S"" aisle, picked up XO, and have never turned back. Elliott Smith is amazing. I force him on all of my friends, and they have all thanked me for it. This is one of those albums that digs right into you, and refuses to let you free of it. Nearly every song is a gem, and Smith's guitar playing is entrancing. If you like nuance, you'll love Elliott Smith! Also, if you can see him live, do not miss the opportunity. He's the sort of artist I hope never becomes a huge star (so we can enjoy small performances), but continues to write, record, and perform for years. XO is a genius album."
5,Whoa,"There are some albums that are good for using as background music, where the songs are pleasant, but fail to catch the ear of the listener. This however, is not one of those. Elliott Smith's songs grab your attention from the first few chords, and refuse to let go of you until the song is over. Many of these songs, like ""Oh Well, Okay"", and ""Pitseleh"" show evidence of Smith's depression, while others, like ""Tomorrow Tomorrow"" disguise his bleak lyrical phrases with soaring harmonies and bouncing guitar lines. This is perhaps Smith's saddest album, and possibly his best."
5,Beatlesque in a good way,"When I see the term ""beatlesque"" in a record review, I usually think of vocal harmonies and no kick. Smith has added just enough kick to keep this one interesting throughout. Beatles with a touch of Nirvana? Gets better with every listen. This is music a 40-something white guy can relate to."
2,"Vastly Inflated Prices, even by 2007 standards","I have multiple editions of this book, and I have always enjoyed them. However, after years of collecting autographs, I have come to the conclusion that the prices they list have no basis in reality. They are usually highly inflated. I would guess the prices are what dealers would like to get for their autographs, but I don't think they usually do."
1,what the...,"I saw the commercial for Kidz Bop (i lost 10 IQ points writing that) and I screamed bloody murder. What the [...] is wrong with these people? because....OMG BOULEVARD OF BROKEN DREAMS HAS A BAD WORD!!!!!WE'RE ALL GONNA DIE!!!!!! if you have kids under 8, who want ""adult"" music, but YOU don't want bad themes/words...get Hilary Duff.
