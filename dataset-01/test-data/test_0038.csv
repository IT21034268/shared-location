4,"Neutral and functional, but a little small.",Pretty and neutral enough to go with almost any decor. Would be great if it were a little larger.
3,KISS's last album without make-up...,"This album was a mix of swampy guitars, and demon sounding lyrics. The album has great lyrics like ""IT NEVER GOES AWAY"", ""I WILL BE THERE"", ""HATE"", ""RAIN"", ""JUNGLE"", ""MASTER & SLAVE"", and a suprising last song by Bruce Kulick on lead vocals on ""I WALK ALONE"", which is a great tune. This album is pure hard rock."
4,Certainly better than Psycho Circus,"This reminds me of my assesment of Paul Stanley's solo album: it's a shame there's only one album of it. Carnival Of Souls, Psycho Circus, and Music From The Elder are the only KISS albums that don't have ""let's bang right now"" lyrics. It's incredibly refreshing and it shows that KISS can write decent lyrics when they aren't obsessed with sex - which isn't necessarily bad.I believe that ""Childhood's End"" relates to Kurt Cobain's suicide, as Cobain *did* cover ""Do You Love Me"" when in Nirvana and was a child during KISS' popularity. ..... It is a rare treat to find KISS lyrics that tug at my curiousity."
5,Extremely different!,"Odd-time signatures (6/4) in ""In the Mirror"". Arabesque sounds in ""Seduction of the Innocent"". Tritones all over the place, vs. 2-3 chords in their regular repertoire. Very important topics in their lyrics. Leyends are made up of variety, of that ability to change styles within the blinking of an eye (e.g. The Beatles, The Doors, Led Zeppelin, Yes, et al). As with all musical leyends, KISS has tried many styles (disco, pop, orchestral arangements, country), and have succeeded in all of them. Trying alone should gain them enough respect!!! Many groups stay on the same 1 or 2 styles and after a while become boring and trite. KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK! Excelente!"
1,Darren d.,carnival of souls to me is bad i gave my cd away.IT`S Slow it just Don`t sound LIKE kiss.some may Like this cd but I did not. I SEE WHY THIS WAS THE FINAL SESSIONS. IT IS JUST BAD I DID NOT LIKE THIS CD. THANK YOU.
4,Best in quite awhile,"It seems this album is like (Music from) The Elder, in that KISS fans either love it or absolutely hate it. I think it's their most interesting album since Creatures of the Night. KISS are often accused of having tried too hard to make a grunge album with this one, but honestly, since when have they been ever been original? Gene Simmons' songs are his best in at least fifteen years."
4,kiss moves to seattle,"lets get right to it.this is kiss high on seattle grunge.and itt works.if you are a fan of the seattle scene theres something here for you.if your stricktly a kiss fan you might say""i never knew you had it in you"" a solid album by any means"
2,Kiss Does Black Sabbath?,"I love KISS, but I wonder what they were thinking here. If I wanna hear Black Sabbath that's what I'll listen to. This disk is heavy which is great but it's also slow which is very anti-Kiss. This was supposed to be a sister album to Revenge, but Revenge although different was still Kiss. By being Kiss I mean fun, fast, sing along, rock and roll. This is very plodding and methodical like most of the music from 93-97. Thank God grunge is pretty much over because all of that music was so unbelievably boring (yes let me be the first to say all of Pearl Jam's songs are boring). And unfortunately Kiss followed suit here."
4,Their weirdest album,"This album is even weirder than ""The Elder""... yes, it does have that grungy badmotorfinger vibe that I read on other reviews but this is hardly one of the weaker efforts. It's a bit of a letdown, musically speaking, that Gene & Paul decided to reunite with Ace & Peter because this album was taking them in a different direction and it would have been interesting to see where it would lead to. I am a diehard Kiss fan so I can't say I didn't want to see the big reunion happen but look where it's gone... NOWHERE. One ""reunion"" album (Psycho Circus) and they quit. If Eric and Bruce were still in the band they would definitely have been keeping this band rocking for more years to come. These days it's just Kiss Incorporated. Carnival of Souls will go down in Kisstory as a MASSIVELY overlooked album and that's really too bad because it stands as one of their best moments, ""bandwagon jumping"" and all(lighten up you other reviewers)"
2,Disappointing,"I'm glad to see I wasn't the only one ""tricked"" into thinking this was a full sized book. This book is ok for the principles and history, but I was looking for applying feng shui to my home, and out of 124 minature pages, there are very few pages on applying specific principles to your home."
1,Feng Shui for Dummies,"I was completely blown away when I opened my ""book."" At 3"" by 3"" it is a mini book at best. No where was that stated in the discription. It has some interesting info in, but come on, when I was expecting a full sized book, I was greatly disappointed."
1,Feng Shui,This is ridiculous! The book is only 3x3 inches at the most and I feel it was a ripoff. Save your money. This was a waste of time and money for me and I feel like pitching it out.
3,An entertaining movie that would have been better if a few scenes were cut. Never felt consistant. Worth a watch though. I say B,"""She wanted it, she told me to."" Catalina (Vega) and her escort friends are at a high end party when senator Bill Krebb (McDonald) goes to far and one of the girls ends up dead. Catalina takes the tape and runs. An assassin is hired to find her and and get the tape back. Catalina finds two private investigators who are just starting up to help her. This is a movie that was actually pretty good, but the big problem was that it was a little too long. There were some really exciting and fun action scenes and tense moments in this, but there were also some very slow paced and unnessecary scenes that slowed the movie down and kept it from being consistant the entire time. Equal parts action and comedy made it a fun watch, but nothing to rush out and see either. Overall, an entertaining movie that is worth watching once but that's about it. I give it a B."
2,wrong dvd,The first order I received did not contain the cds. The wrong order came in.. i reordered and the pkg was complete. There was a complete difference in the size of the container. So the problem was not with Amazon!
4,"""feels delicious""","They advertise on the front ""feels delicious"". The taste is not wonderful, but tolerable. The texture is, however, much better than KY. It is more comfortable & lasts longer than KY."
3,Dance Day Indeed,"I bought this b-side and rarities compilation to fill in the gaps in my Killing Joke collection. It also gives the vinyl versions I own a rest. The track listing is somewhat misleading as the track titled A New Day is actually the b-side Dance Day. Not a bad collection at all, but don't expect the version of A New Day with all of the vocals.Where's the song Flock the B Side you may ask? You'll have to buy the 2005 CD pressing of Ha! Killing Joke Live to get that one along with its wonderful a-side counterpart, Birds of a Feather. How about Pssyche, Follow the Leaders Dub or a handful of others? Try the box set Chaos for Breakfast for that. Poor completists. We'll keep shelling out money for the precious scraps."
5,Great entertainment and imagination,"The illustrations make this book come alive and provide the adults with some good belly laughs. You can feel yourself flying with Matthew and yelling ""whoa!!!"" as different pairs of wings take you on all kinds of unexpected rides. Great fun for everyone"
3,More of a step back than a new direction,"More of a step back than a new direction as compared to their last effort Blood, Sweat & Beer. It's not that it's a bad record, not at all. It's just that it's different. The band have taken a more unrefined and raw approach to their sound. The still keep their rock wits about them with songs about, chicks, drugs, and beer. I still can't believe that's Kory Clarke from Warrior Soul on vocals. This is not how I remember him. If you want to get down and dirty, Rock Did It is the way to go."
2,"Hot? Nah, not.","This has always been an odd album to me. It's not quite as awful as ""Crazy Nights"" or ""Animalize"", but it's nothing to write home about, either. HITS always came across as sounding like an album full of outtakes. A few tracks are actually pretty decent, for example, ""Betrayed"", ""Street Giveth"", but all in all it's sub-mediocre at best. To the band's credit, there are 16 tracks on this CD, though."
4,interesting read about an interesting era in america,"Perhaps I am not the best person to review this book as I am not a boxing fan at all, rather a person who appreciates good non-fiction and character studies. I picked up this book based on other reader reviews and the fact that that Time magazine named it the Best Nonfiction book of the year. The title of this book, as mentioned by other reviewers, is somewhat misleading as the book is only in part about Muhammad Ali. This book is more of a history about the era in which Ali became the champ. It is a well written account of Ali's association with the Black Muslim's and Malcolm X. It is also an informative account of the other famous fighters of his time and before. While the book is not a ""gripping"" book it certainly holds the interest of the reader. Surprisingly, after reading it I found myself less of a fan of Ali's than before,which may be the best evidence that the book is an honest account of the era."
5,"Good book, even if you don't like to read","This book I would recommend to all the people who either like boxing or Muhammed Ali. I would also recommend this to people who don't like to read because you would enjoy it and keep reading until its done. This book is about Ali at his best. From his childhood days to his greatest boxing match ever. This a nonfiction book that tells about Ali's career and the other boxers of his time, which include Floyd Patterson and Sonny Linston. Their fights took place in the 1960's. The best fight ever in this book was held in Miami Beach against Sonny Liston. This fight was exciting because Ali was the underdog of the fight and won it when Sonny Liston just gave up. The worst thing about this book is that it didn't fully describe all the other fights in his career."
5,The story of three boxers,"I can't believe it, a book that gets you cheering for Patterson over Liston, then Clay over Liston, then feeling bad for Liston as he meets Ali, and finally nervously cheering for Ali as he demolishes Patterson--only to eventually feel guilty for not having supported Patterson. This book really leads you through the early sixties from a unique stance. In short, this is a brilliant wonderful book that is well researched and superbly written."
1,Wrong Book,"I spent extra time and extra money making sure I didn't buy the ""brief update"" of this book, however when my shipment arrived it was not the book i thought i had bought--but the brief edition! The title and cover are completely different, even from the sticker on the back. I just kept the update version and resigned to paying extra attention in class because I was already getting my books late as it was."
2,Core Concepts in Health Science,I really needed that book but the seller told me that he had already sold it before and I guess that it wasn't removed from the page. I want to believe him. But my first expirience was very unflavored and some how sour.
2,White Pockets!!!!!,"Well I was going hiking and like to wear comfy sweatpants to rest and be warm afterwards. I got these fast from Amazon Prime -- put them on and yes they were comfy, fit great, the length was a bit long but that made me happy. THEY HAVE WHITE POCKETS!!!!! What is that -- so they are sadly going back -- White pockets -- no matter what you do they stick out. So I am going to order another brand and hope they don't have WHITE POCKETS!!! Who thought of that?????"
4,Comfy,"As you would expect, these are very comfortable - my husband's new retirement pants! Nice quality, and wash up well, but even though my husband is 6'2"", they are very long on him. I guess that's better than too short!"
1,Waist string broke after 9 days.,"What more can I say? When the waist string to tighten it breaks after scarcely using it more than a handful of times within a nine-day period, it's 1-star and back to Amazon with you."
3,Soft but leaves trail of fuzziness,"These were nice and soft... medium weight. However, after one wash cycle, they have been shedding little fuzzballs on my floors. I would think twice before buying another pair."
2,Pants are OK,"These pants are alright, but after running in them and washing them, the cotton on the pants starts to frazzle.UPDATE: After a few months the frazzling is worse and is happening all over the pants. I have a pair of Nike sweatpants and those are holding up better."
5,Nice pants,"These sweatpants are very nice. I like the open bottom, as opposed to the gathered leg openings of many sweatpants. These are much more modern-looking."
3,Don't rush to get this...,"Of course, the message of the boy who cried wolf is a classic for any childhood learning... but this book falls short of anything that I would consider to be a ""must have"". Glad that I checked it out vs. buying."
5,"97 minutes of nail-biting,palm sweating tension!!!","If you want your nerves wrenched and nails bitten to shreads, then you must prepare yourself to view this chilling HBO true story of nine West Ghanan stowaways bound for ""The Promised Land"" aboard a Russian Carco Ship in 1992.The very existence of these nine men posed such a threat to the future of the ship's future,the captain and the crew,that any measures had to be taken in order to squelch the men from being seen.Featuring a well-recognized cast including Omar Epps,Chiwetel Ejiofor and Joss Ackland,HBO showcases why, once again, they are the premiere organization to bring first-rate entertainment to the screen.THE ACTION AND TENSION NEVER LETS UP."
4,Cute forest animals,"You either like all the little pieces that comprise Playmobil toys, or you hate them. We like them, and this is a very cute selection of animals, along with their (tiny!) babies. The stump is removable so some of the animals can make a nest under it."
3,Judges,"Judges is a very unique film. Mixing in a comic book feel with Western and with an old fashioned story line of good vs evil. The actors were great, I especially liked DJ Perry because he carried a strong presence on screen and he played a suave character. The color schemes used in the film were perfect and it really caught my attention and the western music/the score & background music was just icing on the cake."
1,fake eau de cologne,I'm sad to say it but this item is a fake.After 40 years of shaving and spraying I can tell a difference.Silly me to believe that half-priced cologne can be anything but fake.No claims to Amazon.com though - my favored merchant of all time.
2,John Varvatos,This cologne in not too bad if it is applied very lightly. It has a hint of whatever scent that is used in ant spray.
4,Smells great,"Smelled this this while in a mall store on vacation, was concerned that it might not have e same smell or last a decent period of time. To put it simply, I'd buy it again."
4,Great perfume,"it is a great perfume, but no perfect. I am so happy with all experience, buying and the final product, I recommend 100%."
5,It is an excellent math workbook,"My daughter just finished this workbook.You may use division or algebra equation to solve some of the questions in this workbook, but you definitely can use very simple arithmetic methods as well. I think first graders or even kindergarteners may be able to solve most of the problems independently, but some of the problems in this workbook may need parent's help or hint. Overall, my daughter enjoyed this workbook, which is tasteful, interesting and challenging. I highly recommend it, rating it 5 stars, although there is one printing mistake on page 28, line 14: the first coin should be 5 cents instead of 1 cent. However, parents may not need to change this 1 cent because this printing error may make the question more challenging. If parents don't want to change this error, the answer will be 49 cents instead of 53 cents. I hope the publisher will notice this error."
4,Good but Somber,If you like said songs this it. Reminds me of a less thrash and more folk version of Nevermore. I like it personally and its much worthy of trying out.
4,As expected,"This item was significantly higher from authorized tool outlet for a 5 gas anylizer and is the same printer, just under a different number than CDX's numbering. Save yourself a few hundred dollars and buy through this avenue and avoid the tool peddlers."
3,MIKE DOESN'T LOOK LIKE MIKE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,WHERE IS HIS HOTNESS??????? HE DOESN'T LOOK CUTE AT ALL!!
3,"Not Bad, but Not Great","Han continues to deal with his internal pain, seemingly finally snapping in this book as he flies off on on his own adventure to help an old friend.The set up is pretty good, with Han taking on some different personality characterisitcs than normal, adding some variety to his well known behavior. He meets a new ally, Droma, who while interesting, is pretty two dimensional and will eventually get boring.Despite being an obvious set up for many events to come, the book still maintains its interest. You get to see some new Yuuzhan Vong ships and weapons, and the followed characters manage to get in trouble no matter which way they turn.While not the best of the New Jedi Order series, the book manages to keep you entertained throughout and is worth reading."
4,Han Solo fans rejoice!,"Although our favorite rogue turned hero has been missing in the last two New Jedi Order novels, he returns to the forefront and in great form. Finally coming to deal with the loss of Chewbacca and the rift that loss has created between him and his son Anakin.The Vong this time around try a more subdued attack rather than the brute force we have seen in the last several novels and once again are fleshed out with the new caste we see.I greatly enjoyed this book, and I am awaiting the next in the series happily!"
4,Great re-introduction of our beloved Han,"I'll keep this short and sweet because I don't want to spoil anything... I have never read any of Luceno's work, but he does a good job continuing the New Jedi Order series. Where the previous books were more directed towards the Jedi and their contributions towards this new enemy, Hero's Trial gives us a new respect and admiration towards our lovable hero, Han Solo. He has been sorely missed due to the death of Chewbacca and now has to overcome his grief and fight in the name of Chewie. Sometimes it seems as though Han could be ""Force-sensitive"" for all the situations that he seems to get himself in and out of... but, that's the Corellian luck for ya. Anyway, it was an excellent book with some great insights to the character of Han and how deep his relationship with Chewie really was. The rest of the cast is also built upon nicely which promises a great follow up in Jedi Eclipse. Happy Hunting!"
2,Disappointing,This was only the second Janet Dailey book I've read so I don't have much to compare it to. It was very hard to like or even care for these characters. I'm hoping the next story of hers I read is better or I will have to abandon the series.
3,not for small hands,I liked the idea of the velcro to hold the burger together. But once it is stacked its to thick.
5,something cool for avery hot summer,My granduaghter and daughter love it My daughter also has a new born and it allowed her to sit in it both her and the new baby and let everyone have a great time they love and the price was excellent
1,Hole/leak in seam in less than a week,"This pool could be fun if it was more durable. Mine developed a hole in less than a week of use. Holes in the seam dont seem to be able to be fixed with a patch. Also the seatbacks deflate with any pressure on them causing them to be uncomfortable, it would be nice if the seatbacks had their own seperate chambers like the seat bases do."
2,Weak Lining,"Lasted one season opened it up today, and there is a hole, and the screw set would not seal and leaked...Overal fun for one season only..."
2,Leaked on first use,"This pool leaked air from both chambers on first use. Within 1/2 hour of filling pool, air in top chamber had leaked to point it did not retain the water. Pool was not usable thereafter. The bottom chamber also leaked air to extent I did not have to be open valve when deflating. Now I have to fold up & return it. Would not purchase this brand again."
4,A Battle for Survival,"Giff Chesire is known to us who love old fashioned, classic, traditional westerns and indeed I was glad to see Leisure begin to publish his work in paperback after so many years of not being able to find his work. Too bad they made the decision to quit printing mass market books. But about this book, all three stories are worth the price and capture the intensity and drama of what it was like to live in the West, particularly the great northwest of Oregon, where Giff Chesire lived. These are good stories, written by a man who loved his craft and it shows. An excellent read."
5,Somebody Bring Me A Mirror !,"The Time without a doubt is one of the funkiest R&B groups to come out of Minnesota and the best side project Prince ever had a hand in. At only six tracks the disc can easily go toe-toe with most R&B discs released today. The huge hit 777-9311 is guaranteed to get an old school party started as is the self-explanatory dance song The Walk. Going with more epic jam-orientated songs through out the entire disc the group does plenty of partying. Fiannly Morris Day even manages to offer a respectable ballad with ""Gigolos Get Lonely Too"" which is just itching to be remade. The Time may not have been the most soulful band to come out of Minnesota that titles goes to Mint Condition but they sure are the funkiest."
5,It's Time 4 Another Party!,"The Time's self-titaled debut introduced the soundand now The Time have more involvment and it shows.""Wild And Loose"",""The Walk"" the the more Princely ""777-9311"" are uptempo,funky highlites,some short some not.""The Walk"" is the recordsmost swaggeringly humorous track with Morris Day and Monte Moir'scomic raps in the middle.""Onedayi'mgonnabesomebody"" is yet another new-wave interlude while ""Gigalo's Get Lonely Too"" surpasses the slow numbers on the debut.Impressively funky!"
5,R&B New Wave Minneapolis Funk at its best,"Okay, this album is just classic. It includes all the hits and it will make you dance forever. I mean how could you go wrong, this album is just great!!!!"
3,THE TIME,"I RECEIVED THIS CASSETTE IN GOOD CONDITION. I LIKE SEVERAL OF THE SONGS. MY FAVORITE IS ""WHAT TIME IS IT"",THE NAME OF THE CASSETTE. THE PRICE WAS GOOD. I RECOMMEND THIS CASSETTE."
5,Opened my eyes...,to how intricate a Filipino Wedding could be!It's a good read if you're interested in a culture laden catholic wedding!
2,Poor Sound Quality,"This recording sounds like it was made with a cassette player in a woman's purse from inside the bathroom. Ian Hunter is one of the greatest artists of all time, but the poor sound quality should have kept this from being released. For bootleggers only."
4,The Challenge of Christian Academia,"Sertillanges delivers the reader a concentrated dose of sound advice on how to understand and obey the call to Christian scholarship. In addition to pragmatic material on life as an Academic, the author unfolds the truth that knowledge is ""nothing more than a slow and gradual cure of our blindness."" This insightful book is a must read for anyone who is feels a call to excellence in scholarship."
2,Not for me,Did not like the smell at all !!!!! Problem I was having cleared up before having a real chance to use it.
4,Just Good Stuff,"So what if it's ""not either one's best work""... it's good stuff. The music is easy to listen to, and it has something to say, and best of all, they are singing, not yelling or talking. It's the way music is supposed to be experienced... turn it on, kick back, and let it transport you to somewhere sweet. It's 70's rock, and there's nothing wrong with that."
3,Not Their Best,"Considering the pedigree of the two principals, Long May You Run was a bit of a disappointment, but that shouldn't have been surprising to anyone who followed their careers. Neil Young always saved his best songs for his solo career, and by the time this record came out, Stephen Stills seems to have lost his muse. Still all is not lost. The title track is a gorgeous pop song that didn't get nearly the airplay it deserved and Fountainebleau is an underrated song that contains some scorching lyrics and some very nice guitar work. Not for the casual fan, but if you like Neil Young, it will make a nice addition to your collection."
5,Warms the heart and helps you remember what's really important in life.,"One thought kept running through my mind while reading this book, ""I can't believe I've been so busy that I've forgotten about the importance of friendships and caring for other people."" This book redirected my ambitions so that I now am less selfish and more focussed on my relationships with other people. Everyone could benefit from reading this book."
1,waste of money,most of the information in the book is trivial and already available free on-line in the form of different tutorials. Bought the book but did not learn any thing new.
3,not very organized,"i like writing books of south american writers, but this one is not very organized, story is some parts very strong but then weak in other parts.The author has tried to give a super natural taste to that , but i think he could abbreviate the book a lotany way what is the problem with sexuality in south america , seems that it is a big issue there."
4,Opens a new world!,"It's a scary world out there, but it's worth knowing about it. Llosa painted it in new colours which I didn't even know existed. On ever page I waited to be killed, and by the middle I wasn't affriad of death. What a book!"
3,Eh...it was all right,"What was going on in this book? Some character development and then none at all. Complete luck that Luke's party stumbled onto the Battle of Bastion. This whole book was very up and down. First 60 pages it took me three months. Then I started to ease my way through it. It was a rough read. Definitely could have been better. And it's way to long for so much nothing. It was very average and my lord what do the Ryn have to do with anything? Plus these two authors need to quit it with calling Han and Leia ""Anakin's Parents"" nonstop. Plus this whole thing with Tahiri is quite annoying. And don't Han and Leia and the military Twin Suns Squadron have more important things to do than go to small insignificant planets and stop them from falling to the Vong? Shouldn't they be fighting the true war? What is going on? The next two better explain what's going on..."
1,Would love to have the money back that I spent on this,It was smaller than I thought. The candles do not work as they should. It is not worth the money I spent.
3,Shooting Star's poofy hair phase,"This cd starts off strong with Summer Sun, Somewhere In Your Heart and Heat Of The Night, but soon lapses into tired sounding filler. Summer Sun was one of the great ""shouldabeen"" songs of the summer of 1985, but despite occasional airplay, it never really caught on. Too bad. Maybe with a hit Gary West would have chosen to stay with the band. Now all we have is Shooting Star part II, a pale and poor substitute. This one is worth it if you find it cheap because the first three songs make a great addition to a career retrospective, plus there is the addition of the previously unreleased songs from the ""Up The Creek"" soundtrack. Get Ready Boy isn't great, but it was a pretty decent soundtrack song.(Oh yeah, and for a laugh, check out the band picture on the back cover. Can any of you honestly say that this was a good look?)"
1,Misleading,"I would recommend that those looking for the silver bullet this book touts take a pass. The idea that this is a simple strategy is quite misleading, given that the ""simple"" strategy is to log into the author's web site to gather the needed data. I would suggest this book is more of an advertisement for a website versus an investment book worth merit."
5,THE beginners book,"the first book everyone comtemplating investing should read. if investing in the stock market doesn't interest you after reading this book, ican't imagine what will."
3,Watch out before investing money according to the book formula !,"The book is having a great success because it explains in plain english the basics of value investing but the main attractive point is another one.It provides a method which in last 17 years would have doubled the returns of the S&P; 500. The statical evidences and the supporting arguments behind the ""magic formula"" are really compelling but be careful before investing real money.Buying and reading the book is only the first step. You will imperatively need the author proprietary stock screener available for free at www.magicformula.com.I made some trials and unfortunately the stock screener is not reliable at all:- it is not updated daily as advistised in the FAQ page of the web site- the customer support in fact does not exist, I made 2 enquiries by email to investigate the site glitches and did not receive any reply."
1,Very basic,"This book is about a very complicated subject written in a very basic and simplistic format. All in all I found it of little help for the individual investor. The very complicated subject is determing the market value of company considering the various factors that go into such a determination. Then it tries to factor in risk and the time value of money. All this is important to professionals, but of little importance to the individual small investor. The simplification of the calculations is meant to help the small investor but in fact does not help at all."
1,I suggest to read some basic stuff before you buy this book,"First of all, I purchased this book, and did it as it suggested, but failed!!!then I tried to learn some other basic book, such as ""Stock Trend analysis"", you will find this book did NOT teach you anything, and just ask you to believe some ""Magic"" in the world, if everyone has this book and follow what the author suggested, then everyone will make money from stock market, it is simply not true!!!"
5,Simply a great book!,"Fabulous! Every investor should buy and read ""The Little Book That Beats the Market."" Joel Greenblatt accomplishes what many financial writers fail to do-he distills complex information into an understandable guide for all investors that is easy to understand and put to practical use. Don't let the name dissuade you, even if you are a stock market professional: This is one of the best books to come out on how to invest in years!"
2,"Meh, it does not help me be a better investor.","Despite all the promises and claims, this is more a get rich for sure scheme I think.It is not backtested from what I could see and I would not trust it with all markets and situations. Different investors, at different times of their investing life will need different things. This thin book may come in handy to level wobbly washer, but it won't make me money."
5,"Yes, you DO need to read the book","Mr. Greenblatt has done the individual investor a great service by writing this book and maintaining a free website that provides the necessary information to implement it. He outlines a common sense, value investing strategy that has produced hard-to-argue-with results over the last 20 years. I strongly disagree with those reviewers who claim the book isn't necessary -- just follow the strategy. As Mr. Greenblatt emphasizes repeatedly, the strategy can only work if you stick with it for a minimum of three years, and few will actually do that if they don't understand the logic behiind it or appreciate it's track record. Read the book. The cost is a pittance relative to the gains one might expect, it's short, it's clear, and (unlike most investing books) it's actually an enjoyable read."
5,Straight Thinking,I enjoyed reading the book and will use the information to invest. The book is well written and easy for the non-financial fellow like me to understand. I recommend it.
4,Well worth a read,"I did not like the simple writing style of this book. It is like a kid's book. Also it could have been written in one chapter because he has little to say.However having said this, the writer writes what many studies have shown to be true, that to invest on the share market successfully you need patience and look to value. He is saying buy shares with high ROA and high earning yields. I think he underestimates P/E and dividends but anyway.If you are too caught up in the random walk theory or index funds please give this book a read."
2,Unnecessary update to the first edition,Very little value is added to this edition except some post Credit Crisis backtest result of the system.Save your money and get a used 1st edition copy instead.
1,terrible and slow,They took almost three weeks to get me this book and I paid for the good shipping- jerks
1,Superficial Treatment of a Complex Subject,"Mr. Benedict attempts to write a book about an entire group og people without interviewing a single member of the group. No competent journalist interested in a fair and accurate treatment of a tribe as controversial as this would consider that an adequate effort. There is a fascinating tale of who these people are, of how they achieved what they have, whether by hook or by crook, of how the money and change in status has affected both them and the region. Unfortunately Mr. Benedict has chosen to take the easy way out and has written a utterly simplistic and superfifical treatment of a far richer and complex story of America today."
3,"Good Movie, but DVD is FLAWED","On my dvd copy, the Trailer and Special Features buttons are unselectable. Anyone else have this problem?"
5,Brilliant,"Once upon a time long ago, I saw a film by Conrad Rooks, ""Chappaqua"" that blew my mind. In all the years of ""brilliant films"" I haven't seen anything that compares to ""Chappaqua"" until now with ""Tarnation"". Caouette's imagination is brilliant; taking your mind with him with his usage of video, snapshots, answering machine messages, and whatever else came into his mind....just as with Rooks (no computers in Rooks' filmmaking). ""Tarnation"" is painfully personal which allows the viewer to capture Caouette's humor, pride and above all his love and caring not only for his own mother but this film made him aware of human dignity and what being a real human being is about with love and care for others....and with cool music. Amen!!!"
5,excellent,I will be saving this to pass on to my grandchildren as it is a beautiful illistraited edition.
5,Memories,"I ordered this book for my 83 year young mother-in-law, we had been talking about books she had read years ago. You should have seen her face when this little book arrived!!!!!!"
3,I didn't like this story.,Questionable. I can't believe that I enjoyed this book as a child. Maybe I read a condensed or child's version. I really didn't enjoy this story.
1,Anything with the wording Sambo is racist,"Not-surprisingly, I can believe that this book is still being published. I am also not surprised that white Americans who read this book find it nothing more than humorous. Perhaps if white Americans had to ever go through life being called Sambo, nigger, monkey etc. they would understand how incredibly offensive this book is."
5,Reminds me of my childhood,"I remember having a very small version of this book in the house when I was small. I think my sister has it now, so it's survived about 40+ years. I remember reading this book and wondering how could the tiger turn into butter."
1,offensive,"I think that this novel, while valuable in showing adult readers 19th century attitudes towards blacks, is one of the worst things todays child could read. This novel instills horrible stereoypes in children that our culture has tried so hard to eliminate (I'm American). It is an atrocity to have this book on our school library shelves."
1,Your racism ain't like mine,"While many who find Bannerman's story of little black sambo cute,they fail to understand that major complaint that African-Americans and people of African descent had with the story, was the gross exaggerated illustrations that left no doubt that the character was of African descent. while the author mentions India, the illustrations were definitely derrogatory no matter who and what race they portrayed. Julian Lester's ""Sam and the Tiger"" tells the same story without the gross derrogatory illustrations."
5,Little Black Sambo,"I was given this book as a child, Sambo was my hero because he outwitted the tiger, I still love pancakes. As an African American grand-parent, I feel no offense, it is more about bullies, no matter what color."
1,not what I expected,"Dissapointed that this was not the book I remembered as a child, this version was Indian, wish I had known that before I bought it."
2,Not what it seems,"While looking at the ""look inside"" it seemed that the hard cover of the book was red with a tiger holding an umbrella. I was really looking for the specific feature of this book and it was not the case."
5,book review,"This little book was my favorite reading, 75years ago.....I've never seen it in stores,but never really looked for it. I now havea little great grand daughter. 3 yrs old...andwanted to get the book for her....I found iton Amazon, and was thrilled to find it. Thankyou Amazon.janut b"
1,This was published in 2011???!!!,"This is racist trash and I find myself alternately appalled and amused by the bizarrely arrogant defense of such insulting tripe, brimming with racial slander. These sentiments are quite revealing."
5,Postmodern Prayer Pilgramage Journal,"This book is a great read. Much less cerebral than Blue Like Jaz, this is the story of Miller's trip to the Grand Canyon with good friend Paul. During the journey, God shows his mysterious care for them several times - through wonderful and unexpected turns of events and direct answers to prayers. The book is practical theology - Miller is not interested in theology of abstracts here, it is theology lived."
3,"Good, but the original was better","""Through Painted Deserts: Light, God, and Beauty on the Open Road"" is a rewritten version of Millers first book ""Prayer and the Art of Volkswagen Maintenance"". Frankly, I prefer the original. Although this new version provides material which was not included in the first version, much of which is interesting and welcom, it was at the expense of other material which was removed. It is almost as if the publisher told Miller that he was allowed only so many words and if he added something in one place he would have to remove something else in some other place. On the whole it is a huge mistake as the material which was removed often outshines the material which was added. A better choice would have been to include the new material without removing any of the original book. Personally, between the two I would recommend ""Prayer and the Art of Volkswagen Maintenance"" instead."
4,Interesting read,"At first I didn't know why I found this book to be so riveting. Upon reflection I realized it was because I felt like I was actually there with Mr. Miller throughout his trek and sojourn. For me it was just light-hearted and enjoyable reading, not really burdened with weighty or theological content, although there were some meaningful moments along the way. I recommend that you read this book after his hit Blue Like Jazz, even though this is chronologically backward, as it will help you to understand how he got to where he was when he wrote BLJ.RJC"
4,Good Light-Hearted Road Material,"I also read the original--Prayer and the Art...--only after the publication of Blue Like Jazz. Actually I never made it through the first edition. While I loved the idea of a roadtrip with Donald Miller, his overuse of the passive voice left me stalling in light of the electrifying conversational buzz of BLJ. I let my copy of PAVM sit around for a couple weeks before selling it back.The new edition--Through Painted Deserts--definitely traveled better and had me all the way through to its Sunrise. C.S. Lewis said, ""we read to know we're not alone,"" and I would recommend this book on that basis: anyone longing to hit the road for a while yet lacking the immediate means to do so should find instant companions in Don and Paul and their Vanagon. For bonafide Donald Miller fans it also illuminates this segment of Don's spiritual growth and provides a worthy prequel to ""To Own a Dragon."""
4,Good buy,"Sizes run a bit on the small size, and since they do not come in half sizes be sure to order a size up."
5,Wonderful!!!,"Loved this book!!! I'm a big collector of comic strip books....Can not wait until the next one comes to the stores! I enjoy family type comics and its nice to see a different type (but common?!) one portrayed. I've shown this to my friends and they have all seen themselves in one or more of the characters, So Kudos to Jan Eliot for the book!! Let's hope to see the next one soon."
3,crossover favorite,"""Distant Thunder"" is only distinguishable in that the crossover hit ""Don't Turn Around"" (later covered by the inane Ace of Base)is on it.In terms of a pure reggae album, this lp by no means qualifies. Indeed, the funk/soul elements that now dominate Aswad's music are front and center on this album, though reggae elements permeate the album, as well as some of its messages on tracks like the powerful ""Set Them Free.""Fans of more traditional reggae will likely cringe at this album, as I did when I first heard it. Fret not- Aswad made credible reggae lps. Look out for their ""Hulet"" and ""To the Top"" lps for a better look at their reggae material.As a crossover lp, this cd comes recommended, but fans of more pure reggae should look elsewhere for their fix."
4,It's a must have for any Hip-Hop Hed!,It has a House feel while still staying true to Hip-Hop. This is a classic Hip-Hop record that any real Hip-Hop hed should have! I'm stoked to add this to my collection!
2,Poor Packaging and Book Condition,"The item arrived expedited, and in fair condition although it was listed in new condition. The spine of the book was cracked and the edges of the book were cracked in 2 areas, all apparently from shipping. The book was shipped in an Express Mail Envelope. Perhaps, if more attention was paid to packaging, the item would have arrived as I expected. The seller was apologetic yet offered no compensation whatsoever. If you value quality of items upon arrival, I advise you beware of this seller's carelessness in packaging and handling. I believe this was an honest mistake in an effort to avoid extra costs."
3,An Ok Movie,"This movie contains the following episodes:1. Naughty N'Nice2. Prediction of doom3. Enemies no more4. checkmateThese episodes are okay, but I like Prediction of doom, because i think that it's so touching that he at first makes her feel so happy, and then makes her cry her eyes out. I personally think that without that episode, this video wouldn't be as good."
2,Underpowered for the experienced administrator,"While this book delivers on it's promise to be a ""Quick Reference Guide"" for the Network administrator, it just does not provide enough information for an experienced NetWare admin. Instead, consider ""Novell's Complete Guide to NetWare 5 Networks"" You will find all of the information contained in the Administrator's Handbook in this volume, except it goes a bit deeper into the technical aspects of NetWare networks."
1,Allergic,"Don't know what's in this product, and maybe it's the honeysuckle, I don't know, but this product produces a red rash ring around my armpits. I am allergic to the lemongrass brand of Tom of Maine's as well.I've used various brands of Tom of Maine's for a long time, and -- now, I'm developing allergies? This is ridiculous but true. I have had no trouble with the calendula scent so I'll probably stop trying out new scents."
2,not for me,"I love tom's, but this doesn't work for me. I'm searching for a aluminum/paraben free deodorant that actually works for me."
2,"Um, no.","Some parts of this book are good, some are boring. Its is very slow reading because of the heroic verse form. So be carefull."
5,Outstanding!!,"The book stands out not only for its beautiful illustrations by Gustave Dore (unarguably one of the most cherished illustrators of all times), but also for the marvelous quality of this edition.The book is quite big (at first I thought it was huge) - but it is not so heavy, the jacket bares a label in golden relief, the hardcover repeats the design without the relief quality, the print is fine and so is the paper, the font is well chosen so that it makes the text easy to read, each song has a short synopsis at the beginning so that one can quickly overlook the plot.AND last but not the least - the insanely high ratio quality/price!!!!! I highly recommend this book to everyone who would love such a valuable volume that could be passed on to generations, in their library, plus it could make a wonderful present! 5 stars from me"
1,product no-show,I sent for this product many weeks ago and have received nothing. My email to the seller went unanswered. This is my first disappointment with using Amazon.com for book purchases; I hope it will be the last.
1,Bad Book,"Man, I had to read this book. It was so boring and hard to read. Skip it or read the cliff notes if at all possible."
3,"Great Book, Not-so-great Edition","I suppose I could be thankful that this edition did not try to update Milton's English. The software that comes with it is just a .doc file; a hypertext document linking outdated words to definitions or mythic references to explanations would have been far more useful. The book itself is in a pleasing font, but the binding is weak and pages easily fall out."
5,Classic,"This book has withstood time and criticism to emerge as a classic work of literature. This edition's beautiful cover enhances the art within, and the many footnotes help provide clarity and context."
5,Beautiful,"I didn't like it too well the first time I read this for a Milton class I took in school. But after reading it and exploring it a second time, I discovered that I am in love with it. The margins of my copy are so full you can barely read any of the actual poem. I am currently reading ""Paradise Regained,"" which is also brilliant."
2,"good book, horrible spelling","I made it to the middle of book two before I decided I would go to the library Monday and check this book out. The epic was very good so far, it's just that the kindle free edition is filled with a ridiculous amount of typos. I understand that lots of words were spelled differently back in the day, but this edition is riddled with obvious typos."
4,Excellent Edition of the Classic,"I was very pleased with this edition. It was somewhat large, with glossy dust jacket and preservation of the original poetic form (in terms of margins and such). Unlike previous editions, the text is not hampered by dredging annotations (which in some editions may take up half of a page of the poem), and Pullman does a good job in giving his analysis. If you've ever read His Dark Materials, you can definitely see the connection between Pullman and Paradise Lost. Original woodcuts are included in this edition, however, I feel that their inclusion is not complete. But I can't complain.This is the sort of edition worthy of any scholar (and it's the right edition for showing off in your bookcase too)."
5,Good Book,"Finally get to read it, somehow missed that portion of my high school required reading . Is my 15 word limit up yet?"
1,Did not receive the item,"We never received the order. We were told that since it passed the 90 days after we ordered, there is nothing they will do for us. I will never order from this seller. We were not the only one who never received their orders."
3,Manana es para siempre,"La novela de Manana es para siempre es buena, pero es mas de lo mismo... de la novela la mejor actuacion fue la de Lucero... Lo que me desagrado es lo mucho que alargan las cosas y en ocasiones es bastante monotona..."
5,"Chrono Crusade, Vol. 7","The last book I needed an awesome series!! Nice plot flow, great cast of characters as we creep closer and closer to the end!"
2,menage a trois,"La regla de tres es la historia de las relaciones entre una mujer y dos hombres, formando un triangulo amoroso, y las complicaciones y reflexiones que surgen de esta relacion. Personalmente creo que no es lo mejor que ha escrito Gala. La exotica historia de La pasion turca o Mas alla del jardin lo superan con creces."
3,"Pretty, but...","Beautiful clock and resets itself after every power loss, which is why I bought it. But has a couple of stupid characteristics, the first being so bright in a darkened room that you wonder what light you forgot to switch off. In addition, the numbers are too small to set the alarm. You can't see the damned numbers without buying some reading glasses and putting them on, not the activity you hope for when going to bed. Do designers use what they design? You know, to discover what they didn't think of?"
3,Show up if not already at birthday,"3 1/2Short, showy, and still somewhat spectacular, the esteemed bass player invited listeners into a solo career benefiting immensely from talent alone but inevitably driven to kitsch in later years. Falling somewhere in between the sheer brilliance of rising work and the sad packaged demise, the big band effect is handled mostly well, if at times cluttered."
4,"Good rack for flat pans, cutting boards.","Am on a mission to declutter and be organized.... this was just one foray into organizing my kitchen cabinets, and stuff is much easier to see and get now."
3,Tasty if not very spicy,"I was hoping these noodles would have a little more kick than they did, but aside from being not as hot as I'd like, they're pretty tasty. I ended up adding some crushed red pepper flakes and that helped a bunch. Adding some scallions, mushrooms, and shrimp or chicken turns them into a nice meal. The noodles cook well but are only average in the flavor department. They won't make you feel like you got carry-out from your favorite Chinese place, but they're not awful either.Not the best Chow Mein you can get, but easy to make, and even easier to add your own fresh ingredients to, so all-in-all not a bad quick meal."
1,Not Very Good,"If you're into made-for-tv quality movies, Puerto Vallarta Squeeze is for you. I wasn't expecting much and that's exactly what I got. I've seen a few movies with Scott Glenn where he was a supporting actor and that's where he should stay. In my opinion, he just wasn't very good as the lead and shouldn't be in the lead of an ""action"" film. He came across as way too old to be as lethal as he was portrayed to be that it pushed the envelop of believability. The ""love story"" aspect of the movie was laughable.The premise of the movie is nothing new (which isn't a bad thing), but the production value and acting is made-for-tv quality or in this case, straight-to-video quality. Avoid this movie, not even Harvey Keitel could save it."
5,Puerto Vallarta Squeeze,"This movie was truly a roller coaster ride! A story of vengence, deceit, betrayal and finally redemption - WOW! The cast really complemented each other - no slackers. The vistas of Mexico gave the storyline a heightened reality. Needless to say that I have recommended this movie to my friends."
4,Bourne Identity for Scott Glenn,"Got this because I'm a fan of Scott Glenn, always good to see him carry a movie. A movie with surprising heart and interesting situations between the characters. A big plus is that we visit Mexico and DO NOT have an evil Mexican crime lord 'Jefe'. The villain is American! Sort of a Bourne Identity for Scott Glenn, a role he handles superbly. The movie is a little long at parts (like the serenading dinner or the trips to the bus stop), but has a great conclusion that satisfies."
1,Very Disappointing,"To pay this much for a video, I was dissapointed in what was not included. There was no discussion about brushes and their use. There was no discussion about age appropriate make-up. There was only one young model. There was no other skin colors to demonstrate on. Hydration method is just getting your brush wet. It was assumed that you already knew what you were doing and here are some very expensive helpful hints. It is only 1/2 hour and you can learn most of it from just reading magazines. There is a lot of talk about color but not really any instructions about it. I would like to get my $ back."
4,I Love Phil Harris!,"These are the funs songs your parents sang around the house, and no one knew where they'd heard them--they heard 'em from Phil Harris! Completely goofy, corny and fun."
5,Modern Classic,"These stories are much more than fiction; they are dramatized memoirs, finely tuned documentaries. This modern classic tells us truths about the tragedy of Germany that cannot be found in history books. Isherwood's book is art of an extremely gifted writer.--Diana Dell, author, ""A Saigon Party: And Other Vietnam War Short Stories."""
5,Why buy it? Why not!!!!!,"This is the most moving book I have ever read. One of my friends said that when she read reviews about this book it sounded ""too clever"" and ""not for anyone who isn't a 48 year old English Professor"" She read the bopok and LOVED it. She keeps a copy of this book by her bed and has read it 3 times. I have only read it once and I love it. This is a must-read for anyone...whether they be teeny-bopper N'Sync Fans to 48 year old English Professors."
2,"Good design, but RUSTS!!!!","I bought this for my newly finished kitchen and was VERY DISAPPOINTED when the metal began to rust after 3 months. Not from the sponges, but on the outside of the unit. I have to have a towel underneath so it doesn't damage my new countertop! I do NOT recommend this product."
2,Not worth the money,"I loved this soap dispenser at first. It really looked nice on my counter until it started to rust. I've only had it for a few months, so it was definately not worth the money. I would not recommend this product."
2,Don't Bother,I have owned this for several years. I purchased it at Linens n Things a while back. I have to clean the unit twice or more a week. It doesn't drain and is prone to mold. It also has rusted. I am throwing it out to buy another. Don't bother spending the money.
1,"Sorry to say - boring, with 2-dimensional acting","I agree with the negative comments - I eventually stopped watching it - unconvincing acting - (and a small point that I found irritating - in TV movies about war, some of them have a ""too-clean look"" that make a film seem unrealistic. There is no dirt anywhere, as far as I could see - everybody looks too clean, the settings look too clean, and not realistic. The acting level was what finally turned me off. Glad it was on TV."
3,Good but loooonnnggg - needs better maps,"If you are a history buff, this is a very good ""biography"" of Alexander the Great. However, if you are just interested in Alexander, look for something simpler and shorter.In addition, the maps in the paperback edition are very hard to read (and there are not enough!) I found that trying to follow Alexander's route without a good series of maps to be quite a challenge."
4,Avid Reader,"Overall, the book was okay. It had the characters behaving stupidly upon occasion but it still was a decent read. The sex was hot of course and the story line was fairly solid. I just thought the characters could have acted a little more intelligently."
3,Underground Guardians,"To be honest, I am not real sure how I felt about this book. The plot was pretty good which is one of the main reasons that i kept reading. I think the thing that got me the most is that this book left VERY little to the imagination. There was definitely a lot of heat but at times it felt like i was reading a hardcore porn flick instead of an actual book. The characters were ok but after a while the Holly Heart started to get on my nerves. There were some grammatical errors as well as several unnecessary sentences. Like I said, it left very little to the imagination.Overall, I did like the book because the overall plot was good and I enjoyed the fact that the author focused mostly on the main characters and plots and didnt waste time with a ton of unnecessary side stories. I liked Mason and Sterling and loved their friendship. This book at the time of purchase was free and as much as I hate to say it, I am seriously considering buying the next one in the series."
1,Money Wasted,"Do not make the same mistake that I did. I could not belive that I paid money for theese, T-Shirt like sheets! I threw them in the trash after one night of sleeping on them. ""Evil Sheets!"""
3,Color them badd.,"Most likely when someone tosses out the term boy-band, N'Sync or Backstreet Boys come to mind. However, Color Me Badd was doing their thing years before those two groups, and much better. Ok, so New Kids On The Block were around too, but they weren't as badd. These guys have a ""Best Of"" out also, but the best of that is basically right on this album. Included is their biggest hit ""I Wanna Sex You Up"". That track was in the movie ""New Jack City"", and is also here in reprise form. Other hits were ""I Adore Mi Amore"", ""Thinkin' Back"", and the extremely catchy ""All 4 Love"". The bottom line is that these guys were so badd they were good, and where else are you gonna get George Michael, Terence Trent D'Arby, Vanilla Ice, and Kenny G on the same album?"
4,The best album from Color Me Badd,"I like this album from Color Me Badd WAY better than their boring and quiet Now and Forever CD. This debut C.M.B. album has many more exciting songs. I like how the C.M.B. album is not as racy as their Now and Forever album, which had a few songs that were too much for my ears. This C.M.B. album is more decent to listen to."
4,GOTTA LOVE YOUR OL' SCHOOL,I LOVE THIS ALBUM. IT BRINGS BACK MEMORIES OF MY CHILDHOOD. GREAT SONGS AND AN OVERALL GREAT ALBUM
5,fast shipper,"I bought it for grand daughters high school project, arrived on time as advertised, will purchase from this vendor again"
5,"Years later, this book is still affecting people","I just read this book last year, as a tenth grader. It might sound as though I'm exaggerating if I say it changed my life, but I believe that almost everything you read changes you in a small way. Well, this book changed me in a big way. I'll still be thinking about these stories months after I read them. They're the kind of stories that make you want to close your eyes and think for an hour after you're done reading them. This book was my introduction to Kurt Vonnegut, and it remains my favorite.I also think its amazing how a book read by somebody 30 years ago can still have the same effect on a young person today, and I hope that 30 years from now, this book will still change people."
1,Let the buyer beware,"The item I am reviewing is 5 BY KURT VONNEGUT which I ordered for my son. As the picture and copy stated it was 5 books in original slipcase. My son received one book. It was the book pictured which was ""Welcome to the Monkey House"". I contacted the seller and he said it was his ""suppliers"" fault which only brings me to the conclusion that I should make sure that I'm buying from vendors that KNOW exactly what they are advertising,what they are selling, and what they are shipping.This is really my first poor experience buying through Amazon but it brings to mind a very important ""proverb""in ""let the buyer beware""."
2,A poor edition of an excellent collection,"Picked this up as the $1.99 deal of the day, and it's worth about that much. The stories are excellent, and a must for any Vonnegut fan. But this particular Kindle edition is just awful. It's like one long stream of text, not even any Table of Contents so that you can jump to the story that interests you the most. And, as other reviewers have noted, there's been absolutely zero proofreading. It's hard to go more than 1 or 2 pages without a glaring typo staring you in the face, sometimes even in character names.You should definitely buy this book. Just not *this* book."
2,Not literature,"Red this book at the request of a colleague. I can see why he liked it, simplistic solutions for very complicated problems, much like ... Well then, a quick read, nothing complicated here, and an alright story but fails a deep understanding and complexity of societies problems. Read the history of places where prisoners have been dumped, e.g. Georgia & Australia, and as Paul Harvey says, ""Here is the rest of the story."""
1,boring,"I didn't like this at all. His first album, ""Dice"", is a classic but this one misses the mark by far. Try ""Dice"" or ""Dice Rules"" instead."
5,New Jack City is still going on?,"New Jack City is one of the movies that really made me realize what was going on out there in the streets. Another reality is that these things are still going on today as I am typing this review. There will always be a Nino Brown with a fly girlfriend on his side. All of this is simply life period and what more can I say besides the movie is great. I look at all the people who are now older and doing their thing. We really don't see Wesly Snipes like we used to. Ice T is doing his thing with ""Law & Order"", Vanessa Williams has finished her work on the ""Soul Food Series"", Christopher Williams is missing in action for whatever reason, but he is still a nice looking man, Allen Payne was really good in ""Blue Hill"", Michael Michelle is doing her thing. The movie has really shined the light on life in America along with how neighborhoods do in fact change. There will always be the ""Pookies"" too. Great movie, outstanding cast and script."
4,Very Good,"It's very useful when you want to cook a lot, very quickly.But it's really big, i mean, big. You can cook steaks for 6 people in a couple of minutes, very ligt (you don't need cooking oil or something like that)"
4,Great Plate !!,"I'm a regular user of the electric grill. We make breakfast (eggs, potatoes, pancakes....), grill up some quick veggies, chicken, you get the idea. I wanted as much grill space as I could get in a portable unit. This one does not disappoint, it heats quickly and the non-stick surface has worked great. Easy clean-up, a grease channel and the all black looks good on the counter.The only reason I didn't rate this a 5 was that you do have to get used to some hot zones around where the coils have been run to heat the unit. However, you learn that pretty quickly and your off and grrrrillling !!"
4,Jumbo Electric Griddle,The title doesn't lie - this griddle is JUMBO - you can cook a lot of pancakes on it - it will also hold an entire pound of bacon! It is awesome - and you can clean it easily - the only problem is it is so big it may not fit in most sinks for cleaning.
5,Great Book,This book I was given in High School in 1963. It made me look at things totally different. Kids with Challenges are gifts to us. They teach us so much. I purchased this book for my Grand Daughter.
1,"Does not work with fore runner 101 despite being ""better together""","I have to give this item one star.While I am sure that it is a very good product it does not work with the fore runner 101 that I bought it for. Well you may say that it is for the 201 not the 101 so why would I expect it to work with the 101???....because it is offered as part of a ""better together"" deal with the101. It appears that the room required for the AAA batteries makes the 101 just fat enough so that this mount will not work with it. Unfortunately I did not figure this out until I had cut open the packaging for the mount."
3,Misconceptions on Japanese culture in translation,"Despite what some of the previous reviewers have said, this translation is not that bad.For the record, a rice-ball is just that -- a ball of rice. In Japanese, it's an ""onigiri."" Basically historical Japanese fast food. Sushi did not exist in the 12th century. Why *not* call sake wine? Would these reviewers be upset that ""lager"" is usually called just ""beer""?And ""general of the guards"" has nothing to do with the shogunate. Since when is the shogun a palace GUARD?As for Minister of the Left: The Great Council of State -- which governed Japan -- was headed by three ministers: Minister of the Left, M. of the Right, and M. of the Center. The Left was senior to the other two.Could this have been a better translation? Definitely. And for many reasons. But not for any of the ones whinged about in previous reviews."
3,A great story with an out-of-date translation,"Like others reviewing this novel, I've significant experience in Japan. And, like other Yoshikawa novels it is a wonderful mechanism for looking back on the Japan of legend. As with any good historical fiction, the historic details and culture are correct and well presented.My argument is with the translation. If we are referring to the same translation (published by Kodansha many years ago, I believe) it is a problem of the translator glossing over matters which he feels may be beyond the comprehension or the interest of the reader. Sushi is referred to as 'rice balls', sake becomes 'wine', etc. One feels that many details are missing. Partially, I suspect, it was a product of its times, when interest in Japanese culture was not so great.I'd love to read a modern translation, say by the translator of Yoshikwa's 'Musashi'.Regardless, it is a good read and is a window back into a unique and compelling culture."
4,Different Style,"Just flipping through the songs, I can already tell that NSYNC has adopted a whole new style compared to their previous albums. This cd at first seems very fresh, and frankly, very fun to listen to, i actually found myself dancing already to the songs! After listening through about half of each song, I already have my favorite, ""Just the two of us"", it kind of reminds me of Jordan Knight's ""Give it to You"", but anyways i would recommend this cd to any nsync fan because it is a new sound."
2,WEAK!!!,"Each CD they release has been of less quality than the last and it is nice to see that they didn't stop that trend. Top to bottom the first CD was the best. The second CD had three excellent songs and the rest were mediocre. On this effort they have replaced mediocrity for just plain bad. Again they fire off with real winner in ""Pop"" but there is no depth to the album."
1,Not a good effort.,"This album is really bad. OK, Pop was not bad but only due to the production of BT. Its edgy and its got a kick to it (I prefer the remixed version). This version drags somewhat. The rest of the CD is just bad. Sorry folks, but that's just my opinion. The sales of this album is in decline so most people tend to agree."
3,Pretty good CD,I've been a big fan of NSync for a while and I love everything they do. So I got Celebrity and it was a little bit of a disappointment because it wasn't as good as the first two albums. But dont get me wrong!... It is a good CD... it's just not as good as the other two. It is still worth the money :-)
5,The Guys do it once more,"*NSYNC has once again changed the face of the bubble gum packaged pop world. With R&B moves,that will keep you on your toes no matter how many times you listen to it, to the slow and warm ""Selfish"". No doubt that the guys will have a major hit on their hands. Congrats to *NSYNC, and their awesome new album."
1,N'SYNC Gone Bad,"I'm not an NSYNC fan but I know a bad album when I hear it. I loved their self titled album and No Strings Attached was great, but Celebrity shows no signs of development. With lyrics like ""Tell me girl what's his name What'd he do to take you? Does he freak you the way that I do? Cause you know that I know how to and you'll just be a memory I think I've had enough"" and ""She took my hand We never said a word at all She starting grinding Shorty had me up against the wall"" isn't proving Justin and JC as serious writers. If I had kids, its nothing I would them listening to. None of the tracks scream ""Listen to Me!"" like previous ones on No Strings, although ""Gone"" is pretty catchy. I see this as the downfall of NSYNC.(Yes NENETTE, this is ASHLEY!)"
1,"A classic my fin, even Fearless Freddy is better than this!",N'Sync are no Xtynct. No one listens to these fairies who sing like they were castrated pallies. I can't believe the FIVE STAR REVIEWERS can't accept that teen pop is OVER! Avoid or I'll yell HEEGOTCHA!
3,GARBAGE And PORQUERIA,"Este Album de Nsync Me Dejo Mucho Que Desear, es una Porqueria La Unica Cancion Buena A Mi Parecer es Gone Y Eso Que Es Aburrida No Se porqque Gaste Mi Dinero en Esta Basura Hay Canciones Que.......Mejor Dichop Todo el Cd Parce que Fuera La Misma Cancion Lo Dicho el Mejor Album de Nsync Es El 2 De Su Corta Carrera."
2,(....),"1. POP - extremely bad w/ beatbox (Rating 2/5)2. Celebrity - OK but kind of selfish (3/5)3. The Game Is Over- Annoying (1/5)4. Girlfriend - Favorite (5/5)5. The Two Of Us - So weird (2/5)6. Gone - 2nd fave (5/5)7. Tell Me, Tell Me Baby - Even more annoying, but an OK song(2/5)8. Up Against The Wall - OK, but not good (2/5)9. See Right Through You - Bashing fan song (1/5)10. Selfish - selfish. (3/5)11. Just Don't Tell Me That - OK (3/5)12. Someone Like You - Hate the harmonica, but OK (2/5)13. Do Your Thing - OK (3/5)Out of a possible 65 pts, this album only manages 34 pts. Thats 31 minus points that could've made 65 points, euuukk! I can't believe I even gave them 34!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,The best is yet to come!,"NSYNC just goes to show that POP music is ever evolving and changing... in the know on what's hot for the POP generation, these five guys bring the ""Two-Step"" sound to the general populus of America where Craig David and others could not.With each album, Joey, JC, Justin, Lance, and Chris continue to grow in sound, writing, producing, and style.""Celebrity"" is a breath of fresh air from the bubble-gum pop of the 80's and the POP of the 90's... They've revived POP and taken it to a new level!Don't just get the US version, but snap up the IMPORTS as well!"
1,will they ever give up??????????,"save your money & invest on new cds by actual musical bands (AHEM, bands where the members play instruments & have a sense of musicality) like Coldplay, Echo & the Bunnymen or Depeche Mode or even kewl loud heavy stuff like Static X...not this over-marketed cheese!! By the way kiddos, Depeche Mode was ""kewl"" when I was in junior high & high school, why does this generation of teenagers now have to suffer so much from MTV fed crap?!?!?!? & why must us 20-somethings have to hear about this crap EVERYwhere we go?!?!?!"
1,"one good song,the rest is filler","this album might as well be called ""fillerity"". majority of this album is nothing more,but filler!the only good song is the album's first single ""pop"" which doesn't leave your mind for at least a few hours after listening to it.justin timberlake makes a total fool out of himself on this album in the song ""celebrity"" he sings ""would you still know me if i weren't a celebrity"". the hypocriay in that song is that if he weren't a celebrity no one would know him period!this might as well be called ""the justin album"" since he sings ALL the leads!note : in ""gone"" he sounds like whale giving birth.SKIP THIS ALBUM AND GO GET RELOAD BY METALLICA!"
5,*NSYNC,"I really liked this CD. Celebrity has less pure pop than their first CD. They have R&B, two-step, which is popular in the UK, and other sounds. My favorite song is their new single, ""Pop"". *NSYNC co-wrote almost all of the songs on this album. They have great voices and if you like *NSYNC, you'll love this CD."
5,If I wasn't A Celebrity Would You Be So Into Me?,"I was never really a big NSYNC fan until I bought this cd. These guys are so talented, The sound is more mature and fun.Here are some standout tracks:The Game Is Over- This song has clips from the popular game ""Pac Man"". I was very scared when JC started screaming ""how do you think you could do me like that?!"" but it grows on you.That Girl (Will Never Be Mine) - This has to be my favorite song of all time. It is a lovely mix of a ballad and an upbeat song.Falling- Sweet ballad. I would rate this as my third favorite song on the cd. It sounds more pop than anything else on here.Do Your Thing - It is hard to describe this song. It is very ""different"". Very much like ""Giddy Up"" on their first cd.I totally love this cd and all the rest of the tracks are great. I highly recommend buying this for the bonus songs that you wouldn't get on the regular Celebrity cd."
2,No Strings Attached Was Better...,"I was very excited about this album until I put the CD in the player for the first time. I somehow expected more out of the boys and instead got songs with good beats and pretty [bad] lyrics. ""Tell me tell me...baby"" sounds like a Backstreet Boy song...""Celebrity"" is just an annoying song- the fact that they sing ""if I didn't have cheese like every day"" is a sign to me that they've spent a little too much time with those junior high fans of theirs. I was hoping this would be a CD I'd listen to over and over again, now I am thinking it is good for an occasional listen to and will probably best serve as a coaster. Sorry boys, you could have done better."
1,The Game is over face it!!!!,"The Game is over with Celebirty. With there new rap geto sound(didn't i tell you justin wants to be eminem??!!) I think this is not a good abulm you can't under stand it even m you can understand. There just trying to be sooooooooo cool. Like any of them lived in a ""bad"" town. So the game is over this is not even pop!! POP goes nysnc with this awful rap abulm!!!!!!!!!"
4,good work,"this is definitely a great cd. i mean, it's not better than No Strings Attached but it is pretty good. the songs are so well-performed that they have u feeling the emotions that the songs are supposed to give off. up against the wall- makes u wanna dance. gone- u feel justin's pain, really. the only thing is it seems that nsync had now become JC and Justin, instead of all five of the boys. the other three have become mere back-up singers. but still great album. go get it today."
4,The Secret is out. . .they actually R Good,"So I haven't bought the albulm yet, but I'm buying it for one song only: ""Gone"". And it was actually penned by Justin Timberlake, so I'm quite impressed. The haunting melody struck me at my core and gave me the chills. Now, I'm not your typical tenny bopper pop fan. I liked some tracks on the their previous albulbs but would never admit to liking them. But now, the secret is out. . .I Love 'Nsync they are actually good. That have tyte harmonies and descent albeit not stunning lyrics. They are evolving. They may be the new Madonna of the Pop music world: Not the best, but changing to keep up with the times. By the way. . .I love Madonna."
2,Did I listen to the same CD?,"N Sync's sophomore album shows a lack of quality throughout almost every track. The vocals sound strained during most of the songs, possibly due to digital enhancement. It was very hard to determine if there were also any actual live instruments used, most sounded like they had been produced by a computer. The new R&B/Rap approach taken to some tracks also seems to be taking a step away from their current teeny-bopper style. All in all, the songs, vocals, and engineering all fall flat and sound extremely hollow. Strong Recommendation to Avoid!"
3,CELEBRITY IS SILLY,"I own all of NSYNC's albums and this is defintily the worse!! It was such a disapointment, because when you think NSYNC you asume you get those ""nice"" boy band melody sweetheart songs- WRONG! The songs on the CELEBRITY album are ""diffrent"" (a lot of talking to backround music and the music they do use has a lot of strange sound effects.) Anyway, I gave this album 3 stars because I do like some of the music (ex. track 5 & 8, but some of the songs (ex. tack 2) are jsut wierd. If you do buy this album don't expect the kissy, girlie music that we've come to expect from boy bands today... BOTTOM LINE: CELEBRITY IS A BUNCH OF ""FUNKY"" STYLED MUSIC, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF LIKE 3 SLOW SONGS. BASICALLY CELEBRITY CONSISTS OF ""SILLY"" SONGS!"
1,"NSync druled before, now, they really stink!~!","Yikes, am I glad I didn't waste money on this, heard it at a friend's(not) and hated it rate off the bat!! Okay, I don't wanna review this, it would be just too sad, so, all I can say is, this sucks!!"
1,Just trying to chip away at the 4 star rating,"Can someone honestly tell me that this clone boyband's music will be heard years from now? This is music created to capitalize off of the trend the Backstreet Boys created back in the mid 90's. None of this music will be remembered. These songs like ""Pop"" and ""Gone"" are middle of the road pop jibberish. I mean at least the Backstreet Boys have a timeless classic in ""I Want It That Way"". They also sing live and dont focus on cheesy dance routines all the time like Nsync. The ONLY reason these so called ""Artists"" sold so many records is because of their looks and marketing. MTV does wonders for people with little to no talent. Just ask Milli Vanilli, Vanillia Ice, Marky Mark, New Kids on the Block, Britney Spears, Eminem, etc."
2,'N Sync-Celebrity Dissapointing,"The music group, 'N Sync usually have an exceptionally great sound. This album does not showcase their chops, however and is somewhat dissapointing! Two songs (""Just Don't Tell Me That"", ""Tell Me, Tell Me...Baby"")stay close to their roots but the rest is very different, which is not a bad thing, but two thirds of the new stuff gets old pretty quick. The only new-sounding song on the album worth your money is ""Girlfriend."""
2,Not what they promised us.,"Even though I love *Nsync to death, this album did not come out the way I thought. I was hoping for more songs like Bye,Bye, Bye and This I Promise You. Instead we are stuck with 13 songs that all sound alike and not too many love songs. Pop, the first single, is a great song,but all the other songs follow in the same funky style beat. Pop made me believe they were stonger musically. When I listened to the other songs, it sounded as if they were whining about there life and wern't looking for a change."
2,....and this is music?,"i borrowed this CD from someone, listened to 4 songs, and gave it right back. the lyrics are ok, but otherwise this cd has nothing. the music is AWFUL, the voices (other than JC) are pathetic, and the whole thing is blah. Every song sounds like the others and it gets worse- do these guys know about ANYTHING other than breaking up with girls? And how can people say these guys are even even remotely cute? ugh... If only we're lucky enough, this ""pop life""- or at least N*Sync- will be gone soon. At least they're not 16...they'll be too old pretty soon (case in point Debbie- uh, Deborah- Gibson). the cd itself isn't worth the cost."
4,Celebrity,"Whoa.... if you really enjoyed the No Strings Attached CD this one is a let down, unless you are into dance music. This album is great but it is a new sound for Nsync. Nsync has but a lot of electronic soudns into this album and it sounds a lot like the Backstreet Boys' Black & Blue. There are good songs on the album, like the first single, POP. And I really like Up Against the Wall. The slow songs are great but don't compare to This I Promise You. I thihk Nsync went a bit to Techno on this Album and their record sales will drop from No Strings Attached."
1,Dear God,"Artistry is truly dying. The apocalypse is near with manufactured, over-produced, puppets like these leading the way. Anyone that believes any of these walking corporate money vacuums has even an ounce of ""musical"" ability is kidding themselves. Music is art, it's creation from somebody's passion, pain, or happiness, and expressed through song. N'SYNC, Ms. Spears, BSB, and the rest of the robots with the exact same sound and lyrics are an absolute disgrace to every true musician working today. Anyone that disagree's should try to listen to real music, you might like it."
1,A Group?,All of the songs sound like it's just one person is singing on them. This is what a group sound like?
4,"My N Sync ""Celebrity"" CD","I think this cd is really great. It is a big change from N Sync's last release ""No Strings Attached"". MY Favorite songs on the album is ""Just The Two Of Us"" and ""Selfish""."
4,Celebrity review from #1 fan.,"The only way to describe Nsync's ""Celebrity"" would be to say that it's like a big bowl of sherbert ice cream. Very good and refreshing, but it kind of leaves a tart taste in your mouth. While it's nice to see these guys show they know no boundaries when it comes to exploring music, I think their fans would be more impressed if the sound were more polished, especially because they've never tried this level of music before. I think this cd holds a lot of what we'll probably see in the future of Nsync's upcoming albums. And I can only hope that they experiment more with this plane of music and that there next album will show the more put together side of Nsync that there fans all love. Great album, but leaves somewhat of a sour taste in your mouth."
1,More pop music from the assembly line...,"Comon people listen to some music with soul and meaning. Buy Guns 'N Roses Use your Illusion albums. They rock and they'll blow you away musically. They have guys who play their own instruments in it, and play them very well. Please don't let music like this reign the charts anymore. It is a scam by the record companies for them to make s**tloads of money. They give you this sleek ""appealing"" commercial trash used to fool you and get YOUR MONEY!!! These guys are not musicians! Please listen to real music. Their are starving musicians everywhere around the world who deserve to get paid before these little droids do."
5,"Something Fresh, NSync Rules!","This CD is so fresh and cool, it has two-step, mellow songs, slow songs, romantic songs, high energy dance songs, hot pop and electronic tunes, everything! All the songs are beautiful and ssoo cool, and NSync has outdone themselves! I strongly reccomend this album to everyone! NSync Rocks! I love Nsync!"
4,Confusing!,"I seriously don't know what to think of this Cd. There are way too many styles on Celebrity. Can't they pick one style and stay with it? I can understand diversifing, but my gosh, there is just no direction with this. I like the individual songs alone, but together they are very confusing. The only song I really hate is Celebrity and some lines of other songs have me rolling my eyes. But on the opposite end, the only songs I really like are The Game Is Over, The Two Of Us, Tell Me, Tell Me... Baby, Just Don't Tell Me That and Do Your Thing. The rest of the songs are up in the air right now (mostly on the better side than worse), and may always be. I still say Celebrity has way too directions for one Cd. Pick one and stay with it!"
1,Come on guys...enough's enough,"Ok, ive read some stuff about these guys on how they're supposedly ""Very holy""... Yea ok, I don't hear any praising or worshipping in this album...just love songs and girls and stupid stuff like that...live how you write that u do guys...For any people who actually wanna hear good music that sounds somewhat like these fakes, check out some DC Talk, Supertones, and the Newsboys."
4,ITS DIFFERENT THIS TME....,"Nsycn has done it agian....the music is really different from the previouse one and they have compiled a number of geners in this album which makes the difference.POP REALLY STANDS OUT AND ITS GREAT IN ALL RECPECTS.Tracks like tell me tell me baby ,just dont tell me that and that girl will never be mine are somewhat similar in beats and music.The song ""gone"" includes that old classical touch...thats good.Songs like ""do your thing and ""up against the wall"" have the ""rap"" beat.The slow ones did not really stand out this time..they're noraml...good!I must say on the whole its a very good effort ...superb .Nsync has provided the fans with some reall good and different music this time in all respects.....somethings are always missing as ususal but whos perfect???NSYNC IS LIKELY TO SHOW PERFECTION IN THIER NEXT RELEASES.IF U WANT TO HEAR AN ALBUM THAT COMBINES ALL TASTES OF TODAYS MUSIC ""CELEBRITY IS FOR YOU!"
1,TRL&Formula only,if you take away the Self made Group what would you have?between the predictable FOrmula of the song structures&vocals nothing here is worth even talking about.it shouldn't take 4 folks or 5 to sing these songs.but as long as folks aren't about challenging themselves Musically they will follow any trend.there will be another 10-20 Groups like this nothing Original or worthy to say about them.as long as TRL&MTV can control the playlist these type of Acts have HOPE BUT NOT MUCH ELSE TO FALL back on.
4,Its ok!,"I love the song ""Gone"" I like the R&B mix. They sound great in R&B and I think they should think about it more. ""Against the Wall"" is a great dance song, great song for clubbin, I like how they are getting lil 'nasty' lyrics into their music. Also ""Girlfriend"" and ""Selfish"" are two really great songs. I suggest this cd for anyone who really likes 'Pop' music."
2,"Kind of different formula, still a boy band","I hated NSYNC and being a guy, it is my right but then that ever so catchy tune called ''Pop'' and well, I had to buy it. What I found was the most heavily produced and voice altering CD I have heard! Between the sampling and digital crap, you can hardly make out the lyrics which is probably best. If they don't want to be a boy band, they can do two things: 1. Stop doing mushy and gooey ballads 2. Write about something else other than themselves(Pop is self-righteous) or girls and dive into more lyrically challenged stuff. The CD does serve up some good tunes. Mainly, POp and The Game is Over but NSYNC has yet to find their nitch."
5,OOOO MY god it rocks,I was so pleased with the outcome of the cd It was such a good mix of uptempo and slow swaying soft music POP rocks I cant wait for there next cd to come out ...
1,HATED IT,"First, let me say the writing is excellent. Second, I HATED this book and after the second dog was beaten bloody I put my copy up for sale on Half.com. Great concept, terrible execution. I don't want to read about dogs being drowned and/or beaten in elevators. Obviously, I don't recommend the book."
4,Good primary inexpensive filter,Filters to 2.0 microns which gets most organisms and cysts. Best if used in clear stream water relatively clean. Always consider some form of purification also. Cloudy water and the like should be filtered to .2 micron then purified.
5,The Indispensable Teagarden,"This is Big Tea at his best. If you think you like Teagarden, you'll love his work after hearing this historical collection. Indispensable for the collector."
4,A good pc,Recently purchased the above mentioned hp desktop. It has worked fine for me the processor is fast. It's quiet. It's not incredibly well loaded software wise and your going to want to get viral and spamware protection but all around a good bang for the buck.
5,"June 7th,1999",his 15 mins has lasted 20 years and this is his prized jewel 4 the crowning. A-U-T-omatic.
3,I MUST ADMIT..,"I have to give 3-stars to this one because it really rocks and show the band's determination to improve. But they didn't progress in their intentions, what is a shame."
5,The best Slayer,This is my personal favorite Slayer album.Although not as fast throughout as Reign in blood.Its a more three dimensional piece of work than Reign.Songs like Silent scream and ghosts of war are a natural evolution of the Reign in blood sound.The slower side of Slayer is just as much a part of their sound as the fast material.Lombardo's drumming is amazing on here.His double bass and lighting fast rolls on Silent Scream are truly a clinic in extreme drumming.This may not be the heaviest Slayer album but its the darkest and most unique.
5,slayers best album,"I remember when I bought this album back in'88. I had heard reign in blood and thought I'd give this a try, well to tell the truth I really didn't know what to think. It didn't really sound like the other albums. At first I was kind of dissappointed! I was wanting to hear speed and angry, fast as hell riffs, but here was this sort of droning singing and chugging guitar. So I put it away for a week and wouldn't you know it I was constantly singing this album. It was stuck in my head like a cancer imbedded deep in your brain. I couldn't get it out of my head, I needed a fix. After that the mighty SLAYER!!!! has been my all time favorite. What makes this album so damn good is the lyrics, the riffs, the drumming, hell everything! It may not be the heaviest out there but if you're a true fan this album will not disappoint, and if it does its your fault for listening to an old coot like me. long live SLAYER!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,"A Few Good Tracks, Overall Average","""Mandatory Suicide"" has one of the greatest riffs ever, one of Slayer's best solos, crunching mayhem, powerful grit...""South of Heaven"" has a creepy intro that becomes darker and darker until it it explodes into a slamming riff that knocks you to the floor...""Read Between THe Lies"" has one of my personal favorite riffs ever. Its all about great riffs on this album, though, and, one has to ask, where is this quarter trying to go with this album? Slayer is Slayer, but, the way ""Seasons"" and ""Show of Mercy"" hit me as deep, dark, infernos, this one is just brutal...it lacks some of the emotions of those other albums. Tom is average with the lyrics and vocals, the solos are standard, these songs don't fit together. After about 10 listens, this album becomes a pair of shoes...you take one of the great songs, you rock it, then you throw it back on your CD pile. NOthing really uplifting here."
1,shindig presents british invasion part 2 vhs,"just like the first part of this british invasion series, the 30 minute running time for this vhs is not worth the price. this video is fit for the archives alone and not for viewing enjoyment. i highly recommend the ""hullabaloo"" dvd collection series instead which presents complete t.v. shows and has a running time of almost 5 hours which is worth the price of this dvd."
1,DO NOT PURCHASE,This arrived bent and looked just awful. The plastic is cheap and looks it. Don't waste your money.
3,Arrived with small creases and pockmarks,I like the size of this pad as I wanted to put several sheets of my weekly schedule side by side underneath it. It is thinner than I had anticipated and arrived with small pockmarks and creases in it that I find slightly annoying.
1,No ADHESIVE - Just a very thin clear plastic sheet JUNK,"No ADHESIVE - Just a very thin clear plastic sheetI was very dissappointed to find that there is no adhesive to attach this to the desk. It's too thin to just lay on the desk and expect it to stay in place. It's really the same plastic they sell in small sheets to laminate letter size paper. I had to tape it down with heavy duty sealing tape to my desk to get it to stay in place. I new it would be thin because it's so cheap, I only purchased it because it's the only deskmat that's big enoughfor my desk.And yes, it came with creases, marks and the edge bent. Easily gets creased and marked. Just a cheap thin piece of clear plastic. Just like the clear plastic book covers for binding reports in High School. DON'T BUY IT!"
1,Disappointing,"The heating was uneven, making my project a lot of work because of lack of heat and then melting the bit when there was too much heat. I threw it away after finishing the project."
5,Really good burner,"I was looking for a burner that would give me more power to work on oak woods. I burn personalized wood signs and a lot of them have large letters that get filled in and it not only takes forever to do that with a smaller burner from a craft store but it also puts a lot of strain on you hand. Upon reading some of these reviews, a lot of the reviews said that the burner tends to burn for a while and then it stops. I specifically bought this one for a project that I was working on burning cup scouts arrow plaques. The project took a month to make all of the signs and the burned did excellent. The tips seem to be a lot more robust and you have few more options than what comes with the burned from the craft store. From now on, I will only be buying this burner."
1,NOT for stencil cutting,"I bought this for stencil cutting, but this is definitely not made for that. The tip that it has for stencil cutting, is very fine, but still burns a lot more of the plastic than needed, so the images don't look as they should, and you don't even know what's the image supposed to be.I guess it's good for wood burning and other tasks. It comes in a hard small case, and the size is very convenient and practical."
3,Morality in building,"The best part of this book is its historical photos, a history of our society told by its buildings. Worst part is its premise: that once we understand the importance of adaptability in buildings, we will build differently.The fact remains building owners will never pay more than is necessary to meet their forseeable needs. (And if it weren't for building codes, even health and safety would be compromised.)Another point: Although he values ordinary buildings, and wants an architecture free of pretense, pretense of some sort is the essence of architecture, which, as Frank Lloyd Wright said, begins where function ends. Do we really want a world of plain utilitarian structures?So the book ends up being more of a criticism of our short-sighted culture, using buildings as examples. The arguments may not hold water, but the vast amount of research that obviously went into this book to document how buildings change over the decades still makes it interesting."
3,Great nuggets in a misguided Philosophy,"I've learned a lot from Brand's commonsensical, and in some ways, humanist approach. The delight he takes in the messy business of human life is exemplary. However, he sets up a false opposition - there's no real conflict between buildings which adapt and flow with change, and the grandeur of enlightenment monumentalism. The latter will undoubtedly benefit from paying more attention to flexibility, but needn't completely pack its bags in the process. I'm just back from the Sky Garden in Osaka - really, there's nothing Brand's wider philosophy could approve of in such a modernist temple, but it embodies aspects of humanity that an avowedly low-key architecture never could. For all that, HBL should be compulsory reading for all kinds of designers and engineers. Cheers!"
4,Nice cases,"cool colors especially since they matched up with the cd's themselves (totally by accident).Two of these arrived cracked in the packaging so I threw those out. Could have been the fault of the shippers. Who knows. If that hadn't happened, I probably would have given 5 stars."
3,Not an ideal package but still worthwhile...,"Yasmine Evans burst upon the UK house music scene in the late 80's as a featured vocalist for Coldcut before striking out on her own. All the hits from the glory days are represented here, but that's when the collection begins to go south. Evidently, Yazz didn't want to be classified as just a dance diva, so she ventured into limp UK r&b (think Eternal and the other new jill swing divas from the early 90's) as well as reggae. Unfortunately, her audience didn't follow suit.My main critcism with this collection is that is doesn't include two singles, ""One True Woman"" and ""Abandon Me."" Too many cover versions and album tracks pad out this collection, which is a shame. We also get an updated remix of ""The Only Way is Up,"" which is nice, but again, non-essential."
5,"Quick delivery, nothing broken.","I read some of the reviews about how some cases were received broken. Well, 100% of mine were fine, in perfect shape! So thanks for the good packing job.Used the cheapest shipping method, and it took about a week to arrive after ordering, just fine with me.Thanks!"
4,Fine jewel cases for the money,"These are a bit flimsy, but are a great deal if you just need some lightweight cases to use for storing CDs or DVDs. Some of the previous reviewers mentioned that a large number of their cases were broken on arrival, but mine were packed very well and all of them arrived intact."
5,Fantastic Bargain!,"These CD Jewel Cases were just what I was looking for. They have the colored trays and the clear covers, which is not always explained in the description. The price is a real bargain and I have not found a single bad unit in the pack of 100. I will definitely look for these again when it is time to buy more."
3,Important for understanding the essence of the Olympics.,"I read the book by V.Simson and A.Jennings with professional interest, because I am a teacher of the Olympic History in the Kuban State Academy of Physical Education. It is hard to characterize it from one point of view. On my opinion, the book describes the ""revers"" side of the Olympic Movement and what is very important for readers and especially for researches. Now it is possible to compare the traditional concept of the Olympic Movement (D.Miller, R.MacAloon, N.Müller, J.Lucas, O.Shantz, K.Lennartz and others) with the new facts and data, sometimes very controversal. I can't agree with authors in several items, but the whole book gives us a result of hard work. That's why I recommend my students and now all readers to take this book and to read carefully in order to form their own position about the Olympic Movement and it's future."
3,OK - But thank god they went back to the basics with Divine.,"The songs on here are for people who are not avid thrashers, but like heavy music. Slayer fans listening to this will always have the nagging thought in the back of their mind that they should be playing this FASTER. South of Heaven worked. This didnt quite work - AND PLEASE WILL KELLY WHATS HER NAME ('I LOOK FOR PASSION') STOP REVIEWING SLAYER ALBUMS IF YOU DONT LIKE SLAYER"
5,slayer last influental album!!!,"another awesome album to end the 80s,this album is slayers last influental album to date.things start with war ensemble whick kicks major ASS!!!! guitar riffs are great,vocals kill,and the drumming is is good,dave lombardo is so talented on drums!!.all the other songs are good too,and this album is a great follow-up to south of heaven.this album does have some slow songs in it..but unlike south of heaven i thought the slow songs here were awesome!!!.this is just almost as good as reign in blood so if your a HUGE die-hard slayer fan get this masterpeice of thrash metal,if you dont have it you can go listen to limp bizkit(limp bizket is the worse band ever ugh!!)"
4,Good heavy metal stuff but vocal is weak,"I bought this album because I am a heavy metal fan (Guns N Roses, Scorpions...) and everybody here gave high ratings. Well, I think they are some what biased. They were either used to this kind of thrash metal or like the lyrics. I personally don't listened to the lyrics and pay more attention to overall sound with strong vocal. In that respect this album fails some what. I really liked their guitar (sounds like two guitars) sound but the singer (I don't konw who the singer is) can't sing. He sounds some what like Pantera. All he does is shout. His vocal range is always within 1 octave. Overall, I must say this album is OK to listen to for a heavy metal fan but no way meets the standards of Guns' N Roses or Black Sabbath."
4,"This is ""for real"" as in earlier days.","Why can't Trouble be active today with a sound from the year 2011. I like modern metal music. Heavy and loud with high quality sound. Drums, bass, vocal and guitars and guitars and more guitars. The songs on this record are great but the quality of the sound is poor.I started with Black Sabbath, Led Zeppelin and Deep Purple in 1971. Trouble is in the same league 20 years later. Nostalgic, yes but so what?"
1,Disappointing,"This product is WAY over priced for what you get. It doesn't include the food shown in every product picture and the entire kit fits into a 10""x10"" box. The pieces look stamped giving it a really cheap and very flimsy feel. If I had seen it in the stores I would have priced it at under $10.00. It was embarrassing so I ended up going to the store and finding a nicer gift for less cost. Save your money!"
4,Adorable and Great Quality,"I'm all about quality and this little play set has it. The colors are adorable and the pieces are made to last, I just hope they don't get lost. My daughters loves playing with them and they stay in her little play kitchen all the time. I would definitely recommend."
3,Not worth the price,"This cook set is not worth the price, and no food comes with it. cheap plastic. thank god it was a gift or id be very upset."
5,My Little Chef,"We bought this set for our daughter when she was 14-months. She loves the cookware so much and she uses every piece of the set. She loves to stir pretend things in the pots, then gives us a taste, to which we must reply ""mmmmmm."" We've only had the cookware for a few months, but all of the pieces seem to be durable and are withstanding my daughter's constant play."
3,Same size scale as most pretend kitchens,"I'm going to immediately jump into the Pros/Cons for this product:Pros:1 - Size is scaled to the same ratio as many pretend kitchens (such asFisher-Price Dora Fiesta Favorites Kitchen)2 - Comes with 5 utensils - most are uncommon to find in other sets3 - One of the pots has a locking lid (twists into the handles to secure it)Cons:1 - It does not come with the food pictured - not a single piece2 - The frying pan doesn't match the pots (Why would it be green w/ pink when the pots are blue with pink?)Final input - there is nothing ""wrong"" with this set. For me, it was the utensils that was the high point. The mismatch color of the frying pan from the rest of the set (sans the utensils that had green handles) bothers me some. That said, I would likely consider theKidKraft Metal Accessories Setinstead - it looks much nicer and includes some play food as well."
2,An adequate resource guide to USA's Rail-Trails,"""1000 Great Rail-Trails"" lists USA's rails-to-trails conversions throughout all 50 states and Washington, DC. About 2/3rds of the rail-trails have a smooth surface (asphalt or smooth gravel) acceptable to mosts trail users like bicycles, mountain bicycles, walkers, roller bladers and wheelchair users. The other 1/3rd tend to have a rougher gravel and/or ballast surface and could be difficlut to many trail users. The book is well organized with the listing of each trail featuring the name, length, surface, general location, address and/or phone number for each trail. Further information for detailed trail resources lacks."
3,VANITY 6 DOES A FUNKY NEW WAVE THANG!,"This is a very fun album that captures the very strong PRINCE creative era circa the early eighties. This album, was performed by PRINCE as far as most of the instruments are concerned, with VANITY,SUSAN MOONSIE and BRENDA BENNETT on the vocals. The music is funky, with some rock, and first rate New Wave music to groove to as well. I really dig the concept and sound of an all-girl group as well. This music, also captures the feel and the year 1982 very well. My favorite tracks are: ""BITE THE BEAT"",""DRIVE ME WILD"",""IF A GIRLS CALLS"" and ""HE'S SO DULL"".If you are a PRINCE fan,I think that you should check this album out because it was recorded during a very strong prolific era for PRINCE's music,(In my opinion his best) which was during the awesome ""1999"" album and THE TIME's great second album;"" WHAT TIME IS IT?"". That cat PRINCE showed that black folks can do NEW WAVE, and still make FUNKY!"
3,Missing Vital Feature,"Just bought this phone for my wife. Wanted it because I like v-tech, style of the phone was awesome, reminds me of my motorola sliver. However my wife wanted to use if for her home office and a big mistake on v-techs part, no headset jack!!!! Why is that, I thought all phones these days came with something so simple. No I have to return it, and get something I really don't, just to get a headset jack."
3,These Handsets show a lot of promise but leave a lot to be desired,"This phone set looks stylish and is pretty good as a concept. However, there are a few issues which the phone / handset has1. Its buttons are not push buttons but click buttons like on a moto rokr. Makes it a pain to dial numbers.2. The address book capacity is good but storing numbers in the address book is a chore. There should have been a way to sync those between the handsets and a PC3. The battery life on these handsets was very bad with the original batteries which came along with the phone. It improved a lot once I replaced the batteries.4. These phones are very conducive to damage due to dampness. One of the handset acts quirky during thunderstorms if I leave the windows open. I have also faced problems with that handset if I leave it next to the humidifier in winter. The other handset works fine."
1,Another dead battery!,"I bought the set from Costco around 18 months ago and they have all died. Phone will show full charge and a few seconds after being picked up will drop connection and show a dead battery. This happened with two of the handsets and I thought the third was ok, it has hardly ever been used, but now it's showing the issue as well. Even though the handset has never been used, ok maybe two hours in 18mo, it also has the problem! Did Vtech build in a kill timer?? I'm never buying from them again."
1,TERIBLE Battery Life!,"Phone looks flashy and all, but Battery Life is EXTREMELY Bad, I cant even leave it off the hook for 1 day with little or even No calls made on it. Aside from that, nothing overly great about features either. There's better phones out there for the same price that can handle more than a day's use."
1,A real rip-off,"I'll say, first off, that the basic phone system has been fine for my needs. I'm not a power user and have not used any additional functions. I think the phones are sleek and stylish, and they work fine. I bought the basic base station and single extra handset to see how I liked it, and I liked it well enough I wanted to upgrade to more handsets. The product description right here at amazon says: ""upgradable to include additional handsets""But amazon does not seem to offer any way to get additional handsets. So I googled, and no matter what I looked at or where I could *NOT* find additional handsets, which I now need. I finally broke down and called Vtech. They told me you can *ONLY* get additional handsets when you buy the base station initially. You can't add handsets later. I consider that a major rip-off and will never buy from Vtech again."
1,VTech,"Had to send the vtech back because the phones would not hold a charge they sent a replacement but these phones will not tell you when there is another phone in house is on line,they are replaceing it have not rec'd it yet."
5,Very nice phone,"This really is a nice phone. I wans't sure if I would like the keypad, but it is convenient and easy to use. It is easy to set up and best of all, there absolutly no interferance while on the phone."
2,Extra used,"The phone is great however, beware of buying used products. I love Vtech phones, but brand new not used. One handset does not work at all. Both phones have scratches and the voicemail does not work. Extremely annoyed!"
2,Not wall mountable!,"I was so excited when I got this phone. It looked sleek and sophisticated. But there was a HUGE problem...it's not wall mountable. This is the first phone I have ever bought that can't be mounted to the wall! What were they thinking????? I don't like the phone on the counter, it just looks messy. I had to send it back. I'm very disappointed, but I got the Panasonic 6.0 instead, at least their engineers are thinking."
5,The best race car action on earth,"You want to see your almost every day car on your every day roads going as fast as they can.Than try this video and you'll be hook,you won't believe your eyes.And all this in a video made like a television serie,where each race adds up to the championship,you won't be able to live your t.v for two hour.I almost have every year of the FIA World rally Championship videos,i want them all because it's the best racing acting there is."
5,"Quick delivery, interesting stories","I haven't completed reading yet, but the first few stories have been fascinating. The book arrived in perfect shape, and in a very timely manner. I would order again."
4,A Misfits reborn,"Danzig, taken out of one Misfits rib, a few times great vocalists leave a legendary band to crate a new one , a new legend , examples: Lee Dorrian leaves Napalm Death to form Cathedral, Bill Steer leaves Carcass to put together Firebird and Glen Danzig leaves Misfits to give birth to Danzig, awesome vocals , a mixture between Elvis and Morrison, with sabathesque influences in musical terms , ""mother"" is quite a classic , ""twist of cain"" deligthfull, ""possesion"" overwhelming, a true unique sound , 70 s sound with dark influencesgreat album, you have to taste this band.Trust me.HM"
2,Gets old quick,"This is the first and last Danzig album I'll own (and I'm thinking about selling it.) The popular and yet mediocre tracks like Mother have become beyond boring and over played on rock stations. As for the rest of the album that is less than mediocre, it seems it was thrown together without much creativity. It could be said, Danzig is close to being a one hit wonder. CLOSE to it. There are one or two other songs that are close to being decent; Twist of Cain being an example. I never thought much about the Misfits and Danzig is not much better. With this said, if Danzig is a leading band of Southern Rock, then this genre might be in trouble."
5,Insight and Perspective,"This book is worth the read for any serious follower of Christ and a person interested in seeing His message of hope, love and forgiveness reach all people. What believers need today is insight and perspective into current events and how the truth of God's word provides understanding, compassion, and grace to a lost world. I see this book putting an exclamation mark on the need for the church to double its effort to reach out to all people every where!"
4,Good Book,This is a very good book. I am much more aware and in tune with the current events in the Muslim world since reading this book. The most troubling part of all of this is that I am seeing current events happen that could plausibly lead to many of the scenarios that the author explores-sde
4,Excellent Read,"This is a must read for anyone living in America. You don't have to be interested in end-times. This book was published in 2005 and he is so dead on about his guesses and their actual outcomes in 2008 it's almost like he had a crystal ball. America has got (!) to decrease it's dependence on Middle East oil. Since the author was sooo correct about some of his suppositions it will be interesting to see how much more comes to fruition. There are a few chapters that seem like same stuff is being hashed over, but on the whole I can't say enough good."
1,Ridiculously overpriced,"Product is very good and I have been using it for years - I used to buy it Williams Sonoma which no longer carries it. I bought it at this site though I thought it was a bit expensive. Later a friend suggested to check at Sur La Table - sure enough the same size bottle costs $6.95, less than half the price paid on Amazon."
4,hghlander/raven,Enjoyed the show when it was on and now I have the chance to watch it again. Lots of Highlander energy and a good time!
5,Cool Reggae,I like this album. It reminds me of real reggae played by real musicians. I wish music could rock like that again.
5,Outstanding!,"By publishing ""Red"", Black Uhuru locate themselves in the 2nd position on my favorite reggae artists list, along with Israel Vibration, right after The Wailers.The combination between Michael Rose's lyrics, Puma's speciale voice and the excellent performance of accompanists Sly&Robbie, creats an impressive, almost perfect result.Highly recommended!"
3,"Not without merit, but doesn't fully congeal","The Bottom Line:All the principals are very good and the stark photography by David Gordon Green is impressive but the disparate storylines don't really come together in the end and Kate Beckinsale's actions at a pivotal juncture seem hard to understand; I enjoyed watching this drama and found many parts to appreciate, but taken as a whole Snow Angels is too flawed to recommend without qualification.2.5/4"
2,Movie sucked Beckinsales hot,"What can i say, the movie was pathetic. Hollywood has absolutely no talent working there anymore, the actors and actresses have the ability to do wonderful, theres no producers and directors and writers with any creativity or talent to speak of or mention.BUT beckinsales IS hot"
3,Butterfly Ring,"I bought this ring for my daughter for her high school graduation, it is very pretty but small. I thought from the picture it would be larger? My daughter loved it so I guess all is well, but I think that these rings should be shown at actual size."
1,"If you're going to buy Hellsing, don't get this version","Quick comment on this release, not the Hellsing TV series. DO NOT BUY the product featured on this page. It is a pirated, ""bootleg"" release. The real Hellsing R1 DVD release was on 4 DVDs from the late great Geneon Entertainment. FX, on the other hand, is a known bootlegging operation, and none of the money you give them will reach the artists or actors who worked on this series. Aside from the moral/ethical concerns, you will get worse audio/visual quality from this release, since it has 13 episodes crammed onto 2 DVDs."
4,Refreshingly evil,One of the things I love about Hellsing is the purity of Arucard's evil. He isn't a romantic vampire as one finds in other series. The anime is imaginative. A resfreshing spin on vampires.
5,Great Sale,"I never actually got to watch the DVDs myself, since they were my boyfriends' xmas gift, but HE sure gave it the thumbs up~!It came new just as I ordered it and just in time.If I ever want a box set, I'm using shawnek! :D"
5,Great show,"For any one in to good action with a good plot line to it this is a good bet for you. This show is a bit more grafic than the anime most people in this country are used to, but it's not as bad as Ninja Scroll, or others along that line. All and all it's 13 episodes of realy good anime."
3,Sweet collection of stories designed to enhance faith,"For anyone who adamantly believes in the power of God and His helpers, or at least continues to have faith that acts of kindness are possible in a world overrun by violence and turmoil, Angel Country offers an outlet of that faith and offers the theory that perhaps there is indeed a benefit to prayer. One need not look to Maine to find angels, but as Biley believes, it is not a bad place to start."
3,"Pretty disappointed, but an OK Lyle is better than most","As a huge LL fan, I must say I was disappointed in this release. Maybe it was the wait, maybe it's the slower pace of most of the songs. Whatever it is, it's just not LL at his best. Many songs are repetitive - have you heard ""Cute as a Bug""? I can't honestly see myself reaching for this CD over ""Ensanada"" or ""Large Band"" perhaps ever.With all of that being said, he's still Lyle Lovett! The voice is as good as ever and the variety of music and moods will probably give you a few songs you'll like.-If you're new to Lyle start elsewhere (my vote would be Ensanada).-If you're a big fan you'll probably get this anyway.-If you're a casual fan, I wouldn't say ""don't"" get this, but if you're eyeing a few more CDs and you're on a budget - this one can wait."
4,"A descriptive, fascinating read","I really enjoyed this book. After I saw a special on Lillian Helllman on PBS, I purchased this book. She led a fascinating life and her immediate friends...Dorothy Parker and lovers...Dashiell Hammett confirmed this. Pentimento takes you through time as you visit her family in New Orleans, her friends in New York and London and her deep resentment and bitterness over the McCarthy era...that caused her to suffer greatly because she would not bend to their will. She was an amazing woman, who led an amazing life and Pentimento delves deep into the characters of her life that made an impact. Pentimento is a great read and find."
4,Inspirational and specific,"This guide, by pioneer Jaime Jackson, stands among the best natural hoof care guides, with enough photos and detailed drawings to help demystify even the hoof mechanisms of blood circulation and hoof wall loading. I have already been trimming my own horse for a year, but now I feel increased confidence about my trimming techniques, and an even clearer mental image of the goal of balance and natural wear for my horse.I also recommend very highly any of Pete Ramey's books, probably the most famous of Mr. Jackson's proteges."
3,Least favorite of a brilliant author...,"Barry Unsworth is one of my favorite authors, and I have read all his books. This was my least favorite. What ""unites"" the disparate characters are simply a road which passes by their houses and (ubiquitously) a lawyer whom they each consult. Although Unsworth's use of historical context and detail is usually one of the most enjoyable and well developed aspects of his novels, here we are dealing, peripherally, with battles involving both Hannibal (who craftily fought off the Romans) and the Fascists (who left this part of Italy devastated).Having spent time in the Italian countryside, I could relate somewhat to the details that Unsworth relates about the land and the feel of the environment however; the book itself just doesn't have a central core. Having said all that, however, I'd still rather read a lesser Unsworth book than most books on the bestseller list"
4,A refreshing novel,"I picked up this book not knowing what to expect. It started off slow but once I got into it I couldn't put it down! Its fast moving, exciting, and it makes you think. It amazing that this is the author's first novel. I would recommend this book to anyone who like a mystery/thriller book."
5,Outstanding novel,"I think this was an outstanding book. It kept me on my seat wondering what was going to happen next. I could not put this book down. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes excitement, and mystery. I hope to see more like this one."
2,Cathy's review,"I was very disappointed with this book. I hate reading a book and having questions about what happened to the characters at the end. The author had way too many things going on in this book. It is almost as if he wanted to included every idea he has ever had in his life in one book. Additionally, the verse was way too poetic. The subject matter was not beautiful, so it was unneccessary to use the imagery that he did. In my opinion, there were just too many things going on in this book and its a shame that they went unresolved. This book would have been just as good if it was half the length."
1,Unrealistic to the extreme,"Which of Bowdoin's fraternities kicked Rob Kean out? And why did he leave Bowdoin before he graduated? (The jacket copy says he ""attended."") My husband, a Bowdoin alumnus, refused to read this book beyond the first chapter saying that it bore absolutely no resemblance to his experience.People have commented about the unrealistic characters of Mark and Shawn. How long would a college of the stature of ""Simsbury"" put up with a dean like Templeton or a befuddled president?Also, if Sigma were indeed the all-powerful, brothers-to-the-end, world-controlling fraternity it is made out to be, why was it that NONE of the Simsbury College trustees was a Sigma?"
1,"Wordy, Disappointing, Elitist Rhetoric","Like a movie of the week, this one droned on and on never really managing to break the surface of what was behind all the hatred. (Someone give Kean a hug.) This book is far too jaded for someone with so much promise (as the book jacket claims). How many times can a reader tolerate phrases such as ""partying like rock stars"" without it sounding hackneyed?"
3,Should have been about 100 pages shorter,"Good book, but not great. I would have preferred alot less description and more story. If you want to revisit your college years, might help some."
4,Very helpful!,"Briefly, if you're looking to learn the basics of sound-reinforcement - buy it; if you already know the basics but want to fill in some gaps; buy it.Great book."
3,An Addictive Read,"I love a good mystery and of course Agatha Christie is the queen of mystery! While I'd classify this book as light reading, it's certainly not frivolous. The story is well-crafted, with several twists and turns that will keep you guessing from beginning to end. You'll fall in love with the characters Tommy and Tuppence and you won't want to leave the exciting world that THE SECRET ADVERSARY creates around them."
4,Keeps you guessing till the end.,"The Secret Adversary by Agatha Christie is our introduction to Tommy and Tuppence. After not seeing each other for several years, they run into each other and since both are almost broke, they decide to form a company called The Young Adventurers, Ltd. Quite by accident, they stumble upon a situation involving the government. Hired to work the case, they are joined by a rich American, looking for his cousin who is involved in the case Tommy and Tuppence are working on. Their goal, to save the government from ruin and track down the elusive Mr. Brown. Christie keeps you guessing to the very end as to who the mysterious Mr. Brown is, and I will admit, I pegged the wrong character."
2,Awful,I was surprised to find this novel so boring. Tedious. It is not the style of Agatha Christie. I kept checking the cover page to ensure that Christie was the author.
4,secret adversary,I love Agatha so it was a no brainer. She never disappoints me in any of her books that she writes She is a classic
3,Weak Tommy and Tuppence,"I love Tommy and Tuppence as they age -- thoughtful, careful, smart. However, this (early) work is a bit of let down. The plot isn't that great and their characters are more cliched than they are as they grow older. I was disappointed."
2,A real let-down.,"Let me start by saying I do like Agatha Christie, but this effort was quite weak. Problem? The Advesary isn't a secret! Halfway through the novel it becomes clear that the mystery person can only be one of two people. Typically A.C. makes things much more uncertain. I was dissappointed."
2,Childish,Read as tho written to a teen age girl. Why should I have to wire 11 more words about something.
3,Cheery cozy,"I quick read starring Tommy and Tuppence. It takes place after The Great War, a former soldier and nurse who were childhood friends are currently unemployed. They decide to become Adventurers and put an add in the paper. That is where all the action begins. They race to find a missing girl and stay steps ahead of the international criminal ""Mr. Brown""."
4,Nice air core pad,"I liked the Big Agnes air core pad. For comfort, it is great. Used it in 30 degree night, and was still pretty cold, but way better than my former sleeping pad."
2,Really for kids with food aversions,"I'm sure this book has great information for those of you dealing with kids with strong food aversions (e.g. kids who only eat 3-4 things). But if you're looking for advice on getting a finicky eater to try more foods, this isn't that book. Luckily we seem to be moving past the reluctance to try foods, so I'm not going to worry about it, but this book is being donated or passed on since I won't be using it."
5,A GREAT SPARK PLUG!,"I have been using these spark plugs on Toro recyclers for years. They are wonderful! In fact, they are better than the Toro Mowers!! And they have a lifetime warranty which will be honored at any auto parts store that carries them. Before I found these spark plugs, I was buying multiple Champion plugs at a time to keep my mowers running! And Amazon has a wonderful price!"
3,good japanese visual rock band,"Not as good 'n' poppy as ""Ark"", but there are some good songs: most notably, ""Shinshoku [Lose Control]"", which reminds me a little of Smashing Pumpkins and Cure.Complete Track Listing: 1. Shi no Hai [Ashes of Death] 2. It's The End 3. Honey 4. Sell My Soul 5. Snow Drop (Ray Mix) 6. L'heure 7. Kasou [Flower Funeral] 8. Shinshoku - Lose Control 9. Trick 10. Ibara no Namida [Cry of Thorns] 11. The Silver Shining"
5,Pretty close to their best,"I disagree with those who consider this one of their ""middling"" albums. Every song on the album is pretty strong. I can do without the title song--""Heifer whines could be human cries...."" Tracks 1 through 5, played in succession, are as strong as anything the Smiths ever did and flow really well. ""How Soon Is Now"" is a great, if overplayed, song. ""Nowhere Fast"" and ""Well I Wonder"" are also great songs. Anyways, this album with their last 2 studio albums, ""The Queen is Dead,"" and ""Strangeways, Here We Come"" cemented the Smiths as one of the greatest bands of their time. Add in, their singles collections and they were amazing."
4,Why over-the-top?,"I think this album is really really good. A lot of the songs say things which are in my humble opinion critically important to humanity.The song Meat Is Murder is powerful and frightening but also heartfelt, so I don't see why it is ""over-the-top"". Whilst I do believe in freedom of choice, Morrissey's opinion is being put forward, I think, in the interests of reducing suffering. Just because it is difficult to listen to doesn't make it over-the-top IMO. I don't normally make bold statements or submit reviews, but this was important to me."
1,Don't Bother,"Easily the worst and most disappointing album in the Smiths' catalog. Here the group tries to tackle every cause under the sun, and come up with an album that sounds flat and uninspired. There isn't even one song on the album I can recommend. There are some good Smiths albums, notably The Queen is Dead. Meanwhile, Meat is Murder, like a rotting carcass, should be given a wide berth."
2,"Vinyl does NOT include ""How Soon is Now?""","VINYL BUYERS BEWARE!! The vinyl version DOES NOT include ""How Soon is Now?"" and is actually the original UK version of the vinyl. I hate to say that I specifically purchased an album for one song, but I am guilty of that, and was really looking forward to jamming this particular song with my friends. Unfortunately the vinyl is missing this single, even though the product description says U.S. version!So, if you are looking for ""How Soon is Now?"" on vinyl, try to locate the U.S. version, not the UK.Otherwise the rest of this album is pretty mediocre, sonics aren't that great and it doesn't really make me want to get up and jump around like most albums should.Oh well... what's $28? (That was sarcasm)."
2,Not for Me,"First the good points: the kettle is hefty stainless, it feels good and sturdy; the design is nice looking. Now the bad: the whistle is low toned, like a loooong tooooooot on a tugboat, but much-much-much softer, sometimes nearly inaudible; like a previous reviewer, mine drips from the spout when boiling; and the worst of it is you need two hands to pour - one to hold the handle, the other to lift the spout lid. With my old kettle the thumb of the hand holding the handle could push a lever and lift the pouring lid, while with this one the lever is too far away and you need to lift the pouring lid with your other hand. Also the lever is too near the escaping steam making for a hot thumb. I will be returning mine tomorrow."
5,Amazing toy!,"The detail in this toy is amazing and my animal afficionado son adores his Brachiosaurus. The only drawback is how heavy it is! But then again, that is why the toy is so incredibly durable. If you are willing to spend this much on a toy for your kid, you won't be disappointed!"
2,Nauseating love story,"I watched the Spiderman cartoon as a kid and I don't remember the love story behind it all being rammed down my throat the way it was in this movie. Granted I didn't read the comic book, so perhaps it was more of a theme there. I thought they went way too overboard with the love story in this movie. I don't have a problem with love stories, but I didn't go to watch Spiderman for the romance. For the amount of action that did happen in the movie, it was great. Willem Dafoe is awesome. No doubt about that. I recommend people see him in the movie Shadow of the Vampire if they liked him in Spiderman. Toby McGuire did a good job too, even though the guy had to spit out the most nauseating romantic lines I've heard in quite a while. But Kirsten Dunst, talented actress that she is, just didn't seem the best suited to the role that she played. I think the movie could have been a lot better if they had chopped out 50% of the romance and substituted it with more action."
1,"Bad Acting, Bad fx, Bad Love Story, Bad Pace!","I used to love reading Spider-Man comic books, and was excited when I heard about a movie version of the classic super-hero. Unfortunately, Sam Raimi's Spider-Man is just plain bad. It's boring! The story moves at a snails pace and the action scenes are way too short. That wouldn't be SO bad if the plot were interesting or the love scenes half-way decent, but they're not. This movie won't stand the test of time, that's for sure."
2,I really didn't like this movie,"Ok, some of the movie was good, but the story line was really bad. The action scenes were kinda cool but I would have rather seen another movie."
1,I dont know why but i just cant connect with him,"I just dont get why everyone says its so good, its not.The sequel is okay, but this one just sucked."
5,Superb action movie,"I think this is the best superhero action movie since the first Batman back in 1989. I loved the visuals and the character development was superbly done. Overall great story, great movie, and it was even inspirational!"
3,Attack of the Clones was better than Spider-Man,"Ok, Spider-Man was named the summer blockbuster for 2002 and it was a great movie and more than $400 million- but does that mean it was better than Star Wars Episode II- Attack of the Clones?Not a chance.Spider-Man was ruined by William Dafoe as the green goblin. Sure, the visual effects in spider-man were compelling but it was not better than Attack of the Clones.Spider-Man was predictable and basically a glorified verison of the cartoon.If you want to see real action and adventure- see Lord of the Rings or Attack of the Clones- both are better than Spider-Man."
4,Spiderman,I liked this movie although some parts are gross. The part I liked the best was when the green goblen and Spiderman were battling. The graphics were pretty cool. I can't wait to see the second one.
1,Great stuff (if you have a 30-second attention span)!,"This film is basically representative of modern action hero films: lots of flashy computer effects propping up a predictable and lame story. In other words, it's a perfect example of how Hollywood panders to the lowest common denominator (which keeps getting lower). Those who were raised on video games, live in their Mom's basement with their comics collections, and can't pay attention to stories and characters deeper than a puddle will love it. Thankfully, I didn't have to pay to see it.Those who want engrossing stories and heroes, sans computerized eye candy, should look elsewhere. Perhaps Spartacus, El Mariachi/Desperado, or Clint Eastwood westerns?"
2,pretty average,I grew up digging SpiderMan&was waiting too see this Film.but having finally seeing it I wasn't that Moved.the effects had moments.but the StoryLine&Acting didn't do much for me.
2,WHY? WHY?????,"Ok, this is an 'ok' movie for kids. But seriously, it's HORRIBLE! I saw it as a 12:00 midnight showing for [less money] and im still [angry] about seeing it. Terrible visuals! Sam is a terrible director for several reasons. The acting is bad, the camera work is bad, perspective of things alters, and it doesn't make any sense! If spider-man DIDN'T jump out of the way at the end of the movie, the green goblin would be dead anyway! (I hope i'm ruining this for someone). However, i'm not all complaints here: from this horrible, horrible script with terrible dialog, they made an 'ok' movie. Notice how I say movie, not film..."
5,Oh Yeah!!,"This movie was great. The best part about it? The emphasis was on the story, not the special effects. I have loved Spiderman since my youth and this was a great film adaptation. It didn't vary much off the real thing, something that annoyed me about the X-MEN movie. The biggest change, and I think something that improved Spiderman, was the idea of letting Peter have web that came out of himself just like a real spider. That has always been the most annoying thing about the comic. ""Oops, I ran out of web.""I can hardly wait until the DVD is released and until the next movie."
3,50/50 split for the comic book fans,"Being and avid collector of the Spiderman comics, I was disappointed with the liberties taken to transfer the story to film... but as a fan of the comic I felt they tried to squeeze too much into 2 hours. The deviations I did not like included his origin, his discovery of his transformation and the romance with Mary Jane Watson...They should have at least left in the webshooters that he invented. Now for what I did like about the movie. His transformation happening over night makes more sense than the comic. His learning curve on swinging from his webs were funny and more 'realistic'. The special effects and action scenes were awesome to say the least. The Green Goblin costume was a passable interpretation of the comic, but a bit hokey. Randy Savage as the wrestler was a humorous casting and a welcome interpretation...Over all I liked the movie...it is a fine movie, but you'll find yourself longing for more"
3,Just so so,"Yesterday i bought Spiderman and The sum of all fears and Ice age and Jason x and windtalker and enough's DVD .When i've never seen these DVD , I thought that Spider man's DvD must best DVD in these DVD , But when i have seen these DVD ,I realize Spider man's DVD is worst Dvd in these DVD . ( Just only 2 MTVS is ok .Sum41 and saliva are cool . Of course slayer's King are awesome .) Anyway i REALLY think Spider man'S DEBUT ISN'T PERFECT MOVIE .I will waiting for Spiderman's episode 2 :)"
2,Probably the Only one,"I am probably the only one who doesn't like Spider-Man. I did not like this movie for two reasons, the first reason was the special effects were really bad and most of the time you could see how fake it looked on the movie screen and imagine how it will look on television, the second reason was The Green Goblin he was not convincing as a villian and he wasn't even scary. It even took a little from Batman(1989) in the parade scene when Macy Gray sings and in Batman Prince sings. I'm sorry to people who love this movie but I just don't like this movie at all."
2,Not as Bad as the 2nd But still...,"This is by far NOT the BEST COMIC movie at all!!! But Not the worst, Superman in the 70's was worse, then the old school Batman from the 60's, then these Spidy movies, then Hulk, then the last 2 Batman movies of the 90's series, then X-men, then the first 2 Batman movies of the 90's, then THE BEST COMIC MOVIE EVER IS THE NEW BATMAN BEGINS, go see that if you want a truly good comic movie with surprisingly no corneyness at all...thats a first for comics!"
4,See it. K?,"The movie is superb. Many critics say the cheesy straight-from-the-comic lines degrade the film, but I think it helps the movie stay true to the comic."
4,Totally great,"This movie is totally great, but being a 12 year old, I don't get the ending. THat's that only part I don't really like. The rest is like, COOL MAN!!!!!!!!!"
4,He's SPIDER-MAN!,"Did the film versions of ""Superman"" and ""Batman"" successfully capture the quintessence of their respective heroes? Yes, they did. Does this movie? You bet it does! Many times during this film I sat there and quietly nodded: ""They got it right.""After reading the reviews I was afraid the film was perhaps not the equal of the trailer; it is. Only someone as staid as the movie critic (most of them) would not be enormously pleased with this production.The story is told flawlessly and dramatically. The effects are very good indeed. One critic complained that Spiderman looks like a character in a video game jumping around; he doesn't. Many of the scenes are quite breath-taking.The actors keep pace, never dropping the ball.Forget ""Star Wars"" -- see this movie instead. It won't disappoint. Four and a half stars, to be exact."
2,Good and Bad,"The acting is great. The computer animation is awful. Every time Kristen Dunst comes on screen, the camera focuses on her chest..."
1,$$$,Here's another example of CGI junk food.They aim this at kids to make big bucks. They serve up computer graphics and fill it in the rest with silly comic book antics.Yet another marketing tool that's not science just fiction.Effects and violence are no substitute for art.
3,Spiderman,"This movie is very overrated! I didnt really like it! First of all, if the whole freakin movie wasnt Peter flying around on his little webby web, it would have been better! Every scene was the same, a cityperson gets in trouble, and then, oh no look up, here comes Spideyman on his little webby web and he saves the day for the millionth time! Second of all, the web looked SO FAKE when he was on it! Only recommended if you are a fan of the cartoon, or the comic books.**1/2"
3,"Lot of fun to watch, seems faithfully done, buy for extras","I'm not so wowed by this movie as some people seemed to be but I did think it was pretty good. The plot seems to do a good job of following what I remember of the comic book plot line, the dialog is comic book in nature but all right( after all it is a comic book not real life) and the special effects seem to do all right by me. Some complain that some of the action scenes don't look right but considering that a man is being portrayed swinging on a strand of web (the spider characteristics are the biggest variance from the historical plotline)I think they were well done.I got finished with the movie wanting something more, maybe the next one will do an even better job.The extra's should be a lot of fun to see, if I get it they will be the reason."
3,Another Comic Book Hero Movie,Not a bad movie but after watching it for about the 30th time (my boys ages 5 & 3 love it) it begins to pall quite a bit. Kirsten Dunst looks awful as a redhead and there is little chemistry between the two lead characters in the romance department (except for the one kiss in the rain). Casting for Green Goblin & son were well done - lots of great stunt work and the actors look enough alike to make it believable. Cliff Robertson does a fine job but doesn't appear long enough in the movie to make much of an impact. After hearing nothing but great things about it after the theater release the actual movie was a bit of a let down but then I've never been the biggest Spidey fan in the world. If you like comic book superhero movies Xmen or Batman are much better done. This appears to be a quickly done version compared to the dark version of good vs. evil presented in other movies. Not worth a sequel!!
5,Another one of the awesome Marvel movies,"I like this movie a lot. I especially like how Tobey Maguire portrayed Peter Parker/Spder-Man and how Willem Defoe portrayed Norman Osborn/Green Goblin. The only annoying thing about the movie is Mary Jane, she screams too much and can't fight for 5 seconds. Other than that This movie is great."
2,Not My Favorite Film of 2002,"This film could have been done so much better! I'm not so sure that Tobey Maguire was the best actor for the role. Let me just say, he's not spidery enough, if that makes any sense. Christopher Reeves was superman, Jack Nicholson was Joker, Maguire is not Spiderman. The plot is somewhat duller than I expected, more of an introductory than anything, like Star Wars Episode 1. There's just not a whole lot of Spiderman Action!"
2,"*If you need a nap, go see Spider-man*","My sweety and I were so disappointed in this flop of a flick. He's a real Spidey fanatic and I had to wake him up at several points throughout the film. The only reason I managed to stay conscious was because I knew nothing about the origin of Spider-man and was driven on by curiosity. But we both found the film totally predictable and cheezy. The romance aspect of the movie was played out much to much and even the promise of exciting special effects did not follow through. The only good thing about this movie was the ever erasable Toby McGuire, who was perfect as Peter Parker. I am a big Kirsten Dunst fan, and I must say that her acting in this movie was nausiating. To lay it on the line, save yourself the money and rent it next year."
1,Dumb,"I mean, besides Tobey Maguire looking kinda fine, this movie would be more of a flop to the critics than it is to me. It's categorized as an action film - I don't see any ""heart-stopping"" action in it. It was basically a typical childish love story about a losery guy who's had a crush on a girl for a very long time and once he's become a superhero he saves her life over and over again (all of which they weren't even believable) he falls for her and she falls for him and so on.Conclusion? I want my two hours and my $... back."
3,The special features on the DVD were better than the movie,"I purchased this DVD because I went through a Marvel comic book phase when I was growing up. So I thought it might be fun to see. Reviews on the movie were reasonably good, too. However, like many movies of this genre (action-adventure-superheroes), it tries to overcome its inherent flaws in script with overdone and interminably long special effects sequences that defy all physical laws.I made the serious mistake of viewing the special features on the 2nd DVD disk first. They were very imaginative and interesting and it increased my expectations for the movie. Unfortunately, my expectations were clearly not met. My major complaint is that the script was just too thin and absolutely predictable. Are all producers/directors are still trying to recreate (copy?) the Titanic phenonmenon (see Pearl Harbor et al). Also, Kirsten Dunst looks ridiculous in a red wig. However, Tobey Maguire and Willem Dafoe were well cast. Overall an average movie."
3,Not Typical Raimi....,"Well, I helped contribute to the millions this film is making by seeing it Twice! Oh well, it is a fun film and everyone I know wants to see it so......Tobey Maguire is great, as usual, as is Willem Dafoe. Even though I'm a huge Kirsten Dunst fan, I thought her performance was a little weak. Her lines seemed to forced and ingenuine. David Koepp's screenplay was also weak in the dialogue department. Pretty corny stuff, even for a 'comic book' style film. The film's animation effects, at times, are so blantantly noticeable, I feel that I am literally watching a cartoon. But overall, it is a fun story and it was entertaining to watch Maguire's discovery of who he has become as it unfolds. *** 1/2 stars"
3,Mostly story,"This movie is two hour and one minute long and was released on May 3, 2002. The movie mainly introduces us to Peter Parker and how Spiderman came to be and how the murder of his Uncle Ben was the main turning point to become the hero Spiderman. We are introduce to the Green Goblin in Spiderman 1. The movie does stay focus; one hero and one villian, unlike Spiderman 3 where we have three villians. The one area this movie lacks is action. There are only two action scenes, maybe one more. When I was watching the video at home, I kept switching the off and on button. I just could not get into this movie."
5,SPIDER-MAN IS THE BEST COMIC BOOK MOVIE EVER!!!,"GREAT DIRECTOR!!! GREAT CAST!!! GREAT MOVIE!!!As much as I hate to admit it, when I first saw Toby Maguire I didn't think he was good enough to play Peter Parker and Spider-Man, but now that I've seen the movie, I can see I was wrong--he might even be the only actor who could have played the role!!!But Willem Dafoe nearly steals the movie as archenemy Norman Osborn/Green Goblin! And Cliff Roberston is excellent in his brief but important role as Uncle Ben--""With great power must come great responsibility.""--Kirsten Dunst is good as Mary Jane, and J.K. Simmons is fantastic as J.Jonah Jameson!!!And Sam Raimi proved to me that he's a great director, because only a great director could pull off this movie and make Spider-Man realistic by using terrific mixes of real New York street scenes and excellent special effects!!!SPIDER-MAN IS THE BEST COMIC BOOK MOVIE EVER!!! Or as Stan Lee used to say, EXCELSIOR!!!Chari KrishnanRESEARCHKING"
2,What happened?,Great visual effects coupled with a poor story line and lots of bad acting. Give me the old '60s TV cartoon over this overproduced mess any day.
1,"If your DVD player is multi-zone, DON'T BUY THIS ONE","Once again, Hollywood in their fear of not making the absolute most money on their product has programmed codes that prevent you from seeing certain films if your player is multi-zone. Don't even get me started on the insistance of Hollywood on having zones in the first place. If someone likes to see foreign films and wants to get a DVD from another zone (i.e. Europe, Japan, etc.), well, too bad for you, because where multi-zone players are common in other countries, they are relatively hard to get in the U.S., and you can't play a foreign DVD on a regular American DVD player. So, say you teach a foreign language/culture. You are out of luck if you want to show your students real films from other countries, not just the ones distributors deem profitable for U.S. release. And now, even if you own a multi-zone player you bought legally & legitimately in the U.S., you can't see certain American DVDs. ..."
5,Best Movie of 2001,"this is a movie that I would watch over and over again. There is nothing bad I can think of to say about this film. It was well writen and acted out. It's the kind of movie you can take your family, a date or see by yourself and still injoy it."
3,A cartoon movie like batman,"I watched this movie in a airplane, on a small LCD monitor, and I think that is enough for it. I don't understand why this movie can cause such an hype at all. The graphics is not that great compared with movies like Starwars, and the story is very shalow, nothing more than a comic strip like the batman. I think this movie did not live up to its hype."
5,How superhero movies are supposed to be made,"Sam Raimi Brings all the energy and excitement from His Hercules and Xena TV shows to the movie adaptation of Spider-Man. This bright, energetic film stays true to the spirit of the comics. The story is easy to follow and is full of fun campy moments that will have you laughing, and on the edge of your seat with the action packed scenes that were ripped from a comic book. Fanboys may grumble that some things are modified (Organic webshooters, Mary Jane is in Gwen Stacy's place during the final battle) but these minor cosmetic changes only improve the story. Tobey Maguire gives a great performance as does the rest of the cast. (Fans of Raimi films should Look for Lucy Lawless and Bruce Campbell in hilarous cameo roles.) This is a great film and it will get a lot of play on your DVD machine."
5,"Spider Man good, but Cartoon was better.",The movie was not a dissapointment but in my eyes the cartoon had a way better story. Many details are left in the dark during the movie. It has no sense of time. But the real kick in the groin was that he had natural web in the movie. In the comic book and the cartoon he had web cartridges. Making for a much better SpiderMan expierence. In the books and TV shows he would sometimes run out of the cartridges and have to think on his feet. One aspect in the movie that was better in the movie was better was how Peter Parker aquired the spider like abilities.(It goes in to more detail) Buy the movie if you liked the X-men movie. I would recommend the cartoon series on DVD though.
4,Spider-Man DVD,"First all of, this DVD comes in two editions identical except for the video format, one being widescreen and other normal 4:3. Buy the widescreen version. A very good video transfer with good sound, this film has a few minor plot points to quibble with and is satisfying overall. Excellent performance from Tobey Maguire demonstrating the dichotomy of his existence. The one major disappointment for me with the film is the title sequence, I was hoping for a modern version of the Spider-Man song!"
5,Easy to Cut and Good quality Twine,This looks great on my counter top and makes it easy to grab cooking twine when I need it. The cutter is great and now I don't have to look for the scissors.
3,Broken,I ordered four of these for gifts and all four had to be glued.The metal teeth that were to hold the post to the base are not nearly long enough to grip the wood and luckily I opened all of them to find them detached. My husband had to glue and clamp all four in order to give as gifts. Not exactly what I expected for the price paid!!
3,Poor quality construction,"I purchased this item which uses half-size twine spools because it would better fit on my counter.When I opened the box, the spindle was completely detached from the wood base. It wasn't ""broken"" — just fallen apart. The method of affixing the spindle to the base is via a small ring with spikes that only penetrate the wood base by 1/8"" or less. Hardly durable or sturdy.Rather than go through the hassle of returning and gambling on a replacement unit arriving in the same condition, I used some Elmer's wood glue and fixed a brand new product that shouldn't have required fixing. The manufacturer should be ashamed for selling such a poorly constructed product."
4,enjoy cooking,"I only gave this 4 stars cause something has to be awesomely excepttional for me to give 5. If you cook a lot whether beef, chicken, pork or anything you have to tie this is a very good thing to have in your kitchen. I cook outside alot and on rotisserie (I have a ronco for inside and onegrill for out) and this is a must have. The twine is strong and ther is a lot of it so I dont have to worry about running out anytime soon. The cutter on top keeps me from having to reach for the scisors repeatedly."
1,What a rip-off!,"I bought 3 sets of these sheets, and all of them are way too small for the mattresses they were made for, even before washing & drying. It's a huge struggle to just get the fitted sheet to cover the mattress, only to have it pop off a few seconds later. Also, the material is so thin, you can see through it, and it's not nearly as soft as the other jersey knit sheet sets I've had. On the queen size set we bought, they didn't even bother to make the 2 pillowcases out of the same material, so they appear to be 2 different colors. I thought I was getting a good deal because they were discounted so much, but after seeing them, there's no way the actual retail price of these is $62.00. I've seen better at Wal-Mart for a small fraction of that. I can't believe Amazon still has these for sale!"
2,Don't Fit,Very comfortable but I had trouble getting them on my full size bed. They were definitely too small.
2,"Nice feel, but square cut, not fitted for a queen bed","I bought these sheets and washed/dryed them. The did not fit the bed at all. The are cut for a square shape bed I guess, because they did not fit our bed. Maybe the are irregular or something? Not quite sure. I will check the measurements again and double check. Be careful before buying."
1,Terrible Quality,"Save your money. I wish I would have read the reviews on this sheet set before ordering. I ordered the full set, washed them in cold water and dried them on low heat as listed on the instructions and they shrunk. If this is the quality of merchandise that Amazon is going to be selling I think I've just placed my last order with them. The quality of these sheets is absolutely the worst and I can't imagine anyone paying full price for them. I'll have to use them on a twin size bed - can't use them on the full size bed."
1,not worth the bargain price,Horrible sheets- poor material and they do not fit the size mattress called for.
1,Sheet Set Didn't Fit!,The Royal Heritage 100% Cotton Jersey Knit Sheets were supposed to fit a King-Size bed. Maybe they were queen-size at best. Returned!
1,Do Not Buy!,These sheets are the worst! They are square! Don't fit the bed and are very thin! Don't waste your money! I put mine in the rag box after 1 use!
1,misfit,"sheets did not fit bed properly, pillowcase seams where crooked and came across middle of pillow. not at all impressed with the quality or workmanship."
2,Very disappointing,"They were comfy for about two days, then they got the little beads that cheap t-shirts get after a few washes -- and I only washed the sheets once! I guess you get what you pay for."
1,Waste of money,"I washed these sheets before putting them on my bed and the fitted sheet won't cover my mattress at all. The top sheet is too small, and the pillowcases shrunk into odd shapes after washing. The fabric is very thin and almost see-through.Disappointing purchase and waste of money."
1,what a waste of my money,"they are awful, they are cut & stretches in such a way that already they do not fit well on the mattress, so every time you move the corners get loose & the fitted sheet rolls under your body, quality of the jersey is very poor, it's like sleeping with a tee shirt that was washed thousand of times, the only good thing I pay only $20 & I shld be paid to have bought thoses sheets.never ever again, as far as I am concern it gives Amazon a bad reputation"
1,Hard to believe it's cotton,"First, the set of sheets we ordered had the wrong sized bottom sheet in the package. Second, it didn't feel like cotton, even after washing. It felt like poly. I am returning this set of jersey sheets. I wouldn't want to keep them, even if the bottom sheet fit the bed."
1,smells,I bought a Royal Heritage 100% cotton flannel blanket and IT SMELLS. I have washed it and it still smells. Is there a way to contact Royal Heritage directly to find out how to fix this???ChrisieAry@aol.com
1,the worst possible purchase,"I know, I should have gone by the reviews I read, but I didn't, and stupidly bought these sheets. They were by far the worst sheets I've ever had. Totally did not even come close to fitting the bed, and the pillowcases were sown unevenly as well. DO NOT BUY THESE!"
2,looks are decieving,One of the best looking kettles on the market. That's what you're paying for. Functionality is lacking. The rubber seal on the lid was broken after two weeks and the whistle doesn't work anymore because of this or perhaps whistle is just broken. So dissapointed.
2,Not the best,"Although I loved the kettle's appearance and used it a lot, I had to discard it beacuse the inside eventually rusted. I opted to replace it with stainless steel---much better."
1,Enamel Flaking Off After Four Months,"I use my kettle everyday for tea and loved it until the enamel started flaking off - slowly as first and then more with every passing day. Chantal was absolutely no help - essentially accusing me of letting the kettle boil dry (which I didn't) and offering me the option to purchase a new kettle. They DID NOT honor the warranty against defects and I'm utterly disgusted with this company. All Clad, here I come."
4,very funky,"just the songs just another sucker, games(original version) and games are enough for me....the intro to just another sucker caught my interest cause it sounded like something that would have been straight from Sonic the Hedgehog 2...its just proof that he was ahead of his time"
5,Best information out there,"Heard about this book and after reading it, now understand how great barefoot is! Lots of information and photos, step-by-step instructions, help make it easy to begin. Will be my ""bible"" from now on for worry free barefoot care."
4,Barefoot Trimming,Great book. Great concept. A must for 'natural' horse care people. Would like to see more specific how-to in a chart or chapter.
3,As time goes by...,... and music changes so did ZZ Top. This is not anymore the very blues they were famous for. I don't want every one of their CDs to be like this one.But anyway it's a CD that's just fun listening to.
4,ZZ Top Afterburner,"Very Good. Good price, and product arrived in excellent condition.Very good ZZ Top clstyle of music. Would recommend to all ZZ Top fans."
2,Mediocre,"Except for the outstanding track, ""On the Other Hand,"" this album failed to capture me. Check out Old 8 x 10 instead"
2,The book si good at best,"The book has an inscription dated in 1996!So the book has been around a long time.It appears to be well read, paper looks its age.With, 10 new books from $6.65,I made a mistake buying this well read used book!Some times sucha deal is not a deal at all!"
4,"A bit confusing, but nice","At FIRST, I did'nt GET the item,(a mail mix-up, i'm guessing) however, EFORCITY straightened it out, and I have it now. (I'de suggest using USPS over DHL, however) ANYWAY, I just got the cable yesterday, and since i'm FAR from good at ALMOST anything of a technical nature, I read other reviews to find out what i'll need, and it seems i'll need something called ""BitPim"" (whatever THAT is)and while i've read I CAN'T, i'm going to TRY to get my pics off my phone. (I HOPE) All in all though, the cable looked (and fit) GREAT! I think I can do more with it, than I first thought! CERTAINLY worth it!"
4,Love it,Beautiful pictures accompany some childrens poetry about their bodies. Great book to read as a model for your class.
2,For gift shop enthusiasts only,"""Hand in hand"" is an album released during the 1988 Olympic Summer Games in Seoul, South Korea. The title song became an international success, and may be the only Korean song ever to become a number one hit in Sweden.The band Koreana must be the ultimate one hit wonder!The song isn't particularly good, and the rest of the album is even weaker. Why would anyone want to buy this album? It's probably for gift shop enthusiasts only. But yes, the 1988 summer games were memorable for other reasons.Ben Johnson and Carl Lewis, anyone?"
3,Grisly Thriller with only a Passing Acquaintance with Poe,"Viewers expecting this film to be an adaptation of Poe's immortal ""Tell-Tale Heart"" might well be disappointed. This is a reimagining of the tale in which a hardworking father has a new lease of life, having recovered from a heart transplant, and by chance meets a beautiful woman. However things start to go wrong when he is haunted by his own heartbeat, and understands that he must find out the shady past of the donor who gave him his new heart. Produced by the Scott brothers, this is a fascinating study of psychological disturbance, if a little grisly for squeamish viewers."
3,it wasnt that good and it wasnt that bad,"The zombies in this where kinda pathetic, well when they were in small numbers. Word of advice, watch this movie with subtitles because it takes place in ireland and some of the dialogue is kinda hard to understand, I think I gave this movie Three Stars because of the ending. A horde of zombies attack and the three survivors have no guns, just a shovel, some type of club and a torch. Its the not the best horde attack scene but it was the best part of the movie. I would recommend this but just make sure you find a cheap used one."
3,Pleasant Surprise,"I really was expecting rubbish. How many utterly dull horror films have we endured? Yes, like me, you have sat through some shockers. Brrrrrrrrr. Here was another with a lousy cover, but I was forced to try it (like all the others - why do we do it to ourselves?) in the hope of a pleasant surprise. A miracle, the film is Irish, and quite okay. Nice mad cow. Nice zombie action. Entertaining and worth the trouble. Not likely to be a classic . . . but perfectly watchable."
3,Dead Meat is a watchable zombie film. Countryside Zombies!!,"Okay, if you've seen ""Let Sleeping Corpses Lie"", there are similarities: country setting with zombies, survival of a woman and those she meets.Mad Cow disease takes a rare form, turning people into zombies. Only about six survivors in a countryside of about seventy zombies, scattered about. The gore is decent, the directing has a documentary feel, the acting works. Not much story other than run, but it's not bad, filled with plenty of daylight and night scenes, Dead Meat is a good, watchable zombie film, though LSCL is still a better film. Plenty of slow moving zombies and passable make up give it a point. The country atmosphere really helps keep this unique."
2,"Cows eat people, yup","I can't be as critical as some in regard to this movie; I mean for pete's sake, the budget is probably as much as J Lo demands for girdles in her average flick. The film is pretty well done in regards to filming if you consider it to be in documentary style ala ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" or ""The Evil Dead"". Some nice touches that add to the movie are some facts few knew:If zombies are eating they don't chase you.Zombies created by cow bites sleep like cows--standing up.The actor portraying the high school coach is pretty much of a hoot, and I thought he was one of the best characters.The ending was ok, with two suited individuals (The IRA?) who kill loads of zombies and load up people onto what appears to be a cattle truck. Do I sense that the director is really a vegetarian? hmmmA nice extra that you can view is a short movie called ""the braineater"" about a bratty kid who causes the death of his family and after resorting to eating his fathers brain, kinda likes it, lol."
3,Flesh eaters....,"Nice Special effects, most GoreZone flicks seem to get badly edited on..Another thing never seen a Zombie movie filmed in Ireland.Could've had a little better plot to it but o-well, its a Zombie flick how much of a plot can there be..."
1,not very good...,"People say this is a B movie, when its actually more of a C or even a Z movie. The zombies look lame, the ""special"" effects arent that special, and the story is really bad. Plus when I saw a zombie COW and people walking right past standing sleeping zombies I about turned the damn thing off but I paid like 3 bucks to rent it so I forced myself to sit through it, good thing it was only a hour long.This isn't like a bad movie where you can make fun of it as you watch it...it's just bad.If you really want to buy it I suggest renting it first...it might change your mind."
4,Quite Good Third Album,"I am a huge fan of catchy, rock'n roll with insightful lyrics. Musicforthemorningafter is an outstanding album in this style. Unfortunately, its follow-up sounded good, but I did not find it quite as melodic. Pete Yorn's third album is definitely an improvement over his second. It is not as consistent as his first, but worth the purchase if you loved his first album and were somewhat disappointed by his second album. If you enjoy Pete Yorn then I strongly recommend that you check out the following:1) Banjos and Sunshine by Sixty Acres2) Parade of Small Horses by C. Gibbs3) Home by Josh Rouse"
3,Crawleringers,"There are some good songs on this album. I think undercover is probably the gem on here. If you like his earlier stuff, then this should be at least somewhat enjoyable. Problem is that these songs dont carry the whole record for me. I first heard bandstand in the sky on his live album. The version on here is not so great. I just hope he doesnt experiment to the point of changing what everyone knows him for. Good songwriting/rocker. If you have never been exposed to Pete-e (as me and the boys call him) go for Musicforthemorningafter. It is still amazing to this day. As for Nightcrawler, it gets better with a few listens."
5,"Great symphony, truncated fill-up","As the other reviewer said, you buy this CD for the symphony - because the suite from ""Hamlet"" is missing its first movement, and no explanation for this is given in the brief notes accompanying the recording. The suite is mislabeled in the notes, too, as the composer's Op. 116, when Shostakovich gave that number to the complete film score, and the suite is logged as Op. 116a. But let's get back to the main event: Previn and the LSO offer an alternately gutsy and yearning account of the symphony, cutting loose when required in the kind of raucous way that Shostakovich often needs, and the sound quality is outstanding considering its provenance."
5,No Toilet Paper,This is one of the funniest books I have ever read. Could hardly keep my eyes open to continue reading! Hilarious!!
4,Not quite like the original,"We bought this skillet to replace one we've had for several years and while it's similar it has been ""cheapened"" up somewhat, not as wide a lip around the edge, smaller pour spouts and a less attractive, lighter handle. Of course, more expensive, too. Still it seems about the same weight. Hope it holds up as well as the original."
4,Buy this CD and become tragically hip,"Way back before I want to admit, a college roommate introduced me to this group. While I never found another album from The Replacements anywhere near to Tim, I became a huge fan of the style of music and lyrics. Waitress in The Sky is as witty as memorable. Kiss Me On The Bus is great. Everyone should have a few albums that bring back good memories. I do, and this is pretty close to the top of that list."
4,"Songs are best ever, but what's with the production?","The greatest collection of songs the 'Mats ever put together (which is saying a lot). ""Swinging Party"", ""Left of the Dial"", ""Bastards of Young"" etc. are mostly incredible. Even the filler is pretty good. But the massive overdubbing of fuzzy guitars obliterates the band's most prescious asset: it's loveable, rock-n-roll spirited personality. Chris Mars' drums and Tommy's bass are buried so far into the mix that I can hardly hear them, and Paul's lyrics are often indecipherable. Bob is definitely missed on this album. The best moments are when they tone it down (""Swinging Party"" ""Here Comes a Regular"") and overcome the limitations of the production."
4,"Part II of the ""Trilogy""","Same year I saw Springsteen's Born in the USA tour, I caught these guys in an SF club, and witnessed the Greatest Band In The World. I've always considered Tim to be Pt. II of a series of an incredible triple (you guys know the other two albums...). Other than the obvious comments I can go on about the extremely high quality of the songs, I have to give Tim a 4 star rating because Tommy Ramone's (yes, THAT Tommy) production was so one-dimensional; he actually mixed this album using HEADPHONES because he was almost deaf from playing drums with the Ramones. But it's par for the course; leave it to the Replacements to hire a near-deaf producer. Seriously, along with Elvis Costello's first three, The Beatles catalog, Big Star's albums, and the Rolling Stones' Mick Taylor period, the ' Mat's three middle releases are some of rock's most listenable and important albums in rock's recent history..."
3,Brighter than the picture,"When we received the slip cover, the first thing we noticed was although it looks rust-colored in the picture, it's actually WAAAAY bright orange. Luckily I like orange. Otherwise, it's a great product, we're very happy."
3,very good but not perfect,"I really wanted to give this book 5 stars but after I thought about it I realized that it wouldn't be right. This book is inspirational and it's beautifully dramatic. However, there are some things wrong with it. For instance, I think it had way too much unneccesary descriptions that made it hard to follow the actual story. Whenever I got to a long and boring description, I put the book down for a week and then made myself struggle through it. Maybe if I were a little older it would've been easier to read. Also, I think the characters were quite unrealistic and unlikable. And there were no important female chatacters either. The action is good though, and I really enjoyed this book."
5,The Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Rings,"Fantastic adventure! From Hobbiton and the black riders, to Strider and Rivendale, to the fellowship and the wizard, Gandalf, a delight!"
3,"Obnoxious s.o.b. hero, slow heroine.","Rafe Danvers had disliked Shaan Saketa from the first moment he met her, on the arm of Piers Dancers, his brother. When Piers jults Shaan hours before their wedding, Rafe takes over, bullying a shocked Shaan into marriage to him. As the shock wears off, Shaan begins to feel love for Rafe. Then she overhears a damning phone conversation that implies that Rafe is in love with his brother's new wife and that he has been stuck with the ""leftovers"".A bit over the top as Rafe takes ruthless advantage of Shaan's shock to get his own way. Shaan lacks maturity and Rafe is obsessive. The book harks back to the early days of Harlequin Presents when the heroes could and did do whatever they wanted in the name of love, the heroine's feelings bedamned."
3,Buy the Rhino reissues instead!,"I'm 38 years old, and I've been a die-hard Ramones fan since 1979. I bought this album when it first came out, and, of course I loved it back then. But, the older I get, the more I realize that the TRUE Ramones sound was defined on the first 8 albums, all of which have been re-released by Rhino with bonus tracks and demos on each cd. The cds also have great liner notes about what was going on woth the band during the time they recorded the album.Animal Boy has it's moments, as in Apeman Hop, Animal Boy, and Love Kills. BUT, this album also had the weak stuff like ""Something To Believe In"" and ""Crummy Stuff"".If you are an old time fan, then you might want this just so you can say ""Hey, I got all the Ramones albums"", but if you are just starting out, get Too Tough To Die and then all of the other re-issues.Thanks."
2,Great but Fragile,"I owned this device and loved it for the 6-12 months that it worked. I probably used it 2-3 times a month and kept it safe in my laptop bag when not in use.But one day it stopped working. Upon inspection, the connector from one of the USB ends came loose with the wire. Now it's useless. :("
1,Boycotted?,"The orchestral sound for this recording is so blurred and atrocious, I cannot understand what the ""producers"" were thinking. Does Opera d'Oro 'cheapens' it on purpose? How can the original source be so bad? And if so, why release it, then? Not for more than a buck, sorry. Because yes; Nilsson is interesting to hear and Fricasy was a great one, but the orchestral colors of this beautiful score need decent sound; and this is in-decent."
5,What does my Aunt do?,"As a cartographer and GIS student I am forever being asked ""But what do you DO?"". Now that I have nieces and nephews on the way I will be getting a copy of this for each one that comes along so they all can learn about what ""Aunteesa"" does at work! Love this book--was introduced to it in one of my GIS classes by the instructor who actually includes it in lectures! Amazingly accurate portrait of cartography in a kid's book....love it."
2,Disapointing,"The sound varies quite a bit on this CD but the macho posturing does not. All the themes are the same and with nothing to say, it's just tiresome, the ATL are baaaad blah blah blah. Stick to LIVING LIKE HUSTLERS."
5,night lite,I gave this as an exchange gift. The person that received it called as soon as she got home; telling me how beautiful it looked in her bathroom. It just gives that extra touch you need in a room.
2,"Good book, poor shipping service","The book is very good. I had a copy before and wore it out, and ordered a new one to replace it. It was shipped by ""green sea"" in Florida and postage was 43 cents short. My husband had to drive to the post office (9 miles round trip) to pay the postage and pick it up. I don't care about the 43 cents, but a lot of time was wasted having to go get it."
3,MISLEADING,The photos BOTh show the valance. Therefore I expected to receive it as well. It even is shown on the close-up photo. Not cool. Now I have to find the valence by itself. Thanks...
2,Not so pretty now . . .,"I owned the white version of this kettle for a good 10 years when things started flaking off the inside. It was probably just build-up that I could have boiled away with water and vinegar, but I didn't investigate too closely because I'd been eying this copper beauty. After less than two years, it looks more like an old crone. You have to polish it for it to look decent, but, since it's copper plate, polishing seems to be taking off the copper. I can now see silver underneath..As for function, it heats up quickly, the whistle works, and it's a great size. However, as several reviewers have pointed out, the handle is too hot to touch without an oven mitt after you've boiled water. And I want a bit more than function. I use a kettle several times a day, and it never leaves my stovetop except to be cleaned. So I also want something that looks nice. This ain't it.I like these kettles, despite the too-high price, which may keep me from buying another."
1,"Nice Story, Terrible Grammar","If you believe that books are a great way for your children to learn good English grammar, then this book is not for you. The author fails to use the subjunctive and writes, ""I wish I was"" instead of the correct, ""I wish I were"", several times in the story. Shame on the author and the publisher for dumbing down the English. Just because this is accepted in popular culture is no excuse for writing in such a way. It is disappointing because the story is lovely."
3,Cobra's quality seems lacking,"First unit shipped to me received fine but the transmit audio was terrible. Even with the Dynamike turned up all the way people could barely hear me. Had to literally shout to be heard at all.To Amazon's credit they sent me a replacement unit 2nd day air. Amazon has been great to deal with, as always.This second radio seems to transmit fine so far. However, the speaker of this radio emits a constant, low volume, high pitched whine when receiving. The first radio did not have this ""feature"".The good news is all of the controls and features seem to work correctly and the noise blanker and automatic noise limiter do a terrific job stopping car ignition noises. I figure I will keep this radio and live with the whine and hope no other problems crop up. If they do I will change my rating."
4,Quality Citizens Band Radio after Frequency Alignment,"Bought this radio for sideband use primarily. Be aware all modern day sideband radios will be off frequency from the factory. They will work fine on AM but will have to be aligned by a tech for sideband operation. This will run about $25. The real test of a quality sideband radio is whether or not it is stable and free of drift. I am happy to report that the new Chinese made Cobra 148 GTL is stable once it has been aligned. They are now made to Cobra's specs by Ranger Communications I am told. Wish they would be on frequency for sideband right out of the box, but like I said before it is not unusual to have an alignment performed for good sideband use on present day radios. At least it doesn't drift off frequency like the Galaxy radios."
4,Looks Can Be Deceiving!,"I ordered this accidentally (I was in a hurry and thought it was an electric throw while looking for a larger sized throw). Anyway when I got it I was not happy b/c I ordered the wrong item, and honestly it looked flimsy - if I saw it in a store I would keep walking towards something nicer and puffier... BUT then I decided to try it out. It's wonderfully warm, although it is rather thin, and doen't look like it would keep anything warm. The size is PERFECT (I'm 5'4"", but it's just the right size for lounging on the sofa/chair. It keeps me nice and warm w/o the bulk, too. I recommend trying this throw, as looks can be deceiving! One more note: just because it doesn't have more down in it (as opposed to polyester) doesn't mean it's NOT warm! You forget how warm synthetics are when you're used to down items."
3,Nice but not for tall people,"I thought this would be longer than it is. I'm 6'3 and on the couch it barely reaches the top of my chest once I fold it under my feet a bit. Good material though, would keep someone under 6' nice and toasty."
5,BEST CHRISTMAS PRESENT EVER!!!!,"I bought 30 of the beige throws for our chistmas persents to everybody, and i sent them embroired the initial of every person. They were thrilled, everybody call back to say it was the brest present ever!! it matches with everyones studio, conforter of tv room!! I dont know what im going to do to beat this gift the next year!!"
5,Just got the Al Adamson book and its great!!,"Just got the Al Adamson book and its great!! Its a drag that he died the way he did, but great that he's getting so much attention. I find his films facinating--real personality.There's a foto on page 57-- I just wanted to point ou that its from THE BLOOD SEEKERS (Drac Vs Frank), Gary Graver is behind tha camera and in the far left is Denver Dixon!!!How can I write to David Konow? A website is listed in the bookThanks---James B, recovering IIP fan."
4,"Informative, Captivating Non-Fiction Read","I live in Seattle which might be one reason I was attracted to this book as it sat on the shelf at Marlene's Market in Federal Way and I am happy to report it did not dissapoint. I am happy to have insight into the heavy metal waste industry and how the regulations (or lack of) affect us not only through the choices of uninformed--or in some cases, greedy--farmer's made re: the food we eventually eat - but also in the household consumer products markets such as with de-icers and small plant food. I am very curious what has transpired since 2001 and will be searching the net for whatever updates on the topics I can find! Go Patty Martin! Asking questions should never be discouraged. I understand the fear of people causing unecessary scare's but.. when you are discouraged in round one of questioning, generally it means you are on the right track in wondering why certain answers aren't being given."
2,"Great idea, poorly manufactured","I wanted to teach my daughter the basics of weaving before we moved on in level of difficulty, so when I came across this item I remembered my early days and thought it would be ideal to teach the principles of weaving to her with.The loops it comes with are made out of a rather frighting synthetic fabric, and appear to be cuttings from a failed tights factory. The petroleum used to manufacture them could have been better used to manufacture Gasoline.The hook broke in the middle of use on the first project. Flimsy as all get out, it's now being glued back together and the seam reinforced with tape.The idea is a phenomenal one - its a time tested learning toy, but this one fails due to poor manufacturing. I would suggest spending the money on something better made. I know I will be doing so and very soon.For Concept and what it can teach - I give it 4 stars.For manufacture - well giving it any star is really being generous."
3,Where Are the Numerals?,"To receive regular numbers and not the featured Roman Numerals is not correct and there's no justification. Never wanted the hassle it is for me to returned the clock, [DISABLED] however, Gloryland should be called on the carpet and be carefully watched for switching."
5,Great Product Overall,"I spent time researching various Camera bags. It is hard to know which one will be right for you but the most important things for me was design (will it work for my purpose), durability and price. Overall I would say I am very happy with this bag. I debated on the medium or large option but eventually went with the large bag just because I know I will add more stuff as I go along.The large back is perfect for my needs (Canon t3i and two lenses). It is a well made bag - seems like it will last. As mentioned before the strap is not the best but will do for now. I do like the inside being yellow as others have mentioned also.I would recommend this camera bag to others."
4,Everything I expected,"Should I save a few dollars and buy the medium case, or should I go for the large? Decided on the large and am very happy with the choice. I am able to carry my DSLR with 300mm lens and sun hood attached with easy accessibility. Beneath this, there is plenty of space for additional lenses, batteries, etc. The front pocket works well for my filter collection.The non slip shoulder strap works well and I have never felt in danger of losing it.The exterior seems tough, but only time will tell there. Zips and fittings all seem robust and should be good for the long haul. Padding is dense and well located and I expect it to do the job fine if I ever have the misfortune to drop the bag.All in all, very pleased with the purchase and look forward to many years of solid service."
5,Good case study on difficulties of teaching poor city kids,"The book ""36 Children"" is intersting to compare to Jonathan Kozol's more famous book ""Death at an early age"", written at about the same time, in the 1960s. I would say that Kozol had a better experience than Kohl, and he was a better teacher. But Kohl's book is valuable because it is brutally honest about the selfish motivations of the average teacher, as well as the difficulties, stereotypes and misunderstandings that get in the way of good teaching.Another difference between Kohl and Kozol is that Kozol had one class of children to teach, while Kohl was teaching children who were 1 or 2 years older and split into separate classes. It makes me wonder if it is easier to teach kids in a single class rather then divide them up into periods so that the teachers keep changing.Other books to recommend in this genre are ""Savage Inequalities"" by Jonathan Kozol, ""Children of crisis"" by Robert Coles, and ""Ghetto schooling"" by Jean Anyon."
4,great grunge,"A different take on grunge than maybe, (if you even know what grunge is), you're accustomed to. I like it."
1,didn't work,"Because the fans in the unit were in the way, this actually REDUCED the airflow. The fan flow couldn't make up for the cross sectional area that they impeded."
5,This CD is so underrated,"This is my 3rd favorite Aerosmith CD, right behind Rocks & Toys, I don't understand you people say that ""weak"" or ""it was a mistake""Want to hear WEAK, anything these sell outs have put out in the last 10 years!!btw for some of you people's information, Joe Perry and Mr Whitford didnt even play on Wings, the 2 Alice Cooper gtr players did the tracks"
3,"Not Great, But Not Bad","While Done With Mirrors is one of my least favorite Aerosmith albums, it's not a bad album. ""Let The Music Do The Talking,"" ""The Reason A Dog,"" and ""My Fist Your Face"" are great songs. But tracks like ""Shela"" and ""She's On Fire"" are a little on the weak side. Plus, the production on this album was horrible. It also lacks the energy of albums like Rocks or Pump."
2,The Harsh Truth,"This is Aerosmith's worst album. Thankfully, it's still listenable. There's simply not any high points. If you to hear ""let the music do the talking"" you're better off getting the Joe Perry Project version. After this album, the group cleaned up their act and starting making good albums again. All this album is the group trying desperately to capture the brilliance of their '70s masterpieces. They still have their signature sound but the songs just don't cut it."
3,Worst Hits,I think this is there worst cd ever here are some other bad ones. Forth Worst-4.Rock in Hard Place 82' Third-3.Draw the LIne 78' Second-2.Big Ones 94' Worst-1.Done With Mirrors 85'
2,What can I say?,"This is the album that they all put together, after being apart. It's certainly not their best. I dare say it is the worst - HOWEVER - there is NO bad Aerosmith song - just some that are not as good. There are some good ones on there, and if you are a true AeroFan, you MUST add this to your collection. I haven't listened to it as much as my others, but I must admit it is not as bad as everyone says. And the fact that they had just gotten back together and beaten the odds, and were on their way back to the top ALONE should convince you to get this. And it's cheaper than the others, too. So go for it! It could end up being your favorite!"
3,most average of their efforts.,aerosmith is a great band; but this is their most average by far. Still it's not worse than a average rock cd of the era. But compared even to 'rock in a hard place' this to me just seemed a little flat for this band. but a flatter aerosmith cd is way above alot of lesser bands efforts for sure.
1,For Lewis collectors only!,"The central problem I have with these four little volumes, although I must confess to having only seen (and bought) one, rests in the fact they are very short, they do injustice to Lewis's thoughts on the subjects simply because the selection is not wide enough, and, especially on Grief, A GRIEF OBESERVED works so much better as a healing and theraputic book than this little tome ever could. If you're going to get into C. S. Lewis's thought, even if only a sampler, get something like THE BUSINESS OF HEAVEN or THE ESSENTIAL C. S. LEWIS or THE QUOTABLE LEWIS? Items like these characterize the industy that has grown up around C. S. Lewis: all sorts of merchandise is being published cashing in on Lewis and his life -- with Hooper largely at the back of it. If you want a novelty item (which is all this will ever be) or just a little gift I guess you could buy these, but why not spend a little more and buy a real C. S. Lewis book? They're so much richer!Mike London"
4,I think he should have titled it ::,"'Icicles In My Meat Loaf' after the same name as the song, he would have sold more copies maybe, that song title alone is worth the price of admission, so funny and the song itself ain't half bad, I heard it on Bluesville on XM radio and that's what attracted me to it here, I have one of his other CD's but I don't think that one's as good as this one. And after all it's just my opinion. That's why I only gave it 4 stars.[...]"
2,Wonder Why Students Are Flunking Science Courses?,"This book was cited in the Orlando Sentinel 11/20/05 for numerous errors in an article about textbook errors.Examples:*""stopping distance of a car is directly related to its momentum"" (should be kinetic enery, not momentum)*""the role of gravity in the atom is not clearly understood"" (gravity plays no appreciable role in the atom)*""the most advanced memory chip can store as much information as 1 million vacuum tubes can"" (true in 1985, but far out of date now)Other errors were cited as well. The Sentinel quoted George Nelson of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, saying ""It's a credit to science teachers that their students are learning anything at all."""
4,Captain America - Marvel Legends,Las colecciones de Marvel Legends son muy buenas y esta figura de accion es una de las que un fan de Marvel Comics debe tener.
4,All about redemption.,"A decent ""purgatorial"" novel about the redemption of a soul and what it takes. I often found myself thinking of Lewis's space trilogy during the read especially the last volume. I'd put this on a reading list of books about the theology of purgation; The Divine Comedy, The Great Divorce, etc.At times I found Williams writing style a bit thick but I suspect that was intentional. I particularly enjoyed what seemed to be a slam on logical positivism and literary post-modernism in the character of the clerk.Some classify this as horror and perhaps it is but it wasn't really scary to me. In fact, the clerk just winds up looking like a boob. Maybe the scariest thing about it is the choice one of the characters makes for hell."
2,Card's not half bad but support is awful,"I happen to live in an area with strong HDTV over-the-air signals and HDTV WONDER works quite well BUT Channel 2, for whatever reason, fails to display video even though the signal strength indicator is very strong. So I called ATI support which offers no toll free number and is located in Canada, they gave me the usual BS and a reference number BUT NO HELP. Said they'd get back to me. They didn't. Wrote them an email, got a canned response that showed no one actually read my problem discription.IN SHORT THE CARD AIN'T AWFUL BUT THE SUPPORT IS."
3,50/50,"I have a strong signal, pretty much unobstructed. It pulled in the stations OK. Be sure to use the download software on the site, not that on the disc, though.What about the other 50? With Windows Media Center Edition 2005, it piggybacks on the analog tuner card you already have in order to pick up those channels. This means that when you want to switch back and forth - everytime you want the analog channels, you will have to re-tune your MCE (downloading a new 2-week program guide each time!) - and when you want to look at the HD channels, you'll have to go back into MCE and tune the analog channels OUT!As far as I know this unit has not been nominated for any design prizes. Hmmm."
1,Out of data technology,Do not get this if you have media center. It does not work well with Media Center and the standard definition tuner will not work at all with Media Center. That's important becuase Media Center's TV features will not work with out a standard defination tuner. In other words you can not use it with only an HD tuner.I don't know why ATI has not released an updated card that is designed to work with Media Center. I guess they are milking this one for all it is worth.I got the AVER 180 becuase it is designed for Media Center and it works well. I gave this card to a freind who does not use Media Center. He says is works as a standard tuner but he does not get HDTV.
1,Good luck finding the signals,"So far I've been much less than pleased with the HDTV Wonder. Before purchasing this I made sure to check what stations I would be able to pick up in my areas. I lived in Atlanta, GA and CheckHD said that CBS, NBC, TBS, FOX, WB, ABC, REL, TBN, PAX, UPN, Univision, and 2 PBS stations would be receivable via DTV. No problem. So I installed my card and setup my antenna (I made sure to meet the DirectX, processor and video board requirements), and all I can receive consistantly is PAX?! TBS is JUST BARELY coming in, and the signal is never peaking 20%. Ridiculous. I recently relocated to Savannah where I'm supposed to be able to pick up NBC, CBS and FOX over the HD signal, and now I can pick up none. What's the point of buying this product if you won't be able to use it?"
2,too much poetry,"Anyone who wants to read about the war in Rhodesia should stay away from this poetic diatribe. No offence to Dan but he should have jumped ship and gone to England while the REAL war was going down, because this is so befuddled that it could have been written during the Victorian Era with liberal doses of opiates involved. If you want the low down on the Rhodesian war then read Chris Cocks's excellent account ""Fireforce"" or Charlie Warrens ""At the going down of the sun"". The reading of this book is painfull at best and would probably best be used as a very thick drinks coaster, probably after page 3 by most people interested in the subject! Sorry Dan but stick to peotry!"
2,boring,"if you liked Cocks' book, you would do better to reread it than buy this one, which starts slow and finishes slow after a long slow middle. The book shows how boring soldiering can be."
5,"Traumatic but, worth it","It's always great to see a lot of favorite conductors. Of course, one wants to hear and see great performances but, considering the circumstances, shoddiness and approximation would alleviate some dischord caused by the working of these musical geniuses within the Third Reich. This DVD serves to continue to prove just how dangerous art can be. Maybe we, as modern Americans, are lucky to have no such threat either in the score or on the podium. Buy this and wonder how this all could have come to pass."
1,absolute rubbish,For the money I expected a good story which was implied. Not this!!! Better luck next time. Regards
5,Great scent at a great price,"This is a hard to find scent, but is very classic and not overwhelming at all. Will continue to reorder."
5,Catalyst,It took me forever to find the name of this spray from this sample that some one gaved me and good thing the sample looked exactly like the realy thing haha love it and its cheaper to buy here than in stores.
5,Happiness does come in bottles,"I have a difficult time finding this fragrance & I was really happy to have found it on Amazon. I have used this product for years & look forward to many more. Women love this fragrance, very subtle, not musky."
4,Old school R&B,I heard Superwoman on the radio and a flood of old memories can. SO I went to my box of tapes and put in Karyn White. ThenI put in the other tape. Karyn was the girl in her dad and I did a lot of dancing and romancing to her.
4,Karyn WHite at her best,"I love this CD, its one of the best that Karyn made during her short career, sorry I have not heard more"
3,What A Disappointment,"I WAS EXPECTING TO SEE DESIREE COUSTEAU IN ALL HER GLORY, only to be deceived and disappointed that SHE wasn't in the movie at all! All I can say is BUYER BEWARE!"
2,A pain,"Difficult to see, which in my book makes it pretty useless. I wear contacts and remove them at night. During the night I cannot see the clock which is only a foot from my head, due to the color/lighting of the face. I've never had this problem before. It is easier for me to read my husband's clock which is placed across the room. The atomic clock feature is nice, but otherwise not worth it."
1,Had to return it,"This clock has all the features I was looking for in a new bedside clock radio. It is simple to set up. However, the screen is an amber color, and the digital numbers are so faint that I could barely see them. There was no way to adjust the brightness of the screen, so it was worthless for me and I returned it."
4,Good Atomic Clock,It works fine and the atomic clock sync's up fine for me. The setup is a little complicated. You better keep the manual around. The snooze setting is only 5 minutes which I believed that I would hate but it is ok. The biggest issue is the display. The orange color and the lite black display is hard to see. You have to look straight at the display or you can not see the display. The other minor issue is when you hit the snooze button then the display goes dark. I hit the snooze then I like to look at the time. I now have to look at the clock and hit the snooze after. The second method makes the most sense but I want the alarm to stop ASAP.
4,Great Little Radio,"Bought this to replace the Sony Dream Machine I had for years. Wanted something that got better reception and this one seems to fill the bill. The atomic clock picked up the signal right away in the location I wanted so I was thrilled. The FM reception is great and most AM stations. The manual is a little confusing at first but the pictures help. Being able to set the alarm for specific days is great and the HWS alarm is much better than one jolting sound. The screen is hard to read at night since the backlight is so bright but darkening it does not seen to help. Oh well, you are supposed to be sleeping anyway. Right?"
2,I'm using it just because I don't wanna feel it was a waste of time and money,"but I really see no point of this one. It doesn't look good, the wire is too wide and door barely closes. It only holds one single place and not really a heavy one."
3,Too shallow,"I have three Corelle platters I was hoping to put here...thinking that because they are thin they wouldn't take up more room than a traditional heavy platter would. Actually, only one platter fits (two, if I turn them upside down, but that's too unstable). There's only an inch and a half of usable space, so measure carefully before your order. Otherwise, I like the design."
3,Same as other reviews,This is indeed an ingenious idea. Portion in the back needs to be a tad deeper to hold the platter. It will only hold one platter (well almost - when I jam it in). The increase of depth at the back would allow two platters to be in the same space. Just sayin'.
5,Romantic modern Italian music with great horns,"Heard the title song in a cab in Florence in 2003, and I was able to identify the CD in a listening section of a music store. The music has a very beatiful, full, rich sound. Very romantic and evocative. Highly recommended."
3,so-so,"I read this book after having read Four Corners of Night and the River Sorrow (the author's other books). The other two books are superior. The Last Sanctuary is predictable and implausible, but an OK beach read."
3,"A good read, but lacking after River Sorrow","Holden has a great grasp on the tragic American hero and is also able to spin highly-infectious stories. The resultant combo is best displayed in The River Sorrow. While this book starts strong and has a vice-like hold on the reader through the middle sections, I found the last section to be predictable, and even a bit corny. I was downright disappointed with Holden on this latest offering, but as I hold him to an exceptionally high standard, I still must give the book a decent review. A great one to bring to the beach; make sure you apply enough suntan lotion before starting the book as you'll have a hard time putting it down for much of the story"
1,I thought I was going crazy,I had the same problem with my Toshiba DVD player. It is simply not possible to turn off the hearing impaired captions. UGH. I have been waiting to see this movie and now I need to put up with these captions all over the screen. Thumbs down Universal!
2,overlong music video...,"This film is so full of unnecessary camera shakes, pans, dollies and zooms that after a while it all becomes a rather pointless eye exercise. Also the fast paced music never stops for an instant, which seems to be the copyright of so many bad action-thriller movies cropping up recently . If it was a 5 min. music video this I could endure, but at 2 hours it made me want to puke. Also I tried not to fall asleep watching more than half an hour of pointless and boring close up shots of ugly blokes in a darkened meeting room staring and squinting at each other, at documents etc. The totally unlovable character of Robert Redford made it impossible for me to identify with him, while Brad Pitt was same as always, not bad, not outstanding."
4,A Thinking Man's Movie,"What a great mind twisting movie. While Robert Redford and Brad Pitt's characters run the gamut of teacher-student to friends to former friends they still understand what each other is all about. As the movie moves into its final stages and the cloak and dagger picks up it becomes even more engrossing. This is a move, somewhat, in the vein of ""Sneaker"" with the little, individual agent, running against the grain of the agency.A very good movie, recommended to anyone who likes the double cross, triple cross type suprise or the little man outsmarting the big arrogant man.Buy it - view it - enjoy it."
4,A cool thriller,"This is the most underarted spy movie of our times. Its a well made, well narrated movie packed with really cool plots and action. But somehow it got lost in the aftermath of 9/11. Otherwise, to all those spy thriller fans, this a movie to watch. Both Brad Pitt and Robert Redford do justice to their characters."
3,A very interesting start but...,"...it faltered during the way. With the very attention-catching beginning, I expected the rest of the film to be exciting & action-packed. I was disappointed to find the film quite bland & lacked emotion.Majority of the movie consisted of flashbacks which 'SUPPOSEDLY' explained the close ties between the master spy & his protege. But despite establishing their proximity, the emotional link seemed poor. Either the movie failed to impart such degree of closeness to the viewers or I simply failed to grasp it.In any case, I found the plot interesting...but bland."
5,Spy World,"the first time i saw this movie i was surprised by the excellent job, now i am happy to watch it in hd"
4,Good Guys,"Good movie to have and stay with, both main actors are a real classic, will make for a good collection addition."
3,"Good, just not Great","Robert Redford and Brad Pitt are working for the CIA and are also good friends. We never see them together on stage, except through the use of flashbacks. Eventually the flashbacks tell the story, told as ""slices of life"", as opposed to a plotted theme.Brad Pitt is captured by the Chinese, tortured, and sent to the same prison where his girl friend was jailed. Robert Redford knows he has only 24 hours to make a deal with his captors, but the political conditions in Washington favor doing nothing. So, Redford takes the initiative and personally arranges for his freedom.After all was said and done, I think that Pitt allowed himself to be captured to be with his girl friend and knew that his very good friend Redford would find a way to get them out."
2,digital copy not available outside of US,"I ordered this in large part for the digital copy. However, when I went online with the authorization code it denied me because I was logging on outside of the US. Amazon should be clearer about this in advertising this and similar bluray/dvd/digital copy sets."
5,Truly enjoyable.,"This spy movie takes you in unexpected directions, yet always makes sense. The basic plot surrounds robert Redford who plays a veteren CIA officer. He is due to retire from the CIA, but learns his protege is in trouble. What he then does will have you cheering.The casting is dead on and all the actors do an excellent job of portraying their characters. The story is well crafted, but never gets so serious that you can't enjoy yourself."
2,Could have be good but cheapened by pervasive and unnecessary and childish background music,Not much to add to all the other reviews except that the effects and good acting were totally spoilt by the ever present and irritating music in the background. Every scene has some form of annoying music which changes in an ad hoc fashion. There is no need for it and in the end cheapens the movie - I could not wait for it to end - it irritated me so much Such a pity - two good actor messed up by the sound effects people. I felt so relieved in the few parts that had no artificial background noise.
2,Short Movie,"It only 5 minutes story. The story shows how to feed their babies and how they fly, with the beautiful music in the background. The DVD cover is good but the DVD media is very poor. (It looks like used when I got it)"
2,Dual disk problems!,"This disk would not work in two differentdrives in my computers and in my regular cd player (a Samsung) it would take over a minute to load and then would not play track one (but played the others ok). Not so happy with this.As for the music, it is a clasic."
2,"Entire case, front and back, cracked everywhere!","The entire CD case was cracked all over and it appeared that it was put in a blank CD case, was not original casing or brand new as stated in product description."
3,Not all that good,"I thought there was more to this group. I guess it's hard to imagine how new this kind of music must have sounded in its time, but since so many other groups did syntho-pop in the 80's as well, this band got lost in the historical shuffle. Does this track sound distinctly New Order, or is it Depeche Mode? Or maybe Dead or Alive? Sad thing is that ""Bizarre Love Triangle"" is a masterpiece, and other songs on this album set could have been improved if someone had worked on them a little longer. The salvation of a lot of techno music is in its complexity. If a synth tune is limited to one repetitive theme and a dozen or so forgettable words, it loses some of its punch."
4,New Order,"This is a great compilation of New Order's works up to 1987. New Order shouldn't be considered just an 80's synth-dance-band. New Order is the regrouping of Joy Division after the untimely loss of Ian Curtis. Joy Division and New Order embody some of the most raw music ever to be released. New Order is still releasing albums today (at that still releasing great albums) way after its counterparts disbanded. If you want to get into New Order, but don't know where to start, then you should buy this compilation first."
4,Prototypical new-wave dance music,"This is some of the most infectious synth-pop music I have heard. Starting with ""Temptation"" and ""Blue Monday,"" New Order creates a swirling world of synthesizers and percussion. Though their best song, ""Love Vigilantes"" is conspicuously absent (you'll find it on Low Life), there is still plenty captivating music here, like ""Perfect Kiss,"" ""State of the Nation,"" ""bizarre Love Triangle,"" and the bittersweet ""True Faith,"" which closes Disc 1. Disc 2 is a hodgepodge of unreleased material and B-sides that will appeal to devoted New Order fans, but nothing that is as outstanding as the first disc. So, 5 stars for Disc One + 3 stars for Disc Two = a 4 star rating. (Note: those on a budget or who just want the creme de la creme of New Order are advised to search for the cassette or 2-LP vinyl version, which only has the songs from Disc 1.)"
5,It's Substance...what else?,"I've listened to this more times than I've told my Dad that I love him. Maybe my priorities are wrong but this album is practically a family member. A genius overview of New Order's early and mid-career that they should have stuck to on later compilations. The songs here are classics. Some of the best dance music ever made, some of the best rock and roll ever made and some of the best pop ever made with some of the best song titles ever. All put togther with something so sadly lacking in today's ugly world..a little thing called..class.A masterpiece."
1,Worth boycotting on principle,"New Order was a singles band who did their best work in the 12"" format. However, none of Warner Brothers' six - count 'em, six - compilations contain all of those original 12"" mixes. ""Substance"" has the most of them. But it replaces the original versions of ""Temptation"" and ""Confusion"" with re-recordings - and lops a minute or more off ""The Perfect Kiss"", ""Sub-Culture"", and ""Shellshock"". To remedy these defects, Warner Brothers requires you to purchase ""Collector's Editions"" of the three separate albums containing those songs. [If you do a web search for ""sorting out the New Order compilations"", you can get full details.]Well, screw that. All of the music from the original 12"" records is available for free on the Internet, if you know where to look. You can also get the original sleeve art - something else ""Substance"" couldn't be bothered with."
3,Missing Better Originals!,"Where is the original Temptation and Confusion?????Instead of reworking these tracks, they should have reworked tracks that were available on their standard catalog. But temptation is from an EP that is long out of print and Confusion was a 12"" single that I have never seen on CD.Because these tracks are so hard to find, I am only giving this compilation 3 stars since it was a horrible decision not to also include the original versions of these songs."
5,1983,"The usual new wave was playing that morning in 1983, Kids in America, etc... Then the first thumps came on from what was Blue Monday. I've been hooked ever since. For a 13 year old boy, this was heavy stuff. Most of my friends were listening to Def Leppard or Motley Crue but I found heaven when I discovered New Order. They were never an album band for me, that is until Technique, they were more of a 12 inch band. Those fabulous vinyl pieces of art. This is the way New Order was meant to be heard. So turn it up, and put on your dancing shoes."
3,Could have been better,"wonderful band in the early years...unfortunately this ""best of"" is severely marred by the addition of a remade ""temptation"" which knocked them into the same boat with the Pet Shop Boys when they remade a perfectly good ""west end girls"". Unfortunately the original version of temptation was about as perfect a song could get therefore the act far more loathsome. I never did hear the original again on the radio so i just bought it recently on the only cd i could find that had it...the soundtrack for the movie ""Something Wild""...an abridged version that was heard playing for a fleeting moment fron an old corvette that drove by."
2,Great basic PIC book- literally.,"This is a good beginner's book on PIC 16F84 microcontrollers as long as you don't mind spending an additional $100 for a third party PIC BASIC code compiler. All of the book's lessons and programs are based on this BASIC compiler (no commonality to Microchip's MPLAB). There are some truly useful projects described such as serial communication, servo motor control and switch inputs, so if your goal is to get a design up and running quickly, this might be for you. It would be more accurately described as a user manual for the BASIC compiler rather than a PIC microcontroller reference. I was kinda bugged that this wasn't mentioned in the book's description."
2,Starter book-not quiet,"I recently bought this book in order to learn Pic programming and avoid learning assembly language. I tought that my begginer knowledge of C++ will be enough to understand Basic. But it was not so. Lots of program structure explanation used in Basic is omitted and simply assumed. I did not mind that the book reffers to only one tool for programming as that is the best way for the begginer to go. However, if you have no prior Basic language knowledge, stay away from this book!"
4,The Pendulum's Path,"I am normally one of those people who starts a book, gets bored quickly and never finishes. I have at least three started novels under my bed collecting dust. Since the birth of my daughter 4 months ago, my life now has no time for extracurricular anything.With that said, I couldn't put The Pendulum's Path down. I got it on a Wednesday and by the next Wednesday, I had finished the entire thing. The characters were so complex, the story is riveting and incredibly thought-provoking, and I found my emotions right on the surface from the first chapter. I identified personally with the mother/daughter relationship between Delilah and Emma. I have seen the exact same thing happen between my mother and grandmother. Dave Shields wrote a novel that shows the complexities of all families through the Crumps. Even though you don't know this family, you feel close to them instantly. A thumbs up to Mr. Shields for a great book that collected no dust in my house."
5,Very original!,"As unlike the stereotypes of the ""Middle East"" as you'd hope to find. These poets are really fresh and new; some of them have avant-garde weird images and sexual references, and some are more traditional; some are funny, some are sad; some of them are talking about their experiences in their own country and some are talking more generally. The translation hardly shows at all; you could be reading Laurie Jackson, or at times the early Beats. If you like poetry, or are interested in other cultures - or perhaps are interested in finding out that we're not so different after all - buy it.(Bonus: If you're a student of translation, Arabic poetry, or just of Arab issues, there's a very informative introduction about the ancient Arabic poetry tradition and how it's been an influence on modern writers. For me, it was worth the price of the book just for this info.)"
5,Fantastic,This man was absolutely fantastic. I was impressed by his persistance in pursuit of goals he set for himself. I wish I could have known him.
5,love it,i love this album. in the shadows of britpop came this quirky hindi singing band. thou the album is mostly in english its still a good rock album. i love it and always have. reminds me of when i was 16 again!
5,Cool Kula,"I've owned this record for some years now and I never get tired of listening to it. KS's music is britpop/rock combined with Indian music. Very special; mysterious and exciting. Make you feel you are on a journey to India. Think they've been listening a bit to George Harrison in his experimental days...As always I like the songs with a melancholic background best. ""Into the deep"" and ""Start all over"" got these elements. Calm and very beautiful. But these are just the jewels in the Crown.Kula Shaker; I really miss you!!"
2,company of heroes,Not near as much fun as I thought it was going to be. Would pass if I had the chance.
1,tasteless water is what you get,"this is the worst coffee i have ever had. all you get is literally warm water. my secretary and i both tried it, then dumped the cups and the pot. it tasted like warm diluted milk, sans coffee."
3,"Cool clock, but...","This is a nifty clock but it is useless as a bedside or nighttime clock. It has such low contrast on the display (which is analog and digital) that you have to turn up the brightness almost all the way to read the time at night.So when it's 3:00 in the morning and you wake up it's VERY HARD to read the time, unless the brightness is on max. And if it's on maximum, it illuminates the entire room. Maybe you are like me as sick of all the gadgets in my bedroom with little lights on them.Anyway, you've been warned. It's a great clock but I have not enjoyed using it when it is dark."
5,Love it,This is my second UDY perfume... I just love the perfume.. One of the best perfumes I ever used. Comes in a nice girly pack as well.
1,OK ....a show of hands to outlaw Zombie movies forever?,"I like Milla, I like the Zombiedogs, they don't like her. Milla turns into Carrie-Anne Moss, runs around a wall, and kicks a dog in the head. If you saw this in the trailer, then you have already seen the highlight of this flick.HELLO....ASPCA, where are you? This movie is an affront to all genetically altered killer zombie dobermans and their owners everywhere.I can't imagine this thing generating enough attention to justify a sequel. One of the worst I've ever seen. But, if you just can't get enough of zombie movies, and you thought Blade II was cool, and you asked your mommie for an X-Box for Christmas, then you'll probably like this thing. 1 Moooltiepass, to get me as far away as possible."
3,An alright film,"Well, in my own opinion, I liked this movie. I mean, by no means was it a great flick, but I had fun watching it. As previously stated, no, it doesn't follow any of the games' plots directly. However, Umbrella's still the evil corporation, the T-Virus is still the, well, virus. Not to mention, that the filmmakers have, in fact, taken scenes from the games and stuffed 'em right in the flick. I won't go into detail about them, but suffice it to say that if you've played the games, you'll notice these scenes recreated for the movie. Now, in conclusion, this isn't an intelligent movie, or an extremely well-acted movie, however, it can be fun to watch if you don't get caught up in how they strayed from the games, or if you don't mind dumb movies. Plus there's something eerie about watching stuff from games I've been playing for years acted out on the big screen."
5,wow,"Terrific horror thriller which is pretty intense from the word go.Being a big fan of the playstation games I was looking forward to this and was not disappointed.It does deviate away somewhat from the game but retains enough elements to make it familiar.The 5.1 Dolby Digital mix is absolutely astonishing.It's impressively full-on ,incredibly directional and really gives your sub woofer a thorough work-out.Fantastic."
1,"Love the movie, hate the edition","This version has been edited...I'm guessing..per Millia's request...aka shower scene is almost completely gone.Granted it is a nudity scene yes, however I don't want to pay of something that has been edited down...if I didn't want blood, sex and violence I'd watch network tv."
3,just a clarification..,"I never played the games, but that didn't stop me from enjoying this film. The pacing and fx are pretty top-notch, as is the direction... I would give Resident Evil three and a half stars, only because although it is a fun ride, it still is pretty mindless-popcorn-munching cinema. You could do much worse, though. Anyone looking for a good escape into horror without having to think should really enjoy this bloody little opus."
1,Anderson succeeds yet again at ruining another movie,"If he had had any sense, he would have done a direct adaptation of the game, like the killer novelization. But no, Anderson has to do his own thing, and he saps the plot of most of its intrigue, adding his own horrible touches. The movie's opening was confusing, the acting was mediocre at best, and the music, as usual, is totally forgettable. Any movie with zombies has the potential for being scary, but Anderson's pounding metal score ruined any atmosphere the film could have had. All of the monsters, save a horribly adapted Licker, are cut from the movie. The entire movie was painfully boring, save one scene involving a security laser, which was the only redeeming thing about this horrible film. If this reflects his adaptation plans for 'Resident Evil: Nemesis' or the dreaded AvP movie, then we're sure to be greeted with two more pathetic, horrible jobs."
2,A visual treat but empty,"Resident Evil was fascinating as a visual, technical piece but overall empty as a movie. And as a horror movie, there were no thrills, no jumps, no real scares. I anticipated every zombie, mutant doggie jummping out from corners. Most of all, I kept wondering why Milla Jovovich, who is such a good actress, deliverd such a flat and emotionaless performance."
2,Resident Evil fans need not apply,"This movie was not at all like the game. They put a big twist on the first resident evil, by putting the members of s.t.a.r.s. under ground instead in the mansion where they belong. The movie added new members to s.t.a.r.s. that did not exist. The movie had a horrible storyline, of Jill Valentine waking up in the shower and dicovering that she was a member of s.t.a.r.s.. The original story was that Jill, Chris, Barry and Wesker were forced to stay in the mansion because there helicopter pilot abandoned them. The only thing from the game that the movie had right was the zombies. This movie only desreves 2 stars because first it was a bad movie and secondly it was not true to the original story. I hope that the sequel is true to Resident evil three."
4,I liked this movie.,"It was exactly what I expected and even a little more. Very stylish movie with a lot of fast paced action, and Milla is hot throughout. It seems that either most people liked it or hated it. It is a rental for sure, and if you're like me you'll probably buy it."
4,the dead will walk,"I've been a huge fan of video game-based movies from ""Super Mario Bros"" to ""Mortal Kombat"", but I strongly think that ""Resident Evil"" is one of the best game-based movies out there. The monster in the film looks like something from ""The Relic"", but without the eyes, and it's absolutely terrifying. The mutant dogs were pretty graphic too, but just as cool. The cast (Milla Jovovich & Michelle Rodriguez) does an excellect job playing members of a commando unit, sent in to investigate a viral outbreak that turned all employees into zombies. I wonder how the sequel is gonna be like!!!"
2,"""Resident Evil"" is a noisy mess","I`m one of the fans of the video game {Resident Evil} the game is really scary but with the movie nothing scary here exceptfor some awful acting and lame special effects in fact the video game is a lot more fun than the film.All we hope for is some cool special effects and fight scenes But even on that level, ""Resident Evil"" is a disappointment.I do not think being a fan of the game could've possibly improved my enjoyment of this film."
3,Is it [weak] or [weaker]???,"This movie is a no-no except for those who expect only bashing and crashing. You won't like it unless you don't want a good script, just eye-candy and kung-fu. Milla Jovovich is somekind of a Superwoman with a temporary amnesia and the movie is filled with errors that were just about impossible to miss. The director is the man who made the Mortal Kombat movie, so if you saw it you know what to see in this thingie.If you liked the video game though, you might like the because it follows the pattern and Ms. Milla shows more than just her attitude..."
2,Not a very good showing of high definition,"First off, let me say this. I love the Resident Evil movies, almost as much as the first 3 games. That being said let me best describe my review in a short but concise way as to why I gave it 2 stars.I have this movie on DVD as well. I have an upscaling DVD player. My upscaled DVD version of this movie looks almost exactly the same as the supposed High Definition Blu Ray version using a PS3 on a Sharp Aquos 1080p LCD TV. I don't know the reason behind the lack of fidelity and image clarity, but honestly, except to say you have the Blu Ray version with the rest (I got the 2nd movie for free in that 5 free movies deal), go with upscaled DVD. The sound quality is better on BluRay, but not so much better it warrants buying the Blu Ray over the regular DVD movie.Heck, I saw it on TV on an HD channel and it looked the same, that is, nothing special.So it looks ok, but don't expect superb quality, and instead expect a lot of graininess."
5,Great God!! Milla is a goddess!!,"I expected Milla Jovovich to do a great jop and I wasnt wrong. She did a great jop (and hell she looks sexy!) The rest of the cast was good too. The acting is solid, the plot is faithfull to the RE series and the Soundtrack kicks...go see this movie, you wont be dissapointed!"
1,I cannot believe anyone liked this!,"since everyone is giving this good reviews i have to weigh in.first id have to say there was hardly any gore.the acting was painfully hard to watch.and ive never seen a zombie movie where the ""hero"" takes out the zombies barehanded martial arts style.Im not even sure if this was supposed to be a horror movie or an action movie.but at any rate it was ...and i would avoid at all cost.it would have been so much beter with romero!"
4,Darn good movie!,"Excellent movie altogether. Nice storyline, character developement. I was on the edge of my seat as I watched this movie in the theatre even after the 4th time. Yes, I saw it 4 times in the theatre. What can I say? I loved this one. And what really surprised me was how clean and tame it was. Granted there were some gross scenes but I was expecting all-out gory-bloody messes left and right like the movie. So I was very impressed by that.Why did I give it only 4 stars you ask? Well for two reasons: One, the director totally strayed from the video game story line. And this movie was mainly bent on the pleasing the fan boys. And nothing makes a fan boy more mad than straying from the game storyline. And seccond: All the Milla fanboy pleasing scenes were not needed at all. I got a little disturbed in the end when she was wearing that lovely hospital gown.But don't let that stop you from purchasing this great movie. It's good none the less."
3,Good...if you happen to be a 13 year old boy.,"While the actual story line behind the movie is genuinely good and unique, it's extremely underdeveloped. The vast majority of the film's 101 minutes is spent focusing on flesh eating zombies. Yes, you read that right *Flesh Eating Zombies*. If that just happens to be something your into - more power to you! But if not, you might want to make this one a rental. Aside from the zombies, the story keeps you interested, it moves along quickly, the special effects are good, and it gives a nice sequel suggestion at the end."
1,DVD didn't work.,"I purchased this DVD thinking I had gotten a major deal. All that I got was a malfunctioning DVD. It was fine the first 10 minutes, but then it stopped working. I'm extremely disappointed by this product."
4,Let's hope this will be good,"Let's all hope this isn't another failed video game turned movie.I was already driven away by Tomb Raider, Super Mario, and Street Fighter (ugh that was painful to watch).If the filmakers decided to enlist help from people who are familiar with the series, it could be good. If not, maybe there will a special...If the movie stinks, then the soundtrack won't. After all, they did get new tracks from Slipknot and Static X.Either way, let's pray this won't stink. And let's pray it makes more money than E.T. when it comes out that same week."
5,The best horror i've ever seen,"I went to the theater expecting as usual a bad movie for a good game will it was nothing as i expected, It was just Splashing active bloody movie, I was thrilled from the story the visual effects & sound effects, I mean you are on your feet tell the end of the movie it's a different story to the usual resident evil problem...!!!I won't say anything about the movie but it's a good one, so if you like action, science fiction, and real horror just see it.!"
2,"Crap, even for a videogame-turned-movie","With the great cast and a cool plot, this could have been a pretty good movie. However, it just takes all the usual scare tactics to new lows (disappearing bodies, constant gore including a very graphic scene involving lazers, etc.). There is about one cool scene in the whole thing, not including the beginning and end shots of a very exposed Milla Jovovich. Well, there's always that upcoming sequel..."
5,Not an average video game adaptation,"Although based on a video game, the movie has an original screenplay which explains the cause of the T-virus outbreak which is the focus of the video game series. You do not need to have played the video game to watch this film. In fact, the plot is not entirely congruent with the video games series.The special effects are well done and the eerie score really adds to the atmosphere of the film. The picture quality on Blu-ray is excellent.The movie is strong enough to stand on its own in the sci-fi/horror genre without any tie-in to its video game ancestry. The sequels; however, are both disappointing when compared to the potential shown in this film with the last film in the series being the better of the two sequels."
5,This is a GOOD horror/action movie!,"Yes, it's based off of a video game. Yes, the plot is thin. Were you expecting effin' Shakespeare? This is the best video game to movie adaptation there is. Also, one of the better zombie movies. It's a hell of a lot better than 28 Days Later. And, for my money, better than the remake of Dawn of the Dead. Which was good. This is a movie for people who want to see things shot, blown up, etc. That's why people make/watch these. If you expect more, then you only have yourself to blame and shouldn't trash the movie because of it. All in all this is a great movie as well as the sequel."
2,Some problems here,"While the construction of the radio seems to be OK, its the radio itself that is dissapointing. After turning the radio on and selecting the channel to listen to, aprox 10 minutes later I have to retune the dial. Drift seems to be a big issue with this radio. In the world of electronics there should be a better lock on the station than this. I have to adjust for drift throughout the day using this radio. Its not just once but several times a day."
2,BUYER BEWARE,THE YELLOW RADIO WITH A BAD ANTENNA FOR HOW MUCH 80.00 TO 123.00 BUCKS FOR THE PRICE OF THE RADIO U WOULD THINK THEY COULD PUT ON A GOOD ANTENNA AND FINE TUNE THE TUNER SO THE RADIO DONT LOSE STATIONS AND THEN THEY WOULD LIKE U TO SEND 8 TO 10 DALLARS FOR RETURN SHIPMENT AFTER U HAVE ALREADY PAYED TO SHIP IT TO THEM--------- COME ON SANGEN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,Not pratical for learning any useful programming,"I have tried making my way through this book many times. But I cannot get past the author's incessesant penchant for the mayan calendar. I did not find any use in going through code snippets (which are very hard to read, they are screenshots in small font)that taught me how to manipulate dates (leap years, mayan calendars etc.) I found this approach extremely boring. Infusing text with an occasionally comment of marginal wit, does not make it entertaining.The only redeeming portion of this book it that it does include a good introduction to Tkinter. I just wish someone with a better understanding of instructional writing had written it.Like so many other Python books, does every introduction to subjects such as funtions, classes, objects and methods have to be about spam? I know where python got its name...but enough already!"
2,Not too good,"The book is very hard to read. It starts out fine, but the author seems to care more about Mayan calendars and Zen more than teaching Python to the reader. The first chapters about variable types don't give you anything much to practice on. The author says ""a simple example"" and doesn't explain parts of it until three chapters later. Other examples are in screen shots which can barely be read. Also annoying is the author's tendency to drift away from the subject and start talking about dead painters or other non-programming related topics. This book could use a lot of work"
5,"J.C.Bach: Piano Concertos, op.13 nrs, 4-6, & 14","I heard the first movement on my car radio on the way home from work, and knew that I had to have it. The music is so lively and free, and with a period Fortepiano, the sound is so marvelous that it just envelopes a person and you become one with it. If a person likes lively, early music on period instruments (modern instruments don't even come close), then this CD, and its sibling are just the ticket to an hour or so's listening enjoyment."
5,Exactly what I expected,Good quality and this looks great in my baby's nursery that is travel-themed. Definitely worth the price. Wish they still had in purple too.
1,"Absolutely love this band, absolutely hate this CD","This sounds like a constipated chicken. The first time I saw it I thought it was a collection of trashy outtakes, but no it's a weirdo's delight. I mean c'mon this is kinda for weird (""Give Me It""?).I'd also like to bring up a song that particularly sounds horrible. That would be ""Give Me It."" That's what sounds like a constipated chicken. Robert Smith is like ""ahhhhoooo"" and ""rawkkkkk"" and ""SCREAMING FOR LOVE, SCREAMING FOR AIR"" which is exactly what you hear from a constipated farm animal. You hear them go ""SCREAMING FOR ICE CREAM, SCREAMING FOR RELIEF"" when they're constipated, so I believe Robert Smith knows what I do."
3,it must be every copy...,"yes, my intro is also cut off. three stars though is for the album--although i love the cure, this is not one of their best. that being said, it does contain some real gems: 'birdmad girl' is one of my favorite cure songs, also 'the caterpillar,' 'piggy in the mirror' and the divine 'dressing up'"
3,the standing on the beach thing,"okay, to settle this little beach/sea thing, it was called standing on the beach. the cassette is called that. it has all oftheir be sides from the era and the other side has their singles. staring at the sea was its name when itwas released to cd. it has more of the singles on it."
4,Unlike any other Cure album! This is when they expanded!,"I love this album. It's full with different beats, very dreamy at sometimes (dressing up), very cute (birdmad girl, the caterpillar, piggy in the mirror) very up beat (shake dog shake, give me it), very good instruments (birdmad girl, wailing wall especially) The empty world is an ok song, the only track on here skipable. All in all I would give it ***`, one of my favorite Cure albums!!! Goes great with Wild Mood Swings :)"
3,Gorgeous but unwieldy and busy,"I used to have this deck, and agree that it is beautiful and incorporates many streams of knowledge. But that can also work to its detriment; one can get very distracted trying to follow it all, and lose the flow of reading or meditation. Also, the cards are quite large, and I found them too awkward to hold. If you are OK with both of those caveats, it's a gorgeous deck!!"
5,Very good book for anyone who's starting to learn Spanish.,"This not where you rate an order from a seller. A review is an evaluation of a publication such as a book, music CD, or a movie. So, I'm not going to write a review just stating how the textbook was delivered or how it looked. The textbook is very helpful, very easy to learn, and is up to date with the modern Spanish vernacular. The software was helpful. It's easy to find anything in the book. The Quia website was easy to go along with, too."
3,Dance into the nite,"An effort at consolidating Madonna's position on the dancefloor, You Can Dance offers some of the remixes of her well-known hits as well as the previously unreleased Spotlight. Great for some club spins...especially with the first 7 tracks that continue without a break..."
4,Only when Im dancing can I feel this free!!!!,"Im back on this review! YOU CAN DANCE !! I dint buy this cd till 1998, But I had the casette that was given to me, I love how all the song's are blended in one after another. I really like Spotlight, how she sing's ( DONT BE AFRAID TO FALL- ILL HEAR YOU WHEN YOU CALL AND ILL BE BY YOUR SIDE) I like that line. Anyway its a good album. sounds good especially for its era 1987-88. And who ever sais its a a flop do to its sales world wide is screwed up in the head!! It did good for its time, now at 1.7 million copies in the U.S soon to be double platinum. 5 million WWD. so what thats good. Look who followed Paula Abdul,Jennifer lopez and now Mariah Carey. I will not be supprised if Janet Jackson or Cher will do the same. thanks Rico 4 stars"
3,No Longer In Vogue,"Give credit to Madonna for this 1987 foray into remix, but, aside from the dance quality, the music itself doesn't wear wear. The disco/techno sound is, at this date, stereotypical, and suffers by not being really either disco or techno. While the music moves, much of the album sounds dated and gimmicky. At worst, it's a parody of itself (double beats, tiresome voiceovers, ""exotic"" electronic voicings, repeated clipped vocal loops -""come-c'-c'-c'-come-come""-, superficial lyrics about empowerment, etc.)Madonna's great vocal technique is the inversion from high to low tone as well as an appealing slightly nasal quality, but too often her voice is covered by the busy arrangement. On the best songs here, you can hear some vocal power, but this is secondary to the instrumentation. So, power this baby up for a retro dance thing, but musically, this is disappointing."
4,Interesting compilation of information,"Contains fair amount of information; Due to ever changing conditions, the text is becoming outdated."
1,Very Biased,"On reading this book I am struck by its one-sided bias toward an Israeli view particularly of events in 1947-1949. It is frustrating and disappointing that the author chosen to write this book is a pro-Israeli activist. His pro-Israeli bias comes through clearly in the narrative of this book. It is frustrating because it becomes a propaganda piece, clothed in a garment of objectivity. A real coup for the pro-Israeli lobby, and a defeat for intellectual honesty about the historical events in this area."
1,Disappointing for a Complete Idiot's Guide; VERY Biased,"While I realize it's hard not to be biased about the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, I think we all expect the Complete Idiot's Guide series to be more factual & even-handed, rather than grossly opinionated. Mr Bard gives no voice to the Palestinian or humanist sides of things.If you want to learn more about this subject - along with all of the Middle East, I'd recommend The Middle East for Dummies. This writer gives both sides of the story and reminds me of the diversity and plain sense of ""just wanting to get by"" that everyone in the world shares.Also, note that many of the reviewers for this book (as well as the Dummies book) are very biased themselves - just check out their other reviews. It's pretty shocking. Example: Jill Malter - she lists herself as a ""zionist"" on her profile. How do you think that affects her opinions here?"
4,"""Very Informative--More Than You'd Ever Want to Know!""","It was bound to happen--an idiot's guide to the Middle East! As a theologian and teacher, and with Middle Eastern tensions flaring, I decided to check this one out, and see if Bard had done his research. He had.While there is an unbiased pro-Israeli slant to the book, there is more information than you could probably digest in a year.Bard (rightly) traces the conflict back to Abraham, and follows the history factually and thoroughly. He discusses the Koran, the Bible, Mohammed, Arab oil, Jewish nationalism (1948), as well as Zionistic and Palestinian conflicts up to (nearly) current times. Virtually every cogent subject dealing with the conflict is discussed in a (reasonably) easy-to-read format.I learned much from this book, and despite the rhetoric against it in some of these reviews due to its Jewish bias, the work is well worth the reading if you REALLY want to know all the material packed within its pages...and there's an awful lot there."
3,Not the best from Depeche,"This is a nice collection of Depeche oldies. Unfortunately, most of this songs are not the best from this band, specially the older, poppy ones. I would skip this one and start from Black Celebration."
4,great clock radio with docking station,I bought this clock radio based on teac's good reputation.After tryin a few other manufacturers I was glad I tried this.It has very good sound for a clock radio. It is not a bose butit only cost $100.00. The features are good and the radio workslike it is suppose to. No problems. Would definitley reccomend this.Save your self some time and do not buy all the ihome products.This is the one to buy for ipod docking clock radio.
1,what even is this?,"Even though I had already read and disliked ""A Portrait of a Lady"", I decided to give James another try. Disappointing. There is absolutely no plot, nothing happens, no comedy, no romance. I only finished it since I wanted to grow my read pile and reach my goal, and it is a really short epistolary novel. I wouldn't recommend this at all."
4,Good Halter--Misleading Color,"Hamiltons have always been great. The halter is of good materials, attractive, and well built. However, the color was not as advertised and the blue was much duller and a little darker than the one in the picture. Please try to accurately represent your products in the future! Beware, you have no idea what color you will get.Either way, love it."
3,It was Hell to watch,At first seeing the previews for From Hell I thought of a great movie depiciting the murders of Jack the Ripper. This movie falls short of anything to do with Jack the Ripper. From Hell is about Depps drug addiction and his love for a hooker. Both the Characters and the plot are thin as paper. Small bits of info are given throughout the movie leading to nothing. I and my friends were completely bored. Once people start getting up and begin talking you know a movie has fallen short of what it set out to accomplish. I keep looking at my watch just waiting for it to end. Rent but only in need of a movie.
4,Well done horror flick!,"This is not an all out horror film that the Hughes brothers crafted, but an interesting mystery that makes you wonder why Albert and Allen Hughes made it. If you compare it to they're other movies it is not at all the same. Dead Presidents, Menace II Society and American Pimp may have been films about the streets but this is a whole new ballgame. There is some really good imagery filmed here as well that you may not expect had anyone else directed the film. To tell you the truth, I'm starting to get sick of Johnny Depp. His role in From Hell was too reminiscent to his role in Sleepy Hollow (which I also recommend). This is a good movie however and it is one of the best of 2001 in my books."
3,The Hughes Brothers do it again,The Hughes's are two of the best African Amercian directors ever to direct. Their last film From Hell displays their talent for horror and suspense with his movie. The film plays it smart by not showing the killer's face till the end and the death's are never shown.Johnny Depp and Heather Graham both give winning performances and this film is very highly reccomned.
3,Depp needed better supporting cast,I have to give this movie 3 stars just because Depp is in it. I feel this movie would have been SO much better if Johnny had had a decent leading lady.
4,Interesting view on Jack the Ripper.,"I bought this dvd about Jack the Ripper sight unseen because it looked like it would be a good movie, this movie absolutely blew me away. After seeing this movie I realized how cruel royalty and the people devoted to protecting them would go to great lengths to protect their own. This version portrayed the killer as a great docter and friend to Qneen Elizabeth and you cannot tell me that she did know about the killings about these five women who were friends with the young girl and the prince. She knew because she must have paid the good docter to do the deeds and denied young Alice her right to royalty that she deserved. I have seen several movies about Jack and have seen several documentaries and always could never quite put it together,but this movie the only fault was the romance with Mary Kelly and young lieutenent it just seemed that it did not go well with the rest of the story, but it did some romance and depth to the movie."
1,Gratuitous violence,"The premise for this movie is facinating, and it could have been outstanding. The violence was excessive and really detracted from the suspense because of its overwhelming nature. Johnny Depp is a very good actor--it's a shame his talent is wasted by the director's poor vision of what a good mystery should be."
1,HAHAHAHAHHAHA,"Taken on its own terms...this film is bad. When compared to the book it is based on, it simply becomes a joke."
4,Great,I have looked high and low and couldn't seem to find this movie. Thank you for providing a quality product so promptly too!!! Happy Holidays!
4,From Hell,THEY TELL THE HISTORY OF EXCELLENT NARRATED WELL MOVIE THE RAPID WELL DELIVERY IN GOOD CONDITIOTHEY TELL THE HISTORY OF EXCELLENT NARRATED WELL MOVIE THE RAPID WELL DELIVERY IN GOOD CONDITIONSNS.
3,"Derivative, but INTENSE","Although I found the plot to be incredibly like that in an earlier, excellent film MURDER BY DECREE, what really struck me about this telling of the Jack the Ripper story was that it brought back, brought 'home' if you will, the terror that the women must have experienced when these murders were happening, and usually the women in previous Ripper films seem to little better than props for the legend. It reminded me that there were all too real victims of this man and no one deserves to die in that manner. If only poor Mary Kelly had had the fate the movie gives her instead the one she really had."
2,From Hell but not scary,Just looking to buy a good hooro movie and saw this a week ago. Not taht sitting on a stapler feeling. therfor I dizz it.
2,Not My Cup Of Tea,"Since many viewers of this film found it wonderful, I will avoid harsh opinions directed to it's production and storyline. I totally agree that the set's were beautiful. The one thing this movie did was take you on a journey to Victorian England. Other than that, it didn't do much for me. It might have helped if I was a Johnny Depp fan, but I haven't really cared for his work since his 21 Jump Street days.I will say this: to all of you out there who like a fast paced, exciting, edge of your seat, heart pounding, can hardly catch your breath adrenaline rush sort of film - AVOID this movie. I honestly almost walked out. I sort of came to the point to where I wasn't sure if I should walk out or fall asleep. However, in respect to my date who accompanied me, I sat through it, only to find out she would have walked out with me as well. ..."
2,From Hell,"From Hell is an okay second-rate thriller, but too slow, too predictable, and too poorly directed to be anything more. This movie was supposed to be incredibly haunting, but it was even scary. there were some casting mistakes: like Heather Graham, who plays a prostitute that is the final target of Jack the Ripper. She did not give a very bad performance, but she did give a weak one. She has no talents whatsoever as an actress and the expressions on her face is so fake that you get tired iof her very quickly. Johnny Depp gives a strong performance, but you can't really understand what he's tyring to say. It seems like he keeps sluring everything. Like he's mumbling through out the whole movie. So, if you want to see some thrills, go see the movie. But if you are looking for a great thriller, I suggest you go see something else."
5,Freedom,Getting rid of the bagage of rejection was brought about with reading Rejection Junkies.Good info and helpful hits how to stay away from rejection.
2,Over Simplification,"I regret having to write a criticism of a fellow Unitarian's efforts on an all too important subject. The title of ""Learning to be White..."" leads one to believe that the issue discussed is, indeed, racism. When, in fact, Thandeka does little more than use race and racial references describing the human tendency to hang out with the ""tribe"". Whether the subjects of her study are white, black, hispanic, or other tribal thinking people, the issues of moving outside one's own social group are the same. Black kids bringing home white friends suffer the same shame and threat of abandonment that white kids do. Jewish, Catholic, Italian, Christian; every group who thinks that they have a lock on the good and right life feels threatened by outside strange influences."
1,So disappointined,"This product is exactly what I wanted. Would have loved this product and given it 5 stars but, it was soooooo badly damaged during shipping that there was no way it could ever have been used. I was so disappointed on the day it was delivered when I saw what condition the box was is. The fault is not with the product but with the shipping. It arrived in a single over-sized cardboard box with one piece of brown paper in and around it. One side was totally flat from being dropped so many times and the granite glaze was destroyed in several places on the kettle. Don't know whether to try and purchase another or not. I must consider this carefully."
2,"Stuff does stick, even with oil","I like the look of this pan, quick 1 minute preheat, and the even heating bottom surface. But stuff does stick even with oil, the good thing about the food that sticks it this enamel cleans up very easy. I know it says stick resistant but I would not use that term....I would say stuff sticks and you should be prepared for that."
4,Very good compliation,I only have listen to this cd like 3 times since i bought it a year ago but it is still a very good cd. I guess i like joy divison but cant listen to there cds all the time. I also have listen to closer which is good but very depressing. The best songs on here are Atmosphere and Love will tear us apart. But every song on this cd is decent and not one i skip when listening to it. This music was done in the late 70s and it still sounds fresh today. Bands like interpol and such would give there left nut to make music this good.
4,Substance indeed..,"Substance has been around for the past 20 years and I'm surprised to see that as many copies that have sold, it ""still"" hasn't been digitally remastered. I wish the record companies would stop making further compilations from this band as the latest comp. doesn't quite scratch the surface by containing enough of their best music for even newer fans to discover. ""Permanent"" wasn't bad but at least you'll hear newer versions of ""Interzone"" and ""Ice Age"" on their box set. Still, if you're a Joy Division fan like me, make sure to add this cd to your collection."
5,Great hat,"My 13 year old son loves his new camo hat. It fits him well, and he loves wearing it around."
2,WRONG SIZE!,"Based on other reviews, I ordered a size larger than I needed, and it is still way too small! It seems like too much of a pain to return, so it is a total waste."
4,Great Product,These gloves really did the job and were comfortable for my gardening. Even worked on brambles in the backyard! Would highly recommend
4,Dakar the hip-hop capital of Africa?,"In comparison to quantity of hip-hop acts in Africa, South Africa wins hands down. However if you are comparing via quality, West Africa, particulary Senegal is a thriving and inventive zone of hip-hop. Look no further than this album which really pioneered West African hip-hop. At times this album seems over produced, but the flow, and humor of the lyrics make this album an excellent experience. Perhaps French is the best language for rap, at least Postive Black Soul, along with another Senegalese born rapper, MC Solaar, make a point in favor of French as the smoothest language for rap."
4,Can Roger Manning do anything wrong (musically)?,"After the dissolution of the Jellyfish I was reluctant to listen to anything Roger or Andy produced. Imperial Drag came and went. I gave it a cursory listen but after the glory of ""Spilt Milk"" nothing could compare. Flash forward 10 years and I can't get enough of Imperial Drag. Then Roger releases my favorite album of 06 ""The Land of Pure Imagination"". So naturally when I found out about TV Eyes from his site, I was interested.As has been stated and restated, the album sounds like it was written and recorded in the 80's. You can detect the influences (""Mission: Submission"" has a distinct Gary Numan keyboard sound, the bass on ""What She Said"" sounds as if it were lifted directly from a Tones on Tail recording) yet the album is all original. The songwriting and the performances are solid.Standout tracks include ""Over the City"", ""Fascinating"", ""Love to Need"", and ""Fade Away""."
4,Great Songs!!!,"To all the Debbie Downer reviewers...let go of the past. To always have to bring up Jellyfish in anything Rodger or Jason does is just plain stupid. Everybody moves on in life and tries new/different things. Just because Jellyfish was amazing, (one of my all-time personal favorite bands) doesn't mean everything that happens after 1993 has to sound the same or be structured the same. It would be the same is expecting John Lennon's solo release, John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band, to sound like ""I Want To Hold Your Hand"" Meet The Beatles, Era. It's not supposed to sound the same. I know if I were a painter, I would sure get sick of painting the same picture...wouldn't you?All in all, this record is fun and the songs are great. It is what it is, pure synth pop."
3,Gibran never fails to show Jesus as just a man.,"There are few writers with as golden a pen as Kahlil Gibran. But he was not a Christian, who have always believed Jesus was literally the Son of God. For honest scholars who seek the truth,I suggest The Complete Works of Josephus, the works of Flavius Josephus,(c. a.d.37-100) author of at least 27 books of history. Translated by William Whiston (1667-1752)who was a mathmatician and church historian, and who succeeded Sir Isaac Newton as Lucasian professor of mathmatics at the University of Cambridge.All who read Josephus will learn more about the subject of Jesus than Gibran could have written in a dozen lives."
2,Finally Over,"Holy cow I am glad this series is over. Almost nothing happend in the entire series. That to me was the most annoying part.And I personally didn't care for the authors syle of writing. I prefere chapers as opposed to lenthly sections. And I have never been so frustrated in a book as this one. About half way through the book, he (the author) would write a few paragraphs of what is going on with these people get it all good and then jump to a totally different story line with different people. I don't mind that so much if you space it out some, but ""blah blah JUMP!, blah JUMP, blah JUMP, bl__ JUMP! I was going nuts. You have to read the first few maby one inbetween and last few pages out of 40 or so to find out what happend to anybody. Heaven forbid you do a entire story about what happend to this person at this time and then go on to another person/story. Very frustratingLike I said in my title, thank goodness this series is over; worst 3 books in NJO."
4,NJO/Living Planet,This was an interesting book. It was interesting to get an insight into a living planet's mind. It was also interesting to see how Luke and Jacen reacted. It will be intersting to see how this planet is going to play a role in upcoming events.
2,The Best Because It's Over,"The only reason this has 2 stars is that it was such a relief that this trilogy was over that this book actually seemed decent (sometimes.)I had a hard time deciphering excatly what the point of this trilogy was. I guess finding the planet, but by the time it happened, I didn't care anymore. I am a huge fan of SW and I always loved Luke Skywalker, but I just wanted to skim the pages that featured him, or Jacen for that matter. I am so tired of his back and forth (talk it out, take action, no wait talk it out.) I am ready for him to just do something already.Three books to get to Zonama Sekot and you still have no idea what it's significance is. And who is the force heretic? I still don't know.The only real worthwhile storyline was Tahiri. I have just started The Final Prophesy and had forgotten what it was like to get excited about reading these books again. Thankfully there is no Jacen yet."
2,"In Response To ""bland beyond belief""","I have to agree with the reviewer that this CD was not really worthy of Robin Gibb's talents but the tasteless remarks about him were over the top.Unless you actually know the man and his travel habits, how would you have any idea how much time he spends with his family or whether or not he saw Maurice in the months prior to his death?For being 15 years old, you certainly have a great command of the English language, with the help of whomever your footnote indicated edited your review. LOL"
1,Oh Please!,"I love Robin and his vocals. Hearing an old classic 'Love Hurts' is a treasure in the context of Robin's voice, HOWEVER, the rest of this material sounds like a desparate attempt to keep up with modern material..... ""Hello, get rid of the manager who gave 'thumbs up' on this one."""
1,condolences,"Except for ""Please"", a touch from our current time UGLY music has reached the beauty of the clear springs of the past.The first time to regret money i spent on a Gibb CD.I'll travel back to Egypt to get ""ONE"" and ""How old are you"" out of my old collection i left.I wished .., i wished even to see better photos.My second condolences."
2,nope.,"This is as low as I have ever rated a Bee Gees cd. This cd is definitely not him. I don't even think he would've released this if Maurice was still around. That aside, he did. Please is the only sensible song on this cd which earned him that 2 stars. The rest of the songs are modern style r&b junkies and the 2 remakes are just like, whoa, why?? I'm glad tho that he's still coming out with music, but it didn't work. Too many unkown guests that make it even worse. I'm still a Bee Gee fan forever though. Go get Main Course."
4,Gaining More Insight,"The way this book differs from many other books on people with disabilities is that this book is written in the unfiltered voice of the the two men who have down syndrome. This really makes a difference because in this way readers more connected to the characters and their cause. This a good read for anybody who wants to broaden their views on people with disabilities. Not many of us have the chance to interact first hand with people with disabilities, but it's a fact that they are a part of our communities, and reading this book is a good way to learn more about them. The topics discussed in the book are really thought provoking and shows the readers that people with disabilities don't get enough credit for their abilities. A good book related to this topic is: Riding the Bus with My Sister."
3,Freckles Humbug Play Stool,"This came with the cover and the pillow separate. The pillow had a rip in the seam when I took it out of the box. I had to hand sew it to fix it. Even though the fabric is heavy duty, it appears the seams are not made to last. Should be more sturdy considering it is for kids and is probably meant to be rolled around and played with."
5,Granddaughter's gift.,Books are treasures and I am glad my grandchildren love to read. Since I am house-bound now it's great to be able to purchase on line and have things delivered to my door.
1,Zzzzz...,"i could only read half an hour of this because it's so boring. read, 'WTBIAAFYE' by hennerita mears. it's much better and much clearer."
5,Mash: the novel.,"I, having been a huge m.a.s.h. fan for years, absolutely loved the book ""Mash: A Novel about three Army Doctors. The storys were funny and well written. The connection...the ""Oh, that's why they did that"" sort of moments abou the show were wonderful.The author was consistent in his stories. The characters were all well developed. The story could easily have been longer and the characters developed even more. All in all a great book. It expanded my view of the tv show."
4,Not Free SF Reader,"Black humour, sawbones and bombs.A US army medical unit stationed in Korea has to deal with all the problems that this entails.However, the author here goes the satire/comedy route some of the time to get his point across more effectively.An interesting novel."
1,It came so late I thought they forgot to send it!,Not worthy of any comments!However I still respect Amazon.com its moviemars that that misrepresent Amazon.com! Cherno Ba!
5,Good Entertainment!,Another series that I own all of and wouldn't trade for anything. I grew up with Ma and Pa...not to mention half-pint!
5,Little House on the Prairie Movie Set,"I thoughly enjoyed these movies, if your a Little House Fan and havnt seen these, THEY ARE A MUST SEE. Keep a box of tissues free."
5,Decemberists' best cd yet!,"I have listened to the Decemberists for about 1 1/2 years now. I bought the Picaresque cd for the ""The Mariner's Revenge Song"" song. It took some time to get used to Colin Meloy's vocals, but he has a way of bringing you into the story of each song. I bought The Crane Wife when it came out, and I was completely blown away by how much the band has progressed musically. It prompted me to buy all of the Decemberists' cds and I love each and every one of them. I highly recommend this cd for anyone who loves music from indie rock to folk to country. It really does have mass appeal, in a rather unusual way."
2,I can't believe so many people love listening to this guy whine.,"Colin Malloy's ""signature voice"" is an incredibly annoying whine. The songwriting is quite nice at times, but just plain silly and campy at others. One gets the impression that the band considers angst an emotion that one should strive to feel. I guess that's great if you're a teenager -- otherwise, not so much."
2,unlistenable,"Bought based on a Clip on NPR - sadly the body of the work did not live up.just boring, when not annoying. sory."
3,Erratic and only partially successful,"The Crane Wife is an erratic production. Some of the numbers work well; some don't. The title song, ""The Crane Wife,* is bloated and too long. The Decemberists' two best albums still remain Picaresque and Castaways & Cutouts."
5,"Never has there been a more perfect CD, ever!","From the moment I heard the first song on the this CD, ""Western Stars"", I was hooked on K.D. Lang. Every song on this CD is a wonderful mix of a little parts western & blues. Just listen to her rendition of ""Busy Being Blue"" if you don't believe me. If you are a Patsy Kline fan, then you will definantly enjoy ""Don't Let The Stars Get In Your Eyes"". Well worth the price that Amazon is asking for."
2,Dreary history!,"This book is filled with a myriad of the strangest named places (often unpronouncable and given two, or three, different regional alternatives), enough historical dates to utterly confuse, peoples, tribes, etc. & a cast of characters larger than any epic. it is a totally confusing work that surely can only be enjoyed by a expert in this field.I am amazed that none of the other reviewers here thought fit to make the point that this book is for the serious student of history. No complaints about the expertise of the author, this is a solid, extremely well researched, history text book. I repeat... a textbook.Warning: if you are reading for enjoyment then please dwell no longer in these pages!"
4,Satan Is Alive And Well And Possessing Bikers In Texas...,"HARD RIDE TO HELL is a throwback / tribute film that combines elements from THE HILLS HAVE EYES and several devil films from the 60s-80s, such as THE DEVIL'S RAIN, BROTHERHOOD OF SATAN, and RACE WITH THE DEVIL. Add in bikers, a Steven Seagal-type hero, and the coming antichrist, and you've pretty much got it. HRTH is loaded w/ mumbo-jumbo and hokum, but manages to retain it's fun factor. I watched it mostly because Katherine Isabelle (GINGER SNAPS 1-3) and Miguel Ferrer (THE STAND, NIGHT FLYER) were in it. However, I wound up liking the whole bloody thing..."
1,Worthless piece of crap,"It won't allow me to give negative stars, or I would. This book goes through a useful page and a half telling you how the computerized GMAT testing works and how different it is from paper tests, then proceeds to give you five paper tests. What sort of moron publishes a book that announces its own uselessness in the first chapter?This book is a worthless piece of crap. Don't buy it. Your money is better spent twisting the bills into rolls and setting them on fire. You have a better chance of improving your score by paying $30 to an illiterate homeless person to take the test for you.I am in the process of contacting Barron's to get my money back."
1,authors are of 4th tier business school faculties,"Given my solid background in Mathematics,I rarely make mistake when dealing with it. Kaplan's quantitative section even failed to meet my expectation of "" real math thing"" problems. Surprisingly, I made some errors in this book's math section. No doubt, I'd suggest the authors of this book get some serious math concepts since their math skills are severely rusty.For non-native english speakers, you wouldn't make a good use of this book's verbal section. You'd be going nowhere! Get the verbal sections from Kaplan and Priceton Review instead!You need clues and hints to tackle Gmat verbal. This book does not give you any!One good thing about this book is that this book is worth it, in the sense that it helps you to meet GMAT requirement from 4th tier Business schools."
1,utter and complete garbage,"The questions in this book use some warped bizarre logic with no basis in reality (or the real test). I found myself feeling incredibly stupid because I wasn't getting answers correct and for the life of me, couldn't understand why.The tips offered by this book are useless as well, and don't correlate specifically to the test (ie - a (lame) general overview on logic is given instead of how to solve the GMAT logic questions).Use the ETS book (The Official Guide for Gmat Review) and the Princeton Review book instead.The night before my GMAT the power went out and I accidently burned this book when one of candles burned too low... this was too good a fate for this book."
3,"In combination with Official Review GMAT book, not that bad","I recently started the study for the GMAT and initially I bought the GMAT review book from Barron's, 12th edition. Even though the passages are sometimes too long and too outdated, the review sections of each type of question I have found very helpfull. Together with the Official Review GMAT book I believe I will have a good change to succeed in the test. Also, I just got some software exercises which really should help me master the test."
2,Disappointed ... bad investment,The software is nothing like a real thing. I agree with the previous reader - you have to scroll these poor 5 lines and you waste your time on this scrolling exercise.Many of us students are looking for more practice tests from the CD (test like conditions) - whereas here we have been given just one test and the software keeps crashing!!!I would not recommend this product for GMAT preparation.
1,Misleading publication,"For some reason this magazine has been shipped from South Africa and contains South African entertainment, articles, stores etc....not what I was expecting at all!No where did I see it mentioned that it would be a South African publication - waste of $118!!!!"
2,"Shows promise, but not quite there yet.","As this was recommended along with Barbara Hambly's latest, I decided to give ""Dead March"" a go. Unfortunately, it can't help but suffer in comparison with ""Wet Grave."" Several things in the book struck me as being underdeveloped, and I think the main fault was the characterization. Too much information about the characters is given in expository chunks; rather than letting us discover who these people are through their actions and their conversation, we're simply told what their attitudes and personalities are. The story would have been much more effective if they'd been allowed to reveal themselves. The premise itself is fascinating and seldom-seen, but the presentation of the author's ideas would have benefitted from some more subtlety."
2,"Been there, done that","With Dead March, Ann McMillan has achieved little more than changing the setting of an old story. The theme of the ""resurrection man"" has been around since the middle of the 19th century when Burke and O'Hare ran their ring in Edinburgh, Scotland. Dead March does contain snippets of period detail, but the characters, including protagonist Narcissa Powers, a salt-of-the-earth wise woman, and a charming but corrupt Southern doctor, are formulaic. As for plot, it's all too predictable - proving that certain medical school officials are sanctioning murder in order to acquire cadavers for teaching. Unless this book will serve as your introduction to this topic, there is no mystery, no suspense, no surprises. Ho hum."
3,Engaging yet weakened by a soft touch to the slave issue.,"I enjoyed this book,found it inventive and engaging. However, I feel the author allowed her 1998 sensibilities to get in the way of a clear and powerful portrait of this era. Once again the realities of the antebellam south have been glossed and ""genteeled down"". The parlor room 'slavery issue' conversations were far more polite than would have been possible if there were truly abolishonist types present. The motivation for the 'resurrection', central to the story, would much more logically have been racism.Removing the darky from the white cemetary for the honor of the family buried there would have made much more sense than the meekly offered excuse given. Surely someone in the capital of the confederacy was a champion for slavery...besides the 'bad' guy. These were complex and contridicted people, I'd love to see more of that in the sequel. But,then what could be left of this story to tell?"
4,PLEASED,I LIKE THE CD I HAD BEEN SEARCHING FOR THIS FOR A LONG TIME AND WAS HAPPY TO FIND IT ON AMAZON. I WOULD CERTAINLY BUY MORE ITEMS FROM YOU. CATHERINE M
2,A little too hokey pokey and sing song for my taste,"A little too hokey pokey and sing song for my taste. I think that the group just basically rested on their individual laurels as performing artists. If you listen to the words of most of the songs it sounds like they just went into the studio to record without having any forethought. I would think that recording artists of this caliber would be able to to at least sound like just didn't drop into the studio just to jam and produce whatever. It sounds disjointed, like they are not connected to each other musically. Overall, rather disapointing after you get over the initial excitement of the combination of the artists. Not a CD that makes me want to listen to it again and again,how about you?"
5,One for the records,"When a lineup like Roy Orbison, George Harrison, Bob Dylan, Tom Petty, and Jeff Lynne get together, one would expect something amazing, and on Vol. 1, it is so much more than that. To me, this album is better than any of these guys solo work by far. This one is constantly in my cd player, and to me is the best rock and roll album of all time. My personal favorite song is End of the Line, but the other songs on here are not even close to being worse. If you find this anywhere, pick it up because its been out of print and is getting harder to find."
5,superstars of the 20th century,"This is such a grand collaberation from some of the greatest songwriters ever. ""She's My Baby"" should have been a top ten hit. And listen to the soulful piece by Roy Orbison that has as much power as ""Pretty Woman"" and you'll know this is a must have for any music collector."
5,Grow Younger & Enjoy,"Don't expect any commercialized garbage..This is a lay back enjoyable, somewhat thought provoking fun time music by guys that haven't forgot what it's like to have fun. Keep it simple, grow young and enjoy.."
4,nice,"I bought this as a gift and they loved it. I don't know the music but based on their reaction, it's great!"
5,Great,"Execellent! A band with legends, which I would call a real supergroup, the songs are written really good and it just doesn't get any better."
3,"Good movie, but book could use an update","I know that talk about updating classic books is taboo, but a rewrite of this would be wonderful. The language of the book is extreamly dated. Sayings and wordings are very hard for a child to understand, because there is not enough understanding of the time period in this day and age. Kids would realy enjoy this book if it was rewritten in more modern wording. I can clearly see why it was an acclaimed book for many years after it wes first published. There is a film made from the book and My kids did love that(which is why I wanted to read them the book)."
5,What an addiction !,"The Lightning Seeds are quite addictive and this cd is the best example to prove it ! I guess it is hard not to enjoy songs like ""Like You Do"", ""Sugar Coated Iceberg"", ""Fingers & Thumbs"" and ""Ready Or Not""...This album is memorable only for the fact that there is simply no dull moment on it...The music could be described as being ""sweet and melodic pop-rock for intellectuals""...A must-have for fans of the British pop scene...Believe me, buy this album and you'll soon find yourself wanting more..."
5,Delightful genius!,"One of the great American operas of the late twentieth century, Schiff's 'Gimpel the Fool' is a tour de force. Schiff's delightful musical vocabulary includes hefty doses of Stravinskian bite, Mahler-distilled klezmer music, a hint of Elliott Carter (Schiff's teacher) and an unfailing American lyricism and theatrical sense."
1,Disappointed,"I ordered this product on November 28, for my son for Christmas. It never arrived and this person would not even respond to my E-Mails. On December 24, I had to find another gift so he would have a gift at Christmas.I will NEVER order anything from them again."
2,Overpriced,This is a good program and method overall but the price is just too high in my opinion. I would recomend taking a look at Spanish Now by Transparent Language which is also has a good method and a very good program but much more affordable.
1,too much,"Too much money for too little results. There is no grounding done up front so you have no idea how to string together the words you are learning. I had to refer to a translation service to understand what the often repeated articles were. If there were a key you could hit to get a english translation it would allow you to get a better idea of how all the Spanish words work together.It gets boring really fast too!Don't waste your money, try Destinos off the internet for FREE."
5,Musical genius.,"This remains the greatest jazz vocal album I've ever heard, even after ten years and many inspired imitators. Contains many of Take 6's greatest arrangements and performances. I've owned this album for five years now and am growing convinced that it is a work of timeless genius."
2,take 6,"I listended to a snipet of this cd on Amazon, 'A Quiet Place'.Sometimes those samples don't give you the complete picture.In other words you need more than two seconds to judge a song.I did'nt care for this cd as a whole. It sounds dated, thoughI am a big fan of Take 6. I especially like their sessions withStevie Wonder, but this cd comes across as just another one ofthoses Boy Bands from the 80s and 90s."
1,Maybe for a dorm or small apartment,"Bought this to do my hardwood and ceramic floors, you have to completly clean the filter each time, I'd use my air compressor, a true hassle, everything gets jammed right at the inlet as well, both wheels fell off within a year. Spend a few bucks more on something else"
3,"great suction, BUT","I give this vacuum 5 stars for its suction, BUT...if you are looking for a light weight vacuum,,,,it's not the 11 lbs i think they state. I was looking for a lightweight (because of stairs),,it's not lightweight. AND I've had bagless vacuums before but because this vacuum DOES really have great suction,,,you really do have to empty the cylinder everytime you vacuum and then its stupid not to , at that time, to clean the filter also. And as a previous reviewer said,,,DO IT OUTSIDE,,,,It is dusty/messy. It's almost a job after the vacuum job u just did. But it does clean exceptionally well...And if anyone is curious,,,it is loud. Also, the hose should be double the length that it is. It's way too short. I am a vacuum look for queen. I want it all , including price.,This vacuum is work, (the clean up,) Its not 11 lbs. It's noisy,,,BUT, it DOES clean well."
3,Great vacuum for a great price.,"We have 3 floors in our home and I can take this vacuum anywhere. It does the carpeted steps, the floors (bare and carpeted), I even use the attachments for dusting. This bagless vacuum is very easy to empty and clean. I just wish the cord was a few feet longer, that's it."
1,Doesn't matter what it does if it doesn't arrive in one piece,"This is one of a dozen items I ordered from Amazon as gifts. It was shipped from Amazon in the retail display box via UPS so there was no mistaking what it was when it arrived. Additionally, it had a foot shaped hole in the box and parts of the product were damaged or missing. No protective carton, no packaging material. Returned and will no be reordered. The same day a ceramic utensil holder arrived in a carton with no top and bottom packing, just one plastic air bag on one side and the ceramic holder in about a dozen parts. Ten minutes to order, 4 days to deliver, a month to process a return. I gave this one star because damage in shipment without a protective carton is expected."
1,Wheels Fall Off,"Other reviews have mentioned this, but I wanted to add my 1 start to theirs. The wheels fall off andthere is no way to get them to stay on. Can't vacuum without wheels!! I won't ever buy one again."
1,short lived,I bought this vacuum about 8 months ago. I wanted something cheap and lightweight because I only have one area rug in my house and the rest is hardwoods that I sweep. It died on me today. It just makes a very sad blown motor noise. It only got used for about 5 minutes twice a week for 8 months. Very short lived.
3,"Have buring rubber smell when it's running,","It has been used at least 4 hours total so far. But, it still makes strong rubber burning smell. Other than that, It works fine. The handle is really cool and easy to grep."
4,Good little lightweight vacuum,"I hate to clean and especially to lug around a heavy vacuum. I bought a Dyson, but it was just too big and bulky for my little place. This vacuum is small, the handle goes down for storage and it does a good job picking up big and small pieces. I like the bagless option, but the canister does fill up pretty quickly. I wouldn't recommend if you do a lot of vacuuming, but for light household use it's great. Very lightweight, which is great for my back. I also like the attachments which work well for cleaning the couches. Overall, glad I bought this."
4,Good Product,I had this product before and it broke down after 3 years. I bought it again as its really powerful and cheap. Hopefully this one does not breaks down
1,get the LP instead,"track down the LP of this one as there is about 10 minutes missing in the CD.... I am so sad & I wished for better, the LP is 4 stars"
5,Charismatic underdog confronts injustice and wins your heart,"Within the first few pages you are caught up wanting to know more about this wonderful odd-ball character Flap and what will happen as he, a Native American, tries to reclaim the land where Phoenix, Arizona now stands for his people according to a long lost, but firm agreement. I have read this book five times and now that I see it is being republished, I just started it again."
1,This product had no effect on my dogs.,"I used this product on our Chihuahua, Greyhounds & German Shepherd and it had absolutely no effect on any of them.No where in the description on Amazon does it say the product is made by K-II Enterprises which sells it under the brand name Dazzer II. It's only when I received it and saw the K-II name on the box that I realized it is the same as K-II's own ultrasonic trainer. I own a Dazzer II and it also has no affect on the dogs.K-Ii Enterprises Pet-Agree Dog Training Aid Ultrasonic"
3,Want Want Regular Crackers,"These are OK but the Big Shelley Snowy crackers are much better. These seem quite salty to me,hence I don't like them nearly as well as others."
3,Worth the money compared to the high priced ones,"I bought this because I needed something not to expensive since I could not put my speakers on the wall next to the TV in the corner. The ease of installation was nice, very quick to setup. I had some problems working my 16 gauge wire in there but eventually got it. The reason I gave it three stars is because the plastic tightners to attach the speakers seem like they may break and are cheap, also they do not hold my speaker that tight, it is a 2lb. speaker. They also seem to tilt forward somewhat which is ok. The rest of the product is made of metal and pretty heavy so it has not problems staying on the carpet. I wish there was a slot for the speaker wire to fit through so the stand itself does not just lay on the wire, seems to add to the tilting problem. Overall this was a good buy for about 1/4 or even 1/7 of the price of the recommended Onkyo ones. These speakers were for the Onkyo S3300 system."
4,Works great with my mb8000 satellites,"For such a great price, I'm amazed how sturdy these stands are. They work great with my speakers (pinnacle s fit 150s) and work well with my decor. My only gripe was trying to thread 12 gauge speaker wire through the stands. Almost next to impossible. Otherwise, this would be a 5 star review."
1,You get what you pay for,I just bought these speaker stands. I have TINY Sony rear speakers so the fact that the stability didn't seem too great wasn't an issue. Once I put them together the piece that holds the two poles together worked on one but not the other. The connector itself is cheap plastic while the rest of the stand is made of decent quality metal. Didn't make much sense. The stand that DID work wouldn't allow height adjustment but did hold the speaker up at base height which is pretty low.Pro:Cheap as far as priceCons:Connectors are cheap plasticHeight is pretty low even if you can a connector that works
4,Not Bad for the price,"An adequate stand for very small satellite speakers. I used them to locate the middle speakers on a modest 7.1 surround sound system in a carpeted room. They would not have held the fronts. Reasonably well-made and stable enough (or sufficiently uninteresting) that our cats have not knocked them over (yet!). ""Universal"" mounting hardware did not fit my speakers. I could have risked drilling into the speaker enclosure to use the HW provided, but chose instead to make trip to the HW store. This should not have been necessary. All-in-all, good enough for my use."
2,"Great Light, Cheap Clamp","I could not say more good things about the light itself, especially for the price. But the clamp is so cheap, it renders the light useless. I guess proper engineering takes money. If the light wasn't so good, I'd give it a ""1"" star because of the clamp."
3,"Bright, but not durable","This light is bright, and appears to be pretty easy going on the batteries. The main issue is the construction.The light comes with 2 parts, the light itself, and a clamp that you attach to your handlebars/frame. The clamp features two grooves along the side and a spring mounted tab to prevent the light from sliding back. The light itself contains two long tabs that slide into the clamp, and a square hole that the tab holds onto.The main issue was a few days ago I got tangled in my clips and fell over (silly error, I know). After that I realized that one of the tabs on the light itself had snapped clear. The result is that it holds on smooth concrete, but rough enough ground shakes it free from my bike. This is a shame, because up until this point I loved this light."
1,Seriously worst bike mount ever,It cannot be this hard to make a good bike mount. I've gone through three headlights all dead for various reasons and I chose this because I just needed something simple for a lighted street at night.This bike mount is the worst piece of crap I've ever witnessed in my life. I wonder if this company even owns a bike to test them out before putting this on the market? While typing the past three sentences my headlight has slipped and started pointing down. The bike is not moving and I wasn't touching it. It's crap.Avoid.
5,Great Light!,"I am very pleased with my bike beamer! The only problem is that it interferes with my speedometer when the light is on constant blink. Otherwise, it is great. The only solution, replace with a Planet Bike speedometer which I will do at some point."
4,Good product,"Works well, really good solid beam of light that comes out in a perfect circle. The only thing I dont like is that you have to attach a component to your bike that stays on the bike even when you take the light off. I would prefer something that I can take off both the mounting and the light, but then again , this does make for very easy mounting."
5,Great Light,"I bought this light a few months ago, and I couldn't be more pleased with it. Construction is compact but very durable, and the lights are bright. I have two bikes, and I was happy with the ease of mounting & removing this from the handlebars. I would definitely recommend!"
5,Worth Every Penny,"This is a great product. It has saved me from being hit several times, and I've only had it two weeks. It was easy to install, and is very, very bright. It is worth the purchase price!"
5,great all around light,"This light is much better than what I expected. Ditto everyone's comments on the quality of the beam. I don't normally use the flash mode. However, I recently got caught in a torrential downpour at night. I was already wet, so why not keep riding? I put the light in flashing mode and it was great. The light is water tight even after twenty minutes in the hard rain. I wouldn't go so far as saying the mounting bracket is horrible, it just isn't the best design. Yes, it is adjustable, but only to varying degrees. You can tweak with the adjustments to it, but it clearly just doesn't fit some bars. I tried for quite awhile to get it to fit my cruiser handlebars. I finally resorted to wrapping the handlebar with tape and then mounting it. I still kept it slighty loose so I can quickly adjust the light upward a bit for better visibility in flashing mode. Quite simply, this is a great light."
2,Looking for something better,I have had this for a couple of months. The light is not that bright at night. The rubber strip on the mounting bracket has deteriorated. The light now does not lock into the mount anymore and keeps falling off. I finally lost it tonight for good.
2,Water Damage,"The light died soon after the first time I had to ride in a light rain. Water penetrated the battery housing. I would not recommend the product, but if you do buy it, consider wrapping it, or maybe turning it off when the rain comes."
3,"Bright light, stuck switch",Got 2 of these for kids cycles and they fit and worked great initially.For some reason the switch on both of them got stuck; one in the off and one in the blinking position.Guess I wasted my money.
3,Good light but bad bracket,"Received the product quickly and in good shape. I am pleased with the light, however the mounting bracket is no good. The mount does not grip as flush to the bike as I like. So far it has stayed in place but have not ridden on any really bumpy roads yet. I also had to add a couple of layers of scotch tape to the base of the bracket because the light would not sit tight enough on the bracket and it would rattle the entire bike ride. After the I made the modifications it seems to work fine, however I should not have had to make them."
5,Great product!,"I have a GT avalanche 3.0. Fits perfectly well on the handle bar and stays tight. It has a very adjustable size system on the mounting system. I do not know the maximum but it fit perfectly for me. The light is very bright a provides a perfect circle in front of you. I don't know about the battery life as i've only owned the product for only a week. There's two different on settings, 1) fast blinking 2) constant on. I'm sure i'll put the light to more use when day light savings is over. This light will definitely light up the road in front of you at night and you will be very noticeable to oncoming cars. Hope this helps!"
2,disappointed,I was disappointed when I received this book. The recipes seem to be geared more toward the older toddler and less toward the baby beginning to eat table foods. I really had hoped that there would have been more ideas/recipes for the younger eater. The book is okay but I certainly wouldn't recommend it to anyone.
2,Not impressed,"I'm not impressed with the organization and flow of this book. Perhaps it's just not what I was looking for. It just doesn't seem to flow to me as an ""idiot's guide""...and that's exactly what I needed as a first time mom looking for a good, concise source of feeding and nutrition information for introducing solid foods to an infant."
4,Appealing album from much-missed band,"The follow-up to Cupid & Psyche didn't do too well on the pop charts, which is a shame because it's a fine album. Although some tracks suffer from being overly similar, the best cuts are wonderful, especially the haunting ""Oh Patti,"" which wonderfully displays Green Gartside's lyrical gifts and unique voice. Hopefully, this frail, brainy pop genius will release another album eventually."
5,This is a must have book!,"Usually I cook recipes much more complicated than the ones in this book, but these recipes are all great. They are tasty and the vast majority are quick and easy to prepare. I have given this book to many people as a gift and they all love it. A few friends got rid of all their falling apart pieces of paper that contained these recipes. Most people will recognize a lot of the recipes because they are classic ones that many Americans grew up on such as Campbell's Green Bean Bake, Red Velvet Cake, Party Cheese Balls, California Dip and so on. All these classic recipes are found in this one book which you will refer to again and again."
4,Perfect!,I got this for my very clumsy husband and it's great! Very durable and has lasted a lot of abuse!
2,Unreliable and requires special antenna,"I purchased this CB radio as a replacement for another Cobra CB that had failed. Only when I read the instruction manual did I find out that this radio requires a special antenna to get good reception on both the CB and weather channels. I elected to use my standard antenna, and CB section of the radio appeared to function very well for a short time. The radio failed after 6 to 8 hours of service. I checked the condition and SWR of the antenna circuit both before and after installing the radio and found no problem with them."
4,Silly Fun with a dash of Heart,"I give it 5 for originalty and a 4 for entertainment value. Great role by Michael Madsen as a mafia-like vampires who plays the lead character's ""Sponsor."" There are titles cards that introduce the ""12 Steps"" of being in Vampires Anonymous -- very funny."
4,Great Videos!!!,"First off, Those who wrote reviews expecting to see HD or LCD quality in these videos, gimme a break please!! These are just how I remember watching them on TV every weekend when I was a kid. Juaques Cousteau is and will forever be the king of the oceans and seas. I loved watching these videos, took me back in time. I did NOT expect to see fully remastered picture quality....There's no such advertisement nor do they mislead anyone into thinking otherwise. So if you're a pampered baby and must have HD quality without whining then don't buy these videos, but if you can overlook that and have a lust for marine biology and oceanography then these are for you."
2,Can things get any worse?,"This has less than nothing to do with I Spy which was cool and clever. Even Roger Ebert will have a tough time giving this a thumbs up.Two stars because Eddie manages to get off some funny lines while Owen Wilson sleepwalks--and who can blame him.What next, Hollywood? The Man From U.N.C.L.E. starring Adam Sandler?"
4,Good - Forget the Critics,"Short and sweet - the critics lambasted this movie, and it stiffed at the box office. Forget all that - this is a FUNNY movie!! You can't put Owen Wilson and Eddie Murphy together and not get funny...it just can't happen.It ain't great, but it is good and funny and well worth it - I laughed out loud. The dialogue between the two is, at times, priceless."
1,Crap.,"I wish I could rate this movie 0 stars, because it was a total bomb. Eddie Murphy didn't even seem to be acting. Pluto Nash was 10x the movie that this was, and that was also a total waste of my time also. This movie would have best been left on the cutting room floor. Now don't get me wrong, and think I don't like Eddie Murphy. I have enjoyed his comedy ever since I saw ""Beverly Hills Cop"". It's just that this movie falls dead at the starting line. I never like what critics say about most movies, but the were right on with this one. I beg and plead with you one and all, just say ""NO"" to this movie."
2,A Classic PratFall! (Right on its' FACE!),"From its' role reversal to its' satirical attempt at following the classic lines of the original T.V. show, ""I Spy"" misses the mark worse than a novice trainee on the firing line on range at Quantico. As Robin Williams once said of ""Popeye"", ""This one didn't do ANYONE any good!""As a comeback try for Murphy, or a career boost for the rest of the crew, time, money, and effort would have been best spent elsewhere. This one was almost as big a flop as ""Pluto Nash""; as a Died-In-The-Wool ""I Spy"" Fan, I was so insulted, I almost walked out, even though I'd only paid for the matinee. About the only thing that saved this one is the CGI work."
5,The best album ever!,"its a must buy! listening 2 it will make u fall in love instantly with the group. ""romeo and juliet"" is just amazing and so are the others. although a few songs like ""telegraph road"" and ""where do u think u r going"" are not present but the rest of the tracks are pretty cool. if u like rock then u must pick it up. the songs will hold u entranced and when u listen 2 u ust can't listen 2 it as background music. it'll hold your concentration. In short: AMAZING"
1,Censored lyrics and missing essentials,"Dire Straits were a very talented band who made some decent music. Unfortunately this collection leaves off two of their strongest songs, ""Skateaway"" and ""Industrial Disease"" (three, if you count ""Solid Rock"") - and even more outrageous is the editing out the second verse of ""Money For Nothing."" No warning on the label? Big-time cave-in to the evil forces of political correctness!A better introduction to the band would be to just buy the album ""Making Movies."" They haven't made a decent greatest hits collection for Dire Straits, and they probably never will :("
2,Disappointing - too many edits spoil the songs,"Firstly in response to the editorial - 'Communique' is not a dismal record by any means! It may not have fared as well as other DS albums and had no hits so to speak, but it was a good album!Its a shame that instead of releasing a 2 CD compilation, instead cramming 16 songs onto one CD meant editing so many great songs - 'Money for Nothing', 'Brothers In Arms', et al. More over, this collection has too many annoying live renditions of songs which were superior in their original studio format - 'Love Over Gold' in particular. With the new 'Private Investigations' CD out now (in single and also double CD form), check that one out, or stick to the original studio albums, this is not a showcase of DS at their best. Several tracks including the superb 'Telegraph Road' areis also missing from this collection."
3,Not A Bad Intro But Not Great As A Genuine Portrayal,"A few points I will list here to rank this CD's quality. First, editing of major tracks (already noted by previous reviewers). Second, the exclusion of three important songs: Skateaway, Expresso Love and Industrial Disease. Finally, an upscale remark. This `Very Best Of' indeed contains the band's prime hits no matter what mode they be arranged. So, to keep this review short but honest if you love Dire Straits why not purchase this CD for your collection. However, if you love your music collection more than Dire Straits best consider another CD and enjoy without any regrets."
2,Forget the Best Of get the real thing,"If all you know of Dire Straits is their ""Best Of"" you are really missing the best of Dire Straits and the incredible songwriting and guitar of Mark Knopfler. Avoid this mainstream offering and get the albums. Start off with Making Movies, their self titled Dire Straits and/or the live album Alchemy."
1,Bandana's are uncomfy.,"I purchased (6) of the 27"" x 27"" Tigers stripes and a Digital Camo bandanas, and the material is like wearing canvas. I even washed them 3 times and used tons of fabric softener to no avail..I emailed the company to find out what material that they were made from and they claimed they are 100% cotton, which i know they're not..Its to bad because i love the tiger striped ones alot because of the print..I just wished the company would tell the truth to there customers."
2,"Cheap, Cheap","I have no comments on the actual substance of this book. The contents of the Scofield Bible are well-known enough to anyone searching for it, and the 1917 version appears to have stood the test of time.The makers of this version, however, have not done users any favors in its assembly. This feels about like a bible you'd find in a drawer in a cheap motel. The cover is hard but very light, the binding is cheap, and mine came with a number of deformities, including but not limited to folded pages, off-center pages, pages whose corners were actually sewn into the spine, and poorly cut pages. The pages themselves are also thin, but I expect this from any bible, so no harm there.If I had it to do over again, I'd definitely look to pay a little more for a more solid version of this book. For my intents and purposes, I don't dislike this enough to return it, but if it were going to be seeing more regular use at my house, I'd certainly be looking to swap it out for something more permanent."
3,"NICE PRODUCT, EXCELLENT BIBLE",It is a nice finish but the corner of the bible bend very quickly. The bible is excellent for a serious student of the bible.
4,Home network boost,"I have a two-story house and the wireless reception on the top floor was always a little poor. I even have the router up high on the main floor. Heard and read about the antenna kit, and thought for the price it would be worth a try. After installing, I found that even my TiVo on the upper floor had better reception by about 20-30%. This was the big boost I needed for both notebook computers and the TiVo equipment on that floor."
1,Very disapointing,"I live in a ranch house with thin walls (built in the 60s) and was hoping to boost my signal beyond the kitchen into the family room (no wall between the 2 rooms). Instead the bar level remained exactly the same.I understand that the walls between the room where the router is (relocation is not an option) could cause some blockage, but after reading the reviews and linksys own materials, I was led to believe that there would be at least some improvement. Instead, things remained as was. Heck, there wasn't even improvement within the room, with my wifi satellite radio slipping from 3 bars to 2 bars while we were still in the room."
2,No signal strength improvement,"I see no change in the signal strength using the high gain antennas. There may be better transmission quality, but the meter on my computer reads 18 Mbps transfer rate regardless of whether I use the original antennas or the high gain antennas. I have no way to assess if there are fewer dropped packets."
3,Linksys High Gain Antennas - Not a panacea,"I replaced a Netgear single-antenna 802.11b/g wireless gateway with a Linksys model primarily to get the option for replaceable antennas and to try to increase the coverage in my house. Prices had come down so much that it was reasonable to make a speculative investment -- I paid as much for the antenna kit as for the gateway. To my chagrin, I notice no difference at all. Now, I have to insert a caveat that our cable comes into our house in the worst possible place -- the basement -- and wireless coverage has always been spotty; we wired our house for phone / data / TV, so that wasn't a problem until we went wireless. I also have not yet had the chance to try the new setup with other than my Dell Latitude D600 with built-in wireless network: things may work better with an external card. All I can say at this point is that the antennas do not seem to have made a difference."
1,Worth it?? I think Not!,"I noticed no improvement after adding the high gain antenna kit. I would advise not purchasing this, instead opt for the amp that is avaliable."
3,Little improvement,"I purchase the product and although some improvement was noticed, my expectation was not achieved. I have a router installed in my bedroom and the wireless signal in my living room was merely poor/low. After I installed the signal is now between low/good. Both rooms are on the same floor, so omnidirectional should work fine.In summary: I suggest changing signal channel, changing phone handset frequency and moving away objects that can jeopardize signal quality, such as fish tanks and microwave. After you've done it all, then you should consider buying these antennas."
1,stay away from pvc poles,I bought this because it was free shipping with PRIME. We went to set it up for the first time and had the plastic poles split where they have the little push button connector. They aren't very sturdy. I will know the next time to buy steel poles.
1,SMALL SIZE INEFFECTIVE RESULTS,I ordered this for my wife. I knew is was only 4 oz but it seemed even smaller. For the price it is not worth it. My wife liked the smell but the results were horrible. Would never purshase this again.
3,Thought this was the one...,"How nave I was! Nice card stock, no USG copyright on it. Very seventies. You're gonna love it or hate it."
4,I read this as a child and am thrilled to find it again,"Recently, my husband and I were discussing favorite books we read as children. I told him about this wonderful book I just loved that took place on Krakatoa. For the life of me I couldn't remember the author or title. I'm just thrilled that I could use your search engine to find this wonderful book so I can purchase it for my children. It pushes the imagination and challenges children to put themselves in a similar situation and ask themselves ""what would I do?"" I'd recommend this book to any parent looking for worthwhile reading material for their child."
4,Very Adventerous book!,"The Twenty One BalloonsIn the book, The Twenty One Balloons by William Pene du Bois a professor crashes on the island of Krakatoa in a hot-air-balloon then to discover hidden treasures on the island. I think this book was very exiting and interesting and I would read it again if I could.A professor named William Waterman Sherman sets off on a journey around the world in a hot-air-balloon from San Francisco. He then crash-lands on the island of Krakatoa then discovering a huge diamond mine and villagers hidden on the island.I very much enjoyed the book because I love adventure books and there is always something new to find on the island. And the only thing that was a little boring was the beginning but once he landed on the island it got much more exiting. I would recommend this book to anybody looking for an exciting and adventurous bookThis was a really great book and I highly recommend it to anybody who wants to read it."
4,Aerosoles Boot,"I purchased these boots hoping they would fit and not hurt my feet. I have arthritis in one foot and can hardly wear shoes because of the pain.These boots fit very well, look great, and I can wear them longer than any shoe I have had in the past year!! I love them."
5,WOOWWW!,"If everyone else in the reviews didn't convince you to buy this album, you're crazy. I got this at The Exclusive Company yesterday. I hadn't ever heard of them, but the guy who works there told me since I like Rise Against, Green Day, and all the classic ""the"" bands there is no excuse not to buy it for 6.00. It blew me away! BUY IT! 'Lookout' or whoever produces it is going out of business. Soon you won't be able to buy it on cd."
3,Time is Money,"This very short book aims to explain Gibson's ideas about risk and return in investing. Essentially he suggests that investors can afford to put more money into equities if their ""time horizon"" is a long one.He has extracted a number of the earlier chapters from his longer work "" Asset Allocation"". These chapters focus on the time horizon argument.There is no new material in the book.The book is a good one for the novice investor, worried about the short term volatility of the market. It would be an ideal book for financial advisers to give to intelligent clients nervous about the market."
1,Didn't like it,Not even a little bit. I found it mindless and juvenile.Maybe it's because I haven't been to New Orleans.
1,Not for Sony Ericsson W300i,"The charger was purchased to charge my W300i cell phone. It's cord did not seat well with the phone, therefore, could not charge it."
4,...,Charger works good enough for the cheap price. Fits my w810i although i have to do a bit of wiggling to get it to start charging.
3,excellent example of alternative carribbean music,"This type of music, actually considered carribbean funk, is different from what most would consider true carribbean music. It is however, a fun, happy brand of music caught somewhere in between reggae and soca. If one is looking for meaningful lyrics and a point to the songs on a recording, this is probably not something for them, but it is a some of the best carribbean party music around. Just a little note, the song Island Girl was actually featured in the movie Weekend at Bernie's 2."
4,Little bit bigger would be nice,I bought this when going on a trip for a long weekend. It is a good size for a long weekend (3 pairs of clothes or so plus all your toiletries. The bag that comes out of the side to help make the bag bigger really only makes it awkward to carry. It does work for soft thing. Decent bag otherwise
3,CHev,This bag is very nice and looks like the picture except that I ordered a red bag and it was shipped to me in orange.
5,Best Movie Of All Time,This is a must see for any movie fan. I have seen the movie over 100 times and study it. It is so amazing. Hitchcock was a genius. Words can't describe how excellent this movie is.
4,WE ALL GO A LITTLE MAD SOMETIMES!,The grandfather of slasher horror films.Anthony Perkins delivers a chilling performance as Norman Bates. This film is based on Robert Bloch's 1959 novel.This is really a true classic and should belong to all serious horror fan and film buff's video collection.The remake could never out do this original classic.
5,Psycho...classic Hitchcock...classic scary movie!!,In my personal opinion Psycho is truly one of scariest and suspense filled movies of all time. What more can you ask. A woman accused of stealing 40 thousand dollars...the infamous shower scene...a hotel proprietor gone beserk. It's a classic! Janet Leigh and Anthony Perkins clicked in this 1960 Hitchcock thriller! Believe me once you see it you'll never take a shower again!!
3,"Classic film, bad transfer","While Psycho is one of the greatest films of all time, this dvd does no justice. The transfer is horrible. The film seems darker at some points in the film and it makes it hard to know what is going on. I still enjoyed the film just not the transfer."
4,Loved it!,"The movie is great! Hitchcock is the master of suspense! And Anthony Perkins as Norman Bates gives a fantastic performance. In terms of the quality of the video, I think it was a little slow. A couple of times the video had to stop and reload. But that may just be a problem on my end; I'm not entirely sure."
5,Best Film Ever Made,"Never before - or since - have direction,screenplay,score andcasting converged so perfectly.My favorite scene : Janet Leigh stops car at pedestrian crossingas she is escaping with stolen money and is glared at by her bosscrossing the street(after telling him she would be home sick).Notice how other movies (Pulp Fiction) have used this."
3,"Among Hitchcock's filmography, this is average...","Don't mind me, I am just one of those old time cranks. I've seen perhaps twenty Hitchcock films, and actually saw this one much later, which is ironic since Psycho is often claimed as his most ""famous"" work.This film is all-consumed on sheer suspense, but lacks the more important art of cinema which Hitchcock generally applied in his other works. Even he himself considered this movie a very ""tongue and cheek"" example of his style.I'd recommend the 1948 movie Rope if you're looking for fine Hitchcockian cinema."
5,Pure Cinema,"Its pure Hitchcock and pure cinema..the masters touch.Consider...why did mother ""run"" from the hotel room..( we get to see only 4 seconds) of the ""escape"" ..no one else is there..why run??Hitchcock resorts to the dreaded ""overhead"" shot twice in the film...the first when Balsam is dispatched .....and the next when we are derpived of seeing Mrs. Bates...Pure Cinema..."
3,Use as a reference ONLY!!!,This book is way of track with regard to the actual value of the cars. Use only as a reference guide. Great pictures. Does NOT include ALL 1998 FIRST EDITION series cars.
3,doesn't run on 64 bit OS,I can't tell you how effective it is. I can tell you that it does not run on XP 64 or Vista.
1,Damaged by poor package,"This order is a car cabin air filter which can't be bended.But this package came with serious bend due to pressure.And, no any way to complained to original seller."
4,not for beginners. . .,"This book was very concise, offering excellent reference to all the myriad details to be found in 3dsmax. Unfortunately, I was a first time user and could make almost no sense whatsoever of how to perform or incorporate many of these details. After purchasing an entry level manual however, (how to draw with 3dsmaxr2 in 14 days.) The wealth of information in this book made sense and was now of great value! This book is an excellent reference deserving to be added to your 3dsmax library."
4,Good book.,Great book to read on a lazy summer day at the beach. Very light reading. Romantic and fun book as only Macomber can do!
3,16 Lighthouse Road,"Although 16 Lighthouse flowed and read well, and kept my interest. I just felt it was lacking that mystery, or excitement, or punch to make it an exceptional book to give it a 4 or 5 star rating. I would rate it more a 31/2. This was a story about life and struggles of its characters. I had a hard time with how the character's Grace and Dan's story played out with Dan leaving Grace after 30 some years of marriage. Dan doesn't keep in touch with his daughter's even though the one daughter was pregnant and having a baby, his grandchild. I can understand not seeing or communicating with his wife but not his children. I felt he should have come around to see his daughter when she had the baby. I would have written this story a little differently. I don't want to discouraged anyone from reading it because they may feel differently, just my opinion and still an okay book."
3,Easy reading.,"Easy reading book. Good beach reader. Somewhat predictable, but a feel good book. I loved the ending. Another winner for Macomber."
3,Depends what you are looking for in a book,"This is an ok book, decent storylines, though there are many going on at once and you can kind of forget who the characters are. This is the first I have read from this author and I can't say I loved the writing style. It's kind of stumbling at times or forced or maybe awkward? Definitely overly simplistic. Overall though if you are looking for a very easy quick read that is entertaining and lighthearted, this is nice. I guess that's the best description of the book-it's nice. Nothing earth-shattering but a nice slice of life kind of book."
4,"Old School all the way, bay-bee...","I might be grandpa for saying this, but when I wanna be rocked afresh with swift/smart/smooth rhymes, I go back to the time when Rap was still strong and had no imitators or pretenders to the throne.""Power"" was recorded in two weeks, but it sure doesn't sound like it--some of Ice's classic tracks are right here: ""I'm Your Pusher"", ""High Rollers"", ""Girls LGBNAF"", ""Power"", ""Radio Suckers""... not a weak link on the album with the exception of party number ""The Syndicate"".Later albums ""The Iceberg/Freedom of Speech..."" and ""O.G."" would embody perfection, but this was the REAL Ice at his zenith."
1,Waste of money,"You would expect a lot more from Disney, especially for the price. This software is horrible. You can't change much and is VERY limited in what it can do. Huge dissapointment for my child. Dont waste your money."
5,Blushing in West Chester,"I love this color. Not too pink, not too red, just the right blush color to wear."
4,good color,"The container was much smaller than I thought, however, a little goes a long way. Good color very neuteral ."
2,Lame book,"1. I have bought / read around 5-6 photoshop books.2. I've been a photographer for 20 years, have a lot of traditional darkroom experience, but have been into digital photography for around... 2 yrs.3. Bottomline:a. This book is somewhat difficult to read (not as clear as it can / should be).b. There is way too little practical detail. There's a lot of fluff, but little substance.c. The attached CD-ROM is a joke. Not really helpful.d. I would recommend others to at least consider: blazer / blatner's book (real world photoshop), photoshop artistry, john camp's book (don't know how to spell his last name)."
5,Excellent,"James lives up to his title ""funniest man in America""get a biscuit and sop that up!you can show this dvd to your grandmother and your grandchildren... they will all laugh the same"
3,Tell me you love me,Easy read light storyline good for all. New author will check other books by same or content type themed books
5,Another Exceptional Read,"I will say once again,David Lehman is one of the most facinating writers, poets, and editors that I have ever read. He is the author of The Daily Mirror, a wonderful and well penned selection of poems.I believe his perspective and talent for finding the best poets lies in his experience. Mr.Lehman is a great editor and any reader who chooses to pick up and read this book will be thankful.One can learn so much from the writers and makers of The Best American Poetry books. I also recommend, his most recent book, The Last Avant-Garde: The Making of the New York School of Poets. I give all these books 5 stars!"
2,not worth the money,this toy reels very rough. my 2 year old gets very frustrated trying to play with it and finally just threw it down. fish come apart.
4,A BOY A Ship and A War,Great reading true history by a man who there part of the greatest generation. Thank you for your service Mr. Aldrich.HI
2,Do Not Buy Canadian Blu-Ray!,"As has been reported elsewhere, the blu-ray version of this entertaining and well-done mash-up of fantasy and scifi, Beowulf and Predator-like narratives, has been irresponsibly and irreparably ruined in the transfer offered by Alliance of Canada. Similar to what Alliance did with Se7en, they have cropped the film's original aspect ratio of 2.35:1 down to 1.78:1! Not sure what ""genius"" was behind this decision, but for anyone wanting to see this film in blu-ray, hope the currently financially-challenged Weinstein Group are one day able to offer this film in the US with the transfer it deserves!"
5,"A MUST SEE MOVIE; ""OUTLANDISH & OUTSTANDING"" FOR ALL FANS OR FAMILY TO SEE!","J.C. does it again as the main character, but this time not as the characters in ""Count of Monte Christo"" and ""Passion of the Christ"" which were also two other masterfully done movies by this dynamic actor like Johnny Depp who always brings his ""A-game"" by showing depth to his characters.All I have to say is if you are a fan of historical backdrop movies mixed in with epic drama, love and action that contrast past and future by making them ""clash as titans"" (no not like that other dumb movie but rather metaphorically speaking in contrasting human values, mind and soul), then you will definitely enjoy this movie!!THIS IS A MUST-SEE MOVIE. I still can't believe I and friends never heard of it in theatres due to low marketing and distribution efforts by its producers but then it truly makes this a treasure and great find if you pick it!Enjoy it with the family for the holidays."
4,Outlander,"True Sci-Fi fans will find this tale believable and inspiring...makes one expand ones concept of life in the universe.The acting and story line is above average.The special effects are above average for the time period produced...In fact, while perhaps not up to the current action film standards, the effects merge well with the content of the picture. With a little imagination, this story could easily have been turned into a series worthy of following."
4,Way better then I thought,"I'm a Scifi fan from way back and although,this movie wasn't perfect it was a very good entraining movie. The special effects are good and it has a small but interesting and fitting back-story.worth the money IMHO."
2,Wanted to Like It,"I really really wanted to like this movie after I read the back of the DVD cover. ***SPOILER WARNINGS***But in the end it had way too many flaws and wasn't exciting at all. Here is this guy with unimaginable advanced knowledge and weapondry and he uses it to shoot a tree? They kill a bear and he waits until they are back at the compound to tell them this while the creature goes on killing? He dives back to his ship only to pick up pieces of metal instead of raiding the weapons locker? I just think the movie would have been better by actually incorporating his technology with their cutting weapon capability. The story did not do that, just give him a more powerful sword - woopdi do."
1,Cliche,"I tried to watch this movie. It had an interesting opening sequence.5-10 minutes into it I realized the acting is terrible, the plot(so far) is predictable and cliche, the dialog is on the nose and full of exposition. My sister and I are now laughing at every single scene. This movie is terrible. If you like bad TV-shows then you might like this film. I feel sorry for the director who definitely tried. Big sound effects, special effects, stunts, and very professional and highly skilled cinematography. But the director lacked one thing, a sense of who to cast and a sense of how to fix bad, over acting.I've wasted my 3-4 dollars on this film. I would be very angry about it, but I'm not because obviously someone spent a lot of their life making this film, and doing the best they could.I have turned it off before seeing the end and am moving onto another film."
4,Outlander movie,"Lots of action, interesting plot, actors did well, special effects were good. Only wish it had been a little longer for more character and the ""Viking"" era of the environment to be more fully developed."
2,Boring,"This movie had a lot of promise (alien crashes on earth during the viking times!) but squandered it. It's hard to pin down exactly how, but the action sequences were pretty boring. In addition, and this is true of pretty much any movie I see involving aliens, if they can )(&*@)($# fly billions of light years, why don't they have some badass weapons? I mean, wouldn't an advanced alien race's warriors have like mini-energy gattling guns implanted in their fingers or something? Instead, this alien has 1 standard issue energy weapon which he promptly loses. Uh... ok so alien's are clumsy too. Some of the pacing of the plot lags too, leaving you to twiddle your thumbs or fast forward to the action scenes."
2,"not bad, not good enough","the box blurb says "" Beowulf meets Predator ""and that's basically what you get. I watched the entire movie, so it's not bad; it's just not that good. If the writers had altered a few basic points this would be a great film; for instance if the monster appeared to be even a tad sentient, the entire plot would become heavier. Also, The monster is too large, basically. This basic fact spoils most monster stories. The story plods along pretty well. The monster waits patiently while the characters develop their interactions and slight storyline. The ending is predictable and broadcast weakly, but it's still enjoyable.It feels like the original story was going to explain the Beowulf myth by interjecting aliens; but that possibility gets lost along the way. Nothing to be ashamed of here. The Viking designs are adequate; the acting is adequate."
5,Cheap and seems to be high quality,"This stuff is very powdery and dissolves fast in liquid, unlike other creatines out there that I've used. I ran out of my normal creatine one day and was forced to buy this MRM brand at a vitamin supplement shop. This stuff works very well and it's probably one of the cheapest creatines out there. This is the brand that I use regularly now.I use creatine primarily for strength training, and not exclusively for bulking-up...so I don't know if this will bulk you up better than other creatines. One teaspoon of this right before a workout is sufficient for me. Taking 2 teaspoons a day seems to be wasteful IMO. If you take a teaspoon of this right before a hard workout, you shouldn't have sore muscles the next day."
2,Pickwick Papers,"I didn't finish it. Ordinarily I love Dickens, but this one wasn't such a page turner and there were no attractive characters at all."
3,Slow,A classic book that was a little slow going. I had to stop a few times and read other books between.
4,Review of the Kindle Version,"Not going to review the book - just the formatting, etc for Kindle. It's pretty good for Kindle - the drawings are lovely, and clear, but they don't come in the correct places (some way after the ""incident"" is over, some before.) Few, if any spelling mistakes, etc., and pretty easy navigation. Probably not the easiest book to read on Kindle - as it'd be nice to have the chance to go back and forth and recall events, character-traits etc., and that's not very easy to do. Hope this helps - Happy New Year."
2,Select Phone 2001 edition,I have this and was checking it out only to find it not up to date. I was checking addresses and I am not even listed in it. I have kived at this address for 2 years and not listed. But yet it is the 2001 version.I planned on using it to notify people and businesses of a new ceiling service I now provide but how many notices will I get back because either the people have moved or the businesses have closed within the past couple years.
3,Good for the starters in time-series analysis,"Well written, this book would be good for the practitioners with engineering background and without rigorous mathematics. The coverage is rather conventional or classical in the sense that intelligent appoaches are not touched."
4,HAVE YOU EVER BEEN LOW?,"Well, only in the chart position, it's a shame this song didn't got the chart position it deserved over the top 40 in the Billboard 100, but since, Radio keeps playing only hip hop and rap music, it's obvious that LOW didn't got the chance it deserved, this is one of that strong ballads that are uplifting, and yeah you know get on with your life and move on...a great tune by Kelly, and of course the mixes for this song should have been ackward so the extra tracks are mixes by MISS INDEPENDENT a total girl attiutde power infected with great party stomper club mixes, great single, worth the money."
3,thumbs up,"This is an enthusiastic book filled with advice on how to succeed in business. I read this book two years ago when I was broke, and it's 2 years later, and I'm still flat on my ass. But it's fun to read."
5,"""Swin with the Sharks"" is a keeper.",While reading books (Or listening on Audio) I hear the title of Swim with the Sharks come up. I also here reference to the author. So I decided to check it out for myself and bought the audio.Interesting book.This book is a gold mine for any person in sales. But it is also good for anyone wanting to start a business or works in management.And finally it is also entertaining in its own right.Sometimes I donate my books to charity or give them to a friend but this is a Keeper.
3,Spend a little more and get Tipton's best gun vise,"This is a sturdy and high quality vise that assembles easily. The problem with it is that the clamping action is asymmetrical. In other words, when you clamp down the butt of your rifle stock, the rifle gets pushed off the centerline of the vise. You have to add padding to one side of the butt stock to keep the rifle centered in the vise, which can be a hassle that one can do without. Keeping the rifle centered in the vise is a great help when mounting a scope. That is why if I had the chance to do it over again, I would spend more money and get Tipton's best gun vise, which has a symmetrical clamping action because the vise jaws are movable on both sides of the rifle stock."
3,Definitely not Tipton's Best Gun Vise,"Fortunately I picked one of these up cheap at a gun show. I would not have paid full price for it. I rate it as basically adequate. One step up from not having a vise at all. There are no adjustments in this model. It seems to be designed for one specific size/style of gun. My Savage 10 .308 fits in it ok. I mounted it to do some scope work. The buttstock clamp caused the rife to roll slightly, moving the scope off vertical. The vise held the gun horizontally ok. I resolved the roll by putting a towel as padding in between the stock and the rubber pad. Mounting my Saiga with Tapco telescoping pistol grip stock required all my jury-rigging skills :) but I got it to stay adequately enough to clean the gun. I do like all the molded places to put things in the base of the vise. And it is holding up to the solvents, etc. So, it's basically adequate."
2,Well design but ...,"This is a well designed model but the LCD is horrible. When I bought it, I found the LCD is very bad. I changed it for three times, and each time I could find some dead pixels (such as always white / black / gray)on the LCD. Finally, I gave it up. If you want to buy this model, take care on the LCD testing"
1,"BAD, VERY BAD","Can somebody believe those baby face actors, look like tough cowboys? I've always seen men playing cowboys in films, not smooth-faced teens. And who had the idea to put a rap in a western movie? If Colin Farrel wants to be a good actor he musn't accept these characters, and Scott Caan is very far from be that good actor his father is. And Ali LArter? She looks like a Barbie in cowgirl disguise, it takes more than a pretty face and whipped cream bikini to be a good actress.Keeo your money in your pocket and buy one of those good old western movies, you'll see good actors and good movies with good plots. Not this nonsense."
2,jesse james falls,This has to be one of the worst westerns I have seen.Below Average storyline grade D+. Actors grade C-. Action C. Special effects/Graphics C+. This movie was not that good at all. It was far too short. It ended at the climax which is very bad. The acting was horrible. The storyline was fiction based. I felt like I was the one that got robbed by Jesse James for $6.50. If they even think of a a sequel to this they are very mistaken. A very disapointing movie. Jesse James and his brother and his cousins the Younger's go to war with a railroad company.
1,This is pain,"Oh man, this movie scarred me for good. I had to watch it in a history class, which is a complete farce, since this is about as historical as the Lord of the Rings. To make matters worse, the movie is awful. The frequent attempts at humor are totally abysmal, and you can see the actors' embarrassment. What is this anyways? A Western for adolescent girls? What are a bunch of hairless pretty boy actors doing portraying wild hoodlums? What's with the pointless, gratuitous romance? What is this crap? Where are Clint Eastwood and Lee Van Cleef when you need them? Unless you're an adolescent with an IQ between 30 and 90, avoid this at all costs."
4,Fun little western,I thought this movie was very funny and also Colin Farrell was so great in it as Jesse James.The James brothers and Young brothers come back from war to find that the Pinkertons want to buy their farm from them.After the Pinkertons kill Jesse's mother then the James-Younger gang start to take money from the railroads for revenge.Their is some romance between Zee Mims and Jesse of course too.Overall this is a fun movie not to take too seriously just enjoy the ride it takes you on!
4,A fun movie!!,"This movie is what a movie was designed to do! Entertain you for a hour and half...peroid. Ok, its not historically accurate...so what? It was zainey, fun, action packed and some great casting! Enjoy!"
4,very good western,This movie is buy far one of the best made westerns I've seen in a long time. There are plenty of action scenes and lots of laughs. The cast is excellent and there talent and friendship come across in this movie. There is some language in this movie so send the kids to their room and enjoy a fun different kind of western.
1,This movie is too low quality for television,"This HAD to have started out as a television project. Better acting could have come from auditions at my local high school. Believe me, this is one that Colin Farrell will wish his whole life he could forget. The budget must have been tiny, the director and writer must have not seen any westerns, and based their production on Dr. Quinn Medicine Woman!For those of you that think it is a five star film, I pity you. You must be under the age of 30 and new to the western genre. Go rent some classic westerns, then watch this again. It stinks to high heaven. I'm embarrassed for the producers.Ewwww!"
4,perfect for little one,This is my one year olds favorite boko. He may not be the target age but he loves the repetition and all of the animals. He likes to find each one other places in his room. It also inspired his first sign -- lion.
1,"Boring, boring, boring","My daughter and I have enjoyed reading all of Eric Carle'sbooks but I am sending this one back. His books use a lot ofrepetition which is fine, but there is no variety to the vocabulary and no story line at all in this book. Definitely not worth the price."
4,A Unique Collection,This book offers a unique and close to encyclopeadic collection of pictures and details of the currently sailing tall ships around the world. Having sailed on a few and seen many more whilst sailing in both Europe and the UK I found pretty well all of them in here.Thad is a reknowned photographer of the tall ships and has been for many years. This collection brings all of that together in one place with the usual quality and understanding of his subject matter that you would expect.I was particularly fortunate to meet the author and get a signed copy during The Tall Ships Race 2000...and no it is not for sale!:-)
3,"Good, but not Great","I'm currently using Fellowes WriteRIGHT on my I300 and I'm happy to have it. It does what it says it will do: protects your pda screen. It is, however, a real pain in the neck to put on without air bubbles. I ruined 4 of the packaged 12 getting one on that I could live with. Hense, only three stars."
5,Great price,Goods came as discribed by seller. Fast shipping and I was able to use my Wee that evening.
5,Consider this book!!,"I knew nothing about applying makeup outside of what I had learned about applying the basics. I stumbled up this book and althought the price is a little high, I was sure this was the make-up book I had been waiting for. There are before and after pictures of all the girls and then a clear sheet to lay over the picture to tell you where/what color to apply to achieve the desired look in the image. Then he explains later at the end of each chapter what techniques to use.The most helpful book I have ever bought about applying make up.Good for the beginner and the advanced."
3,norah jones,"Am I the only one that thinks that ""I am Calling You"" is the inspiration of Norah Jones' ""Don't Know Why""?and that ""I am Calling you"" is far better.... buy the soundtrack for that song. it is worth it."
3,"Nice, but....","I liked a couple of the songs on it, but the rest of them were not that great without them being on the movie. If you own the movie, then stick to that. The CD is a disappointment."
4,A Contemporary Band with their roots right where they should be.,Being both a surfer and a musician this album really speaks to me. It's one of those rare cds you can just put in your player and let run through the entire course. The driving lines in Swampabilly Hop really feel like what it is like to be out paddling through the surf. If you're into surf music at all this is definatly one for your collection.
2,Spacesaver,"These are truly a space saver. However, they are difficult to roll-up &they split easily. I ended up with only 2 usable for a three week trip.I probably won't be recommending these to anyone."
3,Good for storing seasonal clothing,"I bought these space saver bags, not for a suitcase, but to store clothes, sheets and blankets in while traveling. I have a travel trailer and storage is limited so space saver bags definitely come in handy. I wanted to store clothes not in season to free up closet and drawer space and these work good for that. I do have to say that they are not what I expected. They look (and feel) like an over sized zip freezer bag. I don't think they are very durable and I have read other reviews that said theirs have ripped. I haven't had that problem with them but I was careful not to over fill. It wasn't hard to get the air out of the bags. I sat on them to squish them and zipped them while still sitting on them. They do the job and work for what I wanted to use them for. I just wish they were a sturdier bag, but I guess you get what you pay for and they were inexpensive."
2,Still Retains Air,"Rolling the bag produces air, having to zip the bag allows for some air to be trapped in the bag preventing the bag from being totally flat.(like a ziploc bag)I think the kind that requires a vacum suction probably perform better. I was able to remove more air from the rolled bag by placing a vacum hose in the bag.I would not recommend this product."
2,Poorly Made & Doesn't Really Save Space,"These bags are not worth the price you pay for them. They're essentially giant Zip-Loc bags, and honestly, I think I can achieve the same result with a Zip-Loc bag.It does remove all the air out of the bag by rolling the bag filled with clothes, and it is vacuum sealed. However, when I opened the bag to get my clothes out, the zipper ripped the bag along the top edge rendering it useless. So my suggestion, if you decided to buy this product, be careful on how you open the bag.The other issue I have is with its usefulness. The bags don't really save that much room in my luggage. You're restricted to how you pack because all your clothes are restricted to the bag. In the end, I was able to pack more items in my luggage without the bags by just tightly rolling up my clothes into logs."
1,Absolute Trash,"They are not air tight. I bought a package of the travel Space bags that you role the air out of instead of vacuum out. Initially they seemed to work, but by a day later, all the bags had filled with air again. I tried several times with different sealing methods and fewer or different items in them, but the result was always the same. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY. Most of the reviewers here had the same problem. I purchased a roll of clear, industrial type office trash bags that did the same job much better and for far less money."
2,Not great,"So I took another set of these when I deployed, the type that use a vacuum to suck the air out. I thought these would be great for my shorter trips. Unfortunately they don't live up to their big brothers. First I couldn't get all the air out of them easily, no matter how much pressing and pushing I did. The small air escape mechanism forced me to position the bag in such a way to allow the air to escape. Secondly, if you don't hold it right there is a chance you'll pop the bag. Yup, that's what happened to me. I popped one on the first attempt to push the air out. Overall, I'm not happy with this purchase and wouldn't recommend them."
5,Brightest Headlamp Ever,Never seen one with more distance or overall power. It's a little bulky but definitely worth it. Nice strap too!
4,Required repair,I purchased this headlamp to replace a broken headlamp for work. The light on this lamp was amazing. It is bright and illuminated good sized area. As great as the light was it was continually falling to the lowest position. Doing activities like walking or using a skill saw the slightest bump would cause this lamp to fall to the lowest position. Seeing many positive reviews associated with this product I figured it must be a defect with my lamp. I called Princeton Tec and was issued a RMA. I sent the lamp to them and 18 days later I received it back. Princeton tec %100 fixed the issue. The lamp now locks in place enough I could go jogging with the lamp and not have it change position on me.Despite needing a repair I would still highly recommend this lamp. I have used quite a few lamps for work and this one is my favorite. Great illumination. The RMA process was very painless and pretty quick. 18 days is very reasonable considering it had to travel across the country and back.
4,Where's my memory stick??,"I love it, it's almost all I could have asked for...but when it says ""AND MEMORY STICK"", I expect to recieve a memory stick! I only got a tape to record. The whole purpose of buying this was to not have to worry about tapes and all of that confusing organizing that comes with it. Where's the memory stick? Take that off of the description if you aren't going to send it!! It really upset me!"
4,Recommended Changes,"I am very much enjoying the book and would even more with some changes.1. The 5x7 format is not user friendly for me -- the volumn is on the thick side as a result.2. Would be great if there was a listing of the fish that are compatible with a community tank -- perhaps even sub-categories within the major listing.3. At the front of the book is a page that, in small diagrams, point out how to build a tank. This is so sketchy it should be removed or expanded to match the expertize of the rest of the book."
5,great freshwater hobbyist book,This is a great book for hobbyists of all levels. It is filled with detailed information and great pictures.I am really thrilled to own it.
4,critic,interesting and easy to read. A good first approach of the bollywood film industry. Not enough photos and no colours.
3,"Useful, but flawed","Consider this book well-researched, but written by an outsider. As such, if you follow it religiously you'll find your scripts always smell a little bit like heartland spec.You're better off with a book written by someone who's worked in Hollywood with scripts, in the trenches, reading till his eyes bleed. There are other guides written by such industry insiders -- decorum prohibits me listing them here, but they're easy enough to find.Put it this way: do you really want a screenwriting guide written by a guy who lives in Massachusetts? :-)"
1,Not what you are lead to believe.,"This company borders on deceptive practices when describing their software products. If you are wanting to use this product for mailing lists, be aware that you are limited in the number of listings you can export, then you must purchase more.I'd say the service that this company provides is invaluable to mass marketer's, but the way they promote themselves and their software products is surprisingly shady."
3,Interesting but dense,"This book reads more like a textbook than anything else. The pages are dense with factual, historical information. It is interesting but, if you are looking for an easy read describing the Irish immigrant journey into and through Boston history, this is not the book for you."
4,confusing but great fun,"I checked out Nostradamus Ate my Hamster from the library based just on its bizarre title and was not at all disappointed. This very unusual story was hilarious, at times disturbing, and occasionally offensive, but almost entirely enjoyable. A warning to the reader: be prepared to abandon all rationality and to suspend disbelief, because this is a book that breaks all the rules. If you enjoy the work of Douglas Adams (Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy) and Monty Python's Flying Circus, this sci-fi comedy/fantasy is highly recommended."
2,Not what I expected.,"Purchased this ""movie"" thinking I was getting a movie and ended up with a 125 minute speech. However, I watched it all and was impressed with Mr. Saderup's performance. If you are into history then you will enjoy this. It's probably not coincidence that this was released while the ""movie"" version of Lincoln is in the theaters."
3,Needed more story or more nudity,"This movie is one hour and twelve minuets long and was released in theaters April 26, 1985. At best the nudity is mild. There are some scenes where the guy fondles the breasts and where the clothes are ripped from the breasts, but no full nudity scenes. The plot is simple. Set in Roman times; Romans sack a village where the prince and princess are to be married that day. The princess survives and sets out with a few of her warriors to retrieve he betrothed. The meet a small village group of resistance fighters and align with the princess to overthrow the evil leader and rescue her future husband. End the end, they overthrow the merciless leader and live happily ever after. The end. Over all it is a pretty lame film with a weak story to it."
5,Heavyhands - great buy!,"Exactly what I was looking for - compact, comfortable hand weights. Easy to change out the amount of weight with easy screw on ends. Fits the hands perfectly."
2,Terrible Value for the $$$ and it's not Legal.,"If your thinking of getting one of these to become a wanna be Ham operator with out a License, don't waste your money! Most Hams don't hang around 10 Meters and if you do find one he's not going to talk to you without a legal call sign and will most likely just report you if in doubt. This radio is designed to skirt past the laws by being modifiable to get over the Legal Power limits and out of the Legal bands and anyone posting a two page document to tell you otherwise is just Lawyering up the situation.The terrible value part is that you can take your Technician exam with only a few hours of studying and become a real Ham operator and then buy a Real Ham Radio that does 10 times as much as this radio for the same price! And the big bonus is that Ham Operators will talk to you and you will have access to Bands that work year round like 80M, 40M and 20 Meters as well as 10M in a legal way"
2,Squished,"The majority of balls arrived already dented and squished. One tumble into the ball pit and the rest dented up too. That being said, they are easy to reshape and do not loose all of thier air allowing plenty of playtime even when dented. They are also very soft when thrown. Not a terrible product, I just wish they held their shape a little more."
1,Wrong colors,Wrong bag then pictured in the picture. Wrong colors. False information. Why would my son want bright pick balls. Misleading pictures and will not do this again.
2,"""The Endless Bummer""","Nostalgia aside, you gotta admit: it was a '70s ultra-cheese fest, starring future burn-outs Jan-Michael Vincent and Gary Busey, and William Katt, who would go on to star in one of the most lame TV shows of all time ""The Greatest American Zero""."
4,Surfing Movie,This one is not just a documentary about surfing. It is actually a good life/friendship movie... And let's not forget about the waves! I enjoy watching this movie.
1,bad product,"i bought this dvd recorder on 121705, and now, it will not write any dvd's i buy.... don't buy it....... it is a waste of money!!!!"
2,records fine ..could not play it on other dvd players,I was able to record fine. I got it from costco for $120-$30.00 off = $100.00 with taxI can record (timer record) and play it on the Lite-on ddvd recorder but i cannot play it on the computer nor on other dvd players like the sony and samsung ....
1,Not good enough,"Just like the previous reviewer said, it does not have an S-Video input and output. I wanted to transfer my laserdiscs to DVDs and having no S-Video just won't do. I thought I could use an RCA to S-Video converter. Video playback was awful. It had jitters and the color red was unnaturally more pronounced. This is getting returned."
2,lite-on - wrong priorities,"I bought the LVW-5115 after giving up on my second LVW-5005. I hoped this model would be better.It still freezes up, but the 5005 froze when I pushed stop while this one freezes when I push pause.The color is just wierd. It shifts everything toward the green.It stops recording (some of the time) if there is a gap in the tape you are trying to copy. My old videotapes are full of these gaps. I think this problem results from Lite-on's (similar to other manufacturers') concern that I might copy copyrighted videotapes. So, the recorder is very sensitive to anomalies in the signal. Of course, this makes no sense because the law very explicitly allows people to make one copy of any copyrighted material for his or her own use.But this is not what I was trying to do, anyway. My old tapes are from TV shows, recorded on my own VCR. This unit is going back and I guess I will try another brand."
4,The thieves know the least,I like Jason Statham. Not all of his movies are great choices for him but this movie was a surprise. It was so good and didn't get a lot of press. It is based on a true story that was kept quiet for many years. It's a British bank heist where most of the thieves knew little of what was actually the objective. I don't want to spoil it for anyone. Just see it.
3,the Bank Job,I liked the movie there was alot of action. I love Jason Stratham I think he is a good actor. This movie was just one way of him just extending or not trapping himself in on role.
5,A Necessary Supplement to Your Reading,"This is a great resource. At a glance, it looks like (and maybe it is) a coffee table book, but that appearance shouldn't fool you. Nearly every personality from the Civil War is covered in this book, with photographs or paintings of many of them. The biographies are not limited to birth and death dates, but include the individual's participation in the War, and many entries ""editorialize"" a bit to give some perspective on the person's personality, reputation, and overall impact on the War. I've noticed more than a few typographical errors in the text (misspellings, etc.), but these don't detract from the book's value. As with a good book of Civil War maps (see my other reviews), this resource can both make for good browsing, and be an indispensable supplement to your Civil War reading. When reading a War history, I find that it's easier to keep track of the lesser-known generals and soldiers if I have a face and some background. This book helps greatly."
1,WASTE OF MONEY!,"This CD is merely a PDF of thousands of web pages.Additionally, it is not even well organized. For instance, on of the files is over 2000 pages long, without a table of contents.Whoever publishes this should be ashamed for taking money from cancer patients and their families."
2,satellite A135 S2246,"I got one for $400 from office depot with Vista home basic installed. it's cheap and I only need a laptop to surf the web.I soon found out that the LCD display can only do 60 Hertz refresh rate, wich is very uncomfortable to my eyes.Should have spend a bit more $ to get a better one."
4,One improvement needed for the Kindle edition,"I love the LOTR triology, and consequently our paperback copy has started to fall apart from use. So I was really happy to be able to download this version of LOTR onto my Kindle TouchThe Lord of the Rings. I'm basically very happy with the Kindle version. The only negative comment I have is that the maps are extremely small and difficult to read. I have to have my paperback copy of LOTR next to me (which is a larger size paperback) so I can refer to the maps. It would be nice if the Kindle offered some kind of feature where you could zoom in on the maps to enlarge them and/or navigate around them."
2,Loooooooooooooooong and boooooooooooring,This was one prepostrous story. And it was unnecessarily long.
5,Of the millenial editon...,"These books are an (aging) classic. Regarding the hardcover boxed edition: A very pleasing form. By splitting each text into a couple of small, identical hardcovers, totalling 6 volumes (plus 1 appendix), the series is presented in an easy to read and aesthetically pleasing manner. No goofy fantasy art, each text a manageable 200 pages or so, and very strong cover art. I'd not read the books in many years, but found this edition irrisistible."
5,The Big - Bang of Epic Fantasy,"Are we worthy of such a book ? If you read it, you will understand why all fantasy and fiction books of the 20th century simply repeat its scenes, heroes and language. Simply magnificent. Read it."
3,Not as good as Feist,"I'm a huge fan of fantasy writing, and before you all go biting my head off, i enjoyed the book. The storyline was fantastic, but Tolkien is just not my style of writer. Raymond E Feist, I beleive, has accomplished much more in his books of the riftwar saga. He might not be as highly credited as Tolkien, but i believe that his writing style is more mature. Tolkien seems to write as if addressing people that wont understand real fantastical writing. Give the storyline to a different writer, and the book would have received a 6 out of 5 from me."
3,The Lord Of The Rings...,"This book a great book if you like action fantasy books. Also if you like elves and dwarves then this is defenitly a book you should read. It's an action packed book with even some scary parts in it. The story is kind of confusing to follow. Also in some of the parts there are some boring parts where there are lots of diffrent conversations, which are very long and boring. I think this is more of an adult book than a child book because it's kind of confusing. Anyway it's a great book."
5,The greatest book ever,"Lord of the Rings was great. It is action packed and filled with adventure. I find that the character would act like I do at times. The characters were not believable at all. Elves and dwarfs, wizards, and hobbits could never exist.The book really holds you to the story. It is hard to stop because the plot is so good. It is really interesting. The plot is believable though. It is in the right sequence."
5,"LOTR, classic","This one volume edition of LOTR is great. The books are a wonderful read, and never get old. If you haven't read them before, or have only seen the movies, definitely give these books a try."
5,Lord of the Rings three volume set,The books arrived promptly and in very good condition. It would have been helpful to know how big they are (big) and how heavy.The Lord of the Rings
3,good but overrated,"It goes without saying that Tolkien has done a great work creating Middle Earth, a world of fantasy, but huge number of characters in the book seem to be one of pitfalls for the book (in my opinion), the characters in the book have somewhat developed personalities but on a basic level. They aren't characters that i feel i can cheer os gasp for."
5,These are the best books I have ever read.,"These are the best books I have ever read. They have interesting characters, storyline, everything you could want in a book. It is not only a fantasy book, it is a adventure book."
2,A Review of The Hobbit,"Tolkien might have been an extraordinary fantasy writer back in his time, but there are more and better fantasy writers now (ie. Margaret Weis, Tracy Hickman) that make his books seem dull and boring to read. That's why I can't understand why his books are so highly revered. Therefore, he receives two stars from me."
5,Beautiful Edition,This is a simply beautiful edition of the Lord of the Rings.In fact it's so pretty I almost don't want to read from it.
4,"Good book, but a little bit too expensive","I don't want to say something about the content of the book here, because I think everybody knows it. I give my opinion only to the books printing.First it is only artificial leather bounded. Therefore the price is a little bit too high.... Otherwise the printing inside is ok and very good to read, because the letters are not too small and not as bad as some customers have written here. Also the book block is not glued slanting into the book and the map at the end is also ok.All in all 4 stars and not 5, because of the wrong information about the cover material and the high price."
2,Missing pages,"Just started reading this edition outloud to my daughter. It is missing a part of the story between pages 125-126. The pages are numbered correctly, but there is part missing. For the price you might try a better edition. Love the story, I have read it many times."
4,Very nice...,"I'm reviewing the latest Houghton Mifflin print of the Lord of the Rings 50th ann addition.This is a beautiful book, no question. Two reasons why I didn't give it a 5 star.1) It's a little confusing from other reviews and book description whether this is really leather. With this book in hand, I can say it is NOT leather. It is leather look. In fact, it is not the best faux leather either, but it is a nice material and cover.2) There's a little bit of rubber glue that holds the foldout maps shut. Opening this is a bit hard and leads to a little bit of rip. So be careful when you open it for the first time. Once open, you can rub off the rubber glue and it's all good.Otherwise this is a great book. Good size and heft. Typeset is big enough to read easily. It's a keeper."
5,A book beyond it's times,Classic story and reading. It held my interest for years. I first read it when a teenager and now at 51 I still enjoy it.
2,Not worth the money,"Leather is ""leather-look"" paper on both box and book cover. Page edge gilding is a tacky bright gold. As others have said, because of improperly placed glue, unfolding the maps guarantees ripping the maps (you might have better results if you bend the maps so that you remove the glue from inside out). At any rate...I now have a brand new $50 book with scotch tape on the damaged parts of the maps. Paper is very slick & somewhat shine-y and there is zero info as to whether it is acid-free. I cannot recommend this edition."
3,"Well, you can always consider...","... buying the BBC version instead. To be fair with Mind's Eye Version of the LOTR Audiobook, it's not bad. It's closer to the original storyline that BBC's and it even features mr Tom Bombandil who was cut from BBC's version. The voices are good - but not all of them.On the downside however, as an audio engineer myself, I have to say that ""Mind's Eye"" should hire someone else to remaster their records. Sound quality is not as good as I thought it would be.On the opposition there is the BBCs all time classic version with excellent voices and wonderfull performances by the actors, based on an equaly wonderfull adaptation of Tolkiens story. If you only compare the two ""Gandalfs"" you will see what I mean. Mind's Eye version seems to be the kids version while BBC's the adult's one. And the latter sounds better too..."
2,"Wonderful imagination, but mediocre and redundant writing","After reading Harry Potter and the Chronicles of Narnia, I was very interested in other books by the authors that these have been compared to. I picked up Fellowship of the Ring, and I made my way through it, determined to read it. Tolkien has a wonderful imagination, but the plot is a bit redundant and the writing is hard to understand at points. I have read other works far more advanced, so my lack of understanding is not from being uneducated. It just doesn't flow. My two stars were for his imagination, because I respect anyone who takes a chance with the creation of another world. Bottom line: While he has an imagination, this is a book you might have to struggle with because of it's mediocre writing."
1,Sorry but Blah,"It may be my age but I unfortunatly found this to be one of the most boring books I have ever laid my eyes on. I have read many other great fantasy authors i.e. Feist, Jordan and McCaffrey but I read this book and thought I was going to be absolutly amazed at how good it was supposedly according to almost all of the people who reviewed it. I dragged myself through two of the books in this trilogy and I will never again pick up another Tolkien book."
3,"ok, not as good as i had expected",everyone told me how amazing this book is supposed to be. so i thought hey i'll give it a try. The book often slow at times. the best part in the book is at the very end once everyone goes back home and fix things. the hobbit deserves more praise than this book. i hope they make the movie really well.
2,A Glorious Display of a Glorious Story,"This 50th Anniversay Edition is not only a beautiful product but one to be treasured. To see the Lord of the Rings, the way it was supposed to be, in a single binding, is a delight to any avid fan of the books. The attention to detail is evident and a salute to Tolkien. The addition of the pages from the book Gandalf found in Moria is a rare treat! It is a wonderful additon to any 'Ringers' collection."
5,AMAZING,"Here's a little 'history' of the publishing: when Tolkien wrote 'Lord of the Rings', he wrote it as one book, wanted it read as one book, published as one book. 2 out of 3 isn't bad. Back in the day (1954-55) it was costly to print it as one book, so it got split into 3 (Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers, Return of the King). Many years later, you go to the book shop and it like wall-to-wall with different varities of this book. I highly recommend getting the 'single voulme'. One book is easier to keep track of and store rather than three. Plus, it's how Tolkien WANTED it to be published. Now that he has passed away (Sept 2, 1973), as a reader, it's kind to respect his wishes. I don't want to spoil the book, other than you should The Hobbit first to really KNOW the WHOLE story, though you don't have to. Both The Hobbit and Lord of the Rings are excellent books. Highly recommended."
5,The Red Book,"The Lord of the Rings finally gains its true face, as Bilbo's Red Book. This deluxe edition, with its red box and its fine golden elven runes, is the definitive incarnation of a masterpiece. By far the the best edition ever. And, of course, a must have for any Tolkien's fan. As for the book itself, well, there is little more I can say that has not been already said."
2,"The Lord of the Rings (Millennium Edition), a comment","This comment relates only to the physical appearance and binding of the The Lord of the Rings (Millennium Edition)box set. I was planning to purchase this set for my son and recently observed two box sets at a local book store. Both sets had irregularities in the size of two of the seven volumes in this set. They were noticeably shorter than the companion volumes, that is, as they sat on the shelf, the binding edges were uneven. The clerk broke the plastic seal so we could inspect the books more carefully and confirmed that they were imperfect. We also observed that the bindings appeared to be second rate, the pages were glued, not stitched, to the binding. Essentially paperback bindings in a mis-matched hard cover. We checked the second set the store had in stock and found the exact same problem with the size of the volumes. Certainly not worth the (...) retail price.Thom Robbin"
5,the best fantasy book of all time,"A few years ago, I read THE HOBBIT. One day, I was telling my friend how much I loved it, and her sister said, "" You should read LORD OF THE RINGS."" I kind of shrugged it off and never bothered to read it, figuring it couldn't possibly be as good as THE HOBBIT. Then I saw the movie. It was so cool I just had to read the book. I bought a boxed set in August, and before the month was over, I had read it twice. It is the absolute best book I have ever read. It is written very very well, and I love the way all of the races are so different.J.R.R. Tolkien has created this amazing, realistic world; complete with countries, different cultures, and an antagonist. The members of the Fellowship are so colorful and well described, that after you finish the book you feel like you know them personally. I recommend this book to anyone who can read."
2,Thoroughly disappointed,"The product description says, ""audiobook"", and I was thrilled to be getting them at such a low price. One review in particular described it as unabridged, too. Why it's reviewed that way, I can hardly guess. When I received it, I found it to be a complete dramatization, not an ""audiobook"" at all. The dramatization is ok, I guess, but not great. I was expecting an audiobook, and got a dramatization - plain and simple. Very, very disappointed. I haven't had many bad experiences with Amazon, but I feel deceived."
5,The Lord of the Rings is a spectacular literary achievement,"The Lord of the Rings is a triumph. Tolkien has successfully meshed a wonderful story with brilliant wording and characterization. His depictions of Middle-earth and its inhabitants are so vivid that readers can easily associate with a world that appears at once fantastic yet all too similar to our own. Not only is The Lord of the Rings Tolkien's personal crowning achievement, it is a literary work worthy of a place among the classics. Praise Tolkien."
2,Blurry print,"The print was smudgy and really not clean throughout all three volumes. There were no illustrations in this edition. I was unable to separate Amazon's reviews between the different editions of the LOTR, so it was easy to make the mistake of ordering this one. I returned it."
5,AMAZING !!!!!!!!,I thought this book so good that I could read it over and over again!! I reacomend this book for 10 year olds and up. It's verrrry intense but I still love it.
3,good but slow,"it got to me a week later than expected, missing my friend's birthday. but quality is good."
2,Bored of the Rings,"This is undoubtedly one of the most boring fantasy epics I have ever forced myself to wade through. Perhaps it's popularity is due to the originality of thought it posessed when first published, but compared to the myriad of rich, and engaging works available now, it really is just not worth the effort.Read it if you have a desire to study the history of fantasy writing, or unlimited time to squander."
2,The manufacturer and quality control suck,"I have attempted to buy this book 3 times from amazon,the two copies sent were both damaged ,so I went to other stores to order it,3 more copies from borders all damaged and I am wondering how poor the book companies employee attention must be to ship out damaged items at almost $100 a pop. I was attempting to give this as a gift and have been on a month journey trying to find just one book not ripped,ink stained,etc. This is pretty sad for a collectors edition LOTR item and totally looks down upon Tolkiens good name.Unless you can personally inspect it dont bother ."
5,One of my favorite pieces of literature,"I began reading this series when I was about 16 years old or so. The latest film, based on the books, Peter Jacksons ""The Fellowship of the Ring"", really brought my interest to the story. I hadn't heard of the Trilogy until after I'd seen FOTR.I believe people sometimes need to take a break from things and enjoy a good story of such magnitude; to suspend our worries over petty things,and to embrace a story that uses our brains, forgetting our societal customs for a bit and embracing our imaginations. To dip a toe into the pond of escapism.In any case, the book is a great story with great characters. These characters act independently and with each other in an attempt to rid their world of an evil that plagues them. It is a story that has a familiar aspect to it. The Shire is reminiscent of youthful adventures, and even though there was no Gandalf when I was younger, it seems like there should have been."
5,"Shakespeare, give way to Tolkien","I have found this the best written creation ever. It is not as dull as Shakespeare's most books, who will talk to you about fobidenn love, but this book is magic itself. Love, magic, epic battles, good vs. evil, selfishness, hate, glory, ecology, etc., is all in the Lord of the Rings.If Tolkien was born 4000 years before, he might as well be called God Himself."
1,Mis-labeled,"The book clearly mentions 'Alan Lee' as the illustrator, but the book is not the illustrated version, and only has some picture on the book cover. This is very misleading and makes the book to expensive for its assumed value. Please change the label."
5,A Bonafide Masterwork,"I was Trekker reading Trek novels for years before finally picking up LOTR at age 20. In 7 fantastic days I read through The Hobbit and LOTR, an awesome experience.The deliberate pacing of sections of Fellowship and Two Towers only served to make my heart race wildly in the Return of the King. J.R.R. Tolkien has few equals in the use of imagery save perhaps C.S. Lewis. I can see with clarity the Palantir clouded with the hands of Denethor, the coming of the fleet of Umbar flying the standard of Elendil flying to the rescue of Gondor. The regal majesty of Aragorn hiding under dour Ranger garb. The perfect beauty of Arwen.Even after dozens of readings over 15 years the picture in my mind becomes ever more clear.As for my bookshelf, Tolkien has overtaken Trek - and well he should. Trek is simplistic compared to the intricately detailed arc that Tolkien created.Frodo Lives! Indeed!"
5,EXCELLENT,"This is a must buy product. The book is so fascinating youll find yourself rereading the storys over and over again. As they say ""There are 2 types of people in the world: peolple who have read THE LORD OF THE RINGS and people who will read it."" This is also way better than the movie becasue once you read it you will find out that it really is much different from the movie."
5,answer to the last post,"First of all, I'm not under 13, only I haven't registered yet.So: You are just a little child, don't expect you have got such intelligence to understand a book. Nah, joke, but anyway. People love Tolkien's style, and for some reason many people could understand the book's story. Maybe you are not so gifted in reading, or just you wasn't trached well in understanding texts, but don't take it to Tolkien's fault, please. It is not his fault that you can't read his book.Martin"
1,Cheap Glossy Print makes it impossible to read with direct light,"I was excited to read this until I actually sat down at night, bedside light next to me, and realized the cheap glossy print was so bad it caused a ""reflection"" that made it impossible to focus if you got too much light.I've never had this problem with a book before (granted all my hardcovers are the nice paper and type).This is a cheap glossy knockoff; pass on it and get real paper and real type."
4,Be careful!,"Unfortunately, you must be careful with these reviews. I gave this only four stars because I have never actually listened to it. I'm writing now to make sure that no one mistakes all of these reviews as pertaining to the featured product. I have heard that the Mind's Eye version is worth hearing, yet the first review I saw on this page was from Scott Truesdell villifying a totally different edition. Note the blue notices at the bottom of each review to keep you on the right track. Please do not assume that the Mind's Eye version is bad because Truesdell's review heading declares the disgracefulness of a different item."
3,"Good, if You Like this Genre","You can't say you didn't get what you paid for. These colossal books, filled with adventures, can certainly keep a person occupied, but as a general warning, these aren't those ""glove-fits-all"" books. You have to be in the mindset for an epic fantasy battle, and though I wasn't, my classmates who read the entire trilogy absolutely adored the stories. I would highly recommend reading The Hobbit before attempting to digest the trilogy, just so the concepts of hobbits, wizards, and Middle Earth, will be old hat."
5,LOTR Hard Cover Collection,"I was completly satisfied with this gift. I ordered it for my boyfriend for Christmas with The Hobbit hard cover. The pictures are beautiful, any and all collectors should own this collection.Good reading as always. Fast and Quick shipping and Delivery. Was at my door step 1 week before Christmas, which was amazing, because I was told it might take longer than that, but somehow it all happened all right.If you are a fan, and you already have the series, then you should know, it's still the same story, but if you do not have the series and you want one that will last and continue to out-live all the others, buy this one, and you'll never have to buy another collection as long as you live."
1,Not at all impressed,"I cannot recommend this product and here's why:1. It is advertised as leatherbound, but I think it's covered in some sort of treated paper made to feel (kind of) like leather. If someone can demonstrate that it is leather, I will be happy to edit this review.2. My copy had the cover artwork way off center.3. The pages began curling almost immediately.I returned it with no problem whatsoever, and my money was refunded promptly so 5 stars to Amazon for that."
2,I...can't... read!!,"This book! I cannot get through it! I know alot of people love these books, but I couldn't get anything out of it. I felt like I was reading nonsense. ""And Merry walked forward, 'to ho, Frodo', but the light for they found was neath the ground and then, yay pickled fury from way into the forest with armor and swords engraved with red and hicksey; to hicksey Frodo seeth the little hobbit house, blah blah blah blah blah blah..."" what the hell! It was harder trying cut my way through this strange, convoluted, purple prose than when I've tried reading an Ann Rice book. I kept wanting the story to advance, but finally I got too tangled in the prose and gave up. I didn't even get to see Gollum."
2,Not as good as everyone seems to think,"I don't know why so many people like this book so much. I guess it's just because they haven't read any better fantasy books. Personally, I found The Lord of the Rings to be very boring. It started out ok, but it goes on and on with nothing interesting ever happening. There were some interesting moments, but nothing to make the book really worth reading. The overwrought description drags on for way too long, and the way the war is described makes the whole story seem like some kind of weird dream rather than a real war. You don't really get a sense that anything is at stake for the main characters. In my oppinion, Magician and A Game of Thrones are way better than this. Stay away unless you like you fantasy slow and boring."
1,Tolkien had WAY too much time on his hands.,"Tolkien had WAY too much time on his hands. Just think about it - spending all that time creating imaginary worlds, peoples, languages and events? With a huge appendix explaining it all? It's insane! Talk about wasting his time! Tolkien would have used his time much better if he had used it to cut the grass for an elderly lady, work as a volunteer in a soup kitchen, or collect money for the blind. Anyone who has the time to make so much time in his imaginary world, let alone write a stack of books about it clearly has WAY too much time on his hands."
5,aguyfromsomewhere,"THIS IS THE BEST STORY EVER TOLD. no one in the future will ever be able to top a classic like this.never.Tolkien is the MASTER of all fantasy,and something a little more.he introduced fantasy A LOT better. it was because of his vivid, fantastic imagination that we even have all these other stories about fantasy. as far as im concerned,his book,The Lord Of The Rings,is the gateway to all the other great fantasy books.this is the one ORIGINAL fantasy.so,I encourage ALL of you to read this classic before it gets drowned in time.read it while you can.TOLKIEN IS FOREVER KING......NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS."
5,"Great book, shipping and price",This is the first time I order a used book and I was very impressed. The book looks good. Thank you!
5,A universe complete,"How many times have I read this? I don't know, I lost count at about fourteen. I am not especially into fantasy literature, not into role-playing at all, but for some reason The Lord of the Rings captured me. It is the sheer DEPTH of the work that astounds me... it is the only work I have ever read (along with all its companion books, like the Silmarillion) that creates a truly and entirely flawless and complete universe all of its own. How can I put the astoundingly complex simplicity of TLOTR in perspective? I can't say. But on the twenty-somethingth run through, I still manage to be surprised."
5,Awesome Book,I bought this for my son for Christmas. My son loves the movie trilogy and I hope he enjoys reading this the way I loved reading this book when I was a child. Fast Shipping and I highly recommend.
1,"Millenium Edition -- bad, bad, bad.","I just received my copy of the just-released Millenium Edition of Lord of the Rings (came out October 99) -- I was extremely disappointed. It is essentially 7 little paperback-type books with hard covers on them. The print is small, of course, but worst of all is the sorry excuse for ""binding"" used by the publishers (done by just glueing a bunch of single pages together). I kid you not, upon opening the first book, a page was already in the process of falling out! If you want a decent hardcopy addition of this outstanding work of literature, go with the 3 volume set from Houghton Mifflin ."
5,Brilliant!!!!!!!,"The English speaking world is divided in two: those who have read the Hobbit and Lord of the Rings, and those who haven't. I have read it four times in the past two years and will continue to reread until I am an old man. But I can honestly say (and those who have read it in excess of 20 times will vouch for me) it NEVER gets boring."
3,Mindblowingly overrated,"Is this a very good book? Yes. Was it the blueprint for most, if not all fantasy novels to come? Yes. Is it ""the best novel of all time""? No. Not even close.It's bloated and overlong; for a book with such a rich plot, there are EXTREMELY long passages where nothing happens at all. The first 200 pages or so could easily be trimmed to 75.The characters rely on constant deus ex machinas to help them along with their quest. An example of this is when the small hobbit Merry faces off against the evil undead lord of the Nazgul, truly a terrifying character. Merry was lucky enough to have found the only magical blade in the world that could pierce his armor, and managed to kill him with a succession of lucky blows. At times it reads like a bad parody of itself.It's worth one read, but not three hundred."
4,"Yes, you can believe what people say!","What can one say that hasn't already been said about the most epic battle of good vs. evil?Immortalized for the generations to come, Lord Of The Rings is amusing, amazing, fun, scary and suspenseful and surely the work of a master writer. The characters are alive, the events real and the landcape ever so uniquely convincing.Perhaps, for once, the legend lives up to its reputation.Never before has the choice of the best work in a given genre been such an easy and universal win."
2,No final inspection - folded pages,"The edges of the first twenty pages were folded and the first red page even torn. I ordered it from Switzerland, shipping it back costs 30$. Too much for a 50$ book."
5,GI complexity,"Your stomach is rather complex, as this book points out. plus there is all that acid in the tummy, which acts up and hurts you. This books tells you how to contol yourself and get you stomach working right."
3,too thick,"I thought that this would be almost silk-like but when I received the product, the fabric was very thick. I am sure it will last a long time but it defeated the purpose of being 1,000 thread. I will no longer buy sheets unless I can touch and feel them."
5,Great book with an interactive touch,"We bought this book for my 4 year old daughter and it has been a huge hit. She loves putting the little cut out mouse through the holes in the pages and reading it over and over again. Very classic little story that kids will enjoy. It is quite tall so it does not fit on an average sized book shelf, but we love this one!"
3,A lot of hype here for pretty standard polyester boxers.,"So I bought these for our multi day backpacking excursions because they wick well, and supposedly resist odors. They feel super comfortable with the exception that they creep up my ashnitz more than normal boxer briefs. They prevent chafing, and breath well. As far as preventing odor, not a chance. Like all polyester/plastic clothing, they seem to reek at the end of the day of normal activity. My standard cotton boxers smell way better after a long day of hiking. Hype sells, but I call bullisht on the odor prevention."
5,good microwave,"Well, I'm no expert on these things, but this microwave seems to do the job pretty damn well by warming/cooking my food quickly, efficiently, and consistently.I have had no problems at all - it's a breeze to use and has more than enough power for everyday use.Definitely recommended."
4,psycho circus rock,"Robert Loveless's brain child with the help of none other than Moris Tepper (Captain Beefheart/Tom Waits/Frank Black/PJ Harvey)For some truly stange and unusual experimental psycho circus rock, check this obscure album out. Spoken word, some mellower tunes too, but be prepared to be disturbed, in a good way."
5,"incredible book, highly recommended","Let me start out by saying this book and the entire series deserves 6 stars, but the Amazon rating box only went up to 5. Whether you've been doing sound,music,engineering for a week or 20 years these books have something for everyone.The full color artwork is the best i've ever seen in any instructional book period.The companion dvd is fantastic, worth the price alone.Bill gibson does a great job with the subject matter and text,he covers the material thoroughly while making it easily understood. Highly recommend."
1,"""Universal"" isn't what it used to be. Won't work with Magnavox TV",I ordered this remote because I wanted something I was SURE would work with my 15 in Magnavox LCD and my Dish Network DVR. It doesn't and it is not worth the trouble to return it.It works fine with the DVR but not at all with the TV. Philips/Magnavox customer service email has been out of service for weeks or months and a phone call to see what code would work with THEIR TV and THEIR remote got me a over-the-wire shrug. Nice.BTW.. I saw the same unit in Walmart for about the same price as shipping on Amazon.
2,It keeps losing the settings!,"I actually bought this at a local store. It works but every once in awhile, the remote will reset and I'd have to get out the book to re-enter the code for my tv. There's no explanation as to why but I am getting pretty tired of resetting the remote. Maybe be cheap but it doesn't work. :("
2,Good - and then BAD.,"About 1 year after having this remote to go along with my Phillips DVD player the remote conked out. The buttons, while almost all responsive, will not sync up with the systems anymore, and the learning feature on the remote control seems to be defunct. You get what you pay for, I suppose!"
4,One Tough Remote,"not only did this remote do everything it promised - programming every feature of my old remote in seconds, but unlike the reviewer below, I found it was quite durable. It survived a trip through a commercial washing machine without any affect to the performance. Very impressive remote, great for the money."
5,So glad I found her!!,Tracking Mireille's albumns singing in french and not german has taken me a long time.I was very happy with the product and the seller's efficiency with which they expedited the order.Thank you.
1,I Can See Why Christopher Walken Committed Suicide...,"For those who are unfamiliar with the SNL sketch - Pat once turned up when Christopher Walken was on - the only way he could escape the confusion was to leap out the window.By the end of this movie, you'll feel similar - Pat's gender bender problems simply last too long for digestible viewing, add how annoying Pat is and it's too much. By the end I was actually relieved it was over.Skip it, pass on it, unless of course you actually *like* Pat."
2,"Funny, but stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid,stupid...but funny","Julia Sweeny, Dave Foley, Charles Rocket, Kathy Griffin and Tim Meadows. A great cast! But I was disapointed to be truthful. I love SNL movies, but this was probably the worst. Pat was funny...in some parts. But the hour and eighteen minutes that this movie last...it lags on. They could of made this a thirty minute short TV thing. I was disapointed to see Dave Foley in drag...again. I was glad to see Tim Meadows with a small role, he needs to get off of SNL and move on with his career or just find something else to do. Kathy Griffin was horrible, I just wanted her to go away. All in all, it was the stupidest movie I ever saw...but it was still pretty funny. Here's an example of SNL skits that shouldn't become movies...wink wink, nudge, nudge...night at the Roxbury?"
1,Worst Movie Made...,"This movie is an abomination of a film. How can people enjoy it? The whole thing was worse than a train wreck (pardon my cliche).I saw it on TV a while back. I admit to being sucked into the mystery of Pat's gender. However, as soon as I googled it and found out that the truth was never revealed, I immediately turned the film off. There was no other incentive for me to keep watching.The so-called ""evolved"" humour is nothing more than one lame joke. I actually cringed quite frequently at some of the gags, which were very immature and not funny in the least.This film may appeal to adolescent males and permanent frat boys, but no one else. For anyone looking for a intellectually stimulating film, I would certainly not reccomend this one."
2,Way too sweet........can't taste the crab apple!,This jelly was way too sweet!! I was hoping for the tartness (and sweetness) of the crab apple jelly/jam that I remember from my childhood. This just tastes like sugar. Very disappointing!!
5,INFORMATIVE,"If you want to know all there is to know about how we are living in a media world, this is the book for you. Are you aware of all the ways radio, TV, newspapers, magazines and movies impact our lives - every single day! Written in a clear style, with pictures to help in understanding, this is a book that will open your eyes."
1,A film buff's nightmare.........,"This is a comprehensive movie guide which contains over 19000 entries arranged in alphabetical order. Unfortunately, as according to Mr Maltin, these films get 2.5 stars - ""Shawshank Redemption"",""Amadeus"",""The Green Mile"" and ""The Usual Suspects"", the latter he finds ""convoluted"". ""The Shining"" gets 2 stars and ""Blade Runner"" gets 1.5 stars. On the contrary, ""Space Jam"" and ""Honey, I Blew Up the Kid"" got 3 stars each. This book is ludicrous! The only thing I liked about it was Mr Maltin's ability to encapsulate a film into a few sentences. Amazon's editorial review was absolutely correct - ""Maltin's is distinguished by the quality of its reviews""."
3,useful...,"This book's chief virtue lies in the number of reviews packed into its size. It is far from comprehensive, though --- woefully lacking in silents and foreign films. There are also a fair number of mistakes in it, and a few reviews that are downright imbecilic. That said, Maltin isn't a complete fool --- and once you get a feel for what he likes and dislikes, you can generally figure out from one of his reviews what you'll think of a film. Plus, there is some entertainment value to be had in some of the more ludicrous entries. I have a pretty exhaustive film library, but am happy to have this, simply as a matter of convenience. In this format, as far as I know, there simply isn't a better reference --- not to say that there couldn't be one sometime in the future. The guide to various actors films in the back is pretty useless, though. You're not going to find listings for any but the very most famous actors of the past 30 years here."
1,"If you know, how much I hate this guy...","This film critic is the worst film critic that has ever existed, none of his review's look positive, the top rating, i have ever seen on his books, has been just three stars, if you really want a film critic check out Roger Ebert,or a movie guide called ""doghound"" or something like that, also i criticize Maltin,m for being stupid, he puts such sillines for exapmle in the ""Mission to Mars"" review, he said ""DUH!, UBI UBTHISUBU UBA A UBUDRU UBUPEPPER, UBUGOOD,DUH!"", oh my god, he is so stupid and lots of other things that I don't want to mention."
2,Just as bad as Ebert at reviewing movies,"The fact that Maltin didnt particularly care for Forrest Gump shows that this guy should not be published. Go rent a movie and use your own judgment, and dont rely on someone else's criticism, because after all, all that counts is you like a film and not whether or not someone who gets paid to review movies does or not."
1,It's Amazing!!!,Wow. He has NO CLUE as to what he's babbling about. None Whatsoever! He rates things poorly and puts them down for absolutely no reason. It's incredible! I didn't realize anyone could possibly be this incompetent in ANY profession. Put simply: He sucks! He really does suck!
1,One start is too good,"This guy makes Gene Shallot look like he knows what he is talking about. Others have reviewed this book and cited glaring inonsistancies. The fact is that there is film and movies and Mr. Maltin does a fine job rating Movies and Video's as the title suggest. For the rest of us, we'll have to do it the old fashion way; catch the reviews from the film festivals and publications we trust. Mr. Maltins book has a place in many homes right next to the lazy boy, TV, and recliner."
1,Terrible- Maltin is awful,"When you seen enough 5 star ratings by the general public that are given 3 star ratings by Maltin, you come to realize that he is either bitter, casually interested in his job or is cribbing from another persons work. What a waste of money and time."
3,Can't get past one thing...,"I'm trying to get over the page that says something like, ""A cowboy comes up to you and says, 'Would you like me to shoot you in the head?'"" I'm sure no one batted an eyelash when I was a kid and we were reading this book, and look at me...I turned out fine, and have never shot anyone in the head, or anywhere else, for that matter. Still, I'm pretty sure that this is one gift that isn't going to make it under the Christmas tree. If you don't have a hang-up over that one page, then it's super-cute."
1,Very violent!,"If you love children, DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK. The first episode is about how to accept gifts from strangers, the second is about thanking a knight for cutting off a dragon's head (graphically!), and worst of all, the third is about a cowboy with a gun who asks a child ""Would like me to shoot a hole in your head?""I usually preview books at the library before buying, but this was recommended by a Childcare Magazine. Did they even read it?"
5,one of my favourite and worn-out cookbooks,"This was one of the first cookbooks that I extensively used. I loved it. Simple, foolproof recipes and very Shabbesddik. With this book in hand, it is easy to plan good Shabbatmeals that will go down well with guests at the table."
3,You don't have to act like I'm an idiot...,"I was expecting this to cover the basics, and it did... condescendingly. There are also some errors I noticed from my server experience, such as how to cut lemon wedges. It made me wary of the accuracy of the rest of it. I got this to help me get promoted to bartend... It did have some basics I could use, and a lot of drink recipes, but I could have gotten everything online. Probably the most useful will be the drink recipes because it has a lot without going overboard. They are listed by alcohol, and there is an alphabetical index at the end."
4,Solid Thoughts on this new Movement,"This is a wonderful resource for anyone interested understanding the role of Apostle and Prophet. These special offices of the church have been ignored, abused and mostly mis-understood. This is a great book to start a thorough biblical and contemporary study on the topic. C. Peter Wagner's understanding of scripture, expert opinion of Church Growth and personal experience are great resources on this vital topic. It should not be viewed as exhaustive but as the thoughts and understanding of one of the best thinkers in the evangelical church world today"
1,False advertising,I agree with the previous review - it is completely incompatible with the Peg Perego infant car seat. I bought it online and received it today. Now I have to go to BRU and return it - shipping costs down the drain.
4,cute timer,"This timer is very cute and looks like a sand timer. It works very well as a timer. I have not been able to get the clock feature to work but I bought it as a timer, and it works."
2,A Dreadful Bore,"I tried to get through this book. It took me about three weeks to get to page one hundred. The format was a mess. It was supposed to be the collected documents of the main character. This format just made reading the book a chore. After a while I found it difficult to keep the characters straight and just found myself dreading the idea of reading it. This could have been a good 400 page novel, but the author tried too hard to be clever and it ruined the impact. I wish I had the patience of the reviewers that finished The Wall because it is about a subject that I am very interested in; but it was just too boring for me to continue."
3,Have to Agree,"I have to agree with some of the other reviewers here. Many of the card images are pixelated.I bought a tarot deck mainly for research purposes and I chose this one because it seemed highly recognized and regarded -- and, from the samples, I thought the pictures were wonderful.However, not all the cards have the same quality art as others. I am not sure why that is. I am not talking about pixelation here I am talking about the actual drawings. Some are excellent, while some look very sloppily drawn. Not sure if Godfrey Dowson got tired after a while or what.Anyway, the price was perfect so I really cannot complain too much."
5,Timeless,"Johanna Spyri is one of the best authors of children books - Heidi is her best known book but all her books deal with children, their difficulties at a young age and the right attitude to take. The books have all a deep spiritual side as well and do not necessarily end as expected. Highly recommend any of her books."
4,I would recommend it to my friends.,"I was compelled to read The Chase in two sittings. Because I am familiar with the Lake Geneva and Door County locale, I especially appreciated the descriptions of the settings. I did not feel that Jill was unlikeable; however, I was surprised that she would be ready for a new love after being so recently burned. Pearl was well delineated, always putting a positive face on her life as women of her generation so often did. The adoption ring and Mr. Lewis' involvement in it did not seem like a stretch at all. A recent People magazine article told of just such a scheme. I liked the quotations at the beginning of each chapter. I usually don't read in the Christian romance genre, but I will recommend this book to my friends."
4,More synthetic brilliance of Sweden,"This C.D. is really cool. I popped it into my car stereo after a music festival and began the drive home. I was going on a max of 4 hours sleep, but the energy of this release sustained me the whole trip home. The really brilliant thing about this band is that the vocalist lends a distinctive style that makes Rupesh Cartel instantly recognizeable. To try to describe it is difficult, but his voice has a gravelly quality that complements the sheen of the electronics very well. This is not to say the programming is lackluster. The airy, white noise lead that opens the first track is unique and indicative of the brilliance to come. Just buy the c.d., or at very least check out the downloads, and prrepare for something fresh."
3,Sweet scent,Good price for the size of it...I recommended to my girlfriend too....I like the scent..It last long if you spray on your clothes.
1,"Bad,bad!",I have purchased this in the past with no problem but this time it had a strong acohol smell when first sprayed when that smell disapated there was no fragrance left??? Horrible I will return it was I can find some extra time. This also happened to be a valentines present to myself ! No stars
5,great,"Larry is an extremely experienced and mature mediation teacher. He understands meditation to be a whole life activity, a way to understand being a human -- the way to make sense out of our lives. This book is the result of many years of teaching students how to develop a Buddhist practice which is almost non-sectarian in it's simplicity. Finally his teachings are in book form, long overdue. Now more students can benifit from his wisdom."
5,Outstanding book on insight meditation,"This is a superb book on the Buddha's instructions on mindfulness of breath, body, emotions and mind, the foundations to build insight into impermanence and interdependence. If you read nothing else on Buddhist meditation, read this book. The practice outlined is certainly transformative; the author's writing and reflections are profoundly transformative as well. You'll want to read it again once you finish."
1,This book does not fufill its purpose,"This book is supposed to be about meditation. However he barely discusses meditation. He babbles about his stories and his philosophy. The people reading this book want to learn about meditation, not a person's life and philosophy. I was disgusted by this book. What a waste of time and money."
3,Not 5-mile GMRS,"This listing is incorrect. These are 1/2 watt, 2-mile units,even in GMRS mode. The description says 5 miles in GMRS mode.I returned the units untested when I learned this."
4,Nice product for the money,"I picked up a pair of these and they seem to be pretty nice radios for the money. The subcodes are compatible with the Motorola, and the range similar to other FRS products. I have never tested GMRS range. The weather alert is a nice feature. I have a couple issues with the product, the volume is too low, which is offset by having the mic gain too high, so the radio works well with its pair, but people other brands of radios may not be very loud, and others brands may have trouble understanding you when you speak 1 inch from the mic (speak further away). Also the squelch release is slower than Motorolas and Kenwoods, so the first thing people say may get cut off. Still not a bad radio for the price."
3,Zoe Trilling is all the money!,"Tobe Hooper's Night Terrors is a low budget horror film with a few pinches of nudity (the scenes with ""Genie"" played by Zoe Trilling and ""Sabina"" played by Alona Kimhi are particularly good!).In short, the dialogues are very poor, the plot and the setting are pretty good, and the special effects are average, while the acting is below average with William Finley's performance being pathetic. Moreover, Robert Englund does a much better job as Marquis De Sade than as Paul Chevalier. In addition, it was interesting, though not that surprising, to see Zachi Noy from the Lemon Popsicle series, since the film was shot in Israel.The movie could have been more graphic, but it seems that the director was holding back for some reason.Nevertheless, what with the horror and the sexy scenes, and as far as B-movies are concerned, the film is decent.Overall, far from being a masterpiece, it just might provide for an evening's entertainment if in a really silly mood and/or intoxicated."
3,"an oppion of ""Night Terrors""","This was a decent movie. I think Robert Englund fans will be dissapointed, but William Finlay fans ought to like it. A decent movie with some delving into the past of S&M ie Marquis De Sade"
3,Okay for a new parent,"This book is a little dated and a lot of the info and ideas are fairly obvious. As a first-time parent, I did find some of it useful as far as having an idea of what stages where coming up and what to expect, and a few of the play ideas were useful. For a total newbie it's okay, but I don't think it would be very useful for someone on their second kid or someone who has spent a lot of time with babies."
2,Not much new here,Ragnar Benson is at his best when giving practical advise mixed with pragmatic philosophy. This book unfortunately has little in the way of practical advise or thought provoking ideas. Much is a rehash of earlier work.
2,"Warms, but not good for ""very personal"" use","KY Warming liquid does what it promises, it moderately warms up on contact with skin. However, what the manufacturers don't warn you is that it contains Honey. This makes it somewhat sweet tasting, but not good for women's very sensitive areas. Anything sugary can wreak havoc on the delicate chemical balance of the vagina. This can even lead to infections, so beware! It also gets quite sticky after prolonged use, so overall I give this product only 2 stars."
1,"sticky, irritating, and not much librication","This is the most awful lubricant I have ever used. I have even received complaints including ""itching"" the next day - must be the honey!Anyway, stay away from this stuff unless you want to move your love making activities from two people to one."
3,good if used for the right purpose,"Warm is about the best way to describe this product. Like the poster above me stated, this isn't good for the ol root canal, though it can be used anywhere else. This is probably best used for greasing up before you hit the hersey highway, as well as for when Rosey Palm and her sisters come over for a visit.. Overall, I'd say that there are better things out there than this."
4,Devo review,"Great service and so far I am really enjoying this devotional! Quick messages that you can get through before work, yet they really get you thinking!"
1,Vinotemp V-60 Frozenwine cooler,"Purchased the Vinotemp VT-60 for storage of my expensive red wines. Plugged the unit in and could not get the temp setting to adjust to the desired tempeture. I noted that the display panel read ""LL"". Could not find any info regarding this reading and could not get the unit to adjust. I stuck a $40.00 bottle of wine inside overnight. The next morning I found the bottle to be frozen to the touch. I checked reviews on the unit and found that other customers have had the same problems. Thank God I did not put my prized bottles in the unit. I am returning the unit first thing Monday morning. Caution when buying Vinotemp wine coolers."
3,Withholding udgement,"Swift shipping. For all the hype I was surprised at the ""Kinko's"" type of publishing. Bargain basement for what I was led on online marketing ploy. That said, The content is excellent. Follow the professor's bluepront and getting published looks more likely. I'll ""buy that."" hmmmm, I did, didn't I? It was worth it."
1,Not Impressed,I was not impressed with this book and would not recommend it. It did not help me or steer me in the right direction.
1,Do Not recommend,I have been using this product for three months now and I don't see any results. The bottle does not last long being it contains 60 pills and you have to drink 8 pills a day. This is ridicules we are all better off using Nuro- PS Gold by vitamin world. The only reason I tried focus factor was because I did not have enough money to purchase the bottle from vitamin world at 50.00 dollars a bottle. I highly recommend those instead. I will never buy focus factor again.
1,2 bottles? Yeah right...,"This product is really good, but I'm not reviewing about the product. When I ordered this product, I bought it in pack of 2 bottles. Result? I got only 1 bottle instead of 2. This is a scam. Watch out."
1,Horrible Headache,"I bought this today from my local CVS. I took one pill this morning with breakfast (I'm only 94lbs, so the huge doses scared me). After a few minutes I started to feel anxious, like I had too much coffee. I couldn't sit through Church or focus on what the preacher was talking about. I've had a dull headache around my temple area, and a ton of pressure behind my eyes all day. I will give it a few more tries, but I don't think it helped me focus at all, if anything, the side effects made my focus worse than normal."
1,written by math professors for math professors,"I am taking a differential equations course for the engineering program at Drexel University and I must say that this is one of the worst text books I have ever come across. I wonder what Boyce and Diprima were smoking as they were writting this book. First of all make sure you brush up on your greek before reading this book, there are more greek symbols in it then there are numbers or letters from the english alphabet. This book is so vague that you may as well consult a magic 8-ball for guidance. Basically, if you buy this book, prepare to fail. It skips so many steps its rediculous. My mind turns to mush every time I open it. For my homework in this course using this book, I just write the giberish my magic 8 ball tells me to. Even the TAs are lost in this book. Consider this a warning and not a rating. STAY AWAY!"
3,Ok textbook.,"The textbook it alright, but I have had better experiences with other math textbooks. This one doesn't explain concepts well for my style of learning."
1,Very poorly written,"I don't have much to say that hasn't already been said, but I felt it important enough to pipe in and agree with most of the negative comments. The book is unnecessarily complicated, skips non-obvious steps in the examples, provides no review for material that justifiably should be reviewed, and has a very poor approach to explanation of concepts. Contrasted to James Stewart's Calculus book that I've used for the past year, this book almost makes me want to cry and turn into an English major. The key to surviving a class that requires this book is to get another book. I'm a Berkeley student, for whatever that's worth."
3,Not for everyone,"This was not what I thought it would be. I was looking for a program that would shouw some of the religious sites in the Old City. This does not contain any of such sites. what made matters worse is that when I contacted the supplier to inquire about other programs, no one ever responded to me. I would give 3 stars for the program and only 1 star because of the poor service."
4,"At last, one remote for all devices","I just received my Harmony 720 yesterday. From the time it was connected to my PC to using it to control my entire system totalled about 15 minutes. No pointing remotes at each other, paging through lists of device codes, and no trial and error. This controls every one of my components. One button to watch a DVD, listen to music, watch television, and play video games. The button labels are intuitive. I lost no functionality for any of my other 5 remotes. I can't believe I waited until now to buy one of these. I think even the most nontechnical person could use this remote. Some of the buttons are very small and it is a bit clumsy to use with one hand."
2,Warning,"I bought this because of all the great reviews and I am very disappointed. This is only for gadget geeks as it takes at least two hours to program it and even then none of it worked properly. For example, my new Sony HDTV is listed on their list, but not an option for the HDMI input needed for a DVD. Therefore, when using the DVD I have to pull out my old TV remote and switch inputs. The software you use is archaic and confusing and the unit itself has a cheap feel, not what you'd expect for $200. Mine is on it's way back."
2,Set up is time consuming,"Set up can take longer than I would expect. I would have expected the remote to accept all of the functions of the individual remotes but it does not. It was even a standard Sony tv that doesn't make the link. Once it is set up, it is difficult to change the original settings."
3,Logitech Harmony 720 Universal Remote,"Even thought the remote works as advertised, I do not like the little buttons. You can also get the thing out of sync if you turn on the device (TV, stereo) using another remote and then try to use this one. All in all I am not very happy with the decision..."
5,Great Read,"Another great work for a great author. Radclyffe continues to hold my interest with well-developed characters, interesting story lines and well written prose. Another great read!"
3,Okay,"I wasn't impressed. It was okay and a fun read, but all too predictable and fast. Despite creative lives the characters had I never really saw them as 3-dimensional. Not a lot of time was spent developing them, but rather telling us what their pasts were."
2,It's Too Slow,I'm not proud to be a slower reader than most but I have to recommend this only for the faster readers out there. It's very slow paced type of story. Even with the bits of scary in it; they are few & far between. But it does keep you wondering until the end what really is going on.
5,Fantastic buy! Really works well,"Used it to swap coil springs on my Jeep TJ....Made job go super fast and totally safe...didn't even have to jack up my Jeep....Very well designed, and high quality materials at a great price."
1,Horrible,"We bought the chavet bubble machine, and we also ordered this bubble fluid, We started to use this on my six year old son's birthday It was sad to say the least, very few bubbles and sometimes none at all. One of my freinds at the party said to empty out the bubble fluid and replace it with baby shampoo. It worked beautiful big bubbles and a constant stream. our ADVICE is to NOT BUY this product."
5,Mythmaker indeed!,Skinny Puppy does it again & releases another slab of industrial bliss. I admit it took awhile to grow on me but once this album sinks its claws in it never lets go. Fantastic head phone music!
4,Eh,The first four track reminscent of classic SP. the rest tepid and made me wonder who I was listening to
3,A very non-essential album..such a shame,"I cannot believe I have to cast aspersions, but this album is merely ok.It's biggest flaw is that it feels lacking in passion, it has no spark.This is largely due to the fact it feels like a watered-down OhGr album, the songs here have no sonic rememblence to Skinny Puppy's signature angst.Buy ""The Process"" instead, or trust the other reviews. Brap out."
2,Does it really take Butane fuel?,"Its always fun to own a Zippo. I am not sure though that the description ""uses butane fuel"" is accurate. Its not airtight enough. Flares up! Its neat, cause it burns much too quickly to cause serious injury (although it most definitely could). I'm new to these lighters, so I am not sure if what I am doing something wrong (overfilling, for instance), but after flaring up, the wick stops lighting up even though the flint creates a spark."
1,Did not light,"I like how the lighter looks and all, but I was disappointed when I recieved the item, because it wouldn't light. The flit works just fine, it just wouldn't create a flame."
3,good but not perfect,"you get exactly what you pay for, a simple zippo lighter in the box brand new. It does not come with fluid you will have to buy that separately (I've ordered some fluid from amazon, review coming shortly) but you cant mark it down for not coming with fluid because it says it doesn't. its a good basic zippo that i recommend to anyone who wants a zippo but doesn't quite want to pay a small fortune for the high end zippos on the market, i recommend this to anyone new to zippos, overall really great product.Now for the downsides, sometimes when in my pocket whilst on the move the insert comes out slightly this is terribly annoying as i keep having to pop it back in, also i noticed on the inside of the case there are yellow stains, not sure if thats with all zippo lighters or not.comes in a really nice black box to store and display the lighter, comes with a small booklet with info on zippos"
5,encendedores very good,los encendedores estan en muy buen estado y muy chevere aunque lo unico esque no tenian aunquesea un poquito de gas para aunque sea se enciendan
1,Ehh..,I got this hoping it would be good. I only used it 3 times and it just stopped working and I don't know what to do.
2,redundant,"i expected a man that spent virtually 20 hours a day for 15 years with fs to have a little more insight than recounting how many broads he a)slept with b)wanted to sleep with c)could've slept with but didn't (not many) or d) compared to ava gardner. oh, and don't forget about how much he loved being ""connected""...it's stated here about a thousand times. if you're a big fan of mr.s there's not much here you didn't already know...he was egotistic, shallow, insecure, rude, childish...and had a great voice. basically every trait needed to become a huge star. not that the author didn't love him..he did. this book won't make you feel any different about francis albert...i just expected less foolish, redundant gossip and a little more insight on things we didn't know about the man. by page 50 i was hoping for more than just mr.s' conquests....it never happened. do yourself a favor and stick to listening to the voice, instead of reading about him."
4,Surpringly relevant,"We all know Frank Sinatra did some interesting stuff. The author, George Jacobs, was his valet from 1953 to 1968, so he saw quite a bit of it. With honesty, brevity and wit, he tells us about it. Right out of the ""truth is stranger than fiction"" department. I saw a number of celebrities I recognized in here, and it was interesting to see them off camera. I saw a number of celebrities in here that I've never heard of, and they were interesting too. I think that latter point matters for readers who may perhaps be too young to remember when Frank was doing it his way. I also feel that I've stumbled onto a portrait of a time and place that I needed to see. It's a great book, not just a tell-all gossipfest. Oh, it has that too, but it's better somehow."
5,ASTOUNDING!,"In my opinion, Sondheim's best ever! Not only is the music waonderful, but for ther first time ever, fairy-tale characters are given a personality, un-like in disney where everyone is perfect. It has a valuble lesson in the second half, while exploring just exactly what 'happily ever after' is. Peters, Ferland, Wright, Zein Gleeson, and every other person in the cast plays their part to perfection!"
3,A couple of high voltage metal-industrial tunes.,"The best songs on this album are Find myself, let us prey, the new shout, anybody out there,flush and generation swine. the rest of the songs are weak in my opinion.The songs find myself and Prey are industrial-heavy metal thunder. It sounds like a mix of NINE INCH NAILS, METALLICA AND Zombie. If u do not like the above bands then this album is not for you.All in all this is an experimental album."
2,Book Condition,The book was very informative about the Lamaze technique and what to expect during labor. But the condition of the book was very poor
1,Inaccurate,"In my point of view, I think that the book Aruna's Journeys wasn't the best book I've read. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone in particular because the way it was thought out was showing ways that what the author thought was how all Indian Americans acted when talking about their culture. When Aruna says that she's different than her classmates, I find that true, but I don't mind that I'm different, unlike Aruna who wants to change the way she looks so she can fit in. I was born here in America, but I still visit India every two years and I celebrate my culture whenever I can. If a teacher or one of my friends asks me about India, I can answer without feeling guilty about it or feeling out of place. Aruna always feels uncomfortable when she's asked questions about India. So in the end, I don't feel awkward when someone asks me about India, and I like to celebrate my culture."
5,"""could you want more ~ Motley Crue""","This double compact disc package from Hip-O Records is a collectors dream ~ ""New Tattoo"", featuring Vince Neil (vocals), Mick Mars (guitar), Nikki Sixx (bass), Randy Castillo (drums) and Samantha Maloney (drums). No doubt, no holds barred will give fans everything they ever wanted from Motley Crue...and much, much more. Just take a gander at ""HELL ON HIGH HEELS"", the enhanced video that will take you right up on stage with the Crue. Bonus disc recorded live in Salt Lake City takes you to another level with ""KICKSTART MY HEART"", ""SAME OL' SITUATION"", ""DR. FEELGOOD"", ""HELL ON HIGH HEELS"", ""LIVE WIRE"" and ""WHITE PUNKS ON DOPE"", now what more could you ask for.Total: 2-CD-Set ~ Hip-O Records 440-067-644-2 ~ (4/08/2003)"
1,What the..?,"I just can't get into this CD. After the more experimental ""Motley Crue"" and ""Generation Swine"", this one's a bit of a disappointment. The lyrics are dull, and the band sounds like it's had the life sucked out of it. Even Mick's solos, normally a high point on any Crue CD, sound flat. I was excited when I saw that Randy Castillo was drumming, but, as talented as he was, even he couldn't save this album. ""Punched In The Teeth By Love"" is the only song with any life to it; it sounds like classic Motley. If this had been the follow-up to ""Dr. Feelgood"" or if it had come out instead, I might have liked it better."
1,Only 3/4 Motley Crue,this is not motley crue without tommy lee. And...has anybody noticed that Vince Neil cannot sing to save his life? It's only been like that for 19 years!
1,Man this blows,"They started out like the old Crue, but totally lost it after ""Hell on High Heels"". They just didn't have the same old Crue energy like ""Dr. Feelgood"" or any albums before. It's time to move on fellas."
4,"Great, but not the greatest","To be honest,I was a little worried that this cd would be the fatal downfall of Motley Crue. Fortunatlly, it wasn't, it was quite the oposite. This cd is excellent and a must have for any Motley Crue fan. Randy Castello is a great substiution for Tommy Lee and the rest of the Crue shines as they always have. Songs like HELL ON HIGH HEELS and PUNCHED IN THE TEETH BY LOVE prove Motley still has the potential they had back in the 80s. The only reason I gave this only 4 stars was because it wasn't as good as classics like Shout at the Devil and Dr. Feelgood. Still, your Motley Crue collection isn't complete without this cd."
3,Only 11 Tracks of Average,"First, There is no track ""Timebomb"" on the CD. There are only 11 songs. Compared to Generation Swine, Motley Crue's self titled '94 release and the new tracks on their Greatest Hits CD, this CD feels like a step backwards. Maybe that was the intent. There are not many catchy choruses or interesting guitar sounds like on ""Generation Swine"". I also think Vince's voice sounds a lot less crisp than on his best albums (Theatre of Pain through Generation Swine). If you are a MC fan you will probably want this to round out your collection, it is after all, the first complete studio album in 4 years. If you are looking for something that is the result of a progression of the Crue's music over the last 10 years, search elsewhere. I thought these songs were average."
3,Motley Crue - 'New Tattoo' (Beyond Records) 3 1/2 stars,"Decent 2000 effort,the Crue's eighth album.Drummer Tommy Lee is replaced here with veteran skinsman Randy Castillo(Ozzy,Lita Ford-R.I.P.).Thought this release was rather comparable with 'Dr.Feelgood',but a tad BETTER.Mostly because the guys make a full effort to return to their rock&sleaze roots.Best tracks include ""Hell On High Heels"",""She Needs Rock&Roll"",""Punched In The Teeth With Love"" and their unlikely cover of The Tube's ""White Punks On Dope"".Do check this one out."
1,Not Worth It,"As you have probably read in about 90% of the reviews posted, this book has very little to offer. There isn't even a hint of a ""step-by-step"" guide to building a website found anywhere in the book. Instead, the author continually states the obvious chapter after chapter by going over each menu item and what it means. Do you really need the author to tell you to place the title of your page or module in the box marked Title???? For modules and components, it explains what they are but does not offer one line of text on either telling you how to use them. I can go on and on, but to make a long story short save your money. Simply stated it is a pitiful excuse for a development guide and does nothing to live up to the title. There isn't a thing in the book you can't get from the available online Joomla! manual or from just plain common sense. Pretty worthless."
1,Terrible book,Please don't waste your money on this product. It just explains the basic template...What a rip-off!
3,How Capt. Chicken Won the War,"I found myself physically ill after a good three quarters of the entries in the book, and strangely inspired by the rest. The vocabulary ideas are excellent. But in general I veiwed it as a cop out. The moment I put this sissy-aid of a book back in the library returns I missed it, and wished I had to to look through every once in a while. It is now reserved by some women in suburbs for the rest of the mammals' domination of the planet, and I am forced to spent honestly earned dollars on it.In afterthought, the book does get the ball rolling in certain situations. I don't write romance, therefore some of the entries and ideas are too overly dramatic for my use, but it does get the ball rolling in terms of sentence structure and word choice."
3,Good descriptions but expected more,I'm an avid romance reader and am looking into trying my hand at writing romance. I brought this book on recommendation. Usueful tips but I expected more texts. It's filled with lots of useful phrases to inspire creativity. Overall it's okay.
5,A Must for Romance Writers,"Awesome reference guide for all things a writer gets stuck with; a guy can only rake his hands through his hair so many times before the reader gets bored. Lots of examples of how to write emotions and expressions. Tons of better ways to write he said, she said. Pick it up today; you won't be disappointed."
5,So Cute! Bragging rights for the Big Bro!,"My nephew looked so cute, and wore this proudly to the hospital when his new baby sister arrived! Nice bright colors and thick quality cotton too!"
2,Ridiculous Book,"A few things about this book 1) Its tiresome. The author goes on and on and on (and on) about how wonderful of a person Leslie Van Houten has become. In fact, Ms. Van Houten does sound like a fine person, but the author's reverence towards her is hard to stomach and it makes the book hard to take seriously. 2) The political yammerings are also offputting. The author makes it sound as if all of society is corrupt, chaotic, and illogical..."
3,"Third base, maybe","I have read the bulk of Lovecraft, but missed out on this title. Photography and art direction are wonderful, followed closely by mood. The pace can lag at times and crab claw monsters decked out in what appear to be propellers from beanie caps will NEVER trouble my sleep as they were intended to do. When this production company can have something huge slide down the hills of Arkham, they will regain my attention. Until then, I will have to be content with the near brilliant THE CALL OF CTHULHU and forever regret that this picture, literally and figuratively, crashes in the end."
5,What is the Big H? HUMOR!,"When I first purchased this book, I thought it would be a fun read and one I could pick up and sit down, at my leisure. NOT. This book is so funny that you barely get over one giggle before another one hits you! Read it at home, not in public. People will stare.I have to ask the author...did these things REALLY happen? The commode lid scene in the hospital had me bent over double laughing! I love this book and am so happy it was recommended to me. I STILL pull it down from ""it's place"" on my bookshelf and re-read a bit, just for a lift. Don't miss it. You'll be sorry you did...and get your own copy. That way, you can read it over and over.Hey does anyone know if there will be another book?"
3,Tom's book review,"In this book, Leon's story, it is about a young man named Leon. He was a colored boy who grew up in the times of slavery. Leon has to learn how to act around others of another race so he doesn't get himself in any trouble. Leon also has to learn how to hide from the ku-klux-klan. The most important and shocking part of this book happened on Leon's 15 birthday. On this day Leon's parents go to the store and on their return they are approched by a group of three young white boys driving in their car, the outcome of this is not very good. Most of this book was written in a way so that it was like the author was actually speaking to you person to person. This was a pretty interesting book and if I had to I would probably read it again."
1,Yuck,"Watched this movie with my 4-year old not knowing it was a series for older girls. We streamed it thinking, Awe innocent fairys! This is a perfect example of, DO YOUR RESEARCH. Completely inappropriate for a 4-year old."
1,Absolute crap,Horrible storyline. The movie was all about spells and wizards and powers. And not in a positive or light-hearted way. I thought it was wayyyy too intense for my 4 year old daughter.
5,winx club,I really liked this movie I like watching the winx club on tv so i thought I would like the movie to that is why I bought it.
2,Faster isn't Necessarily Better for the Child,"I ordered this book because I was told the techniques result in toilet training quickly. I was unprepared for methods which I consider primitive (i.e. giving children suppositories to loosen their stool (which my pediatrician says is invasive and unhealthy); or having young children change their own soiled sheets AND waking them every few minutes for extended periods throughout the night).Gee whiz, I wouldn't want this done to me. It sounds a bit more like brain-washing than toilet training. Just because something works, does not make it civil. This book does not treat children with respect but rather like pets to be trained in order not to inconvenience the owners."
5,"help, why?",i love this game..But... why didnt you make it on windows xp? its not fair!!!! im so angry.. you know i used to have windows like hp.. and stuff.. but now i have windows xp.. i need windows xp!!
2,Disapointing,"Well written. In fact too well written. When I found out at the end, though it is BASED on a real story, it was a pastiche of many forward air controllers and the final meeting is total fiction, I was disgusted. The 'Hollywood treatment' triumphs over reality, again."
4,A pilot evading the Viet Cong and NVA.,"This is a nice little adventure story. It is about a pilot who was shot down over Northern South Vietnam during the NVA invasion of 1972. Gene Hambleton was a 53 year old navigator for an electronics aircraft. When he landed, he was smack dab in the middle of a huge concentration of NVA troops. One survelliance airplane and a rescue copter were shot down trying to retrieve him. During the course of his two week ordeal, he managed to evade capture even though he had little food and water. His story is an inspiration for those who had to deal with hardships. His rescue involved an imaginary golf course so that he could work through the enemy soldiers surrounding him.This is a nice little read, even though at times the writing sounds a little corny. I read this in less than a day. Gene Hambleton was a hero. I remember the movie starring Gene Hackman, and wish I could view that again and how it relates to the book."
3,"Sometimes Useful, Always Dry","I agree with most of the reviews here that the book contains some useful approaches to screenwriting beyond the three-act orthodoxy.The writing, however, often distracts from the content.The structure of the book is disorganized and ad hoc to the extent that it encourages skimming rather than close study.Worse, however, is that the writing is often academic, sometimes theoretical, and always soul-less. The authors appear to want to curry favor with the their peers in the teachers lounge than educate students. Occasionally the writing is downright atrocious. The authors employ, for instance, the frightful alternating of ""he"" and ""she"" -- a surrender to politically correct pieties that permeate the work as a whole. Ironic for a book devoted to the spirit of independent writing."
3,Should've had 4 stars but....,"This was a pretty good read. It's a fairly effective combination: hard-edged ex-cop with a checkered past has to find his kidnapped daughter. Good stuff. Sort of like Dan Simmons' protagonist, Joe Kurtz, although not as misanthropic. If you like detective or cop stories you'll probably enjoy it. So why 3 stars and not 4? One complaint: our hero keeps losing his gun. Literally. He keeps getting clobbered (despite being armed) then disarmed, then pummeled. Once, okay. 2 or 3 times is too many. So, 3 stars."
5,Comprehensive.,The Best series of books to learn Network programming from. The BEST in the world. Nothing comes close.
2,Old wine in new bottle,"I did not see much difference between this and the previous edition written several years previously and before the crisis. Over this book, I strongly recommend Haley, Tan and Haley's ""New Asian Emperors: the Overseas Chinese, their Strategies and Competitive Advantages"" as an expert account of how to do business in Asia."
3,Fish Light,Works as advertised. I have hung it off my dock several times. For a while I left it submerged running on a timer with my 12 volt dock lights but sea life started growing on it so I pulled it out of the water. CONs they are not very bright.
2,A little too gourmet for me,I am currently in a supper swapping group. I thought these recipes looked a little too hard and a little too gourmet for the group that I am in. I would probably not use any of the recipes.
5,mary,I have used No Rinse Body Bath for years it works very well for my handicapped mother who cannot get into the tub.
4,GREAT SOUL ALBUM,"George Chandler & Jimmy Chambers of Londonbeat had worked with Paul Young, The royal family as well as Al Green and Tina Turner. But it was their own material, written and put together with 3rd vocalist Jimmy Helms and producer Willy M which highlighted their true potential. In The Blood is work of distinction which brims with verve and speaks of class. From the opening bars of the title track with its clever trumpet adding that extra touch, through Getcha Ya Ya to a respectable cover of Marley's No Woman No Cry, this album cannot be faulted. The organ orgs, the guitars guit and the harmonies blend and soar to create a crisp clarity and a superior soul album. Many of the songs here are better than the hit I've Been Thinking About You."
3,Not for some,"I can't recommend this book as an alternative to the Baltimore Catechism. They're very different. While it's probably great for personal reading, I wouldn't suggest it as a teaching resource. It's pretty wordy and may not be suitable for all environments such as a CCD class where attention spans tend to be short."
1,Poor quality,"First off let me say the packaging was horrible, a large box with 7 of these in them with zero padding. Of course they were damaged.Second, I unwrapped one that appeared not to be damaged, moved the vent blades and the blades fell off.I did not bother to unwrap any others. Set up to return within 15 minutes of receiving items.Glad other reviewers had better luck."
5,Imperial Registers,"We are remodeling our home and bought these registers to replace the scratched up vents in every room. We bought these because the price was right and the almond and brown colors matched our flooring well. They are nicely painted, arrived in a few days and were well packaged. Surprisingly these are made in Canada not overseas which was an additional plus."
5,Full of detail and suspense,"Though based in one city, this book depicts the struggles and choices black men have made to take care of their families in america. The writer gave excellent detail which allowed me to visualize everything I read. I enjoy murder mysteries and this ranks with the best.This is an exceptional novel from a gifted writer. Walter Mosley would be proud!"
2,?,"I decided to read these book because of the positive reviews I had read on Amazon.Sincerely,I couldn't understand the book's meaning at all. I didn't rate 1 only because of Wolfe's good way of writing."
5,Great stuff!,"I really like this sunscreen. It's gentle enough to use on my face as well as on my body, and works very well.Darned shame that it was discontinued."
5,Family Favorites,"I've been a cookbook collector for years. This cookbook is full of delicious recipes that have become my family's favorites. There are recipes in here that I have had at potlucks and wanted to know how to make the dishes, like Caramel Apple Salad (amazing). My husband loves the Banana Split Dessert. The non-dessert recipes are great, too.I'm buying a copy of this cookbook to send to my Mom."
4,"Buggsy looks great, but will he last?","I bought Buggsy because my 5 month old grandson absolutely adores the caterpillar on Baby Einsteins. Buggsy was the closest thing I could find that looked like him. He loves Buggsy. Unfortunately, Buggsy is not made to withstand a great deal of play. He looks good now, but the stitching on him is already pulling apart a bit. Once my grandson is old enough to really play with toys I'm afraid Buggsy will not last. I am only hoping that he does not become his toy of choice (all my kids seemed to latch on to that one special toy)."
5,Anyone home?,"With this little gadget you'll be asking that a lot. Because the lights will be on! When you put the proper wires on the proper connectors on the switch and tuck it all back into the box and put the light cover on, you'll be pleasantly surprised and how easy and efficiently this little guy can turn a light on OR off. I would highly recommend this product, if your like me and frequently change your mind. Sometimes I'm an off kinda guy and then just a few minutes later, I can be an on kinda guy. This switch allows me to be me and that's what I love about it."
3,"Despite a small design flaw, I'd buy another","I received this as a Christmas gift and it worked great for a few months. Waffles, grilled cheese sandwiches, pancakes, meat, everything I cooked on here cooked quickly and evenly. The plates were also easy to clean afterwards.The only issue I had was that the oil I sprayed on the plates to prevent sticking (such as Pam) always dripped onto the bottom heating unit. It would burn and was *very* hard to clean. After several months it stopped working completely, probably due to the oil in the base.Still, I'd probably buy another because it cooks very well. My suggestion is just to be vigilant about cleaning up any oil that leaks underneath the plates."
5,Great Family Entertainment,"There is not much I can say that hasn't already been said about this series, but I will say this much.... it's nice to be able to watch a fantasy-based series the whole family can enjoy. I am especially pleased with the special effects which are simply fantastic given this is a made-for-tv film.I received a complimentary copy to review."
3,Bad Packaging = Damaged Discs,"The show is great, which those looking at this DVD set probably already know. The packaging of the discs is poor.I just got this set today, opened it, and one of the discs was loose in the package, scratched on back. The clips that hold in the discs are just half a circle, not a full circle like on a normal DVD case. This is so they can save money and squeeze 5 discs into less space. When I clip the damaged disc back in, it just falls out again. The clip is broken.I got Season 2 as well. Those were ok from what I can tell. But it has the same cheesy system to hold the discs in.I'm having to send this set back and try to get a replacement that isn't damaged. Amazon does try to make it as easy as they can to return something, which is a reason to buy only from Amazon and not other sellers. It's a hassle. But that's the risk you take buying something like this through mail order.So 5 stars for the show, 1 star for the bad packaging = 3 stars."
5,Merlin the complete First Season,I love Merlin. It's both funny and serious. The friendship between Merlin and Arthur is great. Waiting on season two.
5,A great family entertainment,"An excellent family based show with strong production values and a solid cast. I predict great things of the lead, Colin Morgan. Sufficiently deep to satisfy adult viewers and understandable for younger viewers, the plots are entertaining and fresh."
4,Delightful!,"After seeing season one and now following season two, I must say this series totally grows on you! It's entertaining, funny, romantic, dramatic and with plenty of actions! If you like arthurian legends or just a good medieval story, watch Merlin and you won't be disappointed! I can only hope the DVDs will soon be released in the USA!"
1,Junk,"I purchased one of these radios before Christmas and it works great. I decided I wanted another for work, so I ordered another one.I recived my radio a couple of days ago and had to send it back because the ""preset"" weather stations are off the mark and the only thing I can pick up is distorted and garbled. They sent me a replacement and it too is off station. At this point, I'm wondering if the first one I got was the exception. I do NOT reccomend this product unless you just want an am/fm radio, that part works great.This will be my last First Alert purchase unless I can try it out first!"
3,First Alert Nooa WX17 Portable emergency raido,I recevied the radio! It works with batteries but not when it is plugged into the the wall plug! I would of sent it back but I didn't want the hassie of paying postage! At least it does work with batteries! Carolyn!
3,Good but couldn't been better,"This play was typical Tyler Perry filled with lots of gospel music, secular jokes, and of course Madea.This story of two sisters, one engaged to the other's ex husband was interesting. Madea's interaction with both was heart warming considering her character.David Mann as Madea's next door neighbor Mr. Brown is hilarious as always.The disappointing aspect of this DVD for me is that after having seen several other Tyler Perry plays I noticed that he reused some of the same exact jokes in this DVD. Madea was funny as usual but she lacked many original lines."
5,I LOVE THIS MOVIE,I RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE ALONG WITH THE FDTV DVD. YOU WILL NOT BE DISSATISFIED. BUY A FEW FOR THE FAMILY ALSO. GOOD FOR THE WHOLE FAMILY.
3,Good switch but not really quiet...,"The switch is of an acceptable quality, however, we wanted a whisper quiet switch for a child's room. This switch makes a ""click"" sound when switched. With the word ""quiet"" in the description, we expected it would be similar to a traditional ""quiet"" switch that makes no sound when thrown. I'm not sure why ""quiet"" is in the description."
4,Nice change,"This was a good book, and a nice change from what I usually read - Nora Roberts. I almost gave up on this book because it started slow I thought - the reason for all the running around took a bit too long to unfold. The writing was very funny in many areas, and that was great. This was my first Justine Dare book, but I will definitely look for more."
4,Great movie great disk,"Wonderful dark comedy from Roger Corman. Hapless young man discovers a man-eating plant. Just as good as Corman's other horror comedy, A Bucket of Blood. This dvd release is quite nice and well worth the price."
1,wrong one,dissapointed was not what i wanted was looking for newr version this was an older one so just wasn't happy
4,Finally-a pretty good transfer of this underground classic.,"Having seen this little gem a number of times in copies that ranged from looking like the film was photographed through an ash bath to a print from Roger Corman's own collection, it is nice that we finally have this two-day quickie cult favorite available on home video in a version that not only looks as good as we will ever get, but also sounds terrific and (if you are desperate) even in a colorized version that really does not add much except the coloring for the plant is actually quite good. Definitely worth the purchase, and the price is quite affordable."
4,Play's are better,"This movie was good and I really enjoyed it, I thought that it was a delight!And hilarious, but my school put on a play earlier and it was a lot better than the movie... the movie cut out half the songs from the original play. I liked the music and the characters but it would have been better if both the people died at the nd like the play!"
5,"An excellent, suspenseful novel...","King Kelson of Gwynedd faces a war on two fronts: a Church led internal rebellion, and an invasion from a neighboring land; while covert forces loom in the background, in volume two of The Chronicles of the Dernyni, Deryni Checkmate. It is an excellent story, with complex plots and subplots. Treachery and intrigue abound, while courage and honor are put to the test. This is the cliffhanger that concludes in High Deryni. A definite must read..."
4,Great continuation of the story.,"I'm am sitting here wondering if those people who gave this book such a bad review even read it; or perhaps they didn't understand it. I will be the first to admit that it is not her best work ever done, but it is far from the worst book ever written either. This novel has quite a few unpleasant moments in it, but that is part of the story the author is trying to portray. how true to life would it seem if everything in all of the novels was always peaches and cream? I think Mrs. Kurtz is an amazing author because she is willing to write the bad events with the good. This novel is definately worth the read and highly recommended."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Kelson is now a young king. It takes pretty much zero time before he has problems with those annoying church wankers.An archbishop is up in arms, wanting one of the nobles to basically not be Deryni.Threats of excommunication, conflict, and running around ensue, as well as magical stuffups, executions, and outright battle. Not a good time for all, by any stretch."
2,Did someone get paid to design this?,"Don't get me wrong. It looks nice, the radio sounds fine, but who in the world would design a clock radio that shows the radio station you're tuned to NOT THE TIME?!! It's in my office and I listen to the radio, but I can't just glance up and see what time it is - no - that would be too easy. I have to turn the radio off so it will return to the time. Then I turn the radio back on so I can repeat the process ten minutes from now. The other reviewer gave a great list of other problems, but this was the one I found to be the worst. Audiovox - pull your head out!"
1,D-Link need improve their product quality,"Bought a D-LINK wireless router and D-LINK USB adapter. The hard wired LAN works but the wireless adapter can't connect to the router. After hanging on the phone with D-LINK support people for whole night, finally I gave up. I borrowed an Efficient Networks router to test the USB adapter, it works fine. Good luck to the people who want to buy D-LINK product. If works, go to buy lottery ticket."
1,This product is no good !!!,"This product is, at best, an engineering prototype. Do not buy this if you are not very well versed in computers.When this unit freezes, the only way to bring it back up is to connect a null modem cable, reset its ip address (192.168.0.1) and then reboot (via a terminal window).When my computer is connected to this, using an ethernet connection, if I were to unplug the connection this unit freezes.It is very unstable and this is with the firmware upgrade !Mine is on its way back to Amazon... VERY DISAPPOINTED..."
2,Works like a charm (except for wireless),"Initially, everything seemed to work fine. The firmware got upgraded and over the next several days. I fiddled with different variables trying to evaluate and optimize the performance. The unit would boot and connect at 11Mbs then over time the connection would degrade to 1Mbs. I was only 20 feet from the router!The radio seemed to drift and lose signal strength. Not being sure if it was my Netgear card in the laptop, or the router, I picked up the Linksys router to troubleshoot with. Unlike, the D-Link product, my range is better and the connection quality seems consistent at 11Mbs. All indications are that the D-Link transmitter is flaky.Take a guess which one is going back. It's a shame, because the D-Link product had a great price-point and feature set, but the number one feature, wireless, just didn't make the cut.Tom"
1,Kept waiting for something to happen and it never did,"Super slow movie. The reviews were very misleading and made it sound like it had a plot. A lot of time was spent zooming into the girls face and showing the natural setting which were beautiful. That is it, a lot of drawn out scennes were little happened and whatever did was very predictable. No, I did not like it, not one little bit."
5,exquisite,This is a movie with great characters ..... very nice views n a touching story... it is very romantic too I really did like this movie bcuz its got little bit of everything.... wat I will really like to know is if tomitche really died? Apart from that its a great movie...
1,Why I put this book down after 175 pages,"I don't know how people can say that this book was well-written. It reads like an encyclopedia. It's obvious that the authors are researchers first and writers second. The book would be great if the authors would be able to take the dense - though fantastic - historical accounts and weave them into an interesting story.I picked the book up after moving to the Rio Grande Valley from the East Coast, hoping to gain a better perspective of the area. Unfortunately, I will have to look elsewhere to gain that perspective."
3,Not deep or incredibly complex but still a fun read.,"I'll start by saying this book is really more of a 3.5/5 for me. 4 seems slightly too high but 3 seems too low for how much I enjoyed it. It wasn't masterfully written, the characters aren't incredibly complex, and the story definitely had it's small flaws BUT I really had fun reading it. It was definitely enjoyable and that has to be worth something when you're reviewing literature right?I guess in general it was slightly more juvenile writing than I normally read but I would still recommend this."
1,Don't get it?,"I can't for the life of me figure out how anyone can give this a positive review. Incredibly boring read. I just finished reading the First Law series, the Night Angel Trilogy, and the first book of the Kingkiller Chronicles. I'm not sure if these are all debuts but they are far more entertaining than this crap."
1,senoir reader,i got tired of using white-out to cover swear words and trying to figure what period of time the auther had this section of chapter. it is not a good book for it takes 10 pages to get any action but by then you are off to another time. go to a resale store and pay 50 cents for it for you'll end up tossing it out like i did after 200 pages of swear words and more to come.
4,Not the normal Fantasy,"This wasn't the normal fantasy story. No wandering the roads, delving into dungeons, or snarks. It's a rogues tale, ancient Oceans Eleven, and a good one. I loved the characters and got attached to them. My only problem was that I wish there was a little bit more warning when jumping back and forth, telling Locke's past and future, there was a couple of times where I was a few paragraphs in before I realized it wasn't the timeline I'd just been in. Other than that a good book."
4,Solid Book,"I thought this book was really fun to read. It had a ""Count of Monte Cristo"" type of feel, which was really interesting to read in a book in the fantasy genre. I would recommend it to anyone."
3,A disappointment in sci fi/fantasy,"I just didn't enjoy this book. I found it hard to get into, and the plot was not very good. Much ado about nothing to sum it up."
3,Meh.,"This book was relatively highly recommended for me and it appeared on the decade's top 10 list for Sci-Fi / Fantasy novels. It was, in a word, ""okay."" It was full of many instances of characters basically saying ""look how clever I'm being with my plan,"" and then carrying out said plan. And, truth be told, many of the plans were hairbrained."
1,Way too small,"If you don't mind eye strain these tiny little lines will take a lot of music notation. I got this same brand in a notebook, because it was all the music store had in stock. I tired it out and did not like it. I am now shopping for some music notation paper with big lines. Please consider that hand written notation is harder to read than mass produced notation. The color of this paper is also beige and not white or off white."
3,Not the Best of Lacan,"I love Lacan, and refer to him often in my own work in the Anthropology of Gender, but this particular book is rather befuddled and vague, and I would never submit my own students to it. It may be due to translation (sadly enough, I do not read French), but if you are interested in Lacan's approach to psychoanalysis, I suggest you read Ecrits, unless you are an intellectual masochist."
2,Slightly Confusing/Negative,"I have worked with these cards for a while now, and found them to be very negative. People do not want to hear the negativity that comes along with this particular deck. Also there is no corresponding book. There is, however, a little booklet that comes with the deck, but it is very general."
2,First three and then let it be!,"The First three songs rip and then it is on to the crapiest Arch Enemy has been since their last singer. If you likes the first two album that were any good then you will hate this one. Arch Enemy is melodic fast paced metal and Wages of Sin and Anthems of Rebellion were amazing and Doomsday Machine sucks. I am disappointed and am waiting for the next cd hopefully they will bounce back. The closest I could compare the crappiness of this cd would be when Metallica came out with St. Anger. The old Metallica fans hated it and now Metallica has a bunch of new fans that like the new sound which I think they sould have broken up instead of coming out with St. Anger. I will say one good thing about the cd and that is Nemesis is like the Arch Enemy of old and completly kicks ass. I suggest that anyone that wanted to metal it up should go pick up the new Trivium, As I Lay Dying or some Children of Bodom. Screw this cd."
2,Vo-Kills,"Good band, really bad vocals. It's almost as if they are playing a joke. Too bad, could have been a good album."
5,great album,"there's nothing to say, this is kick ass album, especialy the dynamic duo ammot btother, they has legacy to carry on of hetfield and hammet, mustaine and friedman, scolnick and peterson, and the legend is continue to ammot brother...its very very good album...."
5,Skull melting and melodic,"While I dislike most metal, my favorite bands tend to be heavier metal. As a long time musician, AE's technical skill really appeals to me while still being brutally heavy. This album seems to take a more experimental approach (for this genre), offering more for the discerning listener; more complex phrasings, more melodic interludes. Obviously this will turn off those seeking your basic heavy, 4-on-the-floor with chunky recto gallops, but if you're looking to try something much more interesting, that's somewhere between later Death (Sound of Perseverance) and, oh I don't know, Friedman-era Megadeth, definitely give this a listen."
3,DISSAPOINTED,I will admit I was a little dissapointed by this album. A lot of the songs are very slow and don't seem to have a lot of orginaility! Nemesis is probably the best single off this album. And I can see why the band made it their first single. This definitely doesn't compare to wages of sin. But some tracks are worth listening to but I don't really like the intro. BORING!!
3,Doomsday Machine,Doomsday Machine being Arch Enemies 6th studio album and their 2005 is a mix of melodic death metal andthrash metal. The booklet is quite busy like many death metal seem to be. It contains all the lyrics and also includes a list of whom plays what. Allmusic gave the album 3/5 in their review. I am inclined to give it 3.5 but since I can not and 4 is too high then I give it a strong 3/5. The album had some success with the public at large and reached #87 on the Billboard 200. 3/5.
3,Not what I was looking for,"If I had been able to see each month as it appears in the calendar I would have chosen another one. My overall impression is battle scenes and dark colors. I wanted space shots with exotic planets, moons, nebula. It's nicely done, just not what I wanted."
3,Depressing to me,"I pre-ordered this calendar with another item and now realize that I should have waited until I could have read reviews of it. I had no idea that it would be exclusively Original Series (TOS) art. I enjoy all the series, but TOS isn't my favourite, so I would have passed if I'd known this ahead of time. Furthermore, while I do enjoy CG at times all of these pictures are blatently computer generated.They aren't horrible pictures, they just do not have the visual crispness and clairty that I associate with Star Trek visual effects shots--they were clearly not commercially produced, but made by fans. Again, this isn't something necessarily very bad, but neither of these facts was advertised and so I feel quite cheated.If TOS is your favourite Star Trek series and you don't mind CG then go for it, you'll love this calendar. If however, you're looking for a mix of the generations and a bit higher quality then look elsewhere or perhaps wait for next year's offering."
1,"I'm disappointed. Some nice pictures, no calendar value whatsoever","The dates in this calendar are the smallest I've ever seen. Beside nice pictures of some Star trek ships, you can't use this in your office as you need a magnifying glass to recognize the dates.Moreover, there are 2 holes at the top of the calendar to hang it on the wall, but this means making an extra hole but the regular single hole that other calendars are using and that's not going to happen in my place.I consider this product a total FAIL."
3,Ill Have To Agree,id have to agree that this is useless as a calendar. So I have come to reality that this is just an awesome piece of artwork to hang on my wall and it really is. All pictures are just top notch.
5,Trekkie Hubby Loves it!,While my hubby prefers a desk calendar (not to be found anywhere this year) this calendar is his next choice for it's awesome imagery.
1,A less than interesting bunch of paper,"If I had to be honest mi words would be ""it's crap. period.""But I suppose you'd like to read a bit more about it. In fact I study History at the university and my speciality is Sumer so mesopotamia sounded interesting for me at the time I decided to purchase the book. When I finally received it at home I didn't even finish it cause it was just a regular collection of monsters dungeons traps and spells with changed names and trying to look hip. Not worked on me. You don't need this, just purchase a copy of the epic of gilgamesh an use names and stories from there to flavour your gaming."
1,Doesn't Live Up To The Reviews,"From the reviews and supposed reputation of Katchor I was expecting a thunderous resurgence of the graphic novel. It seems a shame that the glowing reviews it has garnered in no way reflect the sloppiness of the story or artwork. As a artform the graphic novel has been richly exploited in the fantasy world of comics. However as a mainstream novel method it has been largely ignored. But if employed with skill, as evidenced from Japanese authors, it can be a compelling format.However this book falls far short of that mark. The story is stock and uninteresting, and the characters and ending are sadly predictable.The only redeeming feature of the book is its binding. It is unfortunate, though, that every page the covers hold in place, lacks soul, skill, and imagination."
3,It works with Nero,"First of all, the drive would be recognized right away in Windows XP when plugged, so no need of driver (if any).It has not worked in Windows Explorer. I meant you could not drag things to the drive because the drive appeared as a DVD-RAM drive. It worked fine with Nero Essential 7.It made noise, but it burned fast a 4.7gb disc in about 9 minutes at a 8x speed. I have not tried its max speed yet."
3,eh......,"this was not at all what I was looking for. first, it can really only be used with a specific kind of pickup bed, and not any SUV or most other vehicles. Second, the bolts that come with are only enough to entirely attach EITHER the main bracket or 2 in the main bracket, 2 in the support bracket. This would mean the main bracket's strength is compromised. This was easy enough to return though, and looks like it would be good for a pickup truck bed, with the included lock, earning it 2 stars back."
2,I wasn't into it,"I thought this was going to be about the shadow government with an emphasis on the old line new england ivy league blue blood families, Vanderbilts, Astors, Rockefellers, etc. Its about them but its more like if Robin Leach wrote a history book about these families. Social climbing, who had an affair with who, lavish lifestyles, etc. I wasn't into it."
1,Tyler Perry's Madea's Class Reunion,I want a refund on this dvd. I sent it back once because I recieved the play instead of the movie.
5,Extremely Pleased,"Shipment on this product was faster than expected. The DVD has no scratches, DVD case in mint condition, product is as good as new. I couldn't tell the difference between this DVD and others I purchased new from retail stores. The play is awesome. I watched it numerous of times. Overall, I'm extremely pleased."
5,Movie Rating,"This is by far my favorite Tyler Perry Play!!!!! Believe me, if you are a Madea fan, you will love this DVD!!!!!"
4,A good example of Dick's early fiction,"I enjoyed _Time Out of Joint_. It is much simpler in structure andconcept than many of his later books, but you can see some of thethemes that came to dominate his later works here, too. The imageof a hot-dog stand dissolving into a slip of paper that says ""hotdog stand"" has stuck in my mind over the years."
4,Nice little film,"Besides the pornographic title, this movie is a nice, quaint movie. It's especially fun if you're above 40 years old. The only bad part is Rush's American accent. It's horrendous."
3,a little slow,"The first hour of this movie was really slow and did not really keep my interest. Then once Goldie Hawn hooked up with Susan Saradon it got a little better, but Goldie Hawn plays this whorish character, which is a little disturbing. And the movie just was not all that great. I don't even think it is worth watching again to make sure."
3,Great Light Movie With A Lot Of Laughs!,"I really enjoyed this movie! It was very funny! Goldie Hawn and Susan Sarandon made a great pair in this movie! It's about two women who were friends in the 60's, and Suzette goes to Phoenix to see her friend, Lavina and changes her world around. It's a movie about life not too be too uptight and to have some fun every once in a while. This movie was great. I would recommend it for all ages! The R rating is for a few cuss words. Go and laugh away!"
5,A must see comedy!,This movie has become an absolute faveorite of mine! And all of the people that gave it negetive reviews just didnt enjoy the simple comedy of it. Goldie and Susan have great chemestry through the entire movie. The script couldnt be any more funny. I went and bought the movie as soon as I saw it. I still like to watch it and I don't think I will ever get tired of it. This movie is a must see for everyone.
4,Another enthralling epic from the unabashedly real Chute,"Chute's cyclonic novel absolutely captivated me and revealed a world within the state in which I live, but one that will always exist outside of mine as an ""outer-stater"". The characters, their struggles and disappointments were utterly realized. However, I have a problem with Lloyd's final ""Robin Hood"" act. For nearly 700 pages, Chute gave us an utterly endearing and sensitive character in Lloyd Barrington, one who NEVER hurt anyone and only acted against faceless corporations. For him to act so contrary to that nature was unfounded, no matter the economic status of an individual. Any feedback?"
3,Lukewarm fiction,"This book is barely based in fact, and the author notes this at the end. I didn't find the story particularly satisfying -- as fan of Houdini OR as an avid reader of children's literature -- but the artwork is wonderful, particularly the renderings of Houdini himself. I will treasure my copy of the book for the artwork alone."
4,Different,"I don't usually read 'romance novels,' but this is better than most. And the style of writing makes it all the more interesting. The setting is in medieval England and the author uses words and language pertinent to the era. While largely a love story, there is enough other plot to entice the reader tokeep going."
