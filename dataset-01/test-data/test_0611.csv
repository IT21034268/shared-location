2,Foot wakers,"These were much harder than i thought, and smaller in diameter, so i returned them. I got them on a recommendation from my physician, he uses them, but ultimately they weren't What i really wanted."
5,Fast and Extreme..not for country music fans!,"I have all the Napalm Death albums. This is a best of compilation holding a good selection from the Earache label era. Even if you have all their albums you might find that this one is still worth getting as most of the 2nd disc comprises of rarities, unreleased versions and ep songs. They are basically a death metal band with grindcore origins. These guys belt along at a million miles an hour. If you enjoy extreme metal then these guys are for you. If you like country music (augh!)...then your ears are going to end up bleeding listening to this fantastic stuff."
3,The Non-academician review,"The contents seem factual and would serve as a reference book. However, the style is dry and not at all interesting to read. In short, there is no life in the subject, and the author is boring. Not a good read, but one you can easily put down and not be in a hurry to pickup."
3,Brahms: Complete Symphonies,"I was disappointed by the quality of the recording. Many sections of the orchestra sounded muddy and indistinct, particularly the strings; while the brass sounded harsh."
1,Not worth the money,The scale worked properly only for about 6 months then the buttons started to stick and that rendered the memory & fat percentage reader useless. Also like others noted when you move it to different areas it will give you different weight readings. It was a huge disappointment and I would NOT buy this product again.
2,bad product,"First I recived this product broken.Amazon changed it without problem,But the new one have a low precision.I think is a Bad product from HoMedics."
1,Hate the side bar,"I knew when I looked at it in the store that it was a good idea that wasn't going to work, but there wasn't another option, so I bought it and took it home. Of course it wouldn't remotely fit over the side of our bathtub. Just a regular cast iron tub. So annoying. Wish I could buy it without the arm attachment."
1,I had higer hopes,"I had higer hopes for this. My son likes to sit in it, but it's near impossible to wash him all over in it. Also, I took him out of it the first night and the rough plastic on the bottom of the seat scratched his little toe so badly it bled. Needless to say we don't use it anymore and it just takes up space in our bathroom."
1,Overpriced seller alert!,WOW! I'm currently shopping around and have seen this bath seat for $29.99. Please research before you buy this for over twice what other shops' price!
1,bad design,"I have not even used this item. I bought it b/c we bathe our 5 month old with our two year old, and he is able to now sit up with help. I haven't used it b/c i went to put it in the tub and it doesn't fit right because all 3 tubs in our house have slanted sides and the tubside connector on the seat goes straight up and down, so the seat leans to the side. I don't think the tubs in our house are unique, I think they are just like everyone elses bathtubs, so i don't know how others are using it, and loving it. Maybe they don't mind their babies being tipped while in the tub. I am looking for one of the older styles that just sit in the tub."
4,A Real Help at Bathtime,"We originally bought a First Years tub that was supposed to turn into a bath seat. It was great, but the suction cups didn't hold to the textured bottom of our tub, so we bought this bathseat. This has been great! The arm rest sure has saved some wear and tear on our elbows. The seat kept us from having to worry about holding our son while we were also trying to wash him. The seat doesn't slide around in the tub, and it's great that we can rotate him in the seat to wash different parts of his body. We haven't had any trouble reaching any body parts, nor have we had problems with scraping his legs when removing him from the seat. The part that goes over the tubside adjusts, so it fit our tub, but just barely. Our only complaint is that we can't find a place to put it when someone wants to take a shower! It's pretty bulky. But we feel it's worth the hassle for a couple of months to keep him safe."
1,What a let down,"I was so excited to see this new seat with the arm rest and swivel seat. I bought it for my 5 1/2 month old son who can sit up. However, when I take him out of the seat he gets huge red marks on his thighs because the leg openings aren't big enough. It is also impossible to clean his bottom because he is sitting. He can't play with his toys because he has to lean all the way over the seat and he can't reach anything. Plus in order to reach him I have to lean over the arm rest so I don't even use it. I thought I found the perfect solution, but it is going back!"
3,Doesn't Fit!,"I think the older version (the blue one) is much better. This one is very bulky and doesn't fit my tub. I have a normal sized tub, only a little deeper than most, so the arm rest doesn't come up far enough. I thought I could use it without the armrest, but there are no suction cups on the bottom. This tub seat should be made to accommidate all tubs, or have a detachable armrest. I wish I could find the old one somewhere. My 8 month old is too big for the infant tub, but too active for the regular tub."
3,much better than the bath seat,much better han the bath seat cause this one doesnt have suction it has something that hookes on the side but its still hard to clean baby
1,Consumer Reports says this product is dangerous!,"I just read about this product on www.consumerreports.org and they say this product does not meet the safety standards it claims to.Here's a clip from the article: The new Safety 1st Tubside Bath Seat, which doesn't rely on suction cups, claims to conform with the new standard. It relies on a spring clamp that fits over the edge of the tub. However, our tests show that it's a problematic design. We found that when the tub wall is wet, the seat tipped forward or backward and dislodged with less force than the revised safety standard specifies for suction-cup seats."
2,hurt my son,"My son absolutely hated this, he cried every time I put him in there since it hurt him. There is nothing to stop them for sliding forward when he plays in the water, so he slides right into the middle bar and hurts himself. I'm trying to give it away now."
1,A bad idea for your little ones....,"When I first bought this seat I thought it was great. My 6mth old could take a bath with his 3yr old sibling and made things much easier for me, however I have changed my view. After having the seat only for about 6 weeks I started noticing mold/mildew in the tub and soon realized it was coming from the seat. Due to this seat's design you can't leave in in your tub or it doesn't drain properly, though I'm not sure that it would anyway and you can't take it apart to clean it.It's not worth the risk for your little ones.KR mom of 2 in Oklahoma"
1,This tub is TERRIBLE if you don't have a traditional sized tub!,"All five of our bathrooms have big, garden jacuzzi tubs. We don't have any standard size tubs. This company failed to take this into consideration when they made this!I can't find any of the regular old tub seats for babies like they had when I had my first son, six years ago.I definitely do not recommend this tub if you have anything except a standard size tub.Maybe I'm not in the majority here, but this company really ought to take this into consideration, and maybe next time they will make a removable side."
5,a rare positive 'Nam related experience,"""Tour of Duty"" was a tremendous television show. It's a shame that it only lasted three seasons. It is one of my all time favorite television shows. Along with ""Magnum:P.I."" it stands as a shining example of showing Vietnam veterans in a positive light instead of the stereotypical brooding, psyhologically damaged loner that has become so prevalent in film since the end of the conflict in 1975. As a Nam Vet I greatly appreciate that positive message and the television show is superbly produced and highly entertaining as well as historically enlightening. All in all a great show and a great value."
4,The writer of hits,"J. J. Cale / The Definitive Collection: J. J. is the writer of many hits for other people. This CD has his own versions of those hits plus several other excellent songs. This album is very enjoyable and is a fine collection of his songs, but the best versions are still the ones that Other people has done. J. J.'s writing is fantastic. His singing is fair. This CD is a solid Four Star release."
5,Excellent Product from Sony,"Excellent product from Sony. Once I received shipment I installed the radio and within 15 minutes I was listening to my favorite tunes. The reception was above average and I didn't have to extend the cord for better reception, Guess I was lucky. By far one of the better Kitchen radios, easy installation, easy to operate and the sound is excellent. Looked at the GE, because that was all that was available in my area and was not pleased with the cheap look or the hollow tin can sound."
3,Superficial upgrades make MB 11 less useful than it should b,"At 42 it seemed time to finally sit down and learn how to type properly. I've been seeing Mavis Beacon recommended for years (I first started using a PC in 82) so it was the natural place to start. I'm only part of the way through, but so far I'm dissappointed. The basic engine looks like it hasn't been updated in a decade, and the resolution of the letters is so poor that i,l and 1 are almost indistinguishable. There are a number of later add-ons, like games, but they come with no instructions or explanation. The encouraging messages are inconsistent (simultaneously telling me I'm doing great and that I need to start the lesson again). The program has also twice thrown me right back to the beginning of the first lesson (asdf...) without any way to override. Having said that, the basic program does its job, but I bet you can get an earlier version for a lot less money and not miss anything important"
1,horrible piece of junk,"I bought this a couple of years ago, and started off with no problem other than that the screen auto dimmer thing wasn't very effective. Then more recently, a problem came up. I tried to take out a CD that I had put in, and the CD player mechanism had broken. I literally had to pry the thing open to get a CD out, then, of course, it was broken. Thankfully the speakers were good, so I now have them on a new stereo accompanying other ones... don't waste your money"
3,Needs information about bathrooms!,"For a book geared for children, it seems very odd that campground amenities are not detailed. When traveling with young children, flush toilets and showers are very important!"
1,It's a TOY. Good if you want to steam clean your mirrors,Useless piece of equipment. Waste of time and effort. At least for me. May is good for you. I BET you 1000$ that in very short time will end up in your closet or garage unused.
4,works good,works pretty good I like the idea of the thing. Haven't figured out the way to steam the bottom of the clothes easily.
4,Works fine,"This steamer works fine so far. I don't use it for everday ironing, but it's great for steaming the wrinkles out of jackets, drapes and other items that don't lend themselves to pressing on the ironing board."
1,you get what you pay for,I was never so disappointed in anything I've purchased. This steamer didn't even work 15 minutes until it automatically shut itself off and never gave out enough steam to make any difference. I am sending it back.
1,I thought that with proper care this will last a few years,"WTF. It just died on me today. I got this after Christmas. I have always been lucky with cheap products, because I take extremely good care of my stuff. So I thought this one will last me a few years, at the very least. 6-7 months of use and now this is freaking dead! Don't waste your money."
2,"Ok when it works, but it doesn't work much","The cons outweigh the pros: there is no way to lock the wheels--this thing is constantly trying to get away from you while you are using it or are trying to turn it on or off or hitting the reset button in frustration; the pole and head are flimsy and seem to be designed to drop whatever you hang on them on to the floor while you are trying to steam; and finally, the 40 minute water tank makes promises the steamer simply can't keep. You'll be lucky to get 3-5 minutes of steam before the unit trips its circuit breaker and you have to turn it off and wait half an hour for it to cool down so you can turn it back on again.If you only need a few minutes of steam and are willing to put up with the steamer trying to get away from you and or drop your clothes on the floor, this is definitely the steamer for you."
2,Won't get another one,"Received this as a gift in 2005 but recently (2008)threw it in the garbage after the tank started leaking. Initially, it worked fine. However there were several things that bothered me about this product:1. Height: too short---made it difficult to clean long garments.2. Hose: Over time, kinks developed, preventing steam from getting to the head.3. Water tank: Residual water in device turned orange (this happened in the beginning). I used distilled water and regularly dumped out the water after each use so I'm not sure why this occurred.I'm now in the market to buy a new steamer. I think I'll get a quality steamer like the Jiffy J-2000."
2,good then not-so-much,"I loved this little steamer at first, but then the reset button would turn on in the middle of steaming one item. I cleaned the steamer out diligently. After all the time spent cleaning and checking the steamer, I could have ironed a rack full. I am going to order a ""Made in the USA"" Jiffy steamer tonight. If your time is valuable, pass this up and get a steamer that works consistently and efficiently."
1,Died on first use,"This steamer worked just long enough to steam one t-shirt, then it stopped making steam. Tried letting it sit awhile, turning it on and off etc etc but it was done - no more steam. Returned it the day after I got it. This isn't my first bad experience with Homedics products so I should have known better. I loved my last steamer(Shark brand - lasted several years)but it seems to have been discontinued."
2,Doesn't do much,"i guess I was hoping to be able to replace my iron, but that isn't the case. It didn't really get many wrinkles out - maybe of a very certain type of fabric it would work, but it wasn't good enough for my general needs. The steam kind of spurted and made water spots on the fabrics. A disappointment, I don't reccomend it."
3,Not a profesional steamer,"I like it. It is simple to use but:1. For some reason it will reset itself several times2. it is not very stable when hangin clothes on its own pole3. The steam is not very strong, so it takes a while to work on a shirt"
2,Amazing release!,wow when I first heard this album I was hooked on it so much I decided to sell my carcass and sarcafago albums (those bands sucked anyways playing too much ballad-like songs with absolutely no radio or trl airplay) but anyways this band is truly the best thing since slipknot and spineshank they're material is very original and they're lyrical theme is just breath-taking if I could give it more than 2 stars I wouldand if you're a big fan of nu-metal I suggest you get this forget buying slipknot they ripped these guys off!
3,just my two sense,yeah btw those songs that you mentioned arent new.. they're from the first 3 cd's they put out... The new cd actually has NEW stuff on it..
3,"Not bad, just not enough!","Holmberg's designs are fascinating. However, it would have been nice to have instruction for more of the items shown - for example, there is a photo of a really cute ""Toddler's Hooded Jacket"" but no instructions for it!A really good idea sourcebook, certainly, although I cannot understand her fascination with watermelons.Instructions are given for only two wearable items - this was somewhat disappointing (Her first book contains more).There are some interesting techniques, but I definitely preferred her first book."
3,some nice ideas,There are some nice ideas in this book but it isn't what I expected. I found the instructions to be a little bit long winded. It's a nice book to browse through however and doesn't give the reader an understanding on how to make chennille. I would still want to have this book in my library though I don't think I'd have to refer to it too often.
4,a classic blues collection!,This is Dave Mcleans second CD and better than the first. The songs are unique with very simple accompanyment. It almost seems as if he sat down with the musicians for a jam session and they printed the results. His voice is raw and the lyrics are sheer poetry. I especially liked Dust my broom and Rollina and Tumblin. He has a very Chicage sound! As a Canadian I consider him a national treasure!
1,"Hardly a ""Best of"" Collection","Unless you are amused by EVERYTHING SNL produced with Will Farrell, prepare to be disappointed by this DVD. There are so many bland skits in this collection (the post 12:30 AM garbage) that you wonder who complied this thing. The distributors must be considering parcelling out the best skits among several disks (perhaps including those under the names of other SNL best-of titles). This collection had a few highlights, but was mostly composed of mediocre crapola... don't bother with it."
3,Could there be another DVD for will?,"I just got this DVD and I have to say it's missing allot of what made Will so good to watch.Some classic skits are here and worth buying,just beware it's short."
5,Will Ferrell,Definatley THE BEST parts of Saturday night live! I can see where the idea of the 'Anchor Man' movie came from! Loving it!
5,Soo Effing Funny!!!,"I absolutely love the best of Will Ferrell. The man is an absolute god. His audition is soo great... he came up with the Harry Carey sketch. GET OFF THE GODDAMN SHED!!!! I can never stop laughing when I watch that. YOU CANNOT TALK TO ME LIKE THAT, I AM A DIVISION MANAGER... I DRIVE A DODGE STRATUS!!! Pretty much, it just doesnt get much better than the best of Will Ferrell... cept maybe the best of Chris Farley, but that is a whole different story."
1,What a joke...,"This may be the worst collection of Farrell clips they could've put together. I loved The best of Chris Farley, but this was a mess. The skits we're weak and nothing we haven't seen before in their many compilation shows.. How many times has he played Trebek? Do we really need to see the same one with Sean Connery, Burt Reynolds, and French Stewart again? And not even the whole skit on top of it all.. What a waste of money this was! What a shame......"
5,not a first contact novel,"This is not a first contact novel. Rather, this novel has a lot more in common with a standard mystery/suspense story of the ""corporate intrigue"" subcategory, albeit in an advanced technological civilization. The main character, Gwynne Heikki runs a salvage company and while working on a contract recovering a crashed space ship, accidentally discovers a secret that the corporation that owns that craft wishes to keep silent by any means. There's plenty of action with a good dose of finely tuned cultural observations. I found it extremely enjoyable, especially because of the strong women lead characters. Melissa Scott has been one of my favorite authors for many years. Wish she'd come out with a new book sometime soon."
4,Computerized Management of Multiple Small Projects (Cost Engineering),Recommended reading for course I took. Somewhat dated but still had some good info.
1,Copyrighted 1992,I mistakenly purchased this book for a class in Fall 2009.This book's copyright is 1992. That would have been Microsoft Windows 3.1You make your own judgement on this.
5,best bundle,"this is the best bundle ever! I love the stand, it is easy to store and sharp for display!"
5,This is the best,"I htink that this game package should be a 5 star rating because it includes the best games that a kid could want i love football, snowbording, and basketball so i love this game package.. honesly i think that this should be under a high demand all because of the games that come with the package....."
2,Poor Workmanship Hard to Explain,I was disappointed with the workmanship and quality of the laser square I received. The square itself (metal base) is cheap and looks like something Wally World would be ashamed to sell for $2.95. The laser seems to work fine and is adjustable so no problem there. On mine the bulky and childish looking laser assembly and shield protrudes enough that the outside of the square will not sit flush or square with a flat surface. Overall a good idea but poor execution.
2,Sent it back,"We do a lot of remodeling. We felt that the laser capability was not a sufficient enough reason to buy this square since it only gave a ""dot"" instead of a line. We've gone back to our old square and laser."
2,Not very durable,"I bought this square and only got to use it a couple of times before the lasers started acting up and not working. When they did work they were so dim that I could not see them with my hand right in front of them. But, when it did work it worked very well."
3,Chewing gum,"this is a good product for people who like gum but have dental work to which most gum sticks.I've ordered from Amazon because they have the best price for bulk purchases; I save almost 40% off per-pack retail prices.There is potential for a problem; Wrigley dates each of its bulk packages with a best by date. Generally, Wrigley gum is 'fresh' if the best by date is 6 months or more in the future. Current shipments from Amazon are dated 5/9/09; this is only 2 months away. There is potential to receive stale product; Amazon would most likely accept a return but we don't buy things with the expectation we will return them."
3,Tasteless!,This would be great for someone who just wants to freshen their mouth for a few minutes. Would not recommend for those looking for long-lasting taste.
2,ho-hum,"I have to go ahead and agree with Justin...Seasons Change is the only awesome song on here. In fact, its my 3rd favorite song of all time. I never even knew it was in this disgrace of a movie. I mean, the only you other ppl think the other songs are good is cause they talk about tokin up and crap like that. Screw rap and that other BS, get some DOTN and get to jammin."
2,Only 4 good songs on this CD,"I bought this CD for the song by Cibo Matto ""Who's got the light?"" which is an awesome song. The only other songs i like are ""Along comes Mary"", ""I get Lifted"", and ""Season's Change"". The rest of the songs are pretty dry and i can't stand to listen to the whole CD. That song ""We are Dumb"" is very annoying, like most of the other songs. If you're a Cibo Matto fan like me, then that should be you're only reason to buy it."
5,What Sci Fi was designed to do...,"On the surface, The Octagonal Raven is a compelling, intelligent thriller. It can be read as such. However, this story is far more than that. Modesitt satirically blows up the flaws in our society and uses them for a greater purpose. He picks on the alarming bias of 24/7 news channels, strikes at the elitist medical system in our world, and allows the reader to consider many other social issues. The Octagonal Raven is an exciting and suspenseful science fiction novel. Modesitt has truly evolved into a pivotal and important writer of the new millenium."
1,Poor value,"Within two months the light ballast broke, which cost $25.00 to replace, than the filter pump broke. That was it - this tank is going into the trash!"
2,Pretty is as pretty does,"Like other people who have reviewed this item, I liked the way the tank looked and the price seemed reasonable. However, the first time I cleaned the tank I started having problems with the pump not working properly. I've been struggling to keep this pump running for the short 8 months I've owned the tank and I'm fed up with the hassle. This tank isn't a good deal, or even reasonably priced, if you have to replace it in less than a year. Pretty is as pretty does and I'm finding this tank less and less attractive. I wish I had read the reviews on this tank before I purchased it from a local retailer."
5,Great Customer Support,This is my second Eclipse 3 system. I had the other one 8 years. I got the new one installed and after a month I had trouble with the lights. They wouldn't light up. Not sure what caused the problem but I contacted Marineland and they had me FAX a receipt of purchase. They sent me a new light system. No hassle.
1,Arrived broken,"I am only giving this item a bad review because it arrived broken. I don't think the product is bad, but I do take issue with the vendor/shipper for not properly packaging the merchandise."
3,A little disappointed,"So far the tank is beautiful all set up and we have not had any problems but it did not arrive in great condition.The plastic lid was cracked and instead of messing with the huge hassle of returning/exchanging the very large item, my handy hubby was able to glue the shard back on that had snapped off in transit. Now the lid itself seems to be warped and does not sit flush on the tank. If we were ever to have any very sneaky, jumpy fish, they might be able to escape as there is a gap in the back corner of the tank.Other than that, it is beautiful and we like the seemlessness of the acrylic over the glass tank. Can get other complete tank sets for A LOT less but we like the look of this one and all the filters etc being in the lid and not taking up space in the back of the tank. Wish it came with a heater and thermometer and net for the price you pay..."
3,Staying Afloat,I just started on my second filter after the first malfunctioned. Discussion with a pet store employee revealed that the water level in the aquarium must be above the impeller inside the filter and thus close to or touching the part of the filter that sits above the aquarium. So you should definitely unplug the filter when changing water and make sure you refill it close to the top. If the filter is allowed to run when the water level is low the motor will burn out. Also Marineland sent the replacement filter to me for free two days after I called them. Their number is on the instruction sheet that comes with the aquarium.
2,Filter Stopped Working After Only A Few Months,"I bought the Marineland Eclipse 12 aquarium unit a few months ago. I've kept fish for over 30 years, but thought it would be easier to set up a new tank with the hood and filter attached. Unfortunately, I've not been pleased with this tank. I will say that when I check my ammonia levels that they are generally good and so the biowheel and filter must be doing their job. However, working in the tank itself is VERY difficult because the filter apparatus is in the way. Also, my filter suddenly stopped working and so I guess the biowheel won't be doing its job now will it? I've only had this tank for a few months and the filter must not be very good if is stops working. I take good care of my tanks and so there was no reason for it to stop working unless the filter is of poor quality."
4,Should have gotten the bigger one,"No matter what else can be said, bigger might be better. This is a small tank. If you're looking at this, consider the bigger one. And the fish are always caught in the swirl of water going around. If I had to do it over, I'd have gotten a bigger tank that's retangular. Regular tanks are still cool."
4,Good tank,"Nice size, everything worked out of the box. Only two issues:1. Water flows over 30% of the filter based on the setup. Can't maneuver the filter any differently, the water just flows around it.2. There is one way to open the top of the tank to feed teed the fish. You stick a fingernail into a crack and pry up a cover that has to be held in place while open or it will fall down the back side of the tank. A hinged opening near the front of the cover would make this tank allot easier to use on a daily basis.Next time I am going with glass, afraid to scrub algae off the plastic sides."
5,very nice tank,"This is a great tank for my betta. Just make sure you fill it all the way up, almost to the light. Then the filter doesn't make any noise, just a little fountain sound. Someone told me that bettas, being sort of stagnant water fish don't do well with filters. My betta is doing fine, so either it is not a strong enough filter to damage him, or that person's filter was too vigorous."
2,Motor burns out/Parts difficult to find.,"Purchased the system 6 and hex 5 for the grandchildren about 2 years ago,Both units are good for a few small fish and the bio system does a good job. The pump motor is starting to actup. Needs a replacement.(hex 5)Can't complain at least it ran 2 years. The system 6 I have replaced the pump unit twice in two years. Both time it just stopped and refused to work.(kept the water at the right level). They are a sealed unit so repairs are out. Marineland is of no help. Imported from China? The filters are just as hard to locate.If not for the internet and help from online suppliers You would end up tossing them out.As one other reviewer stated for the price, you would be better off with a 10-15 gallon conventional setup. Make sure you purchase products that have a good customer service and parts available. I don't recommend marineland."
5,Great beginner setup,"This is a perfect package for the person who has no fish related products.This package come with almost every thing that you need, just add a couple fish, rocks and a plant or two.Comes in a few pieces but, following the simple ""picture"" directions make it pretty easy to put the filter together and all the pieces that make up the top of the tank.Replacement filters are only a couple dollars and even come in multipacks for a bigger discount.Pros:Comes with most every thing you need to start an aquarium.Comes with florescent lightIts not glass and has no seams that could leak.Cons:Doesn't come with and rocks or plantsOverall this is a great starter tank for someone who only wants a couple fish or only has a small space for a fish tank."
2,NOT FOR SALTWATER!!! At least I learned a valuable lesson...,"When I purchased this, I was new in the world of marine aquaria. If there is one good thing I can say about it, that would be that it taught me exactly what a mini reef tank should not be!!! The lights are ridiculously poor. The bulky lid with attached light is innefficient, as is the filtration. The filtration makes absolutley no sense as the water goes over, not through the filter. This is not a tank that I would recommend. I would skip this entirely and go with a glass aquarium and put my own equipment into it. Read as much as possble. This is not a tnk for anenomes or corals, and seeing as I was hoping to start with this back then, I was extremely disappointed."
3,eclipse system 3,3 stars cause I got it cheaper. Got it for 12 dollars so this is probably not the greatest deal.
1,What size is this tank?,"OK, the rating is based on the description, not on the product - but how should I know if this is the right product if I can't tell what size it is?"
4,A Great Introductory Book on the Geology of Grand Canyon,"Written in easy to understand language, this book is both interesting and informative. It provides generalized maps of geologic highlights along the trail, black & white pictures, and drawings which all tie into the informative text sections. Spiral bound with vinyl cover for rough handling during the hike. Highly recommended!"
3,Middle of the pack,"Pros:- The writer has a laid back style that is easy to read and understand.- The book covers most of the topics you'll need to know about when buying or selling a house.- Some good examples are provided for problem scenarious and""what if"" situtations.Cons:- It doesn't appear as though a proper editing has been done. Some of the web sites listed are still in pure HTML code rather than in edited text. Furthermore, some of the software mentioned cannot be found on the included CDROM.- The material is lacking in nitty gritty details.For the price it's not too bad, but I should have spent my money on a book about buying instead of buying & selling."
5,"Import friendly, even though it's in Japanese","A fantastic album by two of the most talented musicians in the world. As other reviewers have mentioned, Chage and Aska have an uncanny talent for writing and performing songs that move them in new directions, yet retaining the essence of their music. The themes and sounds of this album seem to me much darker than earlier albums (""Mure,"" ""Nettaigyo,"" ""Higher Ground"" in particular) but with occasional moments of hope and love (""Kono Ai no Tame ni""). Even for those who cannot understand Japanese, it's easy to appreciate the vocals and composition, so this CD is recommended for all."
1,Hard to Use,"There are no instructions with this software, you have no idea where to start, or how to access image files and get them where you want them. If I want to use this software I have to pay another $20 for the how to book."
2,"Fascinating, but troublesome","Davis Klinghoffer's book, written from the viewpoint of a religous, and political conservative, has its fascinating moments. Moments such as a do-it-yourself bris, or finally meeting his birth-mother and the subsequent trip to her homeland of Sweden. Troublesome in that Klinghoffer seems to delight in putting down those who don't believe as he does now. I would have much preferred to read about how he believes his belief system is the best, rather than the potshots at those who don't live up to his idea of what a Jew is. I can only attribute this as an offshoot of his political conservatism in which the equation liberal=bad is the operative idea. However, if one can get past the denigration, and read it as an very personal journey, it should be worth picking up"
2,better than the TV movie from 1996,that doesn't mean much. The Dalek episode was by far the best. Why can't they travel to other planets? Earth is boring. The WWII episode was not in character with any Dr Who book/episode.This wasn't worth waiting for.
5,Good Series,"Got this for my fiance and I to watch, is a very good up take of the 70's show of the same name the ""new"" Doctor's are great and Hilarious... I think it is a must own for a sci-fi fan."
5,The reboot of the series...,"This is a fine boxed set for lovers of Doctor Who! It seems amazing that we're already three Doctors into the series reboot, but this takes us back to the beginning. Seeing Christopher Eccleston and Billie Piper finding their chemistry just as the Doctor and Rose do is great fun."
3,Doctor Who: The Complete First Series,"Don't let this fool you. This item is the new 'cheap/basic' packaging. I was expecting the actual container to be of the Tardis and fold out to show the interior of the Tardis. (Like what you find on the other Amazon listing for the same product.) I was also expecting a paper episode guide that this did not have. I blame myself for not researching more, but I'm still disappointed. It's simple like any other DVD case you would get with a regular movie, except the inside has slots for five discs. Needless to say I'm bummed out. But I guess that's what I get for buying it for only $23.00."
4,Go Rose!,"Rose was a fantastic companion to the doctor, by far my favorite. You must see series from this point on."
2,Love Dr.Who--but no english subtitles?!,"I LOVE Doctor Who! I was in the mood to watch it so I decided to use up my instant video credit on an episode--hoping that they would have english subtitles since it's available on DVD. Unfortunately it does not. Amazon, that needs to be changed. If the movies on DVD has subtitles, then your instant videos should too! -Dissatisfied (deaf) customer"
2,Again too many worthless extras,"This rating is not for the show, which gets 5-stars. The show is great, but I have a problem with all the crappy extras used as an excuse to charge a ridiculous price. Having seen this series even before the Sci-Fi Channel aired it, I can attest to the quality of the stories. Christopher Eccleston fantastically portrays our favorite timelord. In fact I wish he would have chosen to stay on for another year or two. Two problems with the series itself: 1) most of the aliens on Platform One look like something you'd find in Star Wars, not a good thing; 2) although I like Captain Jack as a character, they could have done without the ""yag"" angle (figure it out, as I couldn't get it on here if I had spelled it properly). I felt like I was watching Will and Grace at times. As for my main flaw with the DVDs themselves, if you look around, you can fortunately find bootleg copies of the stories on DVD-R for a much cheaper price, if you just need the episodes and nothing else."
1,Doctor Who The Complete First Series,Purchased the Series as a Christmas Gift and now I will only get partial credit for Disc 4 Skipping. I Find that unexceptable for someone who tries to get Christmas shopping done early.
3,It's probabl over rated,It's mostly predictable but it's entertaining to watch. On season 3 but still not grabbing me. (i hate this review processing requiring ppl to write more words or it won't let you submit.) Purely waste of my time and taught me a lesson not to write reviews
5,Well worth the Money,"Mr. Miller's provides a refreshlying honest analysis of the problems within the Democratic party.This book is very much worth reading, especially for the upcomming 2004 political season."
5,Thank you Zell,"For all of you who think Zell isn't a democrat......he is! For all of you who doesn't know the state he was a Governor, tells me you didn't read the book! It also tells me the criticism is from left wing radical liberals. Go read Michael Moore propoganda! Leave Zell Miller alone.Great Book! A must read for all"
2,"Good ideas, put-you-to-sleep style","I am a recovering democrat and I would say Zell Miller and I agree on most things. However I have to be honest, I couldn't finish the book. It was boring, and if Zell really wrote this himself, then he needs to get a better editor. He rambles way off topic. And he seems to be stuck a bit in the 1970's. I think he doesn't really understand where either party is today. So while I say ""right on Zell"" I really can't recommend this book to anyone."
1,Grumpy Old Man,"Mr. Miller spends a long time spewing out the same old ignorant, hateful, and fear injecting stuff that so many others have been regurgitating for a long time. He uses few facts to back up his points and just seems to be a confused & grumpy old man."
1,Opportunism at its best....Badly written as well.,Whoever ghosted this book definately was a rookie. The style and diction thats used would make a dyslexic fell like einstein.Zell miller is a lame duck senator about to leave office and needs a cushy retirement gig. Right now supporting bush politically and financially is good payoff for a good retirement.Expect to see Zell head up lucrative GOP tied hedge fund or 'advisory' panel next year.
1,Are all Republican utter idiots?,"Ronald Reagan was a Democrat when JKF was president? No he wasnt you moron, Reagan even wrote a letter to Nixon in 1960 calling JFK ""a closet Marxist with a tousled haircut"". Jeez, no wonder Republicans never went to college, they'd definetely flunk history. *shaking my head in disbelief at Repub ignorance*"
1,The conscience of a Democratic traitor,"As a Former Marine myself, and a proud Democrat, I must confess to a true dislike of Zell Miller. To us soldiers and us Irish, there is nothing worse then a traitor. Zell Miller fits that label to a tee. This book is the latest in a long line of Republican dribble, (along with similar trash from cowardly conservatives like Ann Coulter and Tucker Carlson)The difference is that this man CLAIMS to be a Democrat!He most certainly is not. In this book Miller spews the same GOP garbage as his Republican friends, this guy is so out of step with America and his own party, it is a disgrace that he calls himself a Democrat. By doing so and by writing this book, he proves himself to be a traitor to his own party. If he admitted to being a Republican, he would at least not be a traitor, but he would still be inferior."
1,An embarrassment not just for the Democrats...,"nor even just for Zell Miller himself. This book is a humiliation for anyone who had hopes that the South had really moved on from Jim Crow and the delusions of aristocracy that the political elite like Zell Miller maintain. It is a throwback to plantation days. Zell Miller demonstrates in his characteristically rabid, if not eloquent, prose that not all white trash live in trailer parks...some trash, like Miller, have apparently gotten quite well to do on the backs of the people, living high and mighty off of tax dollars, and all the while, step and fetchin' for his corporate masters.This book, much like any mention of ol' Zell, makes me want to vomit. Don't waste even a nickel on this trash. Zell is wealthy enough."
4,Passionate writing from a sincere pen,"Zell Miller has eloquently combined autobiographical aspects, covering his childhood and rise to political leadership, as well as ideological notes and commentary. Senator Miller has the cajones to attack liberal democrats when he feels his ""old South"" sense of values is in disagreement with them. Throughout the book, the 44-year officeholder speaks candidly about many issues facing our country now, analyzing them thoroughly and thoughtfully. There are no sacred lambs here, although Miller takes a higher road than other smear merchants have in their books; the Senator remains on a pleasant basis with those he speaks of in the text.On the whole, Miller has worked hard to put together a worthwhile account of his life and the many lessons he has learned in many years, particularly throughout politics, as well as serious confrontation of the woes that face his esteemed nation in 2003."
1,WATCHING MILLER'S PRINCIPLES ERODE,"Zell Miller should reallign himself with a political party with which he agrees. In spite of a long career in Democratic politics, he is voicing such strident complaints about the party, he may as well just come out of the closet as a Republican. While this book is interesting in that it sheds some light on the ugly inner workings of the legislative process, it is most interesting as a study of a man who started a long career with ideals and aspirations for America but nears the end of his career alligned with the party whose policies are dictated by big corporate donors. The book makes it clear that Miller has lost his conscience along the way, the title of the book notwithstanding. Misguided. Untimely. Sad."
3,new superman movie brandon routh was great,"this movie of verison was ok better superman 3 and superman 4 but it match with batman beings or the frist superman movie but it follow the comics about the death superman well not realty superman kill was by doomday in the comics brandon routh was great he was a great for superman kate didn,t play as well kevin space did well the two this movie didn,t the punch as blade that movie was awsome the problem with DC Comics they use super heroes that most people know mavel a better job by use major super heroes ghost rider will better . the thing i like about this is the fact they chossen minor actor for this one instread chossing a big name actor this movie could had been better with batman beings that movie with so much better. it match the batman from 1989 with micheal keaton i gald they gave superman new face the smallville series is better."
3,Great picture with an average plot,"This is an interesting movie with both pros and consThe picture quality is outstanding and provided you have the proper hd 1080 equipment you will really enjoy it.The plot is interesting although it tends to be slow at times. It does reflect the 1970s theme which gives it an interesting twist. Kevin Specey is the villain taken directly out of the comic book but his character is spiced up both by his acting as well as the script. However Lois Lane (Kate Bosworth) is quite flat and, at least in this movie, does not justify Superman's feelings towards her.The directing is decent. Sole exception is that in the airplane flight in the beggining of the film she gets bounded around quite badly (an average person would have being killed) yet she emerges without a scratch or broose and her hair is perfectly combed while the rest of the women in the scene are all messed up.All in all it is not a bad film with an excellent picture quality."
2,Should have left well enough alone,"You have to love classic Superman. We had been building up what an awesome superhero Superman is to our kids, but this was a movie night flop. In their words ""He didn't even fight!"" This movie was a melodramatic disaster and a disgrace to Superman movies."
1,"If this is the best he can do, Superman shouldn't have Returned","Don't waste your time with this movie. If you've seen Superman:The Movie with Christopher Reeve... you've seen this film. No, let me rephrase that... Superman: The Movie had a far better cast & a better director than this boring, rehashed monstrosity. Brandon Routh comes off as a bad Christopher Reeve impersonation, NOT Superman. Kate Bosworth is just scenery as Lois Lane. No personality there. Keven Spacey is wasted by being pigeonholed into a Gene Hackman-styled Luthor. The basic plot of this film is EXACTLY the same as that of Superman: The Movie. Lex Luthor has come up with a crazy real estate scheme, which will involve massive destruction & loss of life, so Superman has to stop him. Many scenes are direct lifts from the Reeve films, albeit with CGI special effects.Don't waste your money on this. In my opinion, it's not even worth renting as a $1.00 rental."
2,I found thie Unbelieveable!!,"I had real trouble with this. We'll start with Brandon whomever. He may look like Christopher Reeve, and he may sound like Christopher Reeve, but there the similarity ends. He came across as dumb as a stump with about as much personality as a tree! And then there was the script. Why did he have to crash land on his mother's farm it he can fly all over the galaxy? Why, if Lois Lane was thrown all over the plane, did she emerge without a scratch on her? I could go on throughout the entire movie like this, but you get the picture. Otherwise it was great with the music and stunts, and all, but a tad bit slow between stunts."
1,Super-retarded,"OMG, where to begin? The movie is slow; the pathetic excuse for a plot doesn't really develop until half way through the movie (and when it does, it's rediculious). The attempt make the characters all tortured and conflicted is just lame. Campy. Predictable. Boring. Cliche. Take your pick.On top of everything else, the Lois Lane character is kind of a b$%ch which makes Superman look like a dufus for fawning over her. Pathetic.The only part of the movie that didn't COMPLETELY suck was Kevin Spacey.This is the worst Superman movie ever and one of the worst movies I've ever seen.So NOT recommended.P.S. I wonder how many people die every day while Superman farts around pretending to be a reporter and stalking Lois Lane..."
2,This Superman is Really Smallville,"I'll try to make this brief. For some reason, I never made it to the movie theater to see SR. Having seen the video, I now know why.Two large problems immediately leap out. First is Kate Bosworth, a terrible choice for Lois Lane. Too bland. Too one-dimensional an actress. It is especially sad, because their ideal actress was right under their noses -- Parker Posey. She would have been the perfect Lois Lane.Second, too much emphasis on Lex Luthor in the beginning. This is a Superman movie that starts with Lex Luthor! They make the same mistake here that they did in those early Batman movies by putting equal emphasis on the Hero and the Villain. We want more Superman!But I will admit that the jet rescue scene is fantastic and almost worth the price of the rental. Almost."
1,Superman Returns,"It didn't work, i coudn't see the movie, i tried for more than an hour without luck, I want a refund of my monet."
3,Could have been better...,"Plainly put...the casting was poor...the plot was very poorly written, and I miss the superman who was all man! Christopher Reeve was tall, sexy, and masculine. This superman could have be a gay male, and have been believable."
3,Is this truly SUPERMAN?,"Terrific attempt at trying to find someone to portray Christopher Reeve as Superman. Botched attempt to bring the legend up to date. Face it. Brandon Routh miscast, thinking that he is an actor.Superman a deadbeat dad? Lois Lane as single mom of an illegitimate child? Living in sin with a man not her husband. Lex Luthor just walking in to the Fortress of Solitude, Unchallenged and without difficulty.Lois forgetting who the father might be? Forgetting that she had sex with Superman? Then remembering that Superman is probably the father of her child. Then not remembering that Superman is Clark Kent.Instead of pretending that Superman III & IV didn't happen, we'd be better off pretending that this one didn't happen. Sorry guys. Back up and try again."
1,"Boring, Ill Casted, Boring, Plagoristic, Boring, Devoid of Common Sense","Shoot Superman with a huge gun then when that doesnt work pull out your hand gun. Yeah right! Doctors try to prick him with needles. Hello! Supermans been around for awhile I think they should know it wouldnt work! Superman lies in a hospital bed and the army, and government isnt there?! No one breaking through the security guards to see Superman! This movie was pretty much a rehash of the original but a horrible one! Lois way too young. Even though Superman looked way too young as well Brandon Routhe(?) did a great job as superman. Plane scene was awesome and the only scene that got me excited during the movie. I could say more but I think its all pretty much been said pro or con."
3,Lacked the magic,"It made an attempt to show continuity to the previous films but the actors came across as much younger and the personality of Lois was boring. The special effects could have been more impressive - it's almost as if the movie was made years ago. In general, the acting was average. It was interesting, but in the end, it lacked the magic..."
2,"Want to watch the ""return to Krypton"" scene? It's NOT here","I must confess: When I saw the movie at the theaters, I hated it. However, after returning home, I suspected that there were a lot of scenes cut from the movie, so I found a site with scans of the movie's ""trading cards"", which contained a lot of material that helped clarify the plot. So... I became interested in finding those missing scenes. The most interesting of all seemed to be the ""Return to Krypton"" scene.So... today I went to the supermarket and found this DVD. I joyfully bought it and played disc 2, expecting to watch ALL the scenes mentioned in the trading cards in their full glory.The ""return to krypton"" sequence was nowhere to be found. I feel that the marketing guys behind this release did it ON PURPOSE, expecting to sell you this same DVD with that scene added a few years from now as a ""platinum edition"" or something like that."
5,SUPERMAN has definitely RETURNED !,"I have to admit that I thought it was just another superman movie, but I was so WRONG !!! I love this movie, it has a variety of entertainment !! The romance just gets to me, there's a chemistry between Superman & Lois Lane. I also enjoyed Lex (Kevin Spacey), he never fails to deliver !!! Adding a son for Superman was a fantastic idea & good twist to the story, it's about time, somebody did this!! I also read that they are doing a sequel sometime late 2007 !! I can't wait to watch the sequel !!"
5,Super time at the movies!,"As an extreme Superman fan, I totally enjoyed this movie. It was more than I ever expected, and the pieces all fell into place. Brandon Routh is wonderful, and is more than able to continue this franchise. Kate Bosworth is terrific as Lois, and I must admit I had misgivings before seeing the movie; but she acquited herself very well. Personally, I can't wait to see the next two films, so here's hoping we don't have to wait another 20 years..................."
2,"Far worse than the other ""Superman""","In a typical fashion today's Hollywood, special effects are used to hide the lack of talents in this aweful movie. Gone are the charms, humor, romance and acting talents of past ""Superman."" All we see are mindless explosions and special effects. What a shame!"
3,"Good Movie, Lacking in Features","I inserted my disc and was like, ""where's the features?"" I didn't know that one had to buy the 2-disc special edition for the features. I was rather disappointed because I wanted to see some sort of tribute to Christopher Reeves or something. DVDs are too pricey to just have the movies on them. Anyway, it's a really good movie. Brandon Routh does a good job of playing Christopher Reeves playing Superman. I wonder if he really studied the Superman movies of the 70s and 80s. He really did the part justice. As for Kate Bosworth as Lois, she did a fair job, but Margot Kidder made a better Lois. Still, it's a really good movie; a fitting sequel to Superman 1 and 2 (let's all forget that 3 and 4 ever happened)."
3,bryan singer sucks,"Bryan singer markets his movies to middle aged housewives. Lex luthors evil plan was the dumbest in the history of evil plans. He was gonna create land. What was gonna stop any country to stop him. Good god Bryan, Superboy! We didn't need to see that. The visuals were stunning but the story stupid. 3 stars for the visual department."
3,Good pass time.,"All in all, a decent film.Good special effects, but not exceptional.Generally good acting.Good story-line.A little slow at times.NOthing super, but moderately satifying."
3,good for old fans of real heavy metal,"this album is good ,but is not their best work,their best work is scarred for life ,this band features mike vecera who later sings with loudness and yngwie malmsteen ,if you like old school heavy metal this is for you!"
4,Heart warming,"A film for the whole family.The main character,Aussie,must face his own dilemma of how to reunite his friend,Ted back with his owner Laney,but when he looses Ted a few times along the way,he must keep trying to locate Ted to bring him back to Laney,after first realizing that taking Ted from LAney was a bad idea.Laney the girl in this story,is given a very special teddybear for Christmas,and when Aussie becomes jealous over feeling like Laney is loving the new found teddybear as a new Christmas gift and ignoring him too much,he hides Ted from Laney in two different places.But when Ted really comes up missing,Aussie makes it his mission to get Ted back for Laney,and runs into a couple of friends,and obstacles,among others,along the way to return Ted to Laney eventually,and finally reunites all in the end at the families new home out in the country at the farm which is given to them as a gift from the fathers,Aunt,played by Beveerly De Angelo.Dean Cain stars in this family movie."
4,"You won't say ""Uh-Oh....","...why did I buy this?"", after you hear it. You'll be SINGING ""Uh-Oh"" at the top of your voice!! And with every listening it gets better. Combining powerful tracks like ""Invincible"", ""Disconnected"" & ""Senseless"" with fun bouncy tracks like ""Bad Girl"" and ""Tell the Girl"", it gives you a glimpse of the range of this band. Give the album a listen, and the next time the Mouth comes to your town, come check 'em out LIVE. I promise you won't be sorry and chances are, you'll leave spreading the word of Cowboy Mouth!!"
2,It's o.k. when it works,"I'm on my third hand-held baby shower. I returned the first two because they quit working after the second or third use. When it does work it is nice because the spray comes out just hard enough to rinse of my baby, but not too hard. The other thing I'm not crazy about is it is very hard to hold on to and push the button, and the button occasionally sticks. If this one breaks, I'm done. I'll use a cup to rinse my baby from now on."
1,Great idea is it worked,This item worked only twice. Prehaps it should be taken off the market until futher notice.
1,Don't expect what is in the pictures,"While the picture looks like stained oak what you get is orange colored ""wood"". Mine was warped and poor fitting in several places, but it just isn't worth the shipping cost and hassle to return it, so it will live some kind of life in the back of a closet, like a stray puppy I just don't have the heart to throw it away. Skip this product and get something worthwhile."
1,Don't Buy This Chest,"I don't know what ""solid hardwood"" means to you, but this isn't it as far as I'm concerned. When it arrived, the hinges had already pulled through the ""wood"". The box even states that it's not solid hardwood. It's a great price and you may get luckier than I didn't, but it was a disappointment overall."
5,Excellent value & good construction.,"I bought this chest for my wife's jewelry. The construction is consistently good and I found no defects wharsoever. I am going to order one for my shop for small tools.I already own a walnut Gerstner chest which is a beauty, but it costs more than 10x the price of the Sisco!The packing was super careful."
3,The price reflects the quality,"For the price the unit is fine. I use it to store my watch collection and some knives too. It came with one of the screws mismatched to attach one of the drawer knobs- so i had fish out my own. But compared to the $200+ other chests I saw- I think its not a bad deal for the money- just dont expect a super high level of fit and finish- if you want a really nice chest- suck it up and spend the money for it, because you wont really find that for $50.00!!"
5,Fits like a glove and looks great,"I really do love the way it makes the revolver look, and it is like it was molded to my hand. I know I will have no problems gripping my weapon even if the grip gets wet, and or (God forbid), bloody. A good investment."
4,For the frugal and crossword obsessed....,"One of my defining personality traits is cheapness. When looking for a crossword book, I wanted the most crosswords for my money, which this definitely is. If you did 3 a day it would still take you most of a year to finish the book. I expect to own the book for 3 or 4 years at the rate I'm going. I would have given it five stars, because of the great array of puzzles included, but it may be too much of a good thing...Maybe I don't really need 1001 crosswords..."
2,Ominbus,The book is a bit too large to comfortably handle as it is a really thick book. I would not recommend.
4,lots of fun,"I love this book of crosswords and always having some to do when I want. The only thing I don't like about this book is how thick it is. It can be a little difficult to fill in some of the puzzles so close to the middle of the book because it doesn't open flat; however, I solve this problem by tearing out the pages. Overall, I love it."
5,I Hope This Series Never Disappears,"This is a wonderful show. PBS in Washington State had doubts about showing the series initially, and I cannot imagine why. Usually, I can figure out mysteries before the end (even many of Christie's) but I've never figured out a Jonathan Creek before the explanation.The only disappointment is that since they are offering a full season, I expected 13 episodes, and they've only included 6. In season 2, they are:Danse MacabreTime Waits for NormanThe Scented RoomThe Problem at Gallows Gate-1The Problem at Gallows Gate-2Mother RedcapApparently, in England, you can get all the episodes on one disc, but the quality isn't as good. The mysteries are ingenious, the characters are enjoyable, and the relationships are fun. This is an excellent series that you won't be disappointed purchasing."
4,the rise and fall of testicles made into art,"This exploration into performance art has two major hurdles. That said, if you can pass the first hurdle, which is your suspension of incredulousness at such an over-the-top interpretation of a basic bio-function, you will find entertainment, high production values, beautiful costuming and thought provoking ""stages"". These stages are Barney's vignettes proscribing the ""mounting"" aspects of the copulative dance leading to the actuation of the cremaster cycle.The second hurdle will be his chosen ending or finale. Though we all know the violence inherent in the sexual act, the final sequence is guaranteed to provoke reactive if not emotional response. Perhaps this was his motivation...to ""pull"" the viewer into the experience. Moreover, a fine piece of stage, choreography, and performance with some obtuse but recognizable allusions to art's ""history""."
2,Matthew Barney.,"I thought of a few things while watching ""The Cremaster"" cycle by super-star artist Matthew Barney. However, through the druggery and slow moving death that was Cremaster, all of those things were forgotten. But, I did learn a very important lesson. The lesson is this:With enough money you can do anything, be it winning the presidency or simpley becoming a famous artist. Either way in the end you're going to turn out horrible."
1,A god-awful piece of tripe,"I didn't really want to give this horrible film one star but, sadly, amazon.com doesn't let us give the really rotten films no stars. I guess they want to make sure that no arrogant directors feel bad if their completely pointless films aren't appreciated. Anyway, I digress, this film makes no sense and I think this piece of tripe should be consigned to the rubbish bin where it belongs. It would be 'cheerio' to Matthew Barney and his pretentious nonsense if I had my way. Oh well, perhaps god will be merciful."
1,ripoff,"i went to New York to see the show at the Guggenheim. i saw all the films & it was great! I was excited learn 3 was on dvd, & i purchased it here. The product details claims that it has a running time of 240 minutes, but this is not true. in reality, i was duped out of $20, for what boils down to a 30 minute trailer. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY. Wait until they release them, IN FULL LENGTH, because they are worth having.This is not what you want."
5,Great Work with Illuminating Commentary,"As someone who has seen the entire Cremaster Cycle in order at the cinema, this DVD is highly recomended as a taste of the entire cycle.The commentary by Barney is rich and detailed, he does not hide behind any philosophical rhetoric and is extremely generous with infomation on the concepts as well as the more practical matters.But if anyone is just waiting to buy the entire DVD set, forget it. Barney sold (extremely) limited editions of the films in glass cases and mounted on materials pertaining to the films, apparently for around one million dollars each, so there is no way that you will be able to buy a complete film on dvd without going to Barney's art dealer with a big wad of cash, what a pity."
1,Not suitable for people with functional cremasters,"Go to www.cremaster.net and download the trailer for the full cremaster cycle. . . . then realize how awesome it looks and how much this dvd sucks. I was wondering where the movie was on this DVD, but then realized you only get a 30 minute clip and can watch lots of alternat shots of the same stuff. The minute long trailer on the website is SOOOOO much better.Highlight: Camera Movement is kool when it moves all slow and stuff."
3,Can't download maps to GARMIN eTrex,"One limitation to note if you have one of the GARMIN GPS receivers with memory for maps (like the eTrex Vista): this product cannot download maps to the eTrex. It can download way points and the like, but not the map information. The map products from GARMIN itself, e.g., the MapSource product line, do allow you to download the map, and quite easily, too."
5,Sexy!,"I was looking for one w/ 11 outlets and found this beaut at a price I couldn't beat. APC's name, coupled with the sleek look made it a no-brainer. It monitors load and quality, and has done an excellent job on my home theatre setup. I'm now utilizing ALL of the outlets on it and it's not even breaking a sweat!"
1,DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!,"I bought this Mp3 player about 5 months ago and it just stopped working. I did nothing to it to provoke it to break. It has a 1 year warranty by iaudio, so I have spent the last 3 days trying to get a hold of the company, but quess what! they don't exist! A phone number leads you to a website that dosen't work, how convienant for cowon to be ripping off consumers with thier crappy products. STAY AWAY FROM ALL COWON PRODUCTS. i just lost 100 dollars!"
2,I Love Toy Trains 7,"I recently purchased this video for my children,and as with most VHS it didn't work properly when I recieved it.The video acted as if it had been off track and i had to spend an hour fixing the track on it,before it would work."
3,A little disappointing,"Being a lifelong Minnesotan I was a little disappointed that there were only a couple of hot dishes in the book that I am familiar with. I know of alot more that would have been better suited for the book. There were too many ""side dishes""."
3,Hints to Terry Brooks,"While I love Terry Brooks' writing style and ordered as many as I could of his books, eventually it was disappointing to me that the main characters met such sticky ends. I wished poor old Walker Boh would have succeeded somehow, and Grianne could have had some happier experiences. Ahren Elessedil led a lonely life and the Elf nation did not know what he did or his ancestress, Wren went through. Each young character also spent too long doubting themselves and I kept on thinking ""get on with it; believe you can do it"". In the end they did it but the greater population never found out. What they did was the stuff of legend, but the legend was never truly passed on to the following generations. Perhaps I just like a happier scenario and I know reality is not like that. But it is not always as dismal as this either."
4,Delightful,"Cilla Black was originally Cilla White of Liverpool, where she was a friend of the early Beatles. She has a distinctive pop sound, with a brassy fortissimo in her vocals that was well suited to the popular ballads of the '60's. She switches from sensitivity to strong willed on a dime. The greatest of the cuts here is Alfie, on which Cilla had the British hit record, recorded with Burt Bacharach himself on piano. Anyone Who Had a Heart is nearly as formidable, and there really isn't a disappointing cut on the CD. Some of the titles are monaural recordings, and they sound a little less fresh than the others. Dusty Springfield and Petula Clark are perhaps better known from this period than is Cilla Black, but Black is an estimable artist who at her best had a distinctive and thrilling sound."
4,The Hard Rock War Against Rap-Core,"The debut from ""Eve To Adam"" is a pleasant breath of fresh air for aggressive music. They retain musical integrity and maturity throughout the CD. If you've had enough of the rap-core war against anything they might think of to complain about then this CD will restore your confidence in hard rock. Why not 5 stars? Well, I think maybe the 2nd album will be there . For now I wil enjoy the initial offering."
5,"'Invisible Girls"" made Visible: A Compelling Read","Invisible Girls, by Patti Feuereisen, is an excellent addition to the literature about sexual abuse and girls. It is wonderfully readable and supportive of young girls and women who are working to understand and accept the truth of their pasts. It is written for girls who have had the experience and uses their own stories to illustrate its points. In reading these stories, I felt deeply moved by the courageous women who shared and was compelled to pass the book along to help others to heal."
2,Smells great; zero lather,"Like everything else Pacifica makes, the scent of the product is hard to beat. That said, if you like a really ""soapy"" experience when you're lathering up, this soap isn't for you. The lather it produces is almost non-existent. Now, that make actually have next-to-nothing with how clean it actually gets you and some might argue that soapy soaps are stripping your skin of essential oils, but for me it wasn't enough."
3,Not Figgy Nor Lingering,"The soap itself is great. It is very sudsy and keeps the skin nice and smooth. It smells very pretty, but the fig scent is not dominating and the scent doesn't really linger after you bathe either. I was looking for a stronger fig scent and a scent that would last a little while. Definitely not worth 4.50 + 5 dollar shipping. If I am going to pay 9.50 for fig soap, I expect to smell like a fig tree. I've used better fig soaps in the past."
3,Needs More,This item needs more improvement. I have to hold my daughter up because the net that comes with it was sinking into the water. There is no back support for the kids. Your kids out grow the tub too quickly for it to be a infant to toddler.
1,Looks better than it works,"This tub looked like it would work great, but I was disappointed with it very quickly. The shower and reservoir are very cheap. The spray from the shower was a little too weak for my liking. It requires 4 AA batteries that are encased in the cheap plastic lid of the reservoir, which doesn't look safe to me. The tub is also too short for my son. He kept sliding down the mesh holder and his legs were right up against the reservoir, kicking it and looking very uncomfortable. He normally likes a bath, but every time I've used this tub, he's cried and fussed."
2,Disappointed by this,"I really wanted this tub because of the shower and when i went to go and used it the motor in the shower siezed and now i am unable to use this. The tub is still great to have, but i would not recommend this product, unless you want to waste money."
1,Even the store said they get lots of returns!,"I purchased this tub yesterday and thankfully the cashier wispered to me to try it well before i'm due because they only have a 90 day return policy and many of them come back. I still wanted to buy it because it seems like a great concept...she was right. The hose is useless, barely puts out any water, the button takes two hands to push (how am I supposed to make sure my newborn positioed correctly with both hands pushing a sprayer), the hose leaks. Its going back to babies r us today."
2,"Good Size, Poor Design","I was not impressed with this tub. As many reviewers note, the shower operation button is in a very inconvenient spot (to operate it while holding it with wet hands, you necessarily interrupt the water flow with your fingers). The tub is also leaky, and with the shower installed, my 5-week-old daughter is already hurting for legroom. Next time I'd go for a simpler, more utilitarian model."
2,Not worth the money,"I bought this tub because of the shower feature, which after the first use never worked again. I tried everything I could to get it to work again but it wouldn't. It also leaks all over the place from the plug, so I can't use it anywhere but inside the bathtub. Which defeats the purpose of havinga portable bathtub. The only two things that I like about it are the sling and the water temperature gauge. If I ever have another child I will be looking for a new tub."
2,Does not drain very well,"The concept of the tub is good, but it does not drain very well. The shower portion takes a long time to pump water, so it takes longer to rinse the baby. Also, the drainage hole is at the bottom of the tub, and is small. It takes a very, very, very long time to drain. I tried using my detachable shower to rinse the baby, and it filled the tub up with water while the drain was open!The best part of the tub is the sling to put a newborn on. Otherwise, I am not happy with this product. And I love Summer Infant Products."
2,Disappointed Twice!!!!,"I thought I was going to love this tub...the first time I used the shower part it was GREAT, but, like the others said, it broke after the second time I tried to use it. I returned it for another tub, hoping it was just a fluke, but the second one NEVER worked! Very annoying--I finally just gave up and took out the shower feature and I use the tub with the sling, which is nice, but I really don't have anything else to compare it to, and it's certainly not worth paying extra for. Don't waste your time and money on this product...the odds are clearly against you getting one that works!!"
1,Disappointed!,"My husband and I bought this tub for our daughter and were very disappointed. At first we thought that the shower function wasn't working because of the batteries but upon replacement the shower head still does not work suffiently. We've been using a cup to rinse her! I wouldn't recommend this tub to anyone, it's a waste of money!"
2,Disappointed in Tub with Shower,I was very disappointed with this item and would not recommend it to any of my family or friends. The shower worked the first time I used it and never again. The soft mat at the bottom kept coming up and my son always slid on the sling that comes with it. There was nothing about this tub that made bathing my son easy. I gave up and never used it again.
1,worthless for the price,"It seemed like a great idea, but the ""shower"" flow was more like a leaky drip. The shower head button was difficult to hold in w/out messing up the little water flow that did trickle out. I also felt the tub itself was too short, and my 7 month old is small for her age. Lastly, the handle that is supposed to be used to hang it up on the shower rod to store/dry the tub, did not fit over my rod. It might fit yours though.For being the more expensive tub out there, I definately do not think it's worth the extra money."
1,NOT A GREAT TUB,"THE SHOWER IS NOT NECESARY I NEVER GOT TO USE IT, THE TUB IS TOO SMALL MY 5 MONTH OLD BABY DOES NOT FIT THERE ANYMORE I'M DISAPPOINTED. I THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO WORK AS GOOD AS THEY SAY BUT NOT TRUE, NOT FOR ME."
3,Good Now..,"Haa.. i feel kinda stupid, i really hated this tub before because the stupid shower didnt work i got it as a hand-me-down from my friend whose child out grew it. from the second i got it the shower didnt work, and the tub isn't anything special. well i was reading these reviews, just to see how other mom's liked it, and i read something about the large amount of screws used to hold the batteries in. OMG!! i didnt even know it took batteries!! LOL. i opended it up and it was missing batteries, after that quick fix it works like a dream..."
3,tub WITHOUT shower,"I never did get the shower to work. When I couldn't get it to work, I put it aside and forgot about it. However, I loved the tub when he was tiny. As a first time mom giving her first baths it was very easy with the little sling. I didn't have a sink big enough and was able to set the whole thing on the counter. As I became more comfortable we moved in into the big tub. He is getting too long for it now. But, once he can sit up by himself it will be ok again for a while."
4,GREAT Customer Service!,"I fell in love with this tub the very first time I used it. The sling sits my newborn upright in a great position to bathe him and he loves the gentle spray. The first tub I had we had trouble with the shower head not working but I wrote a small email to the customer service dept and they sent me a brand new tub at no charge in less than a week! I have had no trouble with the new tub at all. Love the product and love this company, I will buy from them again."
4,Love it,"I love this tub, my daughter loves the shower feature because she can lay in the tub with some warm water and get sprinkled on at the same time, and it's wonderful for not getting soap into her tiny eyes when it comes time to rinse her head...the only thing is that is annoying is that before you can use it again, you have to blow on the shower piece inside because it gets air locked, but that's the only problem with it!"
3,I Wish this idea would have worked!!,"WHen I came across this tub,, I immediately changed my baby registry. I got it home and thought the idea was great, having a separate shower. However, it was nothing that I thought it would be!1. The shower bucket has to be refilled at least twice to bathe the baby completely.2. With the shower bucket in the tub, there is no room for my daughters legs. During her first bath in it at 3 weeks, she had no leg room! Imagine now at 2 months!!3. The sling does fit in my sink which has been useful in the sink but not in the tub.I really wished this idea would have worked. Maybe a Taller water bucket which is not attached to tub?? I am now using only the sling in the sink or the tub alone. I place the shower bucket outside the tub, which falls because the bottom is made to fit in the tub.BOTTOM LINEGO FOR A DIFFERENT BATHING METHOD!"
2,Not Worth it,"When I was about 7 months pregnant I saw this tub in the store and quickly added it to my registry. I wanted this tub so I got two at my shower. Needless to say I am very disappointed with this tub. My daughter was about 8wks old when I used it and the shower feature did not work as well as I thought. To me it is a little to gentle. It took me forever to wash her hair just to rinse the soap out. She is now 17wks and is too long for the infant feature, which is the reclining seat. The shower part stopped working, although there is a disclaimer with it that let's you know the shower is faulty... I should have taken it back along with the other I received and got something all together different. I do not recommend the tub for children under 12 months of age."
1,Don't waste your money!!,"The shower part of the tub is horrible!! It makes noise when it is on, and hardly any water comes out. Mine broke within days of purchasing it. I should have read the reviews first. Don't make the same mistake I did."
2,Tub Okay ... Shower is a gimmick,We purchased this model because of the cool shower feature. The shower worked two or three times. The tub was just fine however why spend an extra $15 for the shower feature that didn't work. At first we left the water container in the tub just so my daughter couold push her feet against it. When she got older and was able to sit up we removed it. At 11 months we just started putting her in the regular tub.
2,Very disappointed.,"I was very disappointed with this tub. The only reason I bought this was because of the shower feature. My son absolutely loved it! However, it stopped working after we used it only about 4 times. I thought maybe it was the batteries I changed them and cleaned the compartment where they go, but it still doesn't work. I called customer service and they said it was probably a kink in the hose, but it is as straight and smooth as ever. I tried everything to get it to work to no avail. I also have to put the sling back outside the tub so my son fits in the tub (he's only 2 months old) and it wobbles and slides around creating extra work. The sling has also started rusting even though I dry it completely off immediately after it's used. I should have just purchased the simple $15 tub, that's all this one is now."
1,VERY Disappointed,"I thought that this was an awesome idea. It could have been constructed a lot differently. The tub itself is great and the insert to lay the baby in works great too. But, the shower part is HORRIBLE! It is impossible to hold the button in and use the shower. It really was poorly constructed."
2,Don't waste your time with the shower,"I love the tub and sling but I find the shower attachment to be a huge waste of time. The water doesn't come out in too good of a stream and the container takes up too much room in the tub. The button that you have to press for the shower should be on the side, it would be easier to use. I have found that a little plastic cup works much better to rinse baby off with. That being said I wish I had just paid a little less and got the model without the shower."
3,"Not bad, but not the best.","The two main complaints I have with this tub is 1. the shower. I don't like it, this was the main reason I bought the tub. It just didn't have enough power. And it takes something like 6 D batteries. It was pretty useless. And 2. the length of the tub could stand to be a few more inches longer. At 3 months my daughter could prop her legs up on the edge of the tub.But all in all it gets the job done. My daughter is now 6 months and we have just learned to work with it."
4,Cool CD--From Beginning to End,"Mellow, groovey, haunting. This albumn indeed fills an evening of listgening with DIVINE EXCESS. Every cut will leave a lingering impression. Well worth the buy to hear these talented musicians, Ron ""Chainsaw"" Bell, and Dee Schore."
1,Inaccurate,"Just like the other reviews point out, this scale is inaccurate. According to this scale, my weight fluctuates within 10 pounds, depending how I stand on the scale. I tested the accuracy by putting weights on it. It read a 40lbs dumbell as being 35lbs and a 80lb as being 73lbs. So it seems the higher you go, the greater the deviation from the actual weight. Wish I had read the previous reviews before purchasing this item."
1,VERY inaccurate,It worked well for a few months then started weighing light by a larger and larger amount as time passed. As of last week I weighed 225 lb at my doctors office and the SC-403 showed that I weighed 173 lb!
2,broke too soon,This scale is beautiful to look at but it broke a few weeks after I bought it. I didn't buy it online and paid a lot of money for it so I was quite disappointed.
1,trifold rack,this product does not stand up. it is rated for 750lbs per each but started to bend the very first time with a 640lb motorcycle. it is not good unless maybe the weight is spread from side to side not on two wheels.
5,You Must Read This Book!,"The following should be noted: I do not like reading about baseball. I detest the genre of science fiction. And I'm not even sure that I passed physics. Oh, and I'm a girl. But for some reason this masculine yet higly accessable tale of fate, physics, and finding oneself caught me in its lyrical snare. You can feel the heat of the setting, the sweat, and the sex emanating from the pages. I haven't felt this way about a protagonist since Howard Roark. Miller is a highly skilled craftsman who deserves to be lauded for this literary tour de force. I'm madly in love with this book, and I recommend it to any man or woman who wants a decent read that isn't the chicklit and dicklit cluttering our bookstore shelves."
5,Excelente ritmo TROPICAL,"El nuevo CD de Arjona de Galeria Caribe esta excelente, presenta un ritmo latino, tropical, caribeño, EXCELENTE, y la mezcla de los ritmos con su estilo de música es genial, el tema prestado de Guaco es estupendo. Es un CD que vale la pena comprar y además tiene 18 canciones. MUY BUENO. Lo mejor de todo es las dos primeras canciones de presentación, son muy reales..."
1,Horrible Food,Get a better food for you hedgehog like Chicken Soup For the cat lover light soul. This is full of corn which they can't digest. It's like feeding your kid candy every day all they can eat. Bah
3,Short & Insufficient,"Teddy Pendergrass was one of the last great voices in R&B before the genre went belly up in the eighties. Teddy delivered both suave and gritty Soul in an era when disco and radio formats started to reign. His performances were at the same time highly erotic and uninhibited macho. With his mighty and gruff pipes he blew away the competition but could be very tender as well. Teddy is best known for his silky albums but was a mean live performer to boot. So naturally any live DVD should be welcomed. But as with many DVD releases of classic Soul artists this release just doesn't suffice. Although I wouldn't want to argue about the quality of the material that is there, which is exhilarating, it just isn't enough. This release features only eight songs and very little interesting bonus material. I guess we'll have to do with this very meager release. But I keep hoping for a DVD that does Teddy justice."
4,"New songs, great energy","The new stuff is really, really good. I heard them play live in LA, which illuminated the songs on the new album. The band has incredible energy. You tell that their hearts are in both the music AND the lyrics. This new album seems to have a lot of inspiration from their travels abroad, as well as the success and different nifty things that have happened to them the past year. I can't pick a favorite just yet, because I'm torn between four different choices! Maybe I'll rewrite my review when I've had the CD a little longer. *g* The thing I'm enjoying most about the new stuff is that it doesn't all sound the same. That's the thing I hate the most when I buy a new CD, but ""Stripped"" has great variety and versatility."
2,Leaks in 2 places.,"When placed on the valve, the pump leaks at the head and at the hose connection. Fail. The footpeg however is durable and the double action is fast."
4,Print Shop Photo Pro 2.0,I like this product & it does what I want it to do. I'm not a professional & only use it for my own personal use & find that it works great for me. I have Windows XP & although it didn't give it as a specification on the label it downloaded just fine on my computer.
5,GARNET'S JOURNEY,I LOVE GARNET SILK'S MUSIC. HIS LYRICS ARE INSPIRING AND TOUCHING. IT TAKES ME TO A SPIRITUAL AND EMOTIONAL LEVEL THAT NO OTHER ARTIST HAS BEFORE. I ENJOY LISTENING TO HIS MUSIC. GOD BLESS GARNET.
5,Fantastic!,"I have never seen Father Ted before. My sister bought it for me as a birthday present. I have watched it in disbelief. It is so funny, I nearly choked laughing. My sister said it arrived well before she expected it to and is very happy with the Amazon service."
5,"Feck, Arse,Drink, Girls","This is the first series of a remarkable collection, Father Jack's words of wisdom makes me laugh everytime i watch this collection. My only problem is that i have seen the original collection when it was first aired on Channel 4 back in 1995, the collection has since been ""Americanized"". The annoying laughter from a recorded audience annoys me because i watched the series before and thankfully it lacked this ""Amercanized"" element. If you are new to the Father Ted series then this added feature will not bother you. If you like this background laughter than yes.. this is definitly for you.."
1,Avoid This One Like Small Pox!,"This is the first disaster from Disconforme involving OST(original sound track) recordings of the film symphonies of ErichWolfgang Korngold. Apparently too cheap to use modern digitalmethods and produce results that one can reasonably appreciatefrom historical recordings, the result is TERRIBLE . Instead, buyE.W. Korngold: The Adventures of Robin Hood, Tsunami TSU 0139."
4,Old idea but decent execution,"The whole book is based on the idea of having monsters defend their homes from the dang humans and such who always come to stomp on them for no clear reason. Although this idea has been around for quite some time, it was even introduced in Dungeon magazine and Polyhedron back in the late 80's, the actual execution of the idea in this book is quite nice."
2,Muddy sound mars otherwise acceptable headphones,"I got these headphones to use during exercising. Their compact, foldable design makes them a pretty good choice for that, and the current Amazon bargain price was acceptable. They're also comfortable enough for that use.However, the sound reproduction is mediocre indeed. It's muddy, and lacks definition in the high end. There's over-emphasis on the bass, but it's not the thumping bass you may be expecting. It's indistinct and fuzzy.I compared them side-by-side with my desktop headphones, which areSony MDR-V6 Monitor Series, admittedly a higher-end product, but the difference was quite dramatic. For a product that claims to be a ""reference"", the JBLs are disappointing. I may use them at the gym, but I won't be using them anywhere else.If you really want good sound, or even decent sound, you should look elsewhere. If you just want something better than earbuds for your MP3 player, then I guess these will do."
4,"good deal for the price, but not close to pro level..","I got these for my brother as a gift. They are definitely a good buy at the current price, but the sound isn't anything close to what an audiophile would expect.. so all in all, these are good for a casual listener who isn't too critical of the sound quality but wants a step up from your run of the mill headphones. Also, they are a bit small with a short cord. They might be a snug fit on some."
3,"Good sound, bad fit","These headphones have very good sound, no booming bass but it does cover a fine range, comparable to some much more expensive Bose models if I dare say, but the difference, and the reason I have scored these so low is that with the JBL are so tight they become painful to wear after a while. As an eyeglass wearer this causes even more trouble for me as the on-ear pieces press my frames into my head. Even without glasses the high pressure constricts my ears and they are red when I remove the 'phones after prolonged use. Sometimes it isn't too noticeable while they remain on but when they are taken off you may feel your ears get a warm sensation as blood rushes into them.Bottom-line: For the price these are a steal when it comes to audio quality (especially since my notebook only has crappy Altec-Lansing speakers) but they are severely lacking in the comfort department, which weighs quite heavily for me."
5,JBL 410 Headphones,Great sounds come out of these headphones however they are a bit small and to some extent uncomfortable if used for hours like watching a movie or two but overall a good pair of headphones.
1,Too tight,"If you have a slightly bigger head than the average, forget this headphone. I can't use it for more than 1 hour because it's too tight. My head starts hurting a lot and I have to take it off."
1,Poorly written book,"I was very confused reading this book. It is not written for a beginner and neither is it written for an expert in data mining. That is, this book does not explain what its audience is. As a result I could not get what I was looking for. I am new to data mining and would have benefitted from an introductory book. I also feel that this book will be of little help to someone who has some knowledge of data mining."
2,suggest not to buy with lot of hopes,i bought it 15 days back and it broke when i am chopping onion.. but its great to cut soft vegetables and even carrot is also good.. but i couldnt cut onions as mentioned.. probably we have to buy the onions from them hahhahaha... i dont suggest buying it for onions.. coz i bought only for onions so that i could save my tears
1,chopper,"I own a ""as seen on TV"" onion chopper that comes with 2 grids, coarse and fine. I LOVE it and ordered 2 more for Xmas gifts. The ones received had only 1 grid and were similar but from a different manufacturer I think....anyhow not the same thing. I returned both to the seller and had to pay over $11 in shipping and then pay to have them returned. Next time I will shop locally."
4,Very useful,Works great on soft veggies. Not recommended for carrots or celery. etc. Not easy to clean--best in dishwasher.. keeps down onion smell.
3,Works in some applications,These extractors were too small for my application but I gave them to my mechanic nephew and he liked them.
2,Not that great,"Not one of the most helpful books about social anxiety, though it does contain some good things. However, in order to reach the more helpful info, I found myself trudging through a fair bit of less useful material. Not to be entirely discounted though, perhaps more helpful would be read it in conjugation with other titles dealing with social anxiety."
5,"This book is outstanding, simply outstanding",Painfully Shy provides the most up-to-date information on social anxiety disorder. I particularly like how the book includes the author's personal experience with social anxiety and how she overcame it. This lends Painfully Shy a credibility far beyond that of most self-help books. The authors understand the problem both personally and professionally.
3,"Supposedly chaotic, yet...","Beneath it all there is a certain structure, it's just too widely-spaced and complex to let most people understand what's going on. Harsh, almost random at times, angry bursts of beats, growling monotonous vocals [like death haiku], washes and waves of powerful drones, static, reverberating frequencies, cycled scorching layers of distortion, etc. It's Japanese industrial, you know what it sounds like. Every now and again a crack opens up beneath the layers of noise and you can hear (and see, in your mind's eye) a vast subterranean landscape rising and falling down below the ocean of electric pulses. You want to disappear into that world. Those moments make the whole thing worthwhile. But even on this surface this is a very entertaining work, and has enough changes and motion to keep noise fans distracted."
2,Halloween wig,"This is a one time use only, personally I did not like it.Probably people out there will be happy. The true is that for the price you can not expect a great quality.The item got home on time, the wig looks better in the picture that in real, and for the piece I think is good.Y Martin770 926-3888"
2,Stila Lip Rouge,The pen tip is incredibly stiff which makes it very difficult to apply the stain. My lips end up a little sore from scratching on the color - the stain did not last very long compared to other long lasting lip stains. I definitely won't be purchasing this product again.
5,Perfect glasses,"These are the perfect size. Not too big, not too small. They are easy to clean and look great! The glass is also really good quality. Looks delicate but is sturdy. Thank you!"
3,great sci-fi funh,i've been looking for this movie for years and i'm glad i finaly found it.it's a fun movie to watch and the effects arn't bad at all for a b-movie.too bad this isn't avalible on dvd.
4,"if you've seen the TV, but not the OVA","WARNING: This is not the Tylor that you're used to. A lot of people in my anime club were lost by the OVA series. It's focused heavily on the peripheral characters, the story does NOT go the direction that most of the TV series fans had hoped it would, and it is 100% serious. The clever/silly humor from the TV series was dropped for a serious story line in the OVA.Now that you have this warning, you're ready to approach these DVD's. It's been a few years since I've seen the fan-subs of the Tylor OVAs, but the DVD quality will be far better than the 10th generation tapes that I have. As I said above, the story is told in a different style from the TV series, but that doesn't mean that it's bad. Taken on their own, I really enjoy them. I just thought I should write this brief warning because, as I said, many fans of the TV series were very disappointed when the characters' motives and actions changed in the OVA."
1,Bad choice for us!,"I needed a steam sterilizer for my baby bottles and I thought that this being big could fit my wide neck Dr. Brown's bottles!I was wrong!It's so hard and tedious to get only five bottles in, and use the lid, without putting in the rest of the items!I am so disappointed!It was cheaper than others, so it is true, you get what you pay for!I am still using it, but this is only because I don't have anything else to use!!!Amy Leea"
4,Great Product -just wish it held more,Great Product! I usually have to use this twice in a row because it does not hold everything I need to sterilize.Other then that it does a good job. I use the dishwasher now only about once a week and use this on the other days.Don't want to run the dishwasher everyday!
2,Not a serious book of literature,"I do not wish to be a dissenting voice but this book is not a serious book in the literary sense. I got the book because Peter Kreeft had described O'Brien as like Dostoyevsky. And, thus my comments must be seen in light of that: I as expecting some outstanding literature. Sorry, Peter, but you are way wide of the mark.This is simply an apocalyptic yarn. The prose is merely ok and the dialogue is hard to take seriously; the english characther is simply not believable nor is Father Elijah. If you want to read fiction dealing with themes of evil, read George Bernanos; he is a master of spirtual fiction. I have not made it half way through this book and I doubt if I will finish it."
5,My faith in decent modern Christian fiction has been renewed,"A year or so ago I swore off current Christian literature because I had such dissappointing experiences with them, from being too simplistic to too unoriginal. Albeit, the Apocalypse theme is not exactly new, O'Brian's take on it was immensely refreshing. I was challenged intellectually and spiritually. And for those who like a lot of rock 'em sock 'em action, you'll find a realistic ""dose"" that is definitely not rated G, but it doesn't go crazy with it. It stays focused, often bringing in other people and situations to accentuate the implications of the story."
4,Interesting but a little far-fetched - I hope.,"I hope things aren't as bad as this book suggests. It has a very ""Catholic"" point of view but its basic plot and premise is one with which any Christian can identify."
4,A New Fan,"This is the first Michael O'Brien book I've purchased and read. I'm a definite fan!A great story that really has it all: faith, tragedy, temptation, and quite a thrill ride. It was much more engaging than the Brian Gail books--even when it got a bit too far into the weeds for my personal taste.I look forward to reading more of O'Brien's books in the near future."
4,Swiffer Sweeper x-Lg/2dry cloths 2 wet mopping cloths,"Love swiffer xlarge mop for laminant floors, however why why why wouldn't they send wet mopping cloths that fit mop? Pain in the neck to use 2 small ones.I use to buy LG MAX WET MOPPING CLOTHS....where are they??dharts"
5,Love it!,"Great CD, very light and fun to listen to. (Check out the preview for track 15 - it's the precursor to ""Groovy Kind of Love"" :) )"
3,Probably the best non-metallic pad for sale,"Worked flawlessly with my PC out of the box. No joystick-axis problem! WinXP recognized a ""USB Dance Pad"".After 5 days of continuous heavy use by myself and young daughters, the pad began to malfunction. The left button would not always respond and would sometimes stick. When the problem started affecting my performance, I returned it.I'm buying a metal pad instead."
4,***Starcraft Campaign Editor Manual***,This manual really helped me bring my maps to the next level. Highly recommend for anyone making their own maps!
3,This book isn't worth $80,"This book covers the very basics of Starcraft that everyone probably knows. It also covers making maps in great detail which is good. Creating custom troops and vehicles gets kind of tricky. Then there are the LOGIC COMMANDS that you have to create to make things work, if you like to write computer languages you will like this part, otherwise god help you because you won't be able to make your creation work at all. This book has lots and lots of SPACE and is worth $30 MAX"
2,Thanks to the miracles of DVD,"Completely forgettable films can be resurrected and beautifully restored. Wow, is this awful. While not uniformly disastrous, it is boring, unfunny, poorly acted, over-produced, weirdly lit, and musically lame. (Except for the glorious La Traviata, but that is badly sung and bizarrely staged.) There is some good dancing (and some frightfully bad dancing) and a weak laugh or two in a couple of comedy sections, but I will be passing this along somewhere.....just gotta figure out who!I bought this as an Astaire fan. He is certainly has all the highlights in this, but small highlights they are. Not worth much."
5,Awesome!,"I am a 15 year old male. Ever since I saw the replacements, this has been one of my favorite songs... Its role in the movie is great. Whenever I hear it, I think of ""He's wiry."" and ""No reason standing around here, out of screaming distance."" Great movie, Great song!"
2,Outdated classic,"I own a copy and have referenced it numerous times. Perhaps I'm too veteran, but I don't look too often anymore. You may still find this book useful, and it certainly is cited very often, but be warned - it was written in 1981. How much has the software industry changed since then?"
4,Classic Required Reading,For those engaged in Software Project Management this book is an excellent reference. Free software available from University of Southern California references this book.
3,Hard read but interesting,I didn't get past the 130th page but what I learned about the CLR and IL in the first chapters was enough to make the price I paid worth it. I wish it were written in a more clear manner.
5,Love it!,"Brushing my 2.5 year old daughter's hair was always a struggle. This spray makes her hair smell lovely and really does help to untangle, much to my and my daughter's happiness! And it has all organic and sustainable grown ingredients. What more can I ask for. Would highly recommend."
1,what happened???,"I bought this stuff a year or so ago for my daughter and loved it. This time, the product left her hair SUPER sticky. Luckily we also bought original sprout miracle detangler and LOVE IT. Buy that instead."
4,Their newest live release,"This album, as I write this, is their newest full-length release. It is not in their alphabet sequence, however. Their latest alphabet release is ""Universal"". This album is not their best live album, but it's not bad, either. The sound quality seems to be the culprit. Of course, Charlie Harper is an expert at getting by on a shoestring budget, even at his ripe old age of 63!"
4,Buffet CD,"Product arrived as ordered ,did not open yet as is Xmas gift.Other itmes also arrived as ordered but are unopened as are gifts."
2,You can Pass...,"I bought this for my trip to Vegas. I love the color but it spreads thin. I thought maybe I received a defective bottle so I bought another, it was still the same. You need at least 3 coats to make it look like something. It's very pretty once applied but you need way too many coats."
4,California Flag,"Flag is of good quality but slightly shorter than 5 feet, but hey you can't have everything. Three. More. Words."
5,ca flag,"This flag is exactly what I expected, and it was described and priced great! It is hanging on my sons bedroom wall, but would work outdoors also!"
1,Ouch...Is this Rancid?,"I give this one star for the one good song on it...BloodclotBuy Rancid's old stuff such as ...And out come the wolves,Let's Go, or self-titled"
1,Xerox masters,"Any body who rates this third rate bunch of copyists with 5 stars really should get out more. Don't compare them to the Clash you bleat, how can you not considering that this sounds like all theese fanboys have ever listened to. Painful imitation, please do not endorse theese people it only encourages them. Oh, and learn to spell."
4,Punk deserves to die......,"Yet refuses to do so! Rancid is certainly the best alternative to The Clash we could hope for so it's best that we embrace the music. Much more vital and thoughtful than Greendays' latest. Check out ""New Dress"" for a great politcal/economic commentary on the current (or everpresent?) state of affairs. Chock full of essential punk vitamins, irons, and minerals. Not a magnum opus, but a welcome cannon shot across the bow during a relatively lame year of music."
3,Should've stayed punk!,"I really, really liked Rancid...that is until I heard this album. I know it doesn't all suck, but when I hear Rancid I want to hear PUNK! Not alternative or ska or reggae. I like those kinds of music but Rancid can't play that kind. They should've stayed punk. Too bad. They lost alot of fans."
4,Tis a good one!,"1st of all, it's a shame that Rancid had to ""prove themselves"" after thsi album and what's more a shame is that they FELT they HAD to. To me that borders on selling out. Selling out doesn't have to do with money.With that aside, I love reggae and I love (real) punk rock. So of course, I like this album a lot. I'm not sure which is my favorite, this or ...And Out Come the Wolves. I think Wolves.In regards to my 1st statement, I have listened to the 2000 ST album one time and haven't picked it up since. I'm sure i will at another time and I'm sure I'm now thought of a trendy Rancid listener. Grow up."
1,Very disappointed,"Received this DVD; got prepared to do this exciting workout - the DVD skipped, jammed the whole way through. Tried it on various DVD players ... I needed to return the product and lost money as the ""product had been opened"" ... Not a satisfied customer indeed."
2,Tracy Anderson Mat Workout,"Not happy at all. When I workout, I like to have a fan on, Tracy talks so low on the DVD, I can't hear her with my fan on. The workout is really boaring also, and DVDs can't be returned if they've been open. Same with her Dance Cardio DVD, she talks really low, it's boaring, lots of ballet moves, and I'm not the ballet type."
3,Time consuming,"Although this workout is delightful in that it doesn't have someone CONSTANTLY talking to you, it is extremely time consuming. The music is great and the surroundings on the set are beautiful. I find Tracy to be a pleasure to listen to as I am not constantly being shouted at. But, if you have minimal to no dance experience, it takes some time just to master one dance sequence, much less all eight. If you are expecting to ""pop"" in the DVD and be able to immediately work out, try again. I'm hoping that I can get all of them down. But I worked on one of the sequences today for nearly two hours and still didn't have it completely down. And I'm not completely uncoordinated either. I found it somewhat discouraging, especially since I am so eager to have a body change. Hopefully, it will get better...."
4,Great Workout!,"This is a challenging workout--which is exactly what I was looking for. It takes a while to learn the combinations, but if you learn the first 3 and then do them and add another each day, you can gradually extend to the full 8. My only complaint is that Tracy actually messes up the combination in song 4 and then again in song 5, so it is a bit annoying because you are hopping into jumping jacks and she is moving on. But on the whole it gives me a great workout. Because the learning takes time, she would benefit by making the learning the combinations part have chapters so that you don't have to fast forward each time you are tackling a new combination. Petty issue I know, but this disk is $30--make it perfect!"
2,Tracy Anderson is too hard to follow,The dances are too hard to follow and she should shout out instruction throughout instead of just running through them at such a fast pace.
1,Studio Space Needed,I found this DVD pretty useless for my front room - you need a large clear space and the ability to pick up dance moves when shown only once. If I had rewound and tried to learn each move I would still be there at midnight tripping over my sofa.
1,Truly dissapointed,"I had read all the reviews and thought that the bad ones were just people that hadn't put in enough effort, but believe me I've tried really hard. I still cannot master the first dance, and I tried for over two weeks. When Tracy does the dance at the full tempo it just doesn't seem to match the moves that she had broken down for you to learn. They're only small differences and I'm sure someone with better dance experience or more co-ordination might be able to do them. I think if one could master the moves it would be great and therefore I am truly dissapointed that I haven't been able to get to grips with it.However I also have the mat workout and her post pregnancy dvd and they are both brilliant. Obviously they're not cardio, but they are really good at toning your trouble spots."
2,Dance Background: Reqired,"I saw Tracy on a TV spot recently and loved what she had to say and what her philosophy seemed to be. I bought the DVD immediately.The first copy I received had non-working audio, but +1 to Amazon for replacing it within two days.Once I was able to use the DVD, I was disappointed. Even though Tracy claims she can take ""anyone"" and do this, having no dance background makes using this effectively pretty much impossible. She runs through the steps slowly at first, but really only one time, and then it's full-out. Then, as the actual workout dance part occurs, it's basically just watching her do all the moves perfectly with hardly any encouragement, reminders, counts, anything.I'll keep trying/practicing, but without a dance background this seems really overwhelming and frustrating."
3,I can't dance so this is a little difficult for me,"I'm sure this is a great video, but I can't dance at all. She does show the moves enough times so that most everyone will get it much quicker than I am, but right now I am still struggling."
2,Tracy Anderson Dance Cardio DVD,I found this workout quite tricky. Even though I once was an aerobics instructor this is a pretty full on dance dvd and I find she doesn't cue the changes very well so you end up getting a bit lost. You can tell she's a dancer but definitely not an aerobics instructor. It's OK once you've mastered her steps.
1,DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME!,"There was so much hype, so much press, so much build-up that the real thing was a true disappointment! Tracy Anderson needs to face the facts, read the plethora of disappointing reviews, and get over herself! This DVD offends the reader's intelligence and fitness experience. As an experienced Dancer I was really offended and disappointed to find that Tracy thinks she does not have to follow the most basic-basics of dance (like an 8-count or calling out the dance moves that people are supposed to be following.. duh, here's a quarter, go buy a clue!). The audience is at home and this DVD should cater to the audience at home, which it clearly does not. Read the reviews. This does not meet even the most basic requirements of a workout DVD's and is a complete waste of money (not to mention risk of injury!)...I do not recommend this DVD to anyone. In fact, I recommend a DO NOT BUY."
4,Great work out!!!!!!,"Very happy with the work out dvds, though purchased only a while ago, can't wait to see the results!!!! This REALLY forces you to get back in shape!!!"
1,FAR too expensive for what you get,"I bought this after seeing a segment of Tracy in the GOOP newsletter. I bought it and worked very hard at learning the dance moves, but I feel like the teaching segments were quick and didn't quite match up to the accelerated speed when she got going. I'm a little let down, quite honestly, and find myself using other dance/cardio DVDs instead of this. When it's 30 dollars for just this dance cardio, I think you're better off picking something else. The dance moves aren't impossible, but the fun factor goes down a bit because they are definitely complicated unless you have a history in dance and unless you're already in decent shape, this will just exasperate you. I can't imagine not being someone who works out every day and trying this."
2,Not What I Expected,"Paid $39.00 w/shipping and it arrived yesterday. So exciting!! However, the DVD is very dull and I'm going to sell it on eBay. I have a dance background and honestly, the routines aren't difficult (though some are kinda wacky) but there's no music while you're going through 40 minutes of walking through the routines. For me, this reduces the value since it's the music that gets me going and makes it fun! Tracy herself doesn't seem to be having fun either. Maybe if she had Gwynneth or Madonna join her it would add some energy to the DVD.All of that said, I would buy Tracy's oufits if they were for sale. Very original."
4,Wife loves it,Whenever my wife can't make it to the gym this is one of her go-to workouts. I don't get too bored watching her use it either.
1,Have not received the item yet,"Its been over a month since I have placed the order, and I have yet notreceived the DVDs. The order was placed on Sep 27th and today is Oct 28th.The only thing I have to write for the review is that on the Amazon site it says, I should get the item by Oct 20th. This was supposed to be shipped within 5-7 days of placing the order.NO tracking number or no visibility into the order. Will not purchase from this vendor again."
4,High impact,"Be aware that this is a high impact workout, with lots of springy, skippy kind of moves. I think if you follow it exactly you end up spending more time mid air than on the floor. My body can't take it (I've had stress fractures before from high impact kick boxing), and I really felt this in my knees, ankles, and lower back, so I'm modifying, but there are no directions on the DVD for modification so I'm just being creative. I don't know if I'll get the same results since there isn't specific explanation that I could understand as to why this cardio method is unique that I could then apply to the modification. Overall, it's fun and bouncy without much cuing."
2,Keep your money,"I actually ran across this movie at Best Buy for only $5. I now know why it was only $5. The movie was horrible and lacked substance. It was shot in a Russian Prison in which all the prisoners were bet on and used as fighters and in the process promised freedom. Instead if you lost then they killed you and if you won they kept betting on you. The film was very low budget. All they did in the movie was fight and do hard time in this Russian prison. The two main characters (shown on the cover) eventually devise an escape plan and with some outside help they are able to break out and become rich in the process. Don't waste your money. Unlike the 2 sequels before, there are no known actors in the movies everyone is a new comer and every one needs to go back to acting school."
3,Not exactly 'modern',"I got this book after having previously purchased Ralph Denyer's Guitar Handbook. I am not sure why this book has ""modern"" in the title - I was looking for a follow up to The Guitar Handbook that would help me learning more classic rock and lead guitar techniques, but struck out on this one.Despite all that, it the material is presented well and introduces scales and chords in a way that is not too fast for the beginner. Those concepts are used in the type of music I play, but in a different context and style of course.If you are looking for something modern in terms of ""modern rock,"" this is not what the book goes into. Perhaps the book is referencing folk tunes that a young guitar player might be interested if they were growing up in the 20's or 30's, but it was not what I was looking for.If you are looking to be more classically or traditionally trained, this may be the book for you."
5,"Buy it!! - and ""get in the groove""!","Even if you don't like New Orleans, funk or jazz I guess you'll like this cd. Those guys swing SO good - it's incredible!! All the tracks are very cool even though they're all different....and this cd contains my favourite wash-up-music, too!! :)"
1,Bio Spot,"Bio Spot is worthless. Don't waste your money. I purchased a six month supply for each of my 11 animals. I have dogs at over 60lbs, 30lbs and under 15lbs. I applied the 1st dose to each animal, 3 wks later I did it again. Each time my animals remain covered in fleas. Durng the last application I made an error and dosed my 8lb dog with the 60lb dogs treatment. I was terrified that my little dog would die however, the dog did not get sick, did not die and still kept her fleas!!! I will never purchase the product again."
1,Never gets hot.,Before I bought this iron I thought the price was too good to be true and there was no way it would work.I was right. The iron NEVER got hot enough to straighten my hair. Spend the extra money.
3,Disappointed,"Peter F. Hamilton has a great talent for creating fantastic and imaginative worlds and populating them with a set of well developed characters. The problem I have with this book is that unlike his ""Mind Star"" novels or even the ""Night's Dawn"" trilogy, the ending [stinks]. Sociopolitical, technology and other issues addressed in this book where not that interesting to me compared with his previous works. The ending seemed anticlimactic and boring."
3,Pretty Good,"This forey into military sci-fi may be in the tradition of Heinlein, but it does not satisfy as well. The universe of the story is quite well done and well thought out, down to the stagnation and issues such a society would face. But it comes off as preachy in many places, lacking the ""ah-ha"" other military sci-fi social commentaries get to.For all that actually happens during the book, it seems very slow paced a read. I don't regret reading it, but I don't think I'll be going back for more."
1,Extremely outdated information,Very misleading. The information provided is from a South that existed 50+ years ago. Some of the material was silly. Don't waste your time/money.
3,Useful but limited advice,"The book has some useful advice on how to distinguish shapes and the possible effect they have on people, as well as very intriguing samples of Patterson's own work, but is limited on several accounts.My main issue with it is that it isn't quite the workshop it presents itself as. It does have some suggestions as to how to go on for creating a workshop yourself, but the guidelines are rather sparse. Granted, getting a concise workshop into a book for a topic such as photography is probably impossible (this isn't trigonometry, where you can easily compare your answers against the correct ones in the back) - nevertheless, it shouldn't be advertised as a ""workshop between covers"" if it is mostly a ""learning to see"" book.What this book does (teaching you to think your composition over before pressing the shutter) it does well. But if you're looking for a workshop, you might have to look elsewhere."
2,Prone to tip,"I had almost the same experience as other reviewers. The wagon was damaged in shipping, front assembly damaged. We had trouble figuring out how to assemble it, and it tipped over with a load because the wheels are narrow tracked. It has begun to rust, being outside, and the tires smell too much to have it inside. However, it does work well on level ground with a heavy load that isn't too high.----This is a follow-up review. I was looking at this wagon yesterday. It is rusting worse than I thought, with the thick paint flecking off with a thorough layer of rust underneath. I don't know how long it will last now. I would give it one star if I could rate it today."
3,Not Heavy Duty,"I purchased this cart for my small farm to use it for carting produce around the barn. Although it has a heavy load rating, I would not consider it very heavy duty. The frame of the cart is decent, but the hardware (nuts, bolts, washers) are of the lowest quality possible. If you need it for occasional use for a not too heavy load it will probably be a good cart, but if you are expecting it to carry a heavy load regularly I would not recommend it. The box was missing a set of parts (wheel spacers) and I called to get a replacement, but they said this part had been on order from China for about 4 months already, and that it would take at least 2 months because the parts are shipped by boat from China to the US. I can use the cart without the spacers, and the service department recommended that I make the spacers out of pvc tubing myself, because they couldn't guarantee that they would get them in."
3,Into the twilight,"In this two story return to the twilight zone we have Upgrade, a story about a mother who wishes secretly that her family were just a little more refined, well sure enough she gets it and realizes maybe she didnt want that after all. While this story has great potential it falls just a bit short. It gets really old listening to her whine thats not my dog for the millionth time.The second story Sensuous Cindy takes it up a notch with a really creepy tale of virtual reality gone wrong. Ben who is getting married is going celibate for a few months so someone takes pity on him and gives him the virtual game Sensuous Cindy. Cindy doesnt quite know when to stop though.Pat Cadigan's trip into the Twilight Zone is definitely worth a rainy day afternoon."
5,For anyone facing extreme sadness or tragedy...,"This book is not just for families and individuals facing cancer and survival. It's for anyone facing life's ""unfairness"" and the extreme sadness that comes into our lives at one time or another. While it is predominantly a Christian based methodolgy, it does offer first hand experience with medical personnel and an approach to manage the disease and all the associated afflictions that occur with any severe illness. This book is a heart wretching and heart warming (sometimes even comical) account of real life drama. It details a positive attitude approach that is enhanced by belief in God that offers a healing of the spirit as well as the body. The author's faith along with the faith of his family demonstrates that God is a source of comfort and relief for everyone: the sick, the dying and the survivors."
5,Perfect,"Since this came as a pack of all 4 season together, I was afraid it would be a giant box or compiled on less discs. It was the original boxes the seasons came in and special features included. The price for this compared to buying all the seasons separate is wonderful.In response to the hilarity of the seasons.. its even better without having to wait between commercials. If you liked the Night Man Cometh episode (who doesn't?!) you get a special feature with the live showing they performed (featuring Danny DeVito's wife). You just can't go wrong with this deal."
2,Well...,"I'll be fair it does have good bands on this CD Two Witches, Eva O,Rosetta Stone,Switchblade Symphony,Gitane Demone and Black Tape For A Blue Girl.. But Cleopatra is always trying to get your money with these box sets, Cleopatra does have good bands but their various artist CD's are plain [bad]. If I were you I would buy the individual artist's CDs.Note: Most of the bands on this disc do not want the label goth.. but the media gives it to them."
5,good value,Quick shipping even at base rate. Fits in charger like OEM. Not used too often but seems to provide same amount of power and duration as OEM.
3,Not what i expected.,"I totally agree with the review by A. Griffiths ""Adrian"" which is very accurate. This is not really a giallo film, the plot is very weak, and it is a bit dull that's why i was a little dissappointed. But the cinematography/photography is stunning, the transfer by Blue Underground is superb, the music by Ennio Morricone great. Also, the direction is very good and has quite a few amazing shots (the close-ups on Dagmar Lassander's blue eyes was awesome). So the film certainly deserves 3,5 stars and is a must for fans of italian cinema."
1,Deceptive,"The picture shows 2 kits. You only get one....That is deceptive. What you get is nothing like the photo. As the ""kit"" didn't really come in a kit. I received everything in a generic Amazon box, loosely packaged and rolling around. It would have been very easy to lose one or two items as some look like paper band-aid wrappers.The bacteria test vial is not labeled at all. Who knows if it is legitimate or not?Overall I would say this thrown together kit probably cost the seller about $3.00. I would look elsewhere for something more professional or clinical."
1,Not really a *drinking* water test kit,This kit is basically a hot tub/fish tank set of tests re-packaged as a drinking water test kit. It doesn't really address the various types of chemicals that need to be screened in drinking water such as Arsenic and many other common toxins.
1,Black Soot,"We were given these candles by my MIL a while back. Loved them until we found that our baby daughter had black stuff around her nostrils. Finally figured out that the candles were doing this when we saw that everything around them was turning black. The scary part is that this residue or soot got onto my daughter's nose by going through the vent between our living room and her nursery! Told MIL about this and sure enough she found that her lamp shade was completely black in the back. I really wanted to like these but that is an incident I just can't get over! Especially since they claim that the best thing about these candles is that there's no soot. Sorry, not in our experience!"
4,"it comes with the price, tons of soot","Great smell and sound, but be ready to clean your fabric, curtains, furniture in a while, cause it produces tons of soot."
2,"Imposter...well, kind of","When I received my order of two WW Fireside candles (one for me and one for a gift), I noticed that the wick on the candle that I received is a ""new plus design!"". Instead of it being a straight wick, as pictured, it is two smaller wood wicks, crossing each each perpendicularly to create a plus sign. I thought, ""Well, this should be okay,"" but it's not. This candle does not burn the same as the straight wick candles I've had from WW. Why misrepresent what you are sending in the photo? I hate when this happens on Amazon. It doesn't say anything in the description either.I would buy WoodWick again, but not this design. It burns poorly, super poorly....and that was the attraction of the previous straight candle wicks I've gotten."
5,"Wheeeee, what a ride!","Amazing cast, beautiful cinematography and smart, funny writing kept me laughing, cringing and wondering what was going to happen next. However, I found that the film was always one step ahead of me and I was fully engaged until the credits rolled. Definitely worth watching but you might not want to watch it with your favorite neighbors!!"
1,No Kate Bush?,"The lack of inclusion of the most amazing debut on American TV by a British superstar, Kate Bush, is dire. I remember seeing that performance, and being blown away, awestruck -- and more than a little enamored -- as she crawled and slinked along a grand piano in a cat suit, as if it was yesterday. And it hasn't been seen since."
5,trumpet lesson assistant,I purchased this electronic metronome for my eleven year old daughter.She LOVES this product! Easy to use!We are very pleased with this purchase.
1,junk,"First time I used it, I turned the knob to adjust the volume, there was a snap, and now no sound at all. Will go with a korg next time."
4,Krusell Genuine Leather Case Classic with Multidapt Sony Ericsson W810i,Krusell Genuine Leather Case Classic with Multidapt Sony Ericsson W810iWorks great with the phone.
3,"Great concept, poor execution","The organization of this book is top-notch. A complete meal on each spread, the shopping list up front, the countdown of preparation steps... perfect. Now, if the recipes were good, it would be my one and only cookbook. I've made about 20 of the meals. Every one left something to be desired, and some were just plain bad. The authors use the phrase ""season to taste"" a lot, and they mean it. We're not just talking salt and pepper. I usually use more of the herbs and spices they do call for and add others of my own. I've also encountered obvious mistakes in several of the recipes. In their quest for a year's worth of different recipes, sometimes they get a little too wacky with the ingredient combos, too."
4,White tights,"They are nice and thick, however, I didn't know they had a hole in the bottom of the foot (intentional, not a defect). It feels a little weird on my feet."
3,I'm disappointed,"So these tights are tighter than most tights I own and when I take these off, they leave my legs feeling like they've been squeezed to death. My legs are not big (based on the size chart I am on the smaller end of the Small/Medium range) so I think this would be hard to fit larger legs. The waistband is rather tight as well, unlike my other tights. These make me look like I have love handles which I don't. I'll only be wearing these with black leotards since it really shows the lines and love handles when I wear light-colored leotards."
5,Perfect Tights,"Very comfortable tights, great for costumes, hides all veins bruises and other imperfections. I'm very white and it blended well with my skin tone so very impressed."
2,7/8? more like 0/8,"darxtar's dancing with the moonlit night is quite possibly the worst thing ive heard in some time. it sounds like a really really awful MIDI composition a 17 year old did after discovering garageband.cinema show almost makes up for the aforementioned loss....but it stops about a minute after the 7/8 starts, which is heartbreaking to say the least.most of the other songs sound like they should either be featured on 'ultra dance 2005' or your local supermarkets background music soundtrack.im giving two stars for originality and humor."
4,Not for the casual reader,"This book is definitely not for a casual reader. It was a compilation of random notes and documents that Tolkien left scattered at his death. Even so, Christopher Tolkien did a fine job of trying to organize this and I got a real in-depth view of how the Lord of the Rings COULD have turned out."
1,Unfinished drafts and scrapped notes,"First off let me say that i absolutely love The Lord of the Rings, The Hobbit, and The Silmarillion. They are easily my favorite books and i have read them all more times then i can count...But i utterly despise The History books.These books are nothing but Tolkiens first rough drafts and his scrapped ideas. He scrapped them for a reason. And i dont think that reason was so his son can milk the franchise into the stratosphere...And another thing about these books is that they are definitely not for everyone. These books are only for the true diehard Tolkien fans and will NOT be enjoyed by anyone else. They are an extremely tough read with footnotes and headers galore.So if you truly live, breath, and sleep Middle-earth then these books might be for you. But i would rather not line Christopher Tolkiens pockets with his late great fathers draft pages and scrapped ideas."
4,Merry Kitschmas is all about the Silly Side...,"Checked this book out from the Library first.... thought it was just silly enough for me to go ahead and purchase...It's just a book that gets us North Westerners through the dark snowy gloom...with a chuckle!If you are looking for sweet crafting ideas, this book probably is not the one for you.. but if you need a laugh...perfect."
2,Crapulescence reigns!,"This is not a celebration of campy Christmas articles that were commonplace in American homes from decades ago. Oh no. Oh no no no...""Kitschmas"" is a collection of actual projects and recipes. None are worthwhile. The Weiner Tree is a disgrace. The ""Franklin Wreath""--made of faux $100.00 bills encircling a photo of Aretha--wow. Incedibly, incredibly stupid.The white trash Christmas menu would only be duplicated by the greatest dolt on the planet. Which makes me believe that the author--whose slim claim to fame is a bit role in one episode of ""Seinfeld""--probably found crafting this trash-heap of a travesty a momentous achievement.This book is crapulescent and should be utterly destroyed."
3,Good Book but hard to find specific stuffs,Good book and nice overview but it is hard to find specific stuffs for Tokyo. Rest of Japan was ok.
5,A product that really works,"I've been remodeling a house that a previous owner made into a rats nest of an electrical job, with single outlets in a room on different circuits than everything else, etc. It was always frustrating finding the correct breaker to turn off. I purchased this tool and it ALWAYS finds the correct breaker. I recommend the tip posted in another review, in that you should make two passes over all the breakers in the box - on the first pass you MIGHT get a false positive (the unit might beep on more than one breaker). On the second pass all false hits are gone, and it only identifies the correct breaker, each and every time. This tool has saved me a lot of time and aggravation."
4,"Circuit Breaker Finder Works, with issues","Overall, I am happy with the performance of this item. The only issue that I found was that the unit had to be re-initialize every time I set it down for more than a couple of minutes."
1,Typical Microsoft Garbage,"The only thing this book accomplishes is to let you know some of the things that can be done with Access. It gives you examples and says copy this and see how it works. It does very little in the way of explaing why or how something works and it does nothing to help you write your own real world code. If you have VBA programming experience you are already far ahead of this book, if you don't it still will not help you. Save your money and look elsewhere."
5,Why didn't someone think of this sooner.,"I have been looking for years for a great way to invest. I'm so glad I finally found this system.I get the prices e-mailed to me every day from the data service in the book, check to see if there are any new trades, and make money. I am spending less than 5 minutes per day just like the book says and last month I made my first profit. I was a little concerned about the price but knowing what I know now I would have paid twice that.I've heard so many people say buy low, sell high. But how low and how high? Finally someone told me. Some books are so vague and subjective that you can never decide when to buy or sell.One TV system that claims to make you rich says to look for paterns. The only paterns I could see were easy when you have the whole chart for months back. But what about at the right of the chart.This is a great systematic aproach. I'm looking forward to a prosperous year."
5,I wish that I had come to this site first.,I wish that I had come to this site first. I had ordered all 4 tines for my tiller from Sears and they could only send me 3 of the 4 pc set. This part was put on backorder and for 3 weeks they tugged me along with the promise that it would be sent the very next day. My garden was waiting and I found this part here and it was even cheaper!! My order came 3 days later and it was exactly what I needed. The part was a genuine Craftsman part! I will definately try Amozon.com first next time.
2,Bothersome @ times.,"This mousepad may seem as a great product but at times the rest becomes a little bit tiresome, and I think it get's in the way of my hand and the mouse. It did take me a great deal of time to get used to this pad but anyone else who use's it has found it in the way and annoying. I have to agree with this, b/c it truly does get into the way of my hand and its a little bit confusing. Also it is much bigger than most mousepad's it takes up a great deal of space."
3,Good but bad,"The knives themselves are good for throwing and stick pretty well. My only complaint is that after about 5 throws a piece one of the knives broke at the ""G"" cutout in the handle. Had the knives not had these stylized cutouts they would be much more durable. The 2 remaining knives are still intact after 50 plus throw a piece."
3,Brittle design but easy to stick,"I love sog products and always find them to be good quality. I was excited to start throwing these right away. They fly great and are easy to throw from the blade or the handle. The problem is that two of them broke. And I'm sure the third one will to if my throw is off. The two that broke in the same spot right where the ""s"" is on the handle. This makes me think that they could to with out the ""sog"" in the handle because it weakens the knife."
3,Name's Too Long,"It's really not a bad catch, but it doesn't exactly roll off the tongue. May I suggest the Laurey PlastiMetaMagnaCatch?"
4,Pure Positivity A Gwan,"With his fourth studio album, ""Universal Struggle"", Bobo Ashanti singjay Anthony B continues to forward the positive vibes he brought to the fore on previous outings such as ""Real Revolutionary"" and ""So Many Things"". There are a number of boomshots on this disc, including ""Zinc Fence Jungle"" (a collaboration with the cherubic singer Luciano), the pleading, prayerful ""Heavy Load"", the cautionary dance tune ""Waan Back"", ""Splifftail"" (a complaint against the ganja-persecuting establishment), the mournful ballad ""Damage"", the upbeat, inspirational ""Jerusalem"", and the nostalgic, ska-infused ""Marley Memories"" and ""Nah Vote Again"".Anthony B is positively fearless. If he sees a social injustice taking place, you'd better believe he's going to call the perpetrator out on it. Big up yuself, Anthony B! May your warcry continue to strike fear in the weakhearts of Babylon! Yagga yagga yo!"
1,It's a book for ignorant people.,"I've bought it only to know what it was written on it. The progression described has the same probability of success of whatever progression you can create by your own. It's written: "" ...lucks runs in streaks"", "" A player cannot afford bad luck for very long..."", "" ...raise the bet as we win."". Luck doesn't exist!!! The probability to win every hand is always the same: it can change ( ""condition"" it by what you know) only counting cards, so probability of success is conditioned. We are in 2005, and still believe in luck!!! ahahahahah! There are only two thing: probability and casuality. If you play knowing probability to win, ""probably"" you will win in the long run. There aren't any miracle progression. This book isn't scientific. It has only a summarised version of basic strategy, some useless progressions, and a little usefull money management... dont buy it... Bye bye"
1,"Trash, Pure and Simple","I loved ""Without You, I'm Nothing"" so much I saw it three times. But once was enough for this garbage. This is Sandra at her absolute worst. She comes across as a foul-mouthed mean spirited... who thinks mocking prayer is the height of cleverness. This film is so unfunny as to be almost an art piece. To be honest, the out-takes are better than the DVD itself. Example: at one point, Sandra becomes irate that the audience isn't laughing enough. Um.....could it be because she wasn't even remotely funny?Don't even go there."
2,Not well designed.,"This dog door was difficult to install because the walls are thicker than the width of the door. I didn't hold this against the product because my house was built in 1928 and is not typical. I am inclined to complain about the design, which leaves something to be desired. The plastic ""sleeve"" is designed so that the screws on the metal frame cannot be anchored into the adjacent wooden wall. Consequently, when the door was shut a few days ago my small to medium size (less than 20 pound) dog simply plowed through it ripping the frame off as he came in. By the way the ""lock"" on the door had already broken for no apparent reason other than that I used it a few times. The spring mechanism just fell apart after about 3 months of use."
3,Fine,Pet Door was returned because it would not fit the existing location without substantial modifications. Will attempt to replace the flaps in the existing door.
4,decent value,"yes, its mostly plastic, but securing bottom and sides with screws to studs makes it rigid enough. Could not justify the Hale at nearly 5 times the price, doubt i will need to replace this 5 times...so far so good"
5,WOW...EASY TO INSTALL...GREAT PRODUCT,I have read most of the reviews on this product (good and bad) and I don't understand why people are unhappy with their purchase. I loved how easy the door was to install. I was installing the door in 98 degree temperature and I did not lose my temper once (which is not normal for me since I am not handy with power tools). The product arrived just as promised and the description for the listing was just perfect. I recommend this product very highly. Thanks.
2,Telescope needs major reinforcement,"I bought the through the wall door for my garage kennel to the outdoor run. Inside looks good, outside looks good but it is cheaply made in the middle and I had to reinforce it with duct tape! I will have to figure out a way now to take one side off and build a support to the plastic telescope. The telescope is actually two pieces of what appears to me to be plastic that either meets or overlaps based on the width of your wall. Very expensive and though it is mostly a sturdy pet door, it doesn't do what I want without modifying it. The manufacturer should really supply a kit of some kind to insert for this purpose."
5,This is perfect for what I wanted.,"It installed easily. Everything you need is included, except the tools. :) It did require something stronger than a jigsaw for the outside wall, but with my neighbor's sawzall and a little help, it was a breeze. My dog loves it and we love watching her come in and out of it. Two thumbs up!"
1,This is 90% plastic!,"Every description of this item is misleading. This is a plastic pet door with aluminum trim. Period. It is not an aluminum frame. The frame, the structure, of this item is ridiculously thin plastic. Stuck to the front and back is rectangle of aluminum for decorative purposes."
5,Jazz documentary for the now,"This takes off where Ken Burns left off, which left you thinking that jazz just died after Miles went electric and Coltrane died. But this amazing documentary is here to show us that jazz is still alive. Love the interviews of all the different artists out there, and it turned me on to so many i haven't heard of. Kept me watching the whole time! A must see for everyone!"
2,Too many performance interruptions...not enough complete performances,"When evaluating jazz music performance I prefer the music to do the talking and minimize the words. If the performers featuring on this DVD were left to play longer this is a five star, but they were constantly interrupted by a narrator or the artist himself trying to define present Jazz in their own abstract or personal terms. Not an easy task, particularly when you ignore or bypass the old icons. Of course not all the interviewers ignored the roots of jazz. The documentary focus too much on interviews and was not able to create a balance between live performance and interview.At the end, one of the narrators mentioned: ""Jazz has a beginning, but not an end"" ...maybe this is an explanation to why the infinite variation in Jazz?"
1,Basically pen and paper functionality,"If you have many rental properties to keep track of, this program doesn't do much to help you, except total the figures you have entered. Basic automatic functions, like adding rent due at the beginning of each month and late fees on a date specified would go a long way to making this a better program. Also a notice function of late rents would be helpful. Another good feature would be some type of interface with the regular Quicken program to save double entries of rents received and expenses. Right now, it is basically a manual journal that you type into your computer rather than write in paper form. Such as it is, by computer or by paper entry, the bookkeeping takes the same amount of time, so no point in spending the money. I expect more from Quicken."
2,One use; haven't tried second one,The first one popped on first use; but it could have hit a thorn bush that blow around here. Haven't tried the second one.
1,Never received,I ordered this months ago and NEVER got it. I wasn't charged for it but I didn't even hear from this company at all. DO NOT order from them!!
3,Jeff Bridges and Andy Griffin provoked my interest,Interesting movie I had not heard of before reading bio and credits of Jeff Bridges career. Not academy award caliber but an entertaining movie with a steady script and interesting and well constructed storyline. I felt it was well acted and was refreshingly different.
4,Works very well.,This product works very well. It picks up most dust easily and effortlessly. I don't know how I cleaned without it but now my place doesn't feel clean if I don't dust with it.
4,My first but definitly not last of McNaught's books,"I had just happen to come along this book one boring fall afternoon and finished it the next day...the characters are all captivating ( i can so relate with Jennifer's fiestiness and pride -- if thats a bad thing, too bad..:)) ) and i fell in love with Roland...he puts a new meaning to tall dark and handsome....this book comes second only to Perfect...the only bad thing i have to say about this novel is that it makes me daydream about when my Roland Westmoeland will come and wisk me away...Bravo Judith....great job"
2,The Worst Romance EVER!!!,"I can't begin to tell you how relieved I felt after I FINALLY finished reading this book. It took me 4 days to read it to the end, where usually it only takes me 2 to 3 days (tops) to finish a romance novel.I had to skim through some parts of the book just to keep myself from falling asleep. Although I found some parts hilarious, where Jennie and her sister slice and dice worriers' shirts and blankets, and all the quarrels between Jennie and Royse, everything else I found dreadfully boring.This book was a total waist of my time and my money! There was NO ROMANCE!!! Since this was the first book I've read by Judith Mcnaught, I am afraid to even look farther into her collection. Any suggestions?"
2,eew.,"I know people swear by this book but I just can't do it. I was recommended this by a friend of mine who's suggestions usually prove reliable but nobody's perfect. I just find the story extremely forgetable, predictable and trite. The heroine is unlikeable. Not to mention The Wolf who's ""sick of the expectations the name entails."" Whatever, I just didn't like it."
4,TRUST is the key word,"Well, good overall flow of the story. The middle part's a bit slow though. But loved the ending, its like you are in that era witnessing the tournament, u will witness the lack of trust of the girl towards her husband but slowly where it finally counts...she stood by his side. Never looking back at her family ...now that's love"
1,A horrible heroine.,The heroine is too annoying to be likable. I pity the poor hero for being so gullible to her and the heroine so blind to her father and clan's people faults.
5,If I could give it more stars I would,"This was my first McNaught book, I really do not like romance, but it blasted my head off. It is a fabulous book!! The characters are great and believeable. Great book. I applaud McNaught for her wonderful writing skill."
4,"If you love Clayton, you'll love his ancestors...","This is a prequel to Whitney, My Love, and it was an excellent foray into medieval romance. A first for me. I enjoyed it from page one, and have kept this on my shelf so I can read it again later. Enjoy."
5,A lot of camcorder for the bread.,"I just got this camcorder and did some filming with it. Thequality of the pictures was very good. The features are excellent also. The microphone picks ups sound well. If itkeeps working the way it is, it's a winner."
4,Well earned 4 stars,"I must say I have had few problems with the ""Fellowes NEATO CD/DVD Labels."" I haven't used many different types of lables so my 4 stars could be based on ignorance. Basically they do what they say they do: You burn a CD, you print a picture on the lable, and then you put the lable on the CD. (My favorites include pictures of national parks, fantasy style battles/dragons, and various other scenery.) I haven't had them cause a CD to not work. Good product. Good price."
4,GREAT CD!,this is a really great CD that almost wants you get up and start dancing. the only thing is that each song is really short (almost less than 3 minutes each) but the CD is still really good and they're songs that you want to keep singing all day........so go out and buy FM static!!!
3,"Good cd, for teenagrs","i'm a huge thousand foot krutch fan, so when i found out they had a side band in a different genre i was excited. but kind of dissappointed when i got the album. nearly every song is about high school dating and partying, which is great if your in high school or middle school. however, the song ""Crazy Mary"" makes up for it all and is just an awesome song on an otherwise boring album."
3,"Alright, but not great","I purchased this cd because I saw the ""Definitely Maybe"" video and it ... simply rocked. Especially because Christian bands ((at least the ones I here of)) mostly don't talk about girls.FM Static is not one of those bands.Eight of their eleven songs ((there's a hidden track)) are about girls. And to put it bluntly, the subject got tired. Very, very tired.I still respect the band because FM Static is only a side project of Thousand Foot Crutch, and it is very possible that they put all the `girl' songs in this cd because they didn't want to put them with the `God' songs. But...I don't know...it doesn't seem...filling.But it is better than some of the mainstream alternates and lots of the songs are quite catchy. And I really don't know what else to say."
5,A Tour De Force Performance By Burt Lancaster!!!,"I first saw this movie back in 1971 when I was 11 years old and it became one of my favourite Western movies. Burt Lancaster gives an amazing powerhouse performance as Bob Valdez, a quiet gentle man who tries to seek monetary compensation for a Mexican widow. Bob is initially a figure of scorn but his name soon becomes synonymous with terror. Like a Hellhound Bob persues Justice and lets nothing get in his way. Mr. Lancaster is backed by a solid performance by Susan Clarke in this film who I have always admired because she always seems to bring some Class into every movie she has appeared in. This movie has it all. Stunning vistas, a few Bad Guys and some great shoot outs. Tell them ""Valdez Is Coming!!!"""
5,Vladez to Tanner: Senor Tanner...that gun in your holster..you shoot me.,"Tanner: Next time. Valdez: NOYou can see exactly what Tanner is thinking. 'This man just killed 11 men in 3 days and without a shadow of a doubt he'll sure as Hell put a bullet in me'. Segundo, Tanner's hired henchman, knows this as well and at this point is relishing watching Tanner squirm in total humiliation.The old saying, don't ever judge a book by its cover, is represented in spades by Burts character, Bob Valdez.Must see movie for anyone who enjoys a rousing revenge movie with a twist in the end."
4,Good Stuff,"Works good, easy to pour into the bed. We have owned waterbeds for 40 years and have always added a water conditioner to them when we have to fill a new matteress."
3,Waterbed Conditioner,"Great product, shipped faster than expected, shipping charges were 2x product cost making a trip to your local store cheaper than buying online."
2,Terribad,"I only gave it 2 stars because I did watch the whole thing, but it wasn't easy. The acting is quite possibly the worst I've ever seen. Characters have the wrong expressions when giving dialogue. Most of the dialogue is off and seems like they are struggling to remember their lines or read a cue card. There's zero emotion of any kind from any of the characters. A freshman who has taken a 101 level communications class would produce a much better movie. You never get to know the victims or the suspect or his reasoning. By the end of the movie I had forgotten who was supposedly murdered or kidnapped but it wouldn't have really mattered anyway. Do yourself a favor avoid this movie."
1,Dosen't work with W490,"I thought this would work with my Motorola W490, but apparently I need version 4.5.6a or something. I should have done more research."
1,Not as advertised!,Am really disappointed. Motorola Phone Tools 4.0 Software CD?? I recieved Motorola Phone Tools 3.0 Software CD and the rest of the disk was all in chinese!!
1,waste of money,"no problem with the shipping and handling, ordering it.Did not work on my computer. You pay for what you get. SAVE your money"
2,Great if it supports your phone.,You can't beat the price but my phone (KRZR k1m) was newer than the version supported on this CD. Motorola emailed me a link to download the newest version though.
2,Wait for something better.,"This allowed me to transfer my contact information from my phone to my computer so that I wouldn't lose the info if something happened to the phone. However, the calendar sync function is terrible. I use Outlook and this program has jumbled the information in Outlook so badly and so often that I have now spent several hours on end trying to correct the problems. I desperately hope that something better comes out, and soon!"
1,Cannot download pics from my phone,"I called Motorolla directly and said I wanted to download pictures from my phone. They said I needed to purchase ""Phone Tools"". After buying it and a lengthy installation I could update/sync my calendar and contacts but no pictures. I called Motorolla back and was told that you can't download pictures with this software. Waste of time!!"
4,Does the job,"It made it happen, now I can download my photos from my phone to computer. The software is a bit slow and not very user friendly but it does the job."
5,Most used of all my cookbooks,"I bought this cookbook for my son who wanted ""easy"" recipes that tasted like complicated ones. My two married daughters looked at it and got one too. I use this one more than any other cookbook I have. (I have a cabinet full of them!) So far we have all loved every recipe. People can't believe that there are only 5 or less ingredients in each one! I have other 5 or less ingredient cookbooks that I haven't liked. Taste of Home's is a home run! If you are just starting out or find your budget or time limited, this is the cookbook to get. I got the last one ""used"" but in great condition. I like the spiral bound version best as it stays open and lies flat."
4,Well-researched & Intriguing,"Due to the lack of surviving information concerning Ward, Carr's book is less biography and more historical portrait of the Taiping Rebellion from Shanghai. Excellent read."
4,Good but......,Turned out to be a really good product but for whatever reason the screws and nuts didn't fit together so I had to go to Home Depot and buy all new screws and nuts. Really easy to put together once everything fit the way it should.
1,Impossible to assemble,"It was easy enough to get the parts together but the nuts and bolts don't connect at all. There is a locking feature on the nuts that make them impossible to tighten. I have to either go to a hardware store and find nuts without the locking ring or ship the whole shebang back to Amazon. After an hour ripping my hands up, customer service said you need to use two crescent wrenches. How do you tighten 8 sets without scratching up the rack? Caveat emptor! There has to be a better way."
1,poor version,This is an edited version . The actress is very steamy and hot but to what end? The story was stupid even for a B-movie/foreign fill buff like me.
2,2 *'s for 2 stand out tracks,EEGGHHH!!! This cd was a dud. I was disappointed by this cd. I listed to the track samples and thought it'd be a good investment. I was wrong. Most of the tracks are basic at best. There's not a whole lot of originality on this one. 2 songs that stand out though are Peven Everett-Makeing me Feel So Good <such a great song> and Gigilo Supreme-Invitation.
4,Good for telling your what your 1st step of action should be.,Good for telling your what your 1st step of action should be. It has simple cases that are very common in practice. The original cases are then expounded upon when one thing is changed. Good book.
4,Review for end of rotation exam,"It appears to be a high yield book that simplifies topics well, I have not taken my exams yet, however, I hope that this book is useful."
3,"Good, but","...still wish I'd used more Pre-test for Surgery clerkship, as well as Pestana. I'd pass on this one if I were to do it again."
5,The best review there is!,"I used five different review books on my clerkship and this was by far my favorite. Compared to Case Files, there are more topics and the format was definitely better."
5,Pac Man World 3,I bought the game for my 6-year old grandson who is an avid game player and has been for 3 years. It was one somehow that he had never owned but had played at his cousin's house. He was ecstatic about receiving it and plays it every day.
1,Weak - couldn't cut fur on my dog,"Bought this to do ""touch up"" trimming on a Havanesse. It couldn't cut it - I had to remove the plastic combs and push the fur against the blade with my thumb to get it to cut at all. Dog wouldn't sit still for much of that.It comes in one of those miserable plastic bubble packages which has to be destroyed to open the product - so I don't know how to return it now."
1,Chang Cheh's Worst Film,"The movie has some of the great Shaw bro actors but with 5 min roles.Chen Kaun Tai has about 12 seconds of fighting, while Lu Feng has maybe a min and gets his (...) kicked to easily.Not enough Kung Fu but if your into kick boxing then you might enjoy it.The DVD quality is what is you can expect from from a dubbed VCR tape to DVD. This is quite normal for a movie of this type and any true kung fu movie collector wouldn't worry about this.I rate movies based upon the content, the actors, and costumes and humour. The quality of the DVD has little to do with how I rate these types of movies.This type of movie is nothing like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon or Iron Monkey. If your looking for movies like that don't bother watching this."
3,works but feels fake.,"this camera works as advertised. made of plastic, very flimsy so have to be careful with installation or you may break it. design and paint look fake to an inquisitive eye. thus, deterrent factor may be low."
1,Cheap look. Motion sensor is not sensible enough.,"It was like a children's toy.The look was very cheap, and you have to be within 2 feet or so to be detected....I recommend nicer model, SVAT ISC200.It looks real, and I liked always blinking red LED."
5,Bukaroo Bonzai As A Kustom Kulture Icon,"Very cool film. Starts off a bit slow- but picks up shortly there after. The overdub dialog is spot on! Beautiful to behold with excellent camera angles and an ethereal, post apocalyptic, dream like quality to the cinematography. Would love to see this on a double feature bill with my own film Hot Rod Girls Save The World. I'm just sorry it took me so long to discover this one."
3,Good and strange postmodern popcorn movie is tainted by DVD,"It's great to see a movie like this being released on DVD so that you the better features and durability. Unfortunately, there aren't very many special features going on with this disc besides the music videos by the Red Elvises. No commentary, or cast interviews, or behind the scenes extras, or production notes. A film like this generates so much curiosity in my mind as to what went into it and it's just a bit disappointing that the DVD didn't have that many extras, that's all. The movie's really good though, if you like bizarre and cheesy movie's"
3,Buddy Holly: Way Of The Samurai,"If you try to pigeonhole ""Six-String Samurai"", it will make your brain spark, sputter and billow smoke like one of those evil computers on ""Star Trek"" that could be defeated by a deliberate overload of its logic circuits. At any rate, if you tend to gravitate toward ""cult"" cinema,I'm sure you'll get a ""kick"" out of this kung fu-western-rock musical-post apocalyptic-mythic-fantasy-adventure-satire.A good music soundtrack and well choreographed action scenes push along a story bereft of much dialogue, while echoes of ""Road Warrior ,""A Boy And His Dog"",and ""Crossroads"" bounce off the canyons of ""Shane"" and ""Red Sun"". The movie could have used some judicious trimming (when are producers going to realize that there's really no shame in a tight 75-minute feature?!) File under ""quirky and low budget"", but quite entertaining."
4,"Good, but awful slow at times","It would get 5 stars just for concept and beautiful execution, but the lack of decent dialog, and the fact that at many times the pace just draaaaaags, forbid it from getting the perfect rating. You still need to see it though."
5,Change Your Life,"By using the principals as outlined in this powerful book, you will be able to change your life for the better. Each tool that is explained, if followed consistantly, will give you a new insight into your life and the changes will be noticable. I am now reviewing the tools and find that what used to be a concern or aggrivation is now viewed from a detached view point and no concern or aggrivation occurs. If you are willing to follow the book's teaching, you will become a person that you like."
1,There's a reason it's the cheapest.,"I bought this light thinking I'd found an incredible deal for such a powerful spot light. When I received it, I found the light output to be quite disappointing. A friends spotlight rated at 1 million CP is at least twice as bright as this."
5,Irie Reggae,I first heard Morgan Heritage on a local college radio station. His natural singing style really attracted me to explore his music further. This is a great album. It combines roots reggae with some more modern elements. Soulful tunes like Down with You reveal Morgan's diverse vocal talents. A wonderful introduction to reggae music beyond Marley. Check it out.
4,You will like this heroine,"This novel kept me interested from the start. The main reason for this is the heroine, a federal agent. She is the type of character you can see having a recurring role in future books. At least I hope she does. A strong, powerful woman in a male dominated environment is sometimes a good thing. When is the sequel coming out?"
2,Typical tale of political intrigue,"Samuel used a common theme, one that has been written about by numeroud other political intrigue authors, and reiterated it. There were no new plot twists, very few coincidences that quicken the pace of the book and very little to recommend this book at all. The ending could be guessed at by the middle of the book and even the manner in which the plot would play out was conventional and boring. The only reason I gave the book a ""2"" was because its main character is a rather sharp, thirty-something year-old woman with enough balls to face the male dominated world of federal enforcement. The book is also remarkably well-written and easy to understand and avoids the major failing of most books in this genre: becoming overly engrossed in technical details. This would make a good book for someone stuck on the tarmac at JFK, but definitely not something with which I would curl up."
2,Same old same old,"Although a couple of the songs sound good, their sound is the typical ""hardcore"" Linkin Park-type of style. Nothing new. If you buy this album you may like it if you aren't looking for anything too original. However, I'm guess that within a year, you'll probably just wind up selling it off at a used CD store or it will go into the place where you keep the other dusty CDs you don't listen to that much. The coolest thing about this band is the name of their band. Their sound, however, is just like what you hear on the radio or see for a month on MTV. Save your money and just have a friend burn a copy. :-)"
4,A great new act from Florida,"Whoa! This is one great cd.Orphan has what lots of nu metal acts lack,melody!One can tell that this act puts different sounds and musical tastes that blend together greatly.From Feel So Stupid to the last track,All I Have Is Me shows really good talent and good creativity.The only reason I did not give it a five is because about three tracks sound alike.Otherwise the talent and maturity is there.They sing from the deep within which really means something.Give it a listen and see."
3,"OK, but flakey","Difficult, or impossible for me, to get a thin coat to dry GLOSSY. I did OK with a thick coat, but for small parts...not good. Lots of gold flake; I might try to find one with finer flakes?"
2,unscholarly,"Readers should approach this book skeptically. Many of the author's assertions are unfounded or poorly organized. He lacks an understanding of French infantry tactics, and his description of them as ""impulse tactics"" is completely incorrect. J. A. Houlding and Robert Quimby provide the reader with more scholarly and well supported analysis of French and British infantry tactics."
2,Horse story,"In a dusty town near the Mexican border, a homesick girl longs for the green fields of her northern California home, but slowly develops an interest in her new surroundings as she tries to nurse a heart-sick rodeo bronc back to health. Lynn's efforts to gentle the hate-filled Loco succeed, but she faces losing her horse when his real owner returns.An unexceptional horse story that fulfills the requirements of this genre, but doesn't do anything special. Usual good illustrations by Sam Savitt."
3,Unsatisfying,"This album was supposed to take the traditional music of Mali and meld it with DJ Culture. Unfortunatly, it sounds canned - as if the producers who made these tracks simply laid down a couple of beats and basslines and layered samples or vocal chants over them. Much of the tribal percussion isn't worked into the heart and soul of the song, and it comes off sounding generic. A couple of exceptions are Llorca's remix of Abdulaye Diabate's ""Foronto"", which I just can't stop listening to, Frederic Galliano (the founder of frikyiwa)'s remix of Neba Solo's ""Noumou Foly"" and German Masters of Minimalism Pole's remix of Labi Traore's ""Sayo"". The rest of the album just isn't worth it..if you're looking for good integration of African Rhythms and deep house music, check out Afronaught, or some of the mix CDs Nightgrooves has been releasing.Or go straight to the roots, and listen to some Fela Kuti."
4,More French than African,"The 2nd Frikyiwa collection is a beautiful marriage of African vocals and chants set against French house beats. The only problem with the CD is that it is more house than world music. The final product is heavily layered and complicated, but still oriented within a house focus. So, all in all, it's a good buy that's billed incorrectly. Buy this album as an African influenced house album, not as Africanized techno. The closest comparison I can think of would be Talvin Singh's ""OK"" album; great drum beats and house rhythms driven by an Asian influence."
5,Fantastic!,"This is an excellent contemporary jazz album, smooth with a bit of funk. Unlike many albums, these tracks don't all sound alike - good variety. I find this to be good energizing music either as background while I'm working or just to relax. It's definitely worth the purchase!"
5,Superb,Great CD and superb quality recording. One of the best 1950's Cds you could buy. Johnny Maestro was one of the great doo wop exponents.
1,NOT SOFT SPOUTS,"These are advertised as NON-SPILL SOFT SPOUTS for 12 month old babies; unfortunately they are NOT soft spouts and they do leak.I ordered four packs of these for my grandson who is transitioning from the bottle to the sippy cup. They might be usefull later, but they are not what we needed now or what we purchased!! This is false advertisement!!!"
4,SEM Vinyl Paint,"The product works when you follow the directions. Dark colors seem to achieve coverage more easily than light. Durability remains a question. If you can use spray paint, you can refresh or recolor your vinyl seats and door panels. I intend to use it again on my other boat's vinyl, so I guess that is the best recommendation I can give this product."
5,Great romantic drama,"I think this was one of Maggie Cheung's best performances. She plays a wannabe actress who is using men to pay for room and board. Kenny Bee plays the taxi driver who ends up with Maggie as his neighbor. They dislike each other at first sight. Slowly, he comes to understand that her life is no cakewalk underneath the glamorous clothes. Nice romance develops between the two despite the hardships that are encountered. Good chemistry between the leads."
4,Not a fishy story,There is nothing fishy about this story of the relationship between an unlicensed cab driver and an aspiring actress during the turbulent 1960s Hong Kong. A must have for Maggie Cheung fans.
1,@ctiveLink is unavailable!,"The Glenayre @ctiveLink is supposed to be a great wireless module, but has been unavailable as a standalone for weeks! I see no reason why the module should be unavailable while the Visor Deluxe bundle is always available."
4,Really loved this game,I bought this game for my nephew. He loves Spongebob. He has been playing it constantly. I am sooo pleased with this game. I highly recommend it.
3,Very Cute Product But....,"It's a very cute product for what it's meant to do, but like all thermal printers it gets worn out over time. I bought two of them, one through amazon and one from eBay. Both had different printing qualities so be aware if you get a crappy one it may just be one that was over used so buy another and it should be better."
5,So cute! Great quality,"I love this set, and the kids love to look at one while I brush their hair with the other, super adorable."
5,Stunning,"We've all read stories that wipe out any trace of energy by trying so hard to be profound. And then there is gorgeous prose that doesn't manage to say much of anything. And then there is Inventing Victor. With pitch-perfect language, fresh takes on familiar insecurities and fantasies, and one wicked sense of humor, this one stays with you long after you're turned the last page. A really stunning debut."
5,Great read!,"I really didn't want to put this book down; it's entertaining from start to finish. Each story feels real (you'll smile and say, ""yeah, I know someone like that!""), and there's subtle humor throughout. It's a great book to settle down with for a few nights. The only bad thing is that it reads so quickly, you'll want more!"
5,"Roughnecks, better than the movie.","While the movie was OK, having read the book severly biased my opinion of it. This CGI animated series just about redeemed Mr. Verhoeven. The stories were pretty good and exciting. Only caught them sporadically when it aired so I was excited when I saw the complete boxed set on sale. So here it is in all of its bug bashing glory. The CGI still looks good, though there are a few rough spots, but I didn't see that detrating from my enjoying the series. Characters were interesting, the action intense, though the gore was kept way down (most of it off-screen or inferred). While this isn't completely true to the novel, it is much more watchable than the live-action."
4,Just good fun. Buy it.,"The constant one-liners are a lot like an action hero comic book, but don't hold that against this box set. The animation is solid, the bad guys are the stuff of nightmares, and even in the future, ""military intelligence"" remains an oxymoron. Add a little pleasantly unexpected philosophy, and you have one of the most under rated TV series I have ever liked enough to watch in 3 consecutive days."
1,All in one....,"Everything you want to know about the Roughnecks are in there... Even years after its creation, the animation is still great. I recommend it to those who want a captivating Sci-Fi story."
2,Ow.,"I really wanted to like this series. I bought it based on a friend's endorsement that it was a lot closer to the book than the movie. And it is closer, but still...The combat in it is a joke. Just like in the movie, humans with what ought to be long-ranged high-powered weapons wind up practically toe-to-toe with the bugs before they start hitting them. The violence is way too tame. I haven't seen anyone die yet, even though people die left and right in the book and the movie. The dated CGI isn't nearly as bad as the awful combat sequences. Someone in an earlier review compared it to ""Band of Brothers."" Um... I don't see the comparison."
3,After the first 100 bugs it is all the same.,"I hoped the Cronicles were like the book.Well, not quite. The philosophical and political issues that are the book's backbone are absent in the series.All that remains are nonsensical scenes of frenetic action.Bugs, bugs and more bugs."
5,Starship Troopers - A Hit,"Roughnecks is the best show period. The animation is spectacular and the story has a very grasping plot. The Roughnecks (led by Lieutenant Razak) fight space bugs which have invaded our solar system (sounds corny, but its really not). From fighting on Pluto to the outer brinks of many galaxies, Starship Troopers adds drama, suspense and humor all in one show (with amazing animation).If anyone (especially sci-fi lovers) hasn't seen the Roughnecks, they're really missing out on one of the greatest television shows ever created.""Live forever apes!"""
4,Good CG for the day bad dialogue,"That sums up most of my feelings towards this rewrite of the Starship troopers universe. It didn't have the harshness or brutality of Heinlen and lacked to proactive scenery and violence of the movie (I know it is a cartoon) additionally all the stories wrap up to neatly to early and the ending to the series is nonexistent, 1 more hour and the show could ahve finished but instead you are left with a cliffhanger."
1,Headache after headache!,"I had great expectations of this software and was sorely disappointed. Documentation and instructions are poor for using the graphics and palette; having to calibrate the printer to print on the Neato company's own labels from THEIR templates is totally insane and maddening--having to adjust them constantly, wasting paper and ink in the process. I would NOT recommend this product at all."
2,Only bought because Imation Sonix stopped making their label,"No where near as easy to use as my old system ,But with trial and error can have a decent amount of control over your Projects.But one interesting thing someone mentioned earlieris that regardless of with system you use these labels can alterthe way DVDs play making them stick and freeze and wondering if its the disks,burner or what..after some experimenting I didconfirm that it was actually the labels I was having so much fun making...It might be the weight but i think its possibly the way the beam shines through the disc and reflects off the white label backing..Dunno but if you all of a sudden start having problems go back to the ""Sharpie"" like I did ;-)"
3,Trading Index Options,"I found the software extremely helpful and working properly. The book, while discussing indexes, speaks to all equity and index options. I made the costly mistake of paying for the Windows version of Option Master Software through the z-shops and could kick myself daily for that error.The software that comes with the book is basic Black & Sholes calculations but unlike Option Master, it offers comparative capabilities and graphing and costs 60%-80% less depending on whether you're a windows or mac userWhile the text is basic, it is encyclopedic compared with the Option Master's redundant and pitiful effort. Unfortunately, Bittman's book should come with some technical support or a supporting website. But all in all, this is a pretty good primer."
1,Wrong Part,"This part did not fit our 1990 Jaguar Vanden Plas as advertised. This was particularly upsetting because, when ordering, Amazon's part description page has a feature where you can enter your vehicle's year, make, and model to confirm that the part would fit. It wasn't close. The quality of the part seemed good, though. We also received good customer service and a quick refund."
5,goodbye red bull,"I have to admit that I love that energy drink, but one or two a day can really add up! I'm a cook, and when I need energy, it's not optional. I wanted to get away from drinking expensive, sugary soda, so I checked the ingredients, and replaced them with a regimen of yerba mate (or coffee), a B complex, and these. I also take piracetam, but that's another review. With this combo, I'm energetic and focused, and not stressed out, through a fourteen hour shift, no problem."
1,Doesn't Last Long,"Of the 10-ish UPSes I've bought in my (short) life, this is the worst. After just a couple months of life, the power went out, and the UPS lasted about 2 minutes. Now, after 3 years, it lasts 1. I just ordered an APC700. My 7-year old APC, just this evening, lasted 6 minutes before the power came back on, but the Belkin was dead in about 1, and the pcs are pretty much identical. Can't recommend this one in good faith."
2,This book alone won't help you pass,"You would not have enough information to pass the 70-77 exam by reading this book. I needed this book and a lot of braindumps from the web. I passed on the first time, but after taking this exam, I KNOW that it couldn't be passed with this book alone. Well, with the only 693 score required to pass, I guess it IS possible...but not likely."
2,Not the greatest study guide for the exam.,"This is not necessary the best study guide for the IIS 3.0 exam. There is too much stuff on this book what doesn't need to be there. The whole book could be only couple chapters long, if it would have the material what I find usefull. If you install IIS to your computer and play around with that for awhile, you will have almost the same knowledge about IIS than after reading this book."
1,Poor Packaging,"The first one ordered, the box came to the door smashed in one corner very badly. Opened box & syrofoam inside was smashed in the corner & battery was badly cracked revealing cell, so I ordered a replacement & the 2nd battery came very poorly packed in a large box with only paper for protection that came to door looking like it was run over by a truck. The battery inside was cracked in 2 places revealing the cell & the other 2 corners the plastic base was broken off! Called back & got a refund. Also, they don't take these back, so the 1st battery I had to dispose of 20 min away at a place that took haz. waste material & now I will have to make the trek again to dispose the 2nd one, and I still need a battery for my truck!"
5,Battery for a Generator,"I purchased this battery for use in a Generac Brand, 13KW air cooled generator. It fits with no modification and cranks the motor with no hesitation. The packaging was robust and the battery suffered no damage as a result of shipping."
2,Disappointment in a box,"Was excited I got a great price, but let down when I opened the package. It looked scuffed before I even wore it. Hate to say this (because I'm Chinese): but it looks like it's made in China. I didn't even try it on. Back it went to Amazon. You have to tell them you're not happy with the defect (poor quality), or else they'll ding you."
3,Very nice holster! Not so nice for the 700wx...,When I got this holster I was really suprised at how nice it was...the structure and soft rubber! I loved it....but very quickly disliked it when it kept letting my $650 Sprint Treo 700wx fall out and scratched the hell out of it...this case was made for the 650...not the 700...Would highly recommend for the 650...but take it from me...don't ruin your precious treo with this holster....
4,Civil War Era Movie,This movies is set during the civil war. I love movies set in the South during this time period. The movie is really goood. I received the product in a quick and efficient manner and will do business again with this seller.
4,Boosts for motivation and inspires,"Although all NLP books are about the same techniques, this one is a bit different, as is written in plain and simple style, no verbal equilibristics and other stuff that sometimes make these kind of books really hard to read.McKenna is a strong marketeer thus the way he presents his ideas is of a very big appeal. Worth reading if you need additional inspiration and motivation. And most of us need it in these times."
1,First bad product,I ordered this thinking that it was the same product in the picture. The picture shos the wrist rest that I currently use and is exteremely wonderful for your wrists. The covering on my wrist rest got separated from the backing after over 10 years of use. I wanted to order another one just like mine and thought that this was it. Boy was I wrong! See the picture that Steven Roman added and it is not like the one they used for this item. Thanks Steve for posting the picture after I ordered it. This item offers no padding whatsoever and is extremely hard on your wrists. Also it has a really strong chemical like smell that is really annoying. This is the first time I was really disappointed with an order through Amazon. Should have listened to M. Arce and M Thorne they were right.
1,"Fellowes Gel Wrist Rest, Graphite/Platinum (91737)","Purchased the Fellowes Gel Wrist Rest, Graphite/Platinum (91737) from Amazon on September 9, 2012. On October 8, 2012 it has a bulge at one end.It has not leaked Gel yet but I will scrap it because it's defective.I would not recommend this product to anyone."
4,Nice outlay with great info and a headto-head strategy.,"I gave this book 4 stars because it will really help you improve your game. The reason it didn't get all 5 stars is because the maps are black and white and hard to read since they are not pictures. They are still readable though. Also, it gives you a step by step strategy for each mission. It will tell you hints for all three races and strategies for any combination of species fighting each other. It also will give you tips for playing on battle.net against other players. It may look too fat for a strategy book but you'll find yourself reading the whole thing."
2,This book doesnt help much at all!,"this book is for total cheaters! It pretty much just has maps telling you everything to do. Its amazing that such a good game cant have as good of a book. It helps you get through the really hard levels with out using codes, just cheating."
1,Save your money,"These are expensive. When they first came out they were expensive, but I tried them anyway. They were great. Were is the key word. Over the years they changed either the formula that they use on them or they use less of it. All they do is push the dust around. A good product gone bad."
5,Homecoming Kids video,My young son just loves this video. We have watched it a lot since it came. We will definitely be looking at more Gaither videos for kids. Thanks for getting it to us in a timely manner.
1,:-?,I bought this for a back packing trip and it did not turn out well. Out of the 30+ people on the trip not one liked the taste. Although if you make according to the directions it is easy to mix up and cook.I would not recommend this product to anyone.
4,"Interesting, lyrically sound ska with a French twist...","The moment you hit play on the first track of this CD, you're treated to a delightful brass-ska hook, and it's all good from there. This first track, titled ""Hailing from Numedal"" and comprised of said hook and a plethora of fascinating lyrics, sets the stage for one great ska CD. Tracks like ""The Great Pie Pols"" and ""Roseleiken"" keep up the snappy, catchy, yet non-mindless image. Ska fans, don't be turned away by seemingly geeky track names. What lies beneath is some great tunes, with nothing so out of the ordinary that you can't at least partially relate to it. While not perfect, definitely an album worth picking up. You won't regret it."
1,Not a real PDA,This is not a real PDA. Can't download applications. Not reliable enough to use for work related activities. Not upgradeable. May be useful as a personal electronic phone book and personal notes.Terrible customer support.Check out the forum on it. Note all the negative comments. Note disappointment in not being able to download applications ( Royal website had claimed that applications can be downloaded. This claim was later removed. )http://www.davinciworld.com/forums.html
5,Laughs,"You will never stop laughing with this one, it's a crazy comedy with all the classic stars included."
2,"Great movie, lousy DVD","I like this movie a lot, which is why I was sooooo disappointed with this DVD. They released the orginal theatrical version, which unfortunately cuts out a lot of great scenes. Please re-release...but as DIRECTORS CUT!"
4,Great Family Film,"Being a baby boomer, I grew up being entertained by the dozens of comedians that appear in this film. This is a road movie which is always popular and this cast of old-time comedians get loads of laughs without vile, vulgar humor that today's comedians rely on. Lots of slap-stick, pratfalls and sight gags with a few surprises thrown in. It's a timeless movie that young children should discover. Great entertainment for the whole family."
4,Nice quality,It came fast and works great. The only downside is that it's missing a few parts. It's a shortened edition. Other then that it's great though.
1,"Funny actors, unfunny movie","I'm not quite sure how you can manage to get so many funny people and make a movie this leaden, but somehow this one manages to do it."
1,Wanted to like it.,"I really wanted to like this DVD. I have the movie on VHS and enjoy it a lot. My reason for rating it so low was that it had almost 23 minutes missing from what was on the restored DVD version, including several memorable Phil Sivers moments. I see no reason why a DVD should offer less than the VHS. Shame on the producers of the DVD. What could they possibly have been thinking?"
1,My favorite movie---my least favorite DVD,"I was greatly disappointed when I sat down to watch this DVD release of It's A Mad ... World. Scenes that I knew should be there were missing. Then I looked at the DVD case and noticed the run time (something I should have done before I bought it). This is NOT the full 182 minute, extended scenes version! Even the overture is missing. Thankfully, I kept my 2-cassette video copy that is the full 182 minute cut. Now I'm hoping MGM releases the extended cut version on DVD.One thing this DVD does have is the hilarious and informative documentary ""Something A Little Less Serious."" If MGM releases the extended version on DVD, I hope they remember the documentary, too."
4,classic,This movie should be defined as a classic. The great cast is endless. This movie was recently remade and called rat race. both are great comedies that can and should be viewed by all.
3,Why NOT the original format?,"This movie is one of the 15-20 movies which were shot using the MGM Camera 65. The widest picture format ever. It is 2.76:1.Its really hard to understand the DVD producers' attitude for clipping a good portion of the original movie to make it fit into the 1.85 standard.You see, almost 1/3 of the width is clipped.Protest these cripled editions.Please release the original formats of the handful MGM Camera 65 movies."
5,"A love sonnet to the California desert... oh, and it's funny","Ever want to know what things looked like back in 1962 ? This movie is not only funny but it stands as a montage of the scenic deserts in Southern California at that time. Okay, so I also happen to live there, But Stanley Kramer has filmed some of the best images I have ever seen of this area. You should see this movie in the wide screen format. I saw the film in the theater as a child and have seen it several other times since on tape. You can get a Critique of this movie anywhere, it's an old story and everyone knows it by now. A cast of thousands in a screwball comedy. But for me, I was mostly taken by the sights. I recommend it totally, even if you're only in the mood for a good Travel film."
1,"If you think Buddy Hackett is funny, you'll love this movie.","Watching the beginning of ""It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World"" is like watching my Grandpa try to play the violin. Some things just don't improve with time. This movie is one of them. It starts out with a car crash in which Jimmy Durante, on his death bed, reveals to three carloads of contentious onlookers the whereabouts of a buried treasure. Durante's death is so poorly acted that you want to jump up on screen and finish him off yourself. His monologue ends with Durante literally kicking a bucket. Oh! Ha ha ha! He KICKED THE BUCKET! Get it?! Things just go downhill from there.If you laugh at Buddy Hackett playing slapfest with Mickey Rooney, or watching a bunch of donut-chugging cops leer at a female's rear end every time she walks by, or Jonathan Winters riding a girl's bicycle down the road, then you'll love this movie and are probably over 60 in physical and/or under 12 in mental age. For everyone else, I recommend something funny."
1,NOT HAPYY,RECEIVED THE DVD DID NOT LOOK AT IT RIGHT AWAY----DECIDED TO VIEW YESTERDAY GUESS WHAQT NO MOVIE
1,"60s Hype, and That's All","Noisy, witless, overblown, tedious, overlong, a waste of actual talent, and above all, VIOLENT. Not a film for kids, it's dated and thank goodness for that. Leonard Maltin is right...big doesn't add up to great. I saw this movie when it was first released and didn't smile once. Just vulgar, noisy claptrap. Ugh."
4,Its a mad mad mad mad ride,"The version I have is 2 videos with nearly a 15 minutes overture, plus a wonderfully animated title sequence. The letterbox format gives the video a quality that man VHS releases lose. The story is simple. 4 people chasing after hidden treasure, soon turns into a small army. Lots of pain insues. Its just plain fun to watch"
4,Super,"This hilarious take on human foibles is one of those epics like ""Around the World In Eighty Days"" that has just about everyone in it. Much of the comedy is slapstick, or raucous shouting. Highly entertaining."
3,"Decent movie, but the DVD could be better","The movie is good, although the technique of substituting an all-star cast for a plot is pretty transparent. (Of course I loved Cannonball Run when I was a kid, so I don't have an excuse for knocking said technique.)The documentary is a nice addition, as is the inclusion of the cinemascope scenes, but a glaring omission is a commentary. You can't tell me that none of those actors in the documentary weren't available to watch the movie again and throw in some on-set or behind-the-scenes anecdotes. Still, it's unlikely they'd come out with a ""Special Edition"", so if you like the movie get this dvd. For me, the facts that Edie Adams is gorgeous and the dvd carries a cheap price convinced me to buy it."
4,"Love the laughs, but I agree the format needs improvement","I agree with everyone here, this is one of the funniest movies ever made. I'm with the other guy who said there was originally 192 minutes in the 1963 premiere - and the aspect ratio was 2.76:1. I have never seen a video release that was ever done correctly, with this running length and aspect ratio. MGM, let's do a full-on correct release finally of this great classic, with every frame restored and packed with special features. Maybe even a featurette on Cinerama and the overall history of widescreen movies would be a good addition on Disc 2. Hey fellow fans, how do we get a letter-writing campaign started at MGM? It worked for Superman II!"
1,Not For Finicky Cats!,"My Tabby cat simply would not touch these things at all. However, let me add that she also will not eat canned cat foods, preferring only the dry varieties."
3,Weak story by a fine author.,"Desmond Bagley is a fine author, one of my personal favorites. But every author, no matter how fine, has to have a least-impressive book, and this is Bagley's. It's a perfectly acceptable action story, but the characters and the setting aren't nearly as captivating as any of his other books. And the deus-ex-machina ending was certainly not up to his usual standards."
4,A good book,"Neil Mannix have a mission in a westafrican country. His mission is to drive a trailer to a oilfield, but that is easier said than done. It start with tribe unrest and develop to a civil war. Mannix is in the middle of the problems.The book is exciting and nice to read if you don't have other things to do. If you like action, this book could be worth a look."
5,SIMPLE INSTALLATION,Really very simple to install in both my wife's RAV4 and my Silverado. Both work like a charm. Now other vehicles take notice and are made aware when they start to wander into my lane two inches from my front fender.
5,Solid construction,"These are some great horns. The quality of their construction is very high and you can feel their high grade components when holding them. Just like most other replacement horns, these are a simple bolt on with a pos and neg plug that should match up to your existing stock lines from your old horns. The installation process,as long as you don't have to remove your bumper, is about 15 minutes if you make it a clean install. I am not sure how loud they are from in front since I haven't had anyone activate it for me, but from in the cabin of the car they seem pretty loud."
1,This is a piece of junk,"I bought the Kaito KA 1102 and it is a great radio except it had motorboating on some frequencies. So I retruned it and bought the KA 1101 since I am mainly interested in the AM broadcast band. This thing is an absolute disaster on the AM band. There is slop from local stations that extends for 100 khz, I am not kidding. Selectivity is non existant and sensitivity isn't much better. By the way it does NOT step in 1 khz steps on the AM band like the description on the Amazon site says it does. I am so disgusted with this thing I am not even going to test the FM or SW bands. It is going back to Amazon. If you want a good AM radio, this isn't it. Buy something else."
4,Good System.,"If you're ready for big booms and bangs, this is the system for you. It connects to PC, DVD players & PS2. The reason i give this 4 stars is that in order to enjoy the full 5.1 sytem on PC, i have to Creative PC-DVD using WinDVD. The sound system is very good and impressive. Must buy for those who are in booms and bangs."
2,This curtain is yellow.,"I selected this curtain to match my color pallete for my bathroom. The picture shows an off white backgroud. When it arrived, the picture on the outside of the package was a beautiful off white and the curtain on the inside was yellow. This was not a problem with my monitor. They are not representing it correctly. The printed pattern on it looks good in the picture, but it is of extremely poor quality. I sent it back."
3,OK...but too much too soon,"The video has clear instructions on dance steps but it does not spend enough time on one dance before going on to the next dance with new steps. There should be at least one full dance routine with the steps learned before bouncing into another dance. Practice makes perfect and there was no time to practice unless you stopped the video and put on your own line dancing music or constantly backed it up. We were somewhat disappointed. A lot of money spent and some of the advanced dance DVD's will never be used. I'm sorry I didn't look into this further before purchasing. My friend, who teaches line dancing, said some of the steps and turns were too complicated for beginners. I would not recommend unless you are already into line dancing and want to learn new and more advanced steps."
2,doesn't keep color,I bought this as a base to hold the water wonders line of plants. It started out great good look and just the size I wanted but the paint did not last long. about 2 months after I placed in the fish tank the color just started dissappeareing and the grey plastic shows all over.
1,This book is one big advertisement.,This book gives you very little usefull information. The author only gives you a preview of the mathematics and no proofs. If you want to accualy use anything in her book you will have to pay for her consulting.
3,"Love it, but beaters bend easily","Okay, I love this mixer. It looks cool and it works hard. The problem I have with it is the beaters bend easily. While mixing a cake mix I stuck a spatula in the bowl and it got tangled in the beaters which ended up busting. Now, I know this is my fault, but I can assure you that if the same thing had happened with my grandmother's KitchenAid mixer, the spatula would have lost and the beaters would be unscathed. I realize that this little mixer costs a fraction of the price of a KitchenAid, but I would have been happier to pay a few dollars more to get beaters that don't bend. As it is, I ordered TWO replacement sets (planning ahead) of beaters from the manufacturer. The beaters were backordered ""due to high demand"" so I'm certain that EuroPro is very much aware that their beaters don't hold up. On the whole, I love this mixer anyway and I keep it on my counter just 'cause it looks cool."
5,"A mans place is in the Kitchen,send the women to work.","Works great. This mixer is very light so I can retrieve it from the top shelf easily. Sorry, no more sexist remarks."
4,Great for dog-mushing,We use this product in Alaska for dog-mushing. It withstands temps to nearly -30 F. Great use of LED technology and saves on batteries! The C battery pack must be kept warm to work properly.
4,Great for the price.........,"Not as powerful as the ""Thumper"" sold at Brookstone, but for the price, it can't be beat. Great value for your buck."
1,LAME DUCK of a book,"This book is a DEFINATE WASTE OF TIME for anyone with even a shred of programming experience. For the absolute newbie, perhaps they will get some good programming concepts explained to them, but forget about learning anything specific to C++. For example, the concept of pointers is only semi-introduced in the last dying pages of the book. I think it's a fraud that the name 'C++' appears in the title."
4,hummingbird,It was a gift for x-mas for my freind and she loved it. She wears a brooch everyday to work .
5,Every Song A Hit,Every song on this CD is a throw back hit. Brenda Russell's songwriting should get more attention; she's excellent.
2,Works great till it rains!,"Easy to use and goes on smooth. Looked great until the rainy season. Be sure to sand, prep and prime the bumpers very well. That should help with adherence."
1,Just awful!,"What a terrific idea and terrible execution.! The exercises were difficult for children to follow, poorly shot and it looked as if the kids in the video couldn't follow the moves either. The production values are cheap - the styles are from the 80's and the entire production seemed to be taped in someone's living room. An awful tape - we are looking to sell ours!"
3,not bad but not great,"simon says have one awesome singer. i really dig his voice. it is strong but not overpowering, emotional and intense and not fake. as for the music, it is good but like the title reads, not great. it is in the vein of nu-metal but lacking the rap element commonly associated with nu-metal. there are however, great harmonies and melodies. if you want to compare simon says then i would have to say they are in the vein of the deftones but simon has enough of thir own style not to be complete copycats.this is their 2nd effort and it is a great departure from their first. their first does not have the strong production and great melodies that this album does but the 2nd album does have alot of weak points and weaker song material. there are some killer riffs and songs but they are far and few between which results in a mediocre album"
4,an amazing volte face from their debut,"simon says debut,""jump start"",was a jumbled slab of poppy rock.so then out came ""shut your breath"" and i decided to check it out.""hey you"" and ""syphon"" made me hit the floor-i couldnt believe this was the same band.the singer was screaming his behind off and the guitars were ripping thru the amps like nothing before.the standout track on here is ""dead weight"".man that song is ill.for as long as it is,not one second is worth skipping.very amazing second and third choruses.anyways,its too bad this band split and didnt move some more albums.this one was good stuff.for fans of deftones,relative ash,and taproot."
2,Not so much.,"I have to admit, as a fan of the local Sacramento music scene I was amped when Simon Says released their new album. While I wasn't exactly crazy about ""Jump Start"", the band showed enough potential to bring me back for Shut Your Breath. Unfortunately, I feel the band really didn't live up to their potential on this album. This one sounds tired and unoriginal, as if the band lost their fire once they got the big corporate backing. I hate to say it, but this album comes off like a really watered down version of the Deftones. Would I recommend this album? Not so much."
5,Check this Excellent Book out!,"Plants of Life/ Plants of Death by Frederick Simoons is a terrific book. I am a garden writer myself (Allergy-Free Gardening) and I appreciate well-written horticultural material.This book is full of unusual and interesting facts and stories that you probably won't find any where else (pregnant women are in special danger from eclipses, garlic warms the body, makes fighter more pugnacious, and increases semen). Garden writers would be wise to own a copy of this for reference. Folks who enjoy gardening, botany, nature and history, will appreciatethis treasure. There are quite a few useful and interesting illustrations in the book but probably what most impresses is the thoroughness of the work. It is obvious that many years of study and research went into this labor of love and the results are evident. I highly recommend Plants of Life/ Plants of Death."
2,it functions...,"I just installed it... - this drive IS very noisy. When watching instructional video, the drive was louder than my speakers. ... I am having trouble with the drive reading the discs. I double klick on the drive letter and it says it's not accessible when CD is in the drive! What I found was that I need to open it within first 10 seconds after putting CD in, otherwise it does not recognize it has something inside. ..."

2,From an Investment Club member,"Having read the NAIC investment club book, Starting and Running a Profitable Investment Club : The Official Guide from the National Association of Investment Clubs, and reading this book, I found the former book much more detailed and useful. I found The Investment Club book to be little more than an endorsement for the former. I would recommend saving your time and money and purchase Starting and Running a Profitable Investment Club : The Official Guide from the National Association of Investment Clubs."
3,Too long a book for too few ideas,"If you've got LOTS of extra time on your hands, this book would be a good use of your time. If you're short on time like most teachers, look to other books for information on assessment. Perhaps with a book club approach, it might be worth it."
2,"Didn't like this ""school""","Teaching my baby this way wasn't suitable. Babies aren't happy. When I first bought a book about the subject (Water Babies: Teach Your Baby the Joys of Water - From Newborn Floating to Toddler Swimming) I thought I need a video as well to *see* things happen. I watched the VHS twice and don't think I will use it again. The book was more fun to follow and it taught me alot of patience as a mother. My baby was happy following the instructions in the pool. To this VHS, teaching comes first, while to the author of the book I mentioned the baby comes first, and that's what I liked about it.I still might recommend this video if your baby is over 2 years old and doesn't like the pool. My baby is under 1 year and maybe it's why I preferred a book with a slower method."
1,Has Serious Audio Drawbacks,"The small size of the ZR20 left everything compact...however Canon chose to place the microphone directly in front of the misplaced video heads (the tapes load from the bottom of the camcorder...a difficult task if you use a tripod). The result...a 'humming' noise so loud that you wont hear your daughter's piano recital from the back of the room, but just the buzzing of your camera. For users who want audio they can hear, skip the ZR20 until Canon fixes the problem."
4,"wonderful style, okay substance","""alice"" is the sort of film that you want made every single year (but only for the style). The style in Alice is absolutely brilliant, Woody's direction is wonderful....(choice of music=INSPIRED!...photography=colorful and vibrant.....pace=fast and furious....) However, I did not care for Joe Mantegna...his constant stuttering is unbearable! He slows the whole film down in parts.A nice story (a bit over stuffed at times), Great performance by Mia Farrow, and, again, a brilliant style!"
1,To good to be true:,"While this CD is inexpensive, it is still not worth the money. It contains almost every song used in the Lethal Weapon movies but not by the original artists. Every song is a cover and this information is not given anywhere in the packaging. This CD would have been so much better if the originals had been used but instead, all you get is bad covers of songs originally done by Eric Clapton, Sting, Bob Dylan, and Elton John. It's not worth it."
3,"Interesting, but...","This is a great book with tidbits of interesting information, but after some quick research, some (a lot) of the stories are actually just urban legends that have been proven false. It still has great stories, but nowhere in the book does it give references or site where or how any of the information was obtained. Fun reading, but don't put it up with the reference books!"
1,Horrible Design - Don't bother,"I returned this immediately. It is a poor design. Once you fill up the lower portion of the rack with cans, as you continue to load the cans, they just roll right off the back of the rack and land on the shelf of the fridge. Don't bother with this product."
1,Poor Design,"Cans roll out from the back and front due to the fact there is no friction to slow down the movement of the cans. A metal can inserted into a slipper,shiny metal holder will have the same effect as a roller coaster. I have one of these in a white vinyl clad and It works like a charm. The cans don't slide or flip out the front or back. The problem is that I can't find the smaller size anymore (15""). The current white clad are over 16"" and will not fit my refridgerator shelf. I returned this purchase the same day."
5,Get Organized,A great product to keep your cans organized. No more cans following and rolling all over the place. Cans are ready at your fingertips.
1,non-usable defective design,"This product will not work for intended use, which is to dispense a can of soda. When the first can (the dispensed can) is removed, the can at the back on the top shelf flies over the guard ( at the back of the first shelf) landing somewhere in the refridgerator. I tested this on a LEVEL quartz countertop to make sure it was not the refridgerators fault. This item was ordered from Amazon and arrived at expected time."
2,iPlay poor quality again!,The pinwheels all clogged with sand after one season and i can't lift the drain out the empty the water. I have to tip it over each time i want to drain it. What a pain. My last iPlay purchase.
5,a instant favorite,"i have probably listened to this cd more than any other in my collection. However i havent in at least 3 years, until i randomly thought about it today. The cd i owned no longer worked, but i decided to buy another.Start to finish a perfect album.I would rate it as my pick for top 10 of all albums that i like.i must have"
5,A Very Good Band,"First of all, this CD's awesome and you should get it. Unwritten Law's music is kind of hard to describe. They got some music and there music isn't too hard....just hard enough. Whatever they're doing, it sounds very good. My favorite songs are Teenage Suicide and Harmonic."
5,Great tool for prayer and discussion for women groups,I use this book in a small women's group. We are enjoying the discussions we have had thus far. The writer skillfully brings the woman she is writing about to life and looks into her life and character and helps us to relate more fully. It is also a great tool for group prayer and reflection. Love it!
4,"""Darin"" to be great","A good product that reveals once again just how good a singer Bobby Darin was. A great variety of songs demonstrates Darin'svirtuosity and finely honed vocal instincts even at a young age when he was still being marketed as a rock singer. Great music, great singing and good production values. A must for Darin fans. Those who have never payed much attention to him need to give this disc a listen."
2,Pretty dry but covers some of the basics,"This little book covers a lot of the basics, but I was hoping to actually see more examples of second homes. Not a pretty book but, as I said, it gives basic information. Just wasn't what I was looking for. I know a lot of home buying and shopping basics, and a lot of it is common sense. I wanted something a little more inspiring."
1,Must be better books out there,Much more useful for information on how to buy a retirement home than how to buy a country house for younger people. Lots of general info on house buying rather than specifics for a vacation property.
5,Mountain shirt - nothing more needed to be said.,"Another great Mountain shirt. Wears and washes forever, great graphics and I love these shirts!Just don't leave one in reach of the dog - they love the leather tags (sigh)."

5,Read this before and now got it as a Kindle Book,"Loved this series when it came out a long time ago. I am replacing the print books when they come out in e-format. Her other works have been good, also."
3,Good for developing fine motor skills and imaginative play,"Bought for my 2.5 yr old son, he enjoys playing with the figures and together we work on the lacing. It holds his attention for about 20 minutes."
2,old memories,"Ive always truly enjoyed my old school music & to remaniss over it, it just brings back the (good) old memories."
2,too progressive,"dj greek does a descent job of the mixing,but I have the problem of it sounding too housy and progressive, also I dont understand why thump chose him I always thaught of him as more house. He is definitly not the right person to do this cd ,Carlos Berrios or Tim Spinnin Schoomer would be a better choice, they would of at least kept the cd at a fast past like dj greek and they would have never lost the true Freestyle flavor. Just an ok cd with good songs.Next time thump records please remember what freestyle is all about,later."
2,Shallow and Disappointing,"Author calls it concise monograph that covers a wide variety of backup and recovery issues with plenty of examples. Well, concerning backup section there are more examples in Books on Line. No backup options are explained (i.e. You would use this option to do this particular thing). Absolutely NO scenarios are given. Only a few basic backup statements without any explanation what to run before and after backup. There is an interesting script ""Monitoring the Completion of a Backup"" - almost 3 pages of code but there is no download option so it is up to the reader to type it in. What a waste of time. Author often makes a point how bad backup and restore practices are in places he did the consulting for. I think they are no better or worse than the books we have to learn from."
4,"Nice, but...","Appearance is very nice, but if the seat is up, when you put it down, the lid comes down with it. (Nothing major, but just a little annoying.) I'm hoping this is because it's new, and that after it's ""broken-in,"" this will fix the problem."
5,The Five Love Languages: Men's Edition: How to Express Heartfelt Commitment to Your Mate,"This Mens's Edition of The Five Love Languages really gets into the depths of understanding how to demonstrate love to each person, based on their own personal make-up. Who would have ever thought that someone would come across such information that actually makes love make actual sense.Heartfelt thanks goes to Dr. Chapman for such inspiring information. It gives people hope both to love, and to love again."
2,I'm sure its good if I could listen to it,"The guy talking on this disk has the most country accent, and I just couldn't listen to it. Hard to take him seriously with that accent."
1,not worth the read!,"My wife and I read this book together and found it very simple, nothing new. People, just use your own common sense and treat each other with love and respect and you will be happy together. Plus just too pious for our tastes."
5,A Love Cook Book!,"Gary Chapman's ""The Five Love Languages"" was a really sincere and instructive read. Chapman believes that all people feel and receive love in one of five ways, and that if you decode your partner's ""love language"" - for example, your signifcant other might be more beholden to compliments rather than gifts, or help with chores, etc. - that by communicating in that language, you can reach him/her with your love. Reading Chapman's book, therefore, has the feel of a cook book, with simple recipes for enhancing your relationship with your loved one.The book reminded me of my favorite relationship book How To Create a Magical Relationship, by Ariel and Shya Kane. Both books emphasize many of the same key points, such as the importance of honesty and true listening. The Kanes, however, feel no need for general decoding of your partners' needs. Rather, these authors support the notion that being in the moment is all that's necessary to love your partner fully."
5,A Fun Way to Learn English!,"I bought this book for a friend years ago in order to help her learn English! The lessons were very entertaining because they revolved around the life of a family. What I liked about the book was that it had the English sentence on top, the Spanish sentence on bottom, and the transliterated sentence in the middle for easy pronunciation. When I realized how much she liked the book and how it was helping her, I bought a second copy in order to help others learn English!"
2,Pretty....but Pretty Stupid,"Amour is a kind of good idea for a show but the CD is not. Much of the score is pretty and a lot of the cast sounds great but I tell you the lyrics are the worst I have ever heard on a cast recording. I understand that it is a translation but there is no excuse for some of the AWFUL lyrics. Theres one embaressing song about ""taking the plunge"" and it stands as one of the worst theater songs I have ever heard. Here's an excerpt from it.... ""How about taking the P-L-U-N-Geez Louise! And unless she is a foolish cow, she will be waiting for you now...Oh Wow! How about taking the, Making the, Breaking the, How about taking the plunge!"" Melissa Errico and Sarah Litzinger are very good on this cd so long as you don't listen to what they're singing. Malcolm Gets is good i guess and the rest of the cast is pretty bland. I would not spend money on this cd."
5,LE GRAND AMOUR,"I now understand why AMOUR was nominated for Best Musical, Best Book, and Best Original Score at the 2002 TONY Awards. It is a sweet, almost abstract, sung-through musical - in the Legrand tradition of ""Umbrellas of Cherbourg""; a truly charming, albeit unconventional, and ... well ... sort-of-French-though-it's-in-English-musical. Although it lasted for only 31 previews and 17 performances on Broadway, someone had the good sense to bring the original cast back together 6 months later for this recording. A wonderful, eminently listenable, and infectious recording. This Broadway collector's delight has full liner notes and libretto!!"
4,excellent torch singer.,we like the new torchy approach that gypsy&reno has given to old jazz classics. smokey and vibrant.
3,Okay but way too salty for me,"I have used Fantastic Foods products in the past, notably the sloppy joe mix, but this chili mix is so salty I am up all night going into the kitchen for water. Also, and I noticed this with the sloppy joe mix too, the clear bag inside of the box gives way so that some of the mix spills out and I assume this would impact the freshness. I finally ended up dumping all the bags out into one airtight container and when i use it I just scoop out what I think I need with a measuring cup. I find I can use it in soup to add texture and being in soup the salty-ness is diluted. I won't buy it again."
5,Best darn chili hands down,Fantastic makes the best vegetarian chili it's quick and ez and not even my Carnivours miss the meat. Spice it up with green chiles and folks. Will be singing your praises
3,Problem with packaging,"Package had staplles put thru product , which caused holes in chamois. These holes will get bigger as chamois is used. would have to cut chamois to stop this."
4,"Great value, but not really self propelled.","I have a lakeside area with lots of acorns and walnuts in the north woods of Wisconsin, which after one pass, are completely removed and no longer a bother. The vaccuum is strong enough to lift small twigs and nuts from the ground in one pass, so it does it's job. The self propelled feature is not so hardy. My vac pull to the right constantly, I believe only the left rear wheel is power driven. There appears to be a small differential casing, but it's very dainty and may be broken after only several uses. For the money, this little machine really cleans up, and will make no work at all out of leaves and grass. It's a good value for me, and is perfect for small areas (<1 acre) with lots of manicured trees. The flywheel is directly connected to the motor shaft, so it's a bit of a challenge to get it started with a pull rope, especially when very cold."
4,"Not a lot of frills, but very good","There's not a lot to this metal organizer, but it holds all my gold things in 1 place. I do like the shelves for my shoes and even extra sleeves of balls. I have had this for over 4 years and it is still in perfect condition. It is well made and easy to put together."
1,Missing parts and manual!,"Well I was so happy that I found something that I could build/give to my dad for fathers day.The only problem was that it had NO manual to build or screws!I had to figure it out by the picture and go to Lowes to purchase screws.Normally I would have returned it but, it was too late and I wanted him to have this as a gift.In conclusion, it was a good item after I finished building it.However, I very unhappy at the missing parts.Not worth the money if parts come missing like this...Thankfully, Amazon has an AMAZING customer service and gave me a partial refund for the amount of money I spent to purchase a new set of screws.I hope that this company gets a deduction from Amazon for refunding me!"
4,awesome,"This is a must have if you haven't read the New Jedi Order series yet. The first book, Vector Prime really gets things started and is the best so far. The other two, are decent. Luke, Mara, and all the rest of the characters are portrayed really well in these three. Exciting books."
1,Not the Original Four Tops Recordings,"If you want the original recordings of the Four Tops songs, then DO NOT order this CD. I don't know where or when these songs were recorded, but they are absolutely awful! They are nothing like the original recordings."
5,good,"These work well. Very good connection. I get nervous with usb extensions due to prior experience, but these are great."
4,dosh makes me happy,"Dosh has a great sound. Even without words this music drips gallons of emotion. This is his solo album but he plays in other really fantastic bands, fog (ninja tune) and lateduster (www.firetrunk.com) ""Delicate arrangements sweep listeners into moody soundscapes that ebb and flow with focused abandon."" -St Paul Pioneer Press. For more dosh info http://www.anticon.com/I can't wait to hear the next album!"
3,"Good cool, few per package","My kids love temporary tattoos and I thought I'd give these a try. I was under the impression I would get more than I did in the package, but it turned out to be two sheets. The designs were fairly standard but there seemed to be quite a few dragons that resembled something more Nordic than Chinese. They did indeed stick to skin just fine though. And they stayed there and held their shape and design much longer than any other brand I have used. So while you get fewer if you are looking for a more robust, longer lasting temporary tattoo. Then these may suit you well."
2,"Disappointing Film, But Bruce Campbell Is Great","I had really hoped that this little film would have more to deliver. It seems to have a cast of about 10 people, and the evil mummy (inexplicably wearing a cowboy outfit) looks no better than Halloween costumes in the $100 range. Special effects? Hmm...I think not. (Hey, here's a wild idea - if you're going to put a giant scarab beetle in your movie, how about building one with legs that move?)That being said, Bruce Campbell is terrific playing the aged and crusty Elvis Presley. I was expecting his performance to be pure over-the-top camp, but it was funny, sympathetic and thoroughly believable. The film is worth seeing just for his performance, and you'll wish that the rest of the production was worthy of all he brings to the role."
4,The King of Rock N' Roll vs. The Mummy...with a little help from JFK,"Bruce Campbell plays a slightly deranged, former Elvis impersonator (or is he, as he claims, really Elvis?) who is spending his last days at an old age home in Texas. He teams up with another senior citizen at the home, a Black man who thinks he's JFK, to take on an Egyptian mummy that has been killing residents and sucking out their souls for sustenance. (I kept waiting for Jim Morrison to make an appearance, but he does not....)This somewhat strange comedy isn't for everyone. If you like independent, off-beat films such as Jim Jarmusch's early comedies or Andy Kaufman's ""My Breakfast with Blassie,"" then you should like this flick. BUBBA HO-TEP is destined to become a cult classic (if it isn't one already)."
3,Derivative entertainment,"Yes, it's a funny premise: Elvis is living in a nursing home with a resident who thinks he's JFK and another who fancies himself the Lone Ranger. In the meantime, an ancient Egyptian demon wants to suck the souls out of the old and sickly folks, so it's up to Elvis and Jack to stop the demon.Bruce Campbell and Ossie Davis are great. But somehow, the story lacks the sense of urgency that a horror tale should have, and although there are many funny lines, it could have been stronger comedically. The writer/director also seems to borrow heavily from the works of the Raimi brothers and their friends the Coen Brothers instead of being more original.Okay for a few laughs, but not as good as it might have been."
4,"Delightful, original and memorable","I heard about this film via an NPR interview with Bruce Campbell, and was intrigued. When I got to see the DVD, I was not at all disappointed. A zany and original script comes to life thanks to tour-de-force performances by Campbell and Ossie Davis, who obviously enjoyed working together."
2,A Big Disappointment!,"Don't waste your money. I thought I was a big Bruce Campbell fan but I guess I don't like sh*t, even Bruce Campbell's sh*t. A big disappointment."
3,"Different, but I don't need my own copy","I divide movies into 3 groups: 1. Too stupid to even watch on TV (about 1/4), 2. Wait until I can rent it or until it hits TV (about 5/8), and 3. Interesting enough to want my own copy (remaining 1/8). This story originally was in the 1st group, but Amazon.com and a few co-workers said they liked it so I rented it. I'd never want to own a copy, even if it made it to the $5 bin, but it makes a pleasant divirsion. Plot is simply odd enough and the acting is strong enough to hold your interest. Excellent acting is the movie's strongest point."
5,movie is great,love this movieif you are a bruce campbell fan you have to see itits weird and hilarious and not your run of the mill moviealso not a horror movie like he usually makesmore of a spoofy horror movie
5,this edition has many special features...,"but that is not why its great. well, thats part of it. its only fitting a movie about old people would be sort of slow. the inside-the-head narration bruce does pondering his topsy-turvy life is very genuine. the music is charming and done by the same fella who did the music for the six string samurai soundtrack. everything that the red elvises did not do. anyway, to be truthful its a very unusual but well worth your time. way better than your usual senior citizn horror film."
4,Elvis should be proud,"Bruce Campbell morphs into Elvis! This is a must for Campbell and Elvis fans. It's absurd, funny, and touching at the same time. Although it's not as good as ""Army of Darkness"", it's still definitely worth the time."
1,How can so many people be wrong???,"I'm a big fan of low budget camp, but this is just plain boring. Bruce Campell does a good job of portraying Elvis and that's about the only good thing I can say about this flick. The movie just drraaagggs along. Nothing really happens and even the final showdown with Ho-Tep at the end is anti-climatic. I was expecting low-budget effects, but not this bad. The scarab beetle looks like a rubber bug bought at the local dollar store and dragged across the floor with a string. I rented this disaster based on the recommendation of the reviews on Amazon. Are there really that many people starved for entertainment that they could actually give this movie more than one star?"
1,BOREDOM HO-TEP,"Bubba Ho-Tep is a disappointing timewaster that it looks like another nadir(low point) on Bruce Campbell's resume and an embarassment on director Don Coscarelli's resume. This movie had a good idea but ruined by bad acting,low production values,and mediocre special effects. The badly written plot deals with Elvis Presley(Campbell) and a black JFK(Ossie Davis in a wasted role) trying to fight a mummy sucking the souls from patients. Bubba Ho-Tep had potential but never used it and the movie becomes an unwatchable mess that looks like a made for tv movie that would be shown on TV. Bubba Ho Tep is a boring movie."
3,3 Stars for Campbell's acting,"Although ""Bubba Ho-tep"" had all the makings of a classic b-rated horror flick with even the king of b-rated movies in the star role it just didn't do it for me. Bruce Campbell's praiseworthy performance was the only thing about this film that was laudable and a few of his scenes as a sleazy bedridden geriatric Elvis were highly amusing, butthe humor is, most of the time, low brow and childish."
5,Bruce Campbell Is the King of B!!!,"Go Buy this now,Baby!!!New Cult classic!Yeah...Elvis has left the building.................Bruce rules!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Bruce Campbell does it again!,"Bruce Campbell does it again in Bubba Ho-tep. Even though it is completely different from his ""Ash"" character in the Evil Dead movies, his Elvis-impersonating character in this movie will surely gather a cult following. Just as we are used to, his one-liners and quirky sayings will keep you laughing long after the movie is over. The story line is pretty ridiculous, but what did you expect? I definitely recommend this movie."
2,Vaguely Entertaining,Not sure what to make of the movie but it is definitely not one of the best movies and not sure if it is even a movie.
5,"The alarming history of medicine,,,the book",Great read. Could have done without a little of the author's opinions but still a fantastic book...full of cool info.
1,"So painful, you'll need an anesthetic","Reading this book was like trying to walk through waist-deep mud. It is so weighted down with extra, unnecessary words that it just doesn't flow at all. Disappointed, I finally gave up around page 50. Reading Biochemistry was easier & more fun, & that's not saying much!"
5,Muy bueno !,"Es un libro muy bueno, ademas de ser un clasico en NumericalMethods in Subsurface Hydrology."
3,Heavily relied on Software decoder,"Cheap! This is your DVD if you're financially strapped. OEM of Pioneer DVD-113 drive. There were some reference on usenet about DMA problems, and I experienced it. Disabling use of DMA fixed that.This is actually an okay drive. Comes with a software decoder. If your system is slower than P-II-400 (100Mhz bus), then the software decoder will suffice. If you do not, than get a hardware decoder. Includes PowerDVD software decoder. Will work better with WinDVD.To enjoy the movie, you should get a surround sound speakers with good amplified base unit, a BIG monitor, and bag of popcorn!"
1,It was extremely difficult to understand Austin's voice.,"This video was no good at all. The reason is because it took place with Austin in a truck on a freeway. Basically, it was to hard to understand what he was saying."
2,Great...Till it breaks,Looks great and worked great for approximately 6 months. Then the cheap plastic notches that hold it up broke. I have it about 3/4 full of only ties (no belts) and that was too much weight for the plastic notches that clip the top portion to the bottom.
1,Cheap,"I ordered this item as a replacement for a more expensive motorized tie rack that quit working. Guess you get what you pay for. The installation design is problematic if you have a shelving unit above the bar you are installing it on. I had to actually remove the shelf because the two tightening screws are too tall. When I was tightening the screws, I heard a crack and the unit began to sag on one side. I removed the unit only to discover that the tabs on the top cap had broken off. Pretty damned cheap as I did not even apply that much pressure when tightening the screws. My unit now has superglue and gorilla tape on it, but it's installed and working. The motor on this thing sounds terrible and is extremely slow. We'll see how long it lasts. Wouldn't purchase again."
2,Misnamed,"This mask doesn't seem to do much clarifying or detoxification. Makes skin feel slightly firmer for a few hours, but definitely not a deeply purifying mask. Or even one that cleanses pores. Didn't make my skin look or feel worse, so I'll go with 2 stars."
4,Good Gift,This was purchased as a gift. Reports are that it was good quality if you like old-time gospel and religious bluegrass music.
5,Loves Bluegrass Gospel,"My husband and 19 year old daughter Love this album.I even enjoy too! lolIf you enjoy bluegrass and old time gospel, you'll enjoy this album."
1,Let Him Rest In Peace,"Here we go again... Rehashing the possibility of Lincoln's homosexuality. As a Lincoln scholar and student of 19th Century culture, I find this book to be highly undocumented and unsubstantiated. If there is some hidden or sublimnal sexual meaning in the letters, etc. in this book, I have failed to grasp them.We are discussing the 19th Century...not the 21st Century. Yes, Lincoln slept with other men, as did the soldiers, etc. Beds were shared in boarding houses, men shared comraderie, women danced with one another, held hands in public. Does this make them a homosexual?Whether Lincoln was heterosexual, homosexual or Bisexual...does any of it really matter? Let him rest in peace.As I stated before, this is simply rehashed maybes that have been touched upon in a number of Lincoln biographies and other books."
4,Listen more than once -- there is heart here.,"I discovered Susan Werner in ""Last of the Good Straight Girls"" -- at the same time I realized my husband was an alcoholic. She spoke to me then and got me through some difficult days and nights.Now here she is again with ""Time Between Trains""....inside my head, inside my heart. She says, as I've been saying, ""I still love you,....but I can't let you in.""The sound of the music is different, eclectic, jazz-edged at times, scattered even, but it reflects exactly how people in transition feel and react.This CD talks to people in pain who care about others in pain. Listen more than once because it grows on you and then touches you."
4,uneven,"This is a well-produced but uneven album from a multi-talented artist.Although this showcases Werner's wide range, the writing is uneven, and sometimes heavy handed.When she is good, she is terrific-as in the title track,""My Favourite Mistake"" and ""Standing in My Own Way"".The hidden track gives the listener a taste of the delicious humor so evident in Werner's live performances.Indeed, as a live performer, Susan Werner shouldnt be missed.This CD just doesnt do sufficient justice to her many talents."
4,Having never listened to the Broadway album...,"I liked this version a lot. Yes, I'm sure three years must have worn on everyone's voice somewhat, but they all sound fine to me here. Hearing Rex Harrison's patter, Julie Andrews' astonishing range, and Stanley Holloway's music-hall style is quite thrilling and most enjoyable to me, especially since I get to listen to that marvelous Lerner and Loewe score at the same time. Yes, there were some (MINOR) problems with the sound, but they did not detract much from my enjoyment of this recording. I'm sure the Broadway album is probably fresher and better, but this one is not a bad substitute at all."
5,Slightly Miffed,"I am and always will be a true fan of U2, but I felt a little cheated when I bought the ""Deluxe"" edition for 30 bucks only to find out that if you down load it from itunes you get an extra track. Other than that the book is fantastic and I like the one new track ""windows.."". The dvd rocks too. Definitely worth the money if you are a true fan."
4,Enjoyable light read,"While I do agree the first part of the book was a tad slow, overall I found the book to be very enjoyable. A great murder mystery for those who don't want their murders too gruesome or complicated."
5,Amazing!,"Along with ""til Shiloh"" are probably the best regae albums ever! A mix of the best of bob Marley and Beenie man! If you are to own any regae cd's get ""Inna Heights"" and ""til Shiloh"", they are amazing!"
2,Where's the Jeopardy?!!!!!,"All right, I have always loved SNL, and especially the Celebrity Jeopardy's. There was only a single CJ episode at the end of the tape! I feel that with the exception of the guess the word game, the tape should be wiped clean of the waste on it now and filled with stuff that...gasp!...people actually want to see! My ideal: I must agree with another [person] when I say a tape full of Celebrity Jeopardy. Do not waste your money on this, simply tape skits off the air if it means that much to you."
2,Memory Cassette,"Not bad. Kind of the type of voice they would caricature on the simpsons. The actual systems do work, but for value for money you are better off with one of the books."
4,Improve my what?,"This is a funny tape. I had fun with it. It improves your , ah what was I talking about? Oh yeah improves your memory. $.38 what the heck. It was fun though."
3,I'm sorry Mr. and Mrs. Aubrac,"It pains me to give this only 3 stars because I so admire it's authors. Please forgive me Lucie and Raymond! The idea of a collection of pictures to document the French Resistance is outstanding and there should be more books like this available in this country. The English version of this however, left me a bit disappointed. There were all sorts of pictures: Some you may have seen before, some you probably have not, some very candid, and others (even combat photos) clearly staged. And while there are some excellent photos of posters and propaganda papers, there are no English translations of the headlines. Perhaps I should learn French. I have that on my list, do not worry! And as for the captions, I wish there were more. Please give us a second edition with more details and captions. Tell us more, tell us all! The intro to the book was grand!"
3,Good for its size,It good for its size does what it supposed to do battery is okay not as long because its small and EQ is so so I have a Sansa and sound is much better but if you need a small on the go mp3 player this is a good one very small!!
3,ZEN Stone Plus,"I bought this product on the recommendation of a techie friend. It probably would be great if I were 12 instead of 50... I have problems with the small ""one button does all"" programming. It took me several hours to figure out how to get the songs to shuffle. It comes with such abbreviated instructions its obvious that they assume that everyone knows how to use it. You can download a more detailed user manual from the website. But once I finally got it set up, it's great. The sound clarity is great, and it has a setting to make sure you can't turn it up too high. This is my first MP3, so I can't compare it to others. But since its half the price of an iPod Shuffle and 1GB more space, I definitely think its worth the money."
3,can't make playlists,"I had a zen nano, which I loved. It was lost, and I figured this newer model would be even better. Well, it's cute and the sound is fine, but I can't make playlists! I teach fitness and need to be able to put songs in the order I want, but this stone only puts songs alphabetically. Very frustrating for me. It's practically worthless. I'm not crazy about the way you press the buttons to get to the menu, browse songs, etc."
4,Creative Zen Stone Plus,Creative Zen Stone Plus 2 GB MP3 Player (Black)This is a good product worth its price
5,Great,"I bought this along with the Zen TravelSound (which I highly recommend, by the way) and it has been great for use in my car. Works just like it should, tiny, seems durable (I dropped it in a parking lot and have had no problems), lightweight, and easy to use. Great for running/exercising. I like that you can use windows explorer to organize it and add/remove music from it. Side note: If you are going to use with the TravelSound its a little annoying when you want to turn it off or on because you have to unplug the mp3 player from the speaker to press the on/off button."
3,"Nice features, but slow fast-forwarding a headache","I bought this specifically to download library books (they won't work on my iPod). It's a nice little unit with some fun features. I listened to my book on my last long drive and it worked well - I considered it to be worth the money.However, since I got back, I have accidentally lost my place in the book several times, and it gets worse each time. Maybe I'm missing something, but the book is one large file, so I can't find any way to get back to where I was without simply holding the fast-forward button down. It really doesn't go that fast at all, so I literally have to hold it down for more than half an hour to get 8 hours into the book (where I was). Currently it's sitting next to me clamped into an adjustable wrench so that I don't have to physically hold it myself."
1,THIS IS NOT THE DOTTIE I REMEMBER!!,When you grew up listening to Dottie--you remember the way she sang the songs orginially----This just doesn't have the Power or Spirit that I remember Dottie having. The Miner's Song is the Pits!! Could she not pull something out of her Songbook? Sorry--But when I want to listen to Dottie--I'll go back to her earlier works.
3,car hop,"The only problem that I had with this item was the lack of paperwork included with my order. I ordered 2 different sizes and needed to return one of them. The lack of paperwork made it difficult to return. Hopefully,if this problem is dealt with,returns will be easier for customers."
4,The Ice Storm: Good or Bad?,"Though it starts out somewhat slow, Rick Moody's novel The Ice Storm provides some excellent insights as to how life was for middle class families in the 1970s. Much of the novel actually takes place in the characters minds, through their thoughts which I personally think is a great way to tell a story. There are very vivid descriptions, the characters are easy to ""attach oneself to,"" and the novel is filled with many different emotions. Overall, I can definately see why this book has become a National Bestseller and I would reccomend it to others. In fact, I enjoyed it so much, I plan to read ""Purple America"" and ""the Garden State"", Moody's other two novels, next."
3,Too Much Information,"It's a rare thing, but I liked the film better. Plus, my view of the book may have been colored by the film, which I saw before I read the book. We are given all this info what wasn't in the film that lead me to almost dislike the characters, I could not identify with them as well in the book. Yes, they had more demension, but less mystery, things were more on the surface in book, all the reasons, every wart and sore (literally in Ben's case) was there to see.But for any problems I had with the characters I still liked the story and Moody's style is fantasic. He's smart and is able to go off on tangents, then brings you back to the main subject with better insight to what is going on.The book is well worth the read, the Film is definitely worth a viewing."
4,Good Times,"I originally bought this book cuz I saw my favorite writer had contributed a story, the great HST. Turns out his contribution was a very brief article on his adventure in Africa popping lots of malaria pills (not a lot herb mentioned but still a very funny story.) I really loved all the stories in this book too. Sure, it's a pot book so all it has are stories about marijuana and drugs and stoners. I say so what! It's an excellent collection of different stories about a ""somewhat misunderstood"" subculture and lifestyle. AND THEY'RE FUNNY! These stories are extremely diverse and not all of them are pro-marijuana so there are some different angles presented for the non-tokers. OK, some of the stories do read like one of those typical stoner movies but many had a story to tell and a lesson to be learned. And if the story WAS about a typical stoner situation it was still funny and enjoyable to read. Excellent job Krassner!"
4,OK: CAMELOT,"Camelot is an ""OK"" musical. I like the kind that make me want to get up and dance, or the kind that are VERY dramatic. The music is good, but the singers don't act very well. I can't tell what they are feeling. Julie Andrews {Guenevere} does an excellent job (she always does). Richard Burton {Arthur} could portray his part a little better. My favorite songs: Overture, I Wonder What ... Tonight, C'est Moi, The Lusty ... May, Camelot and What Do The Simple Folk Do. If You like Brigadoon or My Fair Lady, GET THIS CD !"
1,Disc 1 great the rest horrible,The 1st disc was amazing and i actually was starting to learn. It gave me confidence and was fun until I reached the 2nd disc. All of a sudden the whole format changed and was so fast I couldn't understand. It ultimately made me unconfident and depressed. Wish there was something like the 1st disc
5,"Easy to read and understand, got results","I did not feel I had a weight problem. I felt I had 10 pounds to lose. Arnot opened my eyes to what my body is doing with the food I put in it. I ate and exercised as the book said, and the weight fell off. I went from 192 to 169 within 2 1/2 months."
2,Tables hard to consolidate; exercises not for the unfit,"The tables seemed to contradict each other. It would have been helpful to see one (maybe fold out) table with all the categories and how the different foods ranked.He ""disses"" walking and the stationary bicycle which are about the only exercises I can do consistently. The exercise recommendations are not for the person who needs to get fit.It doesn't matter to me that he gained weight to lose it on this program as he obviously already had a high level of fitness and a system to lose excess weight, i.e. very high intensity exercise.When I followed the diet strictly, I had terrible heartburn.Overall, though easy to read and some good ideas."
4,Mind boggoling,"The first paragraph on page 183 , chapter 16 ""Feedforward Eating"" made me feal exactly like that. I was really overwhelmed but am determined to try becausethe diets I've tried the last 35 years kept me hungry all the time. I put the book down for a couple of weeks then read it again jotting down a plan as I went along. I couldn't find any information on what to drink just what not to drink. More menu ideas and recipes would be helpful."
2,Dissapointed,I've used Fiskars hand tools and thought this product would work as well. Not the case. The rope mechanism tangles easily in whatever you're cutting and the rope frayed badly on the guide after several cuts. It worked better after I filed the sharp edge.
2,Fiskars Tree Pruner,I purchased a Fiskars replacement head this past April. I used the new replacement head only a few times when the rope started to break apart. The material used is a nylon material and not strong enough for pruning tree branches. My old Fiskars unit came with a rope that was made of a strong material simular to a clothline material. Fiskars should replace this cord with a stronger cordFiskars Green Thumb Tree Pruner (93936993) POLE NOT INCLUDED
3,no rinse body wash,"I am a bit dissapointed. In the hospital, they used a ro nrinse body wash that you put in the basin and just washed. No rinsing. Yours is just different. However I had an opportunity to use it when the hot water heater quit."
2,Bottle doesn't seal shut,"I try to avoid writing negative reviews for a product when I can, but in this case I feel like its needed.I got my bottle of No Rinse yesterday in the mail. Coincidentally my hands were dirty from working on my Jeep so I tried it out right away. It worked awesome!Heres my problem though: I purchased this as part of my emergency kit, not to sit around the house. After using it I closed the top of the bottle and noticed it didn't look like it made a great seal. I then turned the bottle over and shook it vigorously and a bunch of drops of the Body Wash fell out. It saddens me to know that even if I used a small ziplock bag to carry this with me I'm going to loose some of it from leaking.I don't recommend buying this particular product unless you plan on keeping it on a shelf in your garage."
5,Coloring Atlas of Horse Anatomy,"An absolute must have for the serious horse student, I use mine regulary .The best money ever spent on a tech. book"
3,"Robocop 3 Sountrack,but limited","this soundtrack is missing quite a few songs from the movie.if your a true fan then get this masterpiece.the songs that are missing is when lewis is chaseing a yellow van,and when the japanese guy bow to robocop track are missing too."
3,Bamboo Blinds,"The bamboo woven roman shades that I purchased are nice, but I did expect the bamboo ""slats"" to be thicker. The windows that I purchased this item for are an odd size; just a little smaller than 60"" wide. I will have to cut the blinds to fit inside the window frame but this is not the manufacturer's fault. I thought I could hang them on the outer edge of the frame but since roman shades do not hang flat, there is too much of a gap. I did find some good tips on-line for cutting these types of blinds. Overall, a decent buy."
5,Trouble With Magic,Book was in great condition. I became hooked on the Magic Series after a friend gave me one of the books to read. Purchased the entire series and plan to read again in the future.
5,Brush up your Shakespeare--this recording is too darn hot!,"Cole Porter's finest musical made a great recording, one that every musical theatre fan should own. Kiss Me, Kate featured Alfred Drake (in what I consider his best role), Patricia Morison (with a heartwarming, operetta-like twinge in her voice), Lisa Kirk, and Harold Lang in a wonderfully comic twist on Shakespeare's The Taming of the Shrew. Full of classic songs (such as ""So In Love"" and ""Brush Up Your Shakespeare"") that mix 1940s musical know-how with lyrics that evoke, comment upon, and often even include Shakespeare. Add in the great performances and Kiss Me, Kate is quite simply a must."
4,Necessary addition - much cheaper elsewhere!!,"Just a quick note to those of you who are considering purchasing this accessory: the EXACT same mat (materials, dimensions, etc.) minus the nice red ""Bowflex"" insignia is available from a number of different people on the most well-known, four-lettered auction website. They are asking for less than half of the current price and several of them include shipping in the price. You can search for them with ""Bowflex Mat""Good luck."
3,bowflex mat,"the mat works well to keep the machine from damaging the floor, but it does stay completeley flat on the carpet due to the weight distribution of the machine. the mat buckles up in a few place which is really annoying to me."
2,A little overpriced,"Obviously, no plant that one buys as a decoration for an aquarium is going to look ""real"", but for the price, I feel that these were exceptionally low quality. They look very waxy, and are easily knocked out from underneath the river stones holding them down. I bought several Tetra products when I first got my turtle, and my opinion is that they're more ""starter"" items than well-made, durable items. Maybe they would work very well for fish, but if you're shopping for an aquarium for an aquatic turtle, I would choose better brands because they just aren't up to the job."
1,Never again,"I will never buy another hard drive based mp3 player as long as I live. If you can get this piece of crap to play without freezing--and trust me, you can't--the internal battery will suddenly give out and not hold a charge any more.I am writing this listening to my original mp3 player---a one gig Creative MuVo TX that plugs right into the USB port--and, despite my cost in AA batteries, I am MUCH happier.The Zen Touch just has too many problems, especially with the freezing. The reset button does not even work unless you call support and they tell you the ""secret"" reset that involves holding down the play/pause button as you hit the reset and then running a disk scan and finally rebooting. And the much-praised battery does nothing if it can't hold a charge.Don't waste your time or money on this product."
4,Except for the earphones the player is just EXCELLENT...liked it a lot,This player would have been a killer for its competitors if it had a good earphones along with. The earphone size is too big and ear starts getting pain after sometime. Also the earphone is not that great a quality.The player alone deserves 5 stars for its price.
1,DO NOT READ!,Despite the other reviews that give this book a good rating I have to give it one star and if I could it would get a negative star rating. This book is nothing but a wolf in sheep's clothing. This book is littered with liberation theology which as any faithful Catholic would know is for the most part not inline with Catholic teaching and has been sternly addressed by the Congregation of the Doctrine of Faith. As a philosopher and theologian it is easy for me to recognize what is in accord with Church teaching and what is not and for the most part this book is not. I warn anyone who is considering reading this book to look for another book that is more in line with the Churches teaching on faith and culture.
5,awesome,Bob Marley and the Wailers live is powerful stuff!! I highly recommend this live album to any Bob Marley lover!
1,"Dumb,dumb,dumb movie,forget about it","Stupid idiotic movie it's a wonder that Ron Howard,Beau Bridges,and Johnny Crawfords careers weren't ruined by this movie.Ron was better as Opie Johnny better as Mark and Beau better in The Incident just my opinion.Dancing over-sized ducks shaking their tail feathers,you've got to be kidding?This has a silent menu good quality sound and video but that's about it.Movie theme has good drums and guitars in it but this movie is way outdated by today's Standards for 2010.Wrong roles for Ron,Beau,and Johnny,did not like it at all a total waste of my money."
1,Village of IDIOT Giants,"How on earth did Ron Howard get in this movie? The plot is silly, the writing and the acting stinks, and the special effects are rotten. Come think of it, how did Beau Bridges get in this movie? Both have done far better work. This movie is only watchable if you do NOT take it seriously, which unfortunately, the people making the movie did. Better yet, watch the Mystery Science Theater 3000 version if you can find it. Now there was some great writing and plenty of laughs."
1,not camp-just bad!,sometimes a bad movie can of course be accidentally funny. Reefer Madness comes to mind. This is just terrible. Nothing entertaining about it. Avoid at all costs!!
1,Does not work with Ipad 2,This item does not work. I was unable to use it with my Ipad 2 and did not find out until my 8 hour flight. Very disappointed.
1,Electronic Junk,"Well, stung a second time on Belkin products--shame on me! I open the package, plug 'er in, and the left channel sorta works, sometimes, if you wiggle it around a little and don't move when you get both channels. Should have paid a little more.Before this, a $80 power converter (12VDC to 120VAC) that crapped out after a month of extremely light usage. No more Belkin for me!"
5,Simple but awesome,"Have you been with your IPod, or mp3 player, experiencing great music or maybe watching a movie and someone appears and ask you what is that your enjoying so much, and although you want to earbud that someone you can't because there is only a pair of headphone and you don't want to miss it? Well that problem is solved with this simple gadget. You just connect two headphones and you and that someone can experience the same thing simultaneously. It is really inexpensive and it does not harm the quality of the music or whatever is it your using your mp3 player for. So it is highly recommended..."
1,details?,"It wasn't explained that the headphone splitter would only work with a certain kind of small headphones. Unless one has headphones with a tiny jack, then they are useless."
5,Really convenient to have,I ordered this for our kids so that they can share a Mp3 player in the car or for when they listen to music on the computer. It works great.
1,Did not work out of the box,"I took this on vacation so that my wife and I could watch movies together on our computer. It didn't work so I had to buy the $30 version in the airport (a Boosteroo brand, which incidentally works very well). Do not buy this product."
1,Didnt get what I thought,Almost like false advertising. I like others recieved a different item than what was shown in picture.From now on will read reviews better.
3,It's Just Ok...,It didn't really work like how I wanted it too.For example when I plugged in two headphones they would receive only half the volume.
5,Better Than 20 Years Ago,"I read and lost the first publication of this neat little book, so my only legal option was to buy another copy. However, this one has many improvements. The large type I got used to real fast and it did make the delightful text easier to read. The ""rest of the story"" updates only made the book better. Since nearly all of the ""chapters"" are not longer than three pages the book is easy to read either at one setting or just whenever you have a little time. And while many of the stories are entertainingly funny, others are poignant and gives one some cause for pause from a hectic life to think about the subtile real values which often go unnoticed."
2,Why all the hype?,"I was alerted to this book in graduate school. Having a vague memory of it, I ordered a big print copy which arrived clean but with yellowy pages. Why all the hype? It's ok but sometimes I think it got a lot of fame because a distinguished male wrote it. Really, you can find better books!"
5,I actually use it,"I love this machine because the time flies when I use it and it's quiet so I don't have to blast the t.v. I've had a treadmill for years but I couldn't use it for more than 20 minutes or so at a time because it would hurt my feet. After only three weeks on the elliptical, I'm up to 45 minutes a day without getting sore or joint pain. I actually look forward to using it which is very unusual for me.I can't really compare to other elliptical trainers because I haven't tried them but this one seems sturdy enough and it didn't take long to put together."
5,Well worth the money,"This machine was easy to setup, came when expected and now it is getting used quite a bit by both my wife and I. I like the chest heart rate monitor, since I don't have to hold the heart rate handles to get a reading.When having babies, specially, seems like it saves a lot of time working out when you have very little time to do anything else!!"
1,terrible construction,"This machine has given me problems since day one. Rattles, grinds, twice it has broken down completely. Schwinn is finally going to replace it with a 431 because they no longer offer parts and service on it. They have discontinued it...maybe they recognize that this was a poor design. I hope to have better luck with the 431."
5,smooth ride,"Of all the home-based elliptical trainers, this is the smoothest 'ride'. It's one of the priciest in-home ellipticals, but definitely worth it. We ordered on-line through Amazon--free shipping and no tax. Came promptly to our door and we assembled it fairly easily."
3,Buy the individual albums,"I love Castro, and the songs on this collection are excellent, but do yourself a favor and buy Tommy's individual albums. Something about the sequence of this CD is not good. Maybe it's fine as an introduction to Castro but the individual albums capture the moment much better. That said, Castro is one of the finest blues musicians today and he should be heard by all!"
4,OUTSTANDING SOUND!,"THIS IS ONE OF THREE TOMMY CASTRO ALBUMS I RECENTLY BOUGHT. HIS MUSIC IS FUN, FUNKY,AND RHYTHMIC, MIXED WITH JUST THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF BLUES. I HOPE TO SEE HIM LIVE SOMEDAY."
5,Theses dye's rock,I can always count on these dye's being great quality and making the best bright colors. Wish I could buy them locally.
2,too oily for my preference,"My skin is normal to oily and I found this cleanser way too oily for my preference. My face does not feel clean after using this product. I was told that the lemon oil in this cleanser is antiseptic and good for blemishes and that it helps reduce oil in the skin. Perhaps this is true, but in the meantime I am not patient enough to wait for that to happen while my face remains feeling greasy. The lemon does smell lovely though! I wish I liked it more for that reason alone."
3,good price but watch out for rust,"The pit was a gift for my husband, we have used it a ton, but the cover it comes with is not waterproof- as a result the grate inside the pit rusted. Overall we are happy with this product."
5,A good collection of stories,"I liked this book- I enjoy short stories, and these were entertaining and engaging. Lori Wick's books are a great escape for me, and I've read them all, eagerly awaiting her next one."
3,not a favorite,"I like Lori Wick and I liked many if not all of these stories, but the paragraphs at the end of each explaining where the idea for it had come rubbed me the wrong way. The writing was not at fault, but that extraneous paragraph was a design flaw."
4,"Twists, turns, betrayal and a little romance","Into the Path of Gods takes place in fifth-century Wales. This Arthurian legend is about the events leading up to Arthur's ascent to the throne of Britain. The book focuses on Claerwen, a young woman who, at first, seems like any other ordinary woman, except she has ""fire sight."" She is ruthlessly pursued for years by power-seeking men looking for a treasure they are sure she has; only she doesn't have a clue what they are after. During this time she meets and falls in love with a spy. Their story is not your typical romance story; this story is full of twists and turns, betrayals, loyalties, and intrigue. It is well worth reading.I thoroughly enjoyed this book and I'm looking forward to reading the rest of the series."
4,Good solid excercise bike,Bike was delivered promptly. Not too difficult to assemble. Bike made popping sound at increased peddling speeds. I was afraid it was defective but discovered that one of the fan blades was not attached (clipped) to a spoke like the other blades were. This was allowing the blade to move and hit the chain and cause the noise. We were able to push the blade to clip onto the spoke and problem was solved. Otherwise the fit and finish seems good. This is a great excercise machine. My only complaint is that the seat is a little uncomfortable to me after 30 minutes of peddling.
2,Overrated,Sturdy bike. Couldn't get the monitor to stay put. What good is a bike if the seat busts your butt so bad you can't stay on it for more than 20 minutes. I wonder if the recumbent bikes are any better. I need exercise but this bike discourages it.
4,Schwinn Airdyne,"This is a pretty solid machine, I have used them before in a local health club. I think it is worth the money, I like the new color vs white and it is super easy to assemble. Issues: it came in a box that needed to be sturdier, mashed up, but not damaged. It has a little click during operation, that seems to come and go and the rubber skuff pad adhesive is not satisfactory, but also, not necessary and I wouldn't bother with them. It is a good work out for me becatuse I am missing one leg. It is probably the best one out there if you want to get your arms into the action. CWB -"
4,Porr asssembly directions,"Schwinn AirdyneAlthough the product itself is excellent--the assembly directions are INADEQUATE. The lever arms for upper arm exercise must be attached early on but; A)It is never mentioned, B)Although it is not difficult to do, much time was wasted figuring this out. Assembly time was stretched form a possible 1/2 hour to over 2 hours. Pervious reviewers have mentioned this. Is the manufacturer made aware of this or are we wasting time with these reviews?Earl Wm CampbellIs the manufacturer paying any attention to this issue?"
3,"The bike is full of strange noises, rattles a screw has fallen off. It is not as good as my old one.","This bike is O.K. My old bike 10 years old was quiet. This make all kinds of noise. Chain rubs, the left pedal clicks.. The rubber covering over the bike stand won't stay down.It is a great workout and I ride it every day."
4,Great bike,"Exercise wise this is a great bike that will last for years. The ONLY thing wrong with it is the electronic display unit does not align properly with the two bars that come with the bike. There were no screws long enough to even attempt it, so I used duct tape to hold it in place on the bars. It works, but isn't pretty."
5,I use this EVERYDAY,I love thisbuilt like a tanksturdyI put at least 20 minutes a day on itno one issue
2,A bit much in a shoe...,"My 13 year old step-daughter wanted heels for Christmas...I found these on sale, so I bought them for her. What a mistake! The colors are bright and a bit flamboyant for her taste...they looked so cute online, but look so cheap in person. Very clunky. She never wore them and they sit in her closet 2 years later brand new! Waste of money for us."
5,An easy to follow approach to home decorating!!,"I loved this video! The instructors in the video put me at ease and made me feel confident that, ""Hey! I can do that!"" I tried it out with my family room furniture and accessories and it made such a tremendous difference! I couldn't believe that by simply rearranging things I already had my home suddenly looked like I had paid a decorator for advice! I recommend this video to anyone who wants a fresh look but doesn't have the money to run out and buy new furniture!"
3,until the end,"until the end is a good album but nothing can top ""spit"". some of the somes arent that great but some are awesome."
5,A welcome contribution to Civil War and military history shelves.,"Written by Ray Mulesky, Thunder From a Clear Sky is the breathtaking true story of Confederate cavalry officer Adam ""Stovepipe"" Johnson, who led the first Confederate raid across the Mason-Dixon Line to seize the river-port community of Newburgh, Indiana during the American Civil War. Not a shot was fired. A highly accessible true story of how an ordinary man proved capable of a military master stroke, and the fallout thereafter when the territory he claimed was retaken by Union troops. A welcome contribution to Civil War and military history shelves."
3,Good,"I only bought it because I'm the biggest Psychedelic Furs fan and I love this interpretation. As for the rest of the cd... It will grow on me, eventually."
3,Tribute to the power of a plot premise,"Donovan is a successful businessman who dies in an airplane accident and whose brain is rescued by a young scientist ,Cory an assistant to the older scientist Dr Schratt .They keep the brain alive ,which turns out to be an unwise move as it begins to take over and influence the mind of Cory pushing it into ever darker realms of thought and action .The sets are rudimentary with an especially under resourced laboratory being especially unconvincing and the acting , Lew Ayres as Cory apart , is wooden .Yet the picture does evoke a genuine sense of dread and a powerfully miasmic air to it .The movie makes an impact through the power of its central idea and it is worth watching for this alone"
4,A classic Brainer,"Lew Ayres stars in this classic ""disembodied brain"" flick. Though Donovan's body is dead, his brain lives on in a comfy fish tank from which it exerts phenomenal mental powers!Co-star Nancy Davis went on to become First Lady of the United States, selected undoubtedly for her heroic acts against Donovan's malevolent organ.This film inspired many a budding young biologist...or brainologist...to experiment with an old fish tank, a car battery and whatever old brain was laying about. Good clean fun for the entire family."
2,Was good while it lasted,"This was great while it lasted, but I have Fibromyalgia and tight muscles so I need a deep, hard massage and this machine didn't withstand that kind of pressure for too long before it broke. The arms on the roller were made of some kind of plastic and just broke."
2,Just average,"Not bad but I wouldn't recommend it. Doesn't seen to ""fit"" and is not adjustable to the neck size."
2,Very soft,"This cushion is too soft to really provide lumbar ""support."" It may still be comfortable for some people, but do not expect a firm support."
1,Was good for one week-Very disappointed,This was a perfect fit for me. After a week it compressed and was no good any longer.I'm disappointed in this product.
3,Good,"Item and service, both good. I guess your other merchandise will be great too.With thanks and our regardsVirender"
2,Not Bernstein's Candide,"Sorry, but Bernstein had wanted a huge, bombastic show as can be witnessed by his last recording with the then still marvelous Nicolai Gedda as the Governer.Lonny Price's rendition is just a lot of schtick for no good reason but to put the show on at the cheapest cost possible. Indeed, it is a concert but also a bastardization closer to the irrevent debacle that was Harold Prince's version in the 1970's. I cannot believe artists won't return to Lillian Hellman's book. I own a copy and know how this version must have inspired one of the most magnificent scores in Broadway history. It is a shame that this concert will be such a poor reference point for such a crowning achievement."
5,Best Book On Freelancing I've Ever Read,"This is simply one of the best books for starting a freelance art career that I've ever read. This book gives you very practical information about almost every detail of freelance illustration and graphic design. You'll find information on creating business and financial plans, setting up and managing a studio, billing procedures, creating a portfolio and marketing yourself to potential clients. I find a lot of books of this nature don't talk about the raw mechanics of business so much as they offer token inspiration and motivation. If you're interested in a book that will actually give you useful information about the business side of freelancing this is the one to buy.The only areas where it seemed to be a little on the thin side were dealing with taxes and the legal issues concerned with working for youself. Other than that it was wonderful."
4,"More for graphic artists than illustrators, but good inspiration","My interests are much more in illustration rather than graphic design, so I frequently had to scan past a lot of the material that a graphic designer could use. There is a lot of great information here on the real nuts and bolts of running a home business - especially an artistic one - but I think anyone who wants to run thier own business could use a lot of the information and tools in this book to manage their time, money, and goals in an effective way. I have benefitted greatly from the use of this book and would happily recommend it to others."
3,Over Simplified,"This is an OK book. It provides the information a truly naive user would need to set up a commercial VOIP account.This short book is very repetive and chatty. Beyond the historical perspectives, it conatins little useful information that can't be found by looking at a few web sites.Some of the content is pretty, but usless, graphics. I hope you like the picture of the lady on the book's cover, because you get to see it five more times inside the book. Each time it occupies a full page.Even though the book devotes a lot of content to analyzing to cost of various options, it doesn't even mention the fact that you can try VOIP free with a software phone and something like ekiga (the application formerly known as gnomemeeting). Softphone and SIP are found only in the glossary.It is an easy read that will give you rock-bottom basics of setting up your home network and computer for commercial VOIP service."
3,EXTREMELY overpriced!,"I love my Cybersonic, but the replacement brushes are so overpriced that I just might have to give it up. No other brushes fit. Just a sad case of a very greedy company. :("
5,should still be in print,"They are not making this cd anymore but should.Marsalis in concerto mode, surrounded, as usual, by fellow masters. Get it if you can."
5,Madonna deserves it all,"Ev'rything on Madonna is worthy... This tribute comes to show that Madonna was, is and will ever be the main pillar of pop culture."
2,Leg work is not optional!,This product is fine if you can use your legs. There is some upper body but mostly leg work! Not good if you are in a wheelchair and paralyzed like me.
3,Chair Salsa review,Nice alternative excercise for those who have a hard time or barriers to being on their feet to excercise.
3,"Just Desserts: trashy, but worth reading.","Just Desserts reads like fiction. It is almost impossible to believe that one woman could posess all the evil that Martha Stewart is accused of harboring. Despite the obvious exagerrations and questionable sources, Just Desserts is intriguing and will appeal to the busybody in all of us. Details, details, details will have you on the edge of your seat, calling for the exile of Martha Stewart while pitying her family, neighbors, t.v. viewers, and household pets."
1,Very sad,"I find it very sad that Mr Oppenheimer has spent so much time in writing this book, but even sadder that I wasted my time reading it."
5,The Ultimate Stepford Wife-Martha!!!!!,"Ok, first off, let me say that I have nothing wrong with a woman that is independent, hard working and creative.What I do have a problem with is a woman that won't get therapy for her lack of people skills due to her lousy childhood.Look Martha, not all women feel ""inadequate"" becaue they don't spend lots of time on silly compulsive activites such as gathering fall leaves from the backyard and matching them! (when you're rich and have a staff, then you can do these things)Do I feel rage or jealousy becaue I don't do these things? No.Do I realize that Martha would be nobody without her PR machine and spin doctors? Yes.Does she make pretty stuff? Yes,Does she have some serious interpersonal problems? Yes.Good book all around.I do feel sorry for her family.And yes to some reviewers, even men have to contend with this."
1,Awful product!,"This collar is not at all what I expected, obviously, and here's why. First of all, the sound the collar makes to ""distract"" my dog from his barking, is audible to humans as well. It's not even that high pitched of a tone, so it very rarely distracts him. And the collar activates when he's running down stairs or yawning, but not when he's actually barking or growling. This seems to confuse him more than anything. Lastly, the device takes only its own kind of battery and you have to replace it monthly. I highly suggest looking into different products for bark control."
1,This collar doesn't work.,This collar not only doesn't work it doesn't even slow my Rat Terrier's down. I bought the collar as well as extra batteries and It's a total loss. Since I had to shorten the collar it's probably not returnable.
3,Teafco Pet Carrier,"The bag came on time and was in excellent condition, however the dimensions are misleading. I would not consider this a ""large"" bag. It was long but very short. It would be good for a toy breed or a kitten but nothing larger.If I had smaller pets I would have loved this bag, but it did not suit my purposes (two medium sized kittens)."
5,Really Cool Carier,This animal carrier is simply awesome. It is so well made and looks unlike any I have seen before. It is sporty and so cute. I would buy another. I love the orange one!! If you are a traveler and take your furkid along then you need one of these!!
2,Incompatible with HP scanner software,"The camera works reasonably well for its price; however, the software it comes with for recognizing the camera when plugged into your computer via the serial port fails to work properly if your computer has scanner software installed. Polariod tech support identified this as a potential problem when I couldn't get the Izone software to recognize the camera. After uninstalling the (HP) scanner software the Izone software did recognize the camera and downloaded the digital images as advertised.Polariod tech support suggested that reinstalling the HP scanner software after the IZone software was installed would solve the problem. It did not. Anyone with scanner software installed are likely to run into this problem which is not covered in the IZone trouble shooting guide. If you don't have a scanner this might be the gift to get for the child who wants a camera otherwise skip it."
2,Battery drainer,"This camera takes okay pics for the $, but it drains batteries really fast!!... I think I took about 15 pics with brand new batteries and already the batteries were drained."
1,LOUSY Camera,sorry gang but if you have Win 98 DO NOT get this camera it does not work with Win 98 and the packaging doesn't say so. I got it while I still had Win 95 and expected it to still work when I upgraded to 98. Signed a VERY UNHAPPY CAMPER :( don't blame Amazon though since I got it elsewhere but this was a place I could warn others intending to buy it.
5,An amazing work which only Verne can deliver.,"Its an amazing work of Jules Verne. What a description of the flora and fauna of the Amazon. It kindles me to go around hoping the there would not be drastic changes in the hundred and twenty years! I did not realize from the first page that the cryptogram would be so deep in this novel. As usual Verne gave importance to the self esteem and honor of life. A must read for anybody. The first 100 pages may look hard for reading and may look like the description of National Geographic type, but soon when you get into his grips you cannot put it down for a moment."
1,homophobia and other right wing opinions,"I purchased this book because Chapman's Five Love Languages has some very helpful information, however, I found that the Christian undertones of that book become overtly right wing opinions in Parenting Your Adult Child. The focus appears to be on what to do when your child no longer agrees with your morals, particularly if they are gay or co-habitating with someone. Homosexuality is explicitly called wrong in this book. I found this book offensive, and it contains very little by way of helping your adult child ""achieve their full potential."""
2,Art of Appreciation Gift Baskets Some Like It HOT! Spicy Hot Gift Chest,"Perhaps I didn't read the description well enough on this item, but it is a total disappointment. For the price I fully expected it to be in the basket as shown. I didn't expect it to appear in a booby-trap box. As soon as I pulled the 'wrapped' box out of the shipping container, the bottom of it dropped out. There is no basket or even a cardboard tray to contain the items. The 'wrap' on the gift box is designed so the lid will not come off - ever.That being said, I was not very excited about the contents either. I won't buy this item again, nor will I bother with the 'Art of Appreciation' line of gift baskets.This review is for the [...]"
2,Disappointed,"Having first listened to this band with the excellent MECHANIZED WARFARE (2001), I decide to know some of their catalogue, and bought AGE OF MASTERY (1998).This only served to respect and enjoy MECHANIZED WARFARE even more, since I was astonished to realized how tha band matured, evolved ande developed a sound of their own, even being firmly based in classic heavy metal.AGE OF MASTERY is so cliched and juvenile that you'll have to be really patient to listen it entirely. The vocals are ridiculously over the top and annoying (incredible, since they are handled by the same Henry Conklin of Mechanized Warfare). All in all, a generic and medicore effort, although of course the guitar players clearly are very good in their business."
5,Stunning light fixture...excellent customer service!!!!,"This light fixture is absolutely stunning! Quality of glass and fixture is very high quality. Worth every penny! The box is large and well packaged...however the deliver service appeared to have thrown it around a bit..hence one of the glass candles arrived cracked. Upon notifying WOW.. Of this issue,, they immediately responded and followed up assuring me of a quick replacement, Only issue is that I put in 23 ..40 watt bulbs and overloaded my circut! My electrician advised me to replace with 25 watt bulbs...and a dimmer, and this not only fixed the problem...but the lowere wattage made the fixture candles much more beautiful...and with a dimmer, look like actua l candles. Having just bought a new home.. Will definitely be purchasing fixtures from WOW!"
1,Possessed toy!,I never take the time to rate reviews. But this toy really ticks me off. Both my infant (for whom the toy was intended for) and my 2 year get a kick out of this when I take it out of seclusion. But usually I have it locked away since it periodically goes off on its own. There is no way to turn it off and the batteries are too hard to get to pull them out and put them back in all the time. For a while I had it in the downstairs bathroom with the door closed. I could still hear it go off in middle of the night. I don't need that. I put this on my daughter's wish list this past Christmas which is why her aunt bought it. I still kick myself for doing that.There was a lesson to be learned here: never buy a toy without checking how it turns off!
2,This toy is okay,"We bought this for our son when he was about 6 months old. He was too young for it. However, now at 10 months and cruising around, this toy is great for the lights and sounds. But it comes off its rack too easily and my son likes to throw it. I have to supervise him with it, because he can hurt himself or break something if it hits.I wouldn't run to buy this toy. Sorry. I'd look for something else."
1,Horrible,"These headphones came with my sony walkman. when i got them they worked fine, but after about 3 months one ear stopped working. I suggest u pay a little more money and get a good quality product"
5,Feel inspired!,"Truly inspiring book! Was following some ideas from it. Very structured, lots of easy tips how to eat, behaive and live to feel energetic and look better.The book is not about dieting or directly about losing weight, its about healthy style of life which will become first your target and then your habit.Even if you read already a lot about diets, healthy food, and think you know it all (or almost all) this book is a missing push to start not only ""knowing"" but ""applying"" your knowledge into your life. Read it, start your detox and in a very short time you will see new healthier you in the mirror.I am planning to re-read the book from time to time and share with friends."
4,"A good way to introduce your ""next generation"" to The Next Generation","I purchased this DVD used to expose my children (6, 7, 9, and 11) to Star Trek: The Next Generation, a series I watched avidly before they were born. We watched the four episodes in four days, and have since started watching the entire series, starting with season one. The four episodes on this DVD are truly some of the best-made. The Best of Both Worlds is my favorite TNG episode.So, I am giving this four stars, but if you have Netflix, you can save your money, as all of the Next Generation seasons have recently been made available for streaming."
1,Book,I have not received my book. It has been over a month and I still don't have it. There is no tracking and I can't get my book
2,Adolph Lobato,"This is a great product, but the people who pull the orders, sometime come out short, as in this order I am short the coupler the screws on the sewer pipe it should look like the picture, the trouble is you can never call customer service and take care of the problemadolph lobato"
4,Clarks Spark Slides,Very comfortable and well made. I bought brewski first and liked them so well I ordered another pair in black a few days later.
3,Oldies but not all goodies!,"I do not care for most of the songs on this CD. I purchased it for only one song. The 12th of Never by The Chi-lites. Ihave been searching for that song for many years, and was elated to find it. Most other songs on this CD is not the same type of music as 12th of Never,so I only really listen to 2 songs on the CD. Great artists like The Chi-lites should not be mixed with Rap music of any kind!"
2,Where are the Loons?,"I bought this CD because I love the sound of loon calls. Unfortunately most of the CD is anything but loons. The first few minutes and the last few minutes are actually loons, but the rest is a bit of a naturalist's journey. Canoeing, fly fishing, campfire with sizzling frypan are all featured. Great sound effects, not so great with the loons."
5,Mutter playing Brahms,"Mutter at her very best. she plays with such passion and expression, and Orkis is just as good. Mutter is, in my opinion, the very best Violinist in the world today, at least of the living ones that I have heard. I have played since I was six. Never in Her league. But still, I know the instrument and the music. Of violinists that I have listened to, only Fritz Kreisler, surpasses Anne-Sophie's playing. I also truly enjoy the DVD format. I doubt very seriously that I will ever have the oppertunity to see Anne-Sophie Mutter play live. And certainly not in the settings of her DVD performances. So it is a special treat. WNL"
4,"sounds good, looks good but...","This is basically a very nice dvd - high level musicians playing some of the greatest violin music ever, in good sound and well-filmed. My only complaint is that the producers have recorded the sound so we hear it from a far away vantage point, while seeing the concert from a front row seat. Having attended many small concerts like like before, it strikes me as an unnatural effect, and is somewhat disconcerting."
2,Waste of time,"I bought these CD's about a year back and was completely unimpressed. Although it may cover a lot of material, the lessons are difficult and boring to follow. I'd highly recommend Pimsleur's Eastern Arabic - it provides good, everyday phrases you'll need, and can truly have you speaking like a native if you practice enough."
4,You Do Not Want to Swim in This Pool...,"Mary Elizabeth Rafferty a sixteen-year-old girl just got a new summer job at the Ridley Hotel health club, which is the super beatiful hotel. One day she was closing the hotel and a hand had grabbed her leg. What was it? And why was it bothering her? From then on everything in the hotel was weird. People were stealing things, people were disappearing, and someone was murdered in the pool. Read this awesome book and find out what happens. If you had a couple of dollars to spend on one book this would be the one. Why? Well, this a book that will be so good that once you start reading it you don't want to put it down."
1,weeds,"Review what? You sent it to the wrong address and I had to cancel because the intended recipient was no longer a guest at the hotel by the time you got it straightened out. First order, probably last."
4,Great Thrash Band,This is one of the better thrash bands to listen to for a good time in a mosh pit. Best description would be a cross between Motorhead and Suicidal Tendencies. Good lyrics and instrumental arrangements. Great lead guitars. The lead singer is really the main draw back but nothing to gripe about: certainly better than most other sub-par bands out there pretending to play thrash. This is a good album to find out more about the band as you have all of their best stuff and it's worth hearing.
1,Save your money.,"I saw this product on a TV commercial & thought it would be great for my 6-month-old son. Unfortunately, looks can be deceiving. He is too big to enjoy stage 1, but even if he were 1-month-old, I doubt he could fit under the toy as advertised. There is no room due to the product design. There is also no way to trigger the music for ANY of the stages unless you send balls down the shoot or spin the Elmo dial. We setup the stage 2 ""Activity Table"", and there is nothing for my son to do other than spin a dial. He cannot send balls through the shoot as advertised, because the design prevents while in stage 2. There are attachment toys on the legs of this product, which my son can pull off with very little effort. We're hoping stage 3 shows some promise as he gets older, but right now we're VERY disappointed in our first Fisher Price toy"
2,Not the best purchase,"Bought this toy so my son could learn to walk behind it. He couldn't push it on carpet. He did, however, pull up and stand with it. The sounds and lights kept him occupied for a while but now the toys sits in the corner collecting dust."
2,Not really a good buy. (Honest Feedback),"Not really impressed for little ones. I agree my son couldn't fit under the thing. It is a waste until your baby can reach or kick the hanging elmo. My son likes the music. They grow quick and master the ball thing pretty quick...I think he has more fun pitching the balls around the house :) than with the toy itself. They had a great one in his day care, where 2 month olds can interact with foot pedals that move overhead objects while lying on their backs. (Great for head start.) Enjoy parenthood!"
2,Great if you want your toddler to bust his face!,"As everyone else has said, don't waste your money OR the valuable space in your home. Not only is this toy of very little value for an infant, it's downright dangerous for a child learning to walk. More than once, I just barely saved my son from busting his precious little teeth out as this thing began tipping over while he tried to walk with it. (...)"
1,A walker that doesn't roll?,My son couldn't push this walker. The center of gravity is so off he kept falling head over heels.
2,Not Worth the Price,"This toy was received as a gift for my then 7 month old son. From the beginning I could tell that it was not worth the amount of money spent on it. It is difficult to use as a walker, especially on carpet. The only enjoyable thing on this toy is the fact that my now 12 month old son is able to put the balls in the hole and he enjoys the music. I would not recommend this toy for the price it is advertised for"
1,This toy should be recalled!!!,"This toy is so dangerous! Whenever my little girl tries to push it, it tips forward and she tumbles over it (that only happened a couple times before I threw it away!). The design is horrible and it is not sturdy enough to be used as a walker. It's too top-heavy! I cannot believe this toy is still being sold. Do not buy it!!!!!!"
5,portable Rodney Yee,"lovely b&w photos, essential instructions, a good selection of poses -- not quite as nice as a Rodney Yee video, but if you have done some of these, it's a perfect portable version."
1,Returned - Toxic Smell,"I was eagerly awaiting the arrival of these yoga pose cards, with plans to pull the appropriate ones to match my planned evening practices. Upon removing the shrink wrap from the pack, my senses were attacked with a severe toxic odor, making it necessary to immediately remove the cards from my apartment. It was as if someone had opened a gas valve in my apartment. I am troubled to think that a product that focuses on such a healthy activity arrived in such a polluted state. What would Rodney Yee do if he knew about this packaging problem? I placed them in a ziploc baggie and returned them to Amazon. (Please note that I do NOT have MCS.)"
5,Simply wonderful!!!,"I love Crossing Muddy Waters.....it's certainly different than his last, Little Head, which I thought was great. Hiatt is in great voice and it shows, I can almost see the twinkle in his eye as he's singing ""Lincoln Town"", a real toe-tapper. The title cut is simple and lovely. I also like ""Gone"" and ""God's Golden Eyes"" a lot too. I've only listened to this cd twice since I received it yesterday and I have a feeling it will become one of my favorites. John Hiatt is just incredible to me, he can record something in three days that some artists spend their whole career trying to achieve."
5,Courage,"John Hiatt's title song is the bravest work of art I've ever experienced. He uses the title as a metaphor for his first wife's suicide: she's crossed the waters, leaving him and an infant daughter to struggle alone on the other side.At night when the wind blows he hears her moans of remorse in the trees. But the waters have widened and there's no crossing back.Hiatt's simple arrangement makes the song even more evocative by providing a haunting melody that doesn't drown his words in molasses.It took amazing courage for Hiatt to express this achingly sad experience in song and share it with the world. ""Crossing Muddy Waters'' also highlights his artistry: in less talented hands the song would sound mawkish, i.e., Nashville mainstream.That Hiatt, a recovering alcoholic, has lived on some of life's highest peaks and in its deepest valleys makes his music so much more meaningful than the canned crap rolling out of the Acme Music Factory that Nashville has become."
5,Maybe a few weak spots but overall a great album,This album has a number of clear highlights that bring out Hiatt's emotive chops. Check the title song and God's golden Eye's; both will have you singing along but also taking through the feelings that he is putting into it.An artist that may be a bit of an acquired taste but overall is well worth listening to and which deserved a lot more recognition.
1,turn it off,This toy is really loud and there is no way to shut it off. It keeps going off by itself in the toy bin.
1,CMT BIT CLEANER,This stuff just doesn't work. I used it on my table saw blades and router bits and after repeatedly soaking and scrubbing ; it still could not clean them. I DON'T RECOMMEND.
4,Makeup Artists need this book,"This is a great book for makeup artists, probably not great for the makeup junkie consumer. I learned more in this book then I have in all of the makeup classes I have taken over the years. It is a study book more then a read for fun book, every artist needs to read it."
5,"Great Parts, Good Price",Moog simply makes the highest quality front end parts around. The prices I found here on Amazon are the best I was able to find for these top of the line components.
3,Jurassic Park 3,"Don Davis's score for the third instalment of the Jurassic trilogy is a fun, if sometimes unoriginal soundtrack.Davis, who did the music for The Matrix, plays all the familiar notes of John William's work on the first Jurassic, and while it's well done, it's too reliant on the well-known theme tunes of the first one. That said, there is some great stuff here, with ""Bone Man Ben"" and ""Nash Calling"" being the highlights. With some tracks reminiscent of the scores for Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981) and Hook (1991), it does flow smoothly through all the different tunes until Randy Newman's jarringly awful song ""Big Hat, No Cattle"". A good, if not great soundtrack."
4,How To Host a Murder-Grapes of Frath-game review,"This game is very funny and exciting. Every character has something secret to tell, most of which are usually hilarious! Be prepared: Not everyone is who you expect *wink wink*."
4,"Great quality, easy setup",I am very pleased with my purchase of these dining chairs. They are of excellent quality at a great price and everyone who I've told about them is interested in buying. I bought a total of 6 chairs for my dining room and they were very easy to setup. Takes about 10 minutes per chair with tools included in the packet. I recommend adding some wood glue to the joints for stability.
5,Perfect,"These chairs are perfect for apartment life, they are very light, easy to clean, and are the perfect size. I bought 4 and I love them."
5,Must have book for every woodworker's library,"I have read many books on woodworking, The Complete Woodworker's Companion is the only reference book I own. Roger Holmes has written a very concise and relevant book on the fundamentals of woodworking; including tools, wood preparation, construction methods, and finishing. The galleries of modern masterpieces are just as interesting and educational as the chapters on woodworking. Every beginning and intermediate woodworker should read this book cover to cover and then read it again."
2,Great concept,But we had to fix stuck coins 5 times in the first night alone. Within a week we have now hid this toy on top of the fridge because my 18 mos. and 3.5 yo kept getting so frustrated.
3,Coins get stuck,"While all the other aspects of this toy are great - lifelike coins, numbers, sounds the fact that the coins get stuck constantly really detracts from its value. Every time my children play with this toy the coins get stuck. Since this happens almost immediately they have not spent more than 2 minutes with it since they got it. It's too bad because if this did not happen I think the toy would get a lot of use and my children would learn alot too. If I could I would return this toy to the manufacturer."
2,Not a great toy,"My 3.5 year old received this cash register for Christmas and I thought it would be great. We opened it and within 5 minutes of playing, the money got jammed inside and we couldn't get it out. After being on the phone with Leap Frog for about 30 minutes they said just have a screwdriver handy because this happens regularly. Not so good and very frustrating for my son. Also, you can't use it to play ""store"" with - it only allows you the programmed way to play, you can't total up your own stuff without prompts, songs, etc. I'd prefer the basic old cash register. I sold this one at a yard sale."
5,"smart toy, for any age","My daughter received the cash register for Christmas when she was only 1 1/2. She is now 3 1/2 and is still playing with it. My husband wanted to get her just a plain old register, but I wanted something more educational for her, that can grow with her too. Not only does she still play with it, but it goes great with the food and grocery cart. It is a toy that is never rotated out. A lot of reviews listed the coins keep getting stuck, but failed to mention that Leapfrog put a little door to release the coins. Most toy registers have the coins get stuck, not just Leapfrog. It seems unfair to criticize a brilliant toys for this one feature. It has taught my daughter how to count, identify numbers and identify the coins. I know she will have more years to come to enjoy this toy. I think Leapfrog products are by far the best toys you can buy for your child."
4,....,"The toy is great and my triplets love putting the money in the register, but the coins keep getting stuck in there and i have a hard time pushing them through..."
1,disappointed,Thank goodness it is Christmas morning and there are plenty of other toys to play with. I bought this to go along with the grocery cart from leapfrog. I thought it would be awesome and I disregarded what others had said about it getting jammed. Well sure enough by the THIRD coin it got jammed!!! how ridiculous. I wouldn't know how educational it is because it's not working. durability --I will never know because this is going back!
3,Challenger restoration,This is a good reference book to have but you will need an assembly manual to tackle a restoration. The book has very little in the way of practical restoration tips and a lot of rehash of Chrysler data.
3,Card Ok - Quirky Drivers,"ATI is not known for its driver development. The card performs well...but installation was a bear...drivers frequently did not work with other devices (USB USR modem for one) I have since upgraded to the 64meg, dual processor, rage and have found that to be a bit better. Dont know if I will buy an ATI card again though"
1,this toy is weak!,"This toy was a huge waste of money. The truck mode it very nice and does look the part of Optimus Prime being this tough tractor trailer but that's where it ends. The robot mode is awful and being that you have to disassemble it to transform it takes away from it being a ""transformer"". If you can look past that you still have this extremely fragile robot that doesn't like to stand under his own power. I'm an adult collector but between 2 grown adults we still had trouble with the directions which took away from the fun aspect of building it."
5,Un pasaje a la intimidad,"Arjona es un contador de historias, un juglar. O por lo menos eso nos había hecho pensar hasta Sin Daños a Terceros. Con este disco se visita a sí mismo, se convierte en testigo de sus relatos. Ya no es el portero o el taxista el que habla, sino el hombre, el músico. No en vano, tras esta producción el escenario de sus conciertos se convirtió en una sala de estar. La evolución desde su otra obra maestra ""Historias"", es notable. Con temas como ""Desnuda"", ""Mentiroso"" y ""Tarde (sin daños a terceros)"" Ricardo Arjona logra complementar la ternura, el amor y la desesperanza todo junto en letras sensibles e inteligentes."
5,"They all look fine to me, but no more box sets PLEASE!!","All three films look great to me on the PS3. Now I'll just have to wait for the individual release of ST 6. I'm so sick of all these ""collections"", please release the movies individually. I'd never buy a set with ST 1&5 in it."
2,Star Trek: Motion Picture Trilogy [Blu-ray],Nice the have all three not nice Paramount doesn't give you the option of the directors cut. GIVE THE FANS OPTIONS!!!! I know some fans out there love the Theatrical Release.BUT the one time i actually want a directors cut and they don't release it.Ill be give this to a friend i have the DVD version WITH BOTH OPTIONS!!! Maybe Paramount should talk George Lucas in bringing out his theatrical Versions.... Not gonna happen (Glad i got Used worth every penny)
1,Who in the world decided...,"This is the most bizarre way to release movie franchises... ""Star Trek: The Motion Picture Trilogy"" does not even include ""Star Trek: The Motion Picture."" If you do want it, you'll have to buy ""Star Trek: Original Motion Picture Collection,"" which, according to the info on Amazon, doesn't even include Robert Wise's Director's Cut of ""ST: TMP."" (As everyone knows, the ""theatrical version"" of ""ST: TMP"" wasn't even finished when it showed. Who knows what weirdo actually wants to pay -- PAY! -- to see that incomplete film.)The truth is that Paramount and other studios discovered from their DVD releases that people really will buy their products twice, sometimes three or four times, all they have to do is release the inadequate version first. They are not getting me this time, I've learned my lesson.Paramount, let me know when the cake is ready."
3,What's the point?,"What's the point of this set?Get the box that has movies 1-6, or better yet, wait until movies 1-10 are all available in a single Blu-Ray box.Only getting movies 2-4 is lame, especially when you're not even getting the Director's Cut of Wrath of Khan."
1,awful picture and sound,"after watching the first 5 minutes on my Pioneer 111fd using a Pioneer 51 fd blu ray player , my stomach began churning.How could they call Star Trek II a remastered film.There is bar along the left side of screen, picture is dark, dirty and soft.Who is Paramount kidding here.I have not watched III and IV yet, but I'm afraid to after watching this poor video transfer and a tinny hollow soundtrack on what is their so called remastered masterpiece.rent them if you like e'm then buy it.I should have.I would never have bought this.SAVE YOUR MONEY."
4,A Solid Blu Ray Set At An Excellent Price,"I was prepared to buy this set when it was $32.99, but I snapped it up immediately when it dropped to $29.99. I did hesitate, owing to the poor reviews, but I have to say, I'm very happy with my purchase. Star Trek II alone would have been worth the purchase price, and yes, it does look the best out of the trio, but Star Trek III and IV look very good as well. (I viewed them on a 42 inch LCD screen, by the way.) The latter two films certainly are not the abominable, cut rate transfers some of the reviews would have readers believe they are. Though I plan on eventually buying the first Star Trek movie as well, these three films are my favorite ones with the original cast, and are among my favorite science fiction films of all time, and I couldn't be more pleased to have them on Blu Ray."
4,"'Please Sir, can I have more?' - Oliver Twist","I heard Hough perform the F minor Sonata at the RFH in London this year and it was broadcast later on radio so I recorded it and compared it with his recording. The recorded version is understandably more conservative than his live perfomance but this takes away some of the exuberance of the youthful Brahms. Roaring octaves in the live performance become clean cut, controlled octaves in the recording. If this were any other pianist's recording I would drool over it, yet this is Stephen Hough and I want more. I expect something extra special when anything comes from Hough's Hyperion recording camp. For those seeking the ultimate Brahms Op.5, have a listen to Clifford Curzon's recording on Decca.The Ballades are excellently performed and recorded, and I particularly enjoyed the floating 4th."
1,terrible,"the most significant part of this forgettable book is when the author recounts what was said in a magazine about him: 'as long as there is a village without an idiot, this guy will find a home.' that really says it all, don't waste your time or money on this pitiful book."
5,Mint Condition sends me swingin',With powerful vocals and and excellent instrumentals the members of Mint Condition separate themselves from the ordinary. Pretty Brown Eyes was the first track I heard. But when I got the collection I never got tired of it. A fabulous band with an authentic sound. Being a romantic those songs take me to higher places even if it is alone. I would recommend this album to anyone. I guarantee their addiction to the melodies.
4,its ALL THAT!!!!!!,"mintcondition have it going on. there silky voices coupled with that up-beat jazz flava, is just asking to be played again and again. this album is brilliant and is ideal 4 those of u who arent sure about the group. this album has the lot from start to the present day. OH CHECK OUT THE TUNES BY THE GROUP, ON THE WOO AND WHY DO FOOLS FALL IN LOVE SOUNDTRACKS THEY ARE HOT."
3,Talented Band,"I did enjoy half of the songs on the CD but the other half were ok.Even though this is a band, the lead singer has the potential to venture out on his own. He is a great singer. I always loved they way he sings.I hope Mint Condition will be coming out with another album soon."
1,Snore X,"P4 3.0; 1GB ram; 256MB nvidia graphics card. This configuration is 4 times greater than the minimum requirement for this software.This game is unplayable; even at the lowest possible graphics settings, it's to SLOW.Building scenery takes FOREVER. Rebuilds are SLOW.Also noticed that it uses lots of memory and isn't too good about releasing allocated memory. I had an instance running that started at 200+MB went up to 800+. I closed the app and it never released that memory. Reboot was the only way to get that memory back.Unless Microsoft plans to patch this game ASAP, I would skip it for now. It's not worth the aggravation. Can't really play this game, very disappointed, but it's pretty typical of Microsoft to release crap before it's time."
1,Download the demo first,"When I saw the hype regarding the game, I was interested in buying it as I used version 2004.For those not familiar with Flight Simulator, it is not a game but a simulator as the name implies - and a very good one.Judging by the machine difficulties mentioned here, I felt I should download the demo first and see if my Asus nVidia chipset, AMD 64 X2 4800+ CPU with 2GB of RAM can handle the game. My video card is the nVidia GeForce 7800GTX.When the game started, it defaulted to low res mode. In this mode, it looked no better than the previous version. When I changed the res modes to high (ultra high is the top res mode), it was playable, but the frame rate sucked - I would guess maybe 10 frames a second (or less). In ultra high res, it was worse. It felt as if I was watching a series of images.Seems this game has the ability to humble many of the 'newer' machines out there.My recommendation is to download the demo before buying just to see if you can handle the low frame rates."
1,Micro$oft Death Spiral,"I have 3 systems a Dell 3.2GHz P4 w/ 2GB RAM, A Dell E510 PD 2.8 w/2 GB RAMAnd a self built Core2 Duo E6600 w/2GB RAM. The P4 is using an ATI x600 and the PD and Core2 Duo are using an ATI x1900 Video Card.I have no problems running other games or anything else for that matter. I cannot get FSX to run on any of these systems properly. I haven't yet figured out what is wrong with FSX (I'm a computer professional)but I am seriously considering returning. Not ready to fly. Major disapointment.Er...can't you just wait for Vista????"
3,FUN GAME BUT HAS SOME PROBLEMS,"This game is very fun but there are some serious problems that hinder it's performance. There are many types of aircraft and different places to fly. There are even about twenty-five missions that you can beat. The detail that they were trying to accomplish is great in this game but even the best pc's don't have the power to run this program with the settings on high without lag. We have 4 gigs of memory and it eats that up and asks for more. In a couple years they will be probably be making PC's that can run this flawlessly but not at the present time. These are the requirements for you PC to run this program.Microsoft Windows XP SP2 / VistaPC with 1 GHz equivalent or higher processor256 MB of system RAM for Windows XP SP2 / 512 MB Vista14 GB available hard disk spaceDVD-ROM drive32 MB DirectX 9 compatible video card requiredSound card, speakers or headphones required for audioMicrosoft Mouse or compatible pointing device56.6 Kbps or better modem for online play"
1,Microsoft is very misleading... Unless you have a blazing fast powerful system save your money,"Although the interior cockpits of this game have been greatly improved to look and perform much like the real thing, this game is a complete waste of money unless you have a PC with at least 3.5 Ghz and around 3 GB of RAM. I was completely disappointed after paying $50 for the deluxe edition and finding out that the graphical quality didn't even work with the system specs written on the box. I will never buy another one of Microsofts products again. However as negative as this review might sound, for those that have an awesome state of the art system, this game can't be beat. There is a lot more eye candy apparently than the 2004 version and if you get the deluxe edition you can even play online as an ATC controller or use a headset as a virtual pilot so it's not all bad. If you have a pre-2007 system I recommend FS 2004 but if you will be buying a new computer soon I'd get MSFS X."
2,Need a supercomputer to run this,"The software is very good. But the problem is that it doesn't run smoothly even in a computer that has good specifications. I recently got a computer which has a 2 Ghz dual core processor, 2 GB Ram, a Video Card, Windows Vista and what not. But flying hasn't been fun because of the slow frame rates. I will be sticking to FS2004 and LEVEL D SIM for quite some time."
1,Stay with FS2004,"In many respects this sim is inferior to FS2004. The frame rates are terrible and the aircraft viewpoints too fussy to get to quickly. Anyone with FS2004 and with good add on scenery I would advise to stay with it. My computer is state of the art with dual core PCU, Nvidea 7900GT graphics. Over New York in FS2004 with all sliders maxed out I get over 35 fps, with FSX I get 7 fps.with sliders at normal and a slide show. I have since uninstalled my FSX and returned to FS2004."
1,Games should be returnable,"Background about myself, I am a Private Pilot, and Computer Programmer. My basis for this review is that this sim is a slideshow on my computer. I have an Average setup, like most people would have, here is the background on that. I have an Athlon 64 3200+, a GeForce 7600 GS 512MB, and 2GB of RAM. It will only run smoothly in low quality everything. In low quality, it actually looks worse than FS2004 did. Essentially, I can't land a plane anywhere in this sim, because as soon as I get close to the ground, it turns into a slideshow. Makes for unimpressive gameplay."
5,Need help deciding if you want to buy or not?,"I bought the game and it works great! It is the funnest thing I ever played, but I do have to agree with some of you guys. It does take a long time to load and the graphics are horrible on most of todays computers. I have a computer that I built myself (2.66GHZ 2GB ram and a 512MB video card) and it works great. I would highly reccomend to not buy this product if you dont't have at least a 1GB of ram and a 512MB graphics card. I AM NOT AN EXPERT, but the game does work great for me. If you do have a good graphics card I would highly reccomend buying this product- It is so much fun!"
1,Fun for 20 minutes and too easy,"it is fun for 20 minutes and then it gets so old. its not way too realistic. graphics are good but is too hard on your system. get x plane 9. it does not have as manny missions, and i recommend you have a little expierence with flight sim and computers. but it is so much better with way more planes."
5,"addicting,just addicting","I remember when I first downloaded the demo version for fsx,just dieing to takeoff from Kenedy. But it did not have that airport, only 3 airports and no tutorials! This is exactly the opposite of my troubles. Here you can basically fly anywhere. The only bad thing is i had to buy a joystick,which I really did not want to buy. you can always download aircrafts onto fsx,but sometimes it's better to stick to the stuff fsx gives you"
3,"Excellent graphics, BUT very slow","Even with a fast chip and 3GB of memory, you cannot choose the high settings, as the game becomes impossible to play, due to the slow speed and very jittery motions. Too bad, it could have been an amazing experience, otherwise. Given the slowness, I actually enjoy FS 2004 more than this one, as this version can be quite frustrating, despite the very detailed and beautiful graphics. I use Windows XP, service pack 3."
4,Best yet,"Takes forever to load, even on a fast machine. Good/Fast gaphics, but you must have a ""HOT"" video card and the more (and faster) RAM the better."
1,Agree overall with other reviewers,"Was excited to pick this up for a while. However, very dissapointed in the fact that with a Pentium 4 2.6 Gig 512 Mb RAM with NVIDIA graphics card and this game is SLOW. Even worse, when all settings are set at low and the game actually runs smoothly, the graphics are the exact same as Flight Sim 2004. I guess I will remain dissapointed until I sink a few grand in a new machine in a few years..."
1,FLIGHT SIMULATOR X,"I am very disappointed with Microsoft - I loaded the Flight Simulator and the programme crashed and told me to re-install it.When I tried, I continuously got an error message concerning msi installer that was present on the ROM.I contacted Microsoft support and they eventually said they would investigate furthur - that was over 10 days ago and I have not heard a thing since.If you can help me with this, I would appreciate it.Arthur Smales"
1,Big Mistake,"I don't normally write reviews for products, but I thought I would help spread the warning about this product. It took 2 hours to install...30 minutes to get the first flight running, and then it took 2 hours to uninstall! My system is NOT an antique either. 2GB of RAM, AMD 2.5 Ghz Processor, 512MB NVIDIA GeForce and I could barely get it to run with the lowest graphics settings (which makes it look like FS98). What a waste of $60. I strongly recommend staying with FS2004. You'll be much better off."
5,good,nice compliation of there best songs venom are the founding fathers of black metal .they rule hail venom.those of you who are the ulitmate metal fan and never heard of or don't have venom this would be a good cd to add to your collection a must be for metallers allover ..
3,"Not bad, not great...","The underwear were pretty comfortable, but they tend to unravel in the washing machine. I really hate handwashing so I wish they were a little more durable."
5,Supporter,"Great fit, very comfortable, where under jeans and keeps the boys incheck. The little wider waist band is better than the swim/run jock. I recommend this, and of course the black is perfect it doesn't show anything as in stains etc. : )"
4,The Forger,"This was a fun movie to watch. It wasn't the kind of forging I expected, had not seen reviews before getting it but I'm a fan of Josh Hutcherson and enjoy seeing him in different characters roles. His character had an exceptional talent which he needed the proper guidance to nurture. Most girls would like this movie."
2,Disappointing,"Story seemed like it was being made up as it went in. Overacting by the Eastwoods did not help. Happily, Hutcherson, Molina, and Bacall were believable in their roles."
2,WATCH SMALL FINGERS,i bought this toy for my 6 1/2 mo daughter and she played with it two times. Both times she got her finger caught in the rolling drum part of the toy. She cried and cried :[ i contacted fisher price to let them be aware of the problem. Just be careful of fingers in the rolling drum. May be a better toy for an older child. The rectangle holes in the drum can allow a finger to get stuck when the drum is rolled with the other hand. Keep in mind my child is only 6 mos but that is the age on the box 6 mos and up. Just a word of caution to small fingers. As a result after 2 days the toy was boxed up and is being returned :[
1,Boring,"As a mom of a 14 month old, I can honestly say this was the worst toy my son has. He got it for his first birthday and he has touched it maybe once. He only stayed interested for about 2 minutes. There isnt really much to the toy but a single song and a few lights. The only thing he likes about the toy is the single blocks. He will stack those and knock them over. Other than that it is boring."
2,Get the PEEK-a-Blocks sets instead,"This wagon is a plain-and-simple ripoff. It is incredibly lacking and not fun, except for the actual PEEK-a-Blocks, which you can separately get sets of. So, I don't recommend it to parents: at least for our son, it wasn't fun or much of an educational product. In fact, we're returning it. Its durability (I mean, after all, it IS a Fisher-Price toy) doesn't make up for its other shortcomings."
1,Watch the fingers!,"My 10 month old son reveived this as a present. He repeatedly got his fingers caught in the spinning wheel and under the teeter totter part of the toy. I thought maybe he was too young for the toy, so I put it away for several months. When I brought it back out, we had the same problem. Every time he plays with it toy, he ends up in tears! It will be donated to charity!I would not recommend this toy!"
2,Annoying music.,"This toy looked interesting, but the music is so annoying (not enough variety) and starts playing at the slightest touch. The individual blocks are interesting and my 8 month old enjoys hitting them together and putting them in the wagon. No pinched fingers like some of the other reviewers. But I turned the music off!"
1,hand injury waiting to happen,"I thought my son(9 months) would love this, and he did. Then he hurt himself. His fingers get caught in the spinning wheel. At first I thought it was a fluke but 2 injuries later out to the trash it went. The trouble is if the babies have one hand on the wagon when spinning the wheel it closes on their little hands. I know Im not the only one with this problem, I wish I had read the reviews first. At least my kids enjoy the blocks. Save yourself some cash and just buy a box of the cute blocks."
1,WAGON OF DOOM!!!,"My little one got peek a blocks for her b-day. She loved them so I decided to get her the wagon.BIG MISTAKE. I gave this toy a poor ""fun"" & ""educational"" rating b/c it can't be much fun or educational if she's crying the whole time b/c she gets her fingers caught in the wheel! I called F/P to complain & they were aware of this already. umm... HOW ABOUT A WARNING STICKER!!The warning would not have deterred me from purchasing it, but at least I would have known there was a possibility and could have watched for it. WAY TO GO FISHER PRICE.....NOT!!!"
1,Boring/Unsafe,"All my baby wants to do with this is eat the stickers off of the blocks. I've tried to report this to Fisher-Price, and they either keep me on hold or hang up on me...My two year old doesn't even play with it!"
4,Great fun!,"This wagon keeps my 9-month-old entertained for a long while! He already learned to open and close the yellow door for music. However, it is easy to get fingers stuck in both the door and the wheel that turns around. Other than that, he likes everything about the wagon and loves all of his peek-a-blocks!"
3,"Okay toy, but got boring too quick.","I was so excited when I first saw this toy advertised, but got shot down once we opened it up for Christmas. My daughter wasn't interested in what was in all the blocks, just the lights that blinked with the music on the wagon. Her interest has never lasted too long with a toy, but she hardly goes back to this one and when she does play with it, she gets the blocks stuck in the wheel and it doesn't move for her anymore. Not recommended, but cute concept. Expected more from FP."
5,grandson loves it,"we bought the wonder wagon for our grandson and gave it to him when he was 5 1/2 months old. it immediately captured his attention and now at nearly 8 months old, its his favorite toy. his eyes light up when he sees the wagon or hears its music. it is easy for the child to play the music and the blocks seem indestructable. its definitely a toy a that will keep his attention as he gets older. the handle slips easily underneath out of the way of play for the younger child. as the child develops and is able to walk, the wonder wagon can be easily pulled along. there certainly weren't toys like this when my kids were young!!"
3,I like it.,I like this toy probably more than my child likes it. My 8 month old will lift the flap to get the music to play but doesn't really have the motor skills yet to do much else with it. The music is a refreshingly different tune. She does like looking at the blocks and chewing on them and carrying them around with her. I assume after she learns to walk she'll pull the wagon around with her so that may add interest for her.
3,Annoying sounds and Pinched Fingers,"My daughter has also pinched her fingers in this toy a couple of times. She does enjoy putting the blocks into it as well as just moving the shelf, doors and wheel on it's own. After a VERY short while, the sounds get to be annoying because it is the same two sound over and over everytime the toy is activated. There is an off button, but the toy is not quite as much fun without the lights. But you can't do the lights without the sound unfortunately."
4,Very interesting and well-made indie film,"With a very engaging and uniquely human story, this film offers a premise that places it somewhere between mystery, sci-fi and drama, yet it doesn't feel stretched in any of those directions. Acting is excellent with very few exceptions, and for the most part it doesn't feel like the small independent film it is. I was particularly moved by the climax involving the main character's little girl. I've seen other films by this director and he is definitely someone to watch. If you can find his short ""Oculus"" anywhere, be sure to check it out."
4,Spookie Ookie is ok,"I bought A Spookie Ookie Halloween for my 4 year old granddaughter and it was perfect. Its not too scary for smaller children to watch. I would recommend it to Grandmas, but especially for when your grandchildren are small."
2,come back Immature!,"I know that they are older now but that shouldn't stop them from talking about love. They are being really perverted on this album. ""First time"" is so stupid. I'm tired of Marques ""Batman"" taking all the spotlight. LDB may not sound like Batman but they should still pass him the mic sometimes. This cd should be called ""On their most perverted behavior"". I give props to them changing their name but they didn't have to change their sound."
1,Keeps coming APART,"Thankfully, this toy doesn't actually pick up (YAY say the cats!) But, the handle CONSTANTLY comes off, and the ""attachment"" won't stay attached. My daughter got this toy for Christmas, but won't play with it because it is continuously coming to pieces."
2,Very Dissappointing!,"My son is not yet two and he loves this toy.. it has one BIG design flaw though.. the handle snaps into place, and it doesn't seem to take much effort for it to break off.. this has happened to us twice.. we emailed Hasbro and they did replace it for free, and we have emailed them yet again and are awaiting a reply.. in the meantime I have a very upset toddler because his favorite toy isn't working."
3,It's Ok,"Don't know what all the fuss is about. It works well, and my daughters (ages 2 and 4) like it well enough, but they're not gaga over it. They would probably enjoy something that looked more like Mommy's, but the only ones I found were rated low for durability and I wasn't willing to take that chance. I rated it low for educational value, but really, who cares? Isn't a toy allowed to just be fun anymore??"
2,Stopped working less than six months after purchase,"My 2 1/2 year old daughter enjoyed pulling out this toy when I would have to vacuum the carpets. It gave her something to do while I was vacuuming without getting in my way or getting scared of the big vacuum. She liked feeling like she was helping me out. However, less than 6 months after purchasing it, Dusty stopped working. Thought it just needed new batteries, but we replaced the batteries and it still doesn't work. This is very disappointing to my daughter. I've emailed Playskool (Hasbro) and am awaiting a response from them. I'm hoping they will replace the toy for free. If so, I hope that one will last longer. Not sure what the ratings are on other toy vacuums, but you may want to check those out before you purchase this toy."
1,broke within two weeks,"This vacuum broke within two weeks. I sent it back at the manufacturer's instruction and was told I'd be receiving a replacement vacuum. Instead, they sent a completely different toy (for a younger age group) and told me they no longer make this vacuum and I have no choice in the replacement item--it would be sent randomly from their warehouse and a worker would choose a replacement and there's nothing I can do about it. So, basically, I paid for this toy to have someone else pick out a different toy for my money. I don't know; seems like stealing to me."
2,Dusty lost his voice!,"I bought this for my son's 1st birthday and he immediately fell in love with it! He got it out everyday to vacuum and would want me to get mine out too. The sad part is that it lasted less than 5 months and now Dusty is no longer talking anymore. I tried replacing the batteries several times, but it still doesn't work. I think my son liked the sound of it vacuuming because it sounded like a real vacuum cleaner. The attachment does not stay hooked on and my son becomes very frustrated when it keeps popping off. Also, my son has a hard time getting the handle to come down to vacuum. You need hand/foot coordination to switch it from upright to the downward vacuuming positon. This is also frustrating because he usually can't get that by himself. I'm not surprised to be reading similar problems from others. This is a great idea, but it needs some work."
3,Nothing Outstanding,"My son loved this toy the first day, he was almost 18 months old. He's now 2 and he hardly ever plays with it. It's not loud enough to make him feel like it's real. He does like and reapeats what the vacuum says but there's nothing about this toy that makes it fabulous enough to spend $20 on it."
5,This toy is way overpriced on Amazon.,Just bought this today at Walgreens for $11.99 on sale. I am shocked at the price of this toy on Amazon. I also saw this toy at Marshalls recently going for $16.99. Hope this helps for those looking for this toy at a cheaper price.
5,It is a hit,"I bought this for my grandson, who loves to play with the small kitchen vacuum I used daily. I opened this up and put it together (just push the handle into the vacuum) and he played with it for hours (he's just one year). You can see the dirt in the bagless dirt container (really just yarn that rotates to look like dirt). It's a perfect height for this one year old and the handle is nice and thick. It's real easy to move back and forth. The hose part is a waste, but it's cute while it lasts. It stays put, even though it doesn't say hooked. It makes a motor sound and talks and the eyes move back and forth. It was a great buy and really cute toy. It's quickly become a favorite"
5,Modern Jazz Sound,"Modern Jazz Voicings teaches how to write in fourths, clusters and uppers structure triads in an easy way. The best feature in this book is the recording examples. Any book that claims to be a great arranging book needs to have decent recording examples. The readers can easily digest the techniques since they are available to their ears. Also, the recordings not only include horn section, but they use different orchestration to illustrate the voicings explained. Berklee teaches this course called as Chord Scale Theory. I strongly recommend this book."
5,"AWESOME brakes, low price","Dual pivot brakes for $22.00?!?!?!Front AND Rear?You just can't get this deal anywhere else.I bought a set, and have been using them this past summer on a single speed project I built.Couldn't be happier.Inexpensive, great stopping power, just a good purchase."
4,Great product for the price,"I bought this because I wanted an outdoor speaker that had usb support. Unit sounds great and is plenty powerful for a backyard. Only things that are ""wrong"" with it is that if you use an SD card through the USB port, it will only play the songs in order as there is no way to shuffle them. Also this unit has support for an Ipod which is great however it does not charge my 3rd gen Ipod touch and does not charge any of the Iphones that I have tried either. Other than those things though this item is definitely worth the price I paid and I am thinking about purchasing another one to make a more stereo sound for when I have parties and use it"
3,Windows 2000 beta drivers weak,"I have the 32MB version of this card in my (Dual boot Win98/2000 (linux when I get 'round to it) SCSI based Athlon) system. The DVD players are not reliable. I can't watch a movie in Win '98 without having at least a couple problems. Trying to watch one in Win2000, I'd have to reboot several times to get thru a movie. Win2000 beta support (versions 40wb10 and 70wb19) is weak; I sent in detailed problem reports ages ago. No response (admittedly they're in beta), but I'd expect at LEAST a new beta to have been released in the past few months. Winamp visualizations seem to cause W2k hangs too. The TV image is great, but the tv viewer also hangs quite often. (The system is reliable with basic stuff like MS Office & web dev tools.) The digital VCR only records at 25-30 frames a second. So I can't do 60fps to use like a TiVo, and can't do 2-10 frames a second for streaming over the web."
2,"Value in the vintage film, NOT the narrative or visuals (graphics.)","Not unlike other reviewers, I am pained by the poor writing and/or translation of the narration, as well as its delivery.I have Amazon Prime and this content is a portion of available streaming content... othewise, I would not pay to rent this series outright.The vintage film does make this an interesting watch, though."
4,Plush Zomba Hippo Review,"The toy is very nice, but not quite what I expected. I thought it would have a sound accessory inside, which was a part of my search criteria when looking for a plush hippo toy. The toy is well made, very soft, and will withstand a lot of handling and the loving play of an imaginative young child who enjoys collecting stuffed aniimals - the most important goal for this purchase. I regret it does not have the hippo sounds to go with it."
5,Loves it !,"My son started playing with this toy when he was 9 months (ignored it from 6 - 9 months) but we had to help him hold the giraffe up while he tried to put the blocks in. At 9 1/2 to 10 months this became one of his favorite toys, he is now 11 months and it is still going strong.*He learned to stand it back up at 10 months."
2,Tumbling is right,"I bought this Giraffe for my 8 month old who liked to take things out and was beginning to put things into containers. Well, the Giraffe falls down before he gets a chance to put the blocks into its mouth--someone has to sit next to him and hold the giraffe steady. However he loves playing with the blocks and throws them into a plain sand bucket. Skip the giraffe and just get the blocks."
3,Not as interesting as others,"While the giraffe is really cute, there is not much to this toy that may interest baby. Baby drops blocks into giraffe and is rewarded with a funny sound or musical note, but other than continually stacking, there is not much else to do. My child hasn't really been into it and would much rather play with his Peek-A-Blocks Circus Train."
3,Hit or Miss,"In general my daughter isn't a big fan of the blocks in this series...she tends to ignore them in favor of her other toys. The giraffe, however, she loves!! One day she discovered that she could walk around the house and drag the giraffe behind her (using the handle attached to his head) and ever since then, she drags the giraffe out at least once a day. (She is almost 19 months old now.)We don't even bother keeping the blocks in the giraffe any more because she is much more interested in stuffing other smallish toys into the giraffe and in dragging the empty giraffe around the house.This toy isn't the clear winner I was expecting it to be, but my child has found a way to make it work for her. My suggestion to other parents is first to buy a set of the blocks and see if your child likes them--and if she does, then go ahead and buy the accessories like the giraffe."
5,classic star trek!!!,"i am not a fan of the original star trek, however there are a couple of episodes that have been undeniable classics. all of which appear on this convenient dvd. i was far too young for the original series, but have been a life-long fan of TNG. if you need classic sci-fi doled out in small pieces i highly recommend this title."
1,Forces you to watch 3 minute charm commercial,"DVDs that force you to watch commercials without giving you the option to fast-forward, get low stars from me. Some may say it is not apart of the show, but if that were so, why can't I move past them the same way I can fast-forward the trek episode shows?Each time I put this disk in, I have to watch the same commercials over and over, with out being able to bypass them...uhg."
5,Perm Rods,"I have not used these perm rods yet. They are the size I need, so I am sure, I will be satisfied."
5,Nice quality portfolio,"I bought this to hold my 8-1/2"" x 11"" tablet and business cards, replacing an older and cheaper vinyl one my employer gave me. That one lasted 15 years, and since this one is all leather, I hope it outlasts me. It seems to be nicely made, has a fine appearance, and is obviously a quality product. There is no zipper or latch to keep it closed, so it flips open quickly when needed."
2,More like the TV Blunder,"This was a good starter card for watching television through my computer. It worked well with Windows 98, but if you were thinking of using it with any operating system released this century, you'd find yourself out of luck. Initially, with 98, I thought very highly of the TV Wonder. However, upon upgrading to Windows 2000, I had to download extra drivers from ATI which ended up locking up the computer after watching TV for more than a few minutes. After that, I thought XP would handle it a little better. Unfortunately, it was worse. I couldn't find any software support from ATI that would co-exist with Windows XP, and have yet to.In retrospect, I probably should have gone with the TV Wonder VE which is compatible with Windows XP after downloading an updated driver from ATI's site."
1,It's as if they want people to return their product...,"I was very excited to buy this product after seeing all the great features it had. I heard that some people could not get it to work, so I was skeptical; however based on what the box said, my video card (Nvidia Riva TNT2) was compatible.After I installed the drivers to my Windows 98 SE 900Mhz computer, Windows failed to boot. I called tech support (no toll free number, had to pay long distance fees) and they had no idea how to repair their crap-for-drivers. I was very disapointed and had to return the card. Very, very bad choice."
3,Needs to be updated post-standardization,"While helpful, it can be confusing for those not raised in Mohawk-speaking environments. The orthography used is not the standardized orthography that was set beginning in 1993. Thus, the words need to be transcribed from the old to the new system. This doesn't make it value-less, but something to be noted for new learners."
1,WORTHLESS AS A STEP BY STEP GUIDE.,"I just finished reading this book and I was totally disappointed. The book makes alot of claims, but can it deliver? My step-sister just told the family that she wants to become a porn star, we have other relatives in the business, so we read this book to try and get a starting point for her. This book is way off to say the least. Some of the interviews are with people that we consider ghosts, some of the so-called up to date numbers are not so up-to date and the step by step guide is not as easy to follow as it sounds. The insight in the adult industry is pretty much accurate in this book, but the book leaves out alot of useful information such as the reality of the business. anyways, I thought this book sucked..............."
5,all the info we needed to get started,This book had all the info we needed to get started. I am making my debut in a film called gerald and roel's excellent adventure.
4,All my love,This book is really informative. I'm a hands on kind of girl and this book gave me all the instructions i ever could have wanted. It's easy and went right in to my mind.
4,I'm a nurse and want to be a porn star,"This book makes me want to get nailed by six guys at once! In front of a camara, of course! This is a must read for a porn enthusiest or anyone thinking of entering the business!."
4,concise and to the point,"This book is a very helpful pocket book for both Cardiovascular medicine fellows, Medical residents, practising cardiologists as well as any physician with a true interest in evidence supported management of cardiovascular disease. The most relevant large scale trials are reviewed in support of standards of care or consensus guidelines set out in the book. It also does a good job of covering the broad spectrum of cardiology. It definitely merits at least 4 stars"
3,Too expensive.,"This is a great book. Even though I am not a musician, I love Northern Indian Classical Music. This book does a good job explaining the theory behind the music. Like everything you pay for quality. As good as this book is I belive that $59.00 is way to expensive. Wait till the price comes down, or you can get a used copy. Don't pay full price."
4,Kitchenaid makes solid stuff,"I had a hand blender before this. The price point was attractive and we had been doing a lot of baking.This is a solidly made, easy to use tool. I would definitely recommend it. Pros - blends splendidly, no splashing or mess. Cons - Heavy and takes up a bit of room. Also, it took me a few tries to realize you have to click in the tab on the back of the bowl to firmly anchor it. It will still work if you don't but moves around.Overall - very happy with my reconditioned purchase for the price."
3,"Magical Partnership, but...","Compared to other Francescatti Biddulph reissues I own,Bach: Violin Concerto No. 2 in E; Partita No. 2 in D minor; Partita No. 3 in EandZino Francescatti Plays Beethoven(see my reviews), this CD of Violin Sonatas left me cold. The violinist had a magical partnership with pianist Robert Casadesus, and while that is clearly evident at times here, the overall poor sound prevents the full realization of that goal. In fact the 1950 recordings of the Mozart and Beethoven sonatas sound better than the tinny, brittle 1954 account of the Bach -- go figure! I'm glad I found this title inexpensively in the Marketplace because I'd be mad if I'd paid full price for such mediocre sound."
1,defective disc,"Disc two was defective. Episodes 10 through 14 would not play on either of my DVD players. Nobody else seems to have this problem. I had never gotten any cooperation from Amazon before when I received defective items, so I didn't try to replace it. The other discs worked, and I couldn't stand any more aggravation. I have since been able to return one item for a full refund when it was not the item I ordered, but they won't let me return this item now."
4,Additional info,Amazon offered this free and very interesting additional material over the second season of Batman: The Animated Series. This is very informative and gives you a better idea about the producers and writers ideas and intent. This is typically found as the extras on the dvd's.
1,STUPIDEST GAME IN THE UNIVERSE. NOT EVEN WORTH 1 STAR.,This is the worsest gsme ive ever played in the univeres. It sooooooooooooooooooo boring. The only thing u do is try to find all of the stuff. it has very bad graphics and everything. I HATE this game DONT EVER BUY IT. YOU'LL BE SORRY IF U BUY IT. DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY. THIS IS THE BORINGEST GAME IVE EVER PLAYED. EVEN WORSER THAN SONIC HEAROS. jUST DONT BUY IT.
4,New Idea,"You really think this is going on now given the old spy vs. spy, east vs. west game is over. This may be pulled from CIA case files for all we know. The book has a new twist on the old favorite espionage thriller. The author does a very good job of making it believable. The story keeps moving though out the book. You really get to know the main characters of the book and you also get a good feel for Berlin. The book is not bad and is worth the time."
5,Norman ages like Kentucky bourbon,"This is another fine album by Norman, complete with more of his increasingly impressive original body of work (""Whiskey Deaf and Whiskey Blind"", for one) and fine takes on old standards (""Give Me Back my 15 Cents""). Pure, simple, and truly beautiful music. Norman is as artist of the highest caliber, and this music reflects his loving preoccupation with old-time tones and archaic poetry. A must-have for Norman fans."
2,In Concert: Live at the Music Hall-The Mighty Clouds of Joy,The first songs on the CD had poor quality sound. Its to much talking before you get to the actual song.
3,Just too big...,"Built very solid! The size that everyone is mentioning cannot be over stated. It is massive. Mine arrived with the Swiss Legend wooden box damaged, but I thought no biggie. I tried to wear it around the house to get use to it. I like to wear 42-46mm watches, but this was was just too big and heavy for me. It almost looks like a toy because it's so big."
3,Good basic overview,"Clash of Titans covers all of the major naval actions in World War II at a basic level, but none deeply. If you've read any of the innumerable detailed volumes on some of the more notable battles, you'll want to skip right over Boyne's description of that battle. However, if you're looking for areas to discover more deeply, Clash of Titans can be a good first step. Unfortunately, there's little discussion of doctrine or design philosophy, so one gets more of an idea of what people do rather than why they do it."
2,Not for damaged hair!,"i had very high hopes for this product. my hair was shoulder length and severly damaged by a bleaching job, thus breaking in the front and overly dry. the shampoo made this a million times worse - my hair became so dry it was almost unmanageable. i also bought the conditioner, but it didn't soften my hair at all. for me it was a huge waste of money and i wish it had been clear that the use of this shampoo on damaged hair will not only reverse the condition, but make it worse. i do not know how it works on people with normal hair - i just can say that for me it was the wrong purchase."
1,i hate this shampoo,Yes this shampoo maid my moms hair fall out i would like my money back to put back on my dads credit card my mom hates this nisim stuff we want are money back
3,Like of books of this nature,"This book was well written and organized in a fashion which is easy to follow and understand. Still, there wasn't really anything new here. Only book on this subject that is different and a bit more truth driven is The Renegade Writer.Although I only gave it 3 stars, it is one you might find used and spend less than cover for - might be nice to have in reference library."
2,Useful but...,"There is good information in this book but the authors reveal a startling lack of integrity when, in Chapter 4, they include anonymous entries from people describing how they pursue freelance projects at their full-time jobs. Stealing time from employers goes on all the time but it is unethical and is to blame for much of the decline of workplace productivity in this country. For the authors to encourage it undermines the validity and integrity of the rest of their book."
2,Poor and good sampling,"This is a sample - or as it seems a deliberate pick - of twelve pieces from a big set of ten CD's ""How the West Was Swung"". I have not heard these, so a part of this review is guess work. Well then, there is no reason to get excited about this CD. It seems to be a deliberate pick, but the real reasoning ('Why these tracks?') is not explained in the booklet. Tom Morrell knows a steel guitar, sure enough. Listen to one hot ripping track (#5). Sadly, the rest is ""allrightish"" at best, and some tracks however do not arise above the ""uninspired"" level. Furthermore, the CD's sound quality is not that good, so that does not help either.So at last, this CD does not promise many hightlights in the complete set of How the West was Swung. Did the track pickers of ""Wolf Tracks"" do a good job ? I am afraid they did just that."
2,A foul Phule,"This book was a great disappointment, Captain Jester was either brain damaged by the nano's, on drugs, or replaced by a robot for the entire book. The few times he appears his is agonizing over a promotion and contributing nothing towards the plot or story line. Beeker is meaner, more sarcastic, and instead of being Phules friend he is just a critic. In all I thought all the characters and indeed the entire book was smaller and meaner than the previous installments.It may be a good read for someone who has not read the previous installments but a fan will not like it."
4,More grownup upgrade from the little Little People,"My 3.5 year old had grown bored with her other Little People toys (bummer since we have so many), when she spots this in the FP catalogue and had to have it. She has played with it everyday for the last 3 weeks and even combines it with her beloved Diego toys - finally giving Diego a playmate :) The girls' legs bend and they can twist at the waist, but the arms are immobile. The parts that come with this set are big enough that I feel comfortable letting my baby play with them too. I love that it comes with so many pieces; it really offers a lot of creative options. It doesnt' all quite fit in easily into the camper for storage, but I'd recommend this to any boy or girl who need a more grown up pretend play toy."
4,A Good Blues Album,"I really enjoy listening to this album. If you can find it, it is well worth your money. These guys are a more local band from the Twin Cities. If you love blues music, you should definitelly check them out."
5,Excellent series on God's promises,"We are finishing up the 10-week series and I would highly recommend it to any women's group wanting to go deeper in their understanding of God's promises. This study started in response to going through difficult times and has been of great encouragement and a blessing as our group has walked through this together. The DVD had us laughing and crying; and smiling again as we learned how God has the answer, again and again, and this was so encouraging.The participants guide has additional material that can be done through the week, to go deeper in your study. The questions for discussion were so popular it was a hard to end each lesson and end for the night. And I was blessed by how much this helped old and recent hurts and the healing that happened. Already I'm being asked when Sheila's next series is. The response to this study has been wonderful."
5,These are wonderful!,"I love these crackers, and so does my 17 month old son. They taste better to me than other brands who make a similar product, and I don't have to feel as nervous about myself or my son eating them because they are made with all natural, all organic ingredients. I will never, ever buy the other big brands again!"
5,2003 will be a very bad year!,Now that I have this calendar. I love all the little tidbits of badness scattered throughout. The Bad Girl Power profiles are way cool too. Every week is filled with something really baaaaaaad to do to celebrate the Bad Life. I'd give it as a gift but I want to keep it all to myself.
4,AWESOME,This book is great for those just starting a drama ministry for youth and teens in thye church.
1,falls short,I don't think elvis meant this cd to be released. Elvis is an exceptional entertainer and this cd falls very short of his usual recordings. There are songs listed here that are really just short converations and I was hoping to hear him sing the whole song. I would not buy this cd if I was thinking I was getting 47 songs. This cd is really disappointing and I'm surprised that it's on the market.
3,Johnny Knew,"Johnny Cash wrote about these recordings in his 1970's autobiography ""Man In Black"". He thought the recordings were lost, or locked in a vault somewhere. I know that Johnny is on this cd, you can hear him singing bass quite lowly on ""Farther Along""(listen closely)."
2,Very Poor Sound Quality,"I bought this like everyone with very high expectations, but what I got was extremely POOR sound quality. About all you can hear is Elvis, and not all that well, singing. As nice as it would be to have ALL singers creating a true quartet, this just isn't what you get. Save your money."
3,Hot dog Cart,okay so we just got it today and we will try it out and write another review wwhen tested but so far so good and we hope for good results will change after fully tested and assembled so please continue to look for next review http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MX92P4/ref=oh_o00_s00_i00_details
3,The Mood Has to be Right,"Regina Belle is one of my favorite artist. However, I agree with the listener from Connecticut - I listened to this cd once and the only reason I rediscovered it is that my apartment was robbed and this was one of the few cds left. Believe in Me and Can't We Fall in Love Again are my favorites. I gave it three stars because it doesn't stand up to her other cds."
1,Not working for Zen products !,"Sold to me as a ""Creative Zen Micro Photo travel wall charger"" (they removed the ""Photo"" since then apparently), this thing, designed for cell phones as written on the package, does simply not work at all to charge this product, even after a replacement. I asked for a refund."
1,"Old fond paradoxes, to make fools laugh...","Wall covers oft-trodden ground here and offers little more than a tormented, navel-gazing faux-academic hero to pursue the well-worn conundrum of the Shakespearean authorship ""question"" -- which is only a question for conspiracy theorists who don't find the intricacies of real history interesting enough. This theme has been much more entertainingly addressed by Michael Malone, George Garrett, Charles Nicholl, Peter Whelan, and many more."
5,Memories....,This CD brought back alot of memories from high school and I highly recommend getting it if you enjoy old school hip-hop/rap.
3,Orthodox Prayer Book,"This prayer book works for some and not for others. I did not like it because I waslooking for a book that had reasonable sets of prayers for different times of the dayand this book had many very long prayers, too long for me. It also did nothave enough prayers for different needs. So I sent it back. Binding and paperand print quality were good though."
1,HORRIBLE business practice,I ordered this product several weeks ahead of my sister's birthday. After days and days of not hearing anything about its status I emailed but got no reply. Finally Amazon notified me two days before her birthday that the item was out of stock. This was extremely important and I am furious.
4,Top Cat review,"Considering that no-one at the time even thought about video transfer, much less DVD, the quality of the DVD is fantastic. Testing it on three players showed no problem at all (Australia is PAL, the DVD NTSC).Not many people remember Top Cat, But in Australia he was played/repeated until at least the seventies. I'd forgotten all about him, but my mum remembers it fondly .In fact she's the reason I bought it(birthday present).If your a fan of Hanna-Barbera,add this to your collection.If not,start now !Shipping to Australia was only $7.00 and arrived right on time. Better than another firm which charged USD25.00 to ship a 12"" x 32"" rolled poster ! Well done Amazon."
2,If it dies after 9 mos. you have to pay $25 labor fee for repair,"This MP3 player worked fine since I purchased it 9 months ago for my son. However, it is now dead without having been damaged or mistreated in any way. After attempting to get an RMA for a warranty return on the Creative website I found that the 12 month warranty is only for hardware parts, NOT labor. So to continue the return process for this player I was going to have to enter my credit card information and be charged $25, then add the cost of shipping it to them. NO WAY.I've had much better experiences with iRiver players and will stick with them from now on. I'm done with Creative.UPDATE*** 10/31/11Actually, I wound up replacing the dead Creative player with a Sansa MP3 player and it has performed flawlessly. I've since purchased more Sansa players for my other kids and myself, which have all served us without a glitch. I highly recommend them. I still feel strongly that I'll never buy another Creative product again."
5,Everything about rpgs up to 1991,"Complete compendium of RPGs from their origins up to 1991. Includes excerpts from interviews, lists and commentary by the author. It's the sine qua non book for the true collector."
2,Sexual and gender identity chapter co-authored by Rekers.,"George Rekers, the Baptist minister and psychologist who is also one of America's leading anti-gay activists, coauthored the chapter on sexual and gender identity disorders in this book. This is the guy who was just caught taking a rent boy on a European vacation. He also coauthored the chapter on ethical, legal and multicultural issues in mental healthcare. Hmmmm. I think I'll take a pass on this one, thanks."
4,Great live recordings,"This album captures the raw sound of live performances from the Jimi Hendrix Experience performed in the studio for the BBC for radio broadcast. A mix of favorites songs and rarities the Jimi Hendrix Experience never recorded for release. After you have all three of the Jimi Hendrix Experience albums (Are You Experienced, Axis: Bold as Love, and Electric Ladyland) as well as Band of Gypsys and First Rays of the New Rising Sun, get this. My only complaint about this album is that they could have fit more of the interview segments on here."
5,How couldn't You!,My son has a heel problem so he needs a basketball sneaker that is kind of tight around the heel and comfortable.These shoes are the perfect ones! I cant't believe i saw these sneakers!They are also very fit in!
1,It should be against the law to sell this to a Bruce Lee fan,"When I first purchased this DVD I was thrilled to finally be able to replace my worn out originals on VHS. Then I watched them... and something was a little off. For starters the video transfer wasn't really much better than VHS, it would seem they just recorded a VHS on DVD without bothering to find a master print. Then I notice that the movie was dramatically cut. Scenes where either missing, or trimmed down. It's like they used a made for TV cut of both the films. If it weren't for the fact that it came from a store I'd say this was just a cheap bootleg. I'd save my money and by something more useful instead, like a pack of gum.On a bonus side This could be a way to allow you children to watch a Bruce Lee movie without any nudity and toned down violence at least compared to the originals.P.S.This version of Chinese Connection\ the real ""Fist of Fury"" Has a terrible dub that could really use an update."
3,"musically simplistic and unoriginal, vocals fantastic!","as a longtime fan of afi (since 1996)i snatched this cd up as soon as possible. what i got was old school buzzsaw guitars,sluggish rhythms, and davey havok doing some of his finest work yet. there is nothing too exciting here. 'MICHAEL'is a great song, the best of the album, and one that will stick in your head. the rest is decent, but i'd rather pick up any afi cd over this. davey havok makes it worth listening to."
4,"Concise, detailed, accurate, but no illustrations.","If you want a throrough history of the knights templars, plus a review of all the conspiracy theories of how it allegedly survives to the present day this may be your book. However, one of the reasons I bought this book was out of nostalgia for knights in shining armor and my inner history buff's infatuation with the crusades. The lack of colored pictures makes me think I should have bought another book, or at least a more illustrated one in addition to this. This is more suited to those who just want the historical facts and post disbandment theories in a short amount of time. I did buy the downloadable PC game Medieval: Total War, which did satisfy my desire to see Templars in action in full color, also from Amazon. So I guess I used this book as something of an historical companion to it."
3,holes,it was ok it was sort of boring but then at the same time i wanted to keep reading the book but u should read it because its a verry good book
5,A Book To Remember,"I am a 27 year old woman and I remember loving this book. Although I can't remember too many specifics, this book always pops in my mind when recalling the joy of reading as a kid. I remeber being able to relate to the book. As a girl I also recall feeling as if I had some insight as to what was going on in the minds of boys. Great book. I do also agree with the reviewer who said that there was some questionable language in this book but that was part of the fun. The book reads just as if you are living this boys life. I believe the connection kids will feel with this book and the pleasure of reading they will feel is greatly outweighed by the qestions effects this MIGHT have on a younger reader. Besides, I didn't read about anything in this book that I wasn't exposed to in my everyday life in junior high."
1,Waste of money,"CRC books are normally very good but this is a total waste of money - entries have very little information comprising a standard name , main effects (eg ""antiseptic"") , some tested doses, occasionally an LD50 . No CAS numbers or IUPAC etc names are included and there is no index (eg to locate all ""antimalarials"" ) - you can only look by alphabetical order of the standard name used. A book that will go onto my bookshelf & probably never accessed again"
3,"Great story, disappointing 'mini' format","I love the Munsch books and this is my absolute favorite. So I ordered it, with 2 others, as a present for a little girl I know. I was deeply disappointed when I found that this was a ""mini"" book. Rather than being the typical size Munsch book that I have bought in the past (maybe 8"" x 6""), this was only about 3"" square. The story is good and I guess the price should have been a tip-off. When I looked the item up today, I could not find anything in the description that mentioned the size. By clicking on a link I found that there were other 'formats' but as far as I could tell, none of them mentioned a size. Possibly the older version is more normal."
1,book,"The book itself was wonderful, the shipper also, received the book in in great condition. It just was not the SIZE i was expecting it to be. It was a tiny 2x2 book."
2,"Purple, Green and Yellow",Never expected it to be so small. I checked to see where the size of the book was written and never saw it listed.
1,Warning! Book is the size of a cookie,"Maybe I missed it somewhere in the description, but I didn't realize this was a minibook about the size of a chocolate chip cookie. The story is too juvenile for my niece who can read and is into anything small and the small print, lots of text and tiny pictures don't work for my four year old."
2,micro book,I love this story but when ordered did not realize this book was a microversion. Very disappointed with that. There was nothing in the ad that stated it was a mini version of the book. When I was gettng ready to throw out the box is when I found the book. It should be boldy stated that this a mini version of the book!!!!
2,Should indicate size,"Just know that this is a (very) mini book. I ordered it to read to a group of children and, imagine my surprise when I pulled it from the bottom of the box! Needless to say, a quick trip to the library was in order."
2,Just OK,I wasn't crazy about this bar. It tastes kind of like dates and leaves a weird aftertaste in your mouth.
5,Great,Love it. It is a great bike it goes very fast for the price. Doesnt take that long to charge(6 hours). I am a kid and love it.
2,Too much for me,"I don't consider myself an expert in harder music, especially punk. I like my melodies pretty, my guitars acoustic, my words understandable. Despite this, on a recommendation of a friend, I picked up this album, figuring it might be the best way to get into the Blossoms, one of the premier punk bands of the nineties. Although I can see where the Gin Blossoms were going with their sound, it's all just a little too heavy (and angry) to be successful. That's a problem with a lot of punk music, in my opinion. The execution overwhelms the intent.I am not going to say this wasn't a good band, especially placed in the context of the other punk bands of the period. It's just not for me. I think I may swap this for a little Phil Collins - now that's some music I can dig!"
2,Can sing & play instruments but song writing is lacking!,"Can sing & play instruments but song writing is lacking! Like so many groups, they are talented musicians and the singing is fine. The big problem is that the songs sound generic...too much like a hundred other bands. The time of the ""memorable tune"" that grabs you immediately and lives on in memory seems to have passed. It is a rarity now when a piece of music stands out from all the others...this isn't a band that seems to be able to do this."
1,Weak Blubber,"Go ahead and pass on this, blow your wad on a better burn of the original.Just not fun."
4,Trekking Our Inner Histories,"I would have been entertained by Bram's ingenious plot line and the remarkable use he makes of historical mileposts, from the Civil War to the great Coney Island Dreamland fire; trekking from Norfolk to New York to Constantinople over more than half a century. Those mileposts are parts of us through life's reading, travel, modern media. Colorful descriptions throughout give emotional and nostalgic thrills. Bravo to wonderful story telling! But the most joy came from immersing me in my great personal issues - race and its inexplicable importance in our society - my life's joys and fears in sexuality - and my regrets at living comfortably for 74 years within society's rules. My vicarious journey with Dr. August and his loves was an intellectual and erotic pleasure."
2,Went on easy instructions easy to follow,I like others got a rip the first time puting it on. Otherwise install was great. I live in kansas where the winds can get up a little bit. 3rd month of using it winds got up about 20 MPH tore this thing to shreds. Says heavy duty but does not hold up!!! Would not buy another one. This was not cheap and I expected more.
2,What you get when you cross Neil Diamond & Franz Ferdinand,"I bought this cd because I heard the catchy ""Hannah We Known"" on their My Space page. I wished I hadn't purchased this. There's a forced quality to their music, like they went into the studio saying ""we're making a hit album,"" & then wrote songs so cliched & derivative as to be sure to get on the airwaves. Also, some of the worst lyrics I've heard in a long time can be heard here. I don't know if the lead singer is really trying to channel Neil Diamond circa 1974, but he does a great job of it. Just go buy ""Franz Ferdinand."" You'll get the same sound only with stronger songs & less Neil."
4,floridian rating the floridians,"amazing, amazing peace of music. songs like she's a freak and just right make you wanna jump up and just scream ""YEAH!"" this album is good for fans of NIN, system of a down & taproot."
4,Great Read.,Just finished this book last week. Hart did a terrific job of explaining events and intertwining them with first person accounts of the action. This terrible battle is brought to life for the reader and you get a graphic sense of what it was to fight and die in the Somme. I enjoyed the book very much and plan on reading other books by Peter Hart in the future. Good Read.
5,A Great Philosopher!,"I recently bought this album and enjoyed it from the first time I heard it. I am a huge fan of Styx, especially of Dennis DeYoung! In my opinion, he is more than a great singer, he is a great philosopher. His songs help me get through difficult situations I go through nearly everyday. He has given me something to believe in. Thank you Dennis, for everything!"
2,A used pair,"The product itself is absolutely a wondering job, it fits well and looked pretty. However it was a used pair, not only of that, one of the shoes seems to have been repaired. I had to wait and change to another pair, few weeks later I got the response that the product is no longer available. I finally had to send it back and paid for the shipping fee by the way."
4,Pacific Coast Highway,"Nils is great. The album lets his guitar talent shine through. If you like smooth jazz, this is a great one."
4,Good for Learning and Reference,This book has been a great source of information and has helped to improve my game. The author does a good job of identifying the different aspects of the game and describes each well. The various shot drills and court diagrams are also a great learning tool. Anyone who wants to improve their racquetball and follows this manual can't help but get better.
3,OK AT BEST,"MY TITLE SUMS IT UP.DIMMU OR CRADLE THEY ARE NOT.STILL THAT SAME DRUM SOUND FROM THE SADUS DAYS.THE VOCALS ARE WEAK.STICK WITH CRADLE,THEIR NEWEST SHREDS ONES LIKE THIS UP."
1,Asleep on the Beach in Ibiza !!,"Mr. Carrol misses the mark with this one !! The music style is the popular ""progressive"" style which tries to infuse the funk of disco and trance together into what we call ""patio music"" at ClubSpace in Miami. Trouble with this mix is that the track selection lacks energy...you keep waiting for a tune to pull you to your feet and it never comes !! My compliments to the cover artist though....it has a nice packaging job....but as your Mom warned you....don't be pulled in by pretty packages !! Save your money...even at used cd prices its not worth it !!"
2,Doesn't fit.,"This doesn't fit a standard-sized visor, nevermind a large one--we drive a Grand Am, and this is not a huge car or a huge visor.Think about getting one that has adjustable straps (I know Case Logic makes them) instead of this, which will be going to Goodwill.The material of the sleeves is also thinner than I've seen in other models, and will probably wear out quickly with repeated use. Think about a different purchase."
2,Just be careful in the heat.,"This is great to quickly and temporarily organize a few CDs/DVDs in your car but just be careful when it gets hot. My CDs and DVDs ended up warped and un-useable because the sleeve holds them tight together and since they're staggered it pushes one onto the other and with the heat, bends them. I have since removed it from my car and no longer use it because of this issue."
2,Would not recommend this,I thought this DVD would go over each Tarot Card and the meaning. This DVD is just a few sample spread and the meaning. Not good for a beginner at all. Fagetaboutit
3,But I will let you know more later,"... after I have read it! This book was a gift to myself, at the recommendation of an authoress whom I respect as a writer and reader. So now, I must set aside some time to begin reading it!"
4,Nice and heavy,"It's agood album for a new band, even though they have released a few cd's before this. It sound melodic and heavy here and there. Great job, FTC."
5,Good looking and comfortable!,"I love these shoes and have them in several colors: black, candy, taupe and now getting them in cafe. I walk in these for hours and they are really comfortable. The Amazon sale price is an incredible bargain!"
4,I'm still a 'Star Gazer' at heart.,"Got this book back in 1974 from a family member. For more than 3 year I used this book as a guide to know what was in the sky on almost any given clear night, during all seasons. Thankfully it is a hard cover book or it would be more ragged than it is."
5,Love it!,Such a great pair of earrings for the price. They are even prettier in reality than the picture. The earrings' post is long enough so that the child can continue to wear them as he/she grows. The screwback works great - we haven't lost one yet!
2,Its a enlarged pic of very small ear ring,"The pic shown on the website is an enlarged pic of the actual item. It doesn't look as pretty as shown in the pic, so I returned the item."
1,Avoid this junk card,"No wonder why this card was only $9.95 at a retail store. I got what I paid for. Unbelievably slow speeds and constant disconnects. I took it back for a refund and got a Netgear card, no more problems. When it comes to wireless products its best to stay with reputable brands (Netgear, Belkin, D-Link..)."
5,long time satisfied user of this item,I have had one of these pants pressing things for 20 years now. I am very satisfied with the performance for pressing dress pants (wool). I use is every day when I return from work. Yes you want to be moderately careful about placement of pants into the machine but I have not had a problem with it. It has saved me plenty in dry cleaning bills and the pants last longer since they are not going through the dry cleaning process nearly as often.
2,Out of date & insufficient,"Errors and mistakes aside, this book is really outdated. I can't imagine nothing has changed since 1982. The model tests, the listening part in particular, are not so helpful for all three tests used pretty much the same material even though the structures are changed. By the third time around, the student is of course more familiar with the ""quesitons and statements"" and therefore more likely to make a correct choice, which, unfortunately, is not going to be the case in the real test. Also there is no clear explanation on how to grade the test and convert the scores. The student is left clueless after studying the book as to what kind of score he or she is likely to get it if he or she is to take the text at that point. What is more disappointing is this seems be the ONLY guide available for the Michigan Test. You ESL educators out there, what's going on?"
5,GREAT cookbook!!!,"This is the best cookbook I have ever bought. I have made more of the recipes out of this cookbook than any of the other cookbooks I have ever owned(which is not a small number). The dishes are fantastic, simple and ""normal"" food. I especially enjoyed the restaurant recipes in the back."
3,HATE the zipper cover,"The STAR zipper cover on this item makes it so annoying. My baby kept trying to get the piece of fabric off his chin. The fabric is really soft though... Anyway, I found that the Carter's version of this is MUCH better. The fabric is still soft, they have great patterns and the zipper cover is just a tab covering the zipper that will not get in your babies face. I got mine at Target for $8.99 each. The brand is actually ""Just One You"" by Carters"
2,Pitiful,"I rented this game and thought it was crap. Gameplay isn't any good; Sound and music is the same as any other Lucas game; Graphics are ok, and some of the creatures are nifty looking. Controls aren't very good either. 2 player mode is kinda fun. Might as well take your 50 bucks somewhere else. So thanks, Lucas, for another pitiful game."
2,Bottom pan in both litter boxes cracked!!!,"At first these were terrific replacement litter pans for my four felines. Five litter pans for the convenience and comforts of my felines. But, after one year the bottom pans have huge cracks on the sides in the plastic. There is no reason except defective products. I would go back to the store where purchased but they were swallowed up by the Recession. So, now I am on a litter pan quest...one that lasts longer than one year!"
5,Always good reading,Love the ongoing story of Charlotte LaRue and her family. It is interesting as she has customers in her books from previous books too. She describes New Orleans also which for someone who has never been there is interesting and I can picture the places she is describing. Quite a sense of humor and the plot keeps you interested. Feel like I know this person personally.
3,"good mystery, heroine needs fleshing out","this is the second mystery in the series that i have read. i like the mysteries fine, but i find charlotte a bit smug and self righteous. she seems overly concerned with her age and going senile and with all her preaching and rules, seems quick to judge others and seems to utterly lack any joy in her life. my main criticism would be for charlotte to loosen up and enjoy life. the other one would be to flesh out the secondary characters a bit more - especially louis. great mysteries - but please give charlotte a sense of humor, get her off her high horse and give her a little romance in her life. truthfully, she is dull as dishwater. however, i truly enjoy the mystery and will continue the series while holding out the hope that charlotte will improve with age."
2,Cleans well but plastic breaks often,"I loved this vacuum when I bought it and told all my friends how it was a great vacuum. But, now 2 1/2 years later, I have had 3 different parts break, and one of the replacement parts broke. That means something breaks on average every six months.... and we just use it around our house. The reality is the pieces seem to be made of a pretty cheap plastic. I've had a cylinder break. The wand broke and then the replacement wand broke. And today the plastic nozzle at the end of the hose broke. We called Dyson to complain and was told that the warranty was up in 2 years and we were out of luck. Had to buy the new hose at $47. The agent wasn't helpful or sympathetic at all and the fact this is the fourth time we have had to replace something meant nothing to them. I definitely do not recommend this vacuum because at this price, it should clean well and the pieces should stand up to general home use for years and years."
2,Great Suction - Poor Hoses and Parts,"I have owned 3 of these (extended service plan has allowed me to do that). All 3 vacs did the same thing. First the stair attachment comes apart at the elbow of the attachement itself (it should be made one piece). Then, the hose tears on the hand held piece. And lastly, the hose tears that leads from the rotating broom into the cannister. Believe it or not this vacuum is so powerful that I can still use it with all of these tears but it doesn't work nearly as well as when it was new.If Dyson could just make the hoses and the attachments better this would be the ultimate vacuum! My extended warranty has now expired and I will not be buying another Dyson."
3,"Dosent have a ""blower"", quick draw hose isn't exactly quick..","The vacuum is great for the suction. However, it has 2 flaws:1. You cannot use it as a ""blower"". Its like a fundamental feature of most of the vacuums i have used in the past. I had to get my old vacuum to blow the leaves off our patio.2. The quick draw hose is very cumbersome and complicated. You have to actually remove the hose from the pipe (which is a pain), and reverse it and attach it. I would highly recommend to go to a store and check this out before you get it.I gave it 3 stars because the price is too high for such drawbacks."
2,Oringinal equipment switch,"I was purchasing a Dyson ORIGINAL equipment filter and was willing to pay the extra amount, (10.00) for it.Instead, I received an aftermarket, packaging cut away, in a used, dirty Stouffers dinner box! Definitly did not feel like I received value for my money. Return address was MY GOD of Lansing Mich. I think it came from EBAY!"
2,"Nice vacuum, horrible attachments","The vacuum gets 5 stars.The attachments get negative 3 stars.I love the vacuum, does not lose suction. However I know 5 people with this model and all of us have had the Stairs attachment and the Large Brush attachment break. Gets very frustrating when doing stairs and having to try to use the whole vacuum because the attachment broke.For $400 you would expect better quality. The guy in the commercials should work on using a smarter plastic or something as clearly everyone is having the same problem. My old school Hoover atatchments never broke!"
2,Nothing Special,"I bought this vacuum about a year and half ago and was very disappointed from the start. I was excited to purchase this machine b/c of all of the hype surrounding it. My husband was against spending the money but I insisted. Boy, have I been regretting that decision.The first time I used it I saw that it didn't do anything better than the hoover windtunnel I was replacing. It takes several passes to pick up the smallest crumbs left on the carpet by my toddlers. It frequently passes over a piece of cheerio and won't pick it up. This vacuum is so weak, I can go over a small, lightweight area rug without having to hold it down with one foot. It also has a high clearance so you can't get under the edge of cabinets, furniture, etc.I gave it two starts b/c the hose suction is very strong and the darn machine just won't seem to die. I keep hoping it will burn out so I can justify spending $ on a new vacuum.Just pass on this one folks. It's not worth your hard earned money."
3,"It's OK, but not as great as some would have you believe.","OK, I needed a new vacuum cleaner and bought into the Dyson mystique. Went to Bed Bath & Beyond this afternoon and purchased one. (TIP: If you get those 20% off coupons in the mail from BB&B;, you can save $80 on this baby.) I put the vac together as soon as I got home, anxious to test out this legendary piece of equipment. I can only say that I'm underwhelmed. It did an OK job, but none of those ""emptied the canister 28 times in a 10x10 room"" experiences that others are having. All I can say is, some of you must have REEEEEEALLY dirty houses, lol. I'll probably keep the Dyson because it does seem to do a decent job and I'm too lazy to pack it back up and drive 20 miles to return it. I'm not at all sure that it's worth the $320 that I paid for it and I probably would be as happy with another Hoover.Update: OK, I DID pack it up and returned it. HATED the way the handle had to be removed and switched around in order to use the tools."
1,Overpriced and engineered by someone who never vacuumed a floor,"First it weighs a ton. You must be physically fit to carry it upstairs. Second the filter clogs in two weeks, not six months. Third it loses suction at the drop of a pin. Fourth it makes a horrible racket if it doesn't like the thinness of the rug you are vacuuming. I have a cleaner by Hoover that cost a third the price and does ten times the job with minimal maintenance. I estimate I spend two hours a month at least trying to get my Dyson Animal to suck up a little dirt. Ugh. Don't buy it.UPDATE: After years of fiddling with this piece of over-designed, under-engineered junk, I put it on the street. Honestly, I felt guilty doing that to some innocent scavenger but I was mad as hell and I just couldn't take it anymore."
1,service is awful,"if you need assiatance (i.e., need a part), dont waste your time with these idiots. my dogs are more helpful."
2,THESE ARE SELF-PROMOTING REVIEWS!!,"I became suspicious while researching vacuums on this sight. There were way to many over-zealous reviews for Dyson. No other product, even the best, gets 5 stars all the time.So I subscribed to consumer Reports online (only $4.95 and obviously worth it) and the Dyson did not have good ratings. In fact, it was #14, way below Hoover Wind Tunnel and much more expensive. There was even a blurb on how it is dangerous because it can fall on your foot. Do your research and don't do it on this sight! It's a shame that someone from the Dyson Company feels the need to do their own self promoting."
1,Bad for asthma sufferers despite claims,"The vacuum worked well, and did not aggravate my asthma while vacuuming, until I emptied the dustbin. Since then everytime I vacuum my asthma acts up. I talked with customer service many times. Finally I brought it in and they said they could find nothing wrong with it, and that was the way these bagless systems work normally."
2,Too heavy for mediocre results,"I had this vacuum for almost 4 years and I really don't recommend anyone to bear this cross. It is super heavy to handle. Also the expandable tube to vacuum the stairs is so hard to handle that I prefered to carrie the whole vacuum at every step, rather than pulling the gray ""expandable"" thing..Is not as easy as is shown in the promotional videos...Beautiful design and color but too expensive and heavy for mediocre results."
3,good but not great,I bought this vacuum with great expectations after all the 5 star ratings it has. It was very easy to put together-just snap a few pieces together and then your ready to go. I loved how all the tools are right there to use. The wand takes a little bit of getting used to. If you have stairs it would be great to use because it really does extend 17' and does not tip over!! I thought this vac worked great on the commercial type carpet at Best Buy but for pile carpet it just doesn't do as well.
3,It is Okay.,"I bought this vacuum at a great sale and figured why not. I payed under $250 for it. Even for this price I have decided not to keep it. The main reason is the noise and the weight. I have pets and as soon as I get it out they run as far from me as possible because of how loud it is. Also comparing it to our old vacuum, the old one has more options that came with it, plus it worked better on our tile and hardwood flooring. This did however pull up tons of cat fur and dirt from our carpet but to me it was just not worth the price tag to keep it for the amount of space we can use it on."
3,"Great Suction, But . . . . .","Ok, I do love the suction of the Dyson. And being able to vacuum the steps without the vacuum falling over is awesome. Now, everyone talks about the great suction and that they can't believe what they see in the canister. But is anyone concerned about the fact that 90% of what ends up in the canister is carpet fiber? The stiff beater brush of the Dyson is tearing up my carpet. The condition of my carpet has deteriorated CONSIDERABLY since buying the Dyson. It has gone from looking brand-new to the point of needed to be replaced just during the period of owning the Dyson. I would like to hear what others have to say about this."
5,I'd give it 10 stars if I could...,"I read some of the reviews posted here before purchasing the DC 07 because I wasn't convinced that any vacuum could suck up pet hair without clogging and overheating. A couple of people here mentioned multiple dogs and I thought, if it works for them, it should work for my two cats. So I bought the vacuum and spent about 3 minutes putting it together (so easy!) and made a quick pass over my carpet, which was pretty covered with cat hair. I am now divided between delight at the appearance of my carpet and disgust at the amount of dirt and dust that came out of it. Seriously, I think this is one of the greatest purchases I've made in a while, and I immediately called my mother to tell her to throw out her old, expensive canister vac and buy a Dyson. It's light and easy to use, and if you buy one you won't be disappointed."
2,Legitimate reviews,"Why are these reviews written like ads? This is not helping us interested in buying this vacuum. Obviously these reviews are by Dyson employees, why else would so many of these reviews defend their product. A normal reviewer would not try to discount other reviewers.How about everyone that really bought a Dyson vacuum, post an honest review. This is what helps everyone."
3,Excellent One Dimensional Upright Vac,"I bought this and returned.The main reason difficulty in using on board attachments.It takes few minutes to remove the spiral tube and put back in.If you both clean the carpet and remove dust from other areas at the same time, this vacuum is not good for you. Inventors did not think about quick interchangeability for the design.This is highly recommended if you only clean carpets and need a vac with a HEPA filter. There no other Vacuum below $400 come close to carpet cleaning performance.I now have a cheep Eureka Boss even though it is harder to manure since its interchangeability is quick."
4,Bill Anschell rocks the boat on this recording!!!!,"Jeff Baker presents a very unique vocal style on Monologue. There is no singer around who really resembles him, which is a great plus overall. I was so flabbergasted by the talented musicians within the Seattle area that played a vital role in this recording. Bill Anschell is soooo outstanding that mere words cannot begin to express the piano skills of such a talented man. Bill adheres to traditional jazz stylings on the usual jazz tunes while still providing fantastic deviations that are part of his expressive nature. Bill's arrangements are also noteworthy. I would recommend this work for everyone."
4,superman animated dvd box set double sided dvd & cds suck,i give this dvd box sets 1 out 4 I Hate double sided dvds i rather pay an extra 10 dollars Not to have a double sided dvd other than that terrible option through out the set its great if you superman series fan if it was not for the double sided dvd crap i would have gave the rating a 5 or more.i like looking at the art on the dvd or cd not flip ove the dvd and clean both sides of the coin if it has dust on it and it wont play because of it.
3,Too violent for 8-year-old,"Our 8-year-old daughter found this show too violent (it has guns). If your children like superheroes and are this age, try Kim Possible or Teen Titans."
3,Nothing's good after GT4,"If you've played Gran Turismo long enough, you'd probably realized there's nothing like it out there (at least for PS2). Having said this, Super Trucks has decent graphics, but the driving part needs a lot of improvement. This is not for hardcore racers."
5,'i am an alfa and omega',"For a student of the English Literature who does not happen to be in full command of the French Language, this book comes as a handy blessing: on the one hand, it is compact and thus, unlike other anthologies, you may grab it with you wherever you are. On the other, it contains poems from mid-nineteenth to mid-twentieth century: Nerval, Baudelaire, Corbiere, Verlaine, Rimbaud, Mallarme, Laforgue, Appolinaire and Valery - from twenty to forty poems by each, including _El Desdichado_, excrepts from _Les Fleurs du Mal_, _Poemes Saturnien_, _Ohpelia_ and more. Each poet merits a brief, glimpsing introduction, and a bibliography for further interest. What's more, every single poem appears both in English translation and in its original French version. Strongly recommended. Worth both a general reader's pleasure, and a student's curious toil."
1,A waste of money.,The hottest setting I could hold my hand to it and not have to worry about getting burned. It can't even iron a thin cotton t-shirt. It's horrible.
5,great value for money,"Works great. Good price.Only problem is B&D; has put an unopenable screw at the back so that even fuse blows off, it becomes useless!!"
4,Steamed and Happy About It,"I'm not a professional seamstress so I cannot give a review on that scale, but for my household this is a great little product."
5,superb,"James Dyson's great contribution to mankind - a superb, revolutionary household item. It's amazing how much it picks up - and it's quite addictive! Vacuuming is a joy with a Dyson."
2,"Yeah, it sucks...","First of all, this vacuum does have great suction. However, I found that after a few minutes of vacuuming, the cyclonic action stopped because it was clogged by cat hair. I had to empty the ""bag"" 3 times to vacuum my small apartment. It wasn't that there was a lot of cat hair, just enough to stop the air from spinning. The little cover on the very top of the handle kept getting pushed off of the opening, and was rather flimsy. It didn't make a smooth transition from floor to carpet (had to pick the thing completely up and lift it over the hump). Also, it wouldn't stay upright without something holding it up. I put it in the coat closet and when I would open the door, it would fall out toward me. Overall, I didn't think the thing was worth the exorbitant price I paid for it, and it went back to the store for a refund."
2,mine was a dud,"I just bought this vest in black from a local store today. Took the tags off and threw it in the wash, as I do with most new garments (and especially Carhartt stuff, which always needs breaking-in).When I took it out of the dryer, the inner lining had already started to disintegrate in one spot, with the insulating material showing through.I don't know if I got a faulty product or what, but I expect my workwear to hold up to a lot worse than a single wash. It's going back to the store tomorrow. This is my first disappointment from Carhartt.[Edit] I exchanged the black one for the Carhartt brown one. The brown one has been great, no problems with wear and tear. Hopefully the problem I had with the black one was just an isolated issue."
2,cheaply made and uninteresting,"Though this book is packed with information it is made cheaply, its very depressing and the writer seemed not to care whether the reader would be interested or not. I felt the book just listed things. It does have some examples of things but it can be unclear in a lot of topics. And the pages fell out just from opening and closing the book to read it."
4,Better deals than your college bookstore!!,The book arrived faster than I expected. The book was in excellent condition and was extremely cheaper than buying it from my colleges bookstore and was in stock unlike the bookstore! I made a excellent choice ordering from Amazon and will definantly do it again.
1,Arrived with broken parts/Hamster climbs out,"I was so excited to get this. We have 4 hamsters and thought this would make things a lot easier as far as interacting and when I clean the cages. Well, our youngest hamster escaped by climbing up the wall within the first 5 min of being in it and now she get out almost as quickly as I put her in. It also arrived with broken metal bars. I had to glue them back to it. This was definitely a waste of money."
4,Just What We Needed,The Contour Backmax was just what we needed for a post-surgery cushion support. It is just as pictured and described.
3,I am still perplexed!,"I expected a more historical/ecumenical presentation. The author's Christian and Biblical background predominate - which, given his background, is only natural, I suppose."
5,4 kids and 2 dogs - Couldn't ask for a better vacuum!,"I just received this vacuum last week as a birthday gift from my husband. I use to receive jewelry but now with 4 kids (3 under 5) and 2 Siberian Huskies a vacuum cleaner is more practical.We reviewed many vacuums and decided on this one. Best decision we have made in a long time. I vacuum at least 4 times a week due to the kids and dogs so I was truly amazed the first time I used the ""Animal"". The amount of hair and fine dirt it picked up was unbelievable. I thought I did a good job vacuuming - boy was I wrong. The rugs feel softer (even my husband commented on this fact). I put it together myself in 5 minutes and the attachments are easy to use (once you get use to them).This vacuum is worth the investment. The best part of all is I even get my husband to help with the vacuuming."
5,It just sucks in the BEST WAY!!!,"I purchased my Dyson last Saturday, and I have yet to put the thing away. It's just the best. Easy to put together, easy to use, and it has suction like there is no tomorrow. My condo has hardwood floors, area rugs, and two cats. The floors and rugs have never been so clean. The first time I used it, I got enough cat hair out of the rugs for a new cat! I've also noticed that there has been much less sniffling and sneazing from my husband, who is allergic to dust mites. This baby is worth every penny, and I'm extremely pleased with my purchase."
1,What the (?!?!) with the positive reviews?,"I've been a housekeeper for 15 years, and have clients who own this vacuum. When my Dirt Devil got a short, I was forced to use one of these. No suction. It's impossibly heavy, so good luck on stairs. I asked my client about it, she regrets buying it. I checked out my other clients Dyson vacuums, and it's the same story. I'm very confused by the positive reviews, everyone that I know who owns one, hates their Dyson."
2,"Picks up well, but not worth it.","Unlike others, I wasn't as thrilled with my dyson. I bought one after reading all the glowing recommendations here. I thought it picked up well, but was unhappy with the difficulty using the attachments, they were a pain to use. I was debating about whether I wanted to keep it or not, when it broke. For 500 dollars, I expect more. I would not buy another one nor do I recomend it to anyone else."
4,This vacuum cleaner sucks!,"Man, this vacuum cleaner sucks. It sucks hard core! I've never had a machine that sucked so much as this one. When I got it as a gift my first reaction was, ""a vacuum? That sucks."" But then when I gave it a go I realized that I was completely wrong. The vacuum cleaner totally sucks.Sometimes, it gets clogged up with hairs and stuff, however, which sucks because it doesn't suck. But if you clean it out, it will absolutely suck!"
3,NOT FOR HEAVY DUTY CARPET VACUUMING,"Unfortunately, all the hype on the DYSON had me hooked. I ordered the DYSON CYCLONE ANIMAL UPRIGHT VAC. I must admit it has been terrific on sucking up dirt, if using only the hose fixture. HOWEVER, if you vacuum a lot, and I mean A LOT, this is not for you. I vacuum everyday. Both hardwood and carpet. On the hardwood, it does fine. On the carpet, not good. Also, one of the features is the washable filter. It states that it should be cleaned every few months. WELL, try EVERY week. Again, if you vacuum a lot of carpeting, this is not the vacuum for you. Stick with a ROYAL!"
1,Poor Quality,We bought our Dyson two years ago. It worked well until we noticed we were tripping breakers everytime we used it due to an electrical short in the Dyson. I am not impressed. I have had cheaper products last a lot longer. These are highly over-rated.
1,Sooo Very Bad!,"I too was sucked in by the amount of wonderful feedback left for this unit! Mine worked great for about 3 months then decided it had no use of being a vaccuum any longer. I am now on my 3rd attepmt at getting this thing repaired. It has NOOOOOO SUCTION at all with the canister attached. Customer service is stumped! They refuse to refund my money or replace unit w/ a new one, they can only send unit 5000 miles across country for yet another attempt at repair. This whole process takes 3 weeks. I will never buy a Dyson product ever again. I truelly believe that I just got a bad unit, but since they refuse to refund or replace, I won't buy Dyson products. Oh yeah, and the quick release handle is not at all quick release! Its more like wrestling a 25 foot anaconda that just doesnt want to coraporate. The bare floor mode only works when you go over the dirt and then pull back again since the front lip is to close to the ground, it only drags dirt forward."
2,Plastic Parts Break,"Sorry I spent this much money on such a minimal quality machine. Yes, it has great suction, but two of the plastic attachments broke within six months of purchase. Also, this is not the vacuum for you if you have allergies, as emptying the cannister does allow dust to fly. I have to continually wash the cabinet next to the wastebasket where I empty the cannister due to the dust accumulation. And if you are used to having a vacuum with a retractable cord, not having one is a real pain. I end up looping the cord all over my body just trying to keep it out of the way. I also need to move my furniture around a lot more when I vacuum as it is so high, it does not fit underneath as many pieces of furniture as my old vacuum cleaner. I figure I'll use it another year or two to get my money's worth out of it, and then give it away. Glad I didn't throw out my old vacuum as a back up."
5,Best ever,"You will be blown away. Sucked up so much cat hair it was scary, and I vacuum every day. Inventor should get Nobel Prize. Goes from carpet to kitchen floors automatically. The perfect machine. Fasten your seat belts before using. It's not even loud."
1,Extremely Disappointed,"I purchased this vacuum 2 years ago hoping it would solve my yellow lab dog hair problem. I was horribly wrong. Initially, the flat attachment broke at the elbow joint while using on the stairs. Dyson replaced it only to have it happen again within months. Very cheap plastic design.Forget the dog hair. My old Hoover Windtunnel picks up the dog hair on one pass. The Dyson takes multiple slow passes. Don't bother with edge cleaning. It won't happen unless you use the attachments.It's far too large to vacuum under anything like the kitchen cabinets, coffee table or get close to the edge of the couch.I have experienced a lot of dust build up on the inside of the tunnel portion of the machine. I had to take the entire thing apart this summer and use another vacuum just to get all the built up dirt off the machine.For $500 I could have two Hoover Windtunnels that actually work. This machine is going off to the dump!"
2,Declining power!,"At first I was in love with this machine ... it was so funky and seemed to really suck dirt really well. But after 6-months, the love affair is over. I wish I could revive my old Bissel. The Dyson seems to be losing suction power and I realize now that it has trouble picking up any object larger than a pea. Perhaps there is some filter maintenance that I am supposed to be doing to the turbines, but how often is that expected? If that's the case, then the bagless feature is a failure.Sorry Dyson. I just things should just work properly."
1,"Cheap quality, poor service","I purchased a Dyson animal and the plastic piece holding the hose and handle to the body of the vacuum broke. They claim this is made of crash helmet material. I strongly disagree. I called Dyson and they do not have a person to service the vacuum within 100 miles of Nashville, TN. Their only suggestion was to ship the vacuum to Buffalo, NY for over $100 dollars."
5,"LOVE IT, LOVE IT, LOVE IT!!!","You cannot go wrong with this vacuum. It's has cut my cleaning time in half, greatly improved my allergies, and returnd peace between me and my pets."
2,"looses suction, terrible on stairs, difficulty w/tools",I used this about 6 times. the first time i could barely push and pull it bcs the suction was so strong. It became a lot easier as time went on bcs the vac does loose suction. I'm used to Canisters and will never get an upright again. trying to vac stairs and get the wand thingy out is very difficult. I don't think this Vac is user friendly and its definetly not worth the price. i returned it to target.
3,Spanier,"A good album with very good sound. The performances are all good and the clarity and mastering are both exellent. This is a good introduction to Mugsy Spanier, especially to anyone who does not have his famous 1939 sides on RCA."
2,Not even passable,"For a Gospel book of His Word, it's not worth a bumper, but not a bad movie as movies go these days I suppose; John 3:16 wasn't even mentioned, and that in itself is downright DISGRACEFUL! And that's only the tip of the errors!"
1,Not-so-good printer,"I bought this mainly for Direct DVD/CD printing.I was curious about their ""claria"" ink that says smudge resistant, water-resistant.I tried printing a page in a website and dipped the printed paper in water...the ink fade and start ""bleeding"". Same thing with dvd/cds. This claria cannot be compare to the epson's ""dura-brite"" ink.I owned an Epson C80 that uses dura-brite ink and this was really water-resistant. One more thing, Epson R260 is a ""loud"" machine!"
2,Price drop 30 days after it came out,"I bought this from Amazon 35 days ago and I should have waited. The price dropped less than a few weeks after it was delivered. The ink smears if it gets wet, even after drying for several days and the ink is expensive, impossible to find. I bought this printer to print directly on cd's,dvd's etc, It does an OK job on the direct to disk printing but I am less than thrilled with the amount of ink that it uses. I should have waited for the reviews from Amazon customers which usually are pretty honestly written. First purchase from Amazon that I am sorry about.added info 12/10/06 -Price dropped again. pretty soon it will be free. 53.00 drop in less than 60 days. makes me feel like a sucker! Where did I put my polaroid camera?"
3,"Ok, but not ink friendly","I bought this expressly for printing on CDs. It works well and produces a nice-looking end product, but the ink cartridge longevity (as noted in many other reviews) is utterly pitiful. In addition, since it doesn't use black, magenta, blue, yellow like most printers, you can't refill these cartridges with a do-it-yourself kit. Seems like this printer was designed with ink sales in mind more than anything else.I probably won't buy another Epson if/when this one dies out."
4,Worked fine for a while.,After a couple years and occasional use it up and died. It was cheep and I really only got it for the CD printing that I don't do anymore anyway.
1,print quality,"If the cost of the print cartridges is not enough to avoid this printer then the poor print quality should. I am on my second printer and cannot get the small strips from my prints. After spending hours with tech support, this R260 is heading to a landfill! It's not worth my time to trouble shoot a defective manufacture."
1,Wouldn't work for cds,"Junk, Cd printer doesn't function. I got this printer to print on cds a couple of years ago and never opened the box. When I recently went to set it up everything worked fine for printing on paper, except the cd load mechanism wouldn't work and a ""print tray position error"" came up as soon as the lever for printing on cd's was engaged. No longer under warranty, tech support admitted it was a hardware malfunction and suggested I could buy another one through their discounted ""epson loyalty"" program. Yeah, right. If you get one check it out immediately, apparently Epson's quality control is lacking."
3,"Great prints, but it IS an ink drinkin' cartridge chomping printer","I got this solely to print custom CDs for a new business project and while the CDs look fabulous, I am shocked at how FAST I go through the cartridges. Yes, I read the other reviews and thought that it could NOT be as bad as they made it sound. Guess what? It is! If quality is important and cost is very secondary...go ahead and get this printer. But if you do not have lots of extra cartridge money lying around, keep shopping. I had to up my prices on customizing CDs to make even a few cents!I like Epson printers and have had many over the years and this is the first time I have not been able to give a BIG thumbs up. I am giving it three stars because the CDs look great, but the ink consumption is way more than expected. I would give 5 stars for quality of product and 0 stars for cartridge use, so I averaged it to 3."
3,Trouble with B&W photo printing,"Overall, the printer is good. Color printing is excellent, the speed and noise are good, but printing a black & white photo has been a problem. It is more sepia than true B&W. I removed all color from the picture using Photoshop and made sure the printer properties were set properly. I tried several different setting in printer properties, but the picture had the same sepia tint to it each time. Aside from B&W print problem I'm pleased with the performance of the printer."
1,I can build a better printer out of peanut butter and cheese doodles.,"On my way to the trash to throw this printer away, I thought to myself ""I should write an amazon review to warn people about this thing.""Please only consider buying this printer if you enjoy printing 25 pages of black text only to have the printer halt mid-job and demand you replace the Cyan ink cartridge before continuing.This is the 3rd budget Epson printer I have owned, and fool me once, twice, three times... now I'm just going to buy an HP Laser jet. Spending $250 on a printer to then spend $100/month on ink just doesn't work out in a recession economy."
4,Little People House,My son is 18 months old and is starting to play with this. I think the house is a good way to get them to use their imagination and use free play.[...].
3,doll house,"Bought this for my daughter but she never really played with it like I thought she would. My son who is 18 months loves the mechanics of it though. Once he was old enough to explore the house he checked it over and over and over again. Doesn't care what should go where he just wants to find the doorbell, slide the window back and forth and move the cat/dog."
4,"Fun music, skilled musicians","As another reviewer said, this probably is ""tourist music,"" but it's very fun & seems to be mostly authentic Greek folk music, on appropriate instruments. (Except for the last track, where they suddenly bring in a disco beat -- hello??) I only wish these guys wouldn't try to sing -- none of them really has a good voice, though they can carry a tune just fine. To me, it sounds as if the bazouki players are doing double-duty, but I think they should have hired some real singers! Anyhow, all that said, this is a real toe-tapping, fun album & the instrumental playing is great. Several of the tracks are live, and it's overall very worth the money."
4,"Read it, if you are not sure of winning a lottery !","OK, it is much about common sense but then common sense is not really that common. Is it? Tom has captured many ideas which should become a part of your life. And, who knows, incorporation of these principles into your daily life may really make you wealthy. An excellent book, I heartily recommend it."
4,3 or 4 of the best 1960's Tunes!,"I still have the original LP FEVER TREE from 1967, and those tunes comprise most of the first 10 songs here. Given that this is a practically unknown album and band, some of these orchestral based songs are as timeless as you can get for the music of that era! Listen to UNLOCK MY DOOR, COME WITH ME, SUN ALSO RISES, and FILIGREE AND SHADOW (before this song turns into a loud psychedelic blaster). One would be hard put to find such a fine group of folky, lavishly done songs from any era. Even the lyrics are miles above most of the silliness from that era. And strong vocals to boot! Much of the rest is second rate, which is why I only give 4, and not 5 stars. Still a near masterful CD which easily stands the test of time!"
1,Not For Anxiety,"I ordered this product to help with Anxiety and rough nerves. I was getting over a stomach issue and was told that I should not take any medication or antibiotics as it would worsen my situation but that natural herbs or extracts were fine, that's why I thought I would give this a try. I started with one pill in the morning and one pill at night and it had no effect on me. I upped the amount to two pills in the morning two in afternoon two at night, still no results for me. I didn't get any calming feeling or relief from my on edge feelings. It didn't help me sleep at night. It didn't give me any bad side effects but no positive results either. I took this product for one month with no results. I wouldn't recommend this product for people that have been diagnosed with anxiety. Maybe it works better for those who are just stressed out or feeling a once in a while anxiousness like before a meeting or test, but definitely not for the everyday anxiety sufferers."
3,Super Reader,"This is a competent job, but the fault here lies with the plot that is adapated. So, much like the movie the best part is clearly the worm bit. Having two of your three best characters out of it, and one not even appearing is not such a great idea.The Worm guys and the hyperspace car are cool though."
2,Great Material in a Dated Package,"Contagious Christian materials are one of the best resources available to equip normal Christians to reach their world. Unfortunately, this youth edition is dated in its style.Great material that needs an update."
4,Does the Job; Classic Looks!,I have been a Fender-Playing musician since I was about sixteen (24 now). I love the tone of Fender Amplifiers and the classic good looks that come with them. This cover matches the size and classic looks perfectly.
4,Has it all...but,"This book doesnt miss anything as far as teardown and rebuild. The book is also jammed with pictures.The only thing missing is hop-up advice ,tips and tricks"
2,Liberal view of Indian Identity,I found the book quite good and interesting but do not agree with Amartya Sen's politics. He is at pains to show the BJP and family in poor light. One wonders why. Now make no mistake I am no far right supporter myself but I would prefer to be liberal without losing your self respect. Otherwise the book highlights some very important points which every Indian should read and internalize. Its good intellectual stuff provided you don't get carried away by Sen's politics.
1,What nonsense,"Let's start off with the book. I started reading with an open mind and found the first essay to be rather humorous and actually enjoyed it, but that was it. His criticism of the subaltern school seemed little more than apologist rhetoric and his ""analysis"" of Gandhi lacked any true understanding of the man. I found that often he attributed to Gandhi exactly what the Mahatma contradicted. At times I felt that he took the opposing voice to the subalterns simply because he was elite enough to do it, he seemed to lack any rationale or detailed understanding of their work. The nobel prize is the only reason why this book made it to where it is and well frankly it does help to have a wife with connections pretty far up in the chain does it not? Dr Sen, sir, stick to economics, historical/cultural analysis is not your forte."
3,same exact info on website,I bought this book because I like princeton review in general. It turns out that you can get the same exact info off of their website by looking up the school. Save your money and go to their website or buy another book.
5,too much fun,"I hate scooby doo and this game rocks! Takes forever to beat, which is good. good for kids 5+. Like 50 levels and 20 monsters.get the game."
4,Excellent novel--only complaint is it's getting too serial,"Emma Merrigan is a 40-something in not the most glamourous of occupations. By day, she's a librarian. As she sleeps, she goes into the Never-never and moots curses. In this book, she's trying to sort out a curse that's followed a family for several generations. Sadly, she doesn't really answer how this is going to happen and leaves us hanging. I very much enjoyed the book, but I would have preferred some resolution for this one rather than having to wait til the next episode."
5,NEW SPIRIT FILLED LIFE BIBLE BY JACK W. HAYFORD,IT IS THE BEST. I USE A LOT OF DIFFERENT BIBLES WHEN STUDYING BUT I ALWAYS USE NEW SPIRIT FILLED LIFE BIBLE BY JACK W. HAYFORD THE MOST. IT HAS LOTS OF HELPS AND CAN EXPLAIN THE SCRIPTURES GREAT.
5,Awesome Study Bible,"An awesome Study Bible. The Word Wealth notations are especially fun for me, a self-proclaimed ""word-a-phile"". Enjoying this Bible daily."
3,New Spirit Filled Life Bible,I can not figure out how to go places when I am in church and want to see the scripture that the pastor is talking about.
4,Rev. J's Review,The first bible I received had the chapters out of order. I called the company and the experience was great. They displays a positive response to a negative situation.My bible was replaced and the person on the phone displayed a pleasant and cheerful disposition.
5,Very Good Investment,"I had an older New Spirit-Filled Life Bible & after much use invested in another one. This bible helps me to better comprehend some passages & has a lot of extra information at your fingertips. The word wealth is an extra added amount of information formulated to break down a word for better clarification. I also find very useful the scripture references, concordance, and the notes added to be able to understand some of the scriptures more easily. A very good investment & the cover design is very nice. If you like a New King James version you will really like this one."
4,Great Bible,"My favorite bible used to be the NIV study bible, but for some reason I have a hard time reading the print style. The large print edition is like carrying around a cement block so I was looking for another study bible. This has all the features I like and the printing is easy on the eyes even though I have to wear glasses with anything I read...for some reason the print is easier to read. I love the Word Wealth and the introductions...and most all of the info that comes with this. I love the binding, I bought the genuine leather, and it's very sturdy and well made. I also bought the thumb indexed and really like that feature. It's not too big either. The only thing I don't like as much as the NIV Study are the study notes. Almost everytime i want some additional info and look at the notes, the verse I want more info on isn't covered. The NIV has alot of great, objective info and I would say these study notes are okay, just not as good."
5,"Comprehensive, definitive survey of Irish-American history.","This weighty volume will appeal to holdings with strong Irish history interests: it is compiled by a panel of scholars drawn from various nations and details the Irish people in Ireland and America. The inclusion of listings by state and area allows students to narrow their studies to local Irish history, while the listings include notable individuals, events, and social and religious topics affecting the Irish. A comprehensive and important addition to any serious Irish history collection."
2,Something Funny Going On,"This is an ""enhanced"" CD, which I'm not sure I know exactly what that means. However, I do know that it did not play when I put it in my computer's CD Rom drive. Instead, I got a message that I needed to install Quicktime. After attempting to install it, it still refused to play, telling me again that Quicktime was not installed. Perhaps I am not a patient man, but I ended up throwing the CD away--it just seems not worth the trouble. As far as the music and price goes I have no quibble. Judy is a wonderful performer, and this appears to be a good selection."
5,Earle is King,"I am a huge fan of Steve Earle's music, mainly because the songs he writes are incredibly poignant and stirring. These stories will delight all of the fans of his music, the people who love him for his political passions, and anyone who likes a good story. The story ""The Red Suitcase"" is my favorite, although I enjoyed them all. It was great to read ""Taneytown""- the story behind the awesone song on the CD El Corazon. He writes gritty tales that reminded me of some of the great storytellers I can't wait to hear Steve Earle read from this collection."
2,Disappointed,I wanted something like this so that I could learn Armenian by hearing how the Armenian words were spoken.Not so! When are you going to create one of these artclesfor Americans so that we Americans can hear-learn Armenian?
1,What a terrible disappointment!!!,"I've just got this player last friday. I must say that I was quite happy with the way it sounds but, after just five days of very light use (I hardly played more than 15 CDs since friday) it's already refusing to work properly! It just wont play discs that my 15 year old Sony CD-player had no trouble playing!I read some alarming reviews about the former version of this model but I was confident that the mechanical bugs described in those reviews had been fixed on this newer version! Apparently I was wrong!!!Last night I wrote a review about the wonders of the Harman Kardon receiver (HK-3480) that I bought along this CD-player. I guess that Harman Kardon still has a lot of homework to do with their CD-players!I'll ask for my money back and will start looking again for a decent CD-player!!!"
1,I wish I read these reviews before I bought this piece of garbage!,"Since the early 80's, I've drooled at the sight of Harmon Kardon's products, wishing I had thousands to blow on their super high-end gear. Then I see I can buy their CD changer for under $200! It can't be bad because it's an HK, right? WRONG!!!Every problem stated in these reviews happened to me within the first few minutes: horrible grinding sounds and clicks you haven't heard the likes of since you rode your Schwinn in 3rd grade, not reading disks, buttons not responding, the tray jammed shut with your CD's trapped inside, looooooooong waits for it to start playing when it actually did.I thought I must have gotten a repackaged used one and thought my retailer was the bad guy. I almost asked for a replacement instead of a refund. But reading these reviews confirmns that HK is the bad guy.P.S. The sound (if you ignore the egg timer trapped in the unit) is fine but nothing to write home about."
3,Refurbished times 3,"In fairness to Harman Kardon, I purchased a refurbished model. They did agreeably replace the first two changers which would hang up in the middle of a CD. The third one is a charm. I seek only to play 5 CD's from beginning to end rather than pick and choose from several. Therefore the electronic extras are simply features that could cause future problems. Now that I have a working model, I find that the sound is excellent. I play home-burned CD's from vinyl records and experience no degradation in sound. My faith in HK has been restored."
3,Disappointed,"I ordered this CD player to go along with my HK receiver.Given the company reputation, I did not reviews from other customers.The first time I used it I had trouble retrieving one on my CDs.I played with the button on the front and it finally came round.Now that I have the knack, everything seems alright. But I remain a little anxious.But it does look good and the price was right.....It is 3 months later and the CD's are not always playing.I often have to fiddle with the contols for 5 minutes to get it to play.I wish I could downgrade the stars to one and a half"
4,"Some minor annoyances, but good overall.","I have found that the problem of the FL8385 not reading CD's (CD-R's in particular) can be easily remedied if you push the stop button after closing the CD tray.Problems occur when the unit tries to start playing the CD immediately upon closing the tray. For some reason or another it can't read the CD, and thus assumes no disc is present. By simply pushing the stop button, however, it gives the laser time to read the CD...then once the CD information (i.e., track #'s) is displayed on the screen, push play. Problem solved.Granted it takes a few extra seconds before you can start the music, but come on, its only a few seconds at most. You can spare it.Besides this issue, I have no real complaints."
2,This one could make you wanna go straight,"I agree with another reviewer when they wrote 'The only reason I even gave it 2 stars, is because it has ""lesbian"" anything in it...' I watched it with a friend and we both found it a totally depressing watch. Most the story lines are so negative that it makes you wonder if you should go straight. And the ones left over are killed by the dire production values. In what could be seen as a less than community minded act, after one watch I put it straight onto out local online auction site as i couldn't even be bothered having it my lesbian DVD collection its so annoying."
4,Cute book - My Son LOVES it!,"This book is great- Luna lights up, which my son loves. My only complaint about the book is it isn't very long. Overall- it makes my 3 yr old happy which is all that matters. We just read the book a couple times in a row and he is ready for bed! He likes to spin Luna in the dark. Luna is his favorite character and we jumped at the chance to buy a book especially about her."
5,Essential book for Economy Cookery,"I have owned several copies of this book. It is a big help when using up leftovers and in budget cooking. Say you have eggs, bacon and pasta. It gives you a recipe. Leftover chicken-it gives you a recipe. Down to eggs-it makes suggestions. Leftover rye bread-it gives you a recipe. Organized by ingredients, it can save you money. It does not use very pricey ingredients and it does give you options on many recipes. It also has menu suggestions. Vegetarians will probably not find useful. Give it a try."
5,This game Rocks!,this is a great game. if you're looking for a realistic flight sim then you probably won't like this game. the controls are very simple and easy to learn. someone who reviewed said that they couldn't save their game. i don't know what they're talking about though. maybe they have a problem with their memory card. anyways this is a great game if you're just looking for a fun time... if you're looking for a realistic game this is not it. (you can even get a tie fightere and x-wing if you beat the game)
4,Great Game,"If you are a WWII Fan and new into games, you will enjoy this one, a little bit old but still very rewarding, you fly missions in Europe, the Pacific Ocean and over the snow covered Stalingrad among othersI still haven't seen any reviews mention that for Star Wars Fans this game has a big surprise once you succesfully achieve all missions"
5,"If you Love WWII Planes and History, this ones for you.","The Battle Hawks, Flying Tigers, Sceamin' Eagles, Zeks, Betties, 190's! If you know your WWII planes and history this game is very fun. Well put together and tons of fun missions. A game more for the adult than kids due to the complexity of the gaming and story line.I love it!"
5,The tracks are popular...so?,"Since the tracks are popular, they *must* be bad tracks. At least that seems to be the logic of some people on here.If you're looking for obscure stuff for the sake of obscurity, then this disc is not for you.If you listen to music because of how it sounds (crazy concept, eh?) rather than whether other people like it, then this is a good trance compilation."
3,good try,First six songs are exelent but then the cd gets to cheesy for my licking. If the album did not get cheesy on the 7th song it would be a five star album.
5,A unique collection of trance songs,"This CD is one of my all-time favorites. There isn't a dull song anywhere on the whole thing, and when I put it in my CD player, I have to listen to the entire thing. It's a lot like Paul Oakenfold's 'Tranceport'; each song is unique. It had a strong beginning and an equally strong end; 'Out of the Blue' is a perfect song to close with. I will always love this CD and I recommend it to anybody looking for trance music with a lot of energy and heavy bass."
5,VERY TIGHT,This cd has the best of tracks on it. First it starts off with XPANDER by SASHA! then it kicks it with STARGAZER by DEEPSKY then just a little later it slows down to 9PM (till I come) by ATB then it busts into my favorite song which is CARTE BLANCHE by VERACOCHA. So yes this cd is pretty tight. Also pick up GATECRASHER-it will blow you away.
4,interesting,"this book is pretty sweet. i needed it for a class and history usually bores me. this book is pretty concise, and has some really interesting parts. i recommend it."
5,I built this boat!,"I would, with out hesitation, recommend this book. Mac does a very good job of relating all the information needed to build this head-turning canoe. Although I built this canoe in just five weeks, Mac provides encouragement and inspiration along the way to keep your motivation high to the end. I built the 12 foot Wee Lassie and have been in that canoe many, many times in the past two years (and caught many fish in her, too!)The only ""hard"" part of the process was ripping, beading and coving the strips. The actual boatbuilding part was a pleasure. Build one and you'll be yearning to build another... I am!..."
4,"Great Product, Bad Price","Buy this sauce, it's perfect for ice cream and moca's. But, buy it directly from DaVinci, it's $11.95 and I just bought two 1/2h gallons and was only charged $5.00 for S&H."
4,Both sides of tape are WHITE,"Got this item and am pleased. However, description is incorrect (at least for the one I was sent). Both sides of tape are WHITE unlike description. One side is White with ft/inch markings and other side is also white but with meter/centimeter markings. Yellow tape on metric side would have been nice to quickly distinguish between marking systems, but this will still serve my purposes."
4,Book review,I received product as promised. I got the book when it was needed. Price was fair. Website easy to use and purchased without issues.
1,DO NOT BUY!!!!,"Do not buy this item. I purchased this item thinking that i could give it as a gift. When this item arrived and i opened the blue suede pouch, i could not find the chain. I was about to send amazon an e mail when i decided to check the pouch again. Inside the pouch is a small pocket were the chain was hidden (and YES, this chain is so small that it was hidden well!!!!!) the pendant is about 1/4 the size of a skittles!!!(and i don't mean in thickness), and the chain is as thin as nylon thread if not thinner. You will need an magnifying glass to see this teddy bear pendant, far less to see the fur on this pendant. This is the first time i have ever rated an item 1 star, and this is by far the worst product i have ever purchased from amazon. NOT RECOMMENDED!!!!!"
2,Does not fit most cars,The main problem I have with this item is that the list of vehicles for which it works is only given on the packaging (and not here on the website). I thought it would certainly fit my 2010 golf (given that it is a compact car) but it does not! Otherwise it would have been fine.
1,Way Too Small For Most Cars,I was buying this sunshade to replace one for my 2000 300m and I saw some listed a JUMBO so I decided to order this one it turned out to be way to small for my car so I gave it to a co-worker for her new Honda Civic and again way too small - I don't what car this is suppose to fit ??? Maybe a Hot Wheels.
4,sun screen,"Covers the inside of the vehicle nicely. Difficult to use on the side windows, but we have figured out how to do it."
3,Middle of the line product,"The product works ok- it was relatively inexpensive and has held up fine since I purchased it ~2 months ago. My car spends all day while I'm at work sitting in direct sunlight where it's probably high-70's most days. This product is pretty thin so it does not cool the car as much as the label claims- but it is a trade off because it is much less bulky than the other products I considered. The thickness is not much more than a bedsheet - great for folding, only ok for keeping the car cool."
2,DOESNT FIT AN FJ CRUISER,"In the pictures it has a list of automobiles that the Jumbo size fits. I made my purchase based on that. Simply put, it does not fit an FJ Cruiser, not even close.Otherwise it is a standard fold up shade and is otherwise fine for other cars."
3,Too small for my 2011 Hyundai Elantra,"This shade was too small for the front windshield of a 2011 Hyundai Elantra, but it works for covering some of the upholstery in the rear window area. Good enough.The shade came with a compatibility list. If anybody is interested, please leave a comment and I'll type it up here."
1,Melted... thermometer,"I bought this recently and used it for deep frying, once. After being clipped on the side of the pan for 15 minutes at 375 degrees, the face melted and gooed onto my stove. Who makes a thermometer dial face out of plastic, and even worse... plastic that can't stand the heat near what it is measuring?? What a piece of junk."
3,bigger is better,"The model is smaller then the box it comes in. This is my first and last time of ordering a small model like this. When it arrived the box was dented, but the package inside was just fine."
4,no nonsense dirty fighting,"It's a book mainly focus on fighting techniques. It should have more information on how to prevent a violent situation and on verbal self-defense, but Kathy is a Martial Artist. It's great to learn phisical self defense specially dirty moves but you should be consider complementary reading after reading a more general book.About the moves, they are simple and very effective and many are design to work only against men. Yes, testicles are the number one target, and depicts many ways to exploit that weak spot even with pictures.So, highly recomended, specially for women who had a mother like mine who used to said that a lady never hits a man ""down there"", but really wants to learn how to beat a man."
4,"Good, but not great.","It's a good bottle overall, nice big spout which is good for ferrets, and I really like the sold clip and lock that is used to attach the bottle to the cage. It is solid, can't be knocked down, and the bottle un-clips easily from the bracket to make refilling easy. I didn't give the bottle 5 stars because there is drippage. Not a lot mind you, but whenever you fill it, even if you squeeze it etc it drips for a few minutes. After that it is great though, you won't have to keep cleaning up spills. There are a few better bottles out there, but I settled for this one because it was available at a local pet supply store. Overall though, it is a good bottle and I don't regret buying it."
1,Broke quickly,"First off, this bottle was basically the same as the item described, but it did look different. I suppose it was a ""new look"" and the photo didn't get updated. Just an FYI.Moving on to the important stuff... This bottle developed a leak within the first month of use. It now only takes a few minutes for all the water to drip out. I'm going to have to buy a different one."
3,The first one was better.,"Personally, I was not impressed by this book. I loved the first one and have kept an eye out for this one since it was published, but I found the writing style to be typical, almost awkward. The plot of the first one was so good that this can be overlooked - this one was a bit slower. The only thing it has going for it is that it's original. I really applaud Brennan for her female protagonists. It's about time somebody's characters stopped wearing skirts. (But she still had to put one of those scenes in there where the guy catches the girl committing a crime and tries to arrange a little quid pro quo, if you know what I mean. I swear, that's probably one of the most common fantasy scenes out there.)Also, I didn't like how the author switched POV so often. The first book was entirely from Rilsin's POV; this one would switch several times within a single scene. Very unsettling, and as a result we never get to know the new characters well enough to like.Sola's awesome."
2,poor translation,"Adorno's Philosophy of New Music gets five stars. This translation gets two stars. It's notoriously unreliable and full of errors. Instead, buy Robert Hullot-Kentor's translation titled, ""Philosophy of New Music"" (he explains why this is the correct translation of the title rather than *Modern* music.) That edition is far superior with an amazing introduction provided by the always perceptive Hullot-Kentor. Read Adorno as he was meant to be read. Don't buy this translation."
2,Plot fizzles,"Painfully long. I read this long compilation and was disappointed. If one divides the book into it's original three books, I would have stopped after ' the way through the 1st book (or 150 pages into this compliation as it started to seriously drag and become dull). The characters and storyline simply go on a tangent and the fighting between the different factions of the Inquisition do not become apparent or lead anywhere. The whole main storyline remains unresolved. The series is very unfulfilling. I did not feel any sympathy towards the main character and the secondary characters felt more like a cartoon from a D&D; campaign rather than a Warhammer 40k genre.This is not at the same quality of Dan Abnett, Ben Counter, or William King. They provide excellent fast paced storylines, vivid characters, and engage the reader.Unfortunately, this book (or rather series) was disappointing."
4,"Good, solid Brahms","Both the orchestra and conductor here are not at all famous here in the USA. However, the performances are quite solid. The symphony is played in the traditional manner with moderate tempos and a big sound. The last three movements are really impressive. Had the first movement had a tad more momentum, the rating would have been 5 stars. Both overtures receive beautiful performances."
5,POR 15 Cycle Tank Repair Kit,Excellent product. Does exactly what it's designed to.Take your time and follow the instructions. I would recommend this product and use it again.
4,Fossil Leather Handbag- Calypso Design,"This is a medium sized leather handbag by Fossil. There is plenty of room inside with two small pockets on one side for a cell phone or other such small items. On the other side is a zippered compartment. It has about an 11- 12 inch drop from the shoulder, which is nice, and a zippered closure on top. The inside is lined with a nice silky fabric with the Fossil logo on it.The one thing I don't like about this purse is the background color. It looks white or cream in most pictures, which is why I bought it. But it is actually a dark tan or beige. I loved the different colored paisley and butterflies that adorn this bag, but they really lose something on the darker background. (This, of course, is just my opinion.)All in all this is a nice bag. I would reccomend it for anyone who likes unusual looking leather purses."
3,Falls short,"I bought this thermometer to track the progress of homemade yogurt. The mechanism that hooks the thermometer to the pan is great but the thermometer, when compared with two others that do not attach to a pot or pan, was inaccurte. It may have other uses, so I'll persist but as far as the purpose for which it was purchased, it fell sadly short of expectations."
2,"after four uses, switch won't turn on with 5 or 6 tries","Great little light, but the switch has stopped working already. I have to try at least 5 or 6 times before it will turn on. Very disappointing. I should send it back, but I just had surgery and when it works, I use it. When it starts taking 20 tries or stops turn on altogether, I'll hope I still have my paperwork to send it back."
3,sticky switch,"The plus, Its a great booklight. It lights up everything I need to see. The switch is sticky which gets very frustrating. i never know if it will go on, althought after hitting it or shaking the switch it does go on."
3,Lack of interest from manafacturer.,"This booklight is good but the batteries do not last. Supposed to be 15 hours but they do not last nearly that long. I have had the booklight for less than a month and have had to replace the batteries twice. I contacted the address given in the instruction phamplet inquiring about a local address of a store where the adaptor can be purchased or to order an adaptor from them and they have not bothered to reply. The phamplet suggested contacting the ""dealer"" which in my case is Amazon and of course they don't have such an item or did not suggest another alternative."
3,Disappointing product,"This light put out a nice, even light when it worked. It rarely worked reliably though. The other posters were very accurate when they said that the light would not come on immediately. Sometimes, it would take 5 mins or more before the fluorescent tube would light. I have had it for about a year now and although the light it produces is the best I have seen for reading in the dark, the light is also the most frustrating I have used. Really, it is the most expensive book light I have ever owned and also the least reliable. Now it will only light if I position it so that it does not shine on the page. Useless. Steer clear of this one and go for an led model."
3,Terrific light...when it lights,"After reading so many glowing reviews for this light (pardon the pun) and having been generally dissapointed with all the other lights I've tried, I forked over what's a fair amount of money for a reading light and bought the Phorm. The other reviews are right: I find the batteries last much longer than other lights and the flourescent bulb itself casts more than enough light by which to read yet doesn't bleed over to the other side of the bed and keep others awake. I haven't had any trouble with the clip on either hardcovers or paperbacks.The one problem I have is that there seems to be a problem with either the switch or the bulb, because it can take as many as twenty attempts to turn on sometimes. I understand the delay in lighting (only a second or two because it's flourescent) but not turning on at all makes it kind of useless. When it works, it's a five-star+ light; when it doesn't, it's very frustrating."
1,defective,"This expensive book light would never completely close (would ""pop"" open)and ceased to work a few days after received."
1,Arrived Broken,This unit arrived broken. I've had another one that didn't last very long. I would not recommend it to anyone.
2,Pretty awful!,"Don't waste your money unless you just feel like throwing some away just for the fun of it and have some time to spare watching a waste of time film. This film would only be beneficial to a virgin couple who knows little to nothing on trying to please each other. It's boring with way way too much talking and explaining by the doctors or the couples themselves. It's a very short film in the first place with more of watching everybody talk than anything. You do get little excerpts of what is supposed to be sexual demonstration by regular couples, but they talk a whole lot too and the sex scenes that follow are boring. Old couples trying to give oral, etc., and other couples who just seem hard up., again not worth it if you're hoping for anything exciting or stimulating in the least."
2,Silver Computer Lamp,Product arrived well packaged and in a timely fashion. The overall durability of the lamp left something to be desired. The bulb burned out within the first 9 months and there is no way to replace it.Disappointed with its overall longevity and durability.
1,think twice!,"I just received this thermometer in the mail today, and carefully removed it from it's packaging. Upon taking the thermometer out, I was holding it and looking at it & was stunned when I just barely tapped it and the glass broke! Will buy another brand and hope for better luck next time."
2,Fading numbers,"This is a great thermometer... for the first few months. After that, the numbers started to fade. I can't even tell where the numbers even used to on my thermomter."
2,Not recommended,I agree with the other reviewer. This is NOT a candy thermometer. Is really a waste. Do not recommend that you buy it.
4,Top Flite Film Noir,Great viewing. Dick Powell goes from crooner to hard boiled privare dick. He's much better as a private dick. Good supporting cast Mike Mazurki is perfect.Otto Kruger is evil itself. film noir at its best.
3,BORGIAS REVIEW,WAS NOT PAYING ATTENTION WHEN I PURCHASED AND DID NOT REALIZE THAT I HAD ORDERED A VHS TAPE. CONDITION WAS OK.
2,Not the best,"Granted I did buy this cd 10 years after its release, I still thought it would be betr than this. I only like 4 tracks on the entire cd"
5,let the sex come down,"i had been looking for this album for the longest. my man link is a real freak. if you lookin to have a good time with that special someone this album will definetly get you in the mood. ""gimmie some"" and ""sex down"" are 2 of the hottest songs on there. no matter how mad you are at your mate pop this cd in and it's on and poppin!!!!"
3,"The good, and the not so good.","Lindsey Buckingham may be one of the greatest guitarists in rock music today but his songwriting abilities leave much to be desired. Other than ""Peacekeeper"" and the opener ""What's The World Coming To"" his other contributions border on the bizarre. Stevie Nicks has never sounded better, especially on the best track on the album ""Thrown Down"" but Christine McVie is certainly missed. If one eliminates 6 or 7 songs from the album (76 minutes in length) you have a mighty fine effort. As it is, the results are much too uneven to give it a hearty endorsement."
2,Won't work in a computer,"Sorry, but my comment is not about the content of the album. I bought this and put it into my computer, which I use as my stereo. Won't play. Thanks to the great thinking of the record company, they only way I can listen to this is by downloading the ""illegal"" bootlegs off the internet. Beware--if you use your computer to play music while you work, this CD is useless."
3,It's growing on me...,"I am a LONG-TIME FM fan and absolutely adore Stevie, so I am not pulling a Micheal Moore...The first time I heard the CD, I really did not like it at all. I was very disappointed, and the only song that stood out was Good-Bye Baby by Stevie at the end.However, I listened to it again today and admit some songs are growing on me alot (Miranda, Running through the GArden, Silver Girl, Bleed to Love her). I was disappointed with Ilume. Stevie's voice is SOO DEEP on this one.I hope the concert contains more older than newer."
1,"""Say you will"" wont do it for me.","I hav learned to read reviews closely and, in this instance, to know Chris McVie was not participating, turned me off. She became an integral part of Mac and I enjoy albums more when she was aboard.CheersBoris"
4,Classic Fleetwood (But I miss Christine),"Okay Guys (and gals)...any of you familiar with Fleetwood Mac's work during and through the Buckingham / Nicks era will be psyched to hear this album. It's chock full of the two of them. But, I still miss Christine. Her songs were usually peppered into the albums like a rare spice that was refreshing after Lindsey and Stevie had their way with you musically.That said, the album is fantastic in a ( ""Oh God, they still have it"" kind of way). The ""Say You Will"" album is like Tusk minus La McVie. But it's shorter (slightly...) and still a great ""roll down the windows / or open the house up and blast the stereo"" kind of way...plenty to sing along to and plenty to make you think that in her lyrics...Stevie might just know your story too..."
4,GREAT,"Ok, after listening to this CD numerous times, I have changed my review and give it 4 stars instead of 3 stars. I still feel that a few of the songs are just ok, but most of the songs on here are great and a few are already classics. Yes, it does sound a little like two solo albums thrown together on one CD but if you like Lindsey and Stevie then who cares? How can you not like the guitar solos in ""Murrow... and ""Come"", as well as Stevie's beautiful ""Illume"" and the very cute and catchy ""Say You Will"". Other standouts for me are ""What's the World Coming To"", ""Thrown Down"", ""Red Rover"", ""Silver Girl"" and ""Steal Your Heart Away"". Thanks FM for a great CD, it took you long enough!"
3,"Average Album from ""The Mac"",","This new album from Fleetwood Mac is quite listenable but there are many songs on this album that should have not have been included or used on this album. Highlights on the Album include, ""Say You Will"", ""Thrown Down"", ""Steal Your Heart Away"", ""Peacekeeper"", ""Miranda"" and ""Bleed to Love Her"". However strange Buckingham songs such as ""Red Rover and ""Come"" put this album down. Also the Nicks tunes, ""Smile at You"", ""Running Through the Garden"", ""Silver Girl"", and ""Everyone Finds Out are very average songs and are nothing more than ""fillers"". This album is an ok effort from a band that lost a major member, Christine McVie to retirement but her voice and songwriting could have helped this album."
1,What a mess,"Please, Say You Won't ever release another album. This is a great example of what happens when a band gets too popular and stops listening to the people that can tell them what will make an album sell. So many of these songs had the potential to be excellent but they're buried under a ton of effects, over-engineering, monotonous guitar leads and just plain stupid themes. You could re-edit this CD, cut out about 6-7 songs, simplify the rest and you might have a pretty good album. Otherwise, it just a self indulgent waste of time. I was really looking forward to this, but I'm afraid it's going in the drawer."
4,Missing Cristine McVie,"I think this special edition is a little pricey. For the extra 10 dollars it cost to get this special edition, you get fancy packaging and a 4 song ""bonus"" cd. The cd is also enhanced (which I can't even use). I think this band sorely misses Christine McVie as I know I did. I think she adds a centering and sensible quality to her songs which the other two singers definitely lack. Lynsay Buckingham's song craftsmanship and guitar paying are excellent as usual. I love the song piecemaker which utilizes both Lynsay Buckinham's and Stevie Nick's vocals. I also liked several of Stevie Nick's songs like ""throw down"" and ""say you will"". Lyndsay Buckinghams songs as well as many of Stevie Nick's are kind of out there. They don't seem to be any more centered than they were in their hay day. Still, A true fleewood mac fan would want the special edition, but for the casual fan, stick to the cheaper version."
3,SAY YOU WILL (2003),"This is a great album by Fleetwood Mac and my favorite song is Goodbye Baby, it really is a great song. But this album could have been WAY better if some songs werent included. Those being, Smile At You, Say Goodbye, Destiny Rules, Whats the World Coming To, Murrow Turning Over In His Grave, Illume (9/11) and Red Rover. That would bring it to 10 songs without what I think is filler."
2,What a disappointment,"I should have read the reviews on this CD. What a disappointment. It's all true. The band without Christina McVie is shallow, of poor quality; and a poor attempt of Fleetwood Mac to enters the Pop genre. I bought concert tickets before I realized that she was not with the band anymore. Woe is me. They have lost a lot of depth relying on electronic wizardry to make much of their music acceptable. The cover is a good one. However, they should have remained laying on the floor rather than trying to revive thier previous wonderful sounds."
1,Not That Funny... is it?,"Although Stevie Nicks turns in a few good songs here -- ""Running Through The Garden"", ""Everybody Finds Out"", ""Destiny Rules"" -- Lindsey Buckingham's songs are rather disappointing. Creative? Experimental? No way! Let's just acknowledge the obvious... Christine McVie held the real appeal for listening to Fleetwood Mac (the voices of McVie and Nicks together was always magical). Without Christine McVie, there is no Fleetwood Mac! I won't give ""Say You Will"" a second listen. If you want good Fleetwood Mac, listen to anything from ""Kiln House"" to ""The Dance"" ."
5,Handy little gadget,"Bought it as a gift for a family member, works great and is very easy to cary, using it for a gate opener"
1,No range on the unit I received,"This little remote is the perfect size, but the unit I received only had a 3 foot range, even after I replaced the battery.I sent it back for a refund. I might order another and see if it was a poorly made individual unit. The other reviewers did not seem to complain about bad range issues so it might have just been the one I received."
