2,corn broom,"Broom is cute and perfect size for child. The only negative is although the broom appeared to be fairly well constructed, the string weaved through the broom holding it together was not tied off. It appears that when it was made, it was just cut close to the broom. We pulled it back tight but couldn't tie it off so we used a little glue - don't know how long it will hold."
1,Uprising Records Blows!,"fall out boy are great dudes. not to mention a talented, tight, determined, and pretty humble group of people. don't even think about buying this record tho! i know that this record was put out to only fill up a release on their b.s. contract with Uprising Records. the owner of that label, sean uprising, sucks. he's a total piece who's only out to make money on some good bands who unwittingly sign crippling record deals. he's even about to RE-RELEASE this exact record... why? ..cuz he's a money hungry dirtbag who's capitolizing on a good band that was finally recognized. don't buy this cd, go download it. the band agrees."
2,In Their Own Words,"The band members often rip on themselves and this album, admitting that they weren't that great before Take This To Your Grave. To me, this was just a ploy by their former label to make some cash on Fall Out Boy's name. Save your money."
1,EFF FOB!!!,"Unlike every other FOB cd, this one's effing horrible. Don't buy it. If you're smart, you'd buy The Promise Ring's ""Very Emergency"" instead."
3,Remastered for Better or Worse,"Overall, the album is one of my favorites, old stuff is always the best, but if you're in doubt, buy it. I personally favor the orginal pressing of EOWYG to the new one. First of all, Uprising (record label) is collecting all of the benefits from this Re-Release, Not FALL OUT BOY, Fall Out Boy does not own the rights to these songs and they are not making ANY money from the Re-Release. Second, the volume levels of the vocals have been upped, to decrease the 'Echoing' effect, but it seems a little too much. Pete's bass, the drums, Joe's Guitar, and Patrick's Guitar are all upped when they are the main instrument being used. its like there is a solo every 10 seconds. the album art is all re-vamped, but there is NO, i repeat NO bonus tracks or any supplementary material. if you are a fan of fall out boy, first buy the original EOWYG if you can find it, (i found mine at an FYE for $17), and if you cant, go for this, it's the next best thing."
3,Fall Out Boy is one of the best bands out there right now...,"... but this CD was unfortunatly made on a very low budget. All the songs are good, and you can tell they have talent, but it seems as though the production was rushed. My favorite tracks are Honorable Mention and Growing Up. Calm Before the storm is a great song, but there's a much better version on Take This To Your Grave. You should definatly check out Take This to Your Grave. I just got into this band a couple weeks ago, and I can't stop listening to that CD, I must listen to it at least 3 times a day, it's that good."
4,Great first time Camcorder,"This DV camera is amazing. I have researched many cameras in the same class and this one seems to be a bargain compared to the competition as the feature set is concerned.Mini-DVEasy-QEZ Dial NavigatorOptical 10x /Digital 800x Zoom Lens1/6"", 680k Pixel CCDPower Nite PixDespite what people say, this camera can handle a 128 Megabyte memory stick and possibly up to 256 megabytes. Not that brand matters but I used a SanDisk 128 memory Stick. You should make sure that you format your stick using the camera's format feature before using it."
5,Awesome Bang for the Buck!,"I bought this camcorder at Aldi Foods (yes a grocery store) brand new for 299.99! I bought a Lexar brand 64MB Memory Stick off of Ebay for $19.99 and after formatting in from the Camcorder's Menu it works perfect. Holds up to 371 pictures and all I have to do is plug it into my pc's usb port and it instantly comes up. With the memory stick inserted into the camcorder you can switch the camcorder over to ""Memory"" mode and my windows XP automatically puts a removeable drive on my PC to copy over all my PICS. The quality of the .jpgs is not earth shattering but to get a 2 in 1 product for under 300.00 I can't complain at all. You do have to watch your lighting so your pictures don't turn out ""grainy"". I use the ""VLight"" a lot on my pictures/camcording when I'm inside. I haven't tried the Video capture yet because I don't own a firewire cable/card. I figure that will be my next purchase. I highly recommend the Camcorder for anyone looking for a cheap 2 in one product!Have fun!"
5,Do you just want to make home videos?,"I love this camcorder because it is what I need for home videos inside and outside of the house. I chose this one over Sony and Canon because I specifically wanted a memory card slot to store pics opposed to having them recorded on the tape. To get this feature in Sony or Canon I would have to have bought a $700-800 model. It's very durable little camcorder and the size! It's really small. Another good feature for me, a person with small hands. Overall, if your looking for a camcorder to tape your kids' games, gift opening on x-mas morning or for wildlife viewing with the great option of taking still digital pictures this is the camera for you!"
4,Great Camera / Terrible Tech Support,"PROS: The camera takes great video quality and is easily hooked to a tv/vcr for larger viewing. Very easy to use and I love the night vision.CONS: Unable to download video to computer... Windows XP won't recognize camera...So if you just want to transfer your video to VHS, it's a great camera to buy..."
2,Sensor Chip went bad. Buy Extended Warranty,I bought this model and had it for a little more than a year. It worked wonderfully but then 1 day out of the blue the LCD or eye piece would not work when i wanted to record something. The playback worked fine but when I wanted to shoot something it went all black. I did some research and the problem was with the a sensor chip being bad. This is a known issue to happen (based on all the people I read having this issue on the internet). In any case it will cost me $288 to replace and repair the camera. If I had bought the extended warranty it would not costed me anything. I am contemplating on just buying a different make and model from another manufacturer.It's like a car do you really want to spend the money on a rebuilt engine or transmission. There's always that risk it can break again.
3,Faulty Samsung SCD23 Mini DV recorder,"I really enjoyed my Samsung SCD23 Mini DV recoreder but last week it broke. I bought it in July 2004. Now the LCD just shows static and it does not record an image. That make me really mad because I was hoping that it would have lasted much longer than this. I found out that it will cost me just as much to get it fixed as it would to buy a new one. Next time, I will buy a different brand with better reliability. Samsung just sells cheap products. I will never by another Samsung product again."
5,pleasant,We use this for massage to help wind down. I was afraid it was going to be a bit heavily scented and thus a hinderance to relaxation. It is just right. You don't even notice the scent unless you are searching for it. I would order it again.
3,The story tells a tale of extraordinary love and sadness,"I found the story a little challenging to read , however, it struck my heart so deep that I could'nt put it down . The amount of love that was expressed was unreal.A perculiar story , Thomas Hardy has used the un touched parts of his imagination to shock the reader . The story is beautiful , and disturbing ."
4,Good Troubleshooting Tool - One Problem,"Mine (purchased elsewhere) arrived with the bulb out of the socket. The socket is made of very thin, flimsy metal. The hooks that are supposed to hold the pins at the bottom sides of the bayonet lamp base had bent outward, allowing the lamp to be ejected by the force of the center pin contact spring. The hooks can be easily twisted inward using needle-nose pliers (or even tweezers). If you insert the lamp carefully into the socket and carefully insert the lamp/buzzer assembly back into the probe, then you have a very useful tool.In case you should at some time need to replace the bulb, it is a standard #1893, 0.33A at 14V bulb. The number is printed on the bulb base, but may be difficult to read.The directions say the probe can be used up to 28V, but the bulb would burn out quickly at twice rated voltage. If you do use it on a 24V system, you should change the bulb to #1818."
4,Takes some practice,"I bought these snorkels for my husband and myself for our trip to Mexico. They worked very well once you got used to them. At first I noticed (as some other reviewers reported) that sometimes, even if my snorkel wasn't submerged, it would close and I couldn't breathe in. However, with a little patience and practice I realized that if I just changed the angle of my snorkel it worked great. Overall, I am very satisfied."
5,"Fun, Exciting and Sexy","Excellent!!!Benson did a very good job in keeping his ""Bond"" similar to Ian Fleming's ""Bond"". The book was writen in an excelent style, making the words turn to pictures in your mind. My only problem was I had to put the book down once in a while."
4,Good story but UNNEEDED SENTENCES!!!!,"There are a few sentences in which Benson could have written better, for example: ""Fility habit."" Bond said to the unconsious man. It is obvious that Bond had been speaking to the man, who else could it be? It could be change to ""Bond shooked his head"" or simply ""Bond sighed"" Nevertheless, I still think the plot is good."
4,A definitive improvement over the movie.,"Granted, a Bond movie can give you only so much characterization, but Benson's book makes much more sense in the characters' backgrounds and motivations. Benson also has a far better handle on the Bond character that was lacking from John Gardner's efforts. Benson manages to reintroduce you into the elements of Fleming's Bond world without attempting to copy Fleming's writing style. Given the terrific results of Zero Minus Ten and Tomorrow Never Dies, I'm eagerly awaiting The Facts of Death."
3,Great gate if you're not planning to use extensions.,"I have this gate set up in two different parts of my house... one part as-is, and one part with two extensions. The gate that that has no extensions is very durable, and easy to open, however there is a bar that goes across the bottom of the ""door"", and myself and my guests are always bumping bare toes on it...ouch!In the other part of my house, I have this gate with two extensions. It's such a LONG gate, that there is no stability... the whole thing kind of sways, and my toddler finally was able to pull it out of the wall. There aren't many gates out there that will let you cover such a wide room, though, and for that it was nice while it lasted."
5,Great gate for dog,"Bought this gate to keep a small dog in a room. The entry area is not symmetrical and the gate was configurable to fit perfectly. Works well, looks good and feels solid. Highly recommend for this use."
5,A concise introduction to Egyptian Culture and Religion,"This pocket book would be my first recommendation to an interested archeological layperson who has an interest in, but no prior knowledge of, ancient Egyptian society, art, history and religion. Reading this introduction will prepare you for a more in-depth study of ncient Egypt, its people and Gods."
4,lots of fun,"solid book...nice to see all three nick drake lps listed-- disappointed that can only rated two titles,but hey that's what's fun about this...nice to see fairport dominate the folk list and gram parson take the top three slots on the country list...u.s. readers should be aware that that over the last 12 years or so, british and european tastes in rock music have diverged considerably from american, and those who haven't kept up will think that the book overemphasizes bands from the uk.british groups continue to enjoy mass popularity in europe and austrlia that they no longer enjoy in the us, while many bands widely popular in the u.s. generate little interest overseas...this book reflects that"
2,Model of unreliablility,"I got this out of a simple desire to be woken up by my favourite songs. Straight away it failed to run a single MP3 off my burnt CDs. In the year since, I've had an alarm button literally break and cannot get normal CD track to run in order. It functions now as a regular radio for me. For my relatively modest needs, this Dream Machine was an expensive hassle. Dang!"
2,cd player died after 5 months,"not impressed, I just packed this up to ship back to sony.If I paid less for it, I would've just pitched it in the trash and avoided a sony next time. I had to deal with a voice recognition system for customer service ( how lame is that? )I was finally able to get a semi-english speaking person on the other end of the line who made me unplug\plug-in the unit to see if that would fix it... ( no, it's not a windows pc )cd players have been around for about 20 years now, it seems to me that they should be able to build a fairly reliable one at this point."
5,Strange Gems,"I happen to like MAD DOG TIME (or TRIGGER HAPPY as I first knew it) very much indeed, but I like a great many strange and flawed films.It seems to me that the makers of this film are poking fun at both the harmless gangsters of GUYS AND DOLLS and ROBIN AND THE SEVEN HOODS, and at the High Seriousness of THE GODFATHER and its progeny. I know of only one Gangster film that surpasses it in outright weirdness - ONCE UPON A TIME IN AMERICA - and the only one that is more darkly comic is GOODFELLAS, which most people treat as serious drama.If you ever scoffed at the good hearted gangsters of the '50's and 60's musicals, or laughed at the pretensiousness of 70's and 80's gangster noir, you may like this film a lot. Or you may hate it. It is a very peculiar vision, and not to all tastes. But don't dismiss it without a look. There will probably never be another film anything like it."
2,DISAPPOINTING PRESENTATION,Child abuse is a serious subject and social issue. This book is NOT an objective research nor handling of the topic. There are many better books without the blatant bias and misinformation. Claire Reeves is more interested in self promotion of her agenda and book sales. The system for exposing and redressing the problem is ignored by the authur in her shameless self dealing hype. There are better books. Read them.
4,"written long ago, but very intense and thought provoking","Excellent book on learning how to grow in your walk with Jesus. It actualy helps you perceive things differently in terms of how God sees us, and how we should see ourselves in regard to Christ's work."
5,"Bali has ""just right"" fit !","This style has just the right fit. ""No slip"" strap is just as it says!Thank goodness for the wide selection on sizes!"
5,5 Video Set,"This box set includes Constantive and the Cross, David And Goliath, Esther and the King, Herod The Great, & Saul and David."
2,Sent Wrong CD,"I was sent the wrong CD, but the CD I received did have all the songs that I had expected from the requested CD. Also had many I don't care about. Recordings are good, however, so still a good purchase."
3,Wise men still seek Him,I enjoyed this book about the Nativity. It has action and romance and I believe captures the spirit of the times. The Three Wise Men coming from the Far East and not from Babylon does not jibe with history.
1,Lacking,"This has to be one of the most boring books I have ever read in my life, therefore making it a waste of my time to read it. I would not have bought the book unless if I wouldn't have had to write an essay on it for my History 1050 class. I do not recommend this book for casual reading, in fact, I do not recommend this book at all. However, if you are involved in History as a profession, or if you are excited by History, then this is a book for you. It provides tons of information, but to me it is all irrelevant. If you are a college student with many other things to do like myself, I will personally tell you right now to leave this book on the shelf."
2,Dull and Depressing,"Ayn Rand certainly brings to life the desperation and the hard living of Soviet Russia (unemployment, money problems, food problems, rationalization, etc.) but cannot keep an interesting storyline amidst 400+ pages of fluff and melodrama. Not recommended."
5,readable and less than 1000 pages,"I picked up a musty old copy from the 1959 recently..being in a glow about Atlas. This book moved me beyond belief with the struggles and harsh realities presented. I probably am one of the few Rand readers that like her clumsy style but in this story, her words flowed well and the American reader did not get all mixed up with long names and places that we could not reference. To quote Ayn: ""..is not a novel about Soviet Russia. It is a novel about Man against the State. Its basic theme is the sanctity of human life..."" To those who associate Ayn with the defenders of big companies and nazism...remember her semi autobiographical outlet in Kira. People that were Ayn's protagonists were those with life premises, to live and exist for themselves. Be it Dagny or Andrei, Ayn Rand's message was true and bittersweet."
4,We the living,"We the living by Ayn Rand is a stark reminder of society where the rights of the individual are forsaken for the masses, and the bleak existence that follows. thought provoking read!"
4,Book for Work Relationships,"The service was wonderful, the book is pretty good. I was able to apply some of the ideas and sugggestions from the book toward the workplace environment."
4,Surprisingly helpful from an accidental reader,My wife bought the book and I was sceptical when I first saw it. I accidentally left it on a low table and our puppy picked it up and shredded most of the first chapter. I bought another copy from Amazon to replace the damaged copy. As I tried to repair the torn pages a few words caught my attention and after that I could not put it down. Take it from an initial sceptic that this book has very helpful suggestions and practical advice that you can readily apply. I highly recommend this book to anybody who is working.
4,"New to Bright Eyes, but I like it","This is the electronic counterpart to Wide Awake....I guess I got into Bright Eyes after hearing Them (him) featured on NPR. I think it takes about 4-5 listens to fully enjoy.The instruments bathe the vocals and create a magic landscape if just for a few minutes it takes me to Omaha. My favorite song is Theme to Pinate. Next I would say Easy/Lucky/Free. This song could easily be played on the radio and should be a radio hit, but probably will not.Musically Digital Ash.... is apparently a departure for Bright Eyes. After listening to some of their other songs off other CDs, I can see that. The CD is not perfect neither lyrically or musically, but this is easily one of the best CDs of 2005. The reason is the honestly and the balance of the record. He also takes some risks that pay off. I know it is early, but I think this will be on lots of best of lists at the end of the year along with the other Bright Eyes CD that was released the same day."
5,"Thanks, everything was perfect!",There is nothing quite like vinyl.I have been a huge fan of Bright Eyes and anything produced by Saddle Creek records. Awesome!
3,"Good, but way overrated","I do consider myself a Bright Eyes fan, but Oberst is hugely overrated. The guy has a personality that shines through on each song he does and his storytelling songs are thoughtfully-written and melodic. But this dude is not Dylan! Can we please stop the comparisons. As far as this album goes, it's not as brilliantly love-angst or enigmatic as the other album, but pretty decent. Just because a bunch of white suburb-teen girls are in love with him, doesn't make him the king of indie. Of course if you just listen to what Rolling Stone, Paste, Spin, etc. tells you is good indie music you may be misdirected."
5,"Pet Sounds, 2005","Holy moly, touched by the hand of god just begins to describe the wonders of this little overlooked album. Beach Boys' 'Pet Sounds' song structure meets Depeche Mode's 'Black Celebration' production. One for the pop ages, this one. Melodies so startling thick they trip over themselves from start to finish. Typically strong lyric: ""when the smoke came out our mouths on all those hooded sweatshirt walks/ you were a stroke of luck/ we were a goldmine and they gutted us"".A hot-house flower of an album, probably unable to be duplicated. The initial bewildered reaction to this album now over, it should grow in appreciation nicely. Ahhh, if only good music were stocks..."
2,"Write your own tunes next time, Oberst.","Kinks.New Order.Bob Dylan.etc...Nice lyrics, but tunes (and the hooks especially) sound far too familiar, no matter if they're dressed up with beeps and electrical whistles.I guess with two albums to release so close together he had to cut corners somewhere. Do your own work next time, Oberst."
3,Broken Cup,"Great bottom bracket. Rides very smooth. However, it comes with a plastic cup unlike what the picture shows. Within 3 weeks of riding, the plastic cup already has a large crack in it. Now I have to pay over $20 to get a metal one that wont break."
2,Eh.,"I had high hopes for this movie.Unfortunately, the CGI just wasn't up to it; it was almost good enough but not quite. And while I loved the bits that stuck true to the original - most of the beginning - the ""plot twist"" which took the movie away from the original epic poem was kind of depressing. If it were a normal movie taking place in Viking society with characters named other names and they ended it this way, that would be great; but once again someone had to go take a perfectly good classic and use the ""brand name"" to sell a story that bore only loose relation to the original tale. See the most recent ""King Arthur"" for another one of these unnecessary alterations."
1,Dreadful!,"This is the first time I have been sufficiently moved to post a review, unfortunately for the wrong reasons. It is bad enough that this film has been portrayed as a live action movie, but after watching the first 5 minutes I understood why they didn't advertise the fact it was animated, the animation is dreadful.Scenes where the characters were not moving or talking were quite well done, that is the justification of the one star I have awarded. The, direction and framing gave the appearance of an early scooby-doo carton, in-fact I think scooby-doo's attention to scaling and composition is slightly better.Can animated characters show feeling? Yes, this lot looked embarassed."
2,Letdown,"I remember the reviews were very mixed when it was in the theatres, but I was still looking forward to watching this on DVD. However, I found it to be disappointing.I thought it was a mistake doing the entire film in motion capture animation. It was also unnecessary - even though a number of the action scenes couldn't have been done completely in live action, greenscreen technology could have been used for those while using the real actors the rest of the time (see any of the Lord of the Rings films).And how many times can the guy scream his own name (probably about as many times as they used the Austin Powers ""hide the salami"" bit)?I thought the fight with the dragon was outstanding (hence the second star), but the movie could have been so much better."
1,One of the worst movies ever made,Saw this in the movie theater because I like to see Angelina half naked on a big screen. Expected similar coolness to 300 or Sin City but this movie was terrible!!!!Can't even imagine what Hopkins and Jolie and where thinking to be in this s... .Don't waste your money
3,Worth seeing in 3D,"A severely disabled child with extreme behavioural problems is murdered by glory-seekers hired by his father. Understandably, his mother is a little upset. Vengeance ensues... Faithless CGI rendering of the classic tale poses two questions. More than a decade and several billion dollars into the digital era, why can the nerds of Hollywood still not accurately depict human movement or fire? And why is it that our standards of moral decency make it acceptable to show disembowelling, dismembering and gut-clenching cruelty, and yet not the cartoon rendering of a female nipple or a flaccid penis? Baffling questions aside, it's worth seeing. Catch the 3D version at IMAX if you can."
1,Hwaet! This is terrible!,"This re-telling of the great tale of Beowulf is an utter failure in every way. The animation is dank, dark, dull. The characters look more like uncomfortable robots than imitations of living creatures. The basic story is trashed and Grendel's mother (the animated Jolie) is ridiculous. Read the epic itself* or see the movie, ""Beowulf and Grendel"", if you must see it on the big screen. But skip this awful interpretation.*There are decent poetic translation by Frederick Rebsamen and Dick Ringler that are worth looking into if you really want to get what Beowulf is about. A dramatic recitation is given by Benjamin Bagby in Anglo-Saxon (with subtitles) and is available on DVD - excerpts can be viewed on Youtube."
1,Let's Watch a Video Game!!!,Watching this movie is akin to the experience of watching someone play a video game though maybe not as stimulating.
3,Beouwulf,"Have not watched it yet, so I can really pass on my take on the movie. I heard lots of good things about the movie from others and wanted to own it."
1,Waste of time,"The only way I could tell this movie was about Beowulf was because one of the characters kept proclaiming ""I am Beowulf!"" Boring animation, a story only sort of related to the epic, plenty of cinematic action cliches. Pretty much a total waste of time.It's hard to believe Neil Gaiman had something to do with this. It has basically spoiled Gaiman for me."
1,STINKY-BAD!!!!!,"Tell me, how do stupid people get to make major motion pictures?Ugly to look at, stupid to listen to, and pointless to follow--this has little to do with the great epic (other than sharing a title).It is my belief that the dopey director and stultifying cast decided to make this since the original epic was out of copyright and, lacking any ideas or originality, they seized on the opportunity to TRY to read it and understand it.Alas, they failed.Save your money; save your time. Watch an old Popeye cartoon, instead."
1,Beowulf,"This dvd was not what I expected. It was true to the story, but I didn't like the animated look to everything."
3,To live and become a legend,"I went to see a 3D Imax and was glad that this movie was only 113 mins. The CGI makes it difficult to my eyes a comfort level to enjoy the film.To make a 3D movie, it's inevitable that the characters look gaming; only I wish I had a controller in hand.Beowulf is a hero and also like one of us who have desires and emotions. His human nature almost fell the same destiny as the prior king, but he chose a different path.A hero also bears great responsibility to both oneself, as well as to others. Such quality also reflects to us who are same as Beowulf that we live our own life and legend, being responsible gives you a sense of stability and security, and it fulfills you from inside since you realize that you're someone others can count on."
4,Good movie,"Again, Good movie but is a ""cartoon"" not real people. Sometimes can tell sometimes looks real. Watch it and see for yourself and make up your own mind"
1,Blank disk,I got this so I wouldn't have to read the book and it showed up and didn't work in any device and was a blank disk
1,"Bad, Really Bad","A little bit of cartoon violence, a little bit of cartoon sex, a dash of religious bigotry, but no connection at all to the epic poem (other than the title) on which it is supposedly based. If the people who made the movie ever read the poem, they obviously did not understand it. The viewer's time would be better served in reading the text and an insightful piece of criticism, such as Tolkien's ""Beowulf: The Monsters and The Critics."""
2,Why don't we just watch video games instead?,"Enough!!! Can Hollywood get any lazier? Actors command salaries for voice only when added to Animation? It's not acting! And, if I wanted to see such, I would just watch a Video Game in simulation mode! Beowulf might have been awesome if presented in true physical acting form.To get the bad taste out of my mouth, I popped in my ""Excalibur"" DVD. Guess what, almost 30 years ago, a great sword epic could be done with Real Actors and non-computer generated special effects.What's up with today's Hollywood? Producers, Directors, Actors: Take a look at your past if you want to see a brighter future!"
2,I DID NOT LIKE LIKE IT,"Some gamers like my self don`t always play MultiPlayer.So the MP playing is good but not Single player just running around killing computer Bots is boring.The main game was alright and going up against a ""boss""(A leader of the bad guys who is hard to beat) was challenging the hardest are Bastille,Syra and Tal-Set beating Tal using Torok unlocks raptor who can only stab its victims to death.A good selection of guns my favorate the freze gun and Insulater because,first i freezw the enemy then i shoot the Insulater at her/him and he/she starts blowing up like a baloon and the skin gets week so BOOM SPLAT he blows up and his/her flesh is every where.These were the only good points in the game but nowhere as fun as Turok:Dinosaur Hunter because its more adventurious.I have got a PS2,GC and N64mY TOP 3 GAMES ON n64 ARE1)007 GoldenEye2)Turok:Dinosaur Hunter3)Super Mario-64bye"
5,Perfect present for the curious 3 year old,"There is a local company that has a very large building with many different things for kids to play with and one station includes the fuselage of a plane along with these exact hats. I was glad to find them available for purchase via Amazon and got it for my daughter for her 3rd birthday. She loved it and it fit great! She's a little bit bigger for her age so, contrary to some other opinions expressed, I would think this would fit good for any kid Kindergarten and below."
2,Slow set...,"I absolutely did not like this product. I did give it two stars for the benefit of a doubt... But I had absolutely no luck. I mixed per the instructions (which weren't very good), and it set before I got it mixed (and I was using a jiffy mixer even). I've used alginate powders in the past and never had a problem before. This was just terrible."
1,why?,the word dissapointment can not adequately express my feelings about this game. perhaps my expectations were so high. admittedly the graphics in this game were good but that did little to improve the horrible scenarios. whatsmore after playing a game like tomb raider were tthe game can be saved at any point a game like shadowman its limited saving positions i found myself doing the same things over and over and over again. all of my friends agreed that this game was horrible and even started laughing at me when they saw me playing it. i would recommend this game for no one
1,Waste of money,"Dated, way too expensive and disorganized. Am a big buyer of books that cover various aspects of the trade lifecycle, risk management, p&l etc..but this one left a LOT to be desired."
2,"Weak, too many parts, doesn't stand up","Just a poor net when compared to the rest. Yes, it's cheaper than most and there is a reason for that. If you are using it for hitting, even 5-6 year olds will occasionally hit the ball over. If you are 6'3 like me and get any lift on the ball you'll never hit it in the net without actually hitting the net.Get the jugs if you want quick set up or the big mouth if that isn't as important."
1,First time fell apart,"The very first time my son kicked a ball in the net a stability bolt that holds the whole thing together broke and popped off and was unrepairable. ;-( We have sent it back and will shop for one we can see the quality before purchasing.Thanks,Andrea"
1,Do Not Buy this piece of Junk,"I ordered this for my 14 year old son to practice pitching. 24 pitches into using it and it was broken (center 'target' torn) in two places. I requested a return and Amazon had another one sent out immediately. The second one has last about 100 pitches. It is has torn in the same place as the first. The target is held onto the the main frame by an elastic band with a hook on it. The sewing of the band to the material of the target is so bad that if a ball hits in the are, it will snap.Do not buy this item. It is a total peice of junk. Spend your money on something of higher quality and hopefully it won't be such a piece..."
3,"Decent mix, but missing much","I recently just saw Mortal Kombat for the first time and I couldn't believe how much they used Stabbing Westward throughout the movie. However, they are no where to be found on the soundtrack. If you are looking for some of the songs in the film that didn't make the soundtrack, you may find them on Stabbing Westward's ""Ungod"" album. ""Lost"", ""Lies"", and ""Can't Happen Here"" were all sampled for the film."
3,interesting mix,"a little techno,a little metal.but not good techno,and definately not good metal.a few decent cuts(utah saint in particular)i bought this Cd to use in my Kickboxing class to train to,thinking from other reviews that the music was metal with techno influence or visa versa.but actually the first half of the album is electronic and the second half metal.and again,neither genre represented very well."
3,FileMaker Pro Companion,"File Maker pro companion is a wonderful book and is laied out very well, it compliments nicely with the user manuals that are included with filemaker pro 5, and also adds some tips and techniques that are not discussed in the manuals"
1,This movie SUCKS,"Absolutely awful black comedy tries to be darkly humorous like Heathers and Very Bad Things and ends up being plain dark. A teen fascinated with serial killers and murder decides he wants to be a killer after he graduates from High School and a real life killer is killing people in the town. A desperate attempt at black comedy with barely any laughs and even the black-humor isn't very funny. Avoid this and rent Pulp Fiction,Very Bad Things,or any other dark comedy out there. Despite Thomas Haden Church's funny performance as a mean coach this movie is a BOMB."
5,9 year old loves reading,"If you want your 9 year old to read, give him something that he won't want to put down. My grandson loves this book."
3,"Product OK, but watch shipping costs","The product was good, but I paid for expedited shipping and the items didn't arrive as soon as expected."
4,Like,I liked Shakespeare courses in college. Many theories on his writings and if he actually was the author of it all.
2,Too small.,This book is thicker than it is wide with tiny type. The description may have explained how small the book is but I didn't realize this would be painfully small.
5,Excellent for what I have used it for,"I have used this machine for a few months now, but have not made use of all possible features. However, this is what I can say:* basic copying, fax, scanning -- Excellent* scanning with character recognition -- Excellent but would prefer to have options ala OmniPage* duplex printing(printing on both sides) -- Very Good, except the menu digging is ackward* build quality and overall performace -- Excellent, prints fast, few jams, feels very sturdy* ease of use -- very good and straight forward* features -- Excellent, loaded with capabilitiesThis machine is beautiful and no other machine I have used comes close, save for high end office machines costing $thousands. I can't get over how happy I am with this one, I've been waiting for a quality MFC since before they came out, and finally I am satisfied. Highly recommended."
2,Poor Manufacturing Quality,"I am about to return my second one. The first one the fax didn't work. The second one eats up envelopes every other print. I am very dissatisfied with the printer, though amazon took it back with no problems."
3,Cloudy...,"Don't get me wrong, I don't think this was a bad book, but on the other hand, I don't think that there was anything particularly great about it either.The author comes up with an interesting scenerio, that of what would happen if people, through some fluke of happenstance, were able to remember much more than normal, and how it would affect their lives.The result, however, was disappointing, as the book seemed to get just as muddled in the middle as the characters who got bogged down in the flood of memories. There's a reason that writers are warned against using too many flashbacks in writing, and having a whole book of such tends to prove the point."
3,Great concept...but failure to deliver,"I really wanted to like this book.I tried hard to follow the ins and outs of it, but it was confusing going from present to the past with out any indication of which was which. great premise but this author did not pull it off.The best part of the book is the thought that this could really happen in today's world. It makes one wonder that if it did happen, would the town be told.I've seen others compare it to Time Traveler's Wife. i do not agree, you always knew where you were with that book.this book is original and kooky and quirky but the author tried too hard IMHO."
5,Great for Work,This little guy is great. I've had it for about 8 months. I use it at work. Doesn't take up much desk space. The sound is good for what it is.
3,Keep Looking,This item makes a high pitched noise when it is plugged in to the wall. It doesn't make that sound while running only on the batteries. If you plan on using the batteries its fairly a good speaker. Sound is clear and fills the room. The high pitched noise can be drowned out if you turn the music up loud but if you plan on using it to sleep by or having the volume down low its very annoying. I plan on purchasing a more expensive speaker with a remote and just using this one for travel purposes.
1,Not as good as _Wildlife_ book,"I agree with Sola's review and it's true that most of the pictures in _Song..._ can be found in his previous publication, _Wildlife_. Here are a few extra considerations: One of the things that makes the earlier work, _Wildlife_, a better book, is layout: none of the pictures in it are split between two pages. In _Song_, several of Brenders' best paintings are laid out this way, and it seriously detracts from one's appreciation of his work. Even if I liked the (generally insipid) poetry which is splashed all over the pages of _Song_, the addition does nothing to enhance either the poetry or the artwork. The few redeemming features of _Song_ include a larger, somewhat better copy of ""Pathfinder: Red Fox"", a stunning painting of a snow leopard, and also a tiger (not in the first work). Otherwise, a great artist deserves a better presentation than this book provides."
2,Deceptive Description,"This item is described as being "" 2"" Tall "". It is actually a tad under 1.5"". I e-mailed Sabrina Silver about my dissatisfaction with the deceptive description of the cross. They wrote me back that they didn't like my ""tone"" and that they were not going to apologize. They have however changed the description. Be advised though that the newly described height includes the loop on top of the cross."
4,Soft Wedge is a great tool for the Uke,I've tried about 4 different styles of picks for my uke. Strumming for me is a challenge because w/o a pick I lose my rhythm as my fingers tend to get ahead of the rest of me. This pick not only helps me to keep my fingers focused but it also allows me to play loud too. The rubber wedge offers a cleaner sound and is much more comfortable to hold than any other pick that I have tried. For the price and the fact that you get 3 - how can you go wrong?!?!?! If you want to use a pick and either aren't pleased with the felt styles you've used in the past or realize that the guitar pics belong no where near your uke PLEASE order the SOFT WEDGE - Oh if only they came with funky designs then it would be a pinch of perfection!
4,Looking back and happy,Once I got the old one out( Not so easy) Then new one fit in great. No more right side blind spot the size of Kansas
4,Hours of fun!,My daughter of 8 loves this game. She refuses to put it down. The gameplay is intuitively obvious. She was enjoying the game rightout of the package without wasting a lot of time figuring out commands.
4,love these but why no 1/3 tsp?,"I have these in addition to the regular advanced performance. love both, they are sturdy and will last forever. But it's a little strage that with both sets there is no 1/3 tsp. i could do without the ""pinch"" or even replacing the 2/3 with a 1/3..."
4,Soundtrack to 16,"I got this cd for my 16th birthday, 2 copies in fact. I had heard Goodbye on the Mortal Kombat soundtrack, and decided ""this is a cool band"". Then they dropped the single for Guilty, and I knew it had to be mine. So it became the soundtrack to 16 for me. It was a great time, I hardly ever took it out of my cd player. I also got all the remix cds. Those are tight too, especially the Juno Reactor mixes. There isnt a bad track on here, the only reason i give it 4 stars, instead of 5, is because it seems to be one track sometimes. The beat is consistant throughout the cd. This is something they fixed on their next cd, Perversion. Pick up all their cds. It's win-win.The only thing I don't like is everyone comparing them to NIN. It's not the same thing, not at all. The only place i can see that, is NIN's best song ever (The Perfect Drug).Better than NIN any day."
4,"Could use some variety, but still awesome!","This is one of my favorite CD's. It is good hard rock but with some different twists. The only complaint I have is that many of the songs sound very similar, but when they are that good, I don't care!"
4,The best of the series so far.,"This book in stands out from the its predecessors in the series, it is much better. There is more feeling and more writing than usual about Hornblower the person and his thoughts and feelings and mental struggles. And the battle scene descriptions seem even better than previous novels in the series."
4,The fifth novel in the Hornblower series....,"It is the year 1808 and Hornblower, with the 36 gun ship HMS Lydia, is sent somewhere west of Nicaragua to join forces with an insane Spanish landowner to fight the Spanish government. Little did he know how complex things would become. First he had to deal with the Spanish ship-of-the-line, the Natividad, a 50 gun warship or face being court-martialed. THEN add the Lady Barbara Wellesley, who is very distracting for even a married man, and add a tiny twist that, half-way through the book, Spain switches SIDES! What will happen now?"
2,It didn't live up to all the hype and rave reviews.,"I anticipated the reading of ""Rosewood Casket"" when it became our book group's selection for January. I spent a summer with my country cousins in the very area her story takes place. However, after 100 pages I still struggled to see where the story was headed and I didn't feel pulled into the ""suspense"" or even grow to care about the personalities she portrayed. My husband and I finished the book for our club but we do not plan on following up with any of her other books. We felt we were reading the script for a made-for-tv movie whose plot rambles and then is neatly wrapped up at the end with a implausable finale. We appreciated the quotes from Daniel Boone that prefaced each chapter. They were the best part."
5,Beautifully written and with literary merit.....,"I came across the Rosewood Casket in one of my bookshelves, a first edition I had no memory of buying. Most often drawn to British writers (or Americans who ""write British""), I was quickly drawn not only into Sharyn McCrumb's story, but her style and clear indication that she knows English and how to use it to great advantage. She is unpretentious and even her other-worldly concerns are non-intrusive and never offensive. She is a very gifted writer, indeed. I'd regret that I hadn't read her before, but now I get to read EVERYTHING. Now that I've finished the Rosewood Casket, I handed it to my husband, Allan Eckert. We sat across from her last year at the Kentucky Book Fair and I enjoyed her delightful personality very much. Now I can enjoy her wonderful books."
3,A mystery without a mystery...,"More a character study than a mystery (the murder is rather incidental to the plot), ""The Rosewood Casket"" is still a must for fans. McCrumb can get a little preachy at times, however. In ""The Hangman's Beautiful Daughter"" she pontificated about water pollution; in this book it's the overdevelopment of the wilderness by unscrupulous realtors. I sympathize with the issue, but feel sometimes that all the talk gets in the way of the plot. Also, the seven year old in this particular story is just a little too well-spoken and philisophical for her years. All that said, time spent with McCrumb is time well spent. She continues to be one of the sharpest, most serious ""mystery"" writers around."
2,Two or three good songs...,"...but the rest is barely mediocre. In fact, most of the songs sound the same. Not a purchase I was pleased with, and as soon as I get around to putting the two or three decent songs on a mix, this one's probably getting sold to the used CD shop up the street. If you want, you can pick it up there for $8, and start the vicious cycle all over again."
4,"A Great release, if you like stuff technical w/breakdowns","It's a shame that this band broke up in 2002. The majority of the songs turn into slow to mid-paced hardcore, but they have many outbursts of furious speed, with wizardry guitar work, and mathcore drumming. Some mellow songs on this disc, with very well written acoustic guitar work. Lyrics have to do with heartbreak, and thinking of better days. For someone who likes to hear thrashy, fast scales, with hardcore breakdowns. Highly recommended."
2,Surface did not hold up very well,"I've been very pleased with Calphalon products in the past, but the non-stick surface on this pan did not hold up very well. Minor scrapes have expanded and cause food to get stuck in the cracks. Also, it's warped and does not heat evenly on our electric burner. I purchased a 10 inch pan at the same time and it is very good - no issues. Maybe this is just a cheap model."
2,Top leather scuffed on first wear,"The shoes look and wear great. However, the leather is pretty weak. I think I must have kicked a table leg or something on my frist outing in them. Now the tip of my left shoe has a quarter-size scuff on it. I will have to try to cover it up by oiling it. Obviously I don't think this pair will last long at all."
3,Two years and the leather tore due wear,"Fine pair of shoes. But doesnt last much beyond 2 years. On my pair, purchased in April 2009, the leather has cracked and torn right at the stitching. The leather seems weak. To be fair I have another pair of Skechers bought the same time and the leather is fantastic. No tears or separation. So possibly just a one-off."
2,Skechers Men's Examiner,"Feels VERY MUCH NARROWER than the Skechers that I wanted to replace (I wore them so often that they were just hanging together). Maybe Skecher is using a different last now, but if your old medium width feels good order a wide."
3,Skechers were great. Expected delivery date incorrect.,"When I recieved the Skecher shoes they were great, but for some reason the expected delivery dates were incorrect. On amazon.com I was told to expect my shipment by August 28th. When I did not recieve the shoes by that date, I emailed Bealls in Florida and was told that my shipment was on schedule and would be delivered by August 31st. I'm unsure why Bealls was unaware that the expected delivery date on amazon.com was different than what they emailed to me, but I would recommend that Bealls consider that when responding to future customers. I'm unsure whether I will purchase from Bealls again."
4,Book Review,"Book arrived promptly in excellent condition, however it's a library book. I wasn't sure what to think about that."
4,Book II is riveting.,"It's not often that I can read a book whose characters are not really loveable, or in some cases even likeable, and yet find myself glued to the pages. Well, the tablet screen anyway. Erikson weaves a VERY complex tale of magic, moral's and gore, and does it in such a way that I became spellbound. A worthy successor to book I in all ways, and a harbinger of book III. THIS is a page turner. You will follow several people, in different locations and circumstances. I marveled at how they survived and I was intrigued at how their stories, though disparate, could be seen to be weaving toward a similar goal. Excellent."
5,excellent,"Best book I ha've read in a while. Erikson spins an engrossing, exciting tale. Ready for next in series. get it"
5,Hundreds of pages of pure pleasure,"Brilliant characters. Tons of unexpected moments and twists in the plot. Impossible to say which is good and bad side. No clear definition. The line is blurred.Once again, the scope of the world is mind boggling.9.5 /100.5 star off because too many details for each battle. Not the gore part but the actual technical details. I would settle for more general approach to the battles.Otherwise fantastic book."
2,My dog will not eat these,"They may be good, I really don't know because I guess my dog found the taste unpleasing, and would not eat them."
2,My Crazy Pups,"One of my Westies has coprophagia and apparently the peanut butter flavor did not digest. Trouble!! My other Westie is a picky eater and will have nothing to do with the biscuit. All is not lost, my son's Westie needs them and loves them. They may be the right thing for some dogs, but not for my crazy dogs."
4,A concise and helpful language guide for Cantonese,"This was one of my primary resources for a 10 day trip to Hong Kong. I am lucky to have 'an ear' for the tones of Chinese languages, but this book helped to provide me with enough vocabulary to communicate in simple Cantonese and be understood. You should understand that the Cantonese speaking regions of China are a madhouse mix of languages and accents, and if an elder Hokkienese speaker doesn't understand your mangled ""Guangdonghua"" it's not the book's fault, it's just part of being in China. :-)Overall a very helpful resource at a good price, fairly durable and fit easily into a hip pocket or belt-pack."
5,An AWAIR Pick!!!,"Fabulous collection of short stories centering on the lives of Muslims in urban America. A poetic journey to understand the phenomenon of cultural and spiritual transplantation from the perspective of American Muslim voices. Through ten stories, these voices emerge from all corners of the Muslim-American experience to articulate struggles, remembrances, fears, and dreams.Teachers/Librarians: 8th grade to adult. This would be an excellent class read in your language arts program - order enough for a class set! If you were present at one of my teacher workshops in the 1990s you probably heard me read one of these stories aloud to ""the class"". . . about what a mother would like her daughter's teacher to know?"
3,"Flag OK, grommet not.",The grommet on the bottom of the flag came out the first time I put the flag up. Otherwise OK.
2,Schindler's list,I think that Schindler's list was hard to follow and understand. There were two many German words and too many different characters just there for one chapter and you didn't know who they were or what they were like. The names I couldn't pronounce but the least they could do is change the unimportant characters' names to how it would be pronounced. I think the overall story was too realistic for example it was using all the stuff that you would not even have heard of today only my grandmother would still use them that if she was from Germany (Which she isn't).
5,Avid Reader,Insight to another historical event of evil and what evil can do to others. There are many things to learn from this book. I recommend reading this book.
4,works well,works well no complaints. havent had any check engine light or anything like that so i guess it is making a good seal.
5,Excellent,"This is the best product of its kind that I have found. It is very functional, but not greasy like some of the others. It last for hours while in the saddle, but washes away easily after the ride. The small one ounce pouches are very handy when you are away from home."
5,Saved my you-know-what on many a long ride!,"The product works as mentioned. I used this on a bike tour in severe heat, for many days, and it helped a lot!"
3,Doesn't cut it if you are prone to chafing...,"I tend to chafe pretty quickly on a road bike, despite investing in good bike shorts, a women's specific saddle, and only being on the bike 20-30 miles at a time (hilly, usually, but still not very long!). Chamois Butt'r creme just didn't cut it for me. Despite slathering it on, I still occasionally got hot spots after an hour or so on the bike, especially on hilly rides or in hot weather. I also dislike that it is petroleum based and contains synthetic ingredients - not what I want to be regularly applying to my nether regions! I switched toDoc's All Natural Chamois Creamand I'm much happier with it - no more chafing!"
3,Smelly,"Maybe this works, but for me it has a strange smell and unfortunately, I am a bit sensitive to smells, so I guess I'll have to find someone to give it to who isn't."
2,lost somewhere,"Ummmm...this is the type of music my brother would listen to. I was browseing in the industrial section, really, this is a pitiful excuse for that. This is like the orphaned child of metal, alternative and industrial, a drifter in an uncomfortable state of inbetween....not very good. His voice would be better suited to something more along the lines of alice in chains...i suppose... well? i don't think it should be this high on the list.....i guess it is all supply and demand...talent being an outdated and irrelevant factor."
5,best test light I ever used,"A major time saver and a must for 5 volt reference circuits map sensors, speed sensors etc, yellow light comes on in 5 volt circuits fantastic ( sst wont do this), blinks when a signal circuit is active. Outstanding for checking speaker wires for opens or shorts to ground. the sst is a great test light I never use it anymore since I purchased this one."
1,lemon maker,It writes very well but very much useless afterall. I might have gotten a lemon. Tech service very unfriendly and unhelpful. At least I got the case so that I can put different drive in it. I used Pioneer A2(dead now) and Plexter but neither had trouble. I bought this because it was cheap after rebate but I did not even get the rebate yet almost a year after I sent my form. Go figure.
1,cool blue ligth,"The light last longer as 3 months on my truck(that's the first time lights blow so fast),quality was not that good clear focus about 10/100 more.I did purchase a pair of those and just blow on my truck and the ligths is not on all the time so i just use during night drive and rain time so was not realy 3 months or 2.000 hours, so I do not recomend the produt.Keep the regular GE is less expensive and go more hours."
5,Thanks.,Shipped promptly...just as said. Was sent as a gift to the inmates of Vigo County Jail because it was requested and they are seriously lacking in their literature selections since they have done away with the library program.
5,Get sucked into the realm of Albion... long to stay forever.,"Many years have passed since I have read a book soenthralling - so enchanting that this world seemed to slipaway and become insignificant. The imagination takes over asthe plot weaves a poignant story filled with battle andlove, greed and honor, beauty and friendship. The charactersare so lifelike and flawed that at times your brain screamsto lead them in paths you know they won't follow.This simple, science fiction book has challenged mystandards of honesty, beauty, and compassion, and I onlywish that I had never read this book so that I couldexperience it for the first time again."
5,Continues to satisfy.,"So many times a sequel doesn't satisfy, but this one does. Lawhead's story is interesting and exciting, and extremely well-written. I'm learning a lot about ancient celtic culture, too. He's done his research well."
2,It's missing the opening and ending credits!,"Nine Inch Nails: Closer (precursor)...from the Further Away/Closer to God CD-single. Featured in the film during the opening credits...best possible choice for the movie. David Bowie: The Heart's Filthy Lesson...from the Outside album. Featured in the end credits...best possible choice for the movie. Neither of these two songs are on the soundtrack CD...why not?! As good as the rest of the music is, without these two songs, how can you dare buy this album?!"
1,This is what you want...this is what you DON'T get!,"I agree with all those above who were disappointed and chose not to purchase it. What's the deal? I was mortified that not even Bowie's great tune at the end credits isn't even there.Don't get me wrong, I love Billie Holiday and the rest of those old timers, some living and some no longer with us, but this is just [bad]. Forgive my blatantness but where could all of us maybe find the songs we want to hear from the movie??"
3,too much,"Book is OK but some information could be harmful to apply - especially to younger children. Besides, why would anyone pay $191 for these tapes when you can buy them at www.bullies2buddies.com/audiotape/intex.html for $20 plus shipping and handling?"
2,This Book Not for the Amatuer,"Nice plans, but little instruction. Could benefit from pictures of more modest dwellings and projects more suited to the regular homeowner.A good supplement to other, more detailed books, but unless you are an accomplished carpenter, don't make this your only book."
1,only 1!,i am not reading this book because i read books that are liked by many others.... this only has 1 reveiw! i neaded a biography for ela in school but i guess that i am not doing this book for my biography in school.
4,Get the Audio!,"I don't usually listen to books, but I bought this for an upcoming road trip. Since so much of the book is oral, there is speech therapy, singing, attempting to speak French, it is wonderful to listen to the author's actual voice."
3,"Well, not exactly 'Wildy etertaining'",'Wildly entertaining' is the Christian Science Monitor reviewl. I thought the first half was very entertaining though the humor began to get old after reading the same style over and over again. The second section tailed off quite a bit and got rather morose and uninteresting.
4,Not as funny as DRESS YOUR FAMILY but funny still!,"I really enjoy listening to David Sedaris and consequently I really enjoy this book-on-CD, however, I find that the collection of stories -- while varied -- are not as uniformly funny as found in DRESS YOUR FAMILY IN CORDUROY AND DENIM, which I find much more uniformly funny. That said, there's quite a few gems on ME TALK PRETTY ONE DAY! A must for any Sedaris fan."
4,Refreshingly Humorous,"While ""Me Talk..."" is no ""Naked"", it still hits a solid home run in the humor department. You won't find yourself rolling on the ground with laughter like you did with ""Naked"", but you'll certainly turn many heads with your belly laughs while reading this book in public. If you're looking for another funny read by Mr. Sedaris, pick up this book and you won't be disappointed."
4,"A bit inconsistent, but the payoff is worth it","My reactions to David Sedaris's new book ranged from a slight smile, to such hysterical laughter that I was asked to leave the ICU of a hospital where I was visiting a relative.The book is split into two parts. The first is made up of stories about his family, including his foul-mouthed but tender brother, and his father, who apparently will eat no food before its time.The second half concerns his life in France, especially his attempts to learn the language. A million writers have used this theme before, but I've never read anyone who does it so well. The short dialogue of cowed language students trying to comfort each other before their teacher attacks again is worth the price of the book.I highly recommend it."
1,Self indulgent and annoying beyond tolerance ZERO STARS,"...Funny? When did cynicism and ...arrogance displace wit and insight in American comedy? If you think insulting anyone around is a sign of wit you have found your bible. A weak author, without charm or grasp of the language.If airing the intimacies of family and friends in an insulting and exploitative way is your description of charm then get ready to be smitten. It'll make a good read in between episodes of Temptation Island and American Idol..."
5,"My first Sedaris, won't be my last!","This is the first David Sedaris book I've read, and I will definitely be reading more! I laughed out loud in every chapter, but his satire is not overbearing. His way with words and his quirky way of thinking about ordinary life situations borders on genius (despite the results of his IQ test!) Highly recommended!"
2,Dull,"A collection of autobiographical essays by Sedaris which appeared in different magazines before being collected here. Neither funny, nor witty, this makes for very light and insipid reading. I'd rather read Donald E. Westlake or Dave Barry for my humour supply."
1,Not worth the paper its printed on.,"Based on the reviews of this book, and reviews I have read on other books recommending this particular book, I was really expecting it to be incredibly funny. There wasn't a single thing I found funny in this book. Not even a chuckle. I kept reading expecting for it to possibly pick up, after 100+ pages I realized no such luck. I began to just skim the book, because after all I paid for it. This book had NO point at all. It just sort of rambled on about nothing. Sedaris is SO not funny. The writing is flat. I would not recommend this book to anyone and if I could give it 0 stars, I would. Its not worth the paper its printed on. I am still annoyed I spent money on this, everyone that bought it deserves a refund."
2,Proves that anyone can write a book these days!,"Sedaris is a talented writer; he has good sentence structure and uses creative analogies to bring across his humor. Although I am impressed by his ability to be funny in writing, I wasn't at all tempted to laugh out loud (as other review writer have said). It's not THAT funny.What I find disappointing about the book is not the writing itself, but the writer and the content. His life is not all that different from the average American. Yes, his experiences in France are beyond that of what most of us accomplish in our lives, but then just write about France and leave out the whole childhood bit; it's no more interesting than anyone else's."
2,Not what I had hoped for,"Firstly, let me state that I did NOT finish this book. The reason being is that after reading all the hype surrounding this book, I had high expectations of the humour and writing.....and after trying to read around 4-5 chapters, I found myself not agreeing with the hype. Maybe if all the chapters had flowed as one continuous story it may have held my attention more. I just couldn't get into the whole story despite desperately wanting to enjoy this. And I didn't find it as funny as everyone else had spoken about, so this compounded my exasperation with this book. Maybe I will come back to it another time, when really desperate."
2,Me Disappointed,"As someone who experienced big belly laughs with Naked and Barrel Fever, I anxiously awaited the release of MTPOD.Outrageously insane insights and POV. Interesting characters. The problem with MTPOD...the stories are simply not that funny. A handful of laughs, one or two chuckles.My recommendation...reread Naked."
5,clever new humor,I loved this book... it got me started reading david sedaris and amy sedaris. I even saw him at a live reading and it was fantastic!
1,Why? Why? Why bother reading another book by this author?,"This book isn't funny. Talking about taking drugs, your horrible careers, dead pets and making fun of children is not funny.The writing is not very juicy either. Any one of you reading this could write a better book.The good part is, the writer seemed to have trouble meeting the minimal word limit so the reader can finish reading the book rather quickly because there is not much to it.The reviews on the cover must be for marketing purposes. If you really are curious about reading it, barrow the book from a friend or buy it when it gets to the Dollar Store.It's horrible!!!"
2,Is he always this weird?,"This is the first book I've read from David Sedaris. Sedaris tells some interesting stories, but be warned that they are all a little weird for a small town girl. His family seems to enjoy making each other crazy and/or grossing each other out far too much. Some of his essays are enjoyable reads, but the chapter on his brother was made up entirely up the 'f' word in all it's gloified variations. This is good writing? And, by the way, while some of Me Talk Pretty is good, none of it is laugh-out-loud funny as the jacket describes."
1,"Overrated, thank you","Sorry, but I had high hopes after reading all the positive reviews for this book. My boyfriend and I bought the audio and played it on a recent trip. I remember giggling once, sort of. What's the deal -- hilarious? What am I missing? It's not that it was horrible, it's just that it was flat -- purported to be funny, but to me a real disappointment. Maybe it picked up after the first two tapes, but we couldn't sit through any more than that."
4,Why Isn't My Life This Exciting?,"Something must have been in the drinking water at the Sedaris' home some years ago. Although we all have family/life stories to share, most of ours are nothing like David's. His comic bathroom struggle to dispose of an un-claimed... out of fear that the next in line will believe it to be his, is hi-LAR-ious! I like the way that David views life."
4,Laughed (...)off,"Few books can make me laugh out loud (WARNING: do NOT read this in the library's ""Quiet Room""; you will not be able to hold it back and may burst at the seams), but this one succeeded. The only thing better than reading this book is listening to it on CD as Sedaris himself reads from the pages. His comical high pitched voice and impeccable sense of comedic timing works on so many levels, you gotta hear him deliver the lines himself. I would give the audio version 5 stars because it is funnier to hear it rather than read it but still this book delivers! Read it and laugh (...)!"
1,Did we read the same book?,"I picked this book up expecting a good read based on it's best seller status, I was mistaken. This entire book is nothing more then the stupid ramblings of an Idiot. Don't waste your money."
2,Not gripping,The first chapter of this book is very good.The later chapters like the vicars egg are good in parts .I must admitt I laughed out loud at times but as the book went on I found it less and less likely to be accurate . Having learnt various foreign languages in difficult circumstances I found this chapter particularly unlikely .I finished the book as it is on my book club list but I was sorely tempted to give up two thirds of the way through . I will sadly not be reading any more books by this author .
4,"Thank you, David Sedaris!","With sardonic wit and an eye for the absurd, David Sedaris gives hyperbolic treatment and philosophical consideration to what would otherwise be a mundane life. And just when it seems that his aresenal of experiences is depleted, he invites us to witness from the perspective of his unfettered imagnination. We oblige, of course, because by now this neurotic maladroit is our friend, his fantasies of being a celebrated and sought-after hero are our own, and we are more like him than we ever dared to admit."
3,Not as funny as his stand up,"I love David Sedaris, but I did not find this book very amusing at all. I actually can barely get through it. I started it a few months ago. He is much funnier in person and I will never buy one of his books again."
5,Warning: do not read this book next to a sleeping partner,"Hysterical is the best word to describe this book. If you know anything about elementary school or speech class do yourself a favor and read the first story, ""Go Carolina""....you'll be hooked. Humor is difficult to write and Sedaris is a master. Loved the midget guitar teacher and the IQ equivalent to the weight of an average housecat.....haha. Every ESL teacher ought to have ""Make That A Double"" and ""The City of Light in the Dark"" as required reading. Anyone who has learned a new language and had the frustrating experience of being adequate, semi-intelligent, in their native language, while sounding like a three year old in the new language, will enjoy Sedaris's descriptions of learning French. I did have to close the book when my husband fell asleep because I could not contain my laughter."
4,ha.,"better than his other books. i thought naked was boring and weird, a little self indulgent. this is really funny and interesting. stories about his dad are both funny and touching, and the essay about his brother the rooster is classic. check it out."
2,A little too liberal for me,"I'm new to this author and thought he would be funny, but found it to be a little too liberal for my taste. I got through the first few chapters, then donated it. It wasn't for me - I'm a little too conservative, I think. If you don't mind potty humor, this book may be good for you."
1,Not funny. Irritating with a strong mix of boring.,"Bought this book because 900 reviews suggested this book could be hilarious. I found David Sedaris after reading all of Augusten Burroughs books (HIGHLY recommend!). He was frequently compared to Sedaris.The difference being that Burroughs is actually funny and Sedaris is, quite simply, not. In this book, the chapters are broken down into what are like mini-stories. They don't even seem like they TRY to be funny. You find yourself flipping page after page hoping that there will be some kind of redemption for the 15 pages you just read to find out that the conclusion is just as blatantly boring as the beginning and middle.It sucks that I spent $10 on a piece of literature I cannot and will not finish. It should be like other products- returnable (I bought it in Kindle form.)Save your money and your brain cells- read Augusten Burroughs train-wreck literature if your looking for a humorous read."
5,David Sedaris is great fun,"David Sedaris has some great stories to tell, from his encounter with his speech therapist in grade school to being called a ""dirty froggy"" on the Paris Metro. If you are literate and you obviously are because you are reading this, click the button that says ""BUY"" now. You won't regret it. (Plus having this book in your collection will impress your indie friends)."
1,Glad I'm not the only one,"After reading the rave reviews in the front of the book, and then the glowing reviews on here, I thought I was in for a treat, especially since I love humorous books. Unfortunately, this humor wasn't for me. I found the writing self-absorbed and tedious. I didn't need to find a private place to read it since I didn't laugh out loud once. I struggled to get to the end. The first chapters were mildly amusing, but it was a slow tortuous roll downhill after that. To compare this to the writings of Mark Twain is to gravely insult Mr. Twain. Luckily, everyone has different tastes and different things tickle different funny bones, but my funny bone remained untouched by this collection."
2,Really not that funny,"I'm not without humour however, I do know humour. This book simply leaves something to be desired. Its not terrible but more importantly, its not that great. It has been touted as laugh out loud funny, but it lacks the ability to, in most places, crack a smile. Don't waste your time or prepare yourself for a dissapointment. If you lower your expectations then you can be better prepared for ""laugh inside, without smiling"" funny."
2,Meh,"Yes, this book is undeniably funny. However, it's the literary equivalent of Doritos (ie: Pretty good, but leaves you hungry. And too much will make you feel vaguely ill.) Borrow it and bust a gut laughing for an afternoon. But don't spend your own money on it, because the vignettes become increasingly stale and vacuous with successive re-readings. Anyway, in a few years you'll be able to find this book for cheap in bookstores' remainder bins, along with Tama Janowitz and David Foster Wallace novels."
5,Discovered a new favorite author,"Though I didn't find it laugh out loud hilarious, the stories in this book were all very entertaining and amusing in a snickering sort of way. Sedaris's family seems to be full of some unique and strange characters, and his accounts of his and their exploits are well delivered. I plan to try his other books."
3,A Practical Guide for Beginer,"It basically introduces you to a lot of the topics, gives you an example, but does not cover much details. For instance, it tells you what LDAP is and how to get/install it. It gives you a simple example of how LDAP works but does not cover much of anything else.DEFINITELY NOT FOR ADMINISTRATORS."
4,good reference.,Well written and pretty thorough. It was what I had hoped for. Good reference if you are getting into the Raspberry Pi computer.
3,Lower your expectations,"I agree with the reviewer who said this book was a disappointment. The editors should be smacked for including all of those horrid b&w photos. As someone who was looking for help identifying Nancy Ann dolls and could have really used this book, it was a great disappointment because of the photos."
3,Nancy Ann Storybook Doll first book,"There are later, more comprehensive books on the subject but this was the first. I spent hours and hours reading this, and marking it up with comments when it came out in 1980. The pictures are black and white, which isn't too helpful in identification, but the late Marj Miller poured her heart and her knowledge into this book."
1,What a dumb-ass!!,"Really, how do guys like this think (?) and walk at the same time? This book is for Fox News sound bite freaks; no in depth stuff here. He goes for gut reactions with no insight or depth beyond the width of a piece of paper. Wave that flag somewhere else, pal...oh yeah...and try top learn to read something beyond right wing publications for your background. A Nazi wrapped in an American flag...."
3,Where's the Sketch Comedy?,"Tenacious D's first album was peppered with sketch comedy routines, but in ""The Pick of Destiny"" Tenacious D eschews their signature sketch comedy in favor of a completely music-driven comedy album. For some, this is a welcome change, but I thought that the non-musical ""Inward Singing"" and ""Karate Schnitzel"" were some of the best parts of their original album. I understand that this is a soundtrack, but maybe they could have included more scenes from the movie to make up for the missing sketches.What sets Tenacious D apart from other bands in the joke-rock genre is that, stylistically speaking, ""The D"" is actually a really good band. Their musical style runs the gamut from classic 70's rock, to the arena rock of the 80's, to modern metal."
3,Cos its the Pick!....,"Good album with some great tracks. Not as good as the first album which had a great variety of songs. The songs on this album are direct from the movie, so if you havent seen the movie, it will all sound a bit odd."
5,Great hilarious music!!!,"Great rock music with comedy. Being the clean version, the vulgar words that are omitted and substituted with other rhyming words are quite funny. However, some people may still find it offensive. Use of words like ""mother trucker"" or ""mother hubber"" for substitution, ""buck it"", etc....If you love Jack Black, have a great sense of humor and can accept the rhyming replacements, then this album is worth a look."
2,Pretty disappointing,"What a let down. Only a couple of the songs are good and the rest is filler. I expected much better than this from the greatest rock band on earth. Where the hell is Kage on this album??? D, you really f'd up on this one. I was going to go see the movie but after this rip-off I'll pass.I've been jamming the D since the HBO days. I'm going to have to go back to what the crusty record store owner told the D. ""Let the dream die."". Because if this is what passes for the rock then ""rock and roll is bogus""."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS VIDEO FOR TODDLERS!!!,"This has to be the WORST disney movie I have seen. My three year old begged for weeks for this christmas movie after being marketed by Disney in previews during the first Beauty in the Beast (special edition.) This movie is DARK and scary. I did not see anything about the christmas spirit except they finally get a tree in the end. The movie has a demented organ that sings about love being hateful, and oh yes and the song has the word ""hell"" in it. I could not believe it. Then Belle almost dies in a frozen lake and is then locked up in the basement prison by the beast. Happy Holidays!!! Too bad I can't give it zero stars."
2,Looks good. Creaky story. Thankfully short.,"This sequel has the original voices, some new characters, and some substandard songs. It's OK for the sprogs, but is only about 25% as good as the original. Unsurprisingly, the attempt to squeeze and entire new story into the confines of the original is not a success."
2,dvd,"the dvd did not work,got it for my little grand-daighter and she was very upset when she could not watch it,not sure I will buy from them again,for the price it should of I think"
3,Disappointed,"I find this movie kinda of boring, which totally disappointed me, since Beauty and the Beast is one of my favorite Disney movies!"
2,disappointed,The dvd stops or freezes up multiple times which makes you miss parts of the movie. I purchased this for my 3 yr old daughter to watch. But with it freezing up constantly she is just not going to wait to watch it.
1,this is almost an horror movie for a 5 years old!,"I don,t know why waltdisney include more and more scary part in their movie. I do not beleive this is appropriate for children in young age. More and more desappointing purchase.I don,t know why would they make so terrible story!they used to be so good!less than one star"
5,It is great for everyone!,"If you like Beauty and the Beast, you'll like this too. Everyone has the same voices except Chip and it's a holiday classic. I have it and I love it!"
4,The Enchantment,"Starring a new set of characters, Fife, a cute little piccolo, and Forte, a pipe organ (voiced-over by none other than TIM CURRY!), and Angelique, a cute ""decorater"" angel, it's just as good as the original with an air of Christmas.Forte sort of frightens me with the way he was drawn, but since it's Tim Curry that voiced-over it, I'm as happy as a lark.The mischievousness of the ""evil"" characters, Forte and Fife, is appealing, and it is lively and enjoyable. However, the living version fo Forte instead of the pipe organ, is horribly creepy looking.Belle's ambitions to make Christmas happen make this a great movie and defitely worth seeing. I highly recommend it."
2,"Ugh, really?","My daughter loves Belle, so of course we had to get this movie. Though it was nice to hear the original voice cast, the songs were so bland and horrible. I want my money back."
5,Imagine!,The story of pictures coming to life is made original through morphing from pictures to students. The pictures of the children's pets hold class during the night. A great catalyst for a child's imagination while allowing reading to be fun and interesting. A clever worthwhile book and tool.
1,Wrong product in picture,"This is the older product in the picture, which is better, that has been replaced by a cornstarch powder. It is misleading."
2,"Leaky packaging, burns the skin","The roll on container leaked the contents, was leaking when I opened it. I did try the product anyway, just rolled in on, didn't rub or massage on. It burned my skin immediately, got all red and welty. I will try DMSO again. I liked the concept of easy application, but this kind isn't it!"
5,"nice, easy reading","VEry informative!!! It reads well, easy to understand book about the realities of the craft. And a very positive one, at that! I have read through the book a few times, and know that i will read it again."
2,Tedious and Distasteful,"As a fan of great historical fiction (e.g. anything by Dorothy Dunnett, Eco, Anya Seton), I had high hopes for this book. Alas. The writing here, while noble for a first effort, is ultimately mediocre, the plot obvious and distasteful."
2,Unengaging,"This book is like a cheap paper back 15th Century travel guide. ""Pilgrimages on $15 dollars a day or less"". It was uneventful. The characters while well crafted held no emotional connection for the reader to identify with. It seems as if there is some suspense getting into the story but this promise quickly dissipates and we are dragged endlessly towards a conclusion that by this point no one cares about. The historical accuracy and research is notable, but for a work of fiction that sells itself as a mystery/suspense it fails."
1,Wrong Description,"The product description states:Also Compatible with Nintendo DS, Game Boy Advance and Game Boy Advance SPDetachable USB adapter allows you to charge and play from any device with a USB portLED light keychain provides extra illumination where you need it and keeps your USB adapter close at handKeep playing your favorite handheld games even when you run out of battery powerCar charger with 6 feet cord lets you charge and play your handheld while you ride in the car--------------------------------------------------------------------------------There WAS NOT the USB adapter, not the LED Light Keychain, or car charger as stated. So very misleading."
1,Will not fit properly ...,"Much like Glen Dudley, the InvisiShield was too large to fit into the DS Lite screen. I replaced the screen shield several times attempting to make it fit correctly and it simply doesn't. This creates a long airbubble on the side of the screen where the shield doesn't contact the screen because it's held away from it by the raised edge around the screen ... and it's not as if I didn't get the protector flush up against the edge. I did. Several times. And my boyfriend did, as well. It just wasn't going to fit.Not worth the price for working as poorly as it did."
5,Amazing,"The screen protectors are amazing! There was only 1 air bubble I had to push out. I started with the top screen so I wouldn't mess up on the bottom screen. After putting them on, you can't even see that they're there!"
3,Invisi-Shield,I bought this for my daughters new DS for Christmas. They are not the easiest to put on and you must make sure your screen is 100% clean. Even the tiniest bit of dust will stick and be there forever. These are hard to remove if it is possible to remove at all...I could not get mine off at all to reclean the screen and reapply.
1,Too thick,The screen protectors are too thick. I had to take it off the bottom screen cause it made the touch screen not work.
5,18/10 at a great price.,Bought these for my wife and she loves them. I can't believe all that you get for the money. Complements all the time.
3,Average,Another movie for tommy lee jones to be tommy lee jones! Didn't recognize lee ving till I saw the credits!
2,Time filler,"This Tommy Lee movie is not typical of his normal filling of his character with interest and excitement. He is usually a unique reaction to the circumstances of the story, but this one is just so-so an only slightly amusing for real Tommy Lee fans, but still worth watching."
2,not a quality product,"I am not happy with this product at all, the quality is not what you have in mind also its very very uncomfortable ."
4,Need some extra care and feeding,"I've used these lights for many years now. As a musician, I found them invaluable backstage to help get cables all hooked up in the dark. In fact, I had a blue and red one and I swapped the parts around. I've since lost one of them and now I have this hybrid red/blue light :)Anyhow, after a while, the threads start to get full of aluminum dust and debris and the o-rings need some lubrication (I've most recently tried some chapstick and it seems to work. I've noticed newer lights have some kind of oily material on them).I would like to see them offer a lght using 3V lithium cell technology and a brighter bulb with fewer dark spots."
2,Would have preferred the casing didn't come out when i increase the brightness.,"Thats how this works. You rotate the top portion around and the brightness and focal length increases. But then it comes off at the end. I read this about this product before, but its kind of annoying when you want to use this in a hurry and it becomes loose.Would have preferred a switch.Its quite compact and slips easily into your pocket. Would buy again from Maglite, but not the same design.Advice: look for something else, but make sure it doesnt operate the same way as this device."
5,NOTES FOR THE COLLECTOR OF MALE EROTICA,"This incredible photobook combines the PERFECTION of two remarkable Artists: Lukas Ridgestone's sculpting of his physique and Bel Ami's almost paranormal ability to capture the beauty of that physique in his Art. All of the photographs are in color and ALL of them are beautiful. Lukas expresses a ease, comfort and confidence with his body that raises the photography to a level of sensual wholesomeness...no self-hatred-expressed-as-erotica here, for a change. Bel Ami has a supernatural ability to capture Lukas as if Light was radiating out from within him, and several times as you turn the pages of this photobook you will be startled by the beauty and Artistry of these two men. More than highly recommended; if you were to purchase only one male photobook in your lifetime, this would be it."
4,Good cd,"This cd was set up nicely. Although there's only 5 different songs total, there's enough versions of them to make a 13 track remix album that leaves you pretty satisfied. Of course people might complain about the two remixes of ""Guilty"", (their trendiest song), but I like what Juno Reactor did with track 12. The utilized every part of the song except for the catchy chorus, forcing the listeners to focus on all the other parts of the song, like the rad guitar, and the overall speed of the song. If you want the trendy portion of the song, you'll find more of it in track 13, so don't worry. The three versions of ""Here"" are very good, and the Martin Atkins mix of ""Enough"" is a good reason to buy the cd. I would recommend buying this cd before the originals. It's always fun to hear the remixes first and work backwards."
4,Spies- Michael Frayn,"Spies is an assigned novel I have to study for English Literature at AS level.To be honest I agree with all reviews, good and bad.It is a beautiful book, but perhaps too poetic.I was extremely bored for the first few chapters, but as mentioned, once you get into it, it is very intriguing and cleverly written, and, I have to admit that Frayn is wonderful at capturing feelings of people.Although I agree with people dismissing it as boring and too poetic, which is what I thought to start off with, if you persevere with it you get to the ""good bits"".There's no written rule as to how long it's got to take to get into it, with Spies it just means you're more interested as the plot takes flight.A good book, but if your concentration span isn't great, it may take you a while.I think it's worth the buy but if you're not into stories that unravel in stages, it's probably not for you.In my opinion, good book :) well done Frayn!"
1,Spies,This is one of the worst World War II stories that I have every read. It is incoherent and makes little sense. It was totally a waste of money.
3,"off to a good start, fades","The beautiful, soft focus beginning of this book was perfectly wrought, and made me think this would be something special. Evidently, however, those were the last arrows the author had in his quiver. The rest of the book meanders at a slow pace, with little development and lots of innuendo. The suprises aren't so surprising. It becomes tedious rather than heartfelt. I rather thought this would be better done as novella or short short --it has a feel of being stretched. A for effort, C for execution."
2,Tedious,"I loved the atmosphere in the novel, to begin with, but by the time I'd read a third of it, I'd come to the conclusion that atmosphere is really all it has. There is some suspense, and I do still want to know how Keith's mother can apparently move very quickly between two places without being seen. However, the 'trick' was wearing a bit thin after about the third incident and the pages and pages of descriptive text eventually bored me, so I've decided life's too short and I've moved on to another book."
4,BETHANIA AT HER MOST THEATRICAL,"This 1974 work is one of Maria Bethania's most esoteric and theatrical ones.While the many songs are presented as in an asembly line without many interjections,the great chanteuse takes them beyond the imaginable.Blues,samba,bossa nova,even a homage to Carmen Miranda is featured.Songs penned by Jobim,Buarque and Vinicius are present.The only shortcoming of the CD version is that the tracks are not playable individually but in an amalgam fashion.Still a great gem and a milestone for the already glorious Bethania.I own it."
1,Not for me........,I bought this to try and cut costs from my normal vitamin. This did nothing for me. I felt totally fatigued and had little energy. I ended up going back to my more expensive vitamin and throwing the remaining pills in the garbage.
2,not pleased with taste or quantity,"Reference quantity, I knew I would need to take six/day. I live overseas and believe I need vitamin supplements. But I can't handle the taste. Once this month is over, I will go back to One-a-Day or Centrum. Hope you have more success with these."
2,Vitamins,When purchasing I was looking for a one a day multi vitamin. Well the reccommened dosage on these vitamins are 6 a day! I can barely remeber to take the one never mind 6 per day.
4,A fairly fascinating survival story against a swamp monster,A few books in this series still hold up remarkably well. One of the better premises for a GB book that I've seen. I remember the part where the two main characters hear the car driving away without them actually scared me as a kid. Think about it - being deserted by the only two adults who can help you? Plus the fact they were family and the kids trusted them. This book was actually pretty high quality even though I thought the ending was a little dumb.
4,Psychology of Ethics and Leadership,Excellent thought provoking work on ethics and leaders. The author uses a combination of case studies with historical works to outline the different facets of ethics. A must read for someone who is in process of designing a training program on ethics for a company or who is interested creating a code of ethics for an organization.
2,Just Plain No,"I had the opportunity to play Archibald Grosvenor for the Stanford Savoyards and was looking for a soundtrack mostly for nostaliga. I was deeply disappointed with this one, however. You can keep your historical value; this sounds like it was recorded on Edison's wax cylinder. Skip it and find another."
5,Grandson loves these!,"These lollipops are sweetened with sugar alcohols, which are not metabolized by oral bacteria, so they do not contribute to tooth decay. Excellent product!"
3,Intestinal complictaions?,"These are okay flavored. I see a lot of reports of intestinal problems from this product. When you eat these or any other sugar free item, moderation is the only answer. Sugar substitutes, especially malitol can really create intestinal challenges. For me, more than two at most will make me sick. For sugar free, these are not as sweet as other sugar free candies."
2,Not for the weak digestive tract!,"Being diabetic and also having had a colectomy (removal of 100% of my colon), I try to be mindful of what I eat. While these lolly pops have a fragrant fruity odor, they smell up a room (normal?). The taste is only ""okay"". That is not the worst of the problems I have encountered. My main problem is that it causes frequent copious immediate liquid evacuations. Sometimes they are accompanied by cramps. I cannot determine which chemical in the candy causes this.I will not purchase these again."
1,Not really Splenda...,"Rarely do we write reviews...but this product warrants it. These lollypops were listed as ""sweetened with Splenda,"" but be warned Splenda is the next to last ingredient in the product...translation: about three other sweeteners, all known to cause intestinal issues, are listed earlier. If you are looking for a treat that is actually sweetened with Splenda...this is not it!"
1,"Great Movie, lackluster DVD.","I have to join the chorus of others who deplore putting this out in full frame format. What makes it even worse is that the opening titles are letterboxed; then you go to full frame. The film is barely better than the old tapes, as the print used is lacking in sharpness and color saturation. This is, indeed, a modern classic, arguably Chevy Chase's best film ever, and quite funny to boot. It deserves much, much, MUCH better treatment!"
1,"Lame American ""comedy"". Not one funny moment.","""Vacation"" is nowhere near as senseless and moronic as Monty Python, but its humor is equally lame and unfunny. See a man drop something! harharhar See a man drive his car off the road! Yuckitie yuck yuck! See a cranky old lady and crude tweens! hahaha! See the wacky and zany Griswolds! <guffaw>! I never stop being amazed by the rancid dumpster-leavings that Hollywood can convince the American public to swallow, especially in the comedy genre. If only the Griswolds picked up the nation's # 1 Proust scholar somewhere along the road- he might have been able to teach them a thing or two about comedy."
5,Generation and Subgenre-Spanning Comedy Classic,"A brilliant comedic melting pot, mixing screenwriter John Hughes's heartfelt, vivid knowledge of life in the middle class with director Harold Ramis's biting sarcasm and National Lampoon's off-color brand of dirty humor. Chevy Chase is perfect as the everyman dad, easily his most identifiable role, who's out to show his family a good time come hell or high water on the mother of all bad road trips. The ensemble cast, speckled with cameos from several SCTV alums, elevates an already-rich premise into something even greater than the sum of its parts. Some of the puns are a dated product of the early 80s, but others are nothing short of timeless, and they all hit harder than an eighteen-wheeler. Legendary comedy from some of the best, I was wiping tears away during some of the best bits despite already knowing them by heart. Could've done with a less abrupt, bizarre finale but I can overlook that."
3,Great Movie. Bad DVD.,This is a great classic and my second favorite Chevy Chase film. European Vacation is my favorite but may be hard to relate to if you never visited Europe before 1980. Unfortunately the DVD version has been edited for political correctness. Part of the scene where they get lost and ask for directions has been deleted. Don't buy the DVD if you like original uncutversions of movies.
5,Capturing,This documentary was by far the BEST I've ever seen. I could not take my eyes off the screen. I have showed this DVD to many of my friends and several of them have placed thier own orders. It is a must see. I think everyone should have to watch this DVD at least once.
5,Great Movie,"This movie makes you realize just how horrifying 9/11 really was. I would recommend it to anyone over the age of 15. It's extremely intense, and sad."
5,The worst day in our history caught on tape,"When I first heard that this documentary was going to be on TV, I was very hesitant to watch it. I wanted to try and forget that tragic day in September. I decided to watch it anyway and i am very happy that I did. I realized that it is good to remember that day because we were all part of it and lived through it. I never saw the towers but when i watched this on TV it made me feel like I was down there when the towers were hit. This was the best documentaries that I have ever seen. I gave this 5 stars because i think that is awesome but also very sad. I believe that everybody that is looking for something to show their children about this day should get this dvd."
5,amazing,I wanted to have this amazing documentary for my children so they would have that eye-witness account of a terrible day in U.S. history. The dedication and bravery of the N.Y. firefighters is something everyone should witness and appreciate by watching this film.
5,Glad to Finally see this documentary released to the Public,"When I first saw commercials advertising this documentary about 9/11 on CBS, I was skeptical about it. I was concerned that it would be a documentary put together by a news agency that would over dramatize an already traumatic event. Instead it was a documentary created by two French filmmakers that were brothers who got caught up right in the middle of the events of 9/11. They were originally making a documentary about a probationary firefighter finding his place in the fire company he was assigned. While creating this documentary the events of 9/11 occurred and were captured in their documentary. This is the best account of the events that occurred on that tragic day, and if you have not seen it yet, I strongly encourage you to see it."
5,Best 9/11 Documentary,"This is by far the best documentary I have seen on 9/11. The scenes that are filmed inside the actual towers during the collapse are amazing, and the footage provides a fresh and new insight to the events.As someone who had family involved in the day, watching footage makes me sad, but seeing this documentary put a new perspective on what it was like to actually be there.What could never be said with words, is said with the film."
5,presley52,this documentry was awesome amazing footage from inside the first towers a must see.it shows how our bravest firemen went through inside tower one
2,The remote stinks,"The remote for this DVD player just stinks. The order of the important buttons is:[rewind] [fast-forward] [play][pause] [unimportant] [stop]In the dark its impossible to remember which is which, and you'll end up stopping, rewinding, or something else disruptive. The remote spoils the whole product, imo."
1,Iv'e had better material,"If you think of finding a solution on how to save your precious marriage with this book,i wont waste too much time on it giving it a thought! This is one of the books written from the authors point of view,and will make you feel guilty.from ALTER EGO in Tula OK"
5,In the Nick of Time,"I had been talking with a close friend and shared that my wife and I were contemplating divorce. He gave me a copy of this book and The Romantic's Guide and two months later, we are happier than newlyweds. We know a lot more about our needs than we did when we were married so this time we are going to keep the happiness in our relationship."
3,Good information but hard to read.,I found the information useful but if was bogged down and to wordy. The advise was so twisted and hard to recieve because of all the examples.
1,Hard or Soft? They felt the same.,"I bought one of each Soft, Medium and Hard Wedgie rubber picks and even though the colours were right, the Hard is as soft as the Soft. They felt exactly the same in fact. The Medium was the hardest out of the bunch.Packaging error? I have no idea. The fact that each stiffness only comes in one colour and the colours were right lead me to think something is wrong with the manufacturing. So check with what you get.Sound wise, the rubber really removes the treble on my acoustic guitar, making it sound really dull and muted.There is a lot more friction from the rubber on the strings that I do not think it is idea for strumming.The only reason I can think of using is if you want to reduce the noise but frankly, you would have much more control if you used your fingers instead."
3,slow shipping but good product,Product was exactly what I expected. The only thing I did not like was that the shipping took too long.
3,a good teacher helps...,"covers 75% of the detail and leaves the 25% up to you. it lacks clear explition is vector space secotion (row col vector nul basis etc). it seems like you do the first coumple of sections not understanding what you are getting at but when you get to chapter 6 or so the past stuff finaly makes sense. I found the book hard to understand when it was talking about maping, one to one on too. i suggest a TI-83 or higher and the solutions manual. The book also lacks pictures showing dimention row col nul basis etc."
1,This book sucks.,"By far the worst texbook that I have ever had the misfortune to be assigned. I had to drop the course because of it. The language requires a translator to interpret, the problems are presented in an unclear manner, and worst of all, you cannot verify whether your answers are correct, because the book tells you that you should already know them. Avoid this book at all costs. I recommend any book by Robert Busby."
5,McDonough's Narration Is Rich And Full Of Feeling For The Characters,"Narrator John McDonoughWhen you hear John McDonough's deep, growly voice, it seems immediately familiar.Listeners are drawn to the rich, warm tones of this veteran actor and singer.From Broadway to television and film, and from voice-overs to opera, McDonough's career encompasses the full gamut of acting experience.He has appeared with the Hartford Symphony and with the Glimmerglass Opera Company, and he is the Fox Family Channel's The All New Captain Kangaroo.As a narrator for Recorded Books, he has received wonderful reviews.Kliatt says,""MCDONOUGH'S NARRATION IS RICH AND FULL OF FEELING FOR THE CHARACTERS.""[from the back cover of case]"
3,It's OK,"The actors don't speak a word in all the soundtrack, but I wanted to see this old movie featuring Jorge Rivero."
4,Genuine Leather Case for Nikon Coolpix 5700,"The camera fits snugly inside the padded leather case. I slide the camera in backwards with the lens pointing up. The coiled camera strap fits alongside the lens. There is a zippered compartment in the front that will hold two spare batteries. Another zippered compartment in the lid will hold two spare memory cards. There is small mesh pocket on the lid that is good for temporarily storing the lens cap. The lid closes with an adjustable plastic buckle. If it's tightened all the way it slides over the sides with no gap. If the buckle is loosened there is a gap, but also enough extra room to allow the camera to fit with a lens attachment. The case comes with a strap and a belt loop. The belt loop doesn't look very substantial. I will be relying on the strap instead. The Nikon name is on the round plastic oval on the front of the bag. The camera fills the bag nicely so if you planned on hiding your lunch in there too you will be disappointed."
2,...little bag,Bit of a ... tatty little bag. When closed the top allows space around the sides for water/grit/gunge to get in. Not an appropriate bag for your expensive 5700. Try the Lowepro range instead - altogether a better class of bag.
4,great camera case,"I was looking for a case to hold my Nikon 5700 - nothing bulky, just something that would offer some protection while dragging it around on vacation. This case fits the bill. It is a nice quality leather - and holds the camera snuggly. If I HAD to find something that wasn't perfect with this case, it would be that the camera strap (the one that same with my 5700) doesn't fit as nicely in the case as I'd like it to. It takes a bit of arranging, but it does fit. This is really such a non-issue, but I wanted to mention it. I will keep my camera in this case within my larger multi-camera bag for home storage and for travelling on the airplane (where my charger and tipod are kept).This small case is great for taking the camera out on day trips.And for such a great price - I HIGHLY recommend this to anyone."
2,Very Limited Performance,"I utilized the Scarecrow to keep my dog out of a rock garden area. Unless the dog is exactly in front of the unit and moving across, it does not activate. Even when her wagging tail is in front of the unit it does not activate. The degree of activation should be in the 45 degree range rather than in the 10 degree range. I have quit using it as it does not help."
4,Scarecrow bird deterent,"Product works as described, but isn't for larger birds, such as Blue Heron, which is eating fish in koi pond."
1,ok for a week,Sprinkler thing worked great for a week. Then quit. I still have to call the manufacturer. But kind of disappointing.
3,It works but...,The plastic hose connector could be problematic and leak water eventually. It deterred the dozen stray and neighbor cats before some how most of the cats magically disappeared.. but quality seems to be not good. Don't expect it would last long.
1,An expensive folly from an unhelpful company,"With great hope and ignoring the negative reviews I bought 3 to deter my two jack russells from a favorite activity: fence fighting withthe dog next door. I put them together and placed them as instructed ....and just as they warned on the directions, ""animals like cats... may cross under the senors."" My jacks can run to the fence faster than the 3 second delay so if the sensor sees them, they are already fighting. The burst of water is too short to be much of a deterent.Oh and that suggestion to ""call the company for help"" resulted in a young woman telling me that this was really made for deer, not dogs and that yes, I was right it wasn't working to deter my dogs. I asked if raising or lowering the scarecrow would help and she did not answer me even though I asked twice.I am glad this works for some folks but if you have short dogs rather than deer, be forewarned!"
2,Failed,"I have purchased two of the Scarecrows. The first one I bought and placed guarding my garden from a groundhog. It was doing a great job for a few weeks. I bought the second to cover the garden from two sides and would move them occasionally. I had to experiment with the water pressure to make sure both would go off. I the problem now is they have both stopped working. I have replaced the batteries, brought them in and cleaned them but still no luck.I'm not sure if it is coincidence but we had a group of bad storms last week with lot of lightning and both of these units have not worked since then. When it worked it did the job. But both units bought a few weeks apart are not working."
2,Good for five minutes,"I purchased the Scarecrow with the idea of scaring various critters filling my back yard with their piles. The motion sensor works as advertised; no problems. The issue is the intelligence of the racoons, skunks, opossum as they seem to like the sudden burst of water and are not frightened much.I have no deer in my yard, too urban, so I can't comment on scaring deer.I called in a wildlife service and caught an opossum, skunk and racoon on successive days. It was costing me a fortune however, so I cancelled their service.I have concluded the Scarecrow will be great for attracting young children to play with next summer. It is worthless scaring away animals however..."
1,sensor did not work,"The sensor just did not work. I used a new battery and hooked it up to the water hose, but it would not go, so I had to send it back but will try again."
1,does not work,"I bought this product to keep cats out of the vegetable garden. If you turn it to high sensitivity then it goes off when a car goes by, a tree limb blows in the breeze, etc. If you turn it down so it doesn't go off so easily, then it will not pick up an object as small as a cat. After try high, low, and all settings in between, I stopped using this product."
4,goodbye deer,"excellent- a very nice tool to get rid of deer, and other unwanted pests from your garden, could also include snoops around your house as well."
2,Contech CRO101 Scarecrow Motion Activated Sprinkler,"An interesting concept that works on larger animals, but doesn't seem to have the sensitivity to detect squirrels or chipmunks, my major antagonist. However, it does scare ME every time I forget it is armed and enter the garden!"
5,scarecrow motion sensor sprinkler,"Works great! No evidence of dogs or cats, even though I've seen them...if only it had a full 360 degree motion sensor... :)"
5,WORKS!,"Have tried this and Deer off and Sound sensor activated devices, along with ""Deer Fence"" This and Deer Fence are great. All put together, I am getting bothered the least in the neighborhood, although I have the best edibles."
4,Good and Easy to Install,"The product is easy to install and works great.I wish I could adjust the distance a little bit, but overall great product."
4,Works great on cats.,"I have an idiot neighbor that believes in the notion of ""outdoor cats"". Ever since I got this, no more dig marks in my landscaping! And no more having to run out the door with a spray bottle.The only reason I didnt give it the max amount of stars is because there were a couple times the sensor didn't work."
5,Protects our large garden and is entertaining!!,"Just received this sprinkler yesterday, so far we LOVE it. It covers our 450 sq ft garden perfectly and goes off whenever anyone even enters the back yard. We had problems with many cats thinking this big dirt area was THEIR cat box. Not Anymore!! Love that we didn't have to fence off the garden or put up electical wire again this season. Cats do NOT like the noise it makes, let alone that they will get wet if they set foot in the garden again."
4,Seems to do the job,"The motion-activated sprinkler works as described in the advertising. I have had no evidence of Blue Herons visiting my fishpond, as I had before. There has been some evidence of racoons messing about at the edge of the pond, but it looks as if they were only there briefly and knocked over a rock or a plant pot, but that's all.You are advised to move the sprinkler occasionally, so the animals won't just get used to it. I'm thinking about buying a couple more, putting them in series, and then leaving them without moving them, on the assumption that raccoons will get a blast from an unpredictable angle.Four out of five stars because it runs only on a battery and can't be hooked up to a permanent electrical wire, and because of the need to move it from time to time. But a worthwhile addition to my pond."
4,Scarecrow that shoots water,"So we stuck it in oour lawn facing our garden and had fun tresting it cuz we got ALL wet. We tossed the cats into the range too just to see if something smaller would set off the crow....YUP LOL. I just wish there was more sensing area (greater angle) so it would catch the critters (cats, birds, damn chickens) before the even got close to the garden. I still have to recultivate my garden and seed, that will be the true test. I sure hope the critters dont get use to it and come anyway, kind of like my rottweiler who loves to set it off and atck the water stream!She will chase it and try to drown in the stream. Maybe I'll buy one just for the dogs to play with in the hot Hawaii weather! OHHH i know I'll buy a third one to get the door solicitors too!!!!"
5,scarecrow motion activated sprinkler,the most effective and efficient way to keep deer off your garden. I have used them all and this seems to be the best and longest working way to keep the deer away. I have one at the front gate and it has kept the deer from coming in the yard since I activated it at the beginning of spring.
4,it's fun to watch the deer avoid our front yard,"I set up the Contech Scarecrow in our front yard, where daily many deer walk by. It's been effective in keeping deer from stopping in the yard in front of it, and I've even noticed that many of the deer now avoid that area. The big bucks usually just act irritated as they go through, but don't stop for long. So, it's been somewhat useful to keep the deer away, and certainly entertaining to watch. I'll get another one for our back yard next summer."
1,scarecrow malfunction,I bought this item and it worked for about an hour. After that the valve shut off about a half a second of duration which made the scarecrow just spurt a stream of water when it detected motion. Contacted contech's support : support@contech-inc.com and the never replied back. No support on their part. Returned the item. Will not buy a product through this company. Maybe because of the economy they went broke. Beware.
5,Super product,"I live in the woods sorta, where deer are constantly coming in eating my lillies, roses, just destroying my beautiful gardens and veggie gardens..When I heard about this product I had to try it..So far I still have my beautiful gardens. We can sit and watch the deer coming in but they don't go near my gardens.."
5,Saved my Tulip garden!,"The scarecrow is so easy to set up. Just hook it up to a water hose and let it do its job. I had trouble with critters digging up my bulbs and eating the baby greens. After I placed the scarecrow in the garden -- no more problems -- absolutely none. And its appearance is unobtrusive. Except for the garden hose, you wouldn't even know it was there."
1,No deterrent - Don't waste your money.,It does not deter deer. Within a day or two they are back eating your plants. Even two of the units directed on the area did not keep them away. They apparently get used to it and it does not bother them. I am now trying chemical deterrents (rotten egg and hot pepper based).
3,Sprays too high,"I bought this because I am having trouble with Raccoons tearing up my new sod in the backyard.However, even at it's lowest setting the water stream is too high. It's WAY over the heads of the raccoons.This thing would be perfect if it shot ""straight."" It would nail the raccoons directly.So I have to say that for me it doesn't work. My only success against my invaders has been to put down plastic mesh so that they can't pull the sod up."
5,Great Product,Length:: 0:09 MinsI was having problems with the cats getting in my vegetable garden. I purchased and installed this product and have not had any problems since. This sprinkler does what it says and I would highly recommend it. On the videos I am throwing a tennis ball in the garden and my dog is chasing it. You can see some videos of the sprinkler in action here:http://www.youtube.com/v/eBOuAP7XBUEhttp://www.youtube.com/v/uKKKYGtTX2M
5,Only effective product I've used!,"The great thing about this sprinkler is that it does exactly what it says it does: It keeps animals (deer in my case) far away! It even works when the battery dies! I found that after a few weeks of usage, the deer had altered the path they took near my home - I know this for sure after realizing I had a dead battery and nothing had been eaten. Don't waste you money & time with smelly sprays that don't work - get this asap!"
1,Not for chickens,I purchased the scarecrow hoping it would keep my chickens out of my garden. Either it doesn't see them or they just don't care. I imagine it could work for dogs or cats. I certainly got soaked several times trying to adjust the thing. The spray also malfunctioned and just made a serious little flood. I found the tiny piece that had shot itself out of the sprinkler head and corrected this but if I hadn't it's life span would have been about a week. I ended up just clipping chicken wings which seemed to have worked. duuuh. wish I would have thought of that sooner before the $60.00 sprinkler. I would still try this again for other problem critters.
3,Sprinkler,This sprinkler works well to keep our pets away from our garden area. The sensor needs to be kept clean or it won't work well.
2,Somewhat dissapointed so-far,"We've used it for about 2 months now. It seemed that it might have helped a bit with the Racoon issues we have. Sensitivity adjustment works, but trying to figure out the proper setting is tricky. Wind blowing things around can set it off. Had to tighten the hose at the bottom once. Looks like the vibration caused it to loosen up. Most dissapointing is that the battery went dead once already. If we end up having to replace the battery every 1+ month, that seems exessive..."
5,Functional and Fun,"We have woodchuck and bunny problems in our garden and this is a great way to keep them out and our lawn watered! Our dog will set it off and run like crazy so hubby gets wet, so we are having fun with it also! So far, our tomatoes and my flowers are looking much happier and healthier."
5,Racoons-be-gone,"My back yard was infested with racoons digging for grubs. Looked like someone had set-off a scatter bomb until I bought and installed the Contech Scarecrow Motion Activated Sprinkler. Within a few days, no more racoons. Very effective and safe method to rid your property of unwanted visitors."
5,Love it!,This is the second one we have purchased. It keeps the neighborhood cats from using our flower beds as a litterbox. The noise simply startles them while watering the flowers. We are also buying one for our vegetable garden.
2,Don't work!,"It worked for a week, then started shooting in one direction (the settings are correct), then just stopped working at all :-( Very disappointed!!"
5,Great Product,"Great product, easy to use, works really well -- keeps deer and my dog out of the garden. Deer had eaten the leaves off all my hosta's and since using the sprinkler, I now have my beautiful garden back!!! Had tried other remedies and nothing worked. This is a good natural way, good for the enviroment, no chemicals. Highly recommend."
1,Disappointed,Got this scarecrow to scare ducks and geese away. The ducks can land within 15 ft and the damn thing doesn't go off. When I run to chase them awat it squirts me. Real nice.
4,Great Product,"this is a terrific product, it scares me each time i forget that it is on, also scared my cat...the only down fall i would say about this is that there are times when it seems like the sensor is not working properly...sometimes its too sensitive and then its not at all."
4,Scarecrow Sprinkler Review,"The product is good in theory and actually works extremely well. I had a problem with racoons and opossums rolling up my newly laid sod; however, the only downside of the product is that I believe the animals get used to the spraying effect, even though there is an 8 second delay."
4,No More Cat Poo and Pee!,"Great product, it's been a month and the daily visits by multiple cats have gone to zero! It's all plastic so be careful setting it up. It took a week to figure out what would work best for me. I used teflon tape on every fitting but the water pressure was too high and the scarecrow would leak. I went to an RV supply store and bought a hose bib mounted water pressure regulator and bam... everything is working perfectly now. The pressure regulator is a must if the pressure is above 80psi. The pressure in now 60psi and it helps both the scarecrow and the hose it is attached to. The pressure regulator cost me about 15 dollars."
4,The Scarecrow works!,"I tried chemicals, granuals, noise makers, (all expensive), but could not keep a neighborhood cat from crapping next to my house. I stumbled on the ad for The Scarecrow and decided to give it a try. Wow, have had it in service for a month now and it works just great!! Not one catpoop yet. I dont think the lawn guys or the electric company meter reader like it very much, but oh well. Well worth the money."
3,contech scarecrow,"product is ok, racoons still find a way to get to my lawn, not sure how. seems as if they dont mind the water after learning what it is. also it goes off all the time for no reason when theirs no movement outside. product worked for maybe a week"
4,felix the cat {collectors edition},very enjoyable cartoon. expected it to have more shows on it. will keep in my collection.
4,"Felix The Cat, The Wonderful, Wonderful Cat!","Finally, the Felix cartoons from the fabulous 50s on DVD! There are 10 episodes on this DVD (which seem to have been culled from other sources) and they're a pretty good mix. There's the Professor, Rock Bottom, Poindexter, and the Master Cylinder (who was human once until he blew himself up - never knew that), but I wish they had included VaVoom! The production quality is very good, although the episode numbering is strange - as I said before they probably pulled these from VHS. There are episodes that number in the 20s yet there are only ten on the disc (with an 11th shown only if you get 8 or more trivia questions right)! In spite of some production issues, if you're a kid of the 60s that watched Felix along with Underdog, Gigantor, Speed Racer, Bullwinkle et al, pick this one up. Hopefully there will be more!!"
3,Good but...,"As someone who is beginning nursing school early next year, I looked forward to reading this book. Very informative, but I could do with the author's left-wing bias."
5,1 Quart serving bowl Rose Marie,5 stars here. This piece matches the rest of my Rose Marie set. As with prior pieces I reviewed...Kudos to Amazon for the 3 day shipping/free shipping/sale price and wonderful packing job that was done!!
5,"An instant classic, powerful, brilliant","Carter Burwell's work on this defines genius, the theme for Mel Gibson is filled with such self-confident swagger, and the action pieces are uniquely exciting.The real treat, though, is the overwhelmingly beautiful main theme. It only surfaces twice, briefly at the end of the title track, #4, but then it's there at the end, in track #15, ""Riding.""If anyone wants to know how you END a movie and a score, listen to this piece, THIS is how you do it. Sheer brilliance, and WHAT use of the full power of an orchestra, it's breathtaking."
2,"Doesn't have helpful ""help""",I've been trying all week to figure out how to get this program to put my show on a disk - any kind! It's been a totally frustrating effort; following all the cues both in the program and in the forums produced a show that I could only see on my computer that was about a 10th of the size of the recorded show and the graphics looked like I was using a Commodore 64 computer! I'm very disappointed with this software; upgrading from the Pro Platinum will cost $159; I'm hoping another program out there will show up that's more user friendly.
1,defective,i received a defective product sold by the seller. he or she must have knew it was broken because it was an open item.
2,Boring,"I spent $25.00 on a book whose author is not only impressed with his own intelligence, but who cannot even make it interesting. Big in scope, and at times, very well written, it is very hard to wade through a story where the reader is supposed to understand French, know the city of Paris as if they had been there numerous times, and try and understand page after page just what the author is actually trying to say by speaking through boring and troubled characters. A big waste of money and an even bigger waste of time."
4,Intermittently Wonderful,"Yes, you do need to know a little French, and you do need a vocabulary of a college grad, but no- this book is not pompous. Romantic? Yes. Grandious? Yes Occassionally tedious? Yes. Riveting? Often. Wonderfully coreographed? Absolutely,especially the set pieces whether it is a dinner party at a German estate or a war battle in Russia. I guess the thing I most liked about this book the most was that it painted a picture of pre- WWII Europe without inserting any late twentieth century sensebilities- excellent social and philisophical commentary. Well worth getting through the 775 pages. Only one unhappy note: it occassionaly degenerates to soap opera."
4,Cicada magazine,We gave this magazine as a gift to our granddaughter who will soon be 14. Our Library director recommended this magazine as suitable for gifted children who enjoy poetry. Our granddaughter writes her own poetry. She likes Cicada so much she asked us to renew it.
2,Hitchcock's Worst,"I have been a long time fan of this great master but these three films, by far, are not his best work. They seemed outdated, slow and boring. I was very disappointed with this DVD."
3,I didn't like them,I love Alfred Hitchcock movies but I didn't like these three. But that's just me. Other people might really like them. They are very old & slow.
4,Hitchcock's best British classic!,"THE LADY VANISHES is what I consider the best of Hitchcock before starting his career in Hollywood. The story starts out a little slow to make way for some character developement, but once things get rolling, it becomes a very mysterious thriller. I was very pleased with this Laserlight disc. The picture and sound quality is very good for the price. Of course I'm sure the Criterion release is far superior, but for the price, Laserlight gives you the most bang for the buck. Fans of Hitchock should definitely pick up this disc."
1,Hitchcock dumped on,"Do not spend your money on this supposedly superior edition of this great, classic Hitch flick on Criterion. For the price they are asking, better care should have been spent on the sound quality of one of the early masterpieces of the master of suspense. The sound is exactly the same as on my VHS version, varying between extreme shrill and loud sound and soft, incomprehensible sound. If the original sound source is so bad that no doctoring up will help, then at least have titles or Closed captioning to help us out. Picture quality is good and the only thing that saves this from receiving no stars. How can we enjoy a mystery if half the dialogue is unheard? Criterion has let us all down and has dumped on Hitch. They have not served him or us well. Save your money!"
2,Not so rugged,"I've had this bag for the last 7 months. Its been in constant use for about 5 months. I have to say I am disappointed in this bag. Space wise, it fits everything we need to carry with us for a day or even a weekend away. However It already has a hole in it from where a handle pulls at the seam when I lift it. Its definitely not going to last until the munchkin was out of diapers. Totally bummed."
4,dad gear courier bag,Can any diaper bag really be manly? Well this one comes pretty close without going over the top with say skulls and flames on it. Good amount of storage and fairly user friendly. Changing pad it comes with is a bit flimsy but I just toss in a waterproof pad in there to use with it. Wipes container is a good feature too. Wife sometimes grabs mine over her larger Coach diaper bag. (Which may not be that good of a thing as I shelled out some serious cash for it for her lol)
4,Kama Sutra brings tears to my eyes everytime.,Every time I listen to this CD I have to hold the tears back only to wind up smiling in the end. It calls your soul to the surface...allowing you to meet...face to face...leaving you breathless. The movie along with the CD makes me proud to be of a descendant of South Asia. I never knew how beautiful my people were until I saw this movie and listened to this soundtrack. People of all nations will truly enjoy the splendor of it all...and that's no exagerration. Words still cannot describe...you must listen for yourself.
5,"Great Indian Mystery, well-done",This is a very nice album for esoteric enthusiasts to add to their Indian mix.
3,I wanted to love this book....,"I wanted so much to love this book, but I just never could care enough about the abstract mismatch of characters and I found myself distracted by most anything...leaving the book for days then picking it up again and hoping it would get better. It was not a bad read at all, but it wasn't as memorable a novel as I'd hoped."
4,HomeRight Paint Stick,"A little time-consuming to clean, but works great. Makes painting much easier and less messy."
2,"Disappointed...Paintstick provides no true ""advantage""","I bought this paintstick to paint 2 rooms, with celings. I got one coat on each ceiling & it worked ok but I wouldn't say that it's better than traditional rollers or that it saves you time or energy. If anything, its heavier and makes you work harder and takes just as much time. Furthermore, cleaning this thing not only takes a phD but it also takes an hour plus AND was so tedious I ended up throwing it away...I just didnt see the value.The instruction booklet is 2 pages on setup and use and 6 pages on cleaning. No thanks."
4,Bill Monroe!,"While there are a couple of tracks I skip over every time I listen to the CD, it is a great Bill Monroe album."
2,headache- noise and mouse still here after 3 wks,"So far not good. Two live-traps baited with chocolate and peanut butter and kitty food have not been successful in catching our mice so I broke down and bought this product. Plugged it in the kitchen and found it emits unpleasant AUDIBLE (yes, heard by humans) high pitched noise which gave two people in our apartment a headache. So, I installed it in my room as it didn't bother me as much and a second similar product in the kitchen pantry that is just EMF-based repeller (and w/ no sound non-headache producing). Several weeks have passed but we still have mouse sightings and found mouse droppings all over the floor in one room. Product promised results in 2-3 weeks.The air-ionizing and nightlight f(n)s seem to work just fine, but I bought this to chase away rodents.Disappointed, housemate has lost patience with non-violent approach is calling for kill-traps. :("
1,But it makes for an interesting night light!,This piece of junk doesn't repel anything. I'm not a child but even I have noticed weird feedback noise emitting from the device from time to time. The only good thing I can say is it does make for an interesting night light.
4,"Mostly funny, although it thinks more of itself than it is","If you can look at this movie in two different ways, separating the two and realizing that one is far superior to the other, you will very much enjoy this film. I won't bother summarizing plot, so let me get straight into it:As a comedy, this movie is certainly up to par. Most of the courtroom scenes are quite funny, and Daniels is good in the role of the impatient, worried, and upset lawyer (now actor). One scene in particular, where Jennifer Coolidge (""Stifler's Mom"" in American Pie) poses as a doctor literally puts me in hysterics every time I watch it.Where this movie fails, however, is its attempt to be a heartwarming romance, with Jeff Daniels having to choose over the girl he should marry, and the girl he really loves.Still, this movie is quite funny overall, and if you can forgot about the romantic aspect, it's definitely worth your while."
1,Modern pest,"India is becoming more and more ""plastic"", more ""McDonalish"" through this kind of Westernized products. I deplore the usage of a Roland or Korg synth in this recording...No wonder some moron from NC likes it. A real insult to all of us who read about India and its almost endless Universe of thought."
3,"Preposterous premise, but Bennett makes it work delightfully well","Another thoughtful and humorous novella by Alan Bennett. As with ""The Uncommon Reader,"" this book has a preposterous premise, but Alan Bennett makes it work. And in fact, it's the ridiculousness of the premise that makes the book so compelling! Mr. and Mrs. Ransome come home from the opera one night to find that their flat has been completely cleaned out... down to the stove and appliances--including the casserole left to warm in the stove! This elicits very different reactions from Mr. and Mrs. Ransome, each of whom have been going through the motions for years, stuck in stagnation and complacency.I didn't enjoy this one quite as much as ""The Uncommon Reader,"" I didn't feel the same kinship with the Ransomes as I did with the Queen in ""Reader."" Still, this is a funny and though-provoking book, absolutely worth the afternoon it will take you to read it."
2,Not for the sophisticated sports gambler,"I'll get to the point: This book is a waste of time for readers who already have some introduction to baseball and gambling and are looking to get a winning edge. If you are looking for bet ideas from a winning gambler that are shown to statistically outperform the casino odds historically, look elsewhere.Instead you will find a handful of bet ideas, lost in a sea of painfully detailed play-by-play summaries of the events of the 2004 season, tied together clumsily by a universal idea of ""military maxims"". The bet ideas are justified with some general commentary followed by ""here's one time that the bet worked in the 2004 season"", which goes on for pages and is hardly convincing. The misspellings are frequent and get annoying.In summary, you don't need to pay 14 bucks for detailed summaries of the 2004 season - go to espn.com."
1,Absolute Garbage,"I'll keep this brief. I just bought 6 books on sports gambling and odds. This one is the worst. It is absolute garbage. Like one of the reviews states above this book needs to be edited. So many misspellings and grammatical errors, so annoying. Besides that his advice makes no sense. There's nothing here, look elsewhere."
2,Not What I Expected,"I've been hunting for a good quality edible glitter for months now, and from the photo and the other reviews, I though this was going to be what I wanted. It's not. These are just those sugar crystal sprinkles that you can get in the grocery store (clear or colored) for about $3 a bottle. They are slightly smaller and shinier than what I've seen, but there's not enough of a difference to be worth $11 a bottle plus shipping. Big disappointment..."
2,Fictional Christmas Stories With Little Seasonal Inspiration,"This book is similar to ""Southern Christmas: Literary Classics Of The Holidays"" which I also reviewed, in that the stories are all fictional. However, I enjoyed the variety here more than in ""Southern Christmas."" These stories provide interesting glimpses into life in the Maritimes and Newfoundland, an area of the world which largely unknown to me. The majority of the stories do not treat most of the traditional Seasonal themes. If you are looking for true and more sentimental or inspirational stories you may be disappointed with ""Gifts to Last"". There are a couple of pieces in the volume some may consider irreverent."
4,Excellent - a great starter book for sciatica sufferers,With the millions of people out there that suffer from low back pain and sciatica-information is scarce! This book breaks the surface and let's you know how to do things that will help your pain.Not clinical or very in depth BUT it is written to help you solve your pain in terms we all can understand.It makes you feel that you are not alone in your pain and at the same time you wonder why more information and help isn't available for this common malady. I liked the book for what it tries to do-HELP WITH BACK PAIN RELIEF
3,A bunch of noses,"I read the nose book, it was about all the kinds of noses.It was about what the noses were used for.Noses were used for sun-glasses.You get nose colds, and nose burns."
1,Played all wrong!,"I don't really see why there is all this great furour over Angela Hewitt's playing. All the faults of her other Bach recordings are on full display here: She has a way of focussing on a voice by making the others practically inaudible. This works well for Couperin - and I greatly enjoy her recordings of Couperin - where the melodic line is more important, and other voices less important than in Bach.However, in Bach's music, this kills the intricate weaving of voices that are its glory. While her playing is quite refined, it is all veneer, and no substance."
3,"Better than I expected, though not complete.","I noticed a few songs on the album that aren't in the movie, and some that are in the movie and not on the album (the tracks by Republica). I had to buy those two songs -- ""Drop Dead Gorgeous"" and ""Ready to Go"" -- just to have a more complete experience."
2,"Good soundtrack, but the movie's better","The main reason why I brought this soundtrack was because I only liked 2 songs on their which was ""Youth of America"" and ""School's Out"". The rest of the songs are okay but I think the movie's better than the soundtrack because the movie is scary, that is if you like SCARY movies. Now I am a big fan of scary movies but the only scary movie I don't like is Hellraiser. I think Hellraiser is retarded and it's not even scary it's just like Terminator 2. Scream is the best out of all horror films including I Know What You Did Last Summer and Halloween. I recommened that if ya'll hadn't listened to this soundtrack yet, should. It is a good soundtrack but some of the songs on there are just dumb. I would just stick with the movie."
5,A must buy soundtrack,This is one of my favorite soundtracks. I think the music fits the movie perfectly. My favorite song on it is Artificial World by Julee Cruise. All of the songs have that creepy thing necessary for a horror movie.
4,Eye of the Dolphin DVD,"Eye of the DolphinThis is a nice story, kind of predictable. I enjoyed it because I love to watch dolphins. I liked the people and scenes from the Bahamas."
4,Fast shipping,I am very pleased with this product. I would recommend this product to all my friends. The price was a lot cheaper than all the retail stores that sold this product.thanks
1,Out of date,"If you're looking to work with USB, this book is way too out of date. It includes Windows 98 sample code (on floppy disk) and does not mention USB 1.1 or 2.0. 65 of the 170 pages are sample code that are on the companion disk.I recommend looking at something like USB Complete by Jan Axelson."
4,Easton 7' pop up net,I recently purchased the net. It is a good piece of equipment to have. I have four kids and they all use it. It has been a GREAT help for them and would highly recommend the net to anyone. The only thing that kept me from giving it five stars is folding it up takes a little getting used to but once you figure it out it is not too bad.
2,Better to get the Jugs Insta Screen,"Bought this for batting at home in June '06. Works great only if set up on a slight incline (hitting slightly down hill). On flat ground, or any type of grade going up behind the net, it falls down at the slightest wind. Actually it falls down even when set up ideally with the most moderate of winds.Balls normally kick out of this net rather than staying inside. Also, one of the two folding polls had the metal nipple part push back up into the poll, which I have to pull back out every time I set it up.do what 95% of serious teams do (go to any baseball or softball Travel tournament and you'll see), and get a Jugs Insta-Net for only $10-$20 more."
4,"Pretty good, but not great","A lot of the kitchens, bedrooms and bathrooms in this book are pretty outlandish and tacky that very few people would really want. But not all of them. My favorite part of the book is the chapter on family rooms, recreation rooms and dens. That chapter is better. This is worth having if you are interested in 1950's interiors, but just be prepared for a lot of tacky rooms. There are enough rooms that are not tacky to make the book worth while, at least for me."
1,Dissapointment,Initallly I thought this was going to be a book of mid-century furniture. Boy was I ever wrong. If you want to see 50's bad taste here is your chance.
4,"Great book, if you aren't two years old","I like this book. My husband likes this book. My 19 year old likes this book. But my 2 year old flips the pages so fast she must be related to the poor caterpillar. She does keep asking for it, which is a hopeful sign to me--maybe one day she will actually hear the ""slow down and relax"" message like the caterpillar does."
2,Aweful,"The flag that I received looked nothing like the picture and nothing like the Louisiana state flag. Louisiana's flag is not bright blue, it does not contain a swan, the banner is yellow and contains more colors than bright blue, white, and black."
4,Soul Groove,Musiq has a melow smooth quality that has been missing in music the past few years.. Artist like Troop in the early 90's had a similar flavor..
2,Deleted words in the book,"Some of the words in the book were Deleted, it was very frustrating, the book is real old and it smells. it would be nicer to advertis it as ""poor condtions"" instead of "" Good conditions"" so overall i am not happy."
3,Use the Kaufmann translation instead,"This is a great book, written originally in German. The German language has two second person singular pronouns: ""dich"", and ""du"". ""Du"" is reserved for intimate friends. RG Smith, in the 30's, translated Buber's book ""Ich und Du"", rendering ""du"" as ""Thou"". In 1969, after Buber died, his son asked Walter Kaufmann, himself a well-known philosopher and translater, to retranslate the text. Kaufmann renders ""du"" as ""You"". I think this makes all the difference in the world, whether you think of ""Thou"" as aloof and transcendent, or as ""You"", intimate and immanent. I recommend the Kaufmann translation over the Smith."
2,bad binding,"this is a wonderful book, and the Smith translation is fine, but this binding isn't worth the high price for this edition. While it's nice that the book is in hardcover, there's no way that it justifies the price, as the book is glued, rather than sewn, meaning that repeated readings and use will eventually result in lost pages, etc. I returned my copy. What's worse, the book appears to be photocopied, with left-hand text blocks often skewed to the printed page, and a postage stamp randomly photocopied on top of some text on p. 75. Somebody is trying to make money (off you) from this book's being past copyright."
1,I and Thou,"item was received in a timely fashion. excellent condition. problem with printing. page 23 was missing. returned item only to find that the replacement had the same issue. there is a disconnect in reading. tried to go along without the missing page but had difficulty in making the connection. it may be a printer's error, but it is rathering annoying"
4,Good Buy,"I put this product together myself, which means it was relatively simple. Was in good shape and seems durable. Shipped here several days before they said it would be here."
1,Very bad quality,It is quite unfortunate but the quality of this product is less than ikea. The hardware was defective and the board quality is paper thin. I am going to try to get a refund because I am so dissatisfied with this product. Two thumbs down!
3,slow shipping,Took five weeks to get my mirror.Tracking was useless. Multiple emails and voice mails went unanswered. Was just about to do a charge back and it arrived. Great price if you can wait.
5,Title of CD explains it all,"This is nice mix of Neo Soul and Hip Hop. With guest like Shawn Stockman of Boyz II Men, Jill Scott, and other Philly Natives. The CD is so smooth and is just good music. Jazzy Jeff shows that he can stand on his own, but we still want that reunion with Big Willy."
5,great cookbook,"This cookbook has been in my maternal family for four generations and I am now buying it for my grandchildren - fifth generation. Have also over the years given it as a gift to many newlyweds who all have voiced appreciation. One of my daughters has my Grand-mother's copy (badly worn but still readable) and the other has my mother's copy (in much better condition, but also well worn). Still the best cookbook around, especially when used along with internet recipes. The only other cookbook I consider really useful is the old Gourmet's Basic French Cookbook by Louis Diat."
5,The Best of the Lefties (Mr. Grove),"I was particularly happy to receive this book on Lefty Grove because, as with a number of pre-World War II stars, a meaningful biography has been lacking about them. Jim Kaplan's version of Grove's life isn't perfect, but it's close enough, filled with stories about Grove, his teammates and the times. It's an interesting, well-written, thoughtful biography about an outstanding pitcher and one of the best ballplayers ever, and fills a gap in baseball literature that needed to be addressed."
4,Makes pulse diagnosis easy for anybody,I Realy enjoyed this book. It makes pulse diagnosis acceessible to anybody even without a lot of experience. Very clear and sharp distinctions are made between the different pulses. The writer shares his experience which realy helps.
1,Horrible,"First of all, I would like to say that the text and cds for The Study of Orchestration are excellent (with a few exceptions). However, this workbook is horrible. The exercises make no sense and the instructions for doing them are unclear and confusing at best. Often these exercises include things that were not present in the book or concepts are presented in a manner different from the text. There are a huge number of mistakes in the workbook, especially in regard to track numbers on the cds (sold separately). Avoid this at all costs. It has nothing to offer. Any competent teacher should be able to come up with their own exercises that would have much more practical value. Unfortunately, I am in an arranging and scoring class where the teacher seems to think this book is the best thing since sliced bread. What a moron."
2,Thought I was getting the textbook.,I went online to buy the textbook that this workbook goes to and bought the workbook by mistake. I guess I was so excited by what I thought was a low price for the textbook that I leapt before looking. Now I can't afford the textbook for a while and the workbook is kind of useless without it. Caveat emptor.
3,I like 112...,"But this cd left me disappointed. It's ok, but no where near their last cd. If you're not a big 112 fan, go ahead and spend your money on a different cd."
2,What happened?!!,"As much as I love 112, I was very disappointed with this CD. There were only 2 songs I really, really loved: ""Right Here For U"" and ""Knock U Down"". The rest are pretty weak and I didn't even enjoy the interludes, which have been TIGHT in the past! I was glad 112 admitted that they DID, in fact, get lazy and thought too highly of themselves while working on this album, because it showed greatly. I'm hoping it won't happen again."
4,Decent album but not da best 112 album,"This album is okay i mean it's start's off with a bunch of uptempo songs and then it starts to get good at #7. In that track, which is called ""right here for you"", clearly they bited out of jodeci because when you listen to it carefully guess what it sounds like? It sounds like one of my favorite classics from JODECI ""feenin'"". Even though saying that, i still like track #7 because it's the only highlight slow song in da album. The other tracks i like is the remix to hot & wet, which was pretty good i mean it features luda and chingy. Also, other songs to consider all my love, and you said. In comparison with the jagged edge ""hard"" album, the new 112 is better. Finally, if i had to rank all 4 of the 112 albums, this one would come in third out of the 4. Here's how i would rank them #1 112/ #2 ROOM 112/ #3 HOT & WET/ #4 PART III.P.S. What happened to the old school 112? You know da one's that actually sang good love songs instead of uptempo songs?"
4,Everybody gets the blues,"This is a wonderful book on the subject of moods. The protagonist has the low-down laudry line blues and as she looks at an empty clothes line across the street she recognizes her own feelings as being similarly empty. Meanwhile her pesky, persistent, little sister is feeling fulled up with energy. Little sister lets her energy overflow as she shows her big sister that the empty clothes line can be used to lift the spirits. The story verse has almost a blues music sound to it that children will love repeating. As a librarian of juvenile literature I recommend the use of this book when discussing moods with pre-school and primary children"
1,Don't buy this book,"Unfortunately the other reviews are correct. The book is full of errors. The Database section shows ""actual screen shots"" from the VB IDE that simply don't exist in the product. The author obviously jumped on the bandwagon too soon by writing a book based on a beta version of VB. DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK !"
1,Don't buy this book,This is the worst book I have ever read. I could not see the logic of the writing. It also contains too many editorial errors. Don'y buy it.
1,Really disappointed,I was disappointed when I recieved this order only to find pages 39-86 missing from the hymnal. This was not made known in the sellers discription. I will put this experience as one to learn from- VERY DISAPPOINTED.
5,Better than the rest,"I started reading ASK after I had already suscribed to MUSE for less than a year. The information in ASK is just as challeging and exciting as magazines for older kids! I love the pictures, format, activities; even the font of it. Anyone who breathes, lives, and exists normally--read ASK!"
2,"Obfuscated text, with an orotund tone","I was extremely disappointed with this book. The auther attempts to appear clever and sly, but ends up sounding verbose and grandiloquent. Blast!"
1,Used==Get Burned!!,"Big complaint about the lack of warning about WoW used software on the site.WoW already has Burning Crusade. You just need to activate it. They will not let you reuse an activation code that has previously been used on a different account. A Used WoW game is therefore worthless.Amazon will refund your money (most likely), but one has to question the idiocy of selling a WoW Used product. Most likely it is only because Amazon has no way to make this kind of exception for Used items on the site, and/or they do no foward looking investigation when selling Used items. And because many sellers/buyers are unaware of Blizzard's activation policies until they contact them to get the required information. Amazon should enhance the database to make exceptions for this type of Used software item. Activation codes are becoming extremely common, and I'm betting this issue has been encountered many times already."
1,Class Balance Lost in this Expansion,"This expansion ruined WoW.Got my character to 70 bought the flying mount, then canceled my subscription.Why? you may ask, class balance has been ruined.I spent more time being corpse camped by random mages, then I spent playing.To be sure, I understand that corpse camping is a part of the game, what I don't understand is how a level 70 character can be basically 1 hit by another 65 plus character.Solution? simple, put a limit on the amount of dots a mage can stack on another character in pvp, have different limits applied to pve.Anyway, If you enjoy WoW you may be disappointed by the BC expansion.Side Note, IF you are a WoW junky that spends every waking hour in game, and have all the best gear, then BC may be just what the doctor ordered, for the casual gamer though, its a game stopper."
1,Beware of this game,"I have played this game for around two years and have multiple level 70 characters and thoroughly enjoy it. However the game is broken (as of october 2008) and unplayable at the moment due to horrendous lag issues and server shut downs. Check out the forums for more information, well no information really, but you'll see the scale of the problem:My advice is avoid this game and the new expansion pack Wrath of the Lich King like the plague until the game becomes playable again. Just thought I'd save you some dollars and whole bunch of frustration."
2,Poor packaging,This CD arrived promptly. Before I opened it and found out that the jewel cover was smashed I noticed that the packaging seemed flimsy. It was in a white paper envelope folded over. There was no cardboard covering just the envelope. I would think that someone who ships CD's would know that this packing is not adequate for the kinds of machines that the postal service uses. The CD is fine but I have no storage for it since the jewel case is shattered. I would not buy from this purveyor again.
3,Seems to work?,"OK, I'm not sure how to write a review about a ""candle"". First off, it is more of the lamp. I bought this, and it has been on the shelf since it arrived. If you want to buy a candle / lamp for a power outage, this is a good choice. If you don't want to buy one, then why are you reading the reviews?"
3,Non-Refillable,"These are NOT refillable. The top does not come off, well it might, but it is defiantly not designed to come off. I bought two at a time and one of them did not leak, but the other leaked everywhere similar to the experience of other reviewers. They did put the lamps in a zip lock baggie, which helped minimize the contamination, but still got other stuff in my shipment greasy. These are liquid paraffin candles. Liquid paraffin does not burn like gas, it is pretty hard to light unless it is on a wick, which seems fairly safe. Paraffin does not evaporate as easily, and it is the vapors that burn. Is is odorless and burns odorless. These are plastic. The wick was barely exposed and made a very small flame, so i pulled it out a bit and now i works well. Hopefully it does not melt the plastic container.- 1 star for poor shipment packaging-1 star for not being refillable"
5,not in the dark,I had been looking for a safe way to have candlelight without out the mess of waxthis one's perfectI'm so happy I put it in my stained glass candle holderno mess to clean up I highly recommend it
3,Pleasant but disappointing read,"This book is part of a series entitled ""Personal Takes,"" so Showalter needlessly pretends to provide a historical survey of the academic novel and fails in this ambition. Probably everyone will have favorites that this approach omits; I, for example, was sorry that Showalter had nothing to say about Jane Smiley's wonderful Moo. Some of the books she does discuss are given little coverage beyond plot summary.Still, I enjoyed what Showalter did have to say, particular her thoughts on Middlemarch and The Corrections. Indeed, if this book had been more straightforwardly a personal take it would have been even more engaging."
4,The Movie was on point! I give this one a play!,"The movie was awsome! For real doe! I used to watch tales from the darkside from back in the days! I enjoy every episode! I was a child when they have aired the show! The movie was all good! I'm not saying it's the best, but it's all good! Thanks amazon for this dvd!De'Vear SmallDecatur GA"
3,But Deborah Harry is good,"A so so colection of stories. But what do you expect from Tales from the Darkside. ""Lot 249"" is a staid run of the mill mummy story with a corny ending. ""Cat From Hell"" stiff and with awful props. ""Lovers Vow"" this one is pretty decent. Interesting story line, pretty faces, and a a plot which isn't 100% predictable. In the wraparound story Debbie Harry is as buetiful as ever and for a Debbie Harry fan like me her brief appearances make this worthwhile."
3,Brace Yourself,"As a person who needs to wear a knee brace on an everyday- all day basis, I found one important fault with this brace. The back of the brace has some sort of mesh material that is abrasive on the back of the leg right at the bending position and makes it uncomfortable to wear. When you first put the brace on, it feels good. After wearing it for about an hour, you feel the mesh cutting in to the back of the knee and it hurts. I then have to place a tissue inside the brace to block the mesh from the back of the leg and that is not an easy thing to do. Also the top of the brace tends to fold over.I actually like the way the rest of the brace is structured and hope that eventually the mesh softens enough for everyday wear. I think that the description should state that the mesh exists and maybe even why they chose to add it to the product."
2,Recaps at best...,"If you have seen every season of all the real housewives, then this would be just as boring and a waste of an hour as it was for me. I kept waiting to see something new or shocking, I kind of saw the number #1 top housewives coming and it has to do with jersey. So if you just want a recap of the highlights of all the real housewives, then watch it, otherwise, its a waste of time."
4,Works well,This smoother works better than I'd hoped. My only complaint is that the handle isn't the most comfortable to hold when you really have to rub hard on a callous.
2,Disappointing,"From the reviews, I expected so much more from this book. It does have a very attractive layout, but the content doesn't live up to the presentation. There doesn't appear to be much new here. If you are just going to buy one book about this artform, I would recommend Hellmuth's ""Collage Discovery Workshop"". It came out over three years ago, but still sets the standard with innovative ideas and provides a lot of inspiration."
3,Lovely artwork...stories not so much,"The illustrations are really nice, but the stories are rather dumb, for lack of a better word. My husband and I read them to our 18 month old son, and he's as unimpressed as we are. He does enjoy the pictures; however, the Kim and Carrots illustrations are a little scary. We will try another magazine when this subscription ends."
5,An ongoing favorite at our house,"I bought a year of these at a consignment sale 4 years ago when my son was a baby. Now he is 4 1/2 and has a 2 yr old sister. No book in our extensive collection is more asked for by toddlers. Over and over and over. They love the simple, catchy rhymes and the interesting illustrations that provide so much to talk about. They love the predictability of the strangely gender- and ethnically-neutral Kim and Carrots. As a parent and a public school teacher, I love all these things too and how they provide opportunities to develop language and reading comprehension and phonemic awareness skills. The simple stories and rhymes truly capture the world of the toddler from their own perspective. I can't wait to order Ladybug now that my kids are getting older. I highly recommend this magazine for your toddler."
2,Some content questionable,"I was fully prepared to purchase two gift subscriptions of Babybug; however, after reading a sample issue changed my mind. Once concern was the selection of the nursery rhyme Old King Cole who ""smoked a pipe"" and the second was the contrasting of big and little using a pig and a wig. I would prefer not to show smoking in a book geared to such a young age group and find it unusual that a wig was chosen. These two choices by the editors in the same issue regretably caused me to reconsider and decide against the purchase of this subscription.I"
3,A Winter's HIbernation,"Hey, its better than Johnny Rivers attempts at being cool, and some of the production of Curt Boetchner is evident, which is a good thing. This album reminds me a little of another ""closet classic"" from Billy Nichols (Would You Believe)...I would get the later before this CD. Definately a dissappointment to Tommy Roe fans who expect ""retro 50's"" stuff. Also, why not cut to the chase and pick up Saggitarious (produced by Gary Usher and starring Curt Boetchner)...this is the cream of this puffy psychedelic pop."
2,Stinks and Proves Ineffective,"The purpose of Vata Massage oil is to address the particular vitiation of the vata (air) dosha in the body, which is the etiological cause of around 60-80% of all diseases listed in Ayurvedic literature, including nervous disorders. The oil stinks. At least in my case, it did. Moreover, the fact that it was herbalized proved to have no significant benefits over regular sesame oil, whether I used it for abhyanga or in a basti. Finally, given that this oil is much more expensive than regular sesame oil (from Banyan Botanicals), it is highly recommendable for one to purchase and utilize regular organic sesame oil instead. Those are my two cents."
5,Get Shorty,"Barry Sonnenfeld helmed this, the best adaptation of any Elmore Leonard work to-date. The film is fast and funny, as it lampoons goombahs and La-La land with equal abandon. Players are all in top form, with Dennis Farina a stand-out as a disgruntled mobster who gets on Chili's bad side. Look for a pre-Sopranos James Gandolfini as a hapless bodyguard."
3,Leonard's Tale,"Funky Elmore Leonard tale that gets in digs against Hollywood. Hackman has a knack for playing smarmy characters, and Dennis Farina (a former Chicago cop) plays a good heavy."
5,One of my favorite movies,"This is one of the few movies I own that I can watch again and again. It is definitely one of my all-time favorites.Get Shorty is smart and funny. A load of great actors and great acting, full of smart humor and a great story. Definitely for a more mature audience and not for people that think such titles as Final Destination are worthy of an Oscar ..."
3,Could Use Bogart's Sam Spade,"Elmore Leonard books have been around for a while. I haven't indulged because essentially they are genre books, detective, gangster yarns. However, they adapt nicely to film: Jackie Brown, and now Get Shorty.John Travolta, Gene Hackman, Danny Devito and other Hollywood or gangster types give a modern characterization of sleazy schemers, fast sex, and money. The gangsters are portrayed not unlike Hollywood producers or actors. They are all ruthless and money grubbing. Power and egotism is all that matters. Life is cheap. Yet this is a comedy, a satire. Travolta is playing a parody of his Pulp Fiction character. Danny Devito isn't very convincing as an actor though he is an actor. Get the joke? Here's the problem: it's funny at times, but in the end, nobody cares how cool Travolta is. Nobody is sympathetic. We don't identify with thugs and slime. Call Sam Spade if you want something more."
1,JUNK,"I like John Travolta but this was the dumbest movie ever put on film. Hard to follow, no plot. It was horrible, worst movie I've seen. Don't waste your time or your money."
3,Pretty Good,"this film is pretty good.the thing that works well for the film is that the actors here work well with each other.even though John Travolta is the main Star here Danny Devito,Gene Hackman&Rene Russo are Equaly Parts.this type of film has been done countless times so that's one of the reasons why I don't go higher in Numbers also it has alot Over the top Drama.but the Cast is the selling point of the film and they make it work."
1,GET LOST!,"I got this movie free when I purchased my DVD player, and now I know why. I cant even give it away. I personally dont know a single person who liked this movie. Dont waste your time or money on this."
3,GREAT everyday lead!!!,"I use this lead around the barn on A daily basis and I LOVE IT!!! Not the most stylish rope ever but great for around the barn on A daily basis. Cheap, durable, and my favorite!!!"
4,And on drums.....,"I endorse everything said about this gem by other reviewers, having owned a British (different sleeve) vinyl copy for many years. Can I just draw your attention to the drumming? Terrific! My memory tells me most of it is by Dr Rick Jaeger and as a drummer myself it had a big influence on me. Effortlessly funky."
3,Red Locker,My son wanted this for his 6th birthday. We were pleasantly surprised at the quality and durability of the item. It is made pretty well. He uses it in his bedroom for storeage. He loves it. He loves the red color also.
4,They work!,"I bought this lot of BBs as a stocking stuffer for my nephews to accompany their new automatic airsoft guns. It's a good thing these are cheap because they can now shoot off 30 rounds about every two seconds. You can tell the BBs are made cheaply, but they load and shoot just fine. Great for target practice or a backyard battle."
5,distinct difference,"A brighter, better looking amber driving lamp than the 'white' stock driving lamps. They seem to be a little pricey but are slightly brighter than the led amber driving lamps that I tried. Well worth the difference!"
2,Does not *MENTION* LINQ,"This is several books in one, (six authors). Doesn't even MENTION LINQ, also misses KEY C# features like iterators, object initializers, query expressions, anonymous types, etc."
3,Too much handholding,"This book is a decent introduction to the C# language, in a very slow, very hold-your-hand sort of way. The later chapters on using C# in .NET applications aren't terribly useful because they follow the same overly simplified style of explanation and ultimately run out of space for advanced features.I usually don't criticize writing styles, but certain grammatical constructs are overused in this book and began to grate on me. If I had this in electronic form, I'd love to see how many times the phrase, ""The idea is that,"" appears in this book. I even saw, ""The thing is that,"" which should never appear in writing. If your sentence begins with ""The [generic noun] is that,"" you can generally omit this entire phrase."
1,Not working anymore,"After I used this item couple of months, it stopped working properly.Maybe it is because of rain, I don't know.But right now, it gives the alarm sound even if it is detached and unlocked.No matter what I did, it is always acting like it is attached and locked.So I take out the battery and use it just as a ""lock"" without the alarm feature.If the garage is outdoors, this is not the item for you.By the way, I bought it for my bike(Honda CBR600RR'05)."
4,Overall best Hockey game Ive played,"I had recently purchased a 989 hockey game and was dissapointed while it was good it was not quite what I was looking for. I ordered this one and upon its arrival began playing. I found it excellent, it has all the usuall options for creation and teams, but you can also play as all the AHL minor leauge teams, which I almost enjoy more than playing as the NHL teams. For the controling you have the new hybrid controls that involve using the right stick for deaking and shooting. If you dont like this though they have an option for classic controls which I was suprised by and very glad about, and if you want to just change a few things in the controls there is a custom option. The graphics could be a little better they look alot like older versions but there isnt the same boxy quality to the game play.Overall a great game."

2,Flatfoots,"The Protectors is a continuation of Mahoney's series of police procedurals. This story of kidnapping and international intrigue has all the makings of an exciting and involving tale. Unfortunately, Mahoney has managed to turn this one into a dull affair. McKenna and Sanchez, the recurring heroes, are in their usual position of command over events, but the plot twists and casual conversation are about as exciting as bird watching. Mahoney has done better."
2,"eh, big deal",I'm half Thai so my girlfried reccommended this book which she saw in a brick and mortar bookstore. I wasn't overly impressed though.
2,Shortsighted perspective on solving a major dilemma,"It's bewildering to realize just how recently this treatise was written, given the archaic language and obsolete rhetoric. Woodson does a thorough job of renouncing the organs of oppression and discussing just how pervasive the oppression seeps. However, he slips into the foresighted logic of accusing African Americans of their own limitations. However, historians will likely appreciate reviewing the perspective as an indicator of the range and development of civil rights rhetoric."
4,Re-education of the mental,An enlightening perspective on the need for self-determination through self-education; to purge from within all that you learned which was false.
2,Limited success,"I was under the impression, somehow, that this wash stick attached to a hose. It doesn't. You fill up the small reservoir in the handle instead. It works OK with a bucket. The mop end is sort of a skeep-skin affair. I think it would hold up reasonably well if you used it on a car, but it will fray to pieces pretty quick if you try to use it on painted wood, as I did."
5,Invaluable,"I was reassigned from my middle school classroom to the high school and when I arrived I found a classroom set of textbooks, but no workbook. No teacher's book, no used workbooks, nothing! So I hit up Amazon and purchased a copy for myself and it has been one of the best purchases I've made."
2,My baby gnawed this to bits in 10 min!,"These pieces are fine unless your baby bites his/her toys--umm, every baby I know!--which may be why they are recommended for 2 year olds, but I am having trouble imagining what 2 year old would play with this boring puzzle. My daughter (10 months) likes it a lot, but she bit the head off the turtle in 10 minutes and now wants to gnaw the rest of the coloring off the other pieces. Sure, it's entertaining, but I don't want the printed paper in her tummy!"
1,Made in China!,"I bought this puzzle assuming it was made in the USA because it clearly states ""Origin: USA"" in the product description. I do not understand why a seller would supply false information. By purchasing this product I (and everyone else who purchased it) unknowingly supported the oppressive communist regime of the People's Republic of China. Major fail."
3,disappointing,"Our eight-month-old received this for Christmas, and we were really excited about it. He's still too little to put together a puzzle, but the colors and shapes fascinate him. Unfortunately, he puts everything in his mouth. After he'd been sucking on one of the pieces for about 3 minutes we noticed something on his lip. The pictures are basically paper on top of wood, which came off into his mouth. I realize he's younger than the suggested age, but I don't think he'll stop putting things in his mouth in the next four months. We're planning to put this puzzle away for a few months and then try it again."
1,Horrible!,"I'm on my way back to return these! I thought I'd like it since there were 20 curlers and not my regular 12. After trying repeatedly, THE CURLERS WON'T STAY IN MY HAIR....they just dangle. There is nothing holding hair into place. I'd give 0 stars if there was a place for it!."
3,This is a decent product...,"My friend used these and she has very very thick hair. She found that these curlers tended to ""crimp"" her hair, which she said might have been due to her hair being so thick, but I also think had to do with hair placement. I was going to test them on myself until, while on my honeymoon, this product along with 1/2 of my belongs got thrown/given away... However, I trust my friends opinion, and she has a lot of experience with hair products and curling irons and things like this.God Bless ~Amy"
3,"Good idea, but didn't really work","I had high hopes for this set of rollers, but they didn't impress me. I will qualify this by saying that I have exceptionally long hair that is difficult to curl. Even with the length and texture of my hair, however, I can usually get a decent curl that last as least a couple of hours. With these rollers my curl looked beautiful when I first took them out, and then it completely fell out within minutes. I was really disappointed. Maybe someone with shorter, less difficult hair would have better luck, but for someone with difficult to curl hair, this product is not the best solution. (It seems sleeping on sponge rollers is still the best solution for us.)"
4,Curly girl,"I bought these rollers this morning and am very pleased with the result. They heat up quickly, didn't burn my fingers or my head, and put big bouncy curls in my poker-straight hair. Previous reviewers have complained of creases at the scalp, and I did have 2 or 3 but that can be easily remedied by adjusting the position of the clip. It only took a few minutes to smooth that out with a curling iron - easy peasy.I would definitely buy these again; the only reason I'm giving 4 instead of 5 stars is b/c they cost more than I originally wanted to spend."
3,Great curl if the clips didn't create ridges,"This product is very easy to use and creates a great, long-lasting curl. The heated clamps, however, create annoying ridges in my hair. I am not sure if I will keep the product for this reason. I am thinking of trying revlon superclips or the pins to see if the result is any better. Kinda disappointing since I love the result...but hate the darn ridges!"
1,Failure,"Pros: operate with lid closed, on/off switchCons: Takes up way too much space, hard to use without burning your fingers because the heating contact point is across the length of the roller & I burnt my fingers trying to get my hair onto the roller.But the main reason I'm taking these back is because the crease/dent it left in my hair. HORRIBLE."
2,"Creases, creases, creases","Good head, like the soft surface but the clips leave ridges in your hair that you have to straighten out with a curling iron."
1,Puts ugly crimps in your hair!!!,I am very disappointed with these. Just like someone else has already said the heated clips put very noticeable ridges in your hair at the top of the curl. I would not recommend these and I am going to return them tomorrow.
3,Pretty good,"This book is a pretty good review of Tai Chi. I also purchased Yang Jwing-Ming's book ""Tai Chi Chuan, Classical Yang Style"" and I have enjoyed reading it much more. It gives a lot of background and insight behind Yang style Tai Chi and the different levels of achievment."
4,More complex than I expected,"This movie progressed far differently than I expected. Based on the reviews, I thought it would be a silly murder flick along the same line as ""Clue."" Then when I started watching it, I thought it was just going to insult conservatives for the next hour and a half. Mistaken, on both counts. It ended up being an increasingly serious commentary on the dangers of polarized world views and how even the best of intentions may do more harm than good. Still, there are some laughs, but I wouldn't really call this movie a comedy."
2,Not loud enough,"We purchased this CD player for one of our twins who is very sick in the NICU. He is very sensitive to noise and with all the talking and alarms, we thought music would give him a soothing distraction. We placed this CD player right in his isolette about 4"" from his head with the volume all the way up and still couldn't hear it! For that price, I returned it. It's a shame because I really think music would be nice for him but cannot find an alternative battery operated CD player."
2,Buyer beware,"This item is not top quality. I don't have too many of this company's other products, so if this is an example of their quality than I don't think I will. First off the cover does not open without popping off the hinge and needing to be reattached, the batteries only lasted through two cd's, the volume doesn't get very high, and it doesn't even fit on the side of our crib. Being in the baby business they should know that not all crib's are made the same. You are much better off just getting a simple boom box that play's cd's."
2,NOT WORTH THE $$,I was very surprised when I used this item for the first time esp. considering the cost. The CD player volume is extremely low even on the highest setting and to make it worse the company has put the speaker exactly were the bar on the crib goes when it is attached to the crib making the music even harder to hear. I realize that a baby's music shouldn't be too loud but I like to walk around the room at night when my baby is fussy and listen to the music and it is impossible to hear. It is only good if the baby is already asleep right near the player in the crib. For th $ it is much better buying a regular CD player for the room instead and then you can use it for later uses as well.
1,No sound of Music,"I got this product as a gift and was thrilled to be able to play soothing nature sounds and lullabies for my son. Two days later the unit was out of batteries. If they wanted to make this product better, they should install an AC adaptor. As is, don't waste your money. You can get a small CD player for the same amount of money. I plan on returning this item."
2,Great Concept--frustrating reality,"When I became pregnant with my second child I was so excited to see a crib cd player! I wouldn't have to find a place to put it on a shelf or find one that 'matched' (impossible!). BUT....this thing goes through BATTERIES soooooo fast! It is definitely not worth the price unless it has a plug attachment as well as the battery option for travel. It is so frustrating! Oh, and this was my second one...the first broke within a day."
1,Waste of money,"I received this as a gift, but should have returned it. It was difficult to open and get the batteries in. The worst was that it only played a few times before the batteries wore out. Save your money and get a CD player that plugs in."
1,Disappointment,"I wish I had read the reviews before purchasing the product. I was actually looking for another CD type player online when I saw the reviews -- which are right on target. I purchased one unit, only for it to work once. I returned it and got another unit -- only for it to work for about 2 days. Save your money!!"
1,skips constantly,i have now exchanged this item three times. it skips constantly. i would not recommend it to anyone.
1,Good Only Until Baby Sits Up,"We had this unit given to us as a shower gift. Wasn't thrilled because it required changing batteries every week and was very sensitive to skipping, but it did its purpose to soothe the baby to sleep with lullaby music. Our baby is now 13 mos. and we hadn't realized that he has been picking at the clips that secure it to the railing. Just yesterday we found he had finally managed to break off a piece and almost choked on it! We do not recommend this to be placed in a crib after your child has learned to sit up.. We have written to the company to have this put on the product info. Anyone who has this should remove it once the baby sits up! We wouldn't want any other parent to have to scoop a chunk of plastic out of your toddlers mouth."
1,worst baby product I've ever bought!,This is perhaps the worst baby item I have ever bought. The volume on this player is so low we couldn't even here it on the highest setting once it was attached to the crib. Completely useless item!
1,The bad reviews were true for me too!!!,"I had to add my two cents about this product - I am so disappointed in it. I received it as a gift at a baby shower, and I thought it was really neat. However, the first one I had did not work at all, and had to be returned to the company. They sent me a replacement. It worked fine, but the batteries would only last for MAYBE a week. I used it perhaps two times with my first baby.In addition to the fact that the batteries need to be replaced constantly, the design of the product is a pain too. It is just plain difficult to change the CDs, and the buttons on the controls are tiny. Anyone who has a baby knows that any product you use for the first few months needs to be operable with just one hand.If you want to play CDs in the nursery, go to a discount store and buy a $15 CD player that will sit on the dresser. This one is a total waste of money."
1,Not worth the money,"Worst baby product I purchased, I should have just purchased a portable cd player. This product constantly eats batteries, it skips and the volume low. I would not recommend purchasing this product."
1,This stinks,"DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT, YOU WILL BE UTTERLY DISAPOINTED!!! I wanted this CD player for a very long time so I bought it a few days ago and it totally stinks. The CDs skip when the crib is bumped or just when the baby kicks. The plastic cover that protects the button does not lock or unlock into place easily and the sound is muffled because the bumber pad covers the speaker. The design was not thought out at all."
2,worked only two days,"Gave this as a gift for my grandchild...she loves the music, but only after two days, music wouldn't play, called the company and now I have to return it. Will have to buy another kind of cd player to soothe my granddaughter."
1,eye candy,being a first time mother i thought this was so cute and good to have so i put it on my registry.well i did get this item but it was not what i expected. it worked once and since i threw out the box i can't return it. it completely stopped playing the cd it makes sound as if the cd is scratched but its brand new since it only worked once...this producted is just eye candy thats it!!!now i know better
2,Product is not made well.,"I returned this product before my baby was even born. It would only fit on the back of our convertable crib which made it hard to use. In also, it broke in two places while I was trying to put the batteries in and learn how to use it. Finally, the music quility was not good. It's a great idea but I'm holding out for a better product."
1,Doesn't fit on most cribs,This would have been perfect providing it fit on most cris. I thought it was the most wonderful invention until trying to put it on the crib. I also took it to the store & tried it on 10 cribs to find it only fit 2!
1,Poor Battery Life and Shoddy Quality,"Player is relatively compact and connects easily to crib. The positives end there. Main negatives are amazingly short battery life (which I assume is a function of poor product design since the thing holds two big C-sized batteries vs. my compact little sony cd player which holds two AA batteries and plays for hours and hours) and the fact that you need a phillips head screwdriver to replace them. Also, the speaker quality is pretty weak and the controls are not very responsive. Finally, light is a nice feature but too dim to be of any real value."
3,Great idea...needs improvement on battery drainage,"I've enjoyed this product because it is small and takes up little space in the nursery, unlike a larger cd player would with a dangling cord. However, I replace my batteries what seems like every 10 c.d.s at most. It's annoying when you are having play time with your child and the music stops again because the batteries are dead. My other complaint would be the lack of ease of pulling the cover off. It is a struggle. It is only worth the [money] spent if the batteries would last longer."
1,Wish I would have read the other reviews before purchasing,"Now that I have, I agree with most. This is a very cheaply made product that is difficult to open and I can easily see how a few uses will loosen the poorly constructed hinges etc....The sound is awful as well. I'm thinking for a little more money, I will purchase a small boom box with much better sound quality, ease of use and can get more use out of it. The light isn't that impressive either.This is a good example of very poor workmanship. I was dissappointed from the minute I opened it and I tried to give it a chance but just found it difficult to use. From changing the battery to opening the front cover to opening the side to put in a CD -- Everything is hard to open and sticks real tight.When I decided to return it, I read the other reviews and wish I had read them prior to buying."
5,A great comfort,"This CD has helped me recover from a very difficult time. A lot cheaper than therapy, for me personally, more effective. It may not be perfect for eveyone (what is), but give it a chance."
5,GREAT ADVICE ! IT IS THE PROBLEM SOLVER -IF YOU HAVE KIDS,"Dr.Cathryn explains all the problems in a common sense manner. I will be a better parent to my kids.Thanks Dr. Cathryn for showing me ""how"".Great book !!"
3,Melancholy tunes with a Blues-Pop Sound,"I loved the movie ""Walking and Talking,"" and the soundtrack definitely captures the mood of the movie with its slightly-melancholy tunes. Some of the songs are not too memorable, but the four Billy Bragg (a UK pop singer) tracks make the album worth buying. Bragg's score tracks also make this album a good listen. One of the songs in the film, a rock song which was played while Catherine Keener is following Kevin Corrigan on the street, is not included; I guess it was not because it did not fit the mood of the rest of the songs. Otherwise, if you are looking for a blues-pop sort of album, this CD might just fit your tastes. I recommend that you see the movie first, however, and if you end up liking the movie, you will probably like the soundtrack as well."
5,Question,"I love the film . . . does anybody know the title of the song being played when Catherine Keener's character is holding Anne Heche's character afloat in the lake? It's a beautiful, jazzy rock song and I am trying desperately to find it! Thanks!"
2,Customer Service is not good,"Ordered this for my niece as a gift. They mistakenly sent the first issue to me (billing address) instead of my niece. I emailed to correct the problem. They said they would update the address, but said the October issue would also go to my address. The address correction would be for issues after that one. It's August! I'm cancelling the subscription and getting her a subscription to Animal Baby instead. My niece's older sister loved that one and I never had any issues with them."
5,The best mystery,I gave this book five stars because it was a mystery book that the kids are looking for a absent author. They thik she is a boy. I like it that way because you really do not know what is happening so you are wondering were the absent author is. Then once you now some clues you could find the author.
5,Nice lens,"Only had the lens a short time but so far, picture quality is awesome!!!So far LOVING it!!!!!My only complaint and one which I wrote to Amazon about is their lack of proper packaging. This is my second lens purchase with Amazon, both costing close to $1,000 each and both items came in a box twice the size of the item with 1 small balloon packing that did absolutely nothing to protect the item. Based on this I will consider buying items such as this else where unless Amazon responds to my letter stating they will change this practice!"
5,Great quality and speed,"Let me start by saying this lens focuses quickly and accurately and the image stabilization works extremely well. Pictures are sharp and contrast is beautiful.To answer the criticisms of this lens that I have seen,1. Do you actually own it?2. It's not an ""L"" series lens and has never been advertised as such. Thus, it is not weather sealed. Then again, none of the EF-S cameras are weather sealed either.3. This is the fastest, sharpest, and most hand holdable of the f2.8 lenses in canon's lineup right now. If you look at the results on Photozone.com, the 17-55 IS F2.8 is sharper than canon's famous EF 24-70 F2.8L.4. EF-S should be around long enough for you to take some great pictures with this lens. If you're not satisfied with 1.6X crop factor you can always sell your lens on E-Bay for almost the price you paid for it.In conclusion, this is the best all around lens for the EF-S mount canon cameras available at this time. Go get it and start taking pictures."
2,slightly dis appointed,"After reading some very good reviews of this lens, I was very diaappointed to see dust inside the lens, including a fairly large spot, within days after getting it. The distortion around the edge was quite noticeable. With a lens costing this much and comparison to ""L"" lens, I never expected this. Canon needs to improve its quality control. I, too, believe that a lens hood should have been included at this price."
2,Strange book from a strange guy,"This book is a little strange, Heinrich Böll seems to me to be a somewhat strange man. Anyway the book is about the nazis, the cathologic religion and love. The main character Hans seems to always be in conflict with everyone. But he is quite outspoken, for one example he is playing with some Hitler jugend in nazi Germany and then he exclaimingly call them nazi-swine! Now that's kind of bold isn't it? This book reminded me about some of the works by Georges Bataille, in it's irrational selfdestructiveness."
1,just terrible,"This movie gives me nightmares. It is so unprofessional and cobbled together it's hard to believe that someone would market it with any seriousness. I suppose many two year olds would not mind this drivel, but if you plan to be anywhere near the tv when you play this one, then do not be surprised when you want to tear your hair out. The movie is random clips of trains, and to stretch it out, at the end there is a long scene with Santa and a Christmas parade. Save your money, or better yet look for a clip on youtube and get a good laugh in."
5,Love it!,I bought this low profile ceiling mount for the 16lb PowerLite Home Cinema 8350 Projector and it's perfect! It has a pivot point so the projector can be pointed in practically any direction. I wanted something secure for my relatively heavy Projector and having a 40lb weight limit this thing is solid! Easy to mount too!Cons: A little pricey when not on sale but a good investment if you want something secure for an expensive Projector.I do recommend this!
5,beware of the credit card scam,The product is what I ordered but the credit card is not. I signed up for the card to get a $30 discount and received a totally different card. I called and tried to get the problem resolved and basically was told sorry they won't do anything to fix the situation. I really had good luck with amazon until now.
3,Good for laypersons,"This collection is a decent collection and translation of the Apostolic Fathers for the general reader. I have two gripes though.One is that the Shepherd of Hermas is not included. I would imagine this was because of its length, but the collection seems woefully inadequate without it.The second is that the verse and chapter numbers are not given in a form that makes them the least bit usable when looking up passages that are referenced in other books.For research purposes, I would recommend the Loeb Classical Library editions or the excellent one volume reworking of the Lightfoot edition available from Baker Books edited by Michael Holmes.But if you're not out to be the next Jarislav Pelikan or J.N.D. Kelley, then this should do just fine for some interesting and inspiring reading."
1,NOT Stainless Steel,"This is a nicely designed piece of junk. After less than eight weeks, the bottom of ours began to corrode and soap leaked all over the countertops. It is absolutely NOT stainless steel, as advertised. AVOID!!"
3,I Need a Potty for a Boy,"I bought this because my current potty will not catch my boy's urine. The reviews for this said that is was good for a boy. It is not, unless your boy naturally hangs down. My boy points out. I miss the potty chair that I used for other son 13 years ago. It had a soft and perfect deflector that worked perfectly."
4,Simple Sturdy Ergonomic,"I almost passed over this potty for something with more bells and whistles. There were potties that converted into stepping stools and one that had a handle that played flushing sounds when depressed. $27 seemed a little expensive for two pieces of molded plastic (bowl and base) that made up the entire Bjorn potty get up. In the end, I'm happy with my Bjorn purchase. The simple design is easy to clean. My son is well supported in the ergonomic seat that has a wide base and rubber footings so I don't have to worry about him squirming and tipping over. The bowl is big enough to catch all of his deposits. Some of the potties I've seen have very small bowls which I'd imagine to be difficult targets for little behinds. My only gripe is that my little boy sometimes sprays over the splash guard and wets his clothes. So perhaps Bojorn should look into tweeking that part of their design."
4,Love the potty,We love this potty...it's not complicated like other pottys. It's easy to empty and clean...the seat seams comfortable for my daughters tiny butt... She loves to sit on it...glad we chose this one over the other cheap pottys.
5,Knows how to design a potty chair,"I have been trying to use the old potty chair I used for my older children, but just like it didn't work for them, it didn't work for my youngest son either. The old one had a small round shaped container, the baby bjorn has an oval shaped container which makes it possible to get it all in there and not all over the back of the chair. The splash gard is the perfect size for my little guy. It is very stable and doesn't tip over when he stands up. The fact that it doesn't turn into a step stool is just one more perk!!! He can't pull it apart!!! It's just the right size for my almost two year old. I read many reviews and went back and forth about this chair and the smaller one, and concluded that this one would be best considering the size of my little guy. He's not huge, but he is taller than most kids his age. I can't believe I waited until my last baby to find this chair!! Hindsight really is 20/20 isn't it!!!!"
2,What a dissappointment!,"I bought this potty based on the review of others. I purchased it for my son who will be turning three and was very hesitant about training on the normal toilet. This potty does have a larger seat, however, it's urine deflector is not tall enough and the urine leaks through the bottom. It is very easy to clean but I would recommend this potty for girls only."
5,Potty Chair,My son has just started potty training and he is very comfortable on this one. I love that you can take the inner part out and wash it. Very user friendly. The color is amazing.
3,Potty,This thing is ok! It's kind of bulky! I do however love the fact that there is a non slip grip ring around the bottom.
5,"Awesome potty, especially for boys!","LOVE this potty - it's so easy and comfortable for our son to sit on. Picked this one up after starting out with a Fisher Price potty that didn't have a splash guard (stupid me!), which was frustrating for everyone involved (trying to tell/help a 2-year old to ""point it down""... yeah, right) - as soon as our son tried this one out for the first time, his motivation level skyrocketed and he quickly became excited about peeing in the potty, instead of dreading it. The design and height are perfect, and the seat is easy to remove and empty (so much better than the ones where you have to slide the potty part out to empty it). Best potty ever!"
5,love it!,"I have one upstairs and one downstairs for my twins. I bought this becasue it does not have a stupid character on it, dowes not play stupid music, and doesn't look ridiculous. It looks like a little real toilet. Baby Bjorn is a great company."
3,Nice!,"I like the seat, it came quickly & is just like in the picture. Seems comfortable to my 21 mos old. The nice wide lip on the bowl looks like he won't be bothered with any edge cutting into his legs. Easy to clean!I'm not sure about the splash guard. He doesn't seem to like it, and it seems to get in the way when he pees standing up."
3,Good one but didn't work for us.,"My little two year old daughter is...well...LITTLE. I bought this potty based on the excellent reviews here and for the most part, it delivered.1. It was relatively inexpensive.2. No bells and whistles to distract.3. Easy to clean.But, being that my kiddo is a shrimp AND a girl, the molded splash guard thing kept poking her in a highly uncomfortable way when she'd try to sit on this thing and it got to the point where when she'd see this potty she'd scream. As a test, we got the pink girly version of the Summer 3 stage potty trainer and the screaming stopped.I'd recommend taking a look at this thing at a local store before buying. It's a pretty good product, it just didn't work for us."
3,"Nice potty, but geared toward boys","I bought this potty chair for my 2 1/2 year old daughter. I already had a Graco soft seat potty chair but I decided to buy this one to see if she liked it better. She did like it, but only to sit on as a novelty, she never actually made pee pee in it. The high lip in the front gave her some problems as she tried to sit down. I definitely think this seat is more ""boy friendly"", in the sense that it will prevent any misses. I'll keep it in my truck as an on the road emergency potty. I think she likes the Graco potty because it resembles the seat of a toilet and the BabyBjorn does not.Graco Soft Seat Trainer11/15 -Since my initial review, my daughter has used this potty and seems to like it. I do have one big problem with it, the inner potty bowl is too light weight. When she get's up quickly the inner potty bowl get's stuck to her behind and then drops. This can create quite a mess. They need to make the potty insert heavier."
4,My kid loves it,"Our three year old son immediately loved this chair (we ordered it in his ""favowit"" color green). He is fairly tall for his age but can still sit in it comfortably and it looks like shorter children could as well. My only complaint is that when he stands to tinkle, the urine inevitably hits the back of the seat and the design is such that it leaks underneath. It's easy for us to clean because we have mostly hardwood or tile floors but I can wouldn't recommend this for homes with mostly carpeting. I know our son likes to have his potty chair in various rooms in the house so it could make quite a mess. Other than that, though, it's lightweight, easy to transport if needed, easy to clean/dump in the toilet and my son loves it."
3,Slides around!,"I wanted to love this potty. I loved the BabyBjorn Little Potty, which we still use sometimes (our baby is 9mo; we have been putting him on the potty since he was 6 weeks old). But this potty just slides around on the floor so badly, and the rubber on the bottom does nothing at all. As he's pushing it backward with his feet, I'm trying to hold onto the thing and keep him from falling off, while he then tries to stand up...seriously, it's like a circus. We're using this on hardwood---maybe it would work better on some other surfaces? Dunno."
5,Great Training Potty!,Highly recommend this for training potty. Have a little girl and it has been so easy to use and teach with. Easy to clean and move around. No problems with splash back either.
3,"Not bad, but not great.","I bought this potty chair and the coordinating potty seat for my 2 year old son on the recommendation I read that the splash guard really worked. And I'm frustrated to madness that the splash guard really DOESN'T work for him unless he sits on it just right (a little to the right and leaning forward). So he can't sit in the seat comfortably and not make a mess.On the up side, it's easy to clean. Still looking for a good slash guard."
2,Not for boys!,"Started using this with my son when he was 6 months old. He refused to keep using it once he turned one and picked his froggy back up potty instead. That was fine with me, because around that time his urine started to leak over the splashguard and get all over the floor in front. This looks like a great potty and has awesome reviews, but it definitely did not work for us. The curved top of the splash guard allows the urine to flow right over and out of the potty onto the floor. Maybe if your son doesn't have a strong flow, then it would be fine. But, for us, we retired this seat very quickly after a few messes. I brought it back at 2 years, but we still had the same problem. It is super easy to clean if all the waste stays inside. This would probably be an excellent seat for a girl. My son seems to prefer the froggy seat though since it has little nubs sticking out each side to use as handles when sitting down and pushing back up to stand."
1,Worst rash I've ever seen,"I don't know if it's the pressure from my daughter sitting on the chair, or if she has an allergy to the plastic, but since we started potty training with this chair she has developed a horrible horrible rash. By process of elimination, and the fact that she has bright red stripes on her butt from where the plastic meets her bottom, we figured out it was the chair, and nothing else. She does have sensitive skin, but NOTHING would help her, and I tried EVERYTHING. We bought two and are returning both, and had to go with the safety first chair that has a cushion. If it weren't for the rash, I would give it a good review, because she liked it and used it, but the problems she has had are just ridiculous."
4,"Great for the boys, but wish it was also a stool","This works better then any chair I tried for my 18 month old son (3 total). The seat is long enought to fit his butt, and the cup is tall enough to stop the mess, the back keeps him from falling off the back, the rubber keeps the whole thing in place, simple clean up. However, I wish it also closed to a stool, my daughters did and she is 6 now. We still use it as a stool in the bathroom. It just seems that it would be nice if it grew with the kid."
2,DISAPPOINTING 5TH SEASON,"I have to agree with many reviewers that the 5th season is disappointing. We got to know Dr. Martin as uptight, rude and cold man and still accepted him as such, because he is also a brilliant devoted doctor and a hero at times.But what's hard to accept is the fact that the birth of his love child with Louisa, a cute baby boy, did not change him one bit. In fact it doesn't make sense that he seems even more pissed off than ever in the 5th season, and there are no moments of emotional connection between him and Louisa or him and the baby what so ever.On top of that, the 3 new characters in the 5th season; the new female doctor, Martin aunt Ruth and Louisa's mother are all rather unpleasant problematic women. And the new receptionist Morwenna is just a bore.I am still looking forward to the 6th season in 2013, but really hope that Dr. Martin will loosen up and change for the better and enjoy his life with the lovely Louisa and their son."
4,do the crime do the time.,"Here is a book that is direct and to the point about the law. As much as the""politicaly Correct"" want to twist the law this edition makes it clear, when where, and why the law was created. Let the lawyers have their fight in court,that is what we have courts for. Yet the book tells you what the laws is.It is your own Damn fault if you violate the law then have to do the time."
5,Guiding Readers and Writers,This was exactly the resource I was looking for. It will make my conferencing much easier and my planning for instruction in both reading and writing.
2,"If you like screaming teenie boppers, you'll love this CD","This recording is lifted from soundtracks from the Ed Sullivan show. Poor substitute for the original studio tracks, plus the annoying, screaming teenie boppers get in the way. After you listen to this CD you will understnd why Ritalin was invented."
1,TOO much Ed Sullivan and Noise. Not good music.,I was very disappointed in this CD. I liked the idea of having a variety of British songs but the quality wasn't there. I wouldn't recommend this CD to anyone.
1,"Good book, but too pricey!!","This is a very good book for juveniles, but too pricey ($19.99) rates it a 1 star. Free for this public domain (U.S.) book would rate it a 4 or 5. Get it elsewhere."
3,Good but flawed.,"First let me admit that I have yet to hear the original cast album. I have seen the film version though many times - I watch it at least twice a year. Good performances all around - Spiner, though, sounds as if he is doing the films' ""John Adams."" Sadly I wish Mr. Hingle was more like the films Franklin. There is ""something"" missing in his performance, that is not all attributal to his vocal quality - the wiseness that has been portrayed by other performers doesn't come through.I enjoy having this as part of my collection, however I wish I had purchased the Original Broadway cast instead."
1,Aw Man! I wish it was the original!,"I have been a huge fan of the original cast of 1776 and have all the tracks memeorized.....ok I'm a geek. I bought the original cast recording a long time ago and played it non-stop. I did notice it had some flaws like echoes in the recording. I found the 1997 version and wondered how it sounded. I read people's reviews and thought wow this sounds like it would be a huge success! I do admit the songs sounded decent right up until ""The Lees of Old Virginia"" which is my favorite song in the musical. I loved the original (Ron Holgate)'s version and his character better. I heard this version and wanted to laugh. No offense, but the guy sounds like he has a clothes-pin clamped on his nose and he is on the toilet! I'm a public vocal performer myself so I know how tough it is, but come on, you're on Broadway now. He may have the advantage of better recording equipment, but he can't project with the same resonance at all! Ronald Holgate all the way!!!"
5,"Wow, what a show!","I have been listening to musicals for years and I must say that 1776 is one of the best. It is certainly not Stephen Sondheim or Andrew Lloyd Webber but it has charm.The script is incredible and some argue that the music isn't even needed but there is a great emotional journey that one can take if they allow themselves to really be there with the show. It is worth the money, if for no other reason than to explore this magnificent musical that not only reminds us of, but creates American history.The performances by Brent Spiner, Linda Emond, Gregg Edelman, and Michael Cumptsy are superb. Though Spiner as Adams doesn't have the same vocal quality as the original Adams (William Daniels) he shines a new light on Adams and really brings the character to life."
4,"Great Cast Album, Minus Franklin","I completely agree with several of the other reviews of this CD posted here. While there are some great improvements over the original cast recording, Pat Hingle's Ben Franklin is often marble-mouthed and simply unpleasant to listen to.However, this only really affects a few songs (""The Egg"" in particular), and ultimately the CD is well worth having."
2,Deceptive Advertising,"The way this ad is presented, it appears that you are getting all the scarves - 5 in total. But the price is per scarf. I may have chosen a different one than one received had I knew what I was ordering. They should state that the price is for only ONE scarf. For that reason, I gave 2 stars. The actual scarf is OK. Not crazy about the fabric."
2,Quality Issue?,"I don't know what happen. Maybe my babies are sensitive or allergic to the baby lotion, but I thought the baby lotion are Hypoallergenic and safe for baby skin. Both my kids got rash after using the baby lotion. They also got issues with the baby wash as well."
2,Should make a fragrance-free version,This was a great deal but unfortunately doesn't work for my baby's sensitive skin. It has perfume and coloring and the pediatrician said not to use it on her. I wish they would make a hypo allergenic fragrance and dye free version for babies with sensitive skin.
2,Overpowering scent,"How does this lotion have so many good ratings? Just because it's been around forever? The smell is completely overpowering. Everyone should know, the less chemicals the better for a baby, and if it has such a strong smell that means there are unnecessary chemicals in it. Completely prefer Aveeno's fragrance free baby lotion over this."
4,The pleasure of reading.,This is one of those books that makes a person feel so lucky they know how to read. I never wanted it to end.
1,A major dud. It put me to sleep over and over again.,"I was not at all impressed with this book. In fact, I was not able to get very far into it. I just did not find the story to be particularly interesting. The story moved far too slowly to be interesting. In my opinion your time would be better spent watching TV than reading this novel."
3,good quality for the price,"The pants are comfortable and assuming that they hold up with use, they are fairly priced."
5,Just Fine For a Boy,"We have used this for our son for 2 years now and all we had to do was to tell him to point his ""pee pee"" down and he does it each time he uses it, now just to go ""poo poo"" though.It is easy for him to be able to pick up and put onto the toilet himself because of the handle as well. We bought the stool with it when we purchased this."
5,Great training seat,I got this for my 3-year-old son who is potty training. I wanted a potty seat he could get on and off of easily as well as be comfortable and keep the pee from splattering everywhere. This one fits the bill perfectly. He's not scared to use it and he fits on it very well. The splash guard seems to do its job as long my son keeps his aim in the toilet! I would recommend this seat to other mothers of little boys and girls. It's been worth the money spent on it!
1,We don't live in Germany,"Not impressed and am returning tomorrow. The little wings you have to dial out barely hold the seat in place. Maybe it works for older toilets or german toilets...but not mine. If the little wings came down more, then it would hook under the lip of the seat. But this will be returned. Got it at babies r us and I will just look for a permanent seat that won't fly off while my kid is getting on or off of it."
5,What a great product,"My DD loves this seat. She was only 10mths when we got it, but the first time we put here there she was happy. Now she picks it up by herself and would sit there forever if she could. Easy to clean!!!"
5,Love it!,We have two of these and love them. I tried to use the little potty that sits on the floor but I prefer this one. It is much less messy. We have a boy and the front of the seat is high so it keeps the pee in the toilet for the most part. Would highly recommend this!
5,Worth the money -clean potty,"I originally bought this potty because my oldest child's potty trainer was too big for my toddler, which scared her. I was gritting my teeth paying $[...] for a seat, but I told myself I could use our other potty seat (with Dora characters) for car trips or something. Forget it! Now that we've been using the Bjorn for a month, that other seat is going in the trash and if we need another seat, we'll buy a Bjorn again. Our old seat was always filthy and somehow managed to be dripping when you pulled it off the seat. The Bjorn potty is well designed and is not messy at all. I like the handle, so you can pull it off the potty without touching the seat. However, I can't imagine trying to hang this seat. It is not flat on the bottom at all."
5,Perfect!,"Perfect fit, easy to use, my 3 yr old can place the seat on the toilet himself and can sit on it with the help of a small step stool. We rinse it off and hang it on the back of his bathroom doorknob. The seat doesn't wiggle at all, which I could see being a huge issue with some of the other over the toilet seats. Worth the extra money."
2,Not for Boys!!!!,"After a couple hours of reading reviews I bought this seat. Many of the other product reviews said ""not for boys"". With this seat your boy would have to lean very far forward to not get pee everywhere. I also choose this because it adjusts on the bottom to fit long toilet seats, it fit the seat well. Another problem for me was the size of the hole. I have a big 2 year old and couldn't wipe him well. If you have a petite girl this will work for you!Amazon made it very easy to return this product at no cost to me:)"
5,Best Potty Seat Out There,"I went through so many potty seats when training my children. For my boy, having the shield build-in was key. At one time, I had one with a removable shield and it kept falling in the toilet. This one also has an adjuster for different sized toilets. It fits long bowls as well as the smaller ones. It was very durable as well."
5,Attention to detail makes all the difference....,They thought about the little things that would make this better than the competition. Kept the price reasonable. Very happy.
5,"convenient, easy to travel with, comfy and safe to sit on big potty",Bought this as a travel seat even though they have other ones that fold. Am happy we got this on b/c she's used to the Bjorn little potty. This one was an easy transition to the big potty and she felt secure sitting on it by herself. Takes some room in a suitcase but it's worth it since it's an easy transition and she liked it.
5,Perfect potty seat,"Very easy to clean. This fits on every toilet securely--I've seen some cheap, wobbly ones that never seem to sit properly on the seat. Also, the molded seat is easy for the child to feel secure on. I have two boys. On the cheap seats, little boys tend to pee over the front, but not on this one."
3,Great product if you have the proper toilet seat,"We are working on potty training my daughter and she loves sitting on this seat vs. sitting on a stand alone training potty. She likes being a big girl and sitting the same place that mom and dad sit. The downside to this seat is that unless you have toilet seats that are totally flat, the ""attachment"" pieces won't fit you toilet seat. So instead of returning this, my husband went out and spent $40 more for each of the toilets in our house so that this seat would fit and not slide around."
5,Awesome!!,"Love this thing. Tried the babybjorn potty chair first and my 3 1/2 yr old said it hurt him, so we tried this next. Fits perfect on the toilet he feels safe sitting on it and the splash guard is great for boys. Don't mess with potty chairs just go straight to this."
3,"Liked it, but defective","After 3 weeks of use maybe 1-2x/day, the rubber handle is separating from the rest of the potty. I just began hanging it from a hook, so maybe that had something to do with it. This isn't a problem that I read in any of the reviews I perused, and the instructions on the box say to hang it on a hook. I am returning it and hoping for better luck with the replacement.Other than that, my daughter loves this. She's 18 mo old, 21 lbs, and fit it quite well. We only managed to catch her doing her business using it once though. The product fit very well on my elongated toilet seat and was easy to adjust."
4,Perfect Seat for the Feat,My 22-mo. old loves to hang out while we patiently wait for the results. Great seat b/c my child is no longer scared of the toilet (he used to be afraid to fall in w/o the seat). Fits great and is easy to use and store. Highly recommend for all those entering the world of potty training and good luck.
5,3 year old daughter loves this trainer!,"My nearly 3 year old daughter had been rejecting 2 different potty chairs, and was hesitant to sit on the ""big potty"" after nearly falling in the water. This toilet trainer sits securely on my elongated toilet bowl and is very stable when she climbs on and off, easing her fears. I am very pleased with it and would recommend it highly."
3,"Lightweight, but definitely Not the best shingle remover","We did a tear off on a 12 square asphalt shingle roof, with two layers. The shingles on one side were in really bad shape, basically disintegrating.The Beast from Malco worked the best of the three we tried. The balck and yellow shingle removal tool from ""Home Cheapot"" worked pretty well, second best to the Malco Beast. The Bully Tools Roof Ripper worked the least well of the three. After 5 minutes with the tools, nobody wanted to use it."
3,A great idea gone flat,"The concept and basic story line are gripping enough. But the problem that detracts from really relishing this book is a complete absence of editing of any kind. Seriously! If you value the concepts of spelling, grammar, case sensitivity and basic word-processing formatting, beware! That's how this book really scared me! I do note that as of this writing (April 5, 2001) it's now back-ordered. I can only hope it's due to another (corrected) printing."
4,Quirky,"I'm not very familiar with Thomas Newman's work. I've seen Finding Nemo, but I can't remember the music from it, and I haven't seen any other films with music that he composed. However, if all of Newman's work is of the same standard as this soundtrack, I'd definitely want to listen to more.One word came into my head when listening for the first time: quirky. I'm not even sure what that word means, but it sounds like the right word to describe the soundtrack: out of the ordinary, wacky, weird, original, wonderful, unexpected, delightful.It will definitely bring out the child in you..."
4,Good for a little camera,"This is a great camera for travel and everyday events because of its small and convenient size. We bought it to replace our bulkier Sony DSC-F707. The large screen is wonderful! The video feature is a lot of fun but due to the small size it is hard to take a steady video. The battery meter is very useful as it tells you how much time you have left. The main downside with this camera is the flash. It doesn't work well in very dark conditions for distant or even slightly distant shots. If it weren't for the flash, I would have given this a rating of 5 stars. This is overall a good camera.For more serious digital photography, we prefer to use the Sony DSC-F707 as it has a better flash and zoom. However, it is too bulky to carry around."
2,"2-year-old loved it, it shorted out in two days","After two days of playing with it, the thing started cutting in and out. Changed the batteries, no help. Didn't pay enough for it to bother with returns so the product goes in the loss column."
2,Maxim Fire Apparatus,"Great book. Having worked at Maxim Motors as a Draftsman, This brought back fond memmories.The technical aspect is accurate. The historical data is correct, and the photos are authentic. If you are a fire truck buff you must read this book."
3,Meh...it's ok,"hmm.. i looked forward to this cd for months after hearing it was coming out, then it finally did and i was so excited. Much to my suprise, i liked 2 songs on the cd and thought the rest was garbage. about 3 months later i've given it another listen, and i like it a little better now. It still isn't the Rammstein we all know and love, but there is always hope for another classic cd** stick to that straight hard drum beat guys...that's your sound."
4,Amerika,"Overall, I love this album. There is nothing really for me to add that hasn't been said. It. Effing. Rocks.Now, here is my opinion on the song: AmerikaMuch of the lyrics suggest that, insead of being copy-cats and bashing bush or the war the whole time, they are expressing discontent about the US in general. We are imposing and we are powerful. Even if we are not enemies, we are imposing our culture through business. Coka-cola and mcdonalds are taking over the world. We have less of problem with this commercialism because we don't have a prominent native culture to ruin.Anyway:At the worst ist's a political song, which are very popular right now.At the best it's a commentary on much more.Enjoy it either way."
3,Not as good as it could have been,"Since I'm obsessed, whether or not to buy is not the issue. After listening to the excerpts on amazon, I totally know that this isn't the CD I'm going to be ""rocking"" out to in my car, with the exception of Mein Teil & Amerika (which will probably get on my nerves after the 50th time listening to it). This CD definitely shows their age and I hate that, next thing you know Till will have his own spoken word albums (like Henry Rollins) and all their music will be slow and devoid of any electronic experimentation. There are no risks taken on this CD, and it's a total let down since they had 3 years to work on it. Having no edge, and with every song sounding too similar, maybe this is a sign that their time is fleeting. But I still love them just the same."
5,Sehr gut!,"Ich weiß nie, was man in einem Rezensieren für ein CD sagen soll. Mir gefiel ""Reise, Reise"" sehr viel. Die Lieder sind ein bisschen dunkel, aber das ist Teil des Spaßes. Meine Deutsch ist nicht gut, und dieses CD hat mich geholfen."
3,Half an album in my mind.,"Rammstein had a hard album to follow up after Mutter but whilst the tracks on this 2004 onslaught are not up to the apogee of some of the tracks on Mutter, this album isn't bad, but maybe could be described as just half an album. Favourite tracks have to be America and Moscow, America's lyrics are amusing. But some of the other tracks do sound like fillers, and I find you just end up skipping them."
5,"Precision, clarity and beauty","Perhaps the hardest feat of any good writer is telling the truth. This book - every single piece - does just that. And it's not complicated or arbitrary. If you've ever felt like you don't really understand poetry, then take a look at this little book. The light bulb will go off. It's not that it's poetry for beginners; it's just that it represents how clear, lyrical and unambiguous good poems can be. There's a kind of magical focus to it. Everything seems just so, but still real and breathing. None of it ever feels contrived.What a wonderful mind, I thought. How curious and thoughtful and full of life."
4,The Album Is Better Than The Movie!,"I saw the movie--hated it. But I loved the music. I didn't go out and buy the CD till about a year later though. I was sitting at home, listening to music on the ""Music Choice"" channel our cable system offers...when mine ears heard some butt kicking techo!! It was ""Leave U Far Behind"", and when I saw what soundtrack it was, I knew I had to get it. Bought the soundtrack and liked just about everything on it. The one that really disappointed me though was the crappy Immortals change of the Kombat theme. I still listen to the original Kombat soundtrack for that one. Megalomaniacal and Leave U Far Behind are my two favorites. I highly suggest it if techo/industrial is your thing."
2,the whole story,"Graphically Dungeon Siege is a stunning game. Story wise - there pretty much is none and the gameplay is very repetitive. I would recommend buying it if you don't mind playing something just for the graphics, otherwise I'd look elsewhere.One thing to keep in mind, there is no support for this game. Gas Powered Games offers a email address that they do not answer and Mickeysoft offers a Faq page that doesn't even display half the time (no email support that I could find). If you have any problems (and I've had quite a few), you are on your own."
2,Better wait for Icewind Dale 2 & Neverwinter Nights!,"I purchased Dungeon Siege in order to try out my upgraded system...I agree, it's visually stunning but it's both a bore and a chore to play after a while (it may be different when it's a multiplayer session, as I was going solo instead). I guess I'm an old D&D gamer type, I like the idea of classes and such. Also, however, I prefer games with a modicum of plot and halfway interesting NPC's, neither of which is found in Dungeon Siege. After a while, I just stopped caring about the game. (I've since sold it and deleted the game on my hard drive, there was no point in continuing.)If you like Diablo, you'll probably like DS to a certain point, but if you want something more just wait for Icewind Dale 2 and Neverwinter Nights to hit the shelves (which will be in 4-5 weeks for ICWD2 and 6-7 weeks for NWN). This isn't a very professional or polished review like some of the others, but it cuts to the chase."
2,Poor Game by Big Game Maker,I pre order this item something I will never do again. I will wait for real reviews on a product. Ok it's a two disk cd set so i figured at least 60- 90 hours of play time nope I bet the game in 28 hours. My one big complaint is you don't really control your charater like in Baldur Gate. The most you really to is click where you want them to go. They Auto fight. Story was pretty weak. Never buy a pre order game again is all i have to say
4,What dungeon,"Pretty nice graphics, Not much charecter development. You juz pick what you want to kill with and that's it. Lots of different weapons though, with many different magical bonuses. Even unique items. Only thing that kept me interested. After playing the single player storyline, there's a bigger online storyline."
2,adventurers into an assembly line...,"The game graphics and atmosphere are cool, and I confess thet they kept me playing for hours a few times. The storyline is laughable. After a while you will find yourself wondering if you are still playing or doing some work you have become strangely addicted to."
1,OMG,I hope I can get my money back. I can't believe that so many people gave this game a good review. Mindless clicking. The good graphics and animations can't save it.
2,Good graphics but boring,"This game has great graphics, but I expected the fighting sequences to be more exciting. It reminds me of Gauntlet Legends in where you keep killing horde after horde of monsters. It got very boring after a while. The graphics are great, but I don't recommend buying it."
2,"Sorry, But It Just Doesn't Cut It","I bought this in a moment of weakness when there were no new first person D&D; type games out there. I had been burned by other 3rd person games, but decided to see what someone else besides the Baldur's Gate people could do with things.The game was very linear and to me, very annoying to play. I had problems with the party AI and did not like that I could not veer off the path to any extent. I got maybe halfway through it and quit. Not my cup of tea."
3,almost enough to miss sleep,"I originally bought this game because it was the only one that would play on my pre-historic machine and yes, I did for a brief moment become addicted. Anyone thinking of buying this game I would describe it as a soap opera. The content is pleasing enough but just as you are starting to realise there is not much to this experience, a cliff hanger is thrown up to keep your attention chained for that little bit longer. It is very easy to play and the enemies are not to much trouble, it moves very nicely and would probebly make a good introduction, but it is not challenging or thought provoking. My advice, save your money and by a better computer so you can play baulders gate."
3,"It's good, but...","...it is repetative. While the concept is wonderful, the 3D graphics fairly impressive, there are no load times going from area to area, and the skills program is great--the game is repetative.The entire game is comprised of nothing but fighting your way through a linear map, with occasional towns along the way to sell your stuff. If you are looking for a game that will keep you captivated in its origionality and story-line, this is not the game for you. If, on the other hand, you enjoy nothing but combat (a la Diablo), and story line and origionality are less-important, then you may find this game of value."
1,not digital,not digital so no good in usa. the seller did not want to return my money. it was my mistake for not making sure it was not analogue so I let it slide even though amazon came to my aid and allowed me to return it. the seller is deceptive so do not buy anything from him
1,NOT WORTH IT!,"Item was not current with digital FCC regulations, only could pick up one channel. Seller made it impossible to return, had to ship to Canada within 7 days using only the postal service and must have an authorization number. Cost $35.00-$45.00 just to ship back. NOT WORTH IT TO BUY!"
2,Can't Hear - Frustrating,"The mic works great, we haven't had any complaints with sound quality on our customers' end. On the other hand, since we haven't been able to hear them worth crap, who knows what they really think. It's especially painful when we've had to ask them to repeat him/her self for the 18th time and they say, ""you know what, this is too painful. I'll place my order with somebody else."" I'm definitely going out to buy a new headset. What a waste."
4,BENNETT AT HIS BEST,"The continuing saga of a mother and her two daughters.Mrs Baines is the middle aged boisterous woman who runs rule of the family business as her invalid husband lies in wait of his demise.The Baines` have two young daughters-Constance ( intelligent and stable)and Sofia (beautiful and flighty).the ideal of the story was to examine how one would perceive ""a Mrs Baines"" if you were to encounter her on the street or in a cafe.would you see her as an old rude lady?Would you be able to invision the possibility that in her younger days she was as Constance and Sofia are? And ther lies the basis of the story-how does one go from being a beautiful,fun loving girl to a boisterous old lady.Well as the story delves further into their lives we witness everything that happens and therefore shapes their lives.In real life events, whether large or small will determine our next path in life and here we get to see where they end up.A terrific read for something written in 1908."
2,It breaks,"Great idea, and it is wonderful when it works. After 5 months, I have had two exchanges with no real hope I will ever have a working unit. Costs are mounting up. Service is friendly, but it doesn't help when the product is fundamentally not ready for prime time."
2,Great technology marred by crash prone behavior...,"well, my first Tivo unit came DOA - apparently the hard drive cable was not connected to the system board. Tivo/Phillips people sent me a refurbished unit (in only a week - very timely) - the new unit worked for 2 days, then crashola. it tells me politely to wait for 3 hours whilst it attempts to recover. ""A serious system error has occurred."" it warns me. I wait. nothing happens. i call Tivo. they tell me to ""let it sit for 24 hours to rebuild itself."" it sits. i wait. nothing. now i will call again, wasting another $14 to ship the unit back to them to replace. this time i am going to ask for a new replacement unit, not a refurbished one. perhaps this time it will work. when it is working, it is phenomental. when it is working, that is. which for me has been two days over the past three weeks. sigh."
2,"Get Replay. No Monthly fees, better guide","I tried both, replaytv is clear winner.1) 30 Seconds skip button 2) Ability to pad shows. 3) Superior Channel guide 4) No monthly fees to pay"
1,"Concept great, hardware problem-plagued","I've had two failed units so far since my purchase in February. The first one had problems within a week of purchase (freezing up literally every few minutes), and Amazon was wonderful about taking it back and shipping me a new one. The second one suffered hard drive failure by early July; I have shipped it back to Tivo & am waiting for unit #3. Because I'm still in my 1-year warranty period, I will receive a refurbished unit for $99.95. When it's working, it is wonderful, but this succession of failed units really makes me wonder about long-term reliability. After my warranty is up, will I be SOL? I also regret buying the ""lifetime"" subscription to the Tivo service because the duration of the ""lifetime"" now seems somewhat questionable (supposedly the subscription will transfer to a new unit as long as the same model is purchased, but do I really want to be a repeat customer?)"
4,"So far, better than I hoped!","I just received my TiVo yesterday. From what I'd read here, I was really concerned about how the setup would go. To my amazement, it couldn't have been easier. So far I really like it. I wasn't sure it would even work with my digital cable service, but that isn't even an issue! I think I'm gonna love it."
4,Kenwood speakers,"Got these speakers for my husband for Xmas. He was pretty happy. Only problem is they didn't come with any wiring, which surprised him."
3,Not exactly what I expected,"Even though the text within the book is perfectly fine, the words on the book cover have been cut off and makes the book look a little tacky and poorly put together."
5,An Intense and Original Take On the Haunted House,"This book is so different from the usual haunted house fare. There really isn't much that serves as a tangible reason for the house being so evil, it just apparently is. And it's a vicious house for certain, preying on psychological fear rather than manifesting itself as a poltergiest or apparition. Things just ""happen"" in or around the house, disturbing things. Lives are ruined and that is the only motiff that emerges. It's not a singular entity with just murder in mind. It wants to cause pain to its victims on an inner level and that is extremely frightening in concept. The novel is like a constant mind rape of the characters involved and it is so very delicious in its malice. One of the top 10 horror novels I have ever read and way more intense than Shirley Jackson's The Haunting of Hill House or Richard Matheson's Hell House. A must read for any fan of the horror genre or any new home owner."
2,Meh,Was not what I expected. Didn't really catch my attention very well. Very slow book took me some time to finish it. If it wasnt for the fact that I have to finish books I start I wouldn't have finished it. I felt nothing for the characters but it was well written. Not a fan of the book but Im sure some people would like the story.
2,Not that great...,"I guess the bottom line here is this book wasn't scary and it wasn't much of a mystery. Yes, there's some kind of evil presence but I kept waiting for the story to develop and it just never happened. I have to agree with the other review here about the need to kill pets, I was about to put the book down after the numerous animals killed but then it said something about how no more pets died. Skip this book, I'm glad I bought my coyy used since it's going in the giveaway bag."
2,Mildly interesting at best..........,"I'm not at all familiar with Siddons' other work, but was recommended this book by a fellow literary enthusiast. I was remarking how great a book Hell House by Richard Matheson was, & it was suggested that I read The House Next Door.While well written, the book is incredibly dry, boring & extremely contrived. It's clearly a feeble attempt at a ""scary"" novel by someone unaccustomed to the genre. Again, Siddons is obviously a great writer in terms of style/skill, but this novel was bad. The two stars are merely given as a nod to her ability as a writer, rather than the story itself.I have no idea why Stephen King would have such great things to say about this book, as it is certainly not in league with even his worst effort. The only people I imagine would be pleased with this book are those that do not typically read horror/supernatural tales, but are in an ""adventurous"" mood."
2,mediocre,"The callow lives of a complacent couple get shaken up when the house next door goes bad. As haunted house stories go, this is not particularly scary and compares unfavorably with ""The Haunting of Hill House"" and ""The Shining."" The book's most notable feature is its portrayal of a bland suburban couple who manage to be offensive and banal at the same time. Are there really people like this? At the end, I wondered if Siddons deliberately created two unlikable people to create a sense of ambivalence in the reader about the effect of the house on their little sheltered lives.By the last page, I was simultaneously rooting for the House Next Door and for the book to end."
2,Not very scary,"This is the first book by this author that I have read and probably will not read another by her. First, the book was not the least bit scary. Second, I found her phrasing somewhat annoying and pretentious. (Silence always ""spun out"" across the telephone line or a conversation.) Third, the characters were also pretentious and were high society snobs. Yes, there are ""evil"" doings at the house next door but let's go have martinis at the club or take a three hour lunch and have Bloody Marys ""rich and thick and sprinkled with snips of fresh dillweed, in outsized frosted glasses"". Blech. The story itself was OK and kept me interested enough to finish the book to see how it ended."
1,Boring!,"This was not a scary book. I have read scary books, and this was not one of them. The majority of The House Next Door is spent on the social culture of a tight-knit neighborhood and not on anything frightening. The fact that this was written in 1978 was the most interesting thing about this book. No cell phones, records in the stereo, etc. If you like horror, do yourself a favor and avoid this one."
3,My Side of the Mountain,"Sam Gribley is a nice kid. I don't know how old he is. He runs away from New York to the Catskill mountains. He builds a tree fort in the woods. He also builds all kinds of stuff: fishing rod, fishing lure, etc... Toward the end of the book his dad sees him. I reccommend this book to other sixth graders who like adventure and outdoor survival books. Jean Craighead George is smart writer who writes about the outdoors."
5,wonderful story,This is one of the great children's story classics. Especially for a child who loves the outdoors. I think that this my be the first of three following the story characters
5,one of my favorite books,"I don't know where I originally got this book but I still have it and this is the second time I have bought one for gifts. I gave it to 2 of my nephews for gifts and they have enjoyed them as much as I did...It is a story of a young boy who takes off on his own to live in the mountains. After reading it, one of my nephews said he wanted to do just that and have a hawk and live in a hollow tree, too! It makes the young, and the young at heart, want to go out on adventures and take life by the horns! Have fun reading it and pass it on to others to enjoy!"
3,My Side of the Mountain,"One summer day Sam Gribely makes a house out of a tree by burning the insides out. During the time that he lives there he meets up with losts of obstacles he has to overcome. While living with only aimals in the Catskill Mountains, he remembers and thinks about all of the obstacles and notices all of the inexperiance and joy of every minor success."
1,STUNK ON ICE,This book was so stupid. I read it in 6th grade for an assignment. So I had to read it all but I could barely get through the 1-4 pages. A book about a kid who lives in a tree? I tell ya where do they get these ideas!THIS BOOK STUNK!!!!!!!!!!!!
4,My Side of the Mountain-A Page Turning Novel,"I would recommend My Side of the Mountain to everyone who reads because this is a very realistic, page turning, survival story which also provides great information if you were ever stranded in the wilderness as was the main character, Sam."
3,Mrs. Brown's 4th Grade Class,"My Side of the MountainBy Jean Craighead GeorgeThis is a survival and adventure book. It has many unexpected parts. The boy, Sam Gribley, and his pet falcan, Frightful, have to survive on thier own after Sam runs away to the old, family farm. While Sam was hiking he met and made an interesting new friend. I enjoyed learning tips on how to survive in the wilderness. I recommend this book to kids who like survival and adventure books."
3,My Side of the Mountain for Idiots,"It's interesting how some people have such an ibility to survive in the wild like Sam did. Now that you think of it do you think that ANY twelve year old boy that wasn't raised by wolves could survive alone in the winter at the top peak of a mountain in the catskills? I think not!!! Bears, lack of food and shelter oh please! It's kinda boring but it's a cool story and it's good for those rainy days, but I wouldn't suggest buying it at all- go to the library! ..."
2,Aaron Spriggs' Online Review for My Side of the Mountain,"I read the book My Side of the Mountian by Jean Craighead George. The book starts out with this boy Sam Gribly who wants to run away from his family with only some flint and $40.00 because he feels his family is to large. With a family of 11 I would too. So he goes to find his grandpa's farm. He finds it. And then he hollows out a old hemlock tree for his house. During the course of the book he makes a chimny in his house so he can warm it during the harsh winter, and he makes a couple friends too. This was a kind of boring book. I gave it 2 stars because at some points he sounds like he is going insane because he keeps on hearing his bird talk to him and he talks to himself often too."
2,My side of the Mountain,I think the book My side of the Mountain was a very good book and I enjoyed it very much.The book had alot of action and frightining situations.The book was a very good survival story and I recommend it to anyone who likes survival stories.
5,I want a treehouse!!!,This book is by far the best book for teenage boys. This is exactly what they dream about doing on their own!!
3,Sam's Mountain,Sam is boy who runs away from home why he runs he thinks his apartment it too crowded. He goes to his grandpa's farm to the Catskill Mountains and he stays there for a year and he gets a duckhawk and names if Frightful. At the end of the book his parents come and visit and they decide to live with him.
4,My Side of the Mountain Review By Spencer Martin,"4 StarsOk, I am a 11 year old kid who is reading this book in class and I Love it! It is an absolute awesome book for nature lovers especially.The story is about a boy named Sam gribley who tells his father one day that he is going to run away. His father doesn't think he will succeed and do it though. He does it. The book then tells how Sam survives in his Great Grandfather's land. It tells us this by saying what foods he eats, what friends he makes, and what his shelter is. Can Sam survive winter? Can he stay alone in the woods? Read and maybe buy this book to find out!I highly recommend this book because it is a book about how you can survive in the nature and has a great main idea.Genre: I think the genre of theis book is realistic fiction and adventure because it is very adventurous and could really happen."
4,My Side of the Mountain by D2,"If you're the type of person who likes survival novel books, this is the book for you! This book is called My Side of the Mountain by Jean Craighead George. The main characters in the book are Sam Gribley, a boy, Frightful, a bird companion, the Baron Weasel, who is also friends with Sam, and Bando, a man who helps Sam. Sam Gribley decides to go out to live alone. There, he is independent at living. Will Sam Gribley ever return home to his family in NYC? I liked this book because it's a first person narrative so it gives more description about the animals, setting, and what he's doing. I also liked the book because I like books about kids, especially a book about a kid and his pet. I highly recommend this book for ages 7 and up."
1,my opinion,I dislike the book because it didn't really make sence to me.It was really boring and I was not interested.So don't pick up the book.
1,Hideous! One of the worst books I have ever read!,"I read this ""book"" when I was in the sixth grade. Even then I knew that this was literature at its very worst. Bland charachters, dull plot, you name it! From the moment I saw a chapter entitled ""In which I find some interesting plants"" I knew I was in for it. Recomended for people with the rare disease colestites which keeps its victims awake for years. This will put you to sleep!"
2,I thought that this book was ok exept for the survivel part.,As i was reading this book i thought to myself does this book surve a purpus i think not. It wasnt that bad exept for the survivel methods they would never work i meen where did he get all that stuff anyway. Thanks for your time G-dog
3,"""Jake likeeeish""","I thought that the book ""My Side of the Mountain"" was good and bad in one package.The reason why I think that it is good is because it reminded me of what I used to pretend to do with my friends.I also thought it was neat how he lived like making fishing poles and making a house out of a tree and making a fire place.The reason I thought it was bad because it was really fake and unrealistic also because I don't think it would be very easy to train a falcon.THAT Is IT !!!"
2,You can't find the products !!!,"I found the book very interesting and very detailed. But he refuses to be a fan of the glycemic index, but uses a lot of their arguments to verify his own diet. I read the Glucose Revolution at the same time and find very similar statements in both books. But the greatest fault in this book lies in the problem that you can't find the products he uses for his drinks anywhere, at least not with Twinlab, as he mentiones. The products are discontinued for the most part. So I don't know how all the other readers can sing the highest praises when it is so hard to accomplish one of the most important parts of the diet. A interesting book, but hard to follow. The Glucose Revolution is as scientifically proven, but easier to follow in every day life."
1,Too much like his other books,"This book seemed to repeat many of the same ideas and thoughts Mr. Haas talked about in his previous books. It has some interesting ideas, but lacked originality. It was hard to get through the entire book without yawning."
2,not what I had hoped for,"It wasn't as thorough as I had hoped... no ""plan"", or recipes...I need everything mapped out, the first 'Eat to Win' is fab, but my edition is in storage, I thought I could just order a new one, and get going.The Amazon service was GREAT!I resorted to going to a Barnes & Noble to search out another 28 diet plan, with recipes...found one, we'll see ... the original 'Eat to Win' is the perfect 28 day starter diet..."
3,CANNOT register star and NO RESPONSE from customer service!,I paid almost $10 for this horse (and twice as much for the dragon) and we cannot register a star. Apparently shiningstars.com has had an issue with this and they aren't fixing it. I emailed them TWICE and they will not respond. Thanks for disappointing my child!
2,Horrible Transfer of a good Holiday slasher.,There really is no excuse for this terrible transfer. Poor picture transfer is soft and barely above my VHS version. The sound is even worse-an annoying buzz runs thru the last half of the movie?! I tried to find info about the company that released this but couldn't. They must know what a embarrassing job that was done.Bottom line is this is a rip-off even at half the price. If you have a VHS version keep it and save your $$$.
1,False Hope,"I fear that this book will be misleading to parents. The authorseems to be under the assumption that schools profit from labelingchildren as disabled. They do not. In my experience they do everything in their power to keep boderline children from receving sspecialized services. It costs them more money and they have to hire more professionals. The author tries to convince parents that a diagnosis of pervasive developmental disorder is the same as a diagnosis as autism. This is not true. If parents decide to read this biased book, they should start with chapter 4 first because it disscusses some of the reasons for children to be talking late."
1,This book is CRAP!,"I was hesitant to read this because a speech langauge therapist had not written it. As a speech language therapist, I was HORRIFIED by the content of this book. Every child that was listed in this book sounded as if he/she had some type of austism. He even had the nerve to disvalue the early interventionist of the world. Early intervention is the KEY! It is not NORMAL for children to begin talking at 3 or 4.Please do NOT read this book. It is full of mistruths. If you want to read something about late talkers read a book written by a speech language therapist or a linguist."
2,Please stop doing covers,"With Jessica Simpson's ascent to major-stardom, her music seems to somehow have gotten left behind in the dust.. What is going ON with all these weak covers of Berlin, Robbie Williams and now - Nancy Sinatra? Sure the country twist is interesting, but in the end ""Boots.."" is an incomplete, badly produced track which does not take advantage of Jessica's surprisingly strong voice and vocal ability. Is this the same singer who released strong hook-laden tracks like ""Irresistable"" and ""I Wanna Love you Forever"" - what happened? Let's hope her next album is original material. These covers are not doing her justice."
5,Best Single Ever!,"Jessica Simpson Is SO Hot As The Dukes Of Hazzard`s Daisy Duke.I saw the movie during a beach vacation,and soon after when I returned home,I watched the music video on the internet.Now,believe me,the music video is just as good as the movie!In the music video Daisy(Jessica) is SO HOT! I coudn`t beleive it! You should either here this song or at least see the music video!WALK WITH YOUR BOOTS ON FOREVER,JESSICA!"
1,Please Read BEFORE You Buy!,"The book was poorly written. There was too much emphasis on tiny characteristics of the characters and not enough focus on Christianity. It is supposed to be a story about finding God, and if it is, then I missed that point. The characters have no depth and it is hard to get into, for the plot is too dumb. I don't like to use childish language, but I can find no other to describe my disappointment. There was no suspence to the plot, with a very predictable ending. Please, save your money, borrow it from the library."
3,Beware: no co-op split screen,"Please read the other reviewers' comments regarding how good this game is (or isn't). My only comment is that the description suggests that it has both online and split-screen co-op multiplayer. That is not correct. The game only supports online co-op, not split screen. Hope this helps you from making the same mistake that I did."
1,Severe issues that EA will not correct,"In order to play online you must accept EA's Terms and Conditions, but in order to see those you must first get online. This catch-22 is solvable only by purchasing another EA game (Army of Two is purported to work) and accepting the terms using that game. If you do not do this you must sign out of the PSN in order to play the game because otherwise it will freeze on the menu screen while trying to connect to EA's servers. Essentially multiplayer doesn't work unless you use another EA game to accept the terms, and single player doesn't work unless you do that or sign out before playing every time.If you don't care about multiplayer or the inconvenience of having to sign out of PSN in order to play, the game is still not very good. Dated graphics, poor writing, poor physics, and poor performance are immediately noticeable. Avoid this game like the plague."
2,gta for mercenaries,"the ruind the game I like action not to be runing up and down with a uglyest mercenary in the world, I were especting more action"
3,"A fun game, though could be better","I bought this game because it looked fun in the commercial with the ""Oh no you didn't"" song, and I have to say it is fun to play. I like how you can go all over the place, you can drive any vehicle in the game, and there are many weapons to choose from, and nearly anything can be destroyed.I would rate it higher, but the graphics aren't nearly as good as I was expecting, I mean they are still good looking graphics, but I think they can be improved upon. Also, a lot of the dialogue is repetitive. The storyline is okay, and somewhat confusing at times.Overall this is a fun game to play, and I would recommend it to others, but with the power of the PS3 I was expecting a little bit more."
3,Not bad,"I expected better, but its just a average game. I wouldnt rebuy it if I had the chance. Better to rent it than buy it."
1,Not fun to read anymore,"I have subscribed to Scientific American for many years and looked forward to each issue but that has changed. Awhile ago they changed their format and reading it now is as much fun as reading the fine print on your credit card account (altough it might be even finer). I'm a retired electrical engineer and like to keep up with science but reading the magazine is just plain hard. Not the subject matter, but the way it is presented. When you are trying to follow a complex thought it does not help that you are having a problem reading the microscopic font. I do not have this problem with any other publication I receive. Sorry that the magazine has come to this."
2,Not the same magazine.....,"Scientific American has really changed lately, so much so that I didn't renew my subscription. I then got a notice that they were turning it over to a debt collection agency, had to call and unsubscribe. Cute.If you are looking for research articles and neutral reporting, go elsewhere. Many issues were just a collection of short commentaries, ads, and editorializing. If you like light reading, and don't mind liberal views it might be great. The writers tend to bash religion and rightwingers, and as others have noted spend a lot of time on environmental issues esp. global warming. It got to be tiresome and I didn't want to pay for Steve Mirsky's lame-o humor. I'm giving Science News a shot, it looks pretty decent. Seed is also a possibility, but I liked the biweekly format of the former."
3,good science but often boring and annoyingly political,"I hate that this SCIENCE mag is often political and it's not really written for human interest, I prefer DISCOVER."
3,Things sure have changed at Sciantific American,"I have been a fan of this mag for over 20 years but as time goes forward they are seriously showing political bias and favoritism. I am no longer going to maintain a subscription and I have stopped buying these as gifts for family and friends. It is still superior to Popular Mechanics and many other ""tabloid science"" mags but now days I find better journalism online!"
4,Science at the edge of my limits to understand,"I subscribe to many science magazines and certainly this magazine is the one that give me the most hard science information. Occasionally there are even articles that just go tantalizingly beyond my ability to follow all the science and this is coming from somebody who has always loved science and has a science related degree and job. Discover, Pop Sci... they are my fun science magazines, THIS is the magazine that has provided the bulk of the real information that has been useful in my life and my job."
3,The End of Science?,"I whole heartedly agree with many of the previous posters in that Scientific American has slid from a paragon of scientific review, when I began reading it in the 1960's, to a mediocre populist science rag. I still read it, I am unsure of what is better, affordable and easily accessible to those without an academic affiliation. I do not possess and academic PhD. I am just a medical provider with additional training in Public Health, so I do not claim to be a scientist let alone a researcher. However, I want in depth articles on the latest thinking in quantum mechanics, cosmology, virology, etc., I long for the day when SciAm returns to the serious magazine it once was and leaves the fluff scientific articles to Popular Science and the like. If anyone can recommend a replacement magazine whose subscription is not hundreds of dollars a year, I am listening."
5,a class act,"This is a very moving collection of Debbys' Christian music as is the recent ""You Light Up My Life - Greatest Inspirational Songs"" - if you like this you'll like that too. Boone has a dramatic soaring voice that comforts the soul. Can't wait to get her latest on Concord Records ""Reflections of Rosemary"" a tribute to mother in law Rosemary Clooney. She may finally get the props she deserves."
2,Nice looking but is sturdy.,The tool is not sturdy i tried to blend pie dough and the wire keep on colapsing. It looked nice but too flimsy.
2,Indeed!,"Dude, you're completely right! Actually, I'm brazilian, so I know many of the guitars from Giannini. In fact, I have one, and I'm forced to agree with you.But, on the other hand, Gianinni's guitars are very popular here in Brazil. And I will be lying if I say that they're not appropriate for the beginner. Any intermediate student of classical guitar knows that guitars like these do not correspond their abilities. But, for the beginner, its not that bad.Anyway, buying gianinni guitar depends on how you're going to use it. Don't you agree with me, man?"
3,Dashmat,"The dash has warped and cracked in our old pointiac. I found this online and decided to purhcase. This dashmat is certainly cheaper than repalcing the entire dash! Although not that great looking, it fit the car well and has done what it is intended to do. I give it a rating of 3 due to the overall appearance, the fact it comes without directions, and doesn't include anything to attach it to the original dash."
2,Not the best design,"My Great Neck screw starter came with a slightly different handle which is black and red (rather than clear and red). The tip of this tool isn't very sharp, and so you really need an awl to make an indentation first or it won't ever grip. The really bad thing is the fact the screw threads are spaced like a machine screw instead of a wood screw. They are much too close together and so it doesn't really get a bite into the wood until you've twisted it for a long time. When you finally do get the thing into the wood, and then unscrew it, the hole will not match the threads of a wood screw. So is it really saving you time and effort? They used to provide screw starters in cheap little tool kits that you could buy for a couple of bucks. You can't find them anywhere anymore. They worked properly. This doesn't, but it might have to do with no alternatives. I've been looking for a decent one for years -- you can't find them anywhere."
3,Cookbook review,"This is a good book but not as helpful as I'd hoped it would be. But, of course, I'm new to Thai cooking."
2,pure poison perfume,"This perfume smells wonderful. What is a total bummer, especially since it is made by Dior, is that the perfume fades in a few hours. You need to reapply it. It does not last. I can buy $20 perfume that lasts all day. It must have a lot of alcohol in it and that is a rip off."
1,Wrong size delivered,I ordered size 6.5 but I received wrong size. The right side is ok like what I ordered. Left shoes is wrong. It is size 8My girl can't wear each side different sizeI don't know how you can deal with this problem.
5,Profoundly Sensual,"How wonderful you are, O Love,how much sweeterthan all other pleasures!But to try to quote from the Song is like hunting for a rabbit's foot. Or trying to cook only a spoonful of soup. The lovers are stoked with the such desperate passion, that no matter the circumstance, the politic, or the law, they bestow on themselves and, now, thanks to the translation, on us, a profound innocence. In that split moment before tears begin to well. Before pain is translated into reaction. Or desire hits the brain. No wonder the Song flaunts such a pure animal presence. The lovers living between the heartbeats. I can see the Shulamite stealthing around the city at night. Silent, almost rolling, footsteps. The lovers collision always in the softlight of dawn. The air cold.Hurry, my love! Run away,my gazelle, my wild stagon the hills of cinnamon."
3,"Decent translation, good commentary","This translation has some problems. It is a bit bland compared to the King James. The translators are known more for their work with Modern Hebrew poetry and their style doesn't really fit here. On the other hand, the commentary, while not without flaw, is consistently enlightening, as is the essay at the end by Robert Alter."
3,"A lyrical, funny Western...","In recent years, Robert Benton has exhibited a subtle capacity to manipulate audience emotions through an astute use of fashionable themes... In his more inventive films, however his ear for witty, naturalistic dialog and his expert handling of actors is allied with a perceptive, probing and quizzical attitude towards genre...Benton's most impressive work was his own directorial debut, ""Bad Company"" a lyrical, funny Western about a group of young Civil War draft-dodgers seeking fame and fortune in the West as con-men outlaws...Clearly intended to strike an emotional chord in an America at war with Vietnam, the movie's strength lies in Benton's gently, anti-romantic undermining of traditional pioneer myths: en route to a final encounter with death, the boys find themselves reduced to robbing infants of small change, while the 'heroes' they meet on the empty, dusty prairies are incompetent, braggart bullies..."
4,"An artful, reflective, unusual western","One of the best anti-heroic westerns I've seen... A young, brash Jeff Bridges stars as Jake Rumsey, the putative leader of a disorganized ""gang"" of adolescent boys, set adrift amid the lawlessness of the Civil War-era West. The boys teeter between adulthood and adolescence, abject fear and murderous amorality, and as they wander through the bleak, vacant prairie, they have no signposts -- figurative or literal -- to guide them. Although the subject matter is pretty raw, the film is surprisingly circumspect (visually, at least), and the violence and pain it portrays is all given a complete context, and full emotional depth. It's a surprising film, with a deceptively simple structure weighed against a deeply pessimistic view of human nature. It's also one of those superior westerns that feels absolutely, completely convincing. Recommended."
4,Solid throughout,"From start to finish a solid effort from Circle II Circle. This is on par with Watching in Silence, maybe a little better, and definitely better than Middle of Nowhere. Highlights are Who Am I To Be, Heal You, and Your Reality. Buy it, and hope they start touring the U.S soon."
3,great cd and great family unity-fantastic,this is one cd i would certainly recomend to everyone.songs and music are a joy to listen and you can tell this family really love the Lord.Praise God.they also have a second cd which is even better. wow. May Hashem bless your family and your music ministry to greater heights.
2,Readable,"Don't confuse this with a really great book by the same name by Jeff Shaara. This book was all right, nothing to get too excited about. I'm glad I got it from a used book store. I could less about M.A.M.s politics(assuming you read the dedication.) I'm not sure why some of these authors think I care how they feel about the war. I guess it is just their way to vent. Dave Sterns two books on Enterprise, 'Daedalus' and 'Daedalus's Children' were excellent."
4,Great book,"A classical. It's not only about Iceland, it's about all of us. Great book. Enormous but you get hooked to it."
4,It works,"For me anyways, the claims made by this product are true. I am doing less stress eating, and have less cravings, particularly for sweets. I am definitely sleeping better. Does the scale show fantastic results? NO. Weight loss is nominal right now, not even average, but I am on my way down the scale, instead up up. I was sick and tired of cravings running my life. Now they aren't as bad, and the weight loss is a secondary benefit."
4,An amazing story of triumph over tragedy...,"Dorothy's story is sad and horrific in parts. The abuse that she suffered at the hands of family members. The language is shocking and at times vulgar but based on the facts of Dorothy's extremely hard life. She is a true heroine to have overcome such insurmountable odds. The story flows and in spite of limited education, Dorothy shares the details of her life in a humble and confident way. A truly fascinating biography that you won't be able to put down."
1,A hookless wonder,"OK. I like this band - I like them a lot. But this CD just isn't very good. The first song ""Maybe"" hints at past glories, but the rest of the album fails to sustain even that modest level of melodic interest. This is a first for the Connells - and album virtually devoid of hooks and memorable melodies.Begin your Connells introduction elsewhere."
1,Not the complete work from Thomas!!!,"After having borrowed a 1946 publication of Genesis: A Devotional Commentary by W.H. Griffith Thomas, I was so impressed with the insight I searched Amazon for the reprint. I thought I had found it in this Genesis: A Devotional Commentary. I was wrong. This book, although not specified, is only 1 of 3 volumes! It does not state that anywhere in the details. I am returning this selection and buying a complete used copy for $6. Thomas is amazing, this version of the book is not.In case you could not find the Kregel (used) publication:http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0825438179/sr=1-2/qid=1297705175/ref=olp_product_details?ie=UTF8&me;=&qid;=1297705175&sr;=1-2&seller;="
4,Probably the best of the recording magazines out there,"This is probably the best of the magazines dealing with recording out there. It gives a lot of good information,not just product ads like some of the other magazines. It's definitely worth the money for the amount of knowledge you gain from the articles."
1,have not yet received item. still waiting.,have yet to receive magazine. cannot give an adequate review at this time. going on 5 weeks.
5,Super funny,"I am in love with this book. It is super funny and a nice twist on the traditional tale. My son (2.5) doesn't get how funny it is yet, but he will."
4,Well made jeans,Jeans arrived in a timely manner. Jeans were in great condition on arrival and fit quite well. Denim was better quality than other jeans I've seen. Liked the extra belt loops.
1,misleading,"The title says traditional fit, but when I tried the jeans, the have bell bottom legs. I wanted the normal cut around the ankle, not bell bottoms."
2,Zipper won't zip,The zipper on the jeans I received was defective and would not zip up or down. They also seemed to fit smaller than the size they were labeled to be. I had to return them.
2,Not worth the price.,"I bought this straightener at Target for 75 dollars because my CHI broke after a year and I didn't want to spend another 140 dollars on buying a new one. I thought for the money and the brand name that this straightener would be quality, but I returned it after using it a couple times. I only have wavy hair, and it didn't straighten any better than the 25 dollar Conair straightener I used in high school. It doesn't get anywhere near the 400 degrees it advertizes, and it smells funny. I returned it and bought a GVP (CHI knockoff) from Sally Beauty for the same price and am much happier."
3,Not that Great,"This flat iron does straighten, but does not give that silky shiny feeling I get from other flat irons. Also pulls on the hair a bit. Not worth the price."
3,Awesome sound,"This was a bargain at $99 from an electronics store that gives best buys. I bought it in 2003 and the bass was incredible with my home theater, it really added to the movie experience and it pumped up bass in music too.After just 4 years, it seemed to have simply stopped working for some reason. It still turned on and made some kind of hum when the cable from the receiver was plugged into it, so it did not blow a fuse or burn out completely, but there was no longer any sound coming from it no matter what I did. I replaced it with a different brand, but then found out when fiddling with the controls of my AV tuner that somehow the subwoofer sound (that was controlled by the onscreen menu, not any visible knob on the tuner) was turned down/off. Once I changed the setting, the subwoofer worked fine again. Now I just use it on my extra receiver in another room for another system."
1,Flag was Upside Down,"I bought this for my college dorm, not looking for anything fancy. Well, lo and behold, I purchased it, and it was upside down. The grommets are on the wrong side of the flag, so I can't hang it up correctly."
4,Very rich and informative,"This book offers the reader an extremely indepth look at the Kabbalah system. It covers the a wide range of topics: En-Sof, Death, the Ten Sefiroth, the Soul. More than most books I've come across. It is also chocked full of illustrations. It's only fault is not delving deeper into the tree of life. That would have made it 5 stars."
1,Very Disappointing,"Even for $6.88 at Sam's Club, this Millennium Collection CD was no bargain. It's so bad I couldn't even finish listening to it! Where did they get these cuts? They sound so muddy and poorly mixed that they must have been practice session tapes retrieved from the dumpster. The various instruments and voices keep fading in & out so you can't follow the music. Plus, the tempos and overall sounds are very different from the ""definitive"" versions most of us think of. I never thought it was possible to mess up a Clapton song, but UMI proved me wrong. And the liner notes? --None in this cardboard packaged ""green"" version."
1,"Bad, very bad Tassimo customer service for Tassimo recall","Tassimo brewer part recall - Federally mandated.It has been more than 2 months and I am still waiting for my replacement part!What am I supposed to do? I'm thinking of purchasing a different single cup machine.Especially since Tassimo has discontinued so many brands of coffee.Absolutely no customer service at Tassimo! A bunch of nothings must work there.They are owned by Kraft Foods, right? Think I had better sell my Kraft stock."
2,Where are the the coffee discs?,"Prior to ordering the product, I read the first review,which said no free coffee or tea discs were included in the box. And he/she had to go through a nightmare to resolve the situation. Am not sure if it was resolved.I,too, got the machine in just two days. Wow. Impressed. But where was the coffee? Uh huh. Not to be found. I'm not sure what hell I'll have to go through to get it. We'll see.So beware. Be warned. Be prepared."
4,Love my Tassimo,"I love the Tassimo machine which I got in December for my birthday. I love the cappuccino and latte by Gevalia, while the coffees leave a lot to be desired. The hot chocolate by Suchard is horrible though. I'm not a tea person, but my mom drinks the Earl Grey from the Tassimo and she said it's very good. The machine is easy to clean up and very easy to use. I would recommend it, though the refill t-discs are a bit costly if you use it on a daily basis."
1,great machine coffee sucks,"Great machine but any of the coffee pods make brown water, not coffee. I haven't had a good cup of coffe since I got the machine and went back to my old Calaphon Coffee maker. The idea of single serve is great. Hopefully someday the coffee pods will improve. But, if you like the taste of brown water; enjoy"
3,Got 3 years out of it...,"I purchached one of the original Tassimo models in 2006 - it's been good, but not great. I never seem to have a cup that is hot enough, and quite honestly - not being able to fit a cup larger than 8 oz. is annoying. Final straw: the ""reader"" is not shot, so it does not work automatically. This is the devise that flashes and reads the bar code of the pod - and it's the downfall of the system. Once that goes it does not pay to fix."
5,Braun Coffee Machine,"Great little machine. Takes up minimal space. Quick and easy to use. Makes wonderful coffees, teas and hot chocolate!!!"
5,The Tassimo made me a coffee lover!,"I have never liked drip coffee. Between the bland taste and the mess created to make it, I have always avoided dealing with the coffee maker.Now that we have the Tassimo, making coffee, lattes, cappucino, hot chocolate, tea and more are so easy!! No mess and quick to serve, even for a group.I would recommend cleaning under the t-disc holder, especially after using any of the milk products. A small amount of fluid does build up there after every cup and can cause residue to drop into your cup the next time you use it. It's super fast and easy for clean-up.We have a Nespresso machine at work which I also like, but for the low cost of the Tassimo and the variety of beverages you can make, I think this is a great value! We use the 20% off coupon from Bed, Bath & Beyond to buy more t-discs at a discount."
3,disappointed,"I purchased the Tassimo Hot Beverage maker and was disappointed to find that the temperature of each cup was just 'luke' warm...and I had to zap it in the microwave to get it hotter. I have tried the cappuccino T-Disc by Gevalla, and it was delicious...but only came out to be less than 8oz....and I have tried the latte T-Disc by Gevalla and it too, was less than 8ounces...I had purchased 11 ounce glass mugs (because that is what is recommended on Tassimo's printed information...and it looks stupid to serve this only HALF full. So, I can't use the 11 oz cups...but I still have to zap the finished coffee in the microwave....bummer...TJ"
4,OUTSTANDING,"We are absolutely happy with this machine. It is LOW maintenance- easy to clean, practically nothing to clean. Just dump the high pressure overflow cup and rinse the nozzle and go! A little slow on heating up as I understand compared to the new one. My wife picked this one over the new one because the 1400 she says makes better foamm but a little louder. If I could find another one of these at this price I'd buy it for the office!I only gave it 4 stars becauseof the slow heating."
1,terrible cust service from Tassimo,Recently purchased the T-65 directly from Tassimo.BIG mistake.It is defective and the replacement from Bosch takes 4 to 6 weeks. I was originally told 2 weeks for a replacement.Have called customer service four time since giving it as a Christmas gift and am told there is nothing they can do and I'll have to wait 2 more weeks for receipt of the replacement.Should have purchased from Amazon.Tassimo gives terrible service!
1,Poor quality,I bought this thinking I would get a great quality cup of coffee...but I was dead wrong. This pricy machine was one of the worst I tested - and the clean up is terrible. I saw an ad for this thought it was worth a try...not worth the $170.I saw another system in Good Housekeeping in December that I purchased and now love...
4,Over priced but the best on the market,1/08 UPDATE you can now buy the coffee t-disks at Target... The coffee maker price has NOT dropped but I am weak and now have one at work and at home.
5,A Must Have for Coffee Lovers!,"I received this as a gift last Christmas and absolutely love it! The Decaf Latte's are my favorite and the Hot Chocolate is an excellent treat with the kids! As I have people over quite a bit, it has come in very handy when everyone wants something different. I can now make a regular coffee, a decaf coffee, a latte and a hot chocolate with no fuss! It is a great value and very delicious!"
1,Just wait until it breaks!,"The customer service for this product is THE worst! This is the second review I have written for this product (my first one didn't make it up here for some reason). Anyway, the machine starting spraying water from the top and wouldn't quit until I unplugged it (this was just 2 months after I received it for Christmas). Now, when I plug it in, nothing happens. It is dead and broken. Customer Service says to send it in, of course, I have to pay for the shipping to send it in to get fixed. Closest service center is in San Francisco??? Not worth the money."
2,Get your rag ready. The Tassimo is a mess and its average Maxwell House quality coffee,"When I purchased my Tassimo from Best Buy, I thought I was getting a premium machine that made authentic cappuccino. Instead, I have to clean the machine after each milk brew with a clear disc and just found out the coffee is made by Maxwell House- the king of average coffee. Definately not worth 169 dollars. Even Martha Stewart Live had an issue making a cup with a Tassimo- it didn't work 2x on live TV.I had a Keurig before the Tassimo and was fed up with making hot chocolate without a k-cup. The range in Keurig is just coffee and tea and definately not worth going back to.I guess I am going back to my French Press"
4,Tassimo works for me!,"My husband and I have enjoyed our Tassimo Beverage System so much that I recently ordered another Tassimo Beverage System for our second home. It makes a great cup of coffee or tea. However, we only drink about one cup apiece each morning. It could be expensive if you drink lots of coffee. I would like to see the company offer more variety in flavored coffee."
3,counseling,This was a text that was necessary to complete a counseling course I was taking. It was interesting and helpful.
1,Waste Of Time !!!,"Don't Waste Your Time With This Recycled Garbage !!! It IS 2Pac's Music... But It's 2Pac's Music Destroyed !!! It Sounds Like 1 of Those Myspace Idiots Trying 2 Get Famous By Claiming They Knew Pac !!! They Rap On 1 Of His Tracks... Change The Beat, And ACT LIKE THEY DID SOMETHING SPECIAL !!! NOBODY CAN HANG WITH PAC !!! PERIOD !!! All This Is A Blow 2 The Question of ""Who's The Best Rapper?"" I'm Just Glad That Question Isn't Decided By This Coffee Table Coaster !!! Anybody Thats Heard The O.G. Copy's Will Understand !!! Stop Molding Pac Into A Wack Rapper, With A Grill, Keepin It Crunk, Kickin' It With A BUNCH OF BUSTA'S !!!!!!!!"
2,Why?,"Why? Why? I have heard all of these songs already. I own the orgianals with out these other klownz on em'. Not to take away from any of these other rappers because most of them I listen to... But, WHY? WHY? are they on this album. If I want to here T.I. I will go buy his album. I dont want to hear him rap with Pac! WHY?"
3,Pac's Life,Why oh Why does his work have to be altered to include people he never met yet his true friends are removed.
2,Daggone Shame!!!,"That Ms Afeni Shakur would allow folks to pretend to know what a PAC album would sound like if he was still living. His vocals alone should be able to sell any posthumous release without watering it down.Listening to this version of PAC's Life was sickening. I have the orignal bootleg version of it using Prince's ""Pop Life"" and it was rugged and raw just like it was.It's almost becoming more detrimental to PAC's legacy to keep letting other artist collaborate on these tracks instead of just using the regular unreleased versions with PAC solely on it on w/him and the Outlawz the way it was intended to be.I just hope Ms Shakur and the rest of the Amaru staff would just realize that when it's not broke, stop looking for a crack. All this does is just make me pull out the old Makavelli boots and reminisce just how vicious PAC was as an artist and as a young black male.RIPYour ""Soldier Story"" will live on."
1,This is getting ridiculous.,STOP putting artists that 2pac would have probablynever worked with on his songs! I don't understand why people think these dumb beats and radio rap artists are gonna do justice to a pac album. Haha this cd is SO bad! Afeni needs to let a legit producer create tracks like those on Better Dayz. These people producing his stuff now never even met him and don't know his style. Might as well let Biz Markie on the albums. Whatever I'm over it. RIP Pac sorry they're putting this gay stuff out with your name on it it's too bad. I'm surprised Akon isn't on here. Ashanti....WOW....have DRE or QUICK or someone like that produce...no one else.
1,Fabrication of a legend.,"""What the industry did to 'PAC, they did to Jesus, raping his vocals and destroying a message""- Immortal Technique"
1,From a 12 year old girl,I was very disapointed with this book. The characters had little personality and very little humour. It was hard to imagine the characters were like the people in the sitcom.I think this book is poor literature that will only appeal to people who like the sitcom.
4,Great Fix,This was just what I needed as the button that held the belt buckle was broken off and had to fish it off the floor all the time.
5,Object Oriented Visual Basic,"If you are already accustomed to using some sort of object oriented methodology then GUIDS may seem like a waste of time. The second half of the book is more than worth the price though. Being well improved over the first book, the OO examples used, although not thorough, are well thought through and can be built on quickly once your thought process gets jump-started by some coding. Thanks for the chapter on DAO"
2,History for Professors,"This book is very in depth. You need to be a professor to absorb the information given in it.Not many diagrams explaining the places on the body its talking about. If your a doctor,its a great book. If an average Joe, hard to understand.kevin"
5,Great storage item,We have purchased 4 of these to use the empty space in our garage to the fullest. They are fairly easy to install and hold alot of items and weight. Great item.
5,Great Storage!,"Love these, love these, love these! We bought two, will probably buy two more! These were easy enough for my husband to set up by himself in the garage and they hold a ton of stuff. It's so nice to have stuff off of the floor so we have room for vehicles in the garage. They have adjustable height, so you can decide how high or low you want them to be."
5,Storage system,"My husband ordered about 6 of these because he loves them so much! They work great to get everything up off your garage floor. They are VERY sturdy. They hold A LOT of stuff! These took a little while longer to ship, maybe because they are heavy. But definitely worth the wait! Our garage looks so neat and clean now! Now we can buy more stuff!"
3,Useful but limited by attachment,"This is a useful rack, sturdy and easy to assemble with enough space to store quite a bit of content. However, the weight that can be stored is very limited by the attachment to the ceiling. If you can screw this rack into ceiling studs or a solid concrete surface, you can pack some heavy weight on it. If your garage (or wherever you mount it) has a dry wall ceiling, however, you will not be able to use this rack for anything but empty boxes, foam or other light-weight stuff. Keep that in mind when you select this for a specific purpose. Also consider the height of the rack itself, particularly in a low-ceiling garage, where it can easily get in the way."
2,Poor quality,"I found my shipment of four storage systems left by the garage (not by the front door as usual) and the UPS person didn't bother let me know (as usual). Upon examining the merchandise, I found out why. Two of the four containers had ripped open and three of the four contained parts that were covered with rust.The ones I had bought at Home Depot were not like this at all."
3,HyLoft 45-by-45 Inch Overhead Storage System #00540,Still haven't installed this item so I cannot make a legitimate rating.
3,Good Concept,"Purchased six of these storage systems. Easy to assemble. Only problem was poor quality lag bolts. Even with proper pre-drilling, soaping bolts & hand tightening without over torquing the heads would pop off. Spent an additional $48 for better lag bolts!"
3,Bad lag bolts,"This ceiling-suspended storage system was recommended by several friends. It was relatively easy to install, but it's smaller and offers less space for storage than I expected. Don't be fooled by the picture that shows multiple containers neatly stowed (they must be small containers); look at the measurements. My main complaint relates to the horrible quality of the lag bolts included in the hardware. These are the bolts used to suspend the apparatus to the studs in your ceiling. Using normal torque to tighten the bolts, four of them fell out of the stud, having snapped off without me realizing it. I replaced all of the lag bolts with ones I bought at Home Depot, and they did fine. I bought two of these, and had this problem with both sets."
5,Best purchase made for storage!,"Bought mine back in 2003 when we moved into our new house. Of course, there's NO place to store anything in the house, so had to find some way to make room. Noticed lots of room in the garage, especially over garage door (11 ft ceilings). Bought 1 of the 4'x4'. Fits with no touching, or any other problems (well, except finding studs to mount to the ceiling)! Bought 2 more and now I have to room I needed for boxes and decorations and baby stuff and whatever else I need to put away! Simple, easy to install by yourself, and relatively cheap now (I paid $79.95 for mine, looks like they lowered the price by $20)!"
4,Good product,"They are a bit tricky to install, but any handy person should be able to do it. I use mine in the attic and used two together. Working great and no complaints."
5,Easy to set up and worth the $.,"Based on other reviews, decided to buy. Easy set up. Works as designed. Perfect spot above my garage door. Have 2 - getting a third."
5,HyLoft Storage System,Excellent product. Better than I expected. So easy to install even a woman can install it. :) (I did.) Quick delivery. Completely satisfied.
3,Don't Overtighten the Stud Screw .... !!!,"Install 3 of this, found out the next day that couple of stud screw broken and loose (barely screw to the stud, i can even loose the screw with my finger). It sounds a big metal **DANG** when it happened.I guess, i tighten it little bit too much. but the screw to the stud seems weak.Need to go to hardware store to find the replacement tomorrow."
1,Short one of pretty much every nut/bolt screw (Even counting the provided 'extras' package),Bit hard to install due to a shortage of parts. Got it installed in the end.
4,Good Renaissance Romance,"I have found it difficult to find good romances that take place during this time period, but this one engaged me and kept me interested. While not the best I ever read, it is worth a read by anyone interested in Renaissance-era romance.While it starts a little slow with all the talk of monks and the abbey, it picks up as soon as the pair meet. The obstacle to their love - the fundamental nature of the two people - was an excellent one, because it was realistic and believable, as opposed to being kept apart by some ridiculous misunderstanding or such that is often the case with romance novels.I have never read a book by this author before, but I am going to look for more by her."
4,An amazing true story with awesome vintage photos,"What an amazing true tale of a 1914 expedition trip to reach the South Pole that did not work out. After the destruction of their ship, The Endurance, in the ice Shackleton spent nearly 2 years traveling on the ice, open sea and inhospitable island terrains to return to civilization. Utterly amazing that all of the original crew members survived the experience.The book is filled with fascinating original photos taken during the ordeal. Amazing to just sit and browse through the pictures. The reading fills in the blanks. Impressive."
2,hard to keep reading,"It is tough to get through this book. Only the first half is about Shakleton's expedition. The rest amounts to a log of the Aurora crew that Shakleton relays second-hand.The Endurance expedition, itself, is quite a piece of history, but the book does a poor job of showing this. The writing is dry. Killing dogs, penguins and seals is a regular thing. Location and weather are reported on almost every page. He does give a good sense of the cold, however and the food supplies."
5,Some Kind of Breathtaking...,"I first saw this movie on TV as a college student. I loved it so much that an old boyfriend went out and bought it for me on VHS tape. I have watched this movie so many times I'm surprised the VHS tape is still working!The actors are perfectly cast in the leads. They are so believeable in their portrayals that I could have gone to high school with them. The kissing scene is HOT. Clothes don't need to come off for you to feel the hot wind of chemistry and passion that blows off that first kiss scene.The characters are not glossy, and that is what I love about John Hughes. He portrays coming-of-age in all its naked and truest glory, not the perfect airbrushed schlock that has come out in later years.If you're looking to see character development and great plot set to a great soundtrack, this is your type of movie."
1,"Unless it comes directly from Amazon, it's made in Mexico","Very disappointed. I placed 3 separate orders and 4 of the dvds, including this one, were made from Mexico. It clearly shows on Amazon site one cover with English only text, but the DVD you get is stamped 'Made in Mexico', a different cover, and the Title & narrative are written in English and Spanish. So if the price is 'too good to be true' and does not come directly from Amazon, this is probably what you will get. Yes, you can return it, and yes, it is a big hassle. Hope this saves some people the trouble I went through..."
4,Wonderful 80's,"This movies is another classic 80's masterpiece. If you love the clothes, hair, and music from the 80's this is your movie. A poor ""Tomboy"" is in-love with her best friend (boy), but he doesn't see her...only the most popular girl in school. Like all 80's movies it has the typical classic ending. You'll love this movie as much as you loved the 80's."
3,Not Her Best Work...,"After having read and taught the book, ""Women of Sand and Myrrh,"" I expected more from this collection of short stories. While there are a couple of really shining gems in this collection -- notably the story ""A Season of Madness"" -- there are many stories which are patly superfluous, and contain very little in the way of plot or character development. Hanan al-Shaykh has the potential to write heart-rending, unforgettable stories -- but this volume is not the best representation of her abilities."
2,Beginning of the end for the Gold Belt,"This show is pretty much sums up why the NWA never caught up to the WWF. It was supposed to be the show where Lex Luger defeated Ric Flair to win the NWA Title and take the promotion into the New Era. However, Flair pulled a backstage power play, and not only got the win, but also got Dusty Rhodes fired, and Luger de-pushed. The rest of the card is superfluous really, although the Road Warriors and Windham matches are pretty good. But the whole show is overshadowed by Flair's rampant egomania, and the disaster that it went on to cause."
3,Wish it where live,This CD does not do this band justice. I enjoy the cd having seen the band many times live. I fear that those who have not heard this band live will not find this CD as enjoyable as I do. I rate this cd a 4 but for those who have not been fortunate enough to see this band in its element I feel the best I can rate it as a 3.
4,Rent this one! Well done suspense/horror,"Definitely a film for Twilight Zone fans (stuck in a nightmare that won't end)--this one spooked my wife and son, so it qualifies on that level! The acting is good, the suspense is constant, and the ending cleverly ties up many of the questions posed during the family's search for answers. You gotta love Ray Wise!"
5,GREAT HORROR FOR THE HOLIDAYS!!!,"LIONS GATE STUDIOS BRINGS ANOTHER GREAT SMART ART HOUSE HORROR MOVIE TO DVD! THIS IS A VERY SCARY MOVIE WITH A COUPLE OF GOOD LAUGHS THROWN IN AS WELL. THIS IS A VERY DARK MOVIE ABOUT A FAMILY THAT TAKES A WRONG TURN IN THE WOODS, BUT THEN THINGS GO HORRIBLY WRONG! THERE IS A GREAT TWISTED ENDING, AND THE ACTING IS VERY WELL DONE. THIS IS ANOTHER GREAT MOVIE THAT FANGORIA MAGAZINE, THE NUMBER HORROR MAG! GAVE IT'S FANGO SEAL OF APPROVAL TO, AND IT WAS VERY WELL DESERVED! FOR ALL YOU CHEAP SCARE FANS, STAY AWAY! THERE ARE GREAT CRAPPY TURDS THAT ARE FOR YOU! LIKE THE STEPTURD WIVES RE-MAKE, TURD OF THE DEAD RE-MAKE, YES I MEAN THE DAWN OF THE DEAD RE-MAKE! AND TURD-HELSING! THIS IS A GREAT HORROR MOVIE! DON'T MAKE A WRONG TURN BY PASSING UP THIS MOVIE, BUY IT TODAY!"
5,Great Teaching Tool for Young Riders,Making anatomy interesting for middle and high school kids is a tough task at best. This book takes advantage of the natural love of horses to teach them more about horses in a very scientific way. And it's fun. A nice tool to use on days when the weather makes riding impossible.
5,horse anatomy,This is not just a child's coloring book! It is a very in-depth anatomy book suitable for adults as well children of all ages. Our youth club is using it as a study guide for a hippology exam at the Pinto and Paint World Shows. Highly recommend!
2,This book is a very good book for beginner!,I don't really like this book after reading and using it because there were confusing topics in the book.
2,Not the bag I was hoping for,"I have used this bag a handful of times -- perhaps 10-15 -- and I am thoroughly disappointed. With just a computer, power adapter, and 1 book this bag is unmanageably heavy. Lugging it 10 minutes across campus leaves my shoulder and upper back sore (and I am NOT a weakling -- I lug around a 33 pound toddler all the time!). It is not roomy, and not very conducive to conveniently carrying components -- even a power cord. The water bottle pockets on the side are nearly useless because of the way they're designed.And worst of all, having only used this bag for a little while, the top handle is ripping off! The construction quality clearly leave a lot to be desired. I would return it if I could, and find another, more quality, better designed computer bag."
1,Is this a joke?,"To be honest, I'm VERY disgusted with this book - I just purchased it this afternoon, started to read it and went to the web site that was supposed to contain plugins and other materials from the book, only to find that it is essentially an EMPTY site! The site is located at:[...]There is no reason that this book has been out for such a long period time and yet there is still no real support site! On top of that, one of the authors even touts that this bogus site is ""coming soon."" That's right, Jay Allen announces on his own blog that:""Hacking Movable Type (which has a 'coming-soon' companion website, hackingmt.com) is finally out and it's even more fantastic than I remember.""That post is located at:[...]He made that post on August 18, 2005 and it's now the middle of April 2006. Frankly, I'm disgusted and can not recommend this book if the authors and publisher (Wiley) are so dishonest."
5,wonderful,This is a must-have if you're a real Jarreau fan. Wonderful music. The slew of Grammys didn't come until a year or two later when Al came out with Breaking Away but This Time might have been even better. You will be uplifted by this CD. Get it.
5,His best!,"Every song is amazing; expertly produced, written and performed. High Crime was also very good, but this one is tops. The song ""Spain"" is a masterpiece!"
5,Simply Excellent,"I bought this book a month ago, more or less, and when I received it, I found the best backgroung history of 40K books I've ever read.Just buy it."
4,"Good machine, great bang for the bucks.",I had an InSinkErator prior to this one. The last one was more powerful and reversed. This works almost as well for a lot less money. If this had the reverse function I'd give it five stars....I was tempted to do that anyway.
3,Not sure.,I purchased this particular garbage disposal at the recommendation of the plumber who is working on my kitchen remodel. It hasn't been installed yet so I can't really say anything about it's performance. The product arrived in a timely manner from the seller though.
5,Amazing!,"This garbage disposal is amazing. When you turn it on, you don't hear anything. Honestly, I wish I would have purchased this disposal the first time around so I could have avoided replacing it."
4,"It works, but not as quiet as I thought it would be","I just finished the install of this, took me about 2 hours. I was replacing a badger5, about 10 years old, and was pretty noisy. I had high hopes that this would be super silent, and my biggest disappointment is it's still pretty noisy.The install instructions were pretty good. The power cord thing is really annoying, make sure you deal with this before you install (make sure you have it!) and buy some plumbers putty.I am not a plumber, and it was a little nerve wracking to install, the wife is still questioning whether there are any leaks, but it seems ok.Overall, it looks nice, works fine, but I was unimpressed with how much less quiet it was than the Badger 5."
5,Super quiet and smooth!,"I replaced an older model whose plastic housing broke over 4 years of wear and tear. This model is much better constructed, and easy to work on. It is also really quiet and doesn't shake the whole kitchen while it is in use!"
2,Captain America,"I was very disappointed in the Captain America serial. This was not the Captain America of the comics. It was presented as a""classic"". NO WAY!"
1,You have got to be kidding Me,"After seeing Suze on PBS I decided to go out and get this book. About 40 pages into the work I came to the conclusion that this tome is more about marketing and salemanship than investing. There are a lot of naive people though that might buy this book thinking that it will help them, but nothing could be further from the truth. The picture on the front cover is ""clownish"", the advice is sometimes just as funny and the only person laughing all the way to the bank is Suze."
2,Simply Too Simplistic,"I agree with the reviewer who recommended Robert Koppel's much better Money Talks:Candid Conversations About Wealth In America.Koppel provides a discussion of money that is thoughtful,interesting,well analyzed and real."
2,"Codified Common Sense, For The Most Part","Practically anyone could have written this book - which is not to say it's entirely worthless, just not surprising or original. This is an exercise in the marketing of common-place ideas, but at least the ideas are sensible. The book is not actively harmful."
4,A Motivational Financial Book,"This book is a wonderful motivator to get you to realize the importance of getting your finances & your life in order. It was easy to read, and concise. This book is for the average person, who needs a little help getting their priorties straight. I really enjoyed it. I've already implemented much of the advice."
2,Common sense,"This book was filled with ideas and suggestions that are common sense for the average person. A great read for someone who is very financially undisciplined but for myself I already am financially stable...forgive me if I'm wrong but isn't the title ""The courage to be Rich""? This book was written under the assumption that its readers are complete idiots and have no money management skills!A better title for this book would be ""Idiots guide to personal finances""!"
1,The Courage To Be Rich,I found this book very annoying. I wanted a financial help book and got a religious discussion of everything. I do wish that business and religion could be kept separate. If I wanted religion I would look for a religious book. She would be more helpful if she kept to the financial facts and let the reader deal with their own spirituality. I am sorry I wasted money on it.
3,This is probably a good book for the emotional reader.,"When reading on finances, I pretty much prefer to the point information. This book seems to relate everything to some psychological scarring of your past. Although some excellent points where made, I found myself skipping through the pages freqently. The Ten Steps to Finacial Freedom was more to my liking."
3,A little surprised,"The thing I liked about this book was it left you still wondering who Melody's father is. Maybe some of you already figured it out but I haven't. In my opinion that's different than what the other series have done. I did get a bad taste in my mouth from the beginning though. It reads:'Cary was happier knowing we weren't as closely blood related as we both originally thought.' ...as though now a true relationship was not forbidden...'WHAT! Whatever. So it's OK to have a romantic relationship with your 2nd, 3rd cousin. Please. This book could've done without that line. Yet I know that that's the way VC Andews books tend to run.I was a little surprised at myself. By the end of the 2nd book in a series I usually end up disgusted with the main character. So far I find her tolerable (despite her and Cary's relationship).I'm glad the book didn't reveal who her father was. It kept my interest into reading into this series quicker."
1,Spirited,"I have read other books in this series, and realize that they are written by different people, but I was really disappointed with this book. I felt that the plot was a little hard to follow, and the characters didn't have any traits that made you attatched-or pulled you in."
1,"Porportions are not accurate, does not fit.","I ordered a black Dashmat for my 1992 Cadillac Seville. It arrive timely enought, but went downhill from there. It does not accurately fit into the space of the dashboard top, and overhangs the dash about 2 inches. It is too wide and does not line-up with the defrost vent. Poor quality obviously not made for my exact model of Cadillac, 1992 Seville, the model just prior to the Northstar change. I'm so disgusted that I don't even feel like wasting the time to send it back. Thanks for the wasted time and money. Tom Wolf, (760)270-4515."
3,"""Not For Use With Water-Related Products""???","There is a sticker on this thing that says ""Not for use with aquariums or other water-related products."" What the heck does THAT mean? I bought this to use on a modern washing machine -- the kind loaded with electronics and a motherboard. Is a washing machine a ""water-related product""? How about a coffee maker? If it gets damaged are they going to say the guarantee is invalid because of those weasel words?"
3,like,"By daughter was excited to get this movie but have not had the time to watch it yet...also the cd case came broken and the cd was loose in the box. I am a little worried that it might be scatched, but the price was very affordable to we won't be too disappointed I hope."
5,shadowy sounds from shadowy men,"Bought this cd as a present for an old friend, a keen guitarist,who loves it. Don't understand why their music isn't more widely known."
4,"not great, but ok. price is rightT","The pump works fine,but the one I got won't adjust the flow. The adjustment mechanism is easy to operate and get to, but on mine it just doesn't effect the flow. But the price is right and I'm satisfied."
1,Stopped working in about 2 months use.,"Ordered 2 pumps and the first one stopped working after about 2 months use. How do I handle the warranty to get a replacement pump?Thanks,"
1,disappointed,it's good price but it's not usable. Why? it's way too noisy. 2 types of noise: somehow gets air in the system so bubble noise. I found a way to eliminate that so I could live with that if the motor noise was not so annoying. You cannot hear water trickling from the humm of the motor. Very disappointed indeed.
5,perfect pump,"This pump works our entry fountain that completes our atrium. It has enough power for our fountain, but not so much that it is squirting water all over the place. This pump was so cheap that I got several incase we would need a replacement. We run our fountain quite a bit and the pump is still going strong. Pump was delivered in a timely manner too! Very happy with my purchase."
1,"Bragging, Beating Around the Bush, No Substance","If you can read and think, you will realize that the author just brags (indirectlt, rather in a smart way), beats around the bush and just provide some useless info on opening of the chakras which he makes it seem soooooo easy (which of course it isn't). If opening the chakras were that easy, there would be training centers all over USA that offer it as a short course (""Opening Your Chakras in Seven Days"", say as an example).Don't waste your time and money on this one."
1,Disappointing!,"After taking this product for 3 weeks, there was no change in my hotflashes. I do know it can take some time to get into your system, however not this long. I read numerous reviews prior to ordering the product which were good. Sadly, I see no change!"
3,Excellent price and service!,"I honestly don't know that this product is that effective. However, if you choose to try it amazon.com is the place!"
4,very powerful,"Powerful enough to make me stop taking them. I took these pills as a way to rid my body of excess estrogen stored. I was on my period when I started and took them for 5 days. my period lasted 4 and then it stopped but my chest tenderness that usually comes and goes with the ending of the mensrual cycle, never left and i wond up getting a second period a week later thus i became irregular and had no idea what was happening. So I stopped taking the dim and the bleeding stopped a few days after having returned for 6 days. Be careful"
2,DIM-Plus for menopause symptoms,"I tried using this product for menopause symptoms supposedly caused by estrogen domininance. I started out with one capsule and didn't notice any difference in the way I was feeling, so I added a second capsule and all it did was give me extrememly bad trapped gas pain, escpecially if I took it with my dinner. I'm guessing it's because it's made with so many cruciferous vegetables. Sadly, I haven't found this product to be of any help to me."
2,bad menstrual cramps!!,"Its good for hormones, but when my cycle comes, I have extremely bad menstrual cramps! I would recommend for people who have unbalance hormones"
2,Not what was expected.,I took this product as recomended for a month and honestly did not notice any difference in anything. Some people reported using it longer to feel the effects so I took it for another month and still did not notice any difference.
4,DIYers Delight,"Having first seen this product used by the installer for my garage door I was intrigued. He explained to me that it worked well for the amount of abuse he gave his tools. Having recently procured one myself, to aid me in keeping my tools on me as I remodel my basement and garage I must say I am delighted with this tool. It Fits every tool I have. I can put up to four of them on my work belt and carry every tool I need for a job at the top of a ladder. (I do not like heights so the fewer trips up a ladder the better).As for the complaints about large tools, please not that on the manufacuters web site they say that Bigg Lugg 2 is rated for tools under 10 lbs.Bottom line; I like this product so much not only will I be getting more of them for myself I will be giving them as presents to my friends."
5,2012 TRUTH,"As many did, I personally felt the energy shift on the fateful date. This DVD, rather than spreading fear & panic, covers what the REAL significance of 2012 is--a change in the energy of the Earth, and the Human Race."
3,Nuclear War on United States and NEW YORK!,There is going to be a Nuclear War on the United States! There is going to be a Nuclear Attack on NEW YORK! World War 3! Certain Mountain areas will be safest.
4,Natural Black Cherry Concentrate,A little too tart for my family. I had to add Splenda or Sweet n Low to pick up the taste. Very tasty after that!
3,I prefer another brand,"This brand has more of the prune juice taste than another brand sold on Amazon. I do, however, prefer the bottle of this one. The other has a glass bottle that does not pour well, but tastes like fresh cherries. As far as relieving my arthritic symptoms, I do not yet know."
1,Like the taste of cough syrup?,This tastes very much like cherry flavored cough syrup. A few drips of vanilla extract (maybe 1/2 tsp per bottle) completes the illusion.
3,Black Cherry Concentrate,"This is a good buy, directions to mix, but is quite tart. I found mixing in half of a sugar-free drink-flavoringmix--of same flavor or other--made it more palatable."
2,Nothing like the preview,"The movie preview shows talking dogs with the song ""Who let the dogs out"" in the background, two things that send my 2 1/2 year old into uncontrollable laughter. There was a dream sequence where the dogs talk for about a minute and a half and at no point did I hear the Baha Men. My daughter did not mind, as a parent I felt the trailer was misleading. The story is for young kids and up, not really for toddlers. Had I known what the movie is really about I would not have paid to see it!"
5,Fun Movie to See,"This is a fun movie for adults and kids that includes little violence, no swearing and no sex! The humor is straight forward. The dogs are cute and they earned their 3000 pounds of dog food doing the movie. The story of a man living in Florida who finds out that he was adopted when his real mother dies and leaves him a bit of an inheritence is well done. The scenery of Alaska actually shows how beautiful Alaska is. Nichelle Nichols does a terrific job of playing Cuba Goodings adopted Mom in a comedic role. Cuba Goodings carries off his part beautifully, his facial expressions throughout the movie intensify the comedy. If you are looking for some fun and humor, I highly recommend this to you and your children!"
1,"Good movie, No WIDESCREEN","I like this movie, but when is Disney going to release the widescreen version. This is the age of DVD. I won't buy this movie until there is a widescreen DVD version."
1,SNOW DOGS,"My comments are not about the movie but about Disney's apparent decision NOT to release this movie in WideScreen. It is available (so far) in Full Screen only. I left ""my"" copy on the store shelf.Ken"
2,um let me think............THIS MOVIE SUCKS!,Ok this movie is most definetly A no no.It had like no plot.I saw it in theaters with my dadand I got really bord (plus there was this old lady coghing on by hair in the row in back of me) But anyway it was kinda stupiedand really boring.It was sopposed to be funny but it wasent.Itwould appeal to maybe A 7 or 6 year old.
1,Not your sturdy old Thinkpad,"I have used thinkpads for many years, and this new model is not up to the old standard. it's just another cheap Chinese laptop now that IBM has exited. The old styling cues and sturdy feel are gone. Try a VAIO."
3,Peral Harbor,"My thoughts on ""Pearl Harbor"" are two fold, both good and bad. The Good portion of this review is regarding the graphics used to dramatize the attack. I have never seen anything so spectacular as far as attack footage. To me the downside of the movie is the fact that far too much time was devoted to the love triangle, and not nearly enough time was devoted to the ""behind the scenes story"" of what the personnel in both Hawaii and Washington D.C. actually knew about what was about to happen to the naval and air bases located on the island. It is the opinion of this author that the movie ""Tora Tora Tora"" was of greater interest because of the detail which it went into regarding the planning of the attack as well as what was going on in Washington. In conclusion I would recommend that anyone who is a fan of military movies see ""Pearl Harbor""."
1,"worst movie of all time, does not deserve even one star","this was one of the worse movies of all time. the only goodthing about it is that can be a beanch mark for bad movies.in the future when i see a bad movie, i can say it was almost as bad as pearl harbor."
2,"See"" From Here To Eternity "" instead.","After Pearl Harbor finished playing.I had one thing on my mind.I must see ""From Here To Eternity"".Forget Pearl Harbor,Pearl,and Tora Tora Tora,From Here To Eternity is a efinately the film to watch instead."
2,Strange.,"Sick and shallow,Pearl Harbor might have been a better film with more guts and less gloss.Don't go expecting a history lesson and don't go expecting another Titanic.The love story was banal"
2,It's STILL tripe!,"...This movie is no exception. At 3 hours, it's just more torture for your money. With the additional features of this 'director's cut' I can't see what they were thinking ($$$) since the only reprieve from the rest of that...movie was the 45 minute action sequence. You can polish and cover up... all you want..."
1,A prime example of 21st century movie making at its worst,"Put extremely attractive young men and women into the fashions of 1941 but with the moral attitudes of the 21st century, add special effects, completely throw out any basis in actual fact in order to get an emotional reaction from the audience (here the film succeeds for all the wrong reasons), add a few rousing speeches, and you have Pearl Harbor. The only good thing about this film are the special effects, and even then I prefer the more primitively done Tora,Tora,Tora from thirty years before because it actually tells the truth about what led up to the raid in painstaking detail, actually taking the time to show what is going on with both the Japanese and the Americans and the mistakes and misjudgements made on both sides. If you want steamy love scenes and nicely done explosions, watch this film. If you want to learn something about history watch Tora, Tora, Tora. You won't regret it."
4,Why the bad rap?,"What was supposed to be the summer of 2001's biggest blockbuster turned into, in comparison, a flop. The movie critics called this movie things like, ""terrible"", ""boring"" and a cheap knockoff of legitamate war movies. Why? I really liked this movie! I mean, yeah, it had wasn't the most historically accurate movie and there was a cliche'd love triangle, but still it was a great movie. Movie critics were a bit harsh of this fine piece of cinema. If you give it a chance..and you're not overly critical..you will enjoy this movie for what it is: historical fiction."
4,Entertaining,"The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor provides the backdrop for a love triangle between a nurse & two best buddies.Although featuring some corny dialouge & clichès,it's still decent watching .The destruction of Pearl Harbor is spectacular to watch,with fireworks & explosions lasting about 40 minutes.The preformances are not bad at all,Voight does a great job playing FDR.Be sure to watch the film in widescreen."
2,Artistically awful,"this film fails in so many areas that I lost count.One-My girlfriend wanted to leave the room before the actual attack took place.The love story,which is 90% of the movie were putting me to sleep.It seems to me that they tried to pull off a titanic,it didn't work.Although during the attack which i felt was a perfect length I loved the shots,they were in fact beautiful.But don't forget ""tora tora tora"" did nearly the same thing with no digital effects. and actually it stole lines of dialogue word for word from that film.And Alec Baldwin taking credit for the Kamikazi....that's a Japenese thing sorry..American Pride needs to be pulled back just a bit i think.I'm not the only one who didn't want a lame charactered love story.Effects were excellent,but effects aren't everything.Sound in DTS 5.1 is great...Have not listned to the dolby 5.1 track yet.Worth buying only if you intend to use the attack scenes as a demo for system proformance.A.P.L"
1,Complete garbage,Why the hell they decided to make a love story the focus of a WAR MOVIE. This ping pong ball romance ruined this movie.
1,Absolutly a CLUNKER,"This is the worst example of a movie about the Pearl Harbor disaster that has been made. I am deeply disappointed that the youth of this time would be subjected to so much misinformation. The only plausable fact in the movie is that Pearl Harbor happened. Even the special effects are phoney. My, my , all those gas engine prop airplanes moved about the screen as it they were jet aircraft of today. The only believable special effects were the scenes that were ""borrowed"" form earlier movies about Pearl. There are too many distortions to itemize."
1,Insulting to veterans.,"This cartoonish 'film' was even edited in foreign markets, to increase sales. In Japan, Japanese involement in this attack was toned down in the movie! This is truly disgusting, a slap in the face to veterans and to history. FDR gets up from his wheelchair? I think he's rolling in his grave."
2,A great disappointment,"If you're looking for a great war epic like Saving Private Ryan you'll be greatly disappointed. The interaction between the main characters are shallow and it seems like an hour action movie with 2 hours of thin plots and poor scripts to fill it out. The love plot between the 3 characters are very corny and detracts from an otherwise okay action flick. I must admit the CG effects are very good and the action scenes are great but even with the action it seems to run out of steam towards the end with the raid of Japan scene. It seems very rushed and there's no sense of climax at all. Audio wise it's very average, no big gun sounds but instead sounds very tinny. Actually, the whole movie sounds very tinny besides the explosions which makes decent use of your subwoofer. If you're a die-hard war film fan and you've seen Saving Private Ryan there's little you'll appreciate in this movie."
1,Insult,The movie billed itself as a historical recreation of this major event in U.S. history. Instead it was a love triangle story with Pearl Harbor as the setting. Most of the history in the movie was flawed. This movie is an insult to Pearl Harbor veterans.
4,A truly eye opening on the attack on Pearl Harbor.,Most of this was good but the first 20 mins were slow.
1,VERY FUNNY,"make sure you rent this first - chances are you won't buy it.The attack part is great, but the other 90% of the movie is awful. The lines are SO CHESSY my friends and I were actually laughing during at the movie. Not a good thing for a movie that is supposed to be about Dec. 7.Most of the movie is a love story that is just silly. If you want to see a good Pearl Harbor movie, get Tora tora tora. This one will leave you with no clue about what happened that day.I really couldn't believe how bad this was. With one of the biggest days in history, and an unlimited budget, there is no excuse for this movie!"
3,Good but it does have its faults,"This is a well-made movie and its worth seeing but be forewarned that this movie is not without its faults. First of all its a war movie and they kind of focus on the three love triangle too much. They should've just focused on the facts and not the love theme.I think that it was overdramatic, it was way dramatic, more than usual and it shows. I think that the director did a poor job and frankly three love triangles are getting old. If they had to weave in a love story, they should have left out the love triangle. It was silly and pointless in a war movie.Anyways I liked it overall and I even own the movie, however it has its faults. Hollywood had their chance to make something out of it, but instead they failed to tell the story of Pearl Harbor the way it happened. They didn't tell it as well as they could've.Pearl Harbor was considered a flop at the box office because it didn't make as much money as the studio expected it would."
1,Is it good to be bad?,"Face it, kids. This movie is awful. Technical craft and quality cinematography, special FX and sound does not make it a good movie. (see BATMAN FOREVER).Don't chastise people for thinking this is a low-brow movie. And don't use the ""This is not a documentary"" excuse. It may not be a documentary but it is still called PEARL HARBOR. Therefore, it DOES have an obligation to be accurate about Historical facts. Fictional characters are fine. Bad fictional characters are not... P>Admit the darn thing is bad and move on with your life."
4,A story of courage,"I have just finished watching Pearl Harbor. All through the movie I could not believe that I listened to the critics and did not see this on the big screen. I heard that there was too much romance and not enough action. I am sitting here full of emotion seeing one of the most inspiring movies of all time. I watched courage, strength, honor, and great movie making. It was scenic, beautiful, electrifying. I was up moving around because the action was explosive and full of energy. I felt there was just about enough of everything to make this a wonderful movie. My hat is off and I salute to great entertainment. I come away feeling strength of purpose, after I whipped away tears from my eyes. I give this my four star rating."
4,Pear Harbor,"True to life special effects, Great story line. Great Acting. I watched this movie on my Kindle fire that I have had for about 8 months while flying back from Hawaii after visiting the WWII memorial."
4,NOT BAD,"THIS MOVIE IS A GOOD, MOVIE SET BACK DURING THE SECOND WORLD WAR, PRETTY SAD AT END LIKE IN THE MOVIE SAVING PRIVITE RYAN WHEREEEEE IM NOT GOING TO TELL U HAVE TO WATCH IT YOURSELF, WHAT IS MISSING IS THAT IT DIDN'T SHOW THE REST OF THE WAR IN THE PACIFIC AND WE DON'T NEED TO SEE ANY ROMANCE IN THIS MOVIE ITS ALL ABOUT THE WAR SO LET IT BE THE WAR, SO I GIVE IT A FOUR OUT OF FIVE."
4,Good but not great.,"Watch it if you can.It probably is worth the money but it won't have the ""wow"" effect on you when you finish it."
3,pearl harbor,"i thought that parts of this movie were good, but parts of it were kind of sappy. the action-filled parts were good, but the love parts were not very good. Overall, this movie was alright, but not the one of the best."
3,more love than war,"I am just back from a visit to the REAL Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. This is a fine love story, but the facts leading up to the attack, as well as what happened are better told in the 1970 classic TORA TORA TORA. Hollywood producers and directors added in computer enhanced gadgets to no credible benefit. I have met several survivors of the day of infamy who share this opinion. You must decide if you want a love story or a war history. You choose."
2,At least I THOUGHT it was about Pearl Harbor,"What is this? I thought this was about Pearl Harbor? The whole thing was practically swallowed by the love story!!! The only bit of WAR I saw was near the end of the movie. Oh yeah, one more thing: This movie is not R-rated. It's PG-13. It says so on the back of the DVD."
1,Tora Tora NOT!!!!!!!!!,"How can I describe this movie, simple, it is one of the worst I have EVER SEEN!!!! Really bad acting, very BORING story, throw in Jerry Bruckheimer and Michael Bay heavy handed overwrought special effects and direction and what you get one hell of a flashy movie with incredbly DUMB story lines and even worse acting. Except for the fact the Japanese did attack Pearl Harbor there is very little in this movie that is realistic. Even the Dootitle raid seems phoney. A very fat Alec Baldwin was terrible as Jimmy Dootitle, the special effects are so ridiculous that they are laughable and make the story seem like some sort of fantasy sci-fi, and that Love triangle PLLLLLLLEEEEEEEEEEEAAAASSSSSEEE!!!!!!!! This movie is simply terrible. I could wait to unload my DVD on [line], I was sorry I ever paid the money for it to begin with!!!!"
1,Utterly in shock.,"I canno't believe someone actually wrote this movie.This is the worst film i've ever seen.Stupidly obounds.You can bet ill bet getting my money back from Blockbuster.My 5 year old sister could write better romance lines.The movie should not have been called""Pearl Harbor.The part that didn't really happen""I mean,wow,to think that the only reason Pearl Harbor happened was because of 2 nurses friends."
3,Not actually about Pearl Harbor...,"This film wasn't actually about Pearl Harbor but about a love story centering around flat characters that I didn't care about. Cuba Gooding Jr. didn't get much more than five minutes onscreen which was somewhat of a letdown. However, I must say that the actual attack was spectacularly well created."
1,No 2 disc movies,"This movie was placed on two different discs. That is unacceptable. The movie can go on one while the supplemental can go on other. Do not purchase this movie until it comes out on just one disc. A DVD can hold the entire movie if they didn't try to cram in so many different features on disc. They should have put DD and DTS on different versions, that may have reduced the amount of data to one disc.Other than that great movie, good audio and video transfer, good features. Highly recommend once it's out on one disc."
3,Disappointing,"If the director is willing to take out about 2 hours of love stories and historical mistakes, add more historical FACT, this might be a superb movie.When I rent this vedeo, I was hoping to learn about the attack on Pearl Harbor, but sadly, it contains about 2 hours of love story(which is BORING). I also saw MANY historical error, which I feel angry. I'm not a Ben Afflick fan either.The ONLY thing that raise the rating is the stunning and superb battle scene. I highly recommand buying Tora! Tora! Tora! instead."
1,This is the Reason I Hate Blockbusters,"I hated this film. Hated it! It was chock full of cheap, insencere sentimentality and unnecissary violence. None of the characters were remotely believable, and you would expect better performances from the actors for the copious amounts of money they received to appear in this piece of fluff. I felt no connection with any of the characters. In fact, this film failed miserably to get any sort of emotional reaction out of me besides boredom and annoyance. The revisionist history and unquestioning idolization of the military all to present in this film were just the last straw for me. It's garbage like this that makes me lose faith in the blockbuster system."
4,Great film confusing sales point,"I liked this film and thats why I bought it, however when it said it was a two disk set I mistakenly thought (by the way it was worded) that it would have an extra disk with Pearl Harbor history on it. Nope, in fact if you want to watch the whole movie, you have to change to disk 2 to finish it.I am sure I should have been able to figure that out, but it wasn't really very clear and although I am not bummed I bought the DVD, I would rather have had everything on one Disk.Just my 2 cents"
4,Good but missing many elements,"I like this version of The attack on Pearl Harbor, but I thought somethings were lacking that were apparent in the focus on the love triangle.1. Dorie Miller: He was the first significant hero, but very there was very little coverage of him in the movie. Some of the coverage was unrealistic since the navy was segregated at the time.2. Japanese: There should have been more coverage about the Japanese in this picture, since they are a major part of this historical episode.3. Roosevelt: There was no coverage of his policy decisions such as the embargo against Japan.The plus is that the movie refreshed many people about this tragedy and why the sacrifices of these men must be remembered."
3,I didn't like this movie,"OK, so the actual attack scene was brilliant. That is not enough to make this a good movie. As was the case with ""The Titanic,"" this movie is as much a story about a romance as it is about the historic event it portrays. Quite frankly, much of the story line is predictable (ie, two best friends have a serious conflict over their common love interest) and the story line is extremely hokey. The greatest sin of this movie is that it drags on way too long. There was a way to end the story a half hour before the movie actually ends, but no, the screen writer ads on a whole additional story line that, although exciting, is too much already. I prefer an historical movie with less of a fictional story line, such as ""Tora Tora Tora."" However, if there has to be a story, please, let it not be a totally silly romance!!!"
1,Trey and Matt are right,"As Trey Parker and Matt Stone put it in their song from ""Team America,"" this movie sucks. It could have been a great story of this ""day of infamy"" but instead, Bay turned it into a sappy love story. What, the history wasn't exciting and emotional enough? Boo."
2,Could have been so much more,"This could have been a great movie, but it ultimately is a long, arduous picture. The events surrounding the bombing of Pearl Harbor are dramatic in and of themselves - the silly love story doesn't add anything except an extra hour. This is just another Bruckheimer/Michael Bay flick - Armageddon in the 40's. Same generic characters, same generic Zimmer score, same generic shots of tough guys looking cool in slow motion.On the plus side, the picture quality and sound of this DVD are absolutely top notch. It's almsot worth getting just to watch the half an hour sequens of the bombing of Pearl Harbor. If you have a decent home theater setup, this will really give it a workout."
4,Great Reenactment of History!,"I really enjoyed Pearl Harbor because of the special effects, but without the great plot, they wouldn't have mattered. I thought the actors and actresses chosen for the film were great. They delivered excellent performances and I actually understood what, with some exceptions, really happened on that fateful December day."
1,This Movie Is A Stinker!,"I was sitting in the theater wondering ""what is that horrible smell""? I finally realized it was the horrible movie on the screen I was suffering through. Very inacurate hoakey film."
2,Is it even funny how bad this movie is?,"Come on! People who say they like this movie are probably 14 year old girls who cried their eyes out when Josh Hartnett died at the end! Aside from the fact that all it is a sappy love story that just happens to be set in 1941. Why people thought they should make a love story about such a horrible day is a horrible idea in itself. That would be like making a movie about 2 people that fall in love and then get killed in the Sept 11 disaster! Except for the wonderful action scenes, this movie was downright bad! The only Oscar I hope it wins is for best special effects!"
1,One Star for the Authentic Video tape,"The romance is boring and predictable, Ben Affleck's lines are comparable to Fabio's in the ""It Must be Butter"" ads, and there is a paucity of authentic events. I expected something far more absorbing, a kind of ""Saving Private Ryan"" meets ""Titanic."" Save your money, your time, and your mental acuity. A thoroughly UNengaging flick."
4,"Folks, it's not a documentary.","This is a very intertaining movie about life as it was in 1941 before we were plunged into war. It's a love story set against the backdrop of military service in the Pacific theater. The costumes and characters are magnificent and capture the attitudes of that time. If you are looking for a documentary account of Pearl Harbor, then look to A & E or The Discovery Channel. If you are wanting to be entertained for a couple of hours, then this movie is for you. If you want facts, get a book on the subject. There are plenty available at your local library."
3,It's okay,The action was awesome! It was some of the best action I've ever seen. The romance ruined the movie. It was a shame that they put it in there. When I get the DVD I am going to just skip all the chapters with the love scenes.
3,"See it for the battle scenes, not the rest of the storyline.","It's a great represenation of what happened 60 years ago. The only ting I take issue with is the where of all the young men in the film are being so goofy, unconfident with women and clumsy in the first half for the sake of humour. It's a bit overdone.The acting other wise is well done, but Dan akroyd seems out of place, and Jon Voight's FDR make-up looks obvious in some shots. He could have pulled it off without it."
1,Hurl Harbor,"A film based on one of America's darkest hours, Pearl Harbor, is not one of any true value. The plot consists more of a crappy love story, then of any historical importance. Even with its strong supporting cast including Ben Affleck, Josh Hartinett, Jenifer Garner, and Kate Beckinsale; the story's poor character development and uncaptivating performances hinder enjoyment of the film. If I had to pick some decent part in the film, I would have to say it's when they show the devotion of the troops to defend the country after the attack, and near the end when the bombing run of Hiroshima and Nagasaki is shown. Other than that this film is nothing more than a waste of time and money."
1,Banzai!!!!!!!!,"Was this saber rattling claptrap really necessary? Pearl Harbor is a very expensive, inaccurate and stupid movie starring one of the worst actors around: Ben Affleck.And they spent even more money for a ""re-edit"" for audiences in Japan! How ridiculous, ""We're gonna get those ... Japs!"" changed to ""This is terrible, we must do something about it!"". If that is'nt bad enough, the love story will have you reaching for the ""Stop"" button on your DVD player."
1,A glurgefest that drags forever. Emphasis on fiction rather than history.,"This abominable excuse for historical fiction suffers from an overabundance of fiction and too little history. It is appalling to think that with the thousands of real people involved in the actual event, they had to dredge up two fictional cardboard cutouts to serve as the heroes. The attempt to insert some history with Cuba Gooding Jr. fails abominably as he is underutilized and his insertion into this lengthy melodrama is clearly forced and tokenism at its worst."
2,Hollywood bull#@&* filter,"The revisionist view that Hollywood continues to portray of pre-1960's America is on a tour-de-force in this film. The cinema action is first-rate but once again this is overshadowed by cliche lines, bad acting and post-hippie values of ""what America should have been."" The Japanese appeared real...the Americans like comic- opera heavies."
3,"More on love, less on true events","Pearl Harbor is more about two mens romance over one woman than about the war and that one eventful day.Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett make an incredible billing, but their performances just don't hold up as they try stumbling their way through. Then comes your usuall love triangle that hollywood seems to thrilled to be throwing out at us.Besides, do we really believe it was almost soley two men who saved Pearl Harbor that day?Cuba Gooding Jr. was wonderful in his short but beautiful scenes, he's just a natural, stealing every part from under the others and bringing more to the film than Affleck or HartnettOh, and the music is good, but if a true World War Two flick is what you crave, go watch Enemy at the Gates or the great Escape, don't bother with this one."
1,More patriotic pap that didn't exist.,"Pure popycock and predictable. Has very little signifigance with history or events that had to do with December 7th, 1941, just a crude backdrop for a weak story.Ben Afflick plays the marginally retarded toothy flyboy and a Matt Damon clone plays his strident friend.Very little is based on fact but as O have earlier stated, the story is predicable and weak.Avoid this stinker!"
2,the worst directors cut EVER!!!,I thought the origanal movie couldn't be any slower and longer but now they bring out a directors cut like i wouldn't mind if the origanal movie was like one hour and fourty minutes but it was like three hours! and no sex scenes thats all anybody would want to see in a directors cut and it's r rated so what would you expect?this version of the movie is really long like four disks?!i'm just glad i rented it because i would have my money back!so this gets a yopa & chewtabbaco rating of two thumbs down!imagine if they brought a titanic directors cut all hell would break loose !!!!!! so don't by it if your sane! please!
3,Too long.,"This movie had a great plot, directing, and acting. The problem with it was the fact that it was too long! If you took the frist half and shortened it to about 30-45 min. then keep the rest, I would have given it 6 stars!"
1,An assault on history.,This movie plays too fast and loose with history. It's a farce trying to pretend it's a drama. Why do we see Navy nurses doing routine nursing tasks for Army pilots? The Army had its own nurses. Where were they at the beginning of the movie? Are we to actually believe that Army fighter pilots re-trained to fly B-25's off a carrier deck in the brief interval between December 1941 and April 1942? How convenient to lay hands on that well-made coffin for Ben Affleck to bring back from Doolittle's raid. And the availability of real-time communications for the folks back home to monitor? Get serious. This movie is a joke.
1,"A bomb, as in abomination.","This bit of Hollywood schlock is an insult to history as well as all WWII veterans and their families. The film was made to reach one audience; love-sick pre-fifteen year olds raised on video games, period. If you have any interest at all in learning about the attack on Pearl Harbor, see Tora, Tora, Tora and forget this one."
3,Lousy movie in a great DVD.,"I give it 3 stars. 1 for the packaging of this dvd, 1 for the bombing scene and 1 for the dvd content. As for the story, it is really very boring. It tries very hard to be like titanic but failed big time. I feel that this show has no re-watch value but this dvd is great for collecting if you are into the extras in the dvd."
5,The best ever.,This movie is the best movie ever made and surpass Titanic.Don't listen to the critics because they're crazy.See this movie
2,"Should have, could have, wasn't","Pearl Harbor, from a history book point of view, is a great, compelling, and tragic story. The movie version is a hollywood-imitized discrace. My first and biggest problem is that the movie is about fighter pilots. That's cool, but what about the sailors? This is their storyline, not two hotshot fighter pilots. I think the movie should have been told from a sailor point of view (Cuba Gooding's 5 minuite part doesn't count). Also, the movie is about 40 minutes too long. If you are going to make a bad movie, at least make it a short bad movie. Don't make us sift through 2 1/2 hours of (...) so we can see twenty minutes of the battle. Unless you are a real war enthusiest or were there for the actual attack, don't even bother with this."
1,How many times can they try to sell the DVD,"This movie is sooo bad, can you say titanic 2, I,m suprissed that rose dawson didn't come back on screen and tell of a love she had while she was a nurse in Pearl Harbor(tear.) the really wanted to have the succss of Titanic but it flopped with the critics and movie goers. It is now obvious that they had way too many of the P.H. DVD's made because they try to resell in in new packaging. whats next Pearl Harbor the waist of time Edition with 2876 hours of bonus footage. Stay away from this Hollywood version of pearl harbor. plus faith hill's song is trying to be a total rip off of the Titanic song."
3,Great Chick Flick - minus the war scenes,"This movie attempted at satisfying both sexes with both war and love. Unfortunately, this was unsuccessful because there wasn't enough war and gore to keep males interested, leaving the only audience to be sappy females who didn't want the war scenes at all. I find myself fast forwarding through all the parts that don't pertain enough to the love story aspect of the movie."
1,Star Wars meets Titanic,"Pearl Harbor has been bombed again but this time not by the Japanese. This time the culprits were prefabricated Hollywood melodrama.This movie is an appalling bore. The main characters are wooden and uninteresting.The selling point of the movie is the high-tech special effects. Even this is unconvincing when aerial dogfights between the adversaries are much more akin to ""Star Wars"" than World War 2.This movie should be locked away forever."
4,"I like the movie a lot, but .........","I had heard that the DVD release of the movie would be like a directors cut ""R"" rated version with extra footage. I was also told that there would be less emphasis on the love story and more on the war and battle scenes.Nothing of the sort is true on my version. Yes the love story is a little long , but a least MS. Beckinsdale is nice to look at.Also, one major problem with the DVD version are the subtitles. When the parts featuring Japanese language are on. the subtitles are on the movie screen rather than on the black screen below as should be the case. As a result the titles are a little blurred and very small . One must get right up to the screen to read them.I have a 27"" screen. Even if you use english subtitles when watching the film, during the Japanese parts this problem still exists. Oh well, still a good movie and love the doolittle raid part !!!!! Very patriotic film too !!!!!!"
3,Great special effects!,"Nice story line, loved Alec Baldwin as Jimmy Doolittle as he planned the raid. Also, Ben Afleck was good. Some of the historic props may not have been accurate, but overall, a good flick."
1,Was This Movie Really Necessary?,"Hollywood cynicism knows no bounds in this ""Titanic Meets Tora! Tora! Tora!"" rehash. ""Pearl Harbor"" (2001) was made specifically for viewers too young to remember the Oscar-winning ""From Here to Eternity."" The producers could have saved a fortune by reissuing director Fred Zimmerman's 1953 classic - thus sparing us three hours of bad cinema. Nearly as embarrassing as the 1982 fiasco ""Inchon."""
1,Movie that most disappointed me ever.,"Quite simply, I was very much looking forward to this movie, but have never been more disappointed in a movie in my life."
2,"Good action,bad movie.","I saw this movie last night.It was disappointing.The dialogue in this movie was awful,the love story did not work,especially with the... lines that the actors were spraying.The action scenes were impressive but they were not enough to get me to recommend the movie to the whole."
5,The Best Movie Made,"Pearl Harbor is based on the attack on this Harbor on December 7, 1941, a day that will live in ifiamy. The movies stars (someone who evry female knows) Ben Afflect(raindeer Games), Josh Hartnett(Halloween H20), and the hottie Kate Bekisale(brittish filems) Ben is a pilot named Rafe and Josh is a Pilot, and they are all great friends and ohh it is Such a GOOD, sad, action pack film i can't write anymore There will be antother rewiew that you can read called the greatest movie made!! Cheak out the CLient rewiews and i have one of them called Fantastic Page Turner!! So sorry that this review was so bad but i have to go"
1,Guaranteed to make you barf!,"Listen to some of these lines from just the first half hour:""I got some genuine French champagne, from France, and I thought we could celebrate you being my hero.""Ben - ""You are so beautiful it hurts."" Kate - ""It's your nose that hurts."" Ben - ""I think it's my heart.""""If I had one more night to live, I'd want to spend it with you.""""It's so cold it goes deep into my bones, but there's one place I can go that's warm and that's to think of you.""""Every day I look at the sunset and try to draw the last ounce of heat from the long day and send it from my heart to yours.""After that last one, I just couldn't take it anymore! Blecchhh!"
2,What a Waste!,"Very disapointed in this movie...if it weren't for the battle scenes I would have written it totally off! The love triangle was absolutely stupid as were all the women in it (retired female Marine here). My husband and kids (ages 14-18) also preferred the battle scenes and shared my opinions about the sappy love story! Too bad, I really looked forward to it. ""Memphis Belle"" was much better. Can't wait to see that on DVD! Thanks...."
3,Tora Tora Tora was better,"Why is it the producers or director felt they had to put in a love triangle? Do we need that in a movie about Pearl Harbor? I don't think so. Someone said it was a perfect telling of the story? Are you kidding? Were you there? I doubt it. This triangle only detracted and made the movie longer than it needed to be. I won't buy this movie because of the love triangle. the action sequences, music, sound, and acting were outstanding. To bad the contrived love triangle drug down the movie."
3,Of Love & War,"It reminded me of Titanic. A tragic historic event clouded with a love story. The action scenes were fast paced with good special effects but the romance within the movie slowed down the whole pace. The interviews of real survivors, and accounts of the attack from witnesses, that follow the end of the movie are worth watching."
3,If you are American you may like it,"This film is not historically correct and too patriotic in my view, but has some nice special effects."
1,Very Disappointing,"The makers of this film squandered an opportunity to use modern film making technology to chronicle for a new generation one of history's most compelling stories. Instead, we got a trite love story/soap opera and a ridiculous series of events with the lead character (Ben Affleck) fighting the Battle of Britain, fighting the Japanese at Pearl Harbor (while reminding me of scenes and dialog from TOP GUN), and then bombing Tokyo. As a career Naval Aviator and student of history, I found the events depicted in a manner so inaccurate (read: ""Hollywood"") as to be insulting to the participants. I found the choice of Alec Baldwin to play Col. Dolittle especially revolting. There would have been more than enough drama in the truthful and accurate representation of some of the most significant events in our history...it's a shame the makers chose to make a film of this disappointing caliber."
2,Please Cannibal Corpse Mature A little,"I like Cannibal Corpse but god can they get off all gorecore stuff for at least one song. I mean how old are they and all they talk about is killing and all that stuff. I could understand a couple of songs but not EVERYONE they make. At least bands like Nile talk about something interesting and not about killing 24/7. I acually change my mind I dont like them at all, I think I'll stick with Nile. Later"
3,On deaf ears...,"Amazon.com offers no recourse to users who stumble across reviewers like Hydonymous. This individual merely reposted -- verbatim -- his or her thorough panning of this album as a review for several other thrash/death metal albums. How this happens is a mystery to me.In any event, metal has always been about saturation/drama/extremity. Cannibal Corpse and the genre in which they work are the logical end to the decades-long game of ""one-ups-manship"" that is metal."
1,TOTAL COOKIE MONSTER VOCALS,"cant believe kids like this.....it sounds like the cookie monster singing along to some bad metal....the album covers are very entertaining and thats pretty much it...if you want real metal, listen to Winger......haha just kidding.....kids, please just listen to Slayer....no gimicks with those guys....the read deal...this is just trying to be scary, and it is not scaring me...."
1,THIS IS MUSIC?,"First off I would like to say I am a heavy metal fan I'm into bands like Pantera, Anthrax, Slipknot, and Black Sabbath among others but this crap is the stupidiest stuff I have ever or will ever hear in my lifetime. the person who buys this sh*t is more disturbed than the band themselves. the riffs are great but the vocalist sings like a cow on crack and it just ruins the whole music aspect andit makes you quiver in disbalief that this crap actually has a cult followig. this band is too crazy and/or retarded to listen to so please dont waste your valuable time and money on this garbage"
1,The worst excuse for music!,"This is the worst form of noise I've heard in my life. The songwriting is bad and repetitive. And of course, the cover art is the worse thing on the planet. It makes me sick to look at it. The repeat the same thing with each disc they release. Cannibal Corpse is the worst band on Earth. Want metal? Try Slayer or Pantera. Metallica's first five CDs would do just fine."
1,What is the deal with these guys?,"CC is pretty bad compared to other metal bands. But WHAT... is up with them? They must be very disturbed, their song titles and lyrics go to the point of being ridiculously obscene. Man."
1,A CD that is Covered With Sores,"I can't believe people waste and ruin their lives on this garbage. And I thought Slipknot was terrible. I might as well form a gore-metal band and hire an amatuer drummer, two guitarists who know about maybe two or three chords, and an average bassist. As a vocalist, I will write gross, sick, and perverted lyrics, and make silly grunts, grumbles, and gurgling noises while saying only half the lyrics. As a band, we will write sick and repulsive subject matter just to shock the public and make people feel sick, make gross and graphic cover art(especially horrible ones agianst women) to do just the same, make nothing but sick noise instead of music, and send violent messeges through our ""music"" in order for our fans and listeners to commit all sorts of acts of violence, and walla! You have another gore-metal band just like Cannibal Corpse. And don't forget another school shooting."
1,Um...,"I think you might of sent the wrong C.D. I got ""Coming Up To Breathe"" instead of ""Undone"", but it's alright as long as it's MercyMe!"
1,Don't waste your money,"While this book might give some helpful tips for brand new student nurses, 2 weeks on the floor will do the same as the book. I spent 2 hours skimming the book and learned about 2 new things. Some tips were dangerous/illegal/harmful to patient--take this one--while finding a vein for blood draws mark the spot with your fingernail (digging it into the patient, I guess) and you'll be all set, it also prepares the patient for what the stick of the needle feels like! (like they need to be jabbed twice). Half the tips were not even practical, some of these nurses must only have 2 patients to have the time to use these tips. I'm not making charts and laminating patient education booklets in my free time and not getting paid for it. If you are even thinking about buying this book here's my tip for you--find the most experienced nurse on your floor, follow them for a shift, and watch everything they do. You'll learn more from them than this book, I guarantee it."
5,totally awesome,"I bought the first 3 seasons of Will & Grace. It is the funniest program of all time to me. I had lost my husband, had alot of arrangments and bills to pay, and try to go on with my day and take care of my daughter. I had zero reason to smile, and couldn't if I tried. Well, buying the discs I knew they would make me smile. Laugh even. When I get to feeling down, I pop one in and watch it. It helps me alot. I am gonna get the rest soon as I can afford them. Again, Totally Awesome!!!"
5,FUNNY FUNNY FUNNY and real FUNNY,"Really, you want me to say more? Okay, but I'm sure you've heard it all before. Finally a TV sitcom that really is funny, for everyone. You could be the straightest person on earth and any one of the four great actors will make you laugh, especially Karen. Not that she's better than the rest only that her character get to say all the things we'd love to say to people but never do (she's a NASTY girl). Let's hope that we don't have to wait until next year for season 2. P.S. To the writrers if they're reading this, don't expand Jack and Karen's roles, they're only good because you've kept them at bay, keep up the great work."
4,Good But could be Great,"I have been a fan of ""W&G"" since the day it premiered. Love the show and the interaction between all 4 stars. Alone----they shine with ability and talent. Together they are radiant, hilarious, witty, sincere, and spontaneous. I was thrilled to see the first season available. BUT.....I was expecting more in the way of extras (outakes, interviews, etc)....the section with the interviews is difficult to hear, had to have sound turned up higher for it. I am sure that there are zillions of ""bloopers"" and some should of been instilled in this set. However it is a wonderfully put together set and fun to see the shows with no commercials. Despite the lack of extras I will wait with baited breath for Season 2 to come available."
1,Make sure you know if its the repackage version or the box set.,I bought this thinking it was the box set like in the pictures and since the description never mentioned repackage version i bought it.What i received was the repackage version and it doesn't look good its just a DVD case. Make sure you ask the seller what version they are selling before buying it since the description is misleading.
1,This is a must buy,"If you are a fan of the Will & Grace show then you definitely should buy Season One. I enjoyed the interviews with the cast, directors and creator. I learned a lot of behind the scenes informations. Do yourself a favor and buy it."
1,A big DUD --- avoid this one like the plague!,"Women-in-prison films are supposed to be erotic! That means they're supposed to have AT LEAST ONE of the three following things (and preferably MORE than one):1) An evil lesbian warden who enjoys the bodies of her pretty prisoner-playthings, turning at least one of them into her beautiful nude sex slave.2) Evil lesbian guards who occasionally strip the girls naked before whipping/spanking them, and later take them into their own quarters for their private pleasures, especially late at night.3) Tough, lesbian inmates, who prey on the younger, most beautiful newcomers, often in the shower, but also in their beds at night.Well, this particular video HAS NONE OF THESE THINGS! There are NO LESBIANS in this prison! There are only gay male guards and a boring old man as the warden. The women are certainly pretty enough and their outfits revealing enough, but as a women-in-prison flick THIS ONE SUCKS!!! IT'S NOT EROTIC!!! NOT RECOMMENDED!!!"
3,"spill resistant, not proof","I bought this from another site and its a good lookin keyboard, the keys feel great and plenty of multimedia buttons. As the other reviewer said the key lettering is white, so when u turn on the backlight u cant really see the letters. Also i spilled a small amount of beer on this and what do you know the keyboard cheesed out on me :(."
5,OUTSTANDING NEW BOOK - AN ABSOLUTE MUST READ,I'm not in the business of advertising but I just finished reading the book a few minutes ago and it may very well replace all those other books on the market. It goes beyond the simplistic explanations and advice. It may well be the closest book we have these days to a definitive guide to protecting our children from the loss of their fathers!
1,I Was Carlos Castaneda:The AfterLife Dialogues,"Ouch! This book is truly terrible! A New Age embarrassment. For real info about the Castaneda world, read Amy Wallace's Sorcerer's Apprentice, and ditch this awful book. It panders to the lowest element of New Age self-importance."
1,mixordia,"I was trying to ... write ... a bestseller .... but I ended up with more than 60 used copies of this book being sold at Amazon for less than $2, no interest at all from buyers .... I gave up ... my next book will be : I was George.W.Bush, to be published by November 11, 2004. Please remember my name (the other one, not the Castaneda one), I'll finally become famous !"""
2,It ends in tears,"After two near classic industrial metal albums, Skrew %$&^ed the dog. It's not that Shadow of Doubt and Angel Seed XXIII are necessarily BAD albums, for any other band they'd be good, but for Skrew they're horrible.Is this really the same band that put out Burning in Water/Drowning in Flame and Dusted?Angel Seed isn't quite as bad as Shadow, to be fair. That album was held back by far too slow songs that seemed to drag on forever. This album feels like their treading water, either by sounding like a poor carbon copy of their early glory days, or by sounding like a poor carbon copy of bands they influenced, only with bits of Korn and Limp Bizkit thrown in. And that is not a good thing.Either way, you should skip this and Shadow, and go straight for the first two albums."
3,The Bride,not really a review more just a note from your cast list. YOU FORGOT TO PUT JONATHAN WAITE IN YOUR CAST LIST HE PLAYED ONE OF THE SERVER BOYS . Please amend thanks
3,"For fans of Frankenstein, Sting, or Jennifer Beals.",This movie is hard to review. I guess it's for fans of Frankenstein and/or Jennifer Beals. I can understand why some people won't like the picture. I enjoyed it. The relationship between the monster and the midget is very entertaining and touching. Jennifer Beals is so beautiful that who couldn't take your eyes of this picture for her alone! I do have to slam the comentary. The director rambles on about things that are not interesting. Directors should watch their movies and take notes and then record the comentary. This guy doesn't get to the point and changes topics while in the middle of sentences. Aside from that I am glad this film is out on DVD. The scenery is beautiful and it's a great escape from reality. Imagine if you can make yourself a bride that looks like Jennifer Beals. What a fantasy!!
1,Thin? Try see-through,"I read the reviews and was prepared for these to be thin. But ""thin"" is an understatement. They're more like sheer curtains. They don't absorb anything because there isn't enough cloth. I thought about folding them up and using them as burb clothes, but they're too rough for infants. Don't waste your money."
2,DIAPER DILEMMA,"Buying diapers again after 27 years, as a grandmother, I was disappointed. I expected a soft cloth. These are not what I was expecting. I recall the large single ply diapers that were excellent for everythin and also the prefilded ones that were as soft as a cloud. These are rather flimsy but I guess for a lap pad they will work."
1,Poor quality for any use,"We decided to try these cloth diapers as burp clothes since friends told us it's not worth paying the premium on burp cloths. I just washed these Gerber ones for the first time and they came out of the washer/dryer wrinkled, tattered looking. The fabric/yarn from all four corners pulled out so I had to take a scissor to trim them off. I imagine the next time we put them in the washer, the fabric will just keep pulling out. What a disappointment! The material is extermely, key word, extremely thin. I don't see how these could hold up anything if used as a diaper. The material feels really rough. When we use it as a burp cloths I have to fold it 3 times to make it a little thicker and absorbant otherwise it just leaks right through.Unfortunately I already washed all 12 and can't return them. I am going to just pay the higher premium for real thicker, softer burp cloths."
1,Disapointed...,"I bought these diapers to use as dish towels since I had been using old birdseye diapers this way for many years because they are soft, smooth and very absorbent. They also tolerate being bleached every week. These that I got from Gerber were horrible quality fabric, rough, uneven, thin and the machine hems are uneven and ugly. These are no better than cheese cloth rags. I wish I knew where to get the real thing."
1,Lies and More Lies,"Made in China crap...NOT made in the usa. Typical Gerber lies. Yes I know, got sucked into ordering and Chinese crap showed up...who knows what chemicals it's tainted with. Look someplace else if you want made in the USA and expect a quality product."
3,Not your grandma's diapers,"These diapers are not the thick fluffy cloth diapers of yesteryear but they work well as cheese cloth and cloth filters. Since I bought them for that reason, they work for me, but I think they are too coarse for baby diapers."
3,Useful for everything but diapering!,"Thin almost gauzelike. I have never used these as diapers. My husband uses them as sweat rags basically when riding his bicycle. We used these for five years and just had to order more. Useful also for dusting, cleaning glassware etc."
4,Good for Burp Cloths,We bought these to use as burp cloths for our daughter. They work well to absorb any little messes she makes. I suggest buying a couple and placing them strategically around the house so you always have one in reach!
2,Cloth,They took time figuring out how I could best use them. Meanwhile he's soiling everything up around him before I could get it folded and refolded because the diaper is so big
4,we use them as cloth diapers,"Love these! Absorbent, soft, inexpensive, held up well after many MANY washes, no stains, ect. My only complaint is that they shrink quite a bit.My daughter has always hated wearing disposable diapers. When she was a newborn, she'd holler whenever we tried to put one on her. As she got older, she'd arch her back, scream, and try to get away as we were putting the diaper on her. So when she was a newborn, I used these flat folds wrapped oragami style (no plastic cover, although you could use one) to give her a break from her disposable diaper. We've actually made the switch to cloth diapering full time. Now I use these as a cloth insert for the gdiaper (fold in fourths, then half) and Thirsties (fold in thirds, then half). You could also easily use these to stuff pocket diapers."
2,Too thin,"Whether you are using these diapers for diapering or for burp cloths, I suggest you look at the version with the padded absorbent center. This version is too thin to serve as either a burp cloth or for diapering. However, the same brand, with the absorbent center pad, is much better."
3,a bit uninspiring unfortunately.,"I would LOVE to enjoy this but I find it doesn’t have quite the edge to make this a great piece of drama. There is nothing gripping about this, its just OK."
4,First Season: Very Good = 4 Stars; Second Season...,"Okay, so the first ""season"", the three episodes focusing on Jack the Ripper, is very good. Very intriguing, well acted and scripted. Just when you think there can be no new take on JTR, leave it to these guys to make something new and enthralling. I can't add much to what has been said here, I really enjoyed this show and it deserves the 4 star and 5 star ratings it has. My rating is for this first season only.The subsequent ""seasons"" of which I believe their are 2 or 3 were pure garbage. Overacting, ludicrous story lines, implausible situations. It's like some yahoos bought the rights after the first season and hired some teenage creative writing students to do the subsequent seasons. There are some interesting horror-artsy cut scenes played over and over but overall, it's crap. I watched them all to see if the magic of the first would come back. It never did. 1 star for the rest of the seasons."
3,"Strong acting, but dark and slow paced","New detective in charge has adifficult time getting a disparateteam behind him to solve a string of Ripper copycat murders,while pressure from politically motivated bosses seems to beat odds with solving the mystery."
1,Worthless with OS X,"The keyboard is supposed to be compatible with OS X, but it's not. The biggest problem is that the keyboard is hypersensitive and repeats almost every letter, even with the system prefs adjusted. There's also a delay before anything appears on screen. So I guess it's also undersensitive. I found the joy stick hard to control, but maybe one could get used to it. The construction seems very cheap. Also: I emailed the company for help on the repeat keys over a week ago and got no reply. I'm returning to ergogeek, where I bought it. Ergogeek, by the way, seems like a great company. No complaints there."
2,WHAT?,"I have always loved Sissy spacek, since she both broke my heart and scared the hell out of me in CARRIE. She earns her two stars, above, simply for being in a film. She remains powerfully watchable in an interesting role. However -- this film, which begins suspensefully, if not surprisingly, eventually crashes and burns with a made-for-TV movie ending. It really does not deserve the accolades it has been bestowed these past few weeks. The quiet, introspective quality of the film has nothing over ORDINARY PEOPLE, which is infinitely more moving and explosive. The performances are good, and the narrative is solid, until the final 20 minutes, at which point I wanted to leave the theatre -- not because I was disturbed, quite the opposite -- because I wasn't. Most of all, it has nothing to do with redemption, as the glossy TV ads suggest."
1,I almost fell asleep,"If they cut an hour out of it, it could easily be a low-budget, boring TV movie. That's how awful it was. The acting was bad. The directing was bad. I kept hoping something exciting was around the corner but I was wrong. Luckily I rented it and didn't waste money to own such a flat, pointless excuse for a movie. The ending was so dumb. No wonder it didn't win any Academy awards. Don't even think about wasting your time on this one. This isn't the DVD you're looking for. Move along."
1,Horrible. Told me nothing.,"The movie poster outside my theater had so many good comments about In The Bedroom, which is why I went to go see it. Were they seeing the same movie I saw?While the events and the characters were realistic, the flat plot didn't make for a good movie. (And I don't think the trailer portrayed the film accurately.) I wished I got my money and time back!Yes, a murder tears the loved ones apart.Yes, it's not a typical subject.Yes, I saw the subtext (what was not said supposedly spoke volumes) and it STILL did not carry the movie.No, the film wasn't particularly dark. Also, other movies that showed degradation of the character(s) were more interesting than this one.In the end, I was left thinking, ""So what?"" Again, this movie said nothing to me.All I can probably suggest if you're still interested in seeing it is to wait until it comes out in the movie channels or somebody rents it and you'll end up seeing it for free."
2,Highbrow Sucker Punch,"Surprisingly few films attempt to show us believable people faced with extraordinary circumstances. In the Bedroom became a critics' darling owing to its initial movement theretoward. By the time the crisis is exposed, we're convinced we've never seen anything quite like it. The film then meditates on its own riveting magnificance for a good long while before tacking on an ending that provides resolution without context, one that is utterly shocking for its utter lack of shock. Like a Bernie Madoff investor, you'll be haunted by questions of how you'd ever been convinced to expect otherwise."
1,SUCKS SUCKS SUCKS!!!!,"I was very disappointed when I watched the movie ""In The Bedroom"" It takes a five minute plot and streaches it out for 2 hours by filming pointless chatter, and objects. It has to be the boringest suckiest movie I've ever seen in my life. When we saw it in the theatre, at the end of the movie, EVERYONE in the audience was BOOING and yelling ""SUCKS!"" When I went to the ladies room, 2 women were dicussing how it was the most pathetic movie they had ever seen. The preview makes it seem way more exciting then it is. The most suspenseful part of the movie is waiting to see when the excitement will come. It unfortunatly never does....I give this movie two enthusiastic thumbs DOWN! The acting was wonderful, however the movie was NOT. Don't go see this movie, unless you are having trouble sleeping. It will cure you instantly. Happy snoring."
3,Its in the Closet!,"Obviously In the Bedroom is Oscar worthy because of its great performances and how its plotline almost hits home ,but on the surface it is boring and awfully dark. The film rambles a lot and many times where it stays on one camera shot more longer than we need. There is hardly any music in the background (It's like American Beauty without its strange beat).With a soap opera like story after a while you do get attracted to it."
3,"Good plot, original,but very slow.","I liked the plot and the acting was excellent,but I was very dissapointed with this movie. It was too drawn out. I was expecting more, due to the great reviews,but I wasn't too impressed. All of the action was in the first half hour then it was about an hour of reactions just wacthing the parents ignore each other, a little action in the end, and it's over. I really didn't get what was so great about it."
3,Couldn't live up to the hype,"Finally getting around to watching a movie that has received so much notice and praise is very often a disappointing experience. Watching ""In the Bedroom"" was one of those experiences. It's not so much a bad movie as it is underwhelming. There's really nothing extraordinary about it. Somehow, it seems that the slow pace, the stillness (there's very little accompanying music), and the idyllic setting are all trying to convey something deeply meaningful that instead comes across as pretentious. I won't say that I hated it or even that it was flat-out boring, but it could have been tighter, shorter, and less self-important."
2,A huge letdown.,"In the Bedroom was nominated for a lot of Academy Awards a few years ago and to my disappointment, this film is slow and boring from beginning to end. I was expecting so much more from this critic's darling and even though Tom Wilkinson is a great actor, I am sorry to say not even his flawless acting could save this shallow train wreck. In the Bedroom is just one of those films with great acting but the plot is weak and never gets off the ground. The ending is just plain horrible, didn't see the that one coming, ugh!"
1,Suggests the Works Of Bergman and Herzog,"in the bedroom is boring there are no guns in it. Well, there are, but not enough. it wasnt funny either it should have had lots of laughs. everyone is talking i was thinking where are the explosions, guns. more people should have died. its too quiet. i cant believe this was nominated for oscar and rollerball wasn't. i know that wasn't released in 2001 but black knight or double take should have they were funny and had action. this is a bunch of [junk] dont see it."
1,An excruciating experience,"One has to wonder just what film was the director trying to make.It starts as a lively, entertaining study of family dynamics. Then it shifts to a long, interminably boring segment that's supposed to be a study of grief but is, in reality, just a long series of under-directed vignettes that all fade to black and give absolutely no motivation whatsoever for what follows. And what follows is yet another wrenching, inexplicable shift into the vigilante/revenge genre.... When there are some film-makers out there that really know how to tell a story, who do critics go ga-ga over a film-maker who largely depends on the audience to fill in the emotion he can't seem to put on the screen?"
2,hmm..,"As being a huge fan of the books and the movies.This was rather dissapointing. Comparing some of the LOTR's characters and battle odds to Franklin Roosefeld, the British army against the French and some other battles and persons in human history.You can fill in the rest yourself.."
3,Really disappointing,"When I saw this I was happy for another show about Lord of the Rings because I love the books and the movies, but this is not really about the LOTR, is more about war and, really strange explanations about how is LOTR linked to history. I like History, I'm a historian myself but when I watched this I was expecting something really different :(, I give it 3 stars because I did had some spoilers about ROTK, but as a National Geographic work??, is not worth that much."
1,Has got nothing to do with the movie.,"I have lots of National Geographic DVDs as they have some eccellent ones,but this DVD is the most absurd NG DVD that I have ever seen because it has absolutley nothing to do with the actual film. Fortunately,I watched it on television first and didn't waste my money.It is about explorers and their companions of the last century and isn't really that interesting. Beyond the movie my foot,it has nothing to do with the film.Come on National Geographic,you have nearly 300 VHS tapes of documentaries that you could release to DVD,so why give us this piece of junk?This documenatary is going to ne on the ""Lord Of The Rings:The Return Of The King"" DVD movie set to be released on May 25th,perhaps as padding.So if you are going to buy the LOTR's movie,save your money."
4,not too bad,"I just bought this unit a few days ago. I tried both the VCR and DVD and for the money, I find it not too bad. The sound that it provides when connected to a stereo system is really theater sound quality. The quality of the DVD video is pretty darn good.The VCR could be of better quality, but it's at least better than what I replaced it with (it was a Sanyo VCR). If your a connissuer of audio/video tecky stuff, you may not like it. But for the average TV viewer or mom and dad looking to upgrade their their entertainment center on a budget, you won't be disappointed. It's not hard to learn all of it's functions, and the remote is easy to use once you've tried it a few times.If the picture quality for the VCR could of been a few tads better, I would have given it a 5 star rating. But as I said, for the money, it's a pretty decent dual DVD/VCR player."
4,Long Live the Combo !,"I have owned this unit for many many years now. I purchased it when it first came onto the market. It has lasted me for more than 5 years wihout any problem. I am now beginning to notice the DVD player is freezing and skipping. For what I paid for it, I know I got my money's worth. It's a tough work-horse unit."
2,It was a good camera....,"I've had this camera since March '05 and have nothing but great results with it. The camera was a gem up until last month when it just suddenly stopped working. Some sort of malfunction with the lens thus preventing me from taking any sort of decent picture. It's now in the repair shop with Sony and hopefully will be back in time to capture my son's first birthday on the 24th.Am noticing a trend though with the various mechanical complaints. Might want to invest in something different, especially since the warranty only covers the camera for a year. If Sony hadn't agreed to cover the repair costs themselves,the cost out of my pocket would have been $180...told them I'd rather buy a new camera and could guarantee them that it wouldn't be a new Sony."
2,Maybe I got a lemon,"I'm blown away by the positive reviews of this camera. It doesn't snap the picture when you hit the button, and the delay is ridiculous when you are trying to shoot pictures of children. It takes too long to reset after the flash goes off. I find that it really only takes consistantly good photos outside on sunny days, mainly because you don't need to deal with the flash. Indoors in low light, forget about it. I don't even waste my time trying. I've been very disappointed by this camera."
5,Best Book on Hypnotherapy I have read so far.,It is written for the layperson and does not have an academic approach with a lot of qualifers on each statement or references to other academics. Thus it is easy to read and is very entertaining. The first two chapters discuss the backgrounds and histories of the authors and thus help the reader make a connection with who is doing the therapy. I never would have found this book in a conventional book store and I was happy to come upon it shortly after publication. I have lent it to several people and bought if for several others. Everyone said they couldn't put it down and they couldn't stop thinking about what was said in the book. One person is now very interested in exploring her past through regression therapy. The book does give some good advice about finding and choosing a hypnotherapist.
5,"IT, IS A MUST READ","Craig Groeschol has found it,every church leader must read it,and every church staff must have it. Craig Groeschol has opened the door to what we all live for it. Is a leadership jem. Hope you catch it, your church catchs it."
1,Wow. I'm Completely Amazed.,"This was, quite simply, the worst anime movie I ever sat down to watch. It's the worst one I've ever purchased, that's for sure. Blues singing (very, very bad blues singing) mixed with the old west in the middle of a futuristic city and a dark rider in a carriage... if done well it could have actually worked out quite nicely, the concept could have been interesting. But this isn't well done. It's not even medium rare. It's road kill. It's just bad.Since every other review has been good, I have to say: Sorry if you liked it and I've made you mad, but I really think it's crap. You can call me bad names and say I'm stupid if it'll make you feel better."
4,Excellent Animation,"As far as the story goes, this one isn't worth too much, for the story was way too complex to capture in an hour an a half movie. The animation, however is top of the line, and is just as smooth and well made as Ghost in the Shell. If you're looking for a great story, look elsewhere. If you're into well drawn animation, go for it."
4,This is a great record!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Hecate is like Cradle of Filth, but Hecate is more speed and agressive.....buy this records is very good...i like so much, the guitars are more loud and vocals are very terrific......"
3,Good album,"Reviewing this about 4 years or so after I bought it. I did not ever listen to it much, I enjoy more of the blackmetal sound then the vampire goth sound for music. If you enjoy Cradle Of Filths older stuff you may really enjoy this band. Especially since Cradle has went major mainstream Goth crap rock."
5,Cybersona will pull you in!,"In this world of computer savvy, readers will be enthralled with the premise of ""Cybersona"" by Fred Yager. The reader will take a journey through cyberspace like never before....The story is rich with imagination, intrigue and mystery. This novel is a real page turner----a must read for all who enjoy excellent fiction----then again, the concept is so unique---who knows? The virtual experience in the story might materialize in the future!!Sue M. Cold Spring Harbor NY"
3,Odd Reviews and Awkward Product Page ...,"I'd consider ordering this book, but the reviews seem confusing. Is it the same old translation by Thomas Carlyle or not? If it is that translation, it's not worth the paper to print it or the electricity to transmit it.This is not, therefore, a review either of Goethe's novel or of this volume. Hence my neutral three-star rating."
4,ACTUAL CONTENTS OF BOX,"I am so happy to finally have a GF grill with removable/interchangeable plates and a temperature control knob!Just a note about the contents of your package: It contains the red grill body, 2 griddle plates (top and bottom), two grill plates (top and draining bottom for tilt position), and one deep bottom plate with sides that they call the baking pan. It also has two drip trays for catching the fat when using the draining grill plate, and two grooved lifters/spatulas. It does not contain the sponge scrubber.I purchased the pack of sponges separately (3/pkg.) and the omelet plate set (top and bottom plates).Cleanup is very easy, especially compared to having the orginal nonremovable surfaces. The temperature knob allows the user to be in control of the cooking process. I really enjoy using this product to prepare simply, tasty, healthy meals."
3,Really good improvements?,"This makes the third George Foreman grill that we have owned. While the removable plates make the grill a more multifunctional item, it does have some drawbacks. One is the storage of all the additional plates when not in use. They do not fit together in any reasonable manner and are more likely to slide around in the cupboard creating a continual nuisance. The top plate for use with the grilling cooking option has a pattern that requires some scrubbing with a brush to get the corners in that pattern clean (I hand wash, someone with a dishwasher will have to comment if that is not a problem for them). I also do not believe that the non-stick surface works as well as previous versions of the grill, so it is good that they are removable so that they can soak. How they will fair with the durability of the surface will be told in time. I was also surprised when reading some of the recipes that they call for the use of a nonstick spray on the grill surface."
4,Love it!,"We absolutely love this thing. I bought one for a gift and liked it so much we bought one for ourselves. However, I was slightly disappointed when I opened this package and realized this version does not come with the omelet plates. You have to pay for them separately so beware!"
3,Not bad,"Got this item. It seems to work pretty well, Wife is not as happy with it as I am. I did notice using it to cook (Chicken, steaks) it seems to cook faster on top than from the bottom. I just cook with it as if i were on the grill. I got the other items to use (omlet, waffle, and other plates) but havent used yet. I REALLY like that you can take out the grill portion to wash without having to submerge the entire applience."
5,Finally...a multipurpose Foreman grill that's easy to clean!,"As an owner of the original Foreman grill, I used it only when absolutely necessary since clean-up was a hassle. With the removable plates, however, clean-up is a breeze -- most of the time the plates can just be cleaned with a quick soap and water rinse and don't even need to go in the dishwasher (although they do fine in there). I also love the idea of interchangeable plates. This grill now replaces my waffle iron, old Foreman grill, and square griddle pan. I also bought the omelet pan, which is unnecessary really, but great for making poached eggs or small omelets (if you want a larger omelet, use the baking pan that comes with the grill and just fold the eggs over). The grill is also nice looking enough that I can leave it out on my counter and store the unused plates in the cabinet beneath. I would give this more than five stars if I could!"
5,Awesome machine,Love the new George Forman grill. The price was right and the delivery was super fast.
5,Like,This is the 3rd Geroge Foreman I have purchase for myself or as a gift. Everyone really enjoys using it. Simple to clean.
2,Surprising!!,"I was in love with this for a couple of months. It weighs a lot. It is hard to store. Once the novelty wore off, I went back to how I normally cook. Fat draining wasn't my problem before I bought. Grey meat was quite unappetizing.I have avoided buying one of these grills for years. After 3 waffle makers, and looking at new ones for the same price as this multi-function grill, I decided to go ahead. Amazing... I really like it. Bacon has never been easier to make. Steaks come out great. Waffles are perfect. I guess it's one of my most successful buys. I do wish it could lie flat so I could make pancakes."
5,Love this grill,"Had the old type of grill and while it seemed sturdier this grill gets the grilling job done and the clean-up is so much easier. Have cooked chicken legs, hamburgers, and steak on it and the product did a wonderful job for me."
4,We love it!!!!,"We love the versitility of the Goerge Foreman. The grandkids love to have waffles everytime they stay over. We do a lot of indoor grilling and it works wonderful. The only thing that we have had trouble with is the griddle for pancakes. We never could get them to brown properly. Other than that it is a wonderful product.J.Rowland Cheyenne, WY"
4,Excellent ....,"So far we have only used it 2-3 times but it does a great job. We have done steak, hamburgers and sandwiches and they all came out really well. It did not do the steak quite as well as my BBQ grill (close though, especially since it was my first time using it), but I didn't have to go outside, start the grill, go back in 10 minutes and put on the steak, then keep going out to check on it. And cleanup is a little more involved than if you cooked in a frying pan, but the plates don't get burned on residue either. Overall we are very satisfied so far, and I am dying to make deep-dish pizza in it."
5,George Foreman GRP,"I love this great amazing grill, its a great grill to own if your looking to loose weight and have healthy meals."
4,Very good product,"We recently ordered this grill to replace our older, smaller Foreman grill. We love it and use it several times a week. The only drawback is the design is a bit bulky in that the handle sticks out a bit more than I thought it would from the picture. However, this grill is so convenient, versatile and easy to clean that we don't mind the extra counter space it takes up."
1,"This grill sucks, but get the GRP99 instead.","I had to return this one because is too small for me and too many plates. But i like the GRP99 grill, it the right size and it has a digital temp control and timer. I only need it for a hamburger, if you use it for more than one purpose, get the RED one."
4,I Must Confess,"I haven't bought this yet, but ONLY because I cannot find out the difference between this one which is red and the GRP90WGP G5 which is the platinum finish. Upon checking the copy on both models which appear here a couple of times, there seems to be a difference in size and color, but outside of that I don't know if there is anything more. Seems both models have plates that are removable and dishwasher safe. I wonder if someone would come to my rescue to explain the differences so I can purchase it. I gave it 4 stars, cause that's what I'm expecting based on all the fabulous reviews actually on both models. Just need to know if one is better than the other. Thanks so much."
3,"Works good, doesn't hold up well","We love to cook with it. The first time I put in the dishwasher (before first use), when I took out some of the plugs covering the screws were missing. Then the screws starting coming loose and the handles fell off. So, I have just resigned myself to hand washing them :(. Otherwise we like the machine."
3,Best of the worst.,"I am not found of the ""G"" grill line, from lack of a attachable/detachable grease catch,non removable grills,meat focus cooking(its to slanted for anything ""runny"") to no timer to no on/off switch makes it appear cheap.The workmanship of the models are ok the heating is so so on some models, this is mostly a rant on some of the specifics of the ""G"" line, for me a timer is a must,the this one rates with most 50+ grills the temp sensor is a nice addition but I'd like a time..if a 30$ micorwave can have one theres no reason a 80+ grill can't have one.Even so this model its temping the multi plates are nice and can even make the Hamilton Beach 25295 grill (or any under 70+ grill) look lacking but again I love my timer because I am a ditz with time, get a timer on his baby and I wont even need a stove anymore!Until it has a timer its 3/5, the Hamilton Beach 25295 is a 4/5, it needs to be bigger!"
4,A little disappointed,"I was so excited to get this grill, to cook for a family of five. I have the original small Foreman Grill, and I love it. We make everything on it from grilled cheese sandwiches to steak, but it takes too long to make 10 hamburgers. So I thought this one would save time. Plus I liked the fact that the plates are removable and interchangeable. My only complaint is that the cord is so short! It's ridiculous! The little grill has such a longer cord, and that takes up less room on the counter. So you are limited to where you can put it. If you have crowded counter space, you need to move the appliance around; but the short cord doesn't allow you to do that. Very annoyed with that design. Plus the top plate doesn't fit flush up against the unit. Feel like it will fall off. Hope it doesn't! Some other people said that it did."
1,Teflon taste in food cooked on this grill,"Based on the great reviews this GF grill had been getting and our experience with the original GF grill we owned, we made the $130 plunge and bought this grill and unfortunately, it has been a big disappointment. We don't use it any more as the food always had a Teflon taste (yes we washed before using). The changeable plates seemed like a great idea, but they do take up a lot of storage as does the GF grill. We had problems with the unit heating unevenly."
5,No-Budget Films at thier best,"This film has nearly no Budget but it pulled me in laughing every second. I went to the premier of this film, then bought the DVD shortly after. Good Flick and its worth it for any B-Movie kinda Guy."
1,ANNOYING HEROINE/Terrible Romance,"The heroine in this novel would definitely fall into the 'too dumb to live' category. Again and again throughout the novel she defies the hero and gets them both into trouble. After the third act of defiance and resulting trouble, I began to skim the book. It was either that or pull my hair out. This book was more about violence and rape rather than romance. The author never showed me the characters falling into love, rather they just did with no apparent reason. The action in the book was much more the focus rather than the relationship."
1,Smaller than you think,"Don't waste you money or your counterspace.This item is something that my wife ""had to have"" for our first baby. We used it for less than a month before it went back in the box. We use the wide mouth Avent bottles, and the rack doesn't hold more than six bottles. The wide mouth bottles also had a tendancy to fall off the holders and roll into the sink. It wasn't long before we packed it up and just started putting the bottles in the dishrack with the dishes."
3,"Great in theory, doesn't fit Avent bottles well","I love the idea of this, but I can only keep 6 Avent bottles in it at a time. We handwash our bottles and were planning on using this for drying and storage but it didn't work out."
5,Love this rack,"This bottle drying rack is wonderful. It really holds are good amount of bottles. Plus it keeps everything all organized. That is important since tiny parts are easy to loose. I love that I can hang dry my bottles and the nipples. I didn't like having to put them on a towel to dry because I was constantly using towels (kitchen germs) and the counter was always wet. This saves me laundry time and wet counters. It was inexpensive, easy to put together, and is easy and convenient to use."
4,"GOOD DRYING RACK/ORGANIZER, HOWEVER, BOTTLE BRUSH TOO SMALL!","I registered for this rack/organizer and I am very glad I received it as a gift. Up until now, I only use VentAire bottles (both 8-Oz and 6-Oz) and this rack holds up 8 of them at a time with no problem. I just stack up the nipple attachments on the side compartment. The angled base is a great feature, however it is not useful if your sink has a lifted edge, like mine. But that's not too much of a problem, I just drain it myself. It comes with a bottle brush, but the brush is too small to clean the VentAire bottles properly, so I just use another bottle brush."
3,Wish I'd realized I could use the sterilizer stand for this,"We got one of these....and also a microwave sterilizer. This was a fine product in itself, but in the end we learned that you could just pull the stand from the microwave sterilizer out and leave it on the counter for the bottles etc. to dry. Thus the drier was unnecessary."
4,GOOD LITTLE RACK,"I use this for drying bottle parts, baby spoons, etc... (nothing too large) and it works great. It takes up very little space on the counter, unlike a regular dish rack and it also come with a double ended bottle brush which fits into it's own spot on the rack for storing. The only thing i don't like about this is that the ""arms"" that hold the bottles up fold down too easily. (they can be folded down to accomodate different sized items in the rack, but tend to fall over if the item is too heavy). But even with that minor problem, I'm extremely glad I bought it since it's helped to clean up the clutter of drying bottle parts on my counter top."
5,"Great, True Original, Fast Delivery to Singapore!!","Definitely will buy again in the future from this seller, good original product, good price, and fast delivery.The price shown is far cheaper than the exhibition price, and it's really worthed to buy,especially when the things can be shipped to Singapore!Thanks a lot!"
5,Best bib for tots!,"This is such a great bib for your little one. Super easy to clean, durable, and I love the ""crumb catcher"" as it keeps the bits off of baby! Its great because you can wipe it down or submerge it it water if you need to for cleaning. I only wish it came in more colors!"
3,Didn't work for my son,"I think you have to start them off with this type of bib. My 8 month old son had gotten used to the lighter weight of fabric nylon bibs, so he found the weight of this bib very distracting. He yanks it off in irritation EVERY time we put it on him...nearly strangling himself in the process. I will hang onto them to try on our next baby, as I had high hopes for this product. We shall see..."
1,Kids hate them!,We have twins and they go crazy when we try to put these on them! They try to rip the bib off and burst into tears.The bibs limit their movement and they can't move around as much as they can with soft bibs.
4,low maintenance,"As expected, it was very easy to clean, and reuse. Cup worked great to keep food from scattering. Not uncomfortable for the baby. Only minor complaint is that it staind easily. Other than that, definitely my favorite bib."
5,If You Only Buy One Set of Bibs,"If you only buy one set of bibs, this should be the one. After all, they never have to be laundered, and the pockets are great for catching wayward items. Also, unlike many plastic lined bibs, this one is made Entirely of plastic; no cloth edging for me. Finally, the trough-like front allows me to drop cereal in it for times when my hands are not clean and he's snacking on the go.Three things to add: (1) If your child has long hair, it can get caught in the clasp unless you lift it out of the way (common sense). (2) Also, not very fold-able for traveling. For the diaper bag/cooler, I highly recommend the Bibbity Rinse and Roll Bib by Kiddopotamus. Between these two brands, I need no other. (3) I was given the Baby Bjorn bibs by a friend whose two-year old refused to wear them. My son was 10 months at the time and didn't notice a change in bib style. Perhaps introducing the bib to a toddler with a favorite cereal pre-loaded in the ""trough"" would be more effective."
4,no mess,"I have started using this with my toddler and it is very helpful cleaning up the food crumbs he had made. I bought two, one is always in his bag that I use when we eat out and the other at home. We will not go out without it. Easy to clean even with liquids."
2,Mask,It's a good mask but I don't not recommend for children it's way to big and when I tried to put it Around my head the string popped and didn't fit my head.
4,very easy to follow video,"This is a really well put together video. I am a extreme beginner with bellydancing, and this video helped me to get some of the basic moves down. The best part of the tape, in my opinion, was that it always showed her whole body while she danced. With a lot of workout or instructional dance videos you get a lot of close ups of the teacher's face. For me, it is very difficult to get the moves without seeing the legs, arms and feet do the whole thing. It is not terribly high intensity workout, but you do work up a sweat, and the tape goes by very quickly. Almost 40 minutes goes by before you know it."
4,Very good,"The Olympus pearlcorder is exactly the type of recorder I wanted. I have used one before, but misplaced it, so I bought another one. I am glad it is still being made. I use it mostly to record my piano pieces so that I may hear my nuances and correct them such as hitting a chord too loudly when it calls for soft, etc.Thank you"
4,Great sound quality and affordable price,"This microcassette recorder is very simple to use and the recording quality is much better than I expected. It's very lightweight and portable. The 2 AA batteries it uses last a long time. If the sound quality starts to go down, it's probably because the batteries need replacement. The one problem I have is that the 'out' ear connection hole is too small for both my ear bud set and headphone set. I usually don't use these with the recorder so it's not a big issue for me, but if you're someone who plans to use headphones with it, just be aware that not all headphones or ear buds will fit. Other than that, I'm extremely happy with the quality of this recorder, the ease of use and the great price."
1,I would not buy another one,The recorder I got was not clear and had a static. It came highly recommended by a friend so I know it is a good product. I just think that I may have got a lemon which can happen with any product. I would not want to encourage of discourage anyone from buying one.
3,"Hard find, great piece","This book is nearly impossible to find, but those who manage to grab a copy won't be disappointed. Told in the first person as an autobiography, this text walks us through an entire different culture of baseball than anyone in the US is familiar with. We fight and argue about home run records here, but this book is written by a man none of our athletes even come close to rivaling!IF you can find a copy of this book you won't be disappointed!"
4,amzingly good!,"i watched all the episodes and i enjoyed them. this tvseries is really good, the cast, fighting scenes, the script i loved it. still one of my favorites wuxia series."
2,Not for me,"This case is too large for general carrying of a DVD player. There were too many velcro straps included without instructions or ideas on how to use them. Pictures were on the package, however I couldn't figure most of them out."
3,disappointing,Mr. Drury lists some of the better known shamans. I agree with him completely in regards to Carlos Castaneda.Mr. Drury lists some Shamanic principles.Mr Drury lsts some of the various plants used by Shamans.This book does not provide enough information to assist you in becoming a shamanic practitioner. Read my other reviews to se the various Shamanic books I recommend.
3,Good Enough,"I caught this movie at the local art-house about a year ago, and got wrapped up in it. I haven't read the book so I can't compare the two. I thought this was an intelligent and entertaining movie. It has a good ending - not sure if it's a happy ending or not. There were only a few times I found scenes to be a little on the long side - like when the doctor is trying to get the boys' counselor to admit what he did (I won't spoil it here) but I thought the doctor was great and I was rooting for him all the way to the end. If you are looking for more of a simple movie, you will probably like this one. No computer generation, no special effects - just good old-fashioned storytelling."
2,My opinion,"This VHS of The Road to Wealth is an abridged version, and is missing key information that is written in book form. Information in the book has many stories and examples of how to do a better job of creating a better financial future. It is also a good reference."
1,Simplistic & where is the beef!,There are much better sources of investment information than Suze. Try the Motley Fools or anyone.
1,"Strauss: The Magic of Vienna, by Madacy Entertainment Group,","A one-star rating is still too high for this recording. The recording is the worst, beyond one's imagination. Vienna is such a beautiful and majestic city, and Johann Strauss' waltz music is always most enchanting. But this recording, with its obviously cheap budget, poor aesthetic taste, and impossibly bad photography, should not be placed in market."
2,"Single insight, otherwise whiny","The author has an important insight that customers judge businesses by the small details that sometimes go awry and that negative impressions can overwhelm positives. But there are few new ideas about service quality in this tedious work. The author vents about McDonald's for its product offering and service, yet the fast food giant keeps rocking along and earns record profits. We should all be so awful."
2,"product was good, show was meh","Quality and speed of acquired video was good.The t.v. show was okay, but didn't really leave me wanting more."
5,"Great Show, Glad I found it!","I had not heard much about this show and happened upon a trailer on youtube. I decided to give it a try and I am really glad I did. The show follows an Irish cop in 1864 New York. The acting and writing is really good. It is a fun twist on the morally ambiguous cop drama. The main character is really great and one of TV's most likeable in my opinion. The show to me, also has a distinctive western feel perhaps just because of the time period. I have only watched the first two episodes, but ordered the rest and can't wait to finish! I think fans of shows like Justified and The Shield may enjoy this as well. Great work on the part of BBC America for picking this up as their first original scripted drama."
4,Wish I had BBC America on my cable lineup,This was an enjoyable show that showed the grit of early America. I don't think any of the major US networks would produce something like this and I recommend it.
2,Boring,"We looked forward to this show with great anticipation. After 3 episodes it became repetitive. The show did not seem to get beyond the shock of having a little girl want to be a prostitute. Nothing interesting about showing a little girl in the sex trade. There was not any spark between the characters, nor great acting. We could predict every plot line. We stopped purchasing the episodes."
4,"The 'visual' companion piece to the book, ""How The Irish Became White"" .","I watched the first season after buying COPPER just by reading the premise. This is the bridge of information, history and American cultural progress, given short shrift by the movies like ""Far And Away"" which although a great movie, neglects much more than it exposes about the Irish/Black experience in the Northeast. Read, ""How the Irish Became White"" and watch COPPER in that context and see how much riskier COPPER is in it's portrayal and though ""stylized"" starts to deal with the history of America similar to the book. I only hope the story line does not degrade into ""molasses"", why does the BBC produce culturally relevant shows while American TV gives us 25 versions of CSI and Law And Order? Cannot wait for Seasons 2-10..."
3,It is ok - I just had a different idea of what it would be,"I think this series would appeal to many, it just wasn't what I was expecting. The series focuses more on how lawless people are and I would have liked to have seen more of a blend of the good, bad, poor and society people."
5,COPPER ROCKS,"I think this is a wonderful new show! I'm glad it comes on right after one of my favorite shows ""Hell on Wheels"". I think they did an awesome job with this new show and I hope it keeps running!"
4,Good Show-interesting plot twists,"The show is not afraid to veer off into unexpected territory and characters are often capable of behavior that is unexpected but not jarringly different than their persona, just not the direction dramas like this usually heads. The setting and time frame are not often explored, so it makes it seem more interesting and harder to drop into cliches."
3,8MM Edible Pearls,"Overall, I was satisfied with this product. I ordered this for my daughter's birthday cake. They are a nice size, and they were shipped quickly and with no packaging or shipping issues. My only disapointment is, they have no shimmer to them. They are very matte and not very pretty. Very plastic looking."
4,Good Space Opera - great science topics,"Vital part of Anderson's future history (early on, before the empire that Dominic Flandry defended even existed), when Nick van Rijn's traders discovered a rogue world that was approaching a sun close enough to get warmed up. The notion of brown bodies was new in the 1960's when this was written, and the human battles over this freak of nature was as good as anything Anderson has ever written. His desciption of what was going on as the planet warmed up were great as well."
2,Tsubaki Cam chain BS05M-106,"Bought this chain for my shorttrack bike. I looked and then measured. I have purchase Tsubaki chain for my 500's in the past and this chain looks to be lighter duty with contour cut side plates (Figure 8) vs. oval plates (more meat). I have real doubts about this chain being adequate for race use. The chain otherwise appears to be of Japanese origin, is properly sized and manufactured. I would feel a better if there was comparison data available to review. This chain vs. the DID chain # 219FTSS-106. I can find data for the DID chain, but nothing for Tsubaki.If you're a racer use at your own risk, probably OK for stock.pcnsd"
4,an excellent Disney movie for any age,"Great 'old time' Disney movie, good for all ages. The Black Cauldron is a movie that is sometimes forgotten but it shouldn't be. Personally I think this should be in any Disney Buff's DVD collection.Dawn"
2,This Lost Classic.................,"...should have stayed lost.Sorry Disney fans. I saw this at Radio City Hall many, many years ago during its premiere week. What a disappointment. While the animation was somewhat interesting, it failed to live up to its hype. Instead, the movie consisted of very loud rumbles, crashes, special effects. The characters were one-dimensional lacking any warmth or depth. Disney could have spent a little less on special effects and hired a screenwriter.It gets 2 stars rather than 1 star only because it served as a prototype (only with respect to special effects) to Disney's renaissance animation (Little Mermaid, Beauty & the Beast, et. al.)."
2,A weak showing.,"I loved the Lloyd Alexander books as a kid, and when this move came to the theaters I begged to go. (Yeah, I'm that old) The movie is too cutsie in some parts, and dark in others. The two differing directions take a lot away from the movie. Its almost as if two different directors where trying to make two different versions of the movie, and then in the end it just got spliced together."
1,A horrible movie (I give is -5 stars),"I was excited to see this movie after having read the books. Not only is this movie one of the worst cartoons I have ever seen, but it is a sacralige that it is associated in any way with Lloyd Alexander's wonderful books. The story does not relate to anything in the books and I found the movie quite offensive and lewd at times. This movie goes at the top of my 'Never ever ever see list'."
2,disappointing flick compared to the BOOKS!,"This is a so-so movie that, sadly, is all many people know of Lloyd Alexander's wonderful Chronicles of Prydain. It's Disney, but it lacks the ""charm"" of earlier Disney flicks as well as the ""polish"" of ones to come only a few years later.I'd only pick this up for Alexander fans or people who want to own *every* Disney movie...but, regardless, READ THE BOOKS- they are wonderful!"
3,They need to make a live action version!,"Okay, so the Disney version of The Black Cauldron isn't exactly like the book. Disney left out LOTS of characters and rather stupidly cut parts out of the personalities of certain characters (read: Eilonwy and Fflewddur). However, if you have never read the book, you will definitely enjoy the movie. The story is basically about a young boy who goes on a quest to find an oracular pig and a magical cauldron that must be destroyed, or else the country of Prydain will be in mortal danger. On the way, our hero meets several companions who help him on his journey. The animation was good in this film, but no animated movie can fully capture the essence of Lloyd Alexander's book series. I think that Disney seriously needs to make a live-action movie of TBC and maybe another for The High King. If anyone reading this agrees with me, I'd love to hear from you! Eventually I want to form a petition to send to Disney, but I need your help!"
5,Great film,My Children really loved this film. It was a great movie and I would recommend it to anyone that is a Disney fan! They make good movies that Children really enjoy!
1,It deserves minus 5 stars!!!!!!!,"This movie should be erased from the disney collection. It was a horrible translation of the charming book by Lloyd Alexander. No person who read the book could ever like this movie. It was an attempt to mix the whole series of ""The Book of Three"" that went horribly wrong as any movie would when you try and mess with such a wonderful classic. It left out wonderfull characters and basicaly the whole story line. Disney needs to take this one back and try again or jsut leave it alone. There's a bad apple in every buch but disney sure turned out a rotten one."
2,ONE OF THE WORST DISNEY MOVIES,"This is a rancid excuse for a disney movie{Considering no one, including my parents have ever hear of it}. Disney changed everything around, not living up to the Chronicles of Pridain books at all. And this movie is rated PG???? Could've been alot better."
3,A good bad-luck story,"Eugene expects the worst and usually gets it, even when he wins an all-expenses trip to Bermuda. This picture book follows Eugene as he is shipwrecked on an (almost) deserted island. Eugene's luck changes when he runs into a parrot with some unusual talents. An amusing tale for adults as well as children. This seemingly simple picture book has been highly lauded by book reviewers, librarians, and other children's book experts; I have to admit that while I enjoyed the book, I don't quite understand why it's been so highly lauded. Take a look for yourself and decide... 2006 ALA Notable Book"
2,Ball Stomper,"This did not throw the balls as far as I thought it would. But, my son did have fun playing with it in the pool."
4,Fantastic! A must see for anyone using a Mac or Wintel Pc.,"This is the history of computers condensed. You get a good grasp of what happened between Microsoft and Apple. Bill Gates and Steve Jobs are interviewed. Key players at Xerox and Ibm are also interviewed. This is a very informative documentary but lacks, the personal story telling appeal of the Pirates of Silicon Valley (a must have vhs tape that dramaticizes this documentary). This Dvd pretty much explains how it is we came to using mice and file folders and pictures instead of boring command line text entries. It's a great documentary. Buy it. You won't be disappointed."
5,History of the Software Industry,"This is the essential watch for any IT bod it tells of how this industry was born. I watched this on channel 4 London in 1996 and it inspired me to believe bigger and better things and made me tenacious enough to stick this industry, and a warning to those who take it for granted.I decided to buy this for posterity, but getting this dvd has been a problemPurchasing this dvd meant there was a whopping 13 VAT which made this more expensive and this is region 1 which didnt work on my DVD playerto get this working find a media player codec on cnet this works well with real player on your computer."
3,"A history of Apple, IBM, and Microsoft. Nothing more.","Robert X. Cringely (aka Mark Stephens) is a self admitted Apple revisionist who not only loves to vilify Microsoft, but often overlooks the contributions of companies like Commodore, Atari, RadioShack, and Texas Instruments. Don't kid yourself -- these were major players, too.That's not to say Cringely doesn't deserve kudos for his contributions to computer journalism. But one should approach his works with an open mind (i.e. open to sources aside from him), and a well-tuned B.S. meter."
1,This book is an affront to ANY parent or pre-teen!,"Although the material is cloaked in conservative Christian words, only the most narrow-minded Christian could agree with the author's outlandish ""commandments"" disguised as ""God's Word"". As a Christian, I was very offended for the author to claim to be THE intrepeter of God's word.The information presented is very minimalistic, concerning itself only with the basic conception and birth process. The author's only attempts to address children's questions about sexual feelings, masturbation, homosexuality, etc. is a simplistic ""I (the author, speaking for God) say it is a sin.""The author, quite forcefully, attempts to replace parental responsibility of instilling morality in children, with preaching his own views, evangilizing that to not follow his views is sinful and punishable by eternal damnation. He even goes so far as to mock the Supreme Court of the United States!Highly recommended to avoid!"
1,The 9 Steps to Financial Freedom:Practical & Spiritual Steps,This book -- 3 inches by 3 inches -- is just a joke. I could not believe a version of this book is selling. I bought this book with the hope it was like the regular book since I have seen the reviews of it and maybe did not pay much attention to the details of the book on the internet at the time of purchase. It is impossible to conceive that Suze Orman would publish a book like this to deceive people into buying it to make money. The outside and cover looks like the real book but the content just had an outline of the 9 steps. I was disappointed when I received the book.
2,At least she doesn't hide her views.,"First of all, there's no reason in the world to buy a book like this. Your library will have it or something comparable. Now, a warning. This book was written by a woman who believes that money is the most important thing in life. I'm not making that up. In fact, those are practically her exact words (see the introduction). So if you just want to be the next ignorant SUV-driving capitalist, this may be the book for you. If, however, you view financial security as more of a necessary evil than one of the joys of life, pass on this book and go consult an officer at your bank branch. That way you'll save up something far more valuable than money: time, which can be used to read truly worthwhile books."
3,Open your mind,"After reading the book and many of the reviews, I have to agree that, while this book may not fit everyone's needs, it serves an important purpose. It encourages people to begin looking at the way they think of and deal with money. It's interesting how some reviewers became angrily adamant about the uselessness of the book while others praised it as if it were the gospel. I'd say those with a moderate opinion are right; it is uplifting, motivational, and thought-provoking, but you may need to look elsewhere for further improvements and knowledge about finances."
4,Great starter book,"It's very good for beginners in the world of family finances. It gave me loads of practical information and good advice. It made me prioritize our family spending. It made me be in touch with our money, when most people don't even like to think about it. I still have a long way to go to become financially free, but it suerly was a good start!"
3,Requires introspection,"Suze Orman made me contemplate my own money psyche. I didn't even know that I had one before I started reading the book! However, I was hoping for more nuts and bolts on personal finance. Happily, I recently stumbled across a sleeper that provided just that. The name of the book is ""The Unofficial Guide to Investing,"" which was released this year. It's a fun read and very informative."
5,Beyond Expectations,"This is the best motivational book I've listened to in years! I'd seen Suzy on PBS and expected pleasant listening, but nothing to this level! Suzy addressed so many topics and caused me to think and evaluate my priorities. As a recent retiree, I now FULLY understand the value of financial planning while young! Had I listened to this prior to making my retirement choices, I may well have opted for ""nursing home"" insurance while it was available to me (Did you know that one out of three people who have nursing home insurance will use it?). When she talked about wills, I thought, ""yea, that's right, I need to write my medical wishes and get to my lawyer."" My advice is, ""Buy it! Listen to it! Give it to your kids to listen to!"" IT IS TERRIFIC!"
4,Finally a Woman to Woman guide to financial freedom you can really use,"Easy read with very little technical gargon, she defines things well.Suze brings the ""high finance"" down to earth and inspires and motivates. I have used all of her 9 Steps and they are truely steps up the financial staircase. She takes the fear out of finance."
3,Promising so far,"I just got this book and I must say I think it looks very promising. I felt I had to write a review, seeing how I disagree with the only other review written here.I am a beginner and I think the book has a easy-to-understand approach. Also, the cd with the book contains a lot of trial versions, among other things flash5, which I can't wait to test out. (and yes, I checked: all the things that are supposed to be on the cd are there... :) )So all in all.. this looks very good so far."
2,Bait and Switch,"I live near the Appalachian Trail and was looking forward to this book's descriptive treatment of this rare American trasure.Instead, we get only a sliver of information about it, and tons of ho-hum plot about hiding an armored car in a barn.Barns in this nexk of the woods are not often used for that purpose, so the realism of the book is questionable from the start.Anyway, I would not recommend it much."
4,"Very, Very good. Nosferatu still better.","If you have Nosferatu, get this. You will thank yourself later. An excellent Classically inspired speed metal band of unmatching fury and skill. Nosferatu, i feel, is a better album, but this one is a VERY close second. If your a fan of Helstar, get this ... it's a must have. If you never had a Helstar CD, i would recommend Nosferatu first, then this one. I think Nosferatu is a little more polished. Distant Thuder still rocks completely, so don't get me wrong. I just had to give it 4 stars because i feel Nosferatu is PERFECTION! Distant Thunder still kicks immense explitive! Enjoy!"
4,surprising value,"I bought these as an extra for the player we have in our van. We make a 2500 mile round trip at least once a year and my husband and I like to listen to the books on tape while the kids are watching movies. Our kids are 1,3,5 so I wasn't really expecting these to last more than a trip or two for the price. They are surprisingly sturdy, more so than the Rosens that came with the system. The sound quality is great for the kids and they fit them better than the other earphones. The only thing that may be a problem is that there is a part on the ear piece that snaps off and the kids liked to play with it at first, but it easily snaps back on without affecting performance. Overall I am extremely happy with this product."
2,Misleading Title,"Should be ""Introduction to Excel using Finance Examples"" At an introductory level, the Excel coverage is OK. But the finance component is extremely shallow. The authors need to team up with someone who knows finance. Those who seriously want to learn what this text wanted to offer should try ""Financial Modeling Using Excel and VBA"" (Wiley Finance)by Chandan Sengupta."
3,Insufficient Finance Explanations,"I wanted to learn about principals of finance such as depreciation etc...this book is NOT for that. It assumes you know a good bit about finance, but have never heard of Excel...not a likely scenario."
2,Worth a look.,"2 stars is misleading. I would recommend this to anyone interested in Becket. To see a directors interpretation of his work provided invaluable insights into both the works themselves, and the process of directing film.That being said, I was not amazed. The potential of a four disk DVD and large booklet, exclusively Becket, was unlimited. The product was a half-dozen enjoyable plays, and not even a documentary on Becket. In their great humility, they made a documentary, about themselves, making the DVD you are about to purchase. Great."
2,Not for Hamsters,This cage is not for the regular size hamster at all. This cage is meant for mice. My hamster cannot slide down the slide or fit in the nesting space.
3,ok,This is an okay product. I got a better quality lens cloth from my eye doctor. This lens cloth is not as soft & does not clean as well as the one from my dr office.
4,Not very soft.,"Effective wiper. Nothing wrong with it. Carrying case was ineffectual, lost it promptly. The wipe itself is less soft than you might expect, but otherwise wipes fine, left no scratches or anything of the sort. Handy to have."
5,Excellent. Will reorder.,"Best cloth for my progressive lens. Seriously crystal clear, like I'm not wearing glasses. I will definitely order more cloths for my extra pair of glasses."
5,Good CD,"This CD is kinda weird to hear for the first few times, but once you get used to the Japanese singing, it makes it that much better. It's a great CD."
3,"Good, But Incomplete","I enjoyed this book, but was somewhat dismayed by lack of introductory material. For example, who is the Malcolm of the title? Malcolm X? Malcolm McDowell? It was only once I checked the customer reviews at Amazon.com that I learned it's Malcolm Muggeridge. Also, where are Muggeridge's replies to Lewis' letters? However brilliant it may be, it's difficult to put Lewis' correspondence into context without reading the other side of the discussion."
4,Can't get too much Tape,"I saw this movie on the Keene State College campus, and being a film major I can be very critical on movies. I thought this film to be very clever. There are only three characters, the film is done in real time (meaning one minute = one minute), and the camera never leaves the motel room that the story takes place in.Ethan Hawke is a 28 yr old drug dealer and volunteer fire fighter, and is meeting his friend in a small town to view his friend's Independant film the following day. Ethan tape records his friend admitting that he had raped Emu Thurman's character a decade earlier. Ethan then calls and invites Emu to the motel room and the conflicts continue to rise until a decision has to be made, friendship or freedom?"
3,I wonder what hotel that was!,"First off, I don' rate any movies five. Second, this wouldn't be a 3 but somewhere in between a 3 and 4. This movie mightily kicked booty. Who would have ever thought lying, rape and snorting coke could get anyone into trouble? Let me tell you that Uma Thurman was sick in this movie. She undoubtedly stole the show, because, in essence, this was a show that just happened to be made into a movie. I would rate this movie over any oscar nominated films of that year like A Beautiful mind, even if math musicians smoke cigarettes and are ripped and yet still get to shag beautiful women. Watch this movie. Than watch Waking Life. Don't watch Dazed N Confused. It sucked."
3,"Good for storage, not for feeding a breastfed baby","This is a good set to buy if you have a Medela breastpump and need some extra bottles to pump into. However I am perplexed at why they call this a 'breastmilk feeding system', when the bottles/nipples do not seem to be designed at all with a breastfeeding infant in mind. The nipples are the orthodontic shape - no woman has nipples shaped like that! There also is no design to the bottles to control the amount of air, and no nipple features to make the milk flow more slowly. The milk comes out very quickly and my baby would always cough and choke. We use these bottles for pumping and storage only; bottles like Dr. Brown's are much better for feeding."
1,"The Lids and Nipples LEAK constantly, DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY","I bought a Medela pump (love it!) and some bottles came with it. I also bought an extra set of bottles. It was a complete waste of money. I am telling you - these bottles leak out of the top between the o-shaped lid and the nipple. DO NOT BUY THEM! If you're concerned about freezer storage, just buy the Medela pump and save bags, they work great. For pumping, you can attach almost any bottle and store those in the fridge. Seriously, this is such a hassle. You can't take these bottles anywhere without spilling all over and you don't want to mess with them at 3 a.m. when they're dumping milk all over you child, trust me!"
5,The Best Nipple for Breasfeeding,"My son had a very difficult time with a bottle. On the day I went back to work I called the nurse at my doctor's office and she suggested trying these ones. I had the set and thought the nipple flow was too fast so I did not try it. I called my father in law who was at my house with my mother in law. He pulled the nipple out of the drawer, sterilized and my son immediately took to it. We tried every other nipple for three weeks and he could not latch on to it properly. He latches on to this similar to how he latches on to the breast, they work like a charm. The bottles are also a great size. I will recommend these to everyone who breastfeeds."
2,If you need more bottles to store milk it is a waste of mone,I bought these for I needed more bottles to store freezer breastmilk. If you are going to use them also for feeding I found the nipples to flow to quickly for my little one. I used a different bottle for feeding and wish I would have gotten nestmom.com website before purchasing as I got their mother milkmate storage system for 27.00. It includes 10 5oz bottles and a handy rack for the freezer keeping oldest milk in front. The 27 also includes shipping - The bottles fit on both medela and ameda breast pumps. It is well worth the money and wish I hadn't bought the medela bottles as they are no longer being used.
3,"Product is fine, price is too high","If all you want is something to pump into and/or store breastmilk in, this won't let you down - but you can get many more bottles for your money going with the 4oz evenflo or gerber bottles, both of which come in BPA free versions. (The colored plastic evenflo are BPA free, not the clear plastic ones) Both brands will screw onto Medela pump hardware and are light enough to do hands-free pumping."
1,Horrible-my baby choked during her feeding,"These are a complete waste of money. The nipples flow too fast for a newborn. I tried using them many times during my return to work transition and my daughter choked and cried during each feeding. She also swallowed so much air-I was burping her for what seemed hours. The bottles are too expensive for just storage-you can purchase generic breastmilk storage bottles made by evenflow for $3.99...personally I like to use the storage bags laid flat in my freezer, they take up less space."
2,Not necessary,"Don't bother with these. They are expensive for only 4 bottles and totally unnecessary. It is much easier to buy storage bags. If you are pumping full time, you will be storing alot more than 4 bottles at a time. I also found that I did not like these bottles for feeding because they do nothing to prevent air from entering baby's belly and the result is gas or worse, colic.They also flow too fast for newborns."
5,The title tells no lies,Definitively it's the javascript bible.If you want to fine tune your AJAX apps you'd better buy this book.It's extensive object and fuction reference does not leave anything in the shadows.This book is worth every cent.
1,"FULL OF OUTDATED & WRONG INFO -DON""T BUY!","As a parent of a child with Tourette's, I feel I must warn anyone trying to learn about TS to ABSOLUTELY NOT buy this horrifying book. It is full of completely outdated and flat out wrong information that has long since been dismissed by current clinical studies. Please skip it and go read Brad Cohen's book"
5,"Good product, good price","This is a good solid product at a fair price. Hard to find or impossible to find in stores in my area, but the on line service and home delivery in a timely fashion were just what the doctor ordered."
3,Too much Drama,Too much DRAMA for one person in one life time if it wasn't one thing it was another. Overall the book was OK. It was definitely a page turner but after a while you have to say when will all this DRAMA stop? Enough is enough already. Right when you think it over its keeps going and going and going even in the end it kept going and going. Not sure if I would want to read a sequel if it happens to be one. What more can one endure in a life time.
4,Ladies Get Your Game Up,"This book was cool; I could identify with parts of the story. I will wait eagerly for the sequel.""A lady has spoken""-Ladyofgrace2003"
5,Good Book!,The item arrived on time and came in fairly good condtion for a used book. There were no pages missing and everything was caefully intacted.
3,"Disappointing after ""Fast Food Nation""","After bring impressed with ""Fast Food Nation,"" I began ""Reefer Madness"" with high expectations which simply were not met. While the book is reasonably well-researched, there is simply too much preaching. The obvious biases of the author in all three essays (!) brings the accuracy of his hard data into question. The writing style is rather dry, which makes a strange climate for the sensationalism of Schlosser's claims. This book is neither as objective, nor as well-researched (there are more field anecdotes and narrative history than hard numbers), nor as interesting as ""Fast Food Nation."" What a shame."
1,Too Disorganized,I found this book to be incredibly disorganized and scattered. It might have worked better as a series of essays without a single theme since there really isn't a straight narrative theme to be found in this work. I was disappointed after reading his earlier work.
4,Another Great Work By Schlosser,"With Reefer Madness, Eric Schlosser provides us with another extraordinary piece of reporting. This work is well documented (a large number of pages are deveoted to notes and references) and is a compelling, hard to put down read. Perhaps the most important theme that unifies the three essays in this book is how the US Government manipulates the moral and legal arguments for or against an issue (legalizing marijuana or cheap farm labor, for example) in order to meet its needs or agenda. An eye opening look at three underground industries and at our own dishonest policymakers."
3,Ear piece doesn't fit well.,"I have been through many headsets through the years. The boom mic is decent, but the ear piece doesn't really fit well."
3,Nice but does not work for changing watch bands,I agree that this is a quality product. I also like the portability. But the reason I only give it three stars is that the flat head bits that come with it are not small enough to change the watch band on my watches.
4,Good and entertaining but missing ending,it was all cool when goku turned super saiyan and was beating frezia pretty bad. It was all great until I got to the end of the book and frezia was still alive!! I had to read volume 12 to see the end of frezia. That cost me another 7.95.
5,VERY SATISFIED.,"Quick delivery. Pump works great. Pump was described as stated in the add. I'll do business again. Amazon, you're the best.Thank you."
3,Runs small,This hoodie does not run true to size. I had to go up a size to get the right length in the arms and stomach area. Other than that its soft and doesn't feel cheaply made. Asking price is a bit much for a generic hoodie but Prime can make up for that a bit.
5,Powerful Impact,"What a strong, motivating and inspiring book. This book draws historical wisdom and ancient truth as foundation principles. Upon that foundation, Tillman's practical application and real life insight make the material come alive. In this time of crisis management and leadership on the run, SCORING IN THE RED ZONE is a powerful impacter.Jeff D.

3,Useful but pills,"I liked the size of these pads that is near perfect for a newborn. I use them on changing table and on our bed when I bring my baby for a cuddle.I washed them the first time before using it and it seemed fine, but subsequently after a second wash, it pilled badly. I still use it, but put a soft towel ontop of it. I still carry one of these in my diaper bag and really like the convienience of the size and weight. I only wish it did not pill as much."
2,Split apart,"The layers of my pad literally split apart, and since I live overseas now, I think I'll splurge for the more expensive Carter's pad for baby #2, since I can't just walk into the store to return it! It also pilled and was ugly, but it does a good job, even better than the (non-quilted variety) absorbent lap pads, which if your li'l one pees on the table, will run everywhere until it is absorbed. These work faster!"
3,"Serves purpose, doesn't hold up well","These pads are very absorbent and certainly serve the purpose, but they don't look very good after you wash them. For the price I suppose you can't expect much, but the Carter's lap pads wash much better. If you are going to get some, use them under things and buy the white ones. The colors seem to show the pilling more. I use them under the bassinett sheet now. I used to use them on top of the changing pad, but my baby is only 2 months old and they already look quite old."
3,Stains,It is very handy but it stains easily and the stains are impossible to get out because of the material it is made of. I would suggest another alternative.
1,Save Your Money,"Once you wash this, it pills horribly. The pilling is so bad, that I don't deem it safe to lay my son on top of the pad for fear that he'll ingest the tufts of fiber. Not to mention that it looks pretty shabby, too. I was only able to use these for a few weeks, under my bassinet sheet."
4,Worth the Money,"I have purchased a few of these. They are versatile and I love them. I use one on my changing table, I keep one in the bedroom for when I need to change my baby in there. Once I go back to work, I will have one for my mother's house. This pad keeps whereever you use this dry. My only complaint is that after a few times in the wash, it starts getting the fuzzies! But why complain - for the price, its worth it."
5,My Favorite Play!,"This play is amazing, crazy and oh so funny. It's fun to read and even better to watch!"
5,Best Book for Your Muffin Needs,"I checked this book out of the library and had to have it! It's wonderful -- it gives a basic muffin recipe that you can add to, and then many many wonderful recipes such as oatmeal banana. She tells you how to adjust the recipes for your taste (can you use egg whites instead of eggs to make the muffin even lighter? yes, but they won't brown as well). This is also a wonderful gift to give, in a basket with some muffins made from the book's recipes!"
5,A Dude in Los Angeles,"As an undergraduate at Rutgers College, Rutgers University (1987), I was a Henry Rutgers Honors scholar and wrote a thesis entitled ""Linguistic Conflict in Spain."" This book was invaluable to me in my research to bridge pre-Civil War Spain and democracy's foothold in this Iberian constitutional monarchy post-Franco. It's excellent. Any Hispanophile needs this in their bibliotheque."
1,Waste of paper,"This book starts out by stating it is an unbiased historical account of our presidents based on surveys. But in the forward within a few pages you hear that Bill Clinton is a 'pathological liar' and that George W. Bush, a war time president, is headed for greater things. If you are going to spew right wing propaganda at least try and hide it a 'little' bit, or should I say thank you for letting me know ASAP not to waste any more time reading this book?"
5,Subtitle: A Bathroom Reader,"I know it sounds like a left-handded complement, but this is an absolutely perfect book for the bathroom. I'm sure many will get all hung up on the rankings and say X should be ahead of Y, but the authors do a wonderful job of encapsulating each presidency into an essay that hits all of the highlights and lowlight, and explains the historical context in which they were set. Furthermore, each essay can be read in the amount of time it takes to make an average crap. It is the perfect read for those who weren't interested in history during high school or college, but are now."
4,A Great Overview of Presidential History,This is a good book for anyone wanting a nice way to get familiar with our former presidents while only having to read just a few pages of material each. I just wish the book was better referenced for the parts I would like to get more information about.
3,Substituted a major pain for a lesser pain,"I bought this cushion to get some relief from sacroiliitis in driving two hour intervals. The cushion is really too wide to properly fit the flat bottom part of my car's U-shaped bucket seat, so the sides of the cushion rise up and put pressure on the back of my thighs. This becomes moderately painful after about 30 minutes, but the pain is tolerable. I do get relief with the cushion from the much more severe pain previously experienced in my tailbone that radiated down my right leg. I'm tempted to trim the sides of the cushion to better fit my car seat and give my thighs some relief."
3,It's not really helping,"I'm on day two of using this cushion. I cycle/spin three to four days a week and as a result, my tailbone is bruised. Because I work in a seat at a computer for 8 hours or more a day, and do a lot of air travel, I am constantly trying to find a comfortable and not so painful seated position. So I figured a cushion of some type would help. I chose the Tush Cush based on reviews I read and unfortunately, it's not really helping. Only a little, which I am greatful for. There are less expensive options out there so now I feel I like I could've paid less for just a little relief. I'll keep using it of course until my bone is healed.I do like the handle; Will make it easy carry during travel."
4,Great support,This is a great support pillow for my tail bone. I want to order to order multiples for different chairs in my house! A sound investment if you have tail bone issues.
4,"Good quality, but expensive","I originally bought the Coccyx Cushion because the price was much cheaper than the Tush Cush; however, I had to return the Coccyx Cushion because it had a horrible smell.There is no doubt that the Tush Cush is a good product and does its job to alleviate my tailbone pain; however, I feel like I am being ripped off by having to pay $50 for a piece of foam."
2,MEH,"UNDERSIZED- TOO SMALL FOR TRANSFER CHAIR, NOT RESILIENT ENOUGH TO AFFORD COMFORT OVER THE LONG HAUL. ( 1 HOUR OR MORE)"
3,Didn't like as well as the crunch bars,"I loved the Peanut Butter Crunch so much that I assumed these would be just as good. No. These were too chewy, bland and not a great flavor. The box is so big I'm worried we won't eat them. They have that ""protein bar taste"" and I'm now wishing I'd bought one locally before an entire case. We go through a lot of power-type bars so if they're good we gobble them up for snacks, school-time pick-me-ups, workout re-energizers, etc. I'll stick with the PB Crunch..those are delicious. These...not so much. :("
1,Not on the right track,This work continues to misuse science toward the authors belief perseverence. Too many other researchers are using sound scientific principles and are showing results that counter Cameron's claims. Be cautious that you don't fall victim to tenacity in your own beliefs.
2,NFL Films Super Bowl Collection,"These DVD are good, but they are mis-represented. These are NOT Super Bowl highlight films. These should be called ""Road to the Super Bowl"" DVDs. These are about all the teams viaing for the Super Bowl, not just the two teams that played. If you want lots of film footage of the Super Bowl games themselves, save your money and don't buy these DVDs."
2,Sent an old edition,I was sent the first edition of this book even though a second is already out and has been for years. Not disclosed that this was older edition.
4,Not much for the price,"I loved playing with Fashion Plates as a child and was happy to find these. When they arrived I was a little disappointed in how small the box and contents were for the price. I paid 28.99, but this seems more like an under $20 toy rather that an under $30 toy."
3,It's ok,Only comes with 4 plates. The plates are double sided. It's similar to what I had growing up at a child. Thought they would have improved it since the 1980's but not really.
2,Not what was pictured !,"When I bought these last week the picture was very similar to old school Fashion Plates. Then I opened the package and was ""WHAT???"" Came back on line and picture now matches the product. I wanted old school, would have bought it on Ebay for the same price. More options.That said...I am sure our daughter will love it and play with it. BUT I am disappointed. Bait and switch. Not cool, especially as much as I use Amazon !"
1,I obsessively HATE this book,"The more I hear how much everyone loves it, ""learned so much about 'Orientals',"" the more I hate it. Hey, I got an idea, how about I write about three stereotypes of Japanese culture (fisherman, business men and geishas) and pass it off as insight? This book offends me a great deal."
4,"ABSOLUTELY FASCINTATING, YOU WILL FEEL LIKE YOU ARE IN A DIFFERENT WORLD","This book was completely engaging. The life of a Geisha is fascinating and the author writes in a way to keep you turning page after page without so much as a breath (or any sleep for that matter!). I would recommend it to anyone, especially before the movie comes out in December."
3,"The movie can wait..,a long time.","I enjoyed the book because of it's ability to transport me into another world but when I landed home I could not recall any lasting impression or reflections other than ""Gee,it would have been nice to have a real Geisha"". (not really..,ok,really...I'm a bad man) The set up was full of intrigue,the details rich and authentic but the finale just sort of collapsed like a dead moose on the road.I wonder if Quint Tarantino should direct the movie rather than Spielburg..,nah,some books are better off left as books...or manuscripts for that matter."
5,Hard To Put Down,"When I first started reading Memoirs of a Geisha, I thought it was boring because the first chapter was boring for me; yet, as I kept on reading, I became more engrossed in the book. I could not help but stay up late at night just to read a couple of pages if I could! I recommend everyone should read this book!I loved it! Sayuri's story made me feel fortunate to have the life I am living now, and it made me even more obsessed with Japanese culture! ^_^ Thank you Arthur Golden!"
3,Memoirs --,"Memoirs of A Geisha, Written by Arthur Golden --A small girl living in a quiet fishing village discovers her destiny is soon to be delivered to her very doorstep. In this Novel by Arthur Golden, the world as young ""Chiyo"" knows it transforms and transpires into a world in which she cannot choose for herself -- she succumbs to being taken from her village, her parents, her sister, her Life.From here, Chiyo will learn the hardships, trials and tribulations of what is expected of her at ""okiya"" and endure many years to follow. It is certainly a turbulent ride, but she refuses to sacrifice her passion for justice. Chiyo's glimmer of hope revolves around this: Perhaps one day, she too will become a geisha. Perhaps this is the only way out of ""Gion"" or into the life which once remained a mystery to her.My personal site is located at: www.sindushi.com"
5,A Gem by Golden,"This book was simply wonderful. What else can I say? It was realistic, captivating, and the writing was top-notch. Full of metaphors and a theme that will haunt you well after you've finished it. It is relaxing and yet you are an active reader at the same time. It's a must read and a gem of a book that is this promising writer's first!"
5,Eye Opener,"This book was an eye opener for me. I always thought that geishas' were prostitutes, but it's much deeper than that. The women that do or did this had no choice in the matter. Either they could become a geisha and have a danna, or starve in the streets at that time. Sayuri is such a beautiful woman. Her struggles in her life started when she was a very young girl and spun into her adult life. She is such a beautiful person and she is also a very caring person. This book is a must read. I would advise anyone who loves to read good material to read this book."
2,Not on the Bandwagon,There needs to be a better way to learn about Geisha than having to wade through this book.
3,Good Book: Dissapointing Ending,"I was swept up in this book about Geisha -- something I knew NOTHING about.Really enjoyed the reality of it: After reading the other reviews, I see that others were dissapointed with the neat/pat ending. Boring love story -- no chemistry.I kept waiting for her to learn he was a homosexual or something -- ANYTHING -- more exciting."
1,WARNING: may require sake,"Maybe a little dash of sake would help bring this book to an enjoyable level. I haven't read anything so bad since I was twelve and went through a short-lived (thank god) Danielle Steel phase. It read just like a romance novel: contrived and depthless. The metaphors made me wince. They seemed to slip in every 100 words as if Golden thought ""Oh: time for another metaphor"". I'm delighted to see that there are other intelligent people who don't believe this book should have been on the best seller list for over a year. This will be the last time I let overzealous marketing get the best of me."
5,Breathtaking-a book that still has me thinking about it!,"I am a high school student who is a voracious reader on the side. When I picked up this book, I read it from cover to cover during Christmas vacation. I cried, I laughed, I was spellbound. This book will appeal to mass audiences, from literary critics all the way to students like me. Read this book not because it is on the bestseller lists or you read a profile on the author, read it because you want to be transported to another place, where women painstakingly paint their faces and have their hair coated in wax and ""evil"" comes in the form of Hatsumoto!"
3,A totally engrossing novel except for the cliched ending,"I found the book totally engrossing - a very interesting, descriptive story about the life of a Geisha. I stayed up all night to read it, but when I reached the end, I was totally disappointed. It was a typical fairy-tale ending where all the loose ends are tied together in one neat little, pat ending. Sigh."
4,"I was hoping for more, but I still couldn't put it down","If you're looking for a novel about geisha culture, you've got the right book, but be prepared to get swept up in a romantic story, as well. I'm not particularly fond of romance novels but I found myself rooting for Sayuri. Once I was done, I did have to go back to the acknowledgements just to make sure that it was fiction. Thank you Mr. Golden for writing a book that is still in my head two weeks after I finished it, I love it when that happens."
3,"Great beginning, ending - what a let down!","This was a much celebrated book, just about everyone I know has a copy of it on their shelves. (note how many reviews were written) And I do not deny that I enjoyed it. The writing gets into you into the head of a Geisha, her hopes fears, wishes, dreams (blah blah blah). And also does not do a bad job of writing as a woman. (Not a terrific job, but not a bad job). Portraying what I would imagine to be a very realistic world of Geishas (past).And then the ending undoes all of the sympathy and warmth I felt for the character. She becomes very shallow and munipulative. Almost as if the writer got bored, gave up and wanted to end the book. I, like many other readers, would have liked to see a different ending.If I were to just rate the first 2/3rds of the book I would give it SIX stars. I still recommend the book, but warn against the end, what a let down."
3,Great but also bad.,"This novel rings false among Japanese. The reason is simple: Golden's ""exotic"" setting is not exotic for Japanese people. While I was reading this, I looked for something beyond the exotic setting because Golden's details in culture are what I'd already known. Yet, I found that it was empty under the skin!Yes, you can think that this novel is quite accurate, but don't think that Japanese people act like Golden's characters. Although Golden did a great job on creating an exotic setting, he failed to capture people who lived through the emperor system, the WWII, and the arival of democracy. This is the prime reason why Japanese people don't like this book.Anyway, I am glad that this book is popular among American people and they are more interested in our culture. There has been an invisible big gap between America and Japan, but Golden seems to have made a bridge inbetween."
5,A most captivating book and culture.,"Memoirs is one of the best books I've read. As with most books, you get out of a book what the author has put in. The author no doubt put forth a tremendous effort as an historian and a wonderful storyteller. I will definately recommend this book to my friends and family and be most certain no one will be disappointed.This book is a page-turner that will keep you energized into the wee hours of the morning!"
3,Spellbinding Memoir...well worth the read......,I am a avid reader of memoirs..al types. Some are betterthan others..but this one was one of the better...itwas very descriptive and held my attention....I also justfinished reading Dance to Despair (memoirs of an exoticdancer) by Rebeckka Sathen Black..which I thought was verywell written and a very profound read..very unique...boththese books are great..
2,sappiness overload,"i was in an airport waiting for my flight, and i bought this book in a giftshop to read on the plane. ugh. it was horrible! i almost threw it down the aisle at least ten times. it starts out ok, but once you realize that sayuri doesn't leave the mindset of a 12 year old in the whole book, it just becomes grating. bah!"
4,Good book,This is a novel that will touch your heart. It brings you into another world to give you better understanding of a geisha's life and Japan. It is written with style and also with delicate details. The story is poignant yet touchy. I would recommend this novel to anyone who is looking for a touching story.
