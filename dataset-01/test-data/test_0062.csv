1,Price outrage,"Paperback $7.99Kindle $12.86Outrageous - a paperback is much cheaper than the e-book.That's what is called ripping off customers!Shame on you, Amazon and publisher!"
3,This book was just average,"Becky and Luke have been on their honeymoon traveling the world together for the past 10 months but when Becky gets an invitation to her best friends Suzes twins Christening, they decide to end the honeymoon early and come back home.Becky has grand ideas of how she will be greeted after being away for so long but she is soon let down. Her parents acted very strange when she showed up at their house and it turns out they had good reason. Becky has a step sister that she knew nothing about. She immediately dreams about shopping with this long lost sister but it turns out that Jess is very frugal and hates to shop.I was really expecting more laughs and fun with this book but Becky spent way to much time feeling sorry for her self because of her relationships with Luke, Jess, and Suze. I am still looking forward to one more book in this series to see how life ends up for Becky though."
4,shopaholic and sister,Very entertaining; enjoyed the last third of the book the most. This woman reminded me of a couple of people I know!
3,I love the Shopaholic series....BUT....,"to be honest I was a little disappointed over this newest addition to the series. I have always found Becky Bloomwood to be loveable, flighty, and fun, but in this books she comes off as arrogant, spoiled, and dumb. It could be due to the fact that her penny-pinching half sister Jessica comes off as a saint, in that she is down-to-earth, responsible, and independent. Like the other Shopaholic books, it's a quick read and you think you know what's going to happen but then that ""twist"" comes in and throws you off, which I love, but there is a different atmosphere to this book."
2,Growing disdain!,"I made it through books 1 and 2 without being sure if I was charmed or repulsed by the main character. Book 4 arrived before 3, so I started reading. How very dreadful! Becky's inability to focus on anything except shopping and her own personal needs, her constant lying about even trivial matters, and her fundamental stupidity got to be too much."
5,She does it again,"I enjoyed reading this book as others from the author. ""Becky, character in these books are just too funny'. People would catch me laughing out loud in public places as I couldn't put it down. Becky, is Becky and she will always be clever and ideal in her way, in her world."
5,Amazing Chic Lit... Sophie out does herself in this series!!!!,"Wow. I was excited about the frist three books and now a forth!! It was too good to put down, I couldn't stop once I started.The book starts off with Becky's honeymoon and then she finds out she has a long lost sister and this story is about her finding the sister and being the person she always wanted to be. It reaches a new depth and a new revelation to Becky as she learns from her new marriage, her friends, and her sister."
1,Grow Up!!!,"I enjoyed the first book in the Shopaholic series. I thought is was amusing and cute. But with every subsequent book in the series, I have been more and more annoyed with Becky Bloomwood's antics, and frankly just thought this book was a waste of time. Why does Sophie Kinsella never address the real serious problem Becky has with self-control? She gets into all these messes that she has created herself, and through her pluck and luck manages to get out of them. Becky never does any serious soul searching- everything always just works out for her. That is not realistic. To me, the character of Becky just seemed spoiled and pathetic in this book. There are plenty of other chick lit books out there that are less fluffy than this one- where the characters actually learn from their mistakes and don't continuously repeat them over and over and over. Try those instead..."
2,Eh,"I was stuck without a book at the library a few days ago, and this was what I came up with. I've read ""Confessions"" and ""Shopaholic Ties the Knot"" before, but really, this is too much. Why would Luke Brandon love Becky? She is constantly immature, sneaky, and deceitful, and I don't really get what goodness overcomes this. I probably wouldn't be so frustrated except that I always have to finish a book once I start it, so I was stuck with it until the end."
3,Not as good as the others...,"I have read all of the Shopaholic books, and this one was passable, but not as good as the others, in my humble opinion. Becky continues to be her charming, hapless self, though this time around I found it a little irritating that she practically has a perfect life already, almost destroys it, but then it all gets tied up neatly in a bow in the end. But then again, that's why we read these books, is it not, as an escape from reality? All said, I would recommend this book, but if you haven't read the other Shopaholic books I would read them in order first, and then read this one. Enjoy!"
3,"Still fun, but not as great as the first three","If you enjoyed the other Shopaholic books you will once again delight in this one, although it doesn't have the va-va-ving that the other books seemed to have. It's still a goofy, fun, out there read, but just not as zippy as the first three in the series."
4,Jeep Rebuilders Manual,This is a very helpful guide that I used in restoring a 46 willys.I thought it worth the purches and would recamend it to others who are knew to jeep resto.
2,cja2,"not much help so far , it covers the big stuff but no help on smalli still have to look things up on the net . if i had to do it again i would get something else"
3,Not the Ultimate Review,"Harken back with me to an idealistic time when the burgeoning West Coast scene was sprouting tripped out music everywhere.MGM Records attempted to cultivate an East Coast counterpart in the Boston/Cambridge area. Ultimate Spinach were born of this fertile ground along with such other hopefuls as Orpheus, Beacon Street Union and the more esoteric Pearls Before Swine. Although not quite up to their maiden effort this was nonetheless a very significant Psychedelic relic. The tittle track was/is the standout cut and the last original band offering. Of note, Jeff Baxter from Steely Dan was to launch his career on the less directed third Albumn."
3,Just couldn't get into it,It didn't grasp me in the way that I thought it would. I just couldn't get into it. I wanted something with simpler verbiage.
4,It's not just all in your head...But oh well,"Finally Eve 6 put out another album since 2000's awesome, studio spit-shined (in a good way)opus. The single is good...sounds a bit like ""Promise."" The album as a whole is not exactly different from any other Eve 6 album, and some songs start to sound similar but they're still good. Overall: a combination of the first and second record, using some punk/grunge from the self-titled and using the pop/spitshine from ""Horrorscope.""A-"
4,Great CD!,"This is a great Eve 6 CD i would definatley reccomend it! It really has a rock feel to it. The song ""Think Twice"" was a great single to represent the CD. Eve 6 did an awesome comeback with this. ""At Least We're Dreaming"" shows off Eve 6's musical ability and proves that there not just another cookie cutter rock group. I definatley think that Eve 6 will be staying around for a while. Make sure to check out there tour schedule at Eve6.com for a show near you!"
4,educational/interesting cultural facts,"This film was pretty good. I am writing a historical novel with parts taking place in ancient Europe. I was hoping for a little more in ancient times (the second half became too ""modern times"" for what I want to write about.) However I learned interesting cultural facts and would recommend it."
3,could of been better,This wasn't bad but over all in all it wasn't great. It didn't really truly focus on the Celts. It was about sexuality in Ireland from Per-Christian to today.
3,"One of the less useful books on Python, for me.","I am a relatively new programmer, who has used only Python and PHP to any significant extent, so ...I have Python Essential Reference (1st. edition) and this book side-by-side on my shelf at work. I use Python Essential Reference and the online module documentation almost equally, and I almost never pick up this book."
4,Royal Rumble Results,"Cruiserweight Championship6-Man Elimination Match-Kid Kash(Champion) vs Funaki vs Jamie Noble vs Nunzio vs Paul London vs Gregory Helms-Winner - Gregory Helms (After a shining wizard to Funaki)Mickie James vs Ashley (Special Ref : Trish)-Winner - Mickie James(After a powerbomb)Royal Rumble Match-Winner - Rey Mysterio (Entered at #2, eliminated Orton 2 win.)(RVD , Goldust , and Tatanka Returned)(HBK eliminated by Shane McMahon.

1,WWE Continues to F**K Up,This by far could be the worst Royal Rumble ever. I mean come onthe royal rumble match was not even the main event. Also the World Heavyweight title match main event was total s***.The WWE continuesto rip off its fans with total garbage pay per views theyr'e makingstupid storylines to try and get more fans. I say to to all WWE fans to switch to TNA because TNA actually gives its fans good wrestling.F*** the WWE!

1,Not as pictured,The item that was included in the box is a short story that has smaller and smaller font as it goes along. This is not what is pictured on the website. This is also different than what is pictured when I went to request a return.
1,Don't buy this ever,"I was informed that the Master Massage tables were top of the line. Couldn't be more false.The cushioning material has already deformed after only 4 months of moderate use.My cheaper massage table I got 3 years ago has held up better.AS a long term Amazon customer, I am terribly upset that there is no option for returnor compensation. Amazon should be ashamed to carry defective merchandise like this.I will be posting negative comments on any and every massage site I can towarn off other unsuspecting professional from making this mistake."
3,Very contemplative...but one song does not belong,"O.K. I seem to be one of the few reviewers who actually LIKED Schwartz's Celtic take on the classic Shaker song ""Simple Gifts."" Listen to it--I guarantee your spirit will soar. BUT, it belongs on another CD. The rest of the tracks are more in keeping with Schwartz's ""Aria"" discs, especially the first one. This is a good disc for relaxation and contemplation, a tonic for the mind and soul...except when ""Simple Gifts"" arrives. Yes, I liked it, but it totally disrupts the flow of the album. Maybe listeners can set their players to skip this track and enjoy the reflective quality of the rest(sometimes TOO reflective...a couple of tracks would make good insomnia cures). Otherwise, a fairly good listening experience."
2,If You Read Consumer reports First...,"I did not purchase this frame, but not based on the reviews here. Consumer Reports review stated the picture quality on any frame of this size is not very good as they are all low resolution. I checked this model out locally along with other brands and found this to be true. I also found the SmartParts seemed simpler to use than others.I wound up purchasing three SmartParts frames ( two SP-DPF84) that they call 8 inch that have 800 x 600 resolution. With high res cameras these are much better."
4,The Animorphs are accidently stranded in this good book.,"Though this book wasn't as good as the last one, it still lives up to Animorph quality. The story begins when the Animorphs steel a spaceship from the Yeerks, only to fall into a time warp and end up stranded somewhere in the South American jungle. The story was fairly good, not to mention informative when it came to parts about South America. The characters are still funny, realistic, and unchanged. Anyone who likes the series should read this one though they may not enjoy it as much. Still this Animorph story is good, well written, and even has a surprise ending. The Animorphs are still a #1 series!"
5,A great book,"How can anybody say that there aren't going to bemore books after 11? There are much more books than 11 like 12 The Reaction, 13 The Change, 14 The Unknown, and 15 The Escape. So there.hope I convinced you."
1,Terrible,"Personally I think that this is the worst book in the series. When Jake was ranting on about the Yeerk invasion he said to believe it was true it was futile, futile, I was tolerant but then it grew worse when Marco's jokes were getting really, really bad. And when Marco's jokes get really bad something's got to be wrong. Even so, after this book (except for #12 and 14) Marco's jokes have taken sort of a dive. They aren't funny anymore. Don't make this mistake again, Ms. Applegate."
1,not happy,the switch on this device did not work on one remote from day one. I needed at least one of the remotes to work (two out of three did) so I kept this device. Now after two months the switch is failing completely and if a replacement switch does'nt work I'll return this device.
4,Godd Addition to The Secret,I read Norman Vincent Peale as a teenager. Ask and Receive (from Luke) has always inspired me. Principles from the Secret have worked in my life for years even before I saw the movie. I also have experienced a relationship with god for several years. Thus I can appreciate how well Dr Cloud expands and makes the secret even better. His contribution is in stressing relationships between a person and god and also between other people. I am so impressed with both Rhonda Byrne and Henry Cloud. I think both movies will help a lot of people.
2,Disappointed,I ordered these knives as a gift for my husband who loves to BBQ and loves to cook steak. Several of the knives were dull right out of the package. The ones that were sharp are awesome! I just wish all of them were like that.
2,"Great author, not such a great book","I am a fan of Rohr's, but reading this book did very little for me. I think his message - which is astonishing and wonderful - is better available in other formats. The basic question I came to the book with was this: I understand that suffering is one of God's tools in shaping us; but why does the experience of it have to be so overwhelming and terrible? The book did not come close to answering that. I think its main value is that you recognize that everyone in life deals with the sufferings of Job - and that everyone is mystified by it. So I came away from the book with little. I'm glad that everyone else found the book so wonderful, though."
4,The music is worth the price of admission,"Just a short review on the remastered DVD. The animation jumps of the screen with all the new post production work they have done rematering the movie. But what really makes this a great buy is the music. Hearing the Beatles in the rematered multichannel format is nothing short of stunning. I sat in between my home theater speakers in awe. The Beatles were masters of making colorful layered music and this DVD makes it so you can almost see the music. Along with George Martin's surprisingly nuanced score, the music alone in this DVD is worth the price of admission."
5,Review of DVD YELLOW SUBMARINE,How delighted I was to be able to purchase and enjoy The Yellow Submarine. It was in excellent shape and I received it in a timely fashion.
5,This is my one of my top five all time favorite movies.,"Yellow Submarine is one of my all time favorite movies and one of my favorite childhood memories. I loved the imagery, the music and can remember watching it and singing along. It is a movie that I want to be able to show my children and I am really glad that they re-released it."
2,"FABulous music, visually stimulating, but tedious.","I first saw the film when I was 6 or 7 years old, and the story seemed lame then. I recently watched it with approximately 200 undergraduate students, and found myself in the position of defending it. Problem is, I hated it also. (With the exception of ""Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds"") Loved the music, always have, but a bit disappointed that they abridged the tunes. Somehow the theme that loves conquers all, what the world needs is love to solve its problems is a bit lame. The fact that the Beatles themselves did not partcipate in the making of this mess except to make an appearance at the end says much. This is not a Beatles movie, they did not even do the voices for their animated cardboard characterizations. This is escapism at its worst."
5,Which Beatle is coming over to show this movie? Paul or Ringo?,"Next to ""A Hard Day's Night"", this is my favorite Beatle movie. I thoroughly enjoyed Yellow Submarine when it came out in 1968. I purchased a VHS copy when it first came out in an affordable edition. I wanted to upgrade my tape to DVD. But, c'mon fellas, $25 for a 40-year-old animated film by Peter Max?This DVD better come with blotter acid & a Nehru jacket from Carnaby street! Oh, and if I have my choice of surviving Beatle to deliver the disc, send Ringo! He knows ""It don't come easy""!---John Paul, Oklahoma City"
3,It was ok,"Music was great but the movie albeit a cult classic, was just ok. I was disappointed but my husband loved it!"
4,Trippy 60s Cartoon in Vivid Color,"This DVD includes classic Beatles songs like ""Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds"" and ""Only a Northern Song"". Select French, Spanish, Portugeuse or Japanese subtitles to help learn some other languages along the way."
4,"""It's all in the mind""","John, Paul, George and Ringo set sail on the Yellow Submarine to save Pepperland from the Blue Meanies. This animated romp doesn't star the Beatles, but that hardly matters because it is the Beatles who sing all the songs in this movie. The DVD includes a new song called ""Bulldog"""
2,Letterboxing Cuts Off Top and Bottom!,"I thought this looked odd when I watched it on DVD in the letterboxed widescreen format. My fears were confirmed when I found a copy of the VHS ""full frame"" version at a yard sale (for 50 cents -- what a deal!).It turns out that part of the top and bottom of the movie were covered to create the widescreen version (which I think was the only version available on DVD). There is more picture at top and bottom in the full-frame VHS version! Although the left and right are trimmed a little on the VHS full-frame version, that's not nearly as noticeable (and annoying) as the missing top and bottom on the DVD.If this ever is released again (maybe when the remake comes out), I hope we get the full picture next time. Trying to watch it with the top and bottom or the sides missing is a less than ideal experience, to say the least."
5,Poor Ringo.....poor lad..never did no harm to noone,If you have the slightest appreciation of comedy and/or great music buy this! I'd love to chat but......If I spoke prose you'd all find out I don't know what I talk about! Hey I am only 15 and I can appreciate this film! THAT says something!
4,Useful but dated but so is subject,These older books are free and interesting. The cost is $0.00 so you can't go wrong and often I like the prose of 100 years ago more than current works.
5,"Very, very happy with my new bedroom lamp","This is a great and stylish lamp that really looks nice in our bedroom. It is very bright and I really love design of it. Assembly took me around 15 minutes, so don't be scared, it is straight forward. I am very happy with my purchase!"
4,Lumisource Icycle lamp,"Well, I agree that there were scant instructions for putting together the lamp; however, it was not hard to figure out, and I must say I think the lamp is quite dazzling. I also found the quality to be just fine - the base is heavy and supports the lamp well; the range of dimming is fabulous. I am wondering if the fact that one has to put it together is making people think the quality isn't good, vs pulling the lamp out of a box fully constructed, all nice and complete."
2,"cd was too cheap in material, so i'd rather download it","I watched it once on cd. I like the story, but after that, the cd got corrupted, so I couldn't continue watching it. So I downloaded it for a cheaper price."
5,Fantastic!,"This is a fantastic movie that demonstrates how great acting and story telling can be done without computer-generated effects and explicit sex scenes. The actors tell the whole sordid and sad story through their expressions and body language. The cinematography is also amazing. Watching great silent films like this is a real treat, and often shows just how modern film making has lost something."
3,Not bad for a cartoon,"This album is quite good, on a musical standpoint. It's very silly, of course, but the music is suprising good (especially the song entitled ""Timmy Livin' a Lie"") When this came out, I was already a fan of the show, but never got around to buying it. I stumbled across is and for the price offered, I thought why not. Well worth what I spent. I only gave it 3 stars because there are only 2 songs on the album. It's what you would expect from an album produced by Parker and Stone, some goofy tunes that you can still rock out to."
4,Review of The Pawnbroker,"This is a gripping tale of one mans loss of humanity and his regaining of it.Mr. Wallant's untimely death cut short what would have been a brilliant writing career, although he did manage to write three other books before this one.I am a great fan of the film, starring Rod Steiger in his breakout role, although many of the characters are the same in the film as in the book. There is great plot development from the onset, and the story really keeps you riveted to the book.My one qualm with the authors writing is that he uses very, for lack of a better term, ""poetic"" descriptions of places and emotions which I found just a bit tedious.Barring that, this is a read that I would highly recommend to anyone that wishes to explore the depths of misery and redemption."
2,a smooth elevator ride,"this album is instrumental... i didn't figure this out until i actually HAD the album in my CD player... i bought it for one song, but i must say, i didn't know Sailing was accompanied by ... i think it's a tuba. it's a good album if you're studying, or working on something, or if you're just cleaning house, or if you're reading... if you want to sing along, pick something else."
2,It was okay,"I wanted to really like this documentary, but I didn't, and even felt a bit uncomfortable at times. I felt that some events they were using to show God's love & faith, were a bit of a stretch. I'm not saying that I doubt God's love by any means, and I'm not saying I don't have faith, because I do. But... some of the examples used I did not think were strong enough to reach a ""faithless"" audience. I know the producer(s) meant well, but this was not as good as I thought it would be. I appreciated the honesty in the filming though, (like when they were at a witch festival & not getting immediate results with passers-by). I have to say that I have seen better ""documentaries"" of this sort on Christian cable networks. I can appreciate this effort though & don't think it is a total fail. I encourage you to watch it & make your own opinion."
2,Boring,Mario was touted as the tenor who would overtake Josh Grogan and Andrea Bocelli. I don't think so. Nice voice and good background music but nothing exciting.
1,Follow your heart all the way to the trash can,"Mr. Frangoulis has really outdone himself on this one. This isn't the worst album i've ever heard but it comes pretty close. I believe that i'd rather listen to a group of female cats in heat for 72 minutes than listen to a single track of this album again. There is some good news though, you finally have something to scare off those raccoons that keep digging in your trash."
2,Strings? Flutes? Horns?...and some piano?,"Nice music, but Aaron Copland does this sort of thing better than Guaraldi. The CD cover is somewhat deceptive...""never before available performances"" omits the word ""live."" Nit picking? Perhaps...but disappointing nonetheless. I prefer the original ""pure"" sound of the trio, without orchestral embellishment. However, it seems palatable enough for most Guaraldi fans."
5,Spectacular,This single is amazing and I am suprised to hear that amazon is selling this item available in the Netherlands. Don't worry the song is in English you can hear a small clip form do-licious.nl go there..it's awesome
3,A Weaker Middle Volume,"Croaker is missing, so Lady takes over control of the Black Company and the narration of this book of the series. In order to rebuild the Company and the armed forces of Taglios, Lady poses as an avatar of the goddess Kina, who seems basically equivalent to the Indian Kali, who is dedicated to bringing about the Year of Skulls, which entails a lot of death and destruction.The book feels like it has more of an independent plot than the previous one, but it still leaves a lot unresolved for future books. The character of Lady is not that well developed. Having her narrate the story is not much different from having Croaker do it, and you don't get much sense of her as a very powerful, very old being. This is still a good read, but doesn't live up to the earlier parts of the series, or other similar fantasies that are out there."
2,WOW,"Jamon Jamon is one of those spainish films you watch because Penelope Cruz is in it, but, by the time the naked bullfight scene rolls around, if not before, you realize that not even the best looking actress around can make up for such a bizarre and ridiculously sketchy peice of cinema. Meant to be funny, the outrageous sexual innuendo that is the script is just too strange to be humerous or even erotic.The plot set up in the beginning of the movie, which had potential, breaks down as a result of the plethera of random hook-ups, many implausible, and by the time Silvia makes out with her fiance's father, one is just too wierded out to care. Some themes adressed in the movie are masculinity and the role of the man and woman, but through poor acting and trippy cinematography, even these are too blured to amount to any semblance of profoundness. All in all, if you're looking for a good movie with Penelope Cruz in it, watch Belle Epoque."
1,No sirve.....SOLO ES SEXO SEXO Y MAS SEXO,"Vi la pelicula esta, y me resulto una porqueria. El trama de la pelicula no tiene ningun sentido, el tio se acuesta con quien sea, y la tia tambien. El final es todo raro y pues no tiene sentido. El titulo de la pelicula no se deberia llamar ""Jamon Jamon"" sino mas bien Sexo y mas sexo."
3,"Sexually charged...and, well, that is about it...","Yes, this film is done in a very Spanish tradition of surrealism. Yes, deep and dark humor present at most times. Yes, Penelope Cruz is very sexy and good, as Javier Bardem is, too. But, this film fails to even come close to Bunuel's or Almodovar's genius. It is not bad in its own right, but it is not the best film to come out of Spain in recent years. I am sure there are many wonderful Spanish films being made every year; we just don't see them.Camera work is bad at times; at other times, the plot becomes annoying."
3,Poor design,"Bought this for my 5 yr old. Instead of the cape velcro-ing aornd the neck, the velcro attaches to the straps of the chest plate. This causes the straps to fall off his shoulders and the weight of the cape cause the chest plate to rise up under the throat causing discomfort. My son wore it for about 10 minutes, that's all he could take, now he just wears the belt which I have to put on for him."
4,Absolutely Freaky...until the cops pull you over,"I thought I'd have a little fun, and dress up as a batman last June.I guess I should have paid a little bit more attention to the product description when it said 'under 13.'This outfit doesn't really fit a 30 year old SWM, but I bought it with a gift certificate and couldn't return it.I had the excellent idea or making it fit by greasing it with vasoline. Amazingly enough after 20 minutes of trying that did the trick.I walked around town for a while, trying to show off my new costume. Yes, it was a little hot and the vasoline did begin to to get warm, but I was pretty confident that I was getting the attention of the ladies. In fact, I think that I was getting everyone's attention."
5,The Cruxshadows have done it again,"hey for those who haven't broughten this album yet, it's a must have for cruxshadow shadows. the latest in the masterpieces of the band. Besides of their talent and skill and their lyrics, they always put on the best live shows. This album has songs you can sing to and pour your heart into them cause it strikes the heart. If you are just finding out of the cruxshadows, you will not be disappointed.. and if you are you can beat the hell out of me.. I LOVE THEM"
2,arrsteph - My Review for Academy Extra Credit,"I had to read this book for school this week. The first 20 - 30 pages were very slow and boring. In the end, the book was a slight more interesting. I would not recommend this book to my peers. I did not enjoy reading A Gathering of Days.Some of my ideas of how the author could have made this book less boring:1. Added more suspenseful climaxes2. Taken out unimportant information3. Wrote this book in regular format, not journal format4. Used better word choices throughout the context of the book"
2,Dull,"I thought this book was extremely dull and didn't deserve to win that award. But otherwise it was alright, and some parts were somewhat interesting, but it sure didn't keep my attention."
5,Absolutely fantastic!,A must have for all Zombies fans. Includes just about everything the Zombies ever recorded. Probably the most underrated band of the 60's. Of particular interest are the rare unreleased recordings and alternate takes.
5,A Fantastic Display Figure!,"Perhaps not the best figure for children, as the pose is a bit rigid with few options in the articulation. However, the likeness to actor Christopher Eccleston is astounding. If you're merely looking for a likeness of the Ninth Doctor for a collection like I was, this figure is entirely satisfying."
3,Not as good as previous efforts,"""Ride On"" is certainly not a bad album, especially not if you prefer Izzy Stradlin at his most punk-ish (which I don't). But it is not as musically versatile or indeed as melodious as his two best records, ""117"" and the superb, still-to-be-recognized classic ""Izzy Stradlin And The Ju Ju Hounds"".I prefer Izzy's previous blend of hard rock and acoustic blues-rock, but ""Ride On"" has its moments as well. There's just a little bit too far between them."
2,very dissapointed !,"I purchased this book thinking it had some info on the the 2.3 and there was ZERO. The 2.3 is the most sought after 4 cylinder in america out of all the ones mentioned in the book. It should be stated in BOLD print that it does not cover the 2.3. I feel I feel mislead. Dont call the book ""pinto"" performance if your not going to cover one of the most desirable motors ever offered in the pinto in america."
1,"May work great, but they don't fit my Cobra MR HH425LI","Well, purchased the Cobra HH425 waterproof, handheld marine radios about a year ago and still haven't seem to find a earbuc/mic that works. Thought that a Cobra brand earbud would work, but apparently not the waterproof marine radios."
4,Like Magic!!,"Monster iClean really does work great! I use it on my laptop and The Better Half's flat panel. Like a brand new screen! It would be five stars if it weren't for the price but nothing else does the job without damaging the equipment. So, use sparingly and make it last!"
4,Great stuff,"This stuff is like magic, if you have LCD's, camera's on and on. The only reasons 4 stars it is pricey. The good news this bottle will last a while."
4,Review from a Registered Nurse,"My father was recently in a nursing home - although I am a registered nurse, I could have benefited by reading this book first. The topics discussed are areas where I was inexperienced. Having insight into this process will guide the caregiver and at the same time allow the support that is needed."
5,Another favorite,"There are so many different oracular sets out there now, so many people trying to show an easier or more insightful way to get in touch with what is going on around and within you. Of all the decks that I have used, this one beats them all. Not only is the art impressively communicative, but the book is equally as chaming. I do not have the words to praise the artwork of Brian Froud, which I have had the pleasure of seeing many places other than this work. The book is not only of the highest quality (being hardbound and sewn rather than paperback and glued), but the author manages to cajole the reader into the empathic, intuitive response that is so necessary for such reading and invariably lost in the attempts to ""read it right"" and learn all of the meanings perfectly. Of all the non-tarot decks I have, this one is by far my favorite work."
5,The Oracle of Faery Wisdom,"I adore this deck! I have extremely accurate readings everytime. The Faeries will not sugar coat the truth. They will tell you the truth, even if you don't want to hear the truth! I am amazed everytime I do a reading how dead on they are, as much as I hate to admit how right they are sometimes! The Faeries will speak to you through Spirit and their messages are so clear. The book Jessica wrote is filled with warmth and her love of the Faery show! Brian's art is gorgeous. If you want to work with the Faeries to help you improve your life, healing work, meditation, etc, they will help you if you simply ask them. Reading with the Faeries Oracle is an excellent medium for them to connect with your spirit. Very easy to read for beginners to advance."
1,Stinker,"This game is for young kids only. The graphics are not worthy of an xbox game, nor is the sound. It is just mindless fighting along the lines of late 80's style arcade games with comparable graphics...I thought we had escaped those types forever. In addition to all of its problems, the characters keep saying the same 2 or 3 phrases over and over and over and over....did I say and over!The only xbox game that I've seen worse than this one would probably be sneakers and I gave it a higher rating, just because it doesn't have one liners that drive you crazy. This is a great gift for that neighbor that you don't like...his kids will drive him insane inside of 3 minutes. Don't buy this new, or used, and if someone gives it to you plan your vengence early."
4,Mixed feelings,"It's a nice book and I bought it because of the great Amazon reviews. However, a couple of things did not make sense to me. Most of the time you lift a flap you see something you would expect. However, 2 of the flaps made no sense whatsoever to me. 1) ""Peel a banana, find a ... monkey? The monkey is sitting inside the banana? Behind would have made sense but not inside. 2) Part a curtain, find the opossums? Huh??I guess I prefer books to be either all fanciful or all educational, not a confusing mix. That said, my girls can't wait to get their hands on it :)"
4,keeps Toddlers amused and entertained!,"~ ~This little book, looks at first like any ""lift"" the flap book, but the cute illustrations, and surpising ""finds"" under the flaps really worked for all my toddlers (5).They get the biggest kick out of looking under a ""rock"" to find some interesting bug or reptile!The only trouble is now, out in the garden, we have to lift the rocks and logs to look for worms and other ""pets""This is an inexpensive gem to keep kids amused for a little while."
1,"Poor quality, small in size","Compared to other 2x2 gauze pads I've used in my practice, the weave is much thinner, more open, and less absorbent. In other words, you use more to get less."
3,"Good for the new person, forget it if you're experienced","I will admit the book was full of gramatical errors, but that is common on the net. So you get over that. And the beginning of the book was completely worthless. Learn to change windoze background. Wow..thats amazing...although, I would definitly consider it worthwhile if you want to learn the BASICS of hacking and get general ideas. And if you're experienced, definitly go somewhere else. This book will bore you."
2,Snoozer,"Pretty much a waste of time. Kept waiting for the good stuff, some really nasty info, which never came. Book seems geared towards real beginners. I am one, but this to me even seems weak. The author seems quite impressed with herself."
1,"oh my god, what a waste of money...","This book was a great disappointment for me...although I got a degree in computer science I thought that I might be able to learn something from this book...the truth is however, I didn't, and I don't think that there are many people out there who can. Even my 14-year old son knows alot more about computer security, and he's not a hacker. I can't understand the reader from Belgium who gave this book 5 stars. Could you PLEASE tell me what it is that you actually learned from that book ? And as for the book being a perfect present, do you really think that any kid will be impressed by telnetting to port 79 and giving a 'kewl' command ? You don't know much about children do you ?I'm sorry that I'd not read about Mrs. Meinels hacking 'career' BEFORE I ordered the book, cause in that case, I'd never have bought it..."
1,The Happy Lamer!,"Carolyn P. Menial is a perfect example of what, in the terminology, is referred to as a wannabe, a lamer, or an AOL kiddie. Unfortunately, it often happens nowadays that people write books with no clue on the subject they are writing about. The sad thing is that there are dozens of even less-educated kiddies who will buy it. And they have, as Carolyn P. Menial's case proves. However, one thing amazed me: Carolyn P. Menial has of course no idea on any subjects concerning hacking, or, for that matter, on anything that concerns computer. Yet her command of what supposedly is her native language is even worse. Here we have an illiterate who at the same time is a lamer. And she writes books - and sells them! O tempora, o mores...To Carolyn P. Menial (at the moment posing as a ""Security Expert"" - sic!): publishing your daughter's data was an excellent move to hit you. May it eventually prove to be the least damaging one of all that attacks that you will hopefully suffer."
2,Happy Hacker Hype,"Why buy the Happy Hacker book? In case you aren't just totally awed by it being written by yours truly, Carolyn Meinel (shock, shock!), here are some other reasons to get it. The Happy Hacker book is much more than just reprints of my Guides to (mostly) Harmless Hacking that you can find on countless hacker Web pages. They... COME ON DOWN! This is crass advertising for a second rate book, culled from,LOPHT,LOD etc.Even we in Britain are beyond the baubles in this trivia book.O.K good fro REEL bEGINNERS,SEE WHAT i MEAN,NO SPEEK ENGLISH GEEKS.pTHETIC PLAYGROUND HUMOUR.My Computer SysmANAGER,COULD KNOCK A BOOK UP LIKE THIS IN A MONTH.gET REEL,STOP PLAIGIARISING, BE A REEL Russian/Bulgarian HACKER.kNOW wot i mean."
1,worst book on hacking ever !!!!!!,"this book is so badly written and has so little informational value, it even outdoes the ridiculous 'secrets of a superhacker'....compared to Happy Hacker this book looks like the work of a genius...... the only fun you'll ever get out of this book is when you tear out every single page and burn it....and of course, when you look at the cover"
1,lame,"1) Read books published by o'Reily. 2) C,Unix Security,TCP/IP,BIND,Sendmail,Perl would be a good start. 3) type format c: and press yes. 4) Install Linux,FreeBSD,netBSD,Solaris x86 5) try hacking your own box before bothering the rest of us.Carolyns book is going to create a big waste of bandwith. Any annoy the real security professionals."
1,Disappointment!!!,"I've loved Basement Jaxx since their beginnings with FLy Life. I've seen them live twice. I was eagerly anticipating this album. I've been putting off writing this review because I thought I needed the chance to absorb it more. Nope, my initial reaction still stands. It sucks. Three good songs and the rest is just boring."
1,Not What I Expected,"The description of this book indicates it is hardcover. It IS NOT a hardcover book. It's also very small. There are a lot of good pictures, but little writing. If you are looking for a nice hardcover book with lots of details - this is not it."
2,Find something else,"I've been very disappointed with the results. I have all new 1/2"" sheetrock over studs and this throws off phantom signals all the time. It's not near as good as a 25 year old Radio Shack Archer brand stud sensor I gave to my son. Wish I had it back."
1,GARBAGE,"I bought this for simple use.... YEA, OK!! All it does is make me mad!! All I get is a error on the thing!"
4,Good,"I also am writing this, like the other reviewer, because of the bad reviews. I bought mine about 10 years ago at lowes. I have no problems with it, just have to learn how to use it and be patient. I usually check and mark the studs 2 times to make sure. My son has also used it with no complaints. I am sure they have better ones now, but this one has served its purpose and I would get another one!"
1,I don't think I've ever seen anything so bad!!!!,Absolutely terrible!!! The acting was so bad. More for teenager getting their first glimpse of breast. Plenty of fake breast and sex scenes but other than that it's made for ignorant folks.
4,Just what I expected!!,"I loved the first Piranha and this one comes mighty close to being just as great in my opinion. It's exactly what I'd hoped for. I really liked Danielle Panabaker & Katrina Bowden and the rest of the cast werent bad either. The ""Baywatch"" scenes are classic - make sure you watch through the end credits for more Baywatch/Hoff funnies. I bought this dvd straight up without seeing it at the cinemas and am so glad i did."
3,T & A,That is all this movie is about. The Piranha take back seat to the nudity here. If you want T & A then this is for you.
2,Horrible!!!!!!!,"As my title said ""horrible"" Ving Rhames and Christopher Lloyd returns in minor roles the only part I liked is when Rhames has the shotgun legs and when I first thought Gary Busey would have a big part but no (SPOILER!!! he is eaten at the very begining) this is a definite insult to the franchise."
4,Nice!,"Well as long as you know going into this movie that it is supposed to be cheesy you will be ok. This is an ideal popcorn movie for the simple fact it is funny, cheesy, and plenty of boobage (come one who gives thumbs down to that). Not a bad movie to add to your 3D collection, although I have seen way better 3D in other movies this one adds to the ""popcorn"" movie effect. I gave it three stars because it is a good piece to watch with a couple of friends while drunk or drinking, or hanging out. For the price you cant say no to this one. A watchable cheesy fest with boobs galore."
2,stay out of the water....,"and away from this movie. Unless you like terrible horror movies. I knew what I was getting into with movie but still had to give it a chance. the first film was also ridiculous but was fun and had some decent moments. This was nothing more then beautiful very well endowed women bouncing around, If you were to combine any after midnight cinemax movie with a syfy channel original you have piranha 3dd . There were not even that many scenes with the piranhas.I am giving this 2 stars only because of the very fun/funny performance of Mr David Hasselhoff, if the hoff ever made a movie with Bruce Cambell I would be the first to watch.overall a subpar B movie that tries to get by on T&A; and ultimately comes up short"
4,Not getting the hate for this,"It's EXACTLY what I was hoping for. A bunch of sexy silliness very similar to the first one. This one's a bit more over the top....maybe that's the problem? Honestly if you're not a fan of schlocky horror I don't know why you would be interested in this in the first place. The price is certainly right for this so if this looks like something you'd like, go ahead and try it because I""m sure you will."
1,Dark & hard to read,"First I have to say I'm not a ""young reader"". I read about 1/4 of this book before I stopped. I found it very hard to follow and dark. I wouldn't recommend this for kids."
4,A Delight For Young And Old And In-Between,"""Once upon a time, in a gloomy castle on a lonely hill, where there were thirteen clocks that wouldn't go, there lived a cold, aggressive Duke, and his niece, the Princess Saralinda...""This was a fast and fun romp. One part wicked to two parts whimsy, it's a book to delight all ages. Children will love the story, and adults will enjoy the more sophisticated humor and word play. If you know anything about James Thurber, (or maybe even if you don't), you'll appreciate how much fun he had writing this story. In the Foreword he explains that he wrote The Thirteen Clocks when he was supposed to be working on another book. He called this ""an example of escapism and self-indulgence."" Sixty years later, it served the same purpose for me.The funky and stylized artwork is entertaining, too. When Zorn of Zorna dons his princely raiment, he looks like he's wearing a frilly tablecloth. But it's a welcome change from the uniformity of today's computerized graphics."
5,The Tower Treasure,Frank and his brother try to find their friend's car. On the way the brother's are get call a call from their dad that someone has found coins leading to a tower where a king stored his riches he thinks someone has been stealing the treasure. The brothers only have 12 hours to find out who is stealing it because the tower is crumbling! Will the mystery get solved or will the theif get crushed? Read the book and find out.
5,"Ahhh, those Bette Davis eyes","I love the oldies, back when Hollywood meant glamour, keeping the dirty laundry private, and the talented actors/actresses actually outweighed the talentless ones. What can I say, I'm an old fuddie-duddie."
2,I CAN BARELY SEE IT!,The movie is sort of a classic. But the lighting is real bad from this criterion selection . I don't know if its my dvd player or a bad product. Maybe I should have bought a new edition instead of a this used item. But I'm too lazy to go through the process of returning it.
3,Don't skip this!,"Consider this album a must have for any type of ""metal"" fan. Harmony Corruption is one of the first death/grind albums I ever heard, and after all these years I still enjoy listening to it. This isn't some blood and guts/kill your mom music. The lyrics are intelligent and the music backing it is surprisingly well done. This band normally has an extremely chaotic sound, but this album shows that they know how to put together an actual tune."
5,BLASTING!!!,"Good song structures, very intelligent & socially aware lyrics, and it's a total guitar riff-fest! Fun to growl along with. A must for metal fans."
1,Disappointing,You will be very disappointed with this tape if you expect to learn much about the diagnostic techniques of iridology. The video discusses the topic at such a broad level that it is useless to anyone who has even the smallest previous exposure to the topic.
3,"just loved this book, so informative","love the world of ballet, that I can't read enough about it. This book is everything I hoped it would be."
5,Just what I needed,"I am making a cake for a Vegas style wedding celebration, and this cake pan cooked up perfectly for my dice cake!"
4,A great album with one major disappointment.,"In the same caliber of Jesse Colin Young and the Moody Blues, Orpheus established a unique sound comprised of great harmonies and acoustic guitars. While growing up, in Boston, in the sixties, the music of Orpheus was legendary. I can only surmise that their unfortunate lack of national recognition was due to poor industry representation.This compilation of their greatest hits is an expanded version of their album ""Orpheus Ascending"" and should please any acoustic-rock aficionado. My only disappointment is that it does not include their best song ""Can't find the time (to tell you)"" as well as another good hit ""Brown arms in Houston""."
4,Is my request for a review correction too much to ask ?,"Amazon.com,I initially reviewed this album based on past knowledge of this group and your prior incorrect track listing. Now that you've corrected the track listing, is it asking too much to have you also correct or delete my review ? Thanks.John Hebert"
5,Great Classic 60s Folk Rock,In high school (Boston) I was a great fan of Orpheus. There first two albums I played until they were scratched beyond listening pleasure. I could could not believe it took so many years for there music do be released in CD. The Best of Orpheus is great. I only wish they would release their first album on CD.
1,Don't waste your money on this,"This game was really hard to play because you have to use the stylus to move Spongebob around. He doesn't always go where you tell him to go, and he keeps falling off things. It might be more fun on another game system, or if you could use the arrow pad.If you do get the game, level 2 is really hard but once you get past that it's easier."
3,Controls are frustrating!,"This is a standard side scroll 2D play game. You play as Spongebob, Patrick and Plankton and move through different levels jumping over objects and collecting coins (sleepy seeds). The storey is OK the graphics are OK but neither are exceptional. This would be a simple game except the game controls are so frustrating. All the character movements are done with the stylus?! You swipe left to go left, swipe right to go right, swipe up to jump etc. There is no option to use the D-Pad to control your character. I am sure Nintendo loves to produce games like this so you will wear out the touch screen sooner and have to buy another DS. There are some cute video clips between levels of the game. I also enjoyed playing as Plankton. This is the only game I have had where you can play as Plankton."
1,Deni storage bags suck,"These bags will NOT work with the Food Saver Bag sealer machine. They are paper thin and when i tried to put a steak in the bag it ripped down the side, I tried it three times and went to Sam's Club and bought a pack of food saver bags foe $39.95. They work great and are a lot thicker than the Deni bags and will protect against freezer burn. When I need more I'll be going to Sam's."
1,buy premade bags,"Bought these in addition to the Deni 1940. It came w/premade bags. They work great. These are a pain. They have to be cut. Only 1 side is sealed. When used in the 1940, all of the air does not get sucked out. Wish I would have never bought them!!"
5,Impressive,"This is a great effort from the Adult Comtemporary ballads ""Whatever Happens"" to Freestyle ""I'm a Victim"", ""Mid Up My Mind"", etc. to the Dance-Pop tunes ""I Never Heard"", ""Taste the Bass"", ""I Wasn't Born Yesterday"", etc. Safire shows alluring vocals throughtout and the production is really good. Highly recommended to any pop music lover."
1,Not compatible with 2003 Acura TL Type S,"Although it was listed as compatible with 2003 Acura TL Type S, the item is not compatible with the said application. I am rating it 1-star to attract attention to the compatability issue; otherwise, the item looks like a fine filter."
2,2000 sound,The album has a couple nice tracks but doesnt remind me of the best of 2000 so it probably didnt impact the music scene at the time of its release. Tracks worth listenin to - Cheatin on me; Dont think I'm not;Cant come back-
3,Average Album,"While I feel that Kandi has a great voice, what makes this album less pleasing is the lyrical content. What is up with all these ugly themes? It makes it seem like she's had a history of finding love in all the wrong places. There are only four tracks that stand out, ""Hey Kandi"", ""I Wanna Know"", ""Talkin' About Me"" and ""Easier""(being that the lyrical content is a lot different than what dominates the entire disc). Note to Kandi: Sing and write songs that are not only based on your personal experience, but based on everyday life."
2,Disappointed!,"I'll tell you why. After hearing the amazing smash hits Kandi wrote for TLC (""No Scrubs""), Pink (""There You Go"") and Destiny's Child (""Bills, Bills, Bills""), I thought that her debut album would be perfect. But I was wrong. Kandi's voice is just not suited for today's modern female R&B, which is full of edgy lyrics, hip-hop beats and confident posing. So she instead focuses on classic southern soul, traces of which are heavy in her only hit ""Don't Think I'm Not."" That song is the standout track on here, and it isn't even that good. It has too much of an old-school feel. I also thought ""Hey Kandi"" and ""Sucka For You"" were catchy, and ""Easier"" was a smooth duet with Faith Evans, but there's no obvious hits on this entire CD. If you want good R&B go with TLC, Pink, and Destiny's Child's albums. I'm waiting on Kandi's next one."
3,A step back,"Sounds like ND is trying to recapture some of their Scum sound, which is weird since nobody on this album was even in the band when that was recorded! Not to say this album sucks but for grindcore its not as good as the original line up. These guys did much better with a thrash/death metal sound. Just check out Fear, Emptiness, Despair for example."
3,"Simplistic, but entertaining","I was glad I finished this book even though it didn't keep me coming back for more. It was a little too simplistic, although the innocence was refreshing. I look forward to reading other Berg novels that are of a more adult style."
3,High Hopes For This One,"I've been wanting to read this for over a year now. Not sure what I was expecting, but it just wasn't ""there"". I read others by Berg & sadly, this is last on the list. I did get a few laughs out of it though. Berg does a great job in making us feel 13 again. Katie was an obviously likeable character with all her female pre-teen drama & you just couldn't help but smile."
5,captures perfectly the angst of adolescence,"Berg has done it again -- she has the uncanny ability to capture the inner thoughts of women (in this case, girls) at their most vulnerable. From her gorgeous (but addicted to shoplifting) friend to another friend's overbearing mother, our young narrator captures perfectly the confusion and pain of growing up female. She develops a crush on the handsome gas station attendent who rescues her one day after she falls into the ice and thinks of him even as she has uncomfortable sexual experiences at a drive in movie with her popular friend. Even the lesser characters are well drawn: her friend Cynthia's mother and grandmother, Jimmy and Taylor. Although young teens would love this book (I think it would make them feel that others go through many of these issues), I think the real audience is adults who remember the pain of these years as though it were yesterday. Very touching and affecting."
5,The most enjoyable hours you will spend - reading this book!,"This book was sweet, well writtem and truly touched me. A fast read that will leave you wanting more. I have never read a book by this author before but am looking forward to reading more."
3,Dangerous,"""Country Mouse City House"" has been in my collection for awhile now. Compared toNashvilleor1972, there is no track that jumps out at me. Recorded in Spain, this material isn't bad. Some of it is very good, but it doesn't stick in my head. ""London Bridges"" floats with a pretty melody and an unusual lyric, ""Really should stay off that corner, someday someone will get killed, they put up a sign to warn you it's dangerous."" ""Hollywood Bass Player"" & ""Nice to Fit In"" are nice tracks. On ""Italian Dry Ice,"" Rouse seems to be competing with Leonard Cohen for a ""Limited Vocal Range"" award. ""Domesticated Lovers"" seems faceless. Overall, Rouse's average music is still worth listening to. However, there's nothing essential here in my humble opinion! Enjoy!"
4,misunderstood album,"While the first two studio albums are definitely of better sound quality, this album highlights the Elevators' ability to rock out in a live setting. What makes this album truly interesting, however, is the fact that it is actually a studio recording with crowd noise overdubbed onto it. Thus, this is almost like listening to a rehearsal of the group in the studio, albeit with crowd sounds. Don't let this album scare you away from further exploration of the 13th Floor Elevators. Definitely get the first two - they will make this one that much more enjoyable."
1,STREAKS,"TheMonster AI ICLN-S iClean+ ScreenCleancleans the screen well, but inevitably leaves behind streaks. No matter how hard I try, I cannot use it on my computer display or HDTV without leaving streaks. I don't plan on purchasing this product again."
5,NO STREAKS!,"I purchased this cleaning solution for my HP w2207h monitor - it has one of those shiny ultra-bright screens. What was once impossible to clean without leaving streaks now looks like it did on the day I bought it.I picked the two small bottles instead of the one large bottle so I could bring one along in a laptop case easily. It only takes a few sprays to do the job, so this should be basically a lifetime supply for a home user.The only minor negative is the microfiber cloth - it leaves a little lint behind. No dealbreaker, though - the cloth still works great besides that."
5,Good Product,"I bought this to clean my laptop screen....works great! I also used it on my Video iPod and it took out the scratches. You really don't have to use that much, so the two bottles will last quite a while. I highly recommend this."
3,Nicely presented but skimpy on the food,"I sent this to my Dad for his birthday. He said the basket was beautiful and he really appreciated the way it looked. However, he said that the snacks were nice, but there weren't enough of each. For instance, he said there were only 5 pistachios! I don't know if he was exaggerating, but it would be nicer if Dad were satisfied with the food - he has never made this complaint about a gift basket before (and I send him one every year or so)."
5,you got to get this video,got my video on aug 12 i find the video vary infomative i wouldlike to try some of the methods in the video in my upcoming swimming lessons i think malon takes great intrest in her students she pays attendtion to what the student is doing. and she stays in her game zone if a emergency does occur she would beright there i hope that my teacher will be like her thanks i am looking forward to more videos or maybe a book
5,The Man Called Flintstone,"This video was purchased for my special needs adult son, and the story line holds his attention for the entire film! He now wants to buy a bowling ball-what fun!J."
1,A rather lame ending to the first wave.,"This was released pretty much after the 6th and final season closed. The movie was pretty much where the families Flintstone and Rubble go on a European Vacation, and end up getting into trouble with enemy spies, and other hi-jinks. The movie itself is very boring, and the songs used were terrible; especially the one ""When I Grow Up""; the one where Pebbles sings. For a half hour show it was classic, but they stretched things too far when they released a almost 90 minute movie. Stick with the series from 1960-1966; anything else will be cheap, and horrible."
3,"Some fine writing, but don't make it your phirst phoray","Look, Tom Marshall and Trey Anastasio are a great writing pair, historic even, and it will take decades (okay, maybe days) to realize the importance of their collaborations. But, IMO, this simply isn't a great Phish album. Junta and Ghost, for example - great albums. Picture of Nectar, Lawn Boy, and Hoist - great for other reason. Farmhouse... feh. If you like these songs, get some tapes of Trey solo shows and buy a copy of the Tom & Trey farmhouse sessions, Trampled by a Dover or whatever. Come back for this one if and when you realize you're a completist and simply can't leave the hole in your collection."
3,"Good songs, stupid lyrics","Musically, this album is top notch. Great rhythms, catchy hooks and solid grooves abound. What keeps this album from being a five-star selection are the lyrics, which are at best, trivial and pedestrian. The chorus of the opening title track includes the painful couplet ""I never ever seen the Northern lights, I never really heard of cluster flies."" Excuse me? Cluster flies? The profoundly inspired chorus for the song ""Bug"" is ""Bug! It doesnt matter"" repeated ad nauseum. The nonsensical lyrics for the funky ""Gotta Jibboo"" are even more heinous. The offenses are particularly frustrating because these would be GREAT songs if the band had chosen to collaborate with a more competent lyricist. If you like your lyrics lightweight and banal then Farmhouse is an essential disc for your collection."
5,It's a Gotta Get,"This cd is a great Phish cd, it's probily one of the best cd's I've bought in tha past 3 months.It's a GREAT cd! You MUST GO GET!"
2,This is phish?,"ok this is ridiculous.When i heard phish was comin out with a new cd a while back i couldn't stop smiling... I got the cd and said to myself ""Who the hell is this?"" I knew the songs from hearing them live but a 5 minute version of piper? RIDICULOUS i'm gettin tired of hearing heavy things on teeny bop radio. I'm gonna go listen to Rift now."
3,Fun but unexplosive,"This review is purely from the point of view of studio albums. I have Nectar, Hoist, Billy and Story (and a few live albums). I think one of Phish's strong points as recording artists is their ability to give the album a wonderful, encapsulating mood and feel. Farmhouse has a lot of mood. But compared to the other CD's it is relatively low key for Phish. It also doesn't feel quite as contiguous. The explosions and beautiful, trancsedental moments coupled with an overall theme make the other albums very special. Somewhere in that sum, Farmhouse lost me.However, the album isn't bad. If they played the whole album at a live show, I'd be more than satisfied. We haven't heard quite the 'voice' that is on the album either. It is somewhat more personal and reflective then the other albums. It also isn't realy responsible for me to write a review so soon... but oh well...All in all.... I feel the simplification and lack of a truely new sound and mood cripple the album."
3,weakest of Phish's latest studio releases,"Lacking the experimental creativity of ""Ghost"" and the jazzy explorations of ""Billy Breathes,"" Farmhouse is a compilation of some old tunes and some of those sleepy grooves that the live shows slip into like ""Gotta Jiboo"" and ""first Tube."" It's great to hear Farmhouse, Piper, Heavy Things and Bug, but much of the rest of the CD is slow and not the explorative, eccentric Phish that I miss."
3,Yawn,"Well, another Phish album has come and gone. I don't think it is possible for them to write a bad album, so my 3 stars are in comparison to their own work, not other bands. Pretty ""pop"" album. A couple radio-phriendly songs are included to boot. If you are a causual fan, you'll love this disk. For more hard-core fans buy it (of course), but expect to be bored quickly."
3,not that comfortable for a smaller-framed person,"The quality of construction and the price are certainly decent, but I was definitely disappointed by how much pain I was in after I carried my laptop around for a full day. It seems the bag is made for person with an average to slightly wide set of shoulders, and mine are more narrow. This means the bag doesn't sit properly on my frame. It's not possible to adjust the distance between the shoulder straps, so there's really nothing I can do to correct the situation. I really liked my old bag (made by Sumdex) a lot better."
3,Don't throw out your Guarneri chin rest!,"You'll need it.The Ohrenform chin rest is abysmal because the clamps don't fit the fittings, they definitely are not designed properly.What I did was dismantled the fittings from my old Guarneri chin rest and replaced the ones on this chin rest with those.Doing that, the chin rest fit fine.The Ohrenform is very comfortable. It's centre mounted, a natural placement of a chin rest if you think about it, so many people do place their chin over the bit of the Guarneri chin rest that goes over the tailpiece.Anyway, after you're done with stealing the Guarneri's brackets, you can go ahead and throw it away! (or use it as a standby?) (or firewood, I don't know why the Guarneri is standard on violins.) The Ohrenform chin rest is wonderful. Give it a try!! :)"
4,Contemporary Soft Rock Band from Australia,"This is the 2004 album release and actually my first hearing of Grinspoon having been informed from a good friend about the band. Several of the songs upon listening to them sounded familiar to me from Australian TV spots. 'Hard Act To Follow' is the most popular sought after song on Sydney pop radio, probably due to the catchy tune that repeats itself. Grinspoon is a group of 4 young Australian men from around Melbourne that have a common look and touch about them. A few more songs are worth a mention like 'Bleed You Dry', 'Better Off Alone' and 'Hideaway'.This by no means will be my last listen to Grinspoon and this album was a decent replication of contemporary Australian sounds in the late 20th century. A must for australian soft rock fans. Also music lovers who enjoy the Hudu-Guru's should enjoy Grinspoon."
4,Practical book,The book is very usefull in the everyday-practice for acupuncturists/physical therapists who work with dryneedling!!Each part of the body is in a different chapter and therefore it's very easy to find the information you need!
1,Socialistic drivel,"If you want a good book regarding the Founders and slavery, look to Paul Finkelman's Slavery and the Founders, not this disappointing mess. The organization is poor, there's not a logical flow to the information provided, and the author has a tendency to ramble. We know the Founders failed to implement the Declaration and Jefferson was a hypocrite on many subjects. Don't waste your time hearing it over and over again in this book."
5,Excellent Thumbnail Sketch of History,"This was the 4th copy of the book that I have bought. I gave the other three away as gifts. An excellent read, and can be put down and picked up again without losing anything. I finally learned why the Armenians hate the Turks, the genesis of the Spanish Civil War, how long Rome was a republic, and so much more that I was curious about but never took the time to research. It filled in many of the holes in my knowledge of history, and also provided a time line for events. I teach, and am continually astounded by students' lack of knowledge of context in studying history. Should be required reading for all high School students."
5,Perfect,"We were unsure of the gender of our baby, so when we came across the Prince Charming bedding (on another site) we fell in love with it. It was expensive on the other site(s), so we were happy when Amazon added it to their inventory. The bedding looks as nice in person as it does on the website. It is very well made, and the comforter is very cushy."
5,"Boyish, yet sophisticated!","I bought this bedding for the little boy we are expecting in December and I absolutely love it! It is extremely well made! The colors are neutral and sophisticated, yet definitely ""boyish""! There are plaids and multiple colors of gingham, making this set easy to mix & match with material if you want to supplement the nursery. For example, I am painting a piece of furniture with shelves the golden-yellow color found in the bedding and distressing it. My mom is making basket covers out of gingham material to line baskets for the shelves as toy storage. The little frogs are embroidered and the set looks very expensive - comparable to those found in high-end boutiques. Actually, I found the set in some boutiques selling for upwards of $300. Overall, the set is fabulous and I would highly recommend it!"
4,If it only were a single album...,"There's some REALLY great stuff on here. ""Out Here"" in a perfect world would be: Side One: I'll Pray for You, Signed D.C., Listen to My Song, I Still Wonder. And Side Two would be: Stand Out, Discharged, and Doggone. I LIKE Doggone's drum solo!! The only long drum solo that never gets boring. Dig that tympani!! There's your album. Screw everything else including Love is more than Words!!"
3,not the right hat,"WHen I saw this hat I was very excited because I hadn't been able to find it for several years. The picture shows a navy blue hat with white front, blue bill and CAROLINA blue NC on the front. The hat I receive has a NAVY blue NC on the front with CAROLINA blue outline. Only reason I kept it is because it actually fit."
5,1906 is not far from 2008,"For anyone being crushed and canned within the (mostly) incompetant and self-serving system of American Educational Faculty personnel, this book is a fair warning to any prospective college student (of any age) as to what they are really signing up for. I would suggest it as required reading prior to completing applications for any US institution of ""higher learning"". I completed a BA, MBA, and PhD...and found two professors in all that time who even vaguely gave an idle damn about the students they were supposedly educating. I have since found that comparative discussions with peers have proven my experience to be anything but unique...indeed, my observations have met commonplace agreement, and therefore are all the more disappointing as a result. Hesse called it fairly and true way in advance of current times."
2,Not very sturdy,My son received this as a birthday gift and it broke the 2nd time that he played with it. While I was putting it on him the plastic belt just snapped in half. Luckily we had a different belt from another toy that we could use with the gadgets. The previous reviewer was right about the difficulty of taking the gadgets on and off. There's no way that my 4 year old son could do it without my help. If I had the receipt I would have returned it.
4,Heck of a story,"See storyline above.Lochte and Darden have written a fast-paced, very readable, action mystery. I didn't get a chance to read the first Nikki Hill novel 'The Trials of Nikki Hill',so the character of Nikki seemed a little shallow. Overall though, the book reads well by itself. The story moves at a steady pace until the action packed finale, which was entertaining, yet surprising. The relationship between Nikki and Virgil seemed a bit contrived. Didn't seem to have much chemistry holding them together. Overall a nice effort by Lochte and Darden.Recommended for legal thriller fans."
3,Little Dissapointed,I have another blues cd from Etta and I liked it more.This one is very good but it was a little bit light for my taste
3,LEXX,"First aired as a TV series LEXX,is a good thing to own as part of your personal collection. With a wonderfully wierd crew aboard a living spaceship the adventures never end,and this is one of them. Awesome!"
4,Tea,Taste great. I love this tea it is great for individual on blood pressure medicine who would to maintain their blood pressure.
3,Fishy,"This was a trial run for me... The product was extremely fishy, but after a few pieces, the taste becomes oddly decent. The smell made my pregnant wife sick. I won't get it again, but it was worth a few bucks to try."
3,didn't keep,There were some good examples and points in this book but it wasn't good enough that I kept it after I was done reading it.
4,Sin Must be Dealt With,"Ramm rightly wants to discuss what he feels has been a neglected and abused teaching of Christianity, namely sin.He uses as his main thesis the thoughts of Blaise Pascal on the subject: the Biblical teaching of sin is offensive to reason and repelled by academia and intelligentia, but without it much of human history and life remains opaque, but with it there is much reflection upon social history and progress.His trip through the thought on this vital topic among theologians is engaging, but leans too much on the more famous liberal theologians,i.e. Schleiermacher, Tillich, etc. He does touch on however when this doctrine gets out of its God-given function, it disturbs one's whole theology.A good read on a vital topic."
5,el mejor disco de fey,es el mejor disco de fey mas bailable un sonido electro pop como vertigo pero mejor y con canciones muy buenas vayan a comprarlo
1,A Waste of Vinyl,A classic?! Please... This recording ranks up there with Trout Mast Replica as the worst recording of all time!Note: Will clear a room in less then 10 min!
5,In need of a change????,"Want something jazzy. Want something noisy. Want something sad. Want something oddly joyous. Buy this record. Life in a nutshell. I've listened to this record in the USA, in Europe, and in Africa. I've taken it everywhere and it has always been enjoyed. Buy it and hit the road."
3,"Great quality, but the price makes your eyes water","This is the genuine Canon ink cartridge. In my opinion, it is best to use manfacturers' ink (others will disagree and use generic). The quality is great and I've never had a problem with one (been buying them for 6 years or so) - but they are pricey. My Canon ip8500 takes 8 cartridges or about USD100 of ink..."
1,Zzzzzzzz,"My 6 year old likes this game a little bit. My husband and I would rather scrape and paint the side of the house. There are much better choices for games: Animal Crossing is a good non-violent game, and Gauntlet Dark Legacy (if you can find it anywhere) has provided a lot of hours of fun too."
4,Whats with the orbs?,"Another great Mario Party game. It's just not Mario Party 4. The biggest difference I have found in this one from the last is the orbs. They become confusing and it's not as much fun as finding mushrooms in boxes. It's sometimes hard to differentiate the different orbs and what they are going to do.The mini games are always fun and exciting. Although, I have played this game for a very long time now and some of them are still not unlocked.This game is fun for the whole family, my 4-year-old even enjoys playing it!"
2,Party Pooper,"Well when I heard of a new installment of the Mario Party series I was thrilled. But I got excited for nothing. This game is the same as Mario Party 4. Except Mario Party 4 was more exciting with the new graphics and it being on the Gamecube and all. But it just didn't work for Mario Party 5. First of all, the boards are extremely boring, and the introduction of capsules (which give you a ball and you can purchase only the item you get whenevr you want). There is no lottery shop. Most of the ""all-new"" mini games are pretty mucht the same: repeadtedly pushing a button or dodging something. As for the format I don't like the different stars introducing the games. The Ice-Hockey is almost impossible and Volleyball is the same you got on Mario Party 4. The introduction of new characters can't even save how bad this game is. 1 on 1 games are OK, but contribute little as you can't duel as much. It is too expensive. Save your money."
4,If they had a 0 this would get it!!,"The first Mario Party was ok, but at least it was entertaining. This game is a disgrace. At first, you should at least get all the mini games at the beggining of the game. You dont. There should only be mini games. There isnt. Mini games are the only thing that draws people to this game and they still have boards. Thats boring. Nintendo get rid of Mario Party. Bring back classic games and make us all happy."
4,not very fun,i played this game for about 2 hours then got bored.great for kids though my 4 year old sister loves it. new mini games and only 5 boards!!??!! very easy to understand but i reccomend renting it first.be careful what you want and dont want.lol
5,Best Mario Party. Period,"I know the drill. Every Mario Party game is basically the same thing, so I'm not expecting everyone to see this game in a different light. But this game is slightly different. I think the formula is better than that of most other Mario Party games, and for the most part, I bought this so that my friends and I could add something else to our mix of Mario Kart get-togethers and whatnot and for that purpose, Mario Party 5 scores! Buy this if you and your friends need something new and interesting to do. It should keep the entertainment going for the next two months at least."
2,stop the madness,"the mini games are bad,the format is bad.the boards are bad,the story is bad, and ofcourse the game is bad,dont waste 50 bucks on this junk.get mp1 and 2"
2,crash the party,"You notice how in movies and books how 90% of the sequals are s***. Well guess what? It's the same thing for video games. I must admit that the old Marios were tons of fun. But then that stupid Nintendo 64 had to come around and start the new Marios. You could by an old nintendo system and a classic mario game for almost half the price of this garbage. And i can guarantee that you would get more enjoyment and playing time out of a classic then one of these imposters. Plus 90% of gamecube games suck. If the title of this game didn't have the word Mario in it, this game would have a hands down 1 star. Do yourself a favor and run as far away from gamecube games as you can."
1,Mario party lost their touch,"Mario party 5 is the worst out of all of them! The super duel mode is poor because the cars are slow, the capsules was a dumb idea because your never sure what your going to get and they dont do anything good at all. Most of the mini games are boaring and the levels are boaring also. They lost their touch! I asked my dad for it on christmas because I thought it would be better then all the other ones I played. Major disappointment! If you have a Gamecube get Mario party 4. Thats just my opinion though!"
5,Another party.,"I love the mario party series. But the thing i dont like is that each party is the same but they just change the graphics and places to go to. In this game it is very fun on multiplayer but like other mario parties it gets boring after a while. The graphics r not very good on this game, it looks more like N64 graphics and the color is dull. The sound is different but it is still like any other marios. This game is fun but it is just like any other parties it gets boring after a while, and the graphics r not as good as the others."
1,GREATEST GAME EVER!!!,"Wonce eye saw this on da movie of movies eye had 2 buy dis!!! It's sooooo bad!!!! I loved it! I fyou hate bad games get dis! It""s goad! REELY!"
4,RE:This is is THE best Mario Party to date!,"I think that this game is going to be alot of fun. I played the other Mario Parties, and they were fun! My mother bought me MP4 for the Nintendo GameCube for Christmas last year, and I was satisfied with it, probably because it had cool Mini-Games in it.However, the ONLY thing that I will probably hate about MP5 is the waiting time, because when I played the other Mario Parties(including 4), the waitng time were VERY short, and I've seen gameplay movies of it. But I think that MP5 will be a player's choice, for both young AND older gamers. And so what if there really isn't anything new in MP5? You don't need new things to Make Mario Party. All you need are Mini-Games, 3-D board maps, a few Nintendo characters(ones that have to do with Mario, of course), and, my favorite, a few friends over so you can play ALL NIGHT LONG!!"
4,A few problems assembling,"Love the way the lamp looks, but it wasn't easy to get the globes in place. There were extra ""rings"" around the base of the lamp holders. My husband had to remove those before the glass globes would fit on."
1,Phone worked great for 7 months,"This is a great phone set I bought from Costco. After bringing them back 3 sets of top notch Panasonic phones because they all stopped working after 3-6 months, giving me cryptic error codes, I thought I had found a brand that has its act together. Not so. After 6 months one of the handsets went dead (and not, it wasn't the batteries) I opened it up to see if any cables were loose (no), screwed it back together and it magically continued to work for another 2 months. Now its dead again .. and on its way back to Costco. Maybe its time to go back to rotary phones again :)"
5,Read this book,"Liza Charlesworth's book is a complete guide that fills you in on all the deatils of the cumbersome process that is IVF. And Charlesworth does it with style. This is a a fast read (hard to believe that s'thing so complex and technical as IVf can be a page turner, but this thing moves.) Unlike other cold and technical books on the topic, this one is reader-friendly, accessible and warm. As someone who went through IVF herself, Charlesworth has made sure that hers is a compassionate guide. She shares her stories and those of other women going through IVF. These are the very stories those of us IVFers seek out daily on the Web. If you're thinking about IVF or are starting a cycle, you'll want to buy this book. It will give you the low-down on the process, help you prepare for an IVF cycle (physically and emotionally) and most of all it will give you hope."
1,A lot of fluff,"I was not impressed by this book. I really thought it would be more about what a couple can do to help with the success of IVF. Not only that, but the chapter on ways to help with financing, is just nuts. What if you have no family to ask for help? Selling Avon or hocking things??? I mean really! Not helpful at all!"
3,"The more I use it, the less I like it : (","I am a fool for buying this microphone for vocals and acoustic guitar. It sounded so detailed and crisp in the guitar center studio compared to anything else they had. But then I started recording with it... It brings out an unflattering nasal quality in my vocals which is very difficult to tame and sits very precariously in a mix. Here's an idea for getting a great vocal sound on a budget. Do rough tracking with your sm57/whatever, no preamp. When you have nailed your vocals out, rent a sony c800g microphone and a neve preamp ($140/day for both is reasonable). For the price of one tlm 103 and a decent preamp you can record ten albums or so with top of the line equipment in your home studio. The only catch is that you will have to track all your vocals for each album in one day, which shouldn't be a problem. AudioRents dot com is a good place to check out before you fall into the trap of buying a new mic with terrible resale value."
1,wildwood,i was very disappointed in the writing of this book. the characters were shallow and immature and very self absorbed..the story was boring and just didn't seem to go anywhere. The story was underdeveloped. i just kept waiting for the story to get better and it just didn't.
2,Would not recommend,I did not enjoy this book. I have a problem abandoning a book otherwise I would have. Whiny characters that I did not like.
4,Dada was there...,"Appropriately enough for a band who got their name from a William Burroughs novel, early Soft Machine demonstrated on their first two proper albums a version of a Burroughs type ""cut-up"" song structure and a sense of surreal humor/weirdness. A lot of the magic may have come from Kevin Ayers and Robert Wyatt, who went on to make well-regarded arty albums of their own that often still retain a sense of fun. Too bad so many of these late sixties bands only had a really brilliant album or two in them (Syd Barrett for another); must have been the drugs (an intended irony there; thy may have both helped and hurt.) The Machine changed most of their members and made not-bad jazzy music but nothing with the odd sense of rock fun as these two items, ten second alphabet recitations and all."
3,1+2=3.5,"3 1/2Although there could be dismissals with the rightfully underground and underdeveloped 1, the smart pairing with a far more muscular Volume 2 leaves little to doubt SM's progressive aptitude with a language all their own."
1,Problematic? You said it!,"I've always been a staunch defender of ALL and have previously enjoyed everything they have ever done. Sorry to say that this would have to be their worst ever. Absolutely no hooks, not catchy and I found myself shaking my head in disbelief at how most of the songs sounded exactly the same.Sure the lyrics were cool (but more preachy than they have been in the past) but what's the point of good lyrics if you forget the song two minutes after you hear it? God I hope their next is a return to form as this is the most disappointing cd of the year so far."
4,"Package is 2.2 oz, not 2.75","Not sure if I should post this here, as there is no problem with the food itself--my fish love it. However, the title states that it is a 2.75 oz container, but what arrived (and what is actually shown in the product image) is a 2.2 oz container. I did not return it (not worth the hassle), but hopefully they will fix this. The last bottle I bought (from Walmart, not here) had a ""Bonus 25% more"" so it actually WAS 2.75 oz. I think what happened is the company stopped doing that, but they have not adjusted the title here."
4,15 years ahead of it's time,"A clever, rollicking little mixed genre number that would be selling like hotcakes if it was new on the shelves. Aliens have brought much of Earths mythology to life, and in the midst of the craziness a detective tries to solve a murder. Yeah, there are some clumsy points, but overall it was a great read. I read somewhere that Koontz has pretty much disowned this one, and it will not be on the steadily growing list of new editions coming out.A real shame, since this is better than a good half of the rest."
3,Mediocre toilet-time reading,"I started off with high hopes for this book. The pictures were funny and the title promising. I had just finished ""Food Court Druids, Cherohonkees and Other Creatures Unique to the Republic"" and was in the mood for more character sketches. As for this book, it has its moments, but overall is very dry. The observations are obvious. There are few witty remarks or stinging barbs. It's just not very funny.I would have to recommend the title cited earlier over this one."
3,had no idea this album was released,I remember hearing about dawn's group lucy pearl in 2000 but didn't have the slightest idea that this record also came out. Hopefully en vogue will reclaim their popularity in 2006.
1,EN VOGUE?,"Simply put, this record lacks imagination and innovation. En Vogue's production team fills this record with dated material. I am a big En Vogue fan, however I am resigned to say that maybe their time has passed. Their only hope is to reinvent themselves by finding a new, fresh sound. I thought that Masterpiece Theatre might be a great album, unfortunately I was sorely disappointed."
1,BUY LUCY PEARL INSTEAD,"The comparisons between Lucy Pearl and En Vogue were inevitable. Departing diva Dawn Robinson joined forces with her new group, Lucy Pearl, while the remaining members of En Vogue returned to the lab for their second go-around sans Ms. Robinson. Simply, ""Masterpiece Theatre"" is a lackluster experience. Producers Tommy and Denny have a dated sound with classical music samples that are terribly misguided. Lucy Pearl is a fresher, more innovative concept. Although I purchased En Vogue with high hopes, they failed me once again... Spend your money elsewhere. But between the two albums: buy LUCY PEARL."
5,Personality Revealed,"This is a good , easily understood book on personality traits and tendensies that are useful in uderstanding your mate, or in helping cousel or people who have marital or other conflicts."
1,"This book is still listed on amazon, but there is a second edition with a slightly new title","I'm far from a feminist, but the language is very dated and irritating. The gender roles in US in the 1960s are taken as a starting point for the discussion. This makes it harder to understand the key differences between the temperaments and types. There is nothing wrong with the basic content of the book, but it needs an update. Since there isPlease Understand Me II: Temperament, Character, Intelligence, you should buy that book instead. It is fully updated and not a part 2. It is a five star book"
5,"good book, informative and interesting","I bought this book from a friend's reference when I told her I wanted to learn more about people and personality, and I was very impressed by it. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to learn about why people are different from eachother"
3,Basic but still good info,"The info presented is fairly basic for anyone who has already read a lot of psychology, but even still I enjoyed the outline of the 'why' people tend to lean towards one character behavior or the other and what the strong and weak point are of each. I already knew my 'type' but enjoyed learning why I am the way I am and that it's 'normal' to say, be an introvert and not something I have to feel obligated to change, as I often have felt."
3,PPST is Easy!!,OK I don't know about the Praxis II subject area assessments but don't buy this book for the Pre-Professional Skills Test. If your college or university - heck if your high school hasn't prepared you for this you should demand a refund!!! I'm not in to these testing services they make way too much money on us so don't buy this book for the PPST.
1,Groundhog day,"This was a new item. Opened it to view the DVD and it will not play. It just shuts off. The DVD player reads ""error"". I contacted the shipper the next day and still haven't heard from them. Contacted Amazon and it is in review for refund.We went and rented it from Blockbuster."
1,DVD PRODUCT ERROR - NOT IN DTS SOUND!,"I am not sure what the oversight is, but beware! This DVD does NOT come with a DTS (Digital Theatre Sound)Soundtrack as advertized on the package and still by Amazon. It comes with a Dolby Digital 5.1 Soundtrack (among other DD 2.0 foreign language tracks)Although I LOVE this film, I had already bought the original DVD, and shelled out the money for this one just to have it in DTS sound. I was very disappointed and now have to go to all the trouble of returning it. So, for those of you who enjoy DTS, you are apparently out of luck. If anyone knows of any reparations being made by Colombia / TriStar, please E-mail me!"
5,Keeps getting funnier and funnier and funnier and funnier...,"I bought this for my husband, who absolutely loves it. Each time you see it, you catch more humor. A definite classic."
5,It's a tradition!,It's a tradition! My wife and I have watched it every year for 20 years on Groundhog Day. It came out the year we were married.
1,oh boy,"I hate this movie with a passion. The darn film is a total repeat and therefore is totally annoying and pointless, I am still angry with myself for watching this peice of trash."
5,"""I'm betting the train'll swerve first.""","When Bob Whiley doesn't spend his day the way fate wanted, he get's a second chance. And a third chance. And a forth chance. etc..Groundhog day is a comedy classic and deserves it. Bill Murray is great.Starring Bill mUrray"
5,Teachings about Reincarnation,"This movie is great but many people fail to see that the real subject is reincarnation. Phil is tied to one day simulating how we are tied to to the wheel of reincarnation by incarnating on this plane until we get it RIGHT! We reincarnate in many different bodies, ethnicities, countries, and possibly worlds. We have to find the truth about ourselves and who and what we are. The movie ""Arabian Nights"" has this same teaching. The part where the Sultan makes a lowly drunk a Sultan and then trows him out to be a drunk again follows the reincarnation pattern. Sometimes we may incarnate rich and others poor. It is up to us to find the ""truth"" of our circumstances. We may keep in mind Buddha or the Christ when we ask ""what is it we are supposed to find?"""
5,A profound film,"This film is great. To me, it shows the learning curve of the soul. Every lifetime that we have on earth can be analogised in one of Phil's `groundhog days'.At first, when Phil learns about his immortality, he chooses to satisfy his ego - pulling women, eating unlimited cream cakes etc. However, a few `days' later, he learns that this kind of lifestyle can give him no satisfaction. Eventually, after experiencing many groundhog days, Phil realises that principles such as compassion, integrity and goodwill provide the deeper kind of contentment and satisfaction which he seeks. Once he grows to this stage of maturity, his groundhog-day-cycles come to an end, and he lives happily ever after. Sounds like Heaven? Too right."
3,GOOD COOK CLASSIC PASTRY BLENDER,"THE PASTRY BLENDER WAS OKAY, BUT I SHOULD HAVE JUST BOUGHT ONE LOCALLY. hAVEN'T USED THE BLENDER YET BUT IT LOOKS OK"
3,Not A Page Turner,"This book was definitely not what i expected. The only thing that kept my attention was the ending cliffhanger. It was a slow read that was a coming of age story. I was not connected to the characters in any way really which was a downside to my reading this book. I may read the second installment of this series but I am not going to rush to buy it. It was an okay read, not anything special. I definitely commend Snoop for starting to co-write books. However, 50's G-Unit books are much better thus far, I would read them 1st before the Doggy Tales' installments."
2,Too big,I don't understand how come this collar couldn't be adjusted small enough for my cat. It also took a very long time to arrive.
4,Great Mobile!,"After having to return two mobiles for not fitting my daughters crib, I purchased this one praying I would not have to return it. The crib's rails are not ""conventional"" and are rather thick. I was ecstatic and relieved that this mobile fit! My almost 3 month old loves this mobile. Instead of staring at the ceiling fan in the nursery, she becomes enthralled now with this mobile! I will place her in the crib and turn on the mobile during the day to take a shower and she does not once cry. At night when she is sometimes inconsolable, I will place her in her darkened room and the projection, movement, and varying music choices soothe her. The only downside is that it will only stay on for 10 minutes. There is a remote that will start it once it stops, as to not disturb baby if she has fallen asleep. She has not once fallen asleep to it yet, but we are not quite at that stage. I am very happy I purchased this mobile and highly recommend it."
1,Terrible product - makes grinding noise,"We got this mobile as a gift. Unfortunately, this mobile is very poorly designed. I came to check the reviews to see if other people were experiencing the same problem of the mobile getting stuck spinning. Turns out this is a common problem. The issue is the canopy is separate part and must be attached to the top. If the canopy opening is not perfectly circular then it will rub against the main assembly causing it to get stuck and make a terrible grinding noise. I have tried rubbing Aquaphor as lubricant and tried widening the canopy attachment but nothing works. Luckily, we have another mobile as I will be tossing this one in the trash."
4,Good buy -- just consumes batteries fast,"We bought this for our newborn. Even my 2- and 3-year olds enjoy it. The songs are great and the rain sound seems to soothe the baby. We haven't experienced any problem with it except that it consumes batteries fast and when it restarts the songs, it sort of starts then stops but it was no big deal for us. Using the remote helps remedy the start-and-stop songs."
3,No where near quiet,"The pump its self is pretty powerful, but it is NO WHERE near quiet. This is by far the loudest pump I've ever owned. I was also upset to find it cheaper at Walmart than it was here on Amazon. Wish I would have hunted for something else."
1,Microsoft Wireless Entertainment Desktop 8000,Absolutely the worse keyboard/mouse set on the market. It is also the most expensive so one is easily fooled into thinking it must be better than the rest. It almost crashed my system and I had to do a restore several times to get rid of the problems it created. I returned it to AMAZON.
4,The Reason Why You Should Boycott FM Rock Stations!,"I found Greg Howe's music through a Guitar Player magazine review. I have never heard anything by Howe (or Tony McAlpine) on FM radio, ever! This is a huge injustice to the musician, and music fans! This is why Hollywood and the RIAA need to be retired! The only reason I give this album just four stars is that I think Howe would be more successful working as a fusion/jazz-funk artist. Howe can blow away any of today's ""rock guitar gods"", but will never get the recognition he deserves in that arena (for obvious reasons). Rock will never reach it's potential as long as Hollywood continues with the ""blond hair, blue eyes"" image it continues to shove onto the public!"
2,average quality,This set is very light weight with average quality feel. The box presentation was good. One fork was bent. Not something you can use on a daily basis.
3,Instructional and Informative,The book has very good information and is a pleasant read.I gained some new insights and practical methods that I will practice.The grooming was most ineresting.Well worth the price!
2,Psycho-Cybernetics 2000,"I read the original Psycho-Cybernetics by Maxwell Maltz in the early 70's. I read it again last month and then read Bobbe Sommer's version. I think the original is better. Maltz keeps it simple and focuses on the subconscious as the primary goal seeking mechanism. I thought Sommer's book diluted the message with cross messages from other self help techniques. Maltz's method works great. It's simple and effective. It's not a self help book, it's a book about reprogramming yourself. Sommer seems to turn the science into a self affirmation exercise."
3,a decent read,"This book is an update of the original book by Maxwell Maltz's book Psycho-Cybernetics. Maltz was a plastic surgen and became aware of the changes that many times took place in people after surgery, particularly surgey of the face etc.He developed ideas about self-image and what can be cone to improve them. This book builds on the original work of Maltz and is worth a read.This book, like many others is a self-help book and if read and used correctly it can help.J. Robert Ewbank author ""John Wesley, Natural Man, and the 'Isms'"""
2,Not for American glass,"This is a truly beautiful book, but is only helpful if you are looking for information on English vaseline glass or vaseline glass in general. Only about 5% of the book covers American vaseline, which is where my interest lies, so the book was a total disappointment to me, and pretty much useless for my needs. But if you like pretty pictures, go for it."
3,Lightweight Jakes,"Having thoroughly enjoyed ""Charleston"", I was excited to find that John Jakes new novel was in a similar vein. The new book, set in December of 1864, examines the city of Savannah during Sherman's occupation during the holidays. The book attempts to show that though the country was divided, they were still Americans, this illustrated by the generosity of either side at times during this time. This was a feel good novel, but not very deep."
2,Disappointed,"I wait with anticipation for John Jakes to complete a new book. I enjoyed ""Charleston"" but ""Savannah"" is a disappointment. I usually can't put Jakes' books down, this one was hard to pick up. When I retired from teaching in 2001, my first ""fun thing"" to do was to re-read the Kent Family Chronicles. I accomplished it within a month. It took me almost a month to read ""Savannah"". It lacked character development and suspense. I will be waiting for his next book though, as I am a life long fan."
5,MORE THAN A HOLOCAUST HORROR STORY,"At first, I found the title and subject matter off-putting, then I couldn't PUT this book down! Don't let the title fool you. More than just a story of a Jewish girl's plight, this story tugs at your heartstrings while creating a voyeuristic atmosphere compelling you to read on and find out what becomes of the title character. It's a riveting story about one woman who's real life was stranger than fiction. I was amazed at how fast I finished this book simply because I could not wait to find out what this ""Jewgirl's"" fate was to be."
5,Good and filling,This is not a low calorie bar. It will fill you up when you have to miss a meal or need extra calories. I've tried lots of bars and these have the best taste and texture I've found. Be sure to drink lots of water with these.
2,Painful to watch,"These women may be competent and interesting, but you'll never know it from watching this. They play at being California girls giggling and mugging for the camera. They come off as incompetent ditzes. They go out on the road, confuse and manipulate some genuine old dudes, buy some random junk they are more interested in for what it looks like than for what it was, throw out some half formed ideas on how to transform it, dump everything on an already (after one episode) long-suffering third partner who is expected to turn it into something sellable. He's the real hero of the show. Plus one star for Alan.Mike and Frank (American Pickers) are the real thing. These girls come off as annoying poseurs."
3,Easy to use,This product comes with an easy measuring spoon that fits in the container so measuring is a breeze. I have used the Acai in drinks and even on mashed potatoes. The consistency is almost like Nesquick chocolate powder. The flavor is not noticable so can be put in anything.
4,When Dance Music was Dance Music,"I bought this album a few months ago for the song ""Just Another Dream""; it brought back memories of when Dance music was actually music and not the processed, remixed trash that it's *generally* become today. I've found that I like most of this album, most notably ""All Night Long (Touch Me)"" and ""Got To Get Your Love"". (I feel that ""Too Many Walls"" didn't really belong on this album; it seemed very out of place on a dance album) Cathy Dennis is a talented singer/songwriter, and I am grateful to her for turning out one of the best dance albums of the 90's. Any fan of Dance music should give this album a try, if only to hear music one can actually dance to."
4,A great reference book for natural homekeeping,"I really enjoyed reading this book when it first arrived. It's simple and informative, laid out in the typical DK style - clean and uncluttered. However, I find that I continue to refer to it quite regularly as a reference guide. The homemade remedies, cleaning products, skincare etc are particularly useful. It's also packed with some eye-opening information about commonplace, everyday products.So, if you care about your health, the planet and what you bring into your home, this book is a really helpful companion."
5,Loved it!!,"I am a new fan and was introduced to the band from they're ""Pale"" song. I bought the CD after reading the reviews. It's a combination of Trans Siberian orchestra/Evanescence/rock. I really enjoyed it and would recommend it as a good addition to any CD collection."
3,Within Temptation - commercial??!!,"That's unfortunatelly true. Within Temptation sold their souls for money and this album shows it well :(Why are they now using that crapy electronic music like Evanescence ??!! It's %^%&.But there are some good points on this CD. Favs: Forsaken, Angels, Jillian and See who I'm. Those are REAL songs by Within Temptation and old fans should like them :)Instead of this album I'd recommend Mother Earth it's much superior to this new album."
2,"A notable attempt, but still a sell out","After WT dropped their growls and made 'Mother Earth', I thought this band had something going for them. But success always takes a toll. Please sample this album before wasting the time and money for so little return. Expect easy tunes, refrain repetition, synthesized voice, stupid lyrics, and the new pop culture look that goes with commercial sellouts.I feel rather guilty for trusting WT to master their potential, and can only imagine their first ex-fans as saying, ""Told ya so."""
3,"a lastest, catchy works from the Netherland metal fivesome.","European metal always have their very own style, and Within Temptation is not an exception, and this style is indeed keep rising over the globe... you might notice their influence on Evanescence's Fallen album, so if you like Fallen, you might want to listen to them, since they are just similiar outfit, metal riff, catchy melodies, and operatic vocal... but the fact that both the melodies and instrumentation are quite weak on ""Silent Force"", thru out the ablum is some typical Euro-metal riff and arrangement, a taste of greats like Therion and Lacrimosa. the vocal performance of Sharon sound very nice on this record, really show her talent and her opera and celtic influence as well.. I'd recommend ""See Who I Am"", ""Stand My Ground"", ""Forsaken"" will be some of the tunes that worth listening to."
3,Use of used books,". As far as the patterns and information in the book, it iswhat it says it is--use of chunky yarns. There are interesting styles several with cables, and markings as to whether it is easy, intermediate or experienced.Some are marked very easy, very vogue (the publisher) and those are first on my list."
1,Thank Good Mr. Neighbors was here,"I am a German collector and I collectas much PC Games as I can about the Theme:""The Southern War of Independence""Now I will spend no money For this game.Thank you..."
1,It is awful!,"I wish I had read the reviews before I purchased the item. Naughty on me! The game is awful. It crashes often, has no historical accuracy and is inoperable. Do not purchase this Rusky developed joke."
2,A bit of a let down,The 2 things I wanted from this tape were technical asects related to kata performance and realistic self-defense application. Neither was delivered. The quality of production is good and it does offer some value to anyone needing to understand the most basic application of some of the fundamentals and kata movement. Lack of applicability and detail make it an inferior source when compared to similar tapes with better content.
5,Good For Many Ages,"Grandma bought this for my daughter when she was about 6 months old. It was an instant favorite then and has continued to be one of our ""top 5"" most read books. As a baby, my daughter loved the rhyming text. When she began talking, she had fun first pointing to familiar objects and later naming what the bunnies were doing in the playground. Now, at 2, she loves counting the bunnies on each page as ""one more"" enters the playground. A fun game is to ask her to find the new bunny that was added. This has been a fun book and a really versatile teaching tool."
1,Never received my item after more than 1 month,The seller never sent the book even though she received payment. This seller is not very reliable buy from someone else.
4,a fine lost race novel,"This is one of ERB's lesser-known works but a worthwhile one nonetheless. It features the standard ERB storyline of a powerful hero who finds a princess to love and must fight all kinds of enemies to win her. It's full of bloodthirsty action, appalling acts of villainy (combined with a more complex antagonist than ERB usually provided), and thrilling acts of heroism. As with every ERB heroine, Fou-Tan is beautiful and desirable but holds herself in waiting for Gordon King, the hero of the tale. There's nothing new here, but readers who enjoy Burroughs' work and adventure-laden pulp fiction will enjoy it nonetheless."
4,"Another ""Walk Away Rene"" release","The ""Best of Orpheus"" CD contains a wonderful, almost choral arrangement of ""Walk Away Rene"" by a contemporary group whose compositions also demanded orchestration. Originally released within months of the Left Banke version, it was a very flattering compliment to Mike Brown by Orpheus leader,Bruce Arnold. Orpheus does not, however, sing the verses, just the choruses!"
2,Much Ado About Little,"I am stunned by the ridiculous prices being sought for this ""Anthology."" This set contains two and a half hits and a couple of solid B-sides - the rest sounds like every demo tape they ever made, all of which were quite reasonably rejected on the basis of poor songwriting, poor production, overuse of the harpsichord and string quartet, take your pick.Well, a fool and their money. . ."
1,Too Much Money,"I've never heard this album, but it can't be worth the price. I just can't see paying $100+ for a CD. I've seen the same thing with Poco's ""Blue and Gray"" CD. It's a great album, but everywhere I look they want at least $60 for the CD. I don't think so."
4,A group worth checking out,"This group was recommended to me by a friend who turned me on to a lot of obscure or semi-obscure 60's groups. He thought I was going to like them and he was right. Left Banke is in a similar vein to the Zombies in their mellower songs, only more baroque-oriented. This compilation is very generous and has several songs worth hearing. I especially like ""Walk Away Renee"", ""Pretty Ballerina"", ""Barterers and Their Wives"", ""Desiree"" and ""Goodbye Holly"". If you like 60's soft rock groups, like the Zombies and Association, you should definitely check Left Banke out."
3,Ok movie,"If you want to see something with a not too complex story line, some laughs, this is your movie."
4,Where the *%#! is Bruges?,"Overlooked indie gem with big name stars Colin Farell, Brendan Gleeson, & Ralph Fiennes as British gangsters NOT involved in a heist for once! A dark comedic look at morality, guilt, and forgiveness set in Belgium's ""storybook"" city. Recommended rental!"
5,bloody fantastic!,"The acting is superb, the dialogue is hilarious and the performance from Colin ferrel was indeed one of his best roles. It's an all around, well written screenplay. I wasn't sure what to expect. British humor is extremely side splitting. Watch this movie."
3,IN BRUGES IS BRILLIANT IN SURGES!,"'In Bruges' will not appeal to everyone, but it is brilliant at times. I found the film uneven, laughing hysterically one moment and bored to tears the next. This could have been due to the thick accent by the lead characters in the film being hard to understand sometimes. It's smart, funny and gruesome, but it's too long and has some very unnecessary scenes that took it down a few pegs in my book. If you liked this film you may like 'You Kill Me' which I thought was a better film than this."
2,Boring and Distasteful,"This is essentially a movie about people who are unpleasant and uninteresting, in which nothing of significance happens but in which there is plenty of violence. On the plus side the actors do sterling work with a third-rate script and Bruges itself is very pretty. On the minus side is the rest of the movie. If you are insensitive to pointless acts of violence and have an interest in the empty lives of small-time thugs, this is a great movie. Otherwise watching paint dry would be a more rewarding use of one's time."
1,"Horrid, gory, not funny, but lovely town","Read all the other one star reviews and I will just say "" ditto"" I wanted to like this movie after reading all the great reviews in various newspapers. The movie started with some clever off the wall banter between the 2 hit men sent to Bruges, but instead of remaining so, it quickly turned into a blatantly violent scattershot mess. The murder scenes were just too graphic to be considered dark humor. I agree with someone here who said it was completely unnecessary to show the killing of the child. This was really a bad and offensive movie, that veered screeching from strange dark humor to realistic bloodbaths. One star because despite it all, the actors and actresses were good and the DVD had some extras with interviews of the cast which were 100% better than the actual movie itself."
1,Do not waste your time with this film,I do not normally publish reviews about the dvd's I watch. This one however left me wanting someone had warned me about it.It is sad that good actors such as R. Fiennes would lend themselves to act in such a film. A tragic waste of a couple of hours...
4,Story Threads Immaculate,"I had often heard of the movie ""In Bruges,"" but happened upon it one day on a satellite movie channel. I do not frequently re-watch movies - much less also go on to purchase them. ""In Bruges"" contains fantastical insight into the ""conscience of hitmen."" Additionally, it is set in the spectacular location of Bruges, Belgium. The plot twists continue to the very end, when every story thread is neatly tied into a secure knot. Purchase this film. You will not be disappointed."
4,"Bruges, a fairytale-like place?",I caught the trailer for this film probably somewhere around a year ago at the theater and thought that the movie looked interesting but it didn't hit me as a must-see film at the time. After watching the movie I can tell the potential viewer that the trailer to this movie is misleading. I went into this movie very much expecting a comedy. But I would certainly say the dramatic elements of this film are more prevelant than the comedic ones.This film is more a character piece than anything else. When you watch this movie you will find a movie that analyzes psyches of men one of which is just entering the hitman business and another who is a veteran hitman.Watch this movie for the strong performances from all the actors and not for the action.
5,4.5 Revised Film Noir Quality With Appealing Honest Ambiguity,Darkly comic tale with a revised film noir quality about two gangsters hiding out In Bruge located in a gray area somewhere between black and white that provides the back drop for an honesty of gangsters knowing their gangsters American audiences can appreciate
1,Hose Melted When Doing Sealer Job,Worked for 30 minutes and then the hose melted throwing water proofing sealer every which way. I consider that dangerous. I'd give it no stars if that were an option. Need I say more?
5,Excellent,A great music product...with fresh song choices.Many songs I had never heard...but I really enjoyed them..a truly worthwhile purchase for the old..as well as the young..Enjoy
5,Interesting and Informative,"As an MCSD, I have struggled to get my hands around all of the concepts involved in C++. After multiple classes and hours in training, I was refereshed to read this book which integrates intuitive knowledge, simple instructions and SUCCESSFUL C++ programming. Well Done to Mr. Simon and Mr. Schmidt!"
4,Superior Customer Service,I bought the Pack Rack system for this year's hunt because the mounts are easy to remove when hauling other supplies to our campsite. I was very disappointed when the rubber mount broke off from the stem after only two days of moderate trail riding. I emailed the company and they were absolutely awesome. They shipped out two new mounts immediately so now I have a spare. That is great customer service. You can trust this company to support their product!
4,great product,"This is one ofthe best bras I own. In terms of support/holding your breast in place, nothing beats it. I will reccommend to anyone. It is not the best lingere piece though."
5,comfortable bra,This bra fits true to size and is comfortable. I was able to find this via the id number on the tag of my old bra. Thank you Amazon for making searching for items easy and having a better price!
3,Not as good a fit as the the Beige version,This one did not fit as well as the beige one I purchased. A bit tighter around the back and cup not a full
3,Pointy Boobs and Itchy Fabric,Pointy boobs and somewhat itchy fabric. That's what you'll get. The lining of the bra is also a bit oddly done and strangely cut at the back. Good support though. And worth it for under $10 if you are mainly looking for an inexpensive bra that functions properly.
2,am not allowed to send back,The bra is pretty but I just cant wear underwires. They won't take product back as it is a undergarment...wish I would have known that before I spent money on it!
5,Excellent support,The Bali flower is my favorite bra. Why? The support is excellent! I have bought a few flower Bali bras and I plan to buy a few more so DON'T STOP MAKING them!
4,GOOD FIT FOR ME,"I WAS NOT ABLE TO FIND DESIRED COLOR CHOICES, POO. THIS STYLE WORKS FOR ME, BUT WHO WANTS A WARDROBE OF WHITE BRAS; MORE COLOR CHOICES PLEASE!"
5,Their Best One Yet,"This CD is awesome. From begining to end it combines meaningful lyrics with intense music. Bring this CD into the weight room and you can guarantee results, forget steriods, all you need is 98 Mute."
3,It isn't bad,This is an Ok album. One thing you can say about it is that a lot of the songs sound a little to much alike. This music isn't bad if you like punk but it can get you a little wanting some variety. Each song has good lyrics to go with it so that is a plus. And each song has a good length. This album is pretty good but it leaves a little to be desired. Buy it if you like Pennywise.
4,Great southern rock...the Headhunters never disappoint,Greg Martin has some of the best Les Paul into Marshall amp tones anywhere. I buy the albums just for that!
5,I just can't stop laughing!,"This is an excellent and amusing book, displaying the author's ability at wordplay in two languages. Even with a minimal knowledge of French the book is easily understandable. The German version is even better: Morder Guss Reims: The Gustav Leberwurst manuscript, by John Hulme : 6 out of 5 for this one!"
2,Cast is all wrong,Much like The Mystery Begins the cast is all wrong. The actor who plays Shaggy never gets the voice right and Fred has dark hair. Daphne just does not have the right spunk that Sarah Michelle Gellar gave to the role and Velma is flat. Too bad.
1,Scooby Doo: Curse of the Lake Monster,We love Scooby-Doo...But this was horrible. The acting was really bad. Freddie was a brunette...what's up with that?...Freddie has always been a blond. All the costuming looked horrible including Shaggy's hair. I give this a one star because there was nothing lower. I would suggest renting it before purchasing it.
1,scooby doo pew whew,"first off i thought this would be a great new movie boy was i wrong .first i would talk about the characters fred ,daphen ,velma ,shaggy and scooby doofred sucked and what is up with the black hair fred hair is blonde.daphen sucked as well first off she didn't even act like her character suppose to.shaggy sucked as well what is with the hair ?velma was the only one who stuck to her character beside scooby doo .scooby doo they making him look lighter in ever movie it seem to me .for my opinion this was the worst scooby doo movie ever why are they tring to change a great thing when they got it stick to the original themewhy bring them dating come on it a kid show so stick to what everyone loves.i like it when these character played the partsmatthew lillard as shaggymindy cohn as velmathat just my thoughts...."
1,Poorly done,"The movie is a failure! Actors are the same like from the previous movie and I don't like them. They don't fit with their fake looks and their acting. The CGI(animated) dog is bad, and humor is low. If I was in the movie, I'd never show my face in the public and never would go by the same name as in the credits. That was 1 hour and 22 minutes of a true waste of time. I doubt the money they earned from the previous movie was actually spend on the making of this movie. But the good part is that frog mutants at least looked O.K. and much better than the dog. I had no idea the movie would be so bad. It is not interesting and I consider it as a fail, because it delivers none of the good things from the cartoons."
5,Plus One Rocks,"The Promise reveals tremendous vocal talent with a message. With 12 songs on the CD there wasn't one song I wanted to skip. This is the best ""boy band"" sound I have heard. It's a project all ages will enjoy."
4,The Promise plus one,"I like the songs but, I felt I was waiting for a love song I guess they sound too much as a rock group that kids listen to now. I guess that is the selling catch. But the songs were GREAT."
2,+1isokay,Plus one is pretty good the first time you listen to it but after a while the beat and stuff gets to repetitave and it gets annoying to listen to.
4,Awesome,Great alternative for lighting and half the price of what you'll pay in furniture stores. Instructions were not incredibly easy to understand though.
3,Poor tolerances,"The lamp was well packaged and the spare bulb and glass cylinder were nice in case of breakage. However this is actually the first hint of poor quality control. The tolerances of the angled bases is poor and the lamp posts interfere with each-other making assembly quite difficult. One of the bulb terminals had a stripped screw and had been crushed-in a little during manufacturing. The instructions are near useless as well. After about 20 minutes of trial and error I was able to get the lamp assembled based on a better picture found through Google. The lamp's final appearance is more than worth it's price but the actual quality is NOT there. Thankfully it only needs to be assembled once.****(HINT: To others trying to assemble: with the cord on your right, the longest cylinder should be in front, the middle length on your right, closest to the cord, and the shortest on your left on the far side away from the cord. You WILL need to push a little on each cylinder to get them assembled.)"
4,lamp,"Nice lamp. Easy to assemble (5 minutes). The lamp also arrived with an extra globe and bulb...nice touch. The switch is a rheostat on the cord. The dimmer is nice, but would have been more useful if it were on the lamp base. Good quality. Quick ship and good packaging. Arrived undamaged. Very modern looking and with high intensity bulbs if the dimmer is all the way up, very bright, lots of light."
2,Meh.,"This lamp is awesome looking--very visually attractive!However, like other buyers, I found the assembly instructions to be less than helpful. And when I did put it together, I found that the bulbs only work when they want to which I find super inconvenient. If I'm reading in bed, and the bulbs decide to go out, I'm left with nothing. There's a slight buzzing sound coming from my lamp, too.Overall, I would probably not recommend this lamp."
3,Nice pictures,This books offers some very nice pictures of bears and their habitat but little information on bears themselves. It is a nice addition to a collection but not a book with any new information.
4,Another Winner,"Let me say first, I love Mariah Stewart. I'll read absolutely anything she writes, and I devoted the better part of an entire afternoon to 'Voices Carry'. After enjoying 'Brown Eyed Girl' as much as I did, I couldn't wait to get my hands on this one to see how Genna and John's story would continue. There was lots of action here and a few twists I never even suspected. Thats the great thing about Ms. Stewart - she keeps you guessing !I thought 'Voices' had just the right blend of suspense and mystery and, of course, romance. Ms. Stewart writes characters you just can't help rooting for. It might be good to read 'Brown Eyed Girl' first just to get a feel for the characters, but 'Voices' will stand proud all on its own. And while you're shopping, if you happen to see any other books by Mariah Stewart - grab 'em! You won't be dissappointed !"
2,VERY disappointed!,"I enjoy thrillers. Given all the hoopla about Ms. Stewart's previous book, I picked this up with a tingle of anticipation. Boy, did that fade quickly!Her writing isn't that good, and the FBI -- including the unbelievably mixed-up hero and heroine -- came off looking like a bunch of stupid amateurs. The last third of the book would've never happened, since the investigators would've homed in on the location of the abducted women right away. I got the sense that the contrived ending was just so the heroine could be placed in jeopardy One More Time.I've read a lot of great romantic suspense, BLIND FAITH by Christianne Heggan leaps to mind, and this falls far short of ""good."" I may look for her previous title in a used book store, but I won't pay money for it."
4,Nice music peeks out from behind vintage technology,"All the tunes are nice, and varied.Ensemble with chorus/male singer/female singer, ensemble instrumental.Interesting aray of instruments.The singers/instrumentalists have all honed their talents well, and sound steeped in their culture.Though the cd is obviously transfered from LP (which may put some listeners off), there are no gliches that 'jump' at you (eg.one track louder than another, electrical 'ticks', etc...).It has a consistency all thru.(thats why I thought '3-stars' would be harsh)They did an even job with the technology they had."
2,Please enter a title for your review,"half of odious mortem's stuff is the same rudimentary muted powerchord/single non-muted note back and forth all the lame metalcore bands do. the ""technical"" aspect is just a juvenile rejection of compositional flow. starting a new half-riff every 5 seconds is the opposite of complex. it's called jamming or messing around, it's what songwriters do before they commit to a particular riff and then build more stuff onto it. i'd call them a metal jam-band but they're anything but tight. the drummer and guitarist are both more interested in personal showboating than in complimenting what each other are playing."
2,"Worth the price, but not much information","This appears to be a good little reference for getting vendor links as to where to purchase inexpensive promotion-related-web services for the do-it-yourself-er. My reading is that the author has tried many of these services, and offers some tips on which ones are qualified.It is not much of a book though, as its 100 pages can easily be compacted to 50, since the publisher uses double and triple line spacing. It's not an introduction for the beginner because it's too skimpy. A beginner is probably best served by first reading other books about promotions and then gathering tips from this book on how to cut costs. The techniques presented are accurate and elementary."
4,Good Collection,"Due to the fact that Tull music is becoming increasingly hard to find,this set does showcase some of the band's best work and certainly the best known material.It's a shame that a group who's music was so influential and so popular,won't be available for a new generation of intelligent rockers!"
3,WEIRD BAND..,"I had never listened to TULL before, which was a sin for a rock fan as myself. So, I decided to start by buying this compilation, knowing fully well that compilations never are really good, the songs seem out of connection. So, my opinion was: the first CD is absolutely unhearable to me, because I was born more in 80's rock (even loving AC/DC, Zeppelin and even Kiss and Genesis), but I thought the recording very poor (technically speaking) and didn't really liked the vocals. In the second CD I liked it at once, much more virtuosity and good songs. Anyway, to a band last so long (even with numberless changes in line-up) it must have something very good."
4,wonderful girls' book,"This is the first book in the Ginnie series, I believe.The first Ginnie book I read was ""Ginnie and her Juniors"" which I devoured in the fourth grade. I loved it so much, I didn't bother getting into the other ones. It wasn't until I was a young adult that I thought I would check out the others, just out of curiosity. I read this one and I thought it was very good. I imagine if I had read it as a kid, I would have adored it and learned so much. Woolley has a way of teaching kids good social skills without being preachy or condesending. I heard that she died this week at the age of 100. What a legacy she left behing. She also wrote under the name Jane Thayer. You may want to check out her Gus the ghost books, that are geared for younger kids-ages 4-7. Teachers, do your girl students a favor and introduce them to these classics! I agree with all the others who say Woolley's books should come back in print!"
4,Great choice for our needs!,"Really glad that a manufacturer finally thought to expand it's absorbent material to minimize leaking diapers. I have tried so many for my disabled son and ALWAYS experienced failure daily from others I have tried, especially when he is laying down. These are great!!! Rarely are the leaks now and though I have to add a insert pad on the side of the diaper when he sleeps (he likes to lay on his side) the diapers usually hold it all in for the night. I highly recommend this product!! The delivery was also well done. Thank you KENDALL!!"
5,Great product from a great vendor,Bought this product at a great low price from Domo Home prodcuts had it in 2 days and when I did not know how to install I called and they walked me through installation. Great price and great service!
2,Not that scary to be a evil spirit,"In the begginig it keeps you in suspense when a security guard knows about something evil is trapped behind a wall which noises comes out.People come to this building that's abandoned and one of them release this evil spirit and starts killing.Some scenes with some special effects are not that bad.The problem with this movie when the evil spirit gets in a form of a person,he's not scary at all.I really didn't enjoy it that much,doesn't mean it's that bad,i seen worst.Probally it's a movie you want to see one time and never again."
3,Visually stunning but lacking,This three part Ova is a compilation of traditional and computer animation that is absolutely stunning. With a heavy surrealist hand they paint a gothic lolita (horror fantasy) ghost story of romance and bloody sacrifice. However that's sort of all you're getting. The concept of self sacrifice in this movie is like Romeo and Juliet on Speed. The plot is thin and most of the time goes no where. The story line seems to exist merely as a vessel for the art. If you think Dali and his ilk are pretentious or just plain bad this might not be the flick for you.
1,Poor product,"This product does not catch more than a few flies per strip. I have seen flies land on it, struggle for a second, and fly away. This is an exceptionally poor product."
1,don't be fooled......,".... contains little of value. you believe that by purchasing this item that you will have access to the MUSTER ROLLS .... indeed, that is what appears on the cover of the CD. in fact this is a $40 index! there is no information to this effect anywhere, and to make matters worse there is no ""consolation prize"" for having wasted your money (i.e., you can actually see the muster rolls if you go to washington, petition the national archives, or whatever). borderline misrepresentation."
5,A League Even I Forgot About,"I was in college when the WBL existed - I remember we used to talk about going to see a game when we were home on semester break in D.C. but we never got around to it. The biggest game of the year was always when ODU and Lieberman and Nissen would come to maul our womens team - the gym was packed to beyond capacity and always outdrew the mens game. This is an interesting read with all the funny and poignant stories of a league's startup and also some sad stories, too - well worth it."
5,This Cd is amazing,"I really like this album and i think that NOFX just keeps on getting better and better with every album. The only thing they could have done was either inculde more songs or make the songs on the album longer. I like the songs ""Bottles to the Ground"" Herojuana, and Dinosaurs will die"
5,Punk Rock Is Officially Elite,"Pump Up The Valium is definitely the best of the year so far. It's classic NoFX for you. The thumping bass, Fat Mike's angst-filled vocal, and as always, the hilarious lyrics. The bass here is more noticible than before, but the guitar still shines through. Every song is great, and this is the best melodic punk I've heard from NoFX since the Ribbed album. My favorite songs out of the bunch are What's The Matter With Parents Today?, Thank God It's Monday, and Theme From A NoFX Album. I strongly recommend it."
4,My Dad is a member of the group,my father was a memember of this group his name is neamen howard and my uncle kyre was in it 2.They are still in the music biz.working with other people
4,Inside a climbers head,"I was surprised by the openness of David Roberts book. The first that I've read of his works, it revealed what a climber thinks before, during, and after a climb, regardless of its technical difficulty. I found the feelings of climber's spouses, immediate family, and friends to be contradictory, yet aligned in an odd fashion. I thought that Roberts was brave, not only in his climbing, but in sharing his intimate feelings with the world.Roberts' book also took me into the world of higher education, revealing the politics and how many administrators are stuck in stupid mode.Despite the descriptive nature of the book, I still wish there were photographs in the book to help me visualize the book's many characters. Roberts' vocabulary helped me to expand mine, as I frequently sought out the dictionary."
1,Doesn't deserve one star,"This is the first review I have ever submitted. I have read over a hundred books about mountaineering but I must say this is the worst. He should have named the book ""me me me"". I have never read a more egotistical writer. Anyone giving him a 5 star rating must be related."
3,"Not the best W&G, but still amazing claymation.","""Grand Day Out"" explores Wallace's fascination with cheese. It is not the best of the three currently available (the story isn't quite as compelling as ""Trousers"" and ""Shave""), but still very good claymation. Probably more appealing to younger children."
4,Things start out nicely. Then it just becomes a big gilgamesh.,"Classic tale of two BFFs. The end was very abrupt in this version, Noah has a cameo which is cool."
5,impressed by the instrumental talent,"Wasn't sure what to expect, but was pleasantly pleased with the renditions of LBT songs and great instrumental - easy listening."
5,The best just got even better!,"Having only been a Dwight fan for a few years and lucky enough to have seen him live..this is the closest, next best thing, perhaps even a little better. His voice is such a major presence, you cant be anything less than enthralled while hearing him utilize that talent/gift; his voice just bears into your soul! Add the acoustic guitar and he absolutely just brings the songs he chose, to life. This CD no doubt, lets all of Dwights talent be on the surface ...voice and guitar; it's pure Dwight and pure talent!"
5,Are you kidding me? Some of the best music on planet earth,"If you're a fan of acoustic, and even if you're not, I'd say this is a must have. 25 songs of just Dwight. Good, good stuff, Maynard. Downhome, simple, folksy music . One song is a capella, most are just him and his guitar, and a couple-few have some additional minimal acoustic accompaniment. Too bad I couldn't find it on Google music, but bought it here and gonna transform it to mp3 and my phone, of course. Great music from one of the best timeless voices out there."
5,Excellent,"Unlike the previous reviewer, I HAVE heard this album and I think it is wonderful. The previous reviewer did not take the time to understand what the album is all about. It is not a greatest hits album! Dwight reinvents some of his old songs with only his voice and guitar. All of the emphasis on these songs are on Dwight's lyrics and voice. No other guitars; No drums; no back-up singers! It's just wonderful. True fans of Dwight will love this CD."
5,"Wonderful, Beautiful, Raw Dwight!","I have all of Dwight's CDs and I think that this might just be my favorite. There is not a song I don't enjoy listening to. THIS IS ""RAW"" DWIGHT! His powerful voice really comes through on this CD. I like the fact that it is all acoustic. If you don't get this one, you are missing out!"
5,Incredible music!,"Everything Dwight has ever recorded has been, to say the least, awesome. He has so much musical talent and it really shines through on this bare bones album. With every song you can feel the emotion through Dwight's beautiful voice and guitar playing. The man is truly talented! Take it from a true fan; any money spent on Dwight's recordings is money well spent! With over 70 minutes of acoustic songs full of soul and emotion, this CD is truly a great deal!"
3,Big dissapointment,I have been a Dwight Yoakam fan for many years but this cd was a big dissapointment. Everyone has their own idea of what he was trying to do here but I don't think even he knew. His voice works well with a full backup but there is nothing even mildly entertaining here. My curiosity has been satisfied and I'll probably never give it another listen.
4,"Outstanding, Objectively","I'd like to chime in here as well. ""Phoenix"" is a superb pop-jazz-fusion album, far too joyous for the death-watching crowd that got a stiffy from ""Creatures."" A beautiful record with wonderful songs. I don't understand why people forced Ronny to go full-on deathwave- CoX always explored deep souls that were quite capable of seeing the beauty in life."
2,A very poor showing,Ah yes the nightmare Ronny Moorings doesn't want to see or hear of again. I can understand - this is dreadful stuff. Well OK I'm being a bit cruel. But the songs sound so tuneless that it's horrible to believe that this is the same band who would make A Day and Your Vice - then again I suppose technically it's not since the band has changed many times. I think this must be the point where Anka moved out and Mojca came in on the next album. But there tends to be a total lack of depth in the music ( I was going to say originality but even at their greatest Xymox were never the most original in terms of music but were enjoyable ).You probably have to be an utter diehard to enjoy this at all. But then maybe all Xymox fans are a little diehard
3,Charming,Nice family movie!!! This movie shows how you can be in trouble and correct your mistakes to avoid harming others.
2,Disappointing,"When we opened the box (which is a normal game-sized box), we were a little surprised to see that there was nothing in it but a DVD and a couple of cheap pairs of 3D glasses. We were even more surprised when, after putting in the DVD to check it out, we discovered that you didn't even need the 3D glasses to make out the word on the TV screen. It is easily readable without the glasses. Kind of makes the whole thing a waste if everyone cn see the word, don't you think?"
2,Not her best,"Smith rehashes plot themes of her A Place to Call Home, a much sweeter, more believable romance, in this novel."
4,A Great Book!,A book hasn't touched me to the point of crying in a long time. This book has really complex characters & stories. If you are looking for a few hours of really pleasurable reading this is it. I didn't want it to end. A multi-generational story that hooked me from the first. The author made me care so much for the characters I was wondering what happened to everyone once the story ended.
4,Four Stars,"The Stone Flower Garden: A Novel is a wonderful book by Deborah Smith. The plot of the book is typical Smith: girl and boy meet at a young age...boy and girl get seperated at a young age...and meet again when they are adults and reconnect emotionally and romantically. Sounds simplistic but Smith is, as with TSFG, always able to make you see beyond the prediction by creating appealing characters through impressive writing."
2,Bad Mario Game???,I remember seeing a preview for this game and thinking that this game was going to be like the pokemon pinball games but with better graphics but when i put this game into my gameboy advance i was shocked by how bad it was. The real problem with the game is that the level desigen is very un inspired and its so easy for you to die because of the level lay out. Also its just not that fun of a pinball game. Hopefully Nintendo will learn from there mistakes and actually a good pinball game next time*PS* If you are looking for a good pinball game check out Kirby's Pinball for the original gameboy. While it might not look better than this game its the best pinball game EVER!!!
2,Mario Pinball,I love playing Mario games so bought this one. I find it a very hard game to play and losing interest in it. I have beat one boss is about all. Very easy to lose your Marioball down the drain. Doubt I will finish it.
4,I LIKE!!!!,"Only comment I have about the game is saving your scores. That sucks when you reach over 1,000,000 points and you die and you can't save your progress. The graphics are really cute."
1,As the others said it's true will not stay up on your knee!!!,Very disappointing but true it would not stay up on my knee I would put it as tight as possible and it would be down around my ankle after a minute or two so I returned it!
1,Misrepresents level of support,"Despite the description, it not prevent or even inhibit twisting or side-to-side bending, because the metal in it is coiled wire -- very flexible."
2,NO NO,If you are going to buy this you might as well get a second play yard...I did not notice a big difference with this...I don't believe it is as much square feet as they say....hmmm
4,"Like the panels, but NO INSTRUCTIONS","The extender panels arrived without instructions. It took me about 1/2 an hour to figure out how to add them, and I am usually pretty good with item assembly. I recommend buying two or three extender panel kits if you have a small child because they will need room in which to move around. Also, the panels aren't as see-thru as the picture would have you believe, so children really cannot see you very well through the panels (I am the mother of an 8 month old girl and she cries if she can't see me)."
2,Does not Fit,Summer Infant Secure Surround Playsafe Playard is not a fit for this product. Do not buy these panels thinking they fit even though they say they do. I do like how this product is more sturdy than our play pen. Looks like a good product if it fit our play area.
4,Set your sights on this old classic,"Am glad to see this old American Heritage Junior Library book in a reprint addition - it's a classic.As other reviewers have pointed out, the writing is particularly clear and well-structured, but I would like to call to attention that the book contains great illustrations by war artists such as Peter Hurd, Floyd Davis, John Lavalle, et. al.Whether you pick up the new addition or find a dog-eared original copy at a yard sale, Air War Against Hitler's Germany is a good introduction to the subject."
4,"Different City, Same Game","I've been playing this game for a week and a few days now. It's just as addictive as Busting Out (GBA) was, but it's pretty much the same game, plus or minus a few minor things. Rep points are a strange thing, and I've found that they don't really contribute to gameplay. A few of the challenges are harder than they were in Busting Out, and I've also found that your Urb will continue to fulfill motives even after the bar is full.It isn't a bad game, but I was expecting more."
3,"Okay, this isn't the sims but still fun...","Let's start with FYI I may be 11 years old but am not stupid and you SHOULD read this review because it's useful and not dumb.Okay let's crack down to business:Pros:lots of charactersapartments are pretty niceits funyou get paid quite alot if you have at least 4 body pointsCons:No marriage, whoohoo, kids etc.After you finish it you have no moral intrest in it anymoreFor the dumb mind its hardYes, for dumb people it's hard...no offense......I finished the game....I do sort of have the urge not to trade it in and still kind of live there>?The PS2 version is no better and I can say worse. This game doesn't need a walkthrough but if your haing trouble then I would suggest because Glasstown is the best! THe PS2 versions having beens getting very bad lately...not the point.Overall I suggest buying this game because you'll have a lot of fun.Well, happy simming!"
1,Had to stop reading it,"It was that boring! I usually don't even give up on books, but this one was an exception. Ellen was one of those classic tomboys who just wants to like her daddy and grandpa. How original is that. She just happens to also live on a ranch where she just acts like the real cowboy. Wow. I'm not saying that Ellen couldn't be that way, but she could of been less one-dimensional (just like many of the other characters in SURVIVAL! and American Diaries, the latter not as much). Her Grandpa gets hurt so she has to think up some crazy plan using all these ranch equipment pieces that people from the nineties could really care less about. The description where she was trying to move her grandpa (about five million chapters long) drove me so crazy I just had to stop. Try reading one of the first American Diaries books, they have more on the character of the person and less historical mumbo jumbo (and don't get me wrong, I love history!)"
2,It is an obscure training guide,"This book was of no use to me. It is difficult to follow, it does not provide an easy way to figure out what do you need to do for all the sections required in an APA style paper. And then if you had the time to do what this book say you first would have do a ""test"" on what you know. And then ""attempt"" to use this book to craft your own paper is another challenge. Maybe this books needs another book to explain its use. I found that it is easier to use the APA manual itself.I would not buy this book if I had another chance."
2,Awful,"This book helped me so little it wasn't worth the price, any price, to purchase it. It's confusing and hard to read. Yuch!"
4,Dobermann is wacky,"The movie has an ok plot, but what keeps this movie exciting are the stylish action sequences (this movie was one of the pioneers in the use of the bullet time effect used on The Matrix) . Get ready to watch Yann Le Pentec aka Le Dobermann ooze coolness. A perfect example of style over substance."
4,Great Action Flicks,These are some of the best action movies ever created. This is a great deal for anyone who loved the old action movies.
1,Lethal Weapon Was to have been SteelBook,I purchased this Lethal Weapon BluRay Collection from you because on the main page it said Steel Book.I didn't get the Steel Book but the reg. blu ray collection. I paid 10.00 more for it than I had to pay from anyone else because it said steel book. I will never purchase anything else from you. I am very upset.
2,"cheesy, but not fun","The Lethal Weapon movies may have been appealing to action fans many years ago, but honestly, look at them. Do you think they aged well? I don't. They are SO cheesy that it makes my head hurt watching them. They are sort of overrated too. Even back in the day they were overrated.Well, if you like action films, this may or may not be worth investing."
1,im tired ofthese foolz,man lil jon and all those be gettin on my nerves and this song yeah the video has sum fit women but the lyrics and beats are wack dont listen to it!
5,"""Taking it back to the Old-Skool!!""","This CD here is one of the first ever of the ""Old-Skool"" Hip-hop compilations to be put on CD and one of the best. Classic, obscure Hip-Hop rarities is all you're going to get here. The underground classics of '79-'81, the best Rap era EVER!! A must have!"
1,dislike,My class has started for a whileC Have not received the book yet.Do not recommend!Hope I can get the book as soon as possible.
5,Buy this CD,"Where their first album was good, it never quite got off the ground. Not so with Trickle. This album incorporates electronic sounds into classical and pop styles, making it enjoyable for even the strict top-40 fan. You'll find yourself with many of the tunes stuck in your head after the first listen and an urge to play the CD non-stop. With this album, Olive is a major player in the evolution of music in the U.S."
2,unsatisfied,"I'm a little unsatisfied about their second album. meanwhile their first album was much more interesting, this one pleases with mass audience. And forgive me I say that, but the guitars on these tracks are not necessairy. Is it because they produced the album in the states? American productions deal with guitars all the time. why?"
2,Disappointing 'everything but the girl' rip-off,"Despite being praised widely in the media, Olive are very dull! This CD limps along at a very slow pace with cliched songs and generic beats. Only their classic cover of 'I'm not in love' shows any shine. I rarely write bad music reviews, but this CD was a disappointment. Buy everything but the girl's 'Walking wounded' instead."
1,completely disappointed,"After lovingly and repeatedly listening to ""Extra Virgin,"" I was completely taken aback by their vapid and styleless follow-up record ""Trickle."" And also very surprised to log on here and find such generous reviews from other listeners. Did no-one see the difference in quality here? Perhaps it's due to a different producer (which they must have had with the switch of record labels), but where are all the little drum and bass details from Extra Virgin that are lost here? This is what separated Olive from the the host of other electronica groups with pop crossover written all over their debut albums. The only thing that saves this record is Ruth Ann's vocals, which are, for the most part, submerged beneath an unaccentuated wash of keyboards with no distinguishable melody. And for a great version of ""I'm Not In Love,"" check out the Pretender's version, which has a terrific vocal, and a subtle backing track that isn't lost in post-production."
5,Thought provoking,"A rather slow paced movie, which does not take us wherw we want to go, but a truly emotionable film that is finely crafted by a great cast and crew. Up there with my very favourites."
2,Not very stable,"I bought two of these for my twin girls (2 yrs. old). While the color and Dora picture make it a pretty looking chair, it is not stable at all. When my daughters were climbing in and out it continuously collapsed. Causing them to fall. Also the rivits that are used to attach the legs to the black plastic feet are very loose. Making me think they will break fairly easy. The cup holder is also very small. It could not fit a regular sippy cup. For the same price you can find far better quality and also chairs that have some kind of a locking feature in back to prevent the chairs from collapsing.I have returned these chairs."
4,The Dora Cahir,"This char is just like any canvas fold up chair,only smaller. I bought it for my daughter and she absolutely loves it. More importantly it makes her feel like one of the gang when she can use her chair at gatherings, just like the grown ups."
1,Tribute?,"This can'tpossible be a tribute. The YYY's songs are trashed, spit on! There's only one good cover, the New York No Stars'. The song, ""Remembering Love"" is good too, though it's not a cover.I can't believe how horrible this CD is. Don't buy it! Not even used!Amazingly bad. It's like someone wanting to draw your portrait, but instead you get a caricature. A bad one. A really, really bad one."
5,Betrayal of Innocence : Incest and Its Devastation,"This book is very well written and helped me through a tough period in my life when I read it in the 80's. I had been having flashbacks and decided to see if I could figure out what was going on. It provided me with a blueprint and a course of action, which helped me find myself and do something about what had happened to me. I would recommend this book to any victims of childhood sexual abuse."
5,Stands The Test Of Time,"The complete record of Christian 7th Day Sabbath keeping, from the earliest Church Age till modern times. A time tested doctrine, with over 100 languages throughout the world refering to Saturday as literally Sabbath. Excellent Biblical and historical references to the 1st century Church keeping the day refered to in the Ten Commandments as the ""seventh day"". Also documents the gradual traditional transfer of Sabbath keeping, to worshiping on Sunday. A classic on the subject."
1,Unhealthy/poor choice toy for a child,"Based on much research, this toy happens to be a poor choice toy for a child.Reasons: Encourages children to have babies at young age, makes it look easy and fun having a baby; this set comes with only a mother and child, and no father for the child.An unhealthy choice.Sighned,Cherry Trip."
2,Caution with P & B copies,"After posting a note in this section over a year ago, I received a note from someone in New York who had a copy they wanted to sell for a rather significant price.Turned out to be a very poor copy. Be careful that you are getting an original instead of a third or fourth generation copy.bill domb"
2,Someone has to know where we can get the movie version!!!!,"I remember watching it on TV years ago(early 70's) as a child and now no one can find a copy? To all you TV and Motion picture exec's: You stand to make big $$ if you can find the film version and sell video tapes. Please help!!!! We all miss watching the film version w/Sammy Davis, Dorothy Dandridge, and Sidney Poitier."
4,Porgy & Bess,"I shared this video with about 10 people in my opera club. Everyone loved the performance. The only problem was we could not understand what they were saying, so we had to used the sub."
1,Another person longing for the original!,"I was overwhelmed by the no. of people who have longed for the original movie, just like me and feel that any other production pales in comparison. My parents played the music as I grew up and I never did get to see the movie (I am 48). I have had the Samuel Goldwyn Meyer Co. write to me yrs ago that the movie is tied up in his estate, and a movie channel wrote me that the film's condition has caused the delay. Hard to know what to believe, but if anyone hears of a release/copies available I would be grateful to know. Vicki at:[e-mail]com"
2,Good... But NOT the 'real' Porgy and Bess I remembered.,"Sidney...? Are you there...!!! Where can I get the 'Porgy and Bess' Musical and was with my grandmother in early 50's. Sidney Poitier, Sammy Davis Jr., all the greats.... PLEASE anyone give me a call (707-994-0508) or email me."
4,Great Until the End,"Very high production values and if you enjoy Porgy and Bess it is a good choice. Until the end.Sorry, but Porgy throwing down his crutches to set off walking to New York is not how the opera is supposed to end. Porgy's main mode of transportation is supposed to be a goat cart. He can NOT use his legs! In the end it is how he is setting off to New York.The book Porgy ends with Maria watching Porgy leave on his goat cart to New York and for the first time realizing that Porgy is an old man.If you are going to produce a quality performance of a classic, then stick to the intended ending; don't throw in your own ""uplifting"" ridiculous conclusion!"
3,REMEMBERING PORGY AND BESS,"AS A YOUNG GIRL I SAW THIS MOVIE SEVERAL TIMES AND I LOVED THE SINGING ESPECIALLY.I DO HOPE IT IS TRUE AND THE MOVIE WILL BE OUT ON DVD.I WILL BUY A DVD FOR THIS VIDEO. I WOULD LIKE FOR MY CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN TO SEE THIS EXTRAORDINARY FILM. I LOVED THE PART OF PORGY SINGING ""BESS YOU IS MY WOMAN NOW"".SPORTIN LIFE WAS A TRUE SHYSTER.SAMMY DAVIS JR. PLAYED THE PART TO A ""T""."
4,Original Porgy and Bess,"The original 1950's Porgy and Bess was the very first musical I ever saw, and it was fantastic. I have now tried without success to get a copy of this original film. I have the Glyndebourne DVD, but it is not in my opinion as good as the original. I really would like to find out if there are any copies of the 1950's film available, can you help? please."
4,HOTS....Susan Kiger!,"HOTS - Help Out The Seals.....uh huh....two Words- Susan Kiger!! I remember her from her Playboy pictorial, January 1977....W-O-W! Her scenes are worth the price alone....and the football game...!! Yes, it's all great fun....! recommend this film for a silly, sexy diversion from life's trials and tribulations."
2,What a Waste!,"I bought this video expecting lots of topless scenes and slapstick comedy. I got very little of either. I first read about this movie in Maxim's best ""B"" movies and it said it had topless skydiving, sunbathing, etc. There is a topless skydiver but she is in the air and the camera is on the ground so you can't see anything. I am fan of those movies from the good ol' 70s with big racks, but this is garbage. The scene where Danny Bonaduche (spelling?) cant get it up is an instant classic of how not to act. Topless football game is very short and not worth the money."
4,Nostalgia Trip,"HOTS was exactly as I remembered it. I hadn't seen this movie for many years, but I was still familiar with the story line. For some reason I also got this movie confused with another similar movie called ""Squeeze Play"" which came out around the same time. At any rate, I enjoyed watching this movie from my juvenile past. Wish I could be more informative, but I gotta get some rest. Perhaps, I'll add more later(?)"
2,extra tracks worthless,Make no mistake this is a Great Album. You see why Julian left Teardrop Explodes. The album sounds fantastic after the re-master but the 2nd disc is worthless. A lot of dub tracks and instrumentals. Where are the thought out tracks that were left out. Oh I guess there were none
4,Very good.,"This is a focused little listen, and a move away from what they did on ""Dots and Loops"" and ""Cobra Phases."" They've moved forward again, but are revisiting old sounds too."
4,predictable reviewers,"Another good release from Stereolab. I don't think their later music is as predictable as the cynical opinions that I encounter from frequent audients. The days of low-fi Stereolab are over. Who cares? The later albums are all really good, intelligent music, and contrary to what some say, I wouldn't characterize them as lounge music or jazz. I recommend active listening, though--I don't get much from the music if I am focusing my attention on other things while it's playing."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS EDITION,"This a terrible edition of Joyce's first published book. The binding is flimsy, and the book is poorly put together. Many of the poems are not properly printed--for example, most of poems appear in paragraph form! Don't waste your money on it."
5,truly a great product!!,"I am constantly getting motion sickness. I've tried everything to help relive me of the nausea that I get whenever I get into a moving vehicle: ginger slices, peppermint tea, sprite... you name it! Eaters Digest never fails to either completely cure or dramatically decrease any and all sorts of nausea. If you go to Elliotts Natural Foods, it's only about $6, I've also seen it at Raleys. I absolutely believe that EVERYONE needs this tea in their pantry!"
3,"Good info about paints, but how do I paint my boat?","The author covers the conventional paints, epoxys, polyeurethanes, gelcoats, solvents, safety, primers, painting on various surfaces, possible problems you may encounter with poor preparation, and discusses proper temperatures and humidity. The information is good, but I still don't really know what to do with my boat. The author is very knowledgeable, but tries to cover too many topics/surfaces. I was looking for information on painting my fiberglass boat. He barely covered fiberglass, and now I will purchase Fiberglass Renovation, which I believe will provide the information I need. I think this is a good book, but I was dissappointed, because I still do not feel confident about starting such a project. This book needs more photographs, and step by step instructions for the DYI (Do it yourself) people."
1,Not Ready For Prime Time,"I had trouble setting up the drivers. The device paired with my device, but refused to work. I emailed the manufacturer in Korea and never recieved a reply with suggestions. I called it a loss and tossed it in a drawer until I could take apart their drivers or make my own up and get it working (given my work schedule, that might be never).I understand that some people got it working with only moderate difficulty, or none at all. I am not one of those.Jim"
2,Now this just doesn't work,Nope. This is is all glitter and very little substance. Dean Koontz tries a high-flying act here that simply falls on its face. This is all artifice and very little substance. Not at all satisfying to this reader.
2,Not so good (spoilers),"Yeah, it is bad; and dated. As most have explained, the beginning is much better than the ending. The Russian angle is interesting only in that I can't believe we (Americans) we're really that paranoid, but I'll give him that one. What I really didn't like at all was all the over-explaining. It was really annoying being talked down to like that. Its like being told a story about a story when all you wanted was just the story. Ah well it is an early work, only a consummate Koontz fan should suffer it, though. Thank goodness his writing has matured. The good new is there is a new Odd Thomas book out!!"
1,Disappointing,"I hardly ever give such a low rating, but I expected far more from Koontz. He spent way too long repeating over and over that the character was probably nuts. I was completely apathetic before the pace picked up. By then I couldn't have cared less what finally happened to her... he may have slipped political intrigue in, but by then it was just another crazy hallucination for me."
4,OOHHH!! IM SCARED OF THAT!!,This is one of the scariest novels he has written!! I loved this book it gets you all comfortable and then Bang!! your scared and you are wondering if there is an answer to this !! It is so be prepared because you will not put it down until you find out!!
5,The Best Book on Theatre I've Ever Read,"Moving, funny, inspirational. It is also the most informative book of theatre and what it takes to make it in theatre that I have ever read. It remarkably takes you not only into the creative mind and one man's passion for success. More importantly it takes you through the entire process of how luck and planning took him to a very specific goal. I can't recommend it enough for anybody who has ever dreamed of anything and wondered hot to achieve it. Should be required reading for everybody."
1,Review of the book Act One,Not suitable . Slow and unwieldy. woulod nbot recommend it for any one'Very difficult to read and stay focused on the subject.
1,The WORST Dylan book ever! BY FAR,"I've read at leat 15 Dylan biographies (out of print and in print). and this one stands out by far as a huge joke, stay clear of this garbage!"
1,My re-evaluation after listening to it multiple times,"I take many long drives and I have had the opportunity to listen to this CD beginning to end multiple times and I am disappointed about it. The only good song on the CD is American Badass. If you are a fan of Kid Rock for his Rap type songs(like I am) than you are in for a big upset. This album is mostly rock and poor at that. He doesn't have the strong beats and powerful lyrics that we have come to expect. Don't waste your money. Be happy with his other CD, Devil without a Cause."
2,kid schlock,"I gave this two stars because Kid Rock has the guts to put this thing out. All you ""artists"" out there take a listen and learn what not to do. Those who ignore history are destined to repeat it. If you survive, treat your eardrums with respect and feed them some Rage, Cypress Hill and Public Enemy. You deserve it."
2,BOOOOORING!,"The only good song on this album is ""American Badass"". Don't listen to the ""good"" reviews about this cd because those morons don't know what they are talking about. The rest of the songs on ""The History Of Rock"" are recycled trash from the early '90s. This isn't NEARLY as good as ""Devil Without A Cause"". Barely escapes 1 star rating because I really like Kid Rock. Don't even bother with this. Trust me."
1,bad cd in my opinion,"The first song on this cd, ""american bad ass"", stole the music from metallica's song ""sad but true""! Not only did the rest of the cd blow, but that was hella cheap! Now, that's just my opinion. If you REALLY like rock, get some metallica, godsmack, staind, saliva, or stuff like offspring if you like lighter stuff. Kid Rock is a poser."
1,Kid Flop,"Ignore the hype, avoid the marketing, keep your money! I was constantly looking for a fast forward button, some bits and pieces were ok (like the ones used on tv promo spots) but not any one song. I've always been a heavy metal fan and was thinking this could be some kind of a junction into a new genre of music. All's it is is a new piece of junk. The only way Kid Rap has got more licks than Randy Rhoads, is from people busting his chops for saying he's a rocker. So Kid just pull out your sampler and play by yourself like the rappers you inspire to be."
1,Sets Hunger Afire!,"Product tastes good but within 20 minutes of consuming it I was extremely hungry. Sounds good, tastes good but still has a lot of carbohydrates, sugary carbos that fuel the appetite. The Optima line of Slim-Fast does NOT control appetite for up to 4 hours as the label claims. This product would work if someone has a iron will and impeccable self-control but then any person with these attributes most likely does not need to use the product."
2,Bouncing Effect,"Nice product, and it works... but as soon as you stop using it.. you'll get a bouncing effect.. you will get back your loosen pounds back faster than you think. It works as long as you never stop using it."
2,It was ok.,This book was very short. It was ok. I really like Ed and Loraine Warren. This was not one of their best books. Not sure it was worth what I paid.
1,DOWNTOWN GIRL PERFUME,"15 Years ago, this use to be my favorite perfume. Then it disappeared from sight and I did not remember it until recently when I was looking for some new perfume. Much to my delight I found it on Amazon and ordered a bottle. I was very disappointed when it came. Either my chemistry has changed or there is basically only alcohol in the bottle. Maybe not original stuff? Whatever the case, it smelled bad on me. I much prefer Celine Dion."
1,bloody awful indie drivel DESERVES NO STARS,"Its amazing how the same yoofs ended up recording a couple of quite excellent albums several years later but in their obviously extremely sharp learning curve they very sadly dredged out this witless vile intensely pathetic drivel. Its everything sensible mature folks hate and loathe about cliched dreadful indie stuff. NO proper songs, just poorly structured noise that grates almost as badly as any punk rock, thrash metal or hippety hop garbage. This is a complete and utter waste of money!!"
5,The first step of a successful journey,"this album is very different from the most recent ones. it's the most indie of them all, doesnt have all the production from the others, but has great songs in it. it's kindof like an underground record from a garage band which just makes it sound even more awesome."
3,Where has all the other Howard on video gone?,"This was OK I guess. Not my favorite but I understand at the time it was a love letter to his wife. OK fine, I've been listening to Howard since he was on WNBC in the afternoon in the early 80s so it is hard to see a watered down sensitive Howard acting on screen. All in all I can't bash this though. What I want to know is where is Crucified By The FCC, US Open Sores, and Butt Bongo Fiesta? They should release those on DVD. They were hilarious. I'll tell you, for all the flack Howard is getting now he used to be much dirtier (and funnier, I think). Anyone remember his old channel 9 show? I wish I had taped those, if I only had known. Wherever those are they need to release those, please."
1,"Great movie, coaster of a DVD","Paramount is famous for this. Overpriced DVD's. They like to charge you over twenty dollars for a bare-bones DVD. No extras, nothing. Almost all of their DVD's are like this. I have been thinking about buying Wayne's World on DVD, but when I saw it's whopping price and no extras, I decided to stick with my VHS copy. You'd be highly advised to do the same with this movie."
5,Great Quality Movie!,"Movie was great, quality was great(did not need to get HD).Everything was great, no to mention this was a lifesaver since Netflix did not have this movie available(surprise surprise)."
3,5 STAR MOVIE! 3 STAR DVD!!!!!!!!,"The film is funny, smart and a keeper. But, the way Howard Stern sings the praises of DVD, I was expecting something special from him. No deleted scenes or narrative. Not even biographies. He is the KING OF ALL MEDIA!!!!!(excluding DVD)"
4,Good fiction,"Ha It's funny to see Stern say how much his wife and being married means to him, and now he'd divorced !It's even funnier to see how Imus treated him, then he goes and crys for his infinity boss' to make Opie and Anthony to stop talking about him, and get a gag order but on O&A.;The Movie itself is entertaining. But this is also the start of his fall from the top, as it's heard on his show...""It's over, johnny!"""
3,A little too self-congratulatory,"Howard Stern delivers a pretty standard, formulaic account of his rise to the top of the radio industry. His struggles with radio management are generally well-done, but the parts about his private life are not as interesting. To its credit, the film does not shy away from some of the difficulties in the Stern marraige. Nevertheless, the generally glowing tone comes off as a bit odd in the wake of their divorce. After all, Alison's primary complaint seems to have been the way that Howard aired the intimate details of their private life on his radio show. Now they are depicted on film for all to see."
5,Inexpensive alternative battery!,This battery is comparable to Nikon at about 1/3 the price. Charges and holds charge as well as nikon battery.
1,Useless junk,"Yup. I agree with the other reviewer that says that after one use it will not be recognized by a proper, working charger. I got exactly one charge-up and use out of it before it stopped working in the charger. DO NOT BUY!"
3,Complete is not as complete,"This Cliffs Complete product is not nearly as comprehensive a review and summary as the original Cliffs Notes book. While it does include the complete text, the summary and review is lacking."
2,Department of Redundancy Department,"I have liked some of Julia Cameron's earlier work, as well as one of her more recent (Walking in this World), so I looked through this one at a bookstore, but didn't buy. If she is so creative, why is she writing the same book over and over, year after year (or sometimes twice a year)? She needs to take her own advice: take some time for the well to fill up again. Hers has obviously run dry. It's getting to be rather sad, and embarrassing."
1,How to be completely self-absorbed,"This book is like every book by Julia Cameron. In it, she once again ponders her life as a writer. She once again pats herself on the back for all of her wondrous accomplishments. She once again looks in the mirror and assures us that she is still a beautiful woman. She yet again comes across as terribly lonely and makes writing look like a pathetic way to spend one's life."
1,"I don't know about the card, but the seller left me stranded","This card had some sort of defect where it stops saving pictures, or any file, really, at around the 500 MB mark, but does not display any error messages. Instead, it corrupts and destroys every picture. I tried the card on other cameras, with the same result, and also other cards in my camera, with excellent performance. I tried to get in touch with the seller many times in order to resolve the issue, perhaps return it and get a new one or whatever, to no avail. They simply ignored all my requests. Young Zebra should be ashamed, as well as Amazon for recommending them. Stay away."
2,Meat and potatoes revenge western,"Revenge western starring Raquel Welch as the title character, victim of a vicious assault by outlaws led by Ernest Borgnine. All credibilty goes out the window five minutes into the movie when it becomes clear the bad guys are comic relief villains. The ""rape"" sequence, meant to set up the story plays like a rejected scene from an old sitcom, thus the viewer is not given the opportunity to have any emotional involement with Hannie.For those of you who are still interested, Robert Culp mentors Welch so she can get revenge; and Christopher Lee shows up in yet another movie which wastes his talents. Pretty routine stuff, but at least its better than Welch's MYRA BRECKINRIDGE. (Is it possible for movies to get any WORSE than that?) Welch should have just shot the varmits at the start and mosied off into the sunset. Doesn't evoke fond memories of THE WILD BUNCH or Leone's DOLLARS trilogy."
1,Negative,"I tried the catnip tea after many recomendations. However, I discovered that this product is no different than any herbal tea, and demonstrated no positive quality of sleep-inducing. I will never buy this product again."
3,Art of Star Wars,This book is beautiful. I saw a copy of this in the library and I had to own it. I enjoy reading oversized books that are soft covered (some people might prefer hard covers). I would recomend this book for anyone who likes fantasy art and Star Wars.
3,Nice Try,"Jim Ellison and his two bandmates try to make an album that consists of nothing but catchy pop singles. Unfortunately, they only half-succeed. Yes, there are some good songs here that ring with the distinctive sound of classic 3-minute pop tunes. But the sameness of the songs drags down the album. Too much of this stuff just sounds the same. There are some rather mediocre cuts, also, like ""Trouble."" The title song is also rather weak. Finally, Jim Ellison's voice is wavery, off key half of the time, and lacks dynamics. By dynamics I mean that he sings a mellow song like ""This Letter"" with the same exact vocal delivery as he gives a rocker like ""Trouble."" Stretched out over an entire album, it gets annoying. I have a feeling that these guys would be a lot less legendary if they had stuck around. (Ellison committed suicide.) This is one of those cases of eventually rising to legendary cult status by virtue of putting out a couple of semi-good, undernoticed albums and then disappearing."
5,perfect album,"This album is perfect. It's everything I look for in punk. Angry, raw, pure, fast, fun. This album is truly perfect. Displays pure energy and good riffs, solos too. I'm glad I found Nausea."
1,Misleading,"Different from what is pictured. The name ""Enhancer bra"" and the picture led me to believe the bra contained the actual enhancers. Very disappointed."
1,No scent,"Got this candle after what seemed quite a long time for shipping, it has NO SCENT at all. There are 4 females in my house, not one of them can smell anything from this candle. I can't smell this thing either, I emailed Tocca, no response. Don't waste your money on anything they sell."
4,Chair,"This item was for me,but, I wasn't satisfied with the way it sat so, mygranddaughter wanted it and is very satisfied with it."
5,Warning: Anyone who takes this book too seriously will miss out on the fun!,"I picked up this book while taking a break from another and immediately realized what the other was lacking: sparkle. The indescribable sparkly zing that makes a book special.After just a few pages I found that besides style, the book also had a thrilling and clever Nancy Drew meets James Bond vibe that I can't get enough of; as soon as I finished I started it over again! It was even better the second time.Olivia Joules is my new hero, hope she won't mind if I borrow her Rules for Living."
2,Annoying voices,"Funny at times, but references to real-life terrorists is disconcerting and in bad taste. The voices are fine for the women characters, but HORRIBLE when the reader is doing men's voices. Especially annoying when it's American men. Skip the audio version."
2,Where is the spunk ?!?!,"Compared to Bridget Jones, Olivia Joules fails to entertain and bewitch the reader on so many levels. Might not be a fair comparison, but still.... The story is highly unbelievable, to the point of SciFi movies, and that is what passes for entertainment. I believe Ms. Fielding can do much, much better. I definitely wouldn't recommend this book"
3,Fast paced but misses something,"I adored the Bridget Jones diaries, which I think are among the cleverest of the genre, so it was with great anticipation that I picked up Helen Fielding's latest effort. I was disappointed.Sure the book delivers all that it promises - fast paced action in the beautiful parts of the world, potentially evil terrorists (or playboys?), big terrorist attacks, sub plots and red herrings. But somewhere along the way, I really began to find the book was quite hard going. I think I just stopped being interested in, or caring about our hero Olivia.It is certainly mildly entertaining, and as a smallish book it is a quick read, great for lying on a beach somewhere. But I think it is also a great opportunity missed. Perhaps it will translate better into a movie - this is a screenplay waiting in the wings."
3,Simple but fun . . . .,"I LOVED the Bridget Jones books . . . this book by Fielding, however, isn't the same. However, it is good as a quirky little ""fluff"" book . . . maybe some light beach reading. A cute little story if you want to ""zone out"" for a few hours. Warning, though: It DOES contain a RIDICULUS (sp?) plotline and some very one-dimentional characters . . ."
1,From Chic-Lit to Chic-Pits,I adored Brigit Jones Diary and was prepared to fall in love again....until I read Olivia Joules. The book had a horrible plot that could have only been created by too many late night of watching CNN by Ms.Fielding. While in concept the plot may have been a winner it quickly falls apart with far too many refrences to the Bin Laden family. I read to get away from the real world!!
4,Fielding delivers despite other reviews,I just finished Olivia Joules and must say I thoroughly enjoyed it. This book does not warrant the bad reviews it has received. I had stumbled across the book accidentally after finishing Dan Brown's Deception Point and aside from my familiarity of Fielding's other heroine Bridget Jones I knew nothing of the novel. If you're looking for an intense convoluted plot with intricate twists and turns this might not be the book for you. However if you don't mind a bit of silliness and a girl using a hair pin as a dangerous weapon I'd give this book a go. I found myself laughing out loud many times and about half way through and I soon decided I couldn't put it down. I spent the last two hours curled up on the couch reading the rest of it and was thoroughly satisfied. This book will transfer well to the big screen.
4,Fun day at the beach read,I am a huge Bridget Jones fan and was initially afraid Olivia Joules would just be another Bridget. But it was quite the opposite. I found the character to be fun and self sufficient in a different way than Bridget. This book is totally different than the BJ books and I liked that. Clearly Fielding was not trying to write the same book over and over. This book is fun and fast moving. I would recommend it for anyone looking for a light read.
1,Below Your Intelligence,"Journalist Olivia Joules (formerly Rachel Pixley) believes that Osama Bin Laden is masquerading as a millionaire French playboy. Oh yes, this book is tacky, Hollywood-style drivel that is neither thrilling nor funny. (...). I don't approve of that racial stereotyping. This book is surely below your intelligence - after all, it's below mine. (D)"
5,another great cd,"really like anything John does want to get more, but have to get better storage space for them,it arrived in good shape and quickly,and price was great also."
2,Are you kidding me?,"Robert Altman really ticks me off. He makes so many great movies that are either truly innovative or impressive for what you think he was trying to do, and lately it seems like he's taking on assignments just to pay his rent. This movie is so strictly formulaic, that's the only explanation I can think of as to why he did it.The acting is mostly good, with Patricia Neal and Charles S. Dutton giving their usual fine performances. Most of the others were okay, but the parts played by Chris O'Donnell, Liv Tyler, and Julianne Moore could have been played by just about anybody with probably little difference. What bothered me the most had to have been Glenn Close. Either the experience of playing Norma Desmond on Broadway and Cruella DeVille has gone to her head or there was a reason she was cast in those roles. I'm hoping it's the former and she's not just being typecast, but you have to wonder.Generally a very disappointing movie."
2,This Cookie Crumbles,"This is defintiely not one of Altman's best. I don't think it would even make it to his so-so list either. Gone is the bite of The Player or Mash. Gone are believable emotions like in Short Cuts or Nashville. Someone allowed Glenn Close to go far too close over the top and I was very disappointment with Julianne Moore's performance. Chales Dutton was very likeable (but, then he always is). I think the only thing I did get a kick out of was seeing Patricia Neal on the screen. This is not a good film. And I am a proud Altman fan."
5,Funny and good>>>>QQQQQQQQQ,"The Q's are a sign of good luck! Any way. I loved this movie. Any one who doesn't like this movie has bad taste. It is about a town of people in the south, a peaceful town. Until the old woman Cookie dies. She commited suicide, but her neice tries to cover it up in order to save her family the disgrace of a suicide. The neice and her sister make it look like a break in robbery and murder. Then, Cookie's best friend, Willis, is taken to jail as a suspect. The sheriff is convinced Wilis didn't kill her, because he fishes with him. This is a good comedy about people in a small town. Very funny. A good movie."
1,Non Working Product,The DVD does not work. It would cost me more to send it back then I paid for it so I'm stuck with a useless dvd.
3,Still a choice book.,Would have enjoyed the illustrations more iif so much emphasis had not been placed on equal representation of all children. Seemed forced - families are seldom in that mode.
3,Madonna Does R& B,"After the tornado of her SEX era, Madonna toned it down a bit in 1994 with the release of Bedtime Stories. Many critics and fans hailed this album as Madonna finally growing up or exploring a more grown up sound.Off into slowed down R&B; songs, the majority of the album is decent. This album is not one of my favorites, but worth having in my collection.The highlights are: Secret, Don't Stop, Human Nature, Forbidden Love, Bedtime Story, and Take a Bow. These songs really help to carry and make this album what it is. Madonna definitely struck gold in working with producers Nellee Hooper, Babyface, Dallas Austin and Dave ""Jam"" Hall.Though not an overall hit album, there are some gems on this one."
4,Bedtime Stories CD,This cd is one of my favorite Madonna CD's. It is sexy and straight to the point. It was shipped to me quickly and in good condition.
4,MADONNA SHOWS SHE HAS RANGE ON CD.,"Madonna shows range on this CD from the beautiful ballad ""Take A Bow"", to the R & B danceable ""Secret"" to the ever creepy crawly ""Bedtime Story"", Madonnas first single not to hit the Top 40 Billboard Chart. The CD lacks however on other songs such as ""Human Nature"" and ""Don't Stop"" which sounds like a retread of a song she sang in the early 80s. Overall a good CD, one song to listen for is ""Survival"" why this was not released as a single I will never know."
2,when is a live show not a live show?,"When is a live show not a live show? When the editor is an ADHD sufferer who forgets to take his ritalin. After 15 minutes of watching this dvd I gave up the forlorn hope of seeing at least 3 consecutive seconds of guitar playing, singing or drumming. After 20 minutes I was in danger of having a seizure. After 25 minutes I turned off the TV, put on the cd, closed my eyes and imagined I was watching them. Hard to give a proper score because there are two products. So I'd give the cd 3 and the dvd 0."
3,Too much crowd noise,"This album could be great if only the crowd had shut up while Evanescence was Rockin', Instead you get more crowd noise than anything. I believe that the editors of this CD could have improved this problem, Now I will have to figure out if I can screen out some of the roar. I don't know that I can do it, but I'll try in order to hear the live versions of these songs."
2,Fake concert!,"First, I am an Evanescence fan. That's why it's painful to have to admit that this DVD/CD ""live"" set is horribly disappointing. The only part of the concert that is live is the voice of Amy Lee. Everything else is pre-recorded. No wonder some of the reviewers here state that the band sounds great. Of course they do. All they had to do was show up and pretend to play. That's why you don't see any clear shots of the musicians in the concert footage. A sour guitar note or a stray drum beat is ever heard. It's all hocus-pocus. What a shame that the fans don't get to see and hear a real live performance in this DVD. Save your money and just by a traditional Evanescence studio CD."
2,Just did not work for me,I have a number of Evanescence CDs...I gave this one to my brother! Alot of the songs sounded like the same song....I like her 1st album and Open Door....
4,if u like live,"I am not a fan of live cd's, i must say. But the fact that this came with a dvd also was awesome! I love the music, but loved the dvd even more!"
3,Live Album!,"Excellent music/vocals! My only complaint is IT IS A LIVE ALBUM! I don't like listening to the audience screaming and yelling at the beginning of each song much less in the middle of the song over the music. In the middle of ""Breath No More"" Amy gets the audience to sing for her. I prefer the studio version (Fallen is the same CD except for a couple of songs)."
1,Major letdown...,"I love this band. They are the only band I saw this year in concert. However, I've downloaded a few non-official pro-shot shows that put this cluster-[...] of a production to absolute shame. What a piece of [...]. Let's see how many cuts we can make in the least amount of time possible. I saw more of the band standing on the floor 100 feet from the damn stage using my buddy's binoculars than this absolute sham of a live video. Note to the band : The behind the scenes footage and bloopers were great and you're fun to watch..but fire the idiots who filmed/edited and/or produced this piece of [...]. Amy, you're listed as executive producer, so if that means you were involved in this...then as an executive producer, you're a great singer."
3,DVD OK but CD not,"The package includes a DVD and a CD.The DVD that is included is great as you can see the tremendous effort the band puts forth, and the 5.1 Dolby Digital made up for a lot of recording deficiencies.The special features were wonderful and include a couple of very nice videos.The CD's recording however was just awful, it sounds like it was recorded from the fourth row with a Mr. microphone"
1,"Bad, very bad.","I can hardly call this a live dvd. It's more like a live performance with a lot of editing, when I say a lot, I mean it. When playing live, they keep the camera on a band member for less then a second before switching cameras! All these special effects going on really hurt your eyes. I mean, why would like to see a piece of footage in color for a second and then turned into black and white? Sadly, Amy Lee's voice live also is weak. (For all you Nightwish fans out there, you can see the comparison of Amy's voice to Tarja's...)The only good part I found on this dvd was the extra footage. A true Evanescence fan would love this part.The menu quality is pretty good as well. Something you don't normally expect coming out of a live dvd. They've even added a little easter egg into it.Not unless you are a hardcore Evanescence fan that you should buy this dvd...it will give you a headache, litterally."
2,Extremely dissapointing...,"I bought the CD because I had so much been waiting for a follow-up from Evanescence. Unfortunately, this live CD really does not deliver. The audio is just horrific and for the first half, the songs really douns like someone put a tape player on stage and had some dudes in the background play to it. Luckily, the second half is somewhat better.If you're interested in the DVD that comes with it, though, this is much more interesting. Buy it for the DVD if you like, but almost all live versions will make you stop and reach for the originals on ""Fallen""."
5,30 years was worth the wait!,Waiting 30 years to hear another Lydia Pense recording was too long. Why the wait? Lydia has not lost a thing since those rich early days. One of the best blue eyed soul singers of her generation should not be such a well kept secret. Its a true testament to her talent that such a collection of well respected musicians are featured on this CD. I can only hope distribution and air time can follow so more people can finally discover the talent that many inside the music business have known all along.
2,Cosmetically Flawed............,"Received and installed in March, 2010. Works fine in every respect. Tactilely it's smooth and comfortable.Has a soft satin finish, not high gloss. I like the closed grain of maple compared to oak finishes. That's thetwo star portion of this item........ These are veneer finished seats at this price point. Solid wood would cost moreor are stained some un-natural color..The one that was sent to me must have been made by an utter rookie in someoverseas plant. The veneers on the top lid have discoloration flaws in the wood and contact cement (or glue) stainsat almost every veneer seam. In particular every corner transition on both the seat and lid is stained and just plain pathetic.Highly disappointing! My hope for you, is that only I received the ugly one........."
3,"Pretty, But Wire Pops Out","Its a beautiful bra, but it's not good for exercising in and the wire then to come out a little."
3,positively Phranc,"Off beat, folksy, original type music. Its a nice listen, but I dont listen with any frequency."
2,not worth the hype,"i thought it would be more real. however, when he tells people he is making a documentary, clearly some people just do him the favor imho to be on the movie. i think thats how he landed a bunch of the rooms that he did. i could be wrong. but i doubt see lots of plugs throughout the movie. i was disappointed."
1,not the only Il Corsaro,"I'm surprised that Mr Cragg is not familiar with the Philips set under Gardelli. This is a beautiful recording with Jose Carreras, Jessye Norman and Monserrat Caballe, all in glorious voice."
1,not as advertised,"Mayfair makes very nice toilet seats, but this one was improperly described. I assumed that ""natural wood"" meant that the product was made of cherry. In fact, it was pine or fir painted to look like cherry. It was not even stained, just painted and the paint was scratched in some places exposing the white wood underneath. The oak seats are good, but I do not reccomend buying the faux cherry. I hope Amazon reads these reviews so that they can edit the advertising. I was very disappointed."
2,inferior product,"I made wrong assumptions about this description. Cherry does not in anyway mean cherry wood, it is painted a cherry color, no wood grain to it whatsoever. The product is slightly smaller in all demensions that the original Eljer seat it was meant to replace. It may be ""natural wood"" but you certainly cannot tell it by looking. It is a small painted toilet seat."
1,not sized properly,Not big enough for a standard oval toilet!. The seat does not cover the whole opening. The color is perfect though.
3,this book was kind of confusing but very into korean culture,i only got up to page 27 but i didnt think it was too good yeat. it was kind of confusing me because the characters were thinking to thenmselves but you couldnt tell if they were thinking or speeking because the author didnt specify un his writting.
3,Nice Zane Grey story.,If you are a western fan this is a nice read with many twists and turns. Enjoyed the story line and the ending.
5,Great Read,"Desert Gold is a great read and quickly gets you involved with the story. Zane Grey is simply a treasure and prolific author. This book contains a little big of romance, adventure and takes us back to a time before television and telephones."
2,Nice Idea but has never caught one mouse,"Even tried peanut butter on the ramp leading into the trap, they got the bait but never fell into the trap. Hawaii is a very rich mouse location and this has been outside around the garden, exterior of the house for months without catching anything."
1,Does not work!,"I have had this product set up for over 2 weeks now with absolutely no success. I have tried many different baits (chocolate, peanut butter etc). I followed all of the setup instructions to the letter, and the mice just walk right by it! Not worth the money!"
1,Mice can't figure out how to get in,"The first night I set up the trap, I heard a racket coming from my cabinet. I opened the cupboard, thinking I had caught a mouse...but instead I found the mouse OUTSIDE the trap, trying to GNAW ITS WAY IN to get the treat!!!I have had this trap set up for months now. It has never caught anything. Yet my Mice Cube (ordered on Amazon) continues to catch mice. The only reason I ordered this product was because I was having so much success with the Mice Cube (which only holds 1 mouse at a time), I thought I could catch multiple mice at once with this. NOT IF THEY CAN'T FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET IN!"
3,Necessary for little rodent problems,"Our cat caught the mouse before the trap did. However, our neighbor has these traps and has been successful so if/when we have the next rodent problem, we will give the trap another try."
1,book in poor condition,"there's a reason I picked this product. It wasn't the cheapest on the list but the description was good. I received the book and it has an extra bulk to it because of excessive use of stickies. The worst part of it all is that it cannot be removed and it's making the book lopsided. If I'd known this, I would have just bought the cheapest out of the list."
3,SOme good information,I found some good information. I was glad I found this book on Amazon it was awhole lot cheaper that the first site that was advertizing it. It pays to research even the books you buy to do researching.
5,A Wonderful Fantasy Adventure,"In The Elven Bane, Shana (Lashana) is born to a human of an elf lord in a time when people are considered slaves and elves rule all. Shana's mother dies out on the desert and a wandering dragon who is about to have a baby finds her and helps her give birth in the guise of a nurse woman near a place of refuge. Alara (the dragon who helps to birth Shana) takes the newborn human child and raises her with her own son Keman. Shana is Keman's ""pet"" but instead of being treated as an animal a marvelous relation forms between them.A great book for me and others I would highly recomend The Elven Bane to all readers whither they like fantasy or not (its a great opening book to those who don't know what to read next)."
4,Fantasy.... or Reality????,"Imagine you had no knowledge of your parents. Maybe you didn't even know your race still existed (or ever did). Put yourself in Shana's shoes (or lack of them).You are the unwitting and unwilling child of prophecy. Your mother, you never knew. Your father is still hunting you for the crime of your birth.Raised by dragons, the only ""family"" you've ever known, you are cast out because you do not conform. You do not belong and can never be ""Kin.""Follow Shana as she learns about life, love, treachery, friendship and, above all, herself.The Elvenbane is a classic fantasy tale, with a twist. None of the races (elves, humans, dragons) are how you have ever seen them presented before.Prepare to be shocked as only Norton and Lackey can. NOTHING is as it seems, but EVERYTHING is as it SHOULD be when prophecy steps in the way of tradition.If you miss this one, you're missing out!"
3,"Can get ""the"" conversation started","I bought this video for my two teenage grandkids. Before showing it to them, I watched it. This video was made in 1995. Overall, I think it provides good information and is quite representative of the time when it was produced.There may already be an updated version. If not, I think an updated version must include more information about the challenges and temptations today's teens face such as the Internet, social networks and pressure from their peers.Of course, a video can't take the place nor teach the lessons that should be taught by parents long before the teen years. I think the video can be a valuable resource to use to start ""the"" conversation between parents and teens. However, parents should be ready to add much more to the dialogue."
3,Fun but not tuff enough.,I bought this giga ball for my 8yr. old for his birthday. He loved it but it did not last long. After a couple of days we noticed small holes in it from rolling it in our back field. If you ask me they should have made it out of a more sturdier material.
1,Giga Ball Disappointed,The Giga Ball is a great concept and would have been a lot of fun but it wouldn't hold air. We are returning it.
2,Disappointing,"I was so excited to see this book that I grabbed it off the shelf and bought it without even opening it, but that was a big mistake. Unfortunately much of the book is repeated recommendations for the same restaurants in different locations. For instance, 9 pages are devoted to each Armand's Pizza and Burrito's Brothers...with the exact same review. While the reviews are helpful (despite a tendency to go for cheese-heavy or mock-meat dishes) the breadth of recommendations is poor."
2,short life,"We have owned this slicer for for about 4 years, and had the wire suddenly break for us this week. Fortunately no one was hurt. We had liked the weight and adjustability of this slicer. Unfortunately, it seems cheaper to buy a different, more durable slicer than to find replacement wire for this one and to risk injury from future wire breaks."
4,Well I liked it....,"Well, I liked it. I never encountered any of the technical gitches that other people are reporting, and I had no problem with the flick targeting. I enjoyed the combat system - its tough to do something some complicated seamlessly, especially without a keyboard or other device with lots of buttons.Hey, the story was a bit melodramatic and the voice acting was sort of funny, but I liked the cheese. The music was fantastic and I thought the game played very well overall."
5,Remake,"Wonderful game with intriguing story despite it's many technical problems. I think we should start a petition to remake the game for xbox 360/PS3 fix the technical problems, update the graphics,and leave the beautiful story and original gameplay as it was."
4,Great solution.,"I really liked this speaker stand. It's very simple and is nice and sleek. My only complaint is that I can't snake the 16 ga speaker wire with the holes they provided. I think it would help if they provided a slot, covered by rubber or plastic. That would make installing any wire a breeze. Imagine never having to snake speaker wire through speaker stands ever again. Radical!!! Other then that, I love the product. I recommend it."
4,Europe is alive again,"Yes I like the project and give it 4 stars. The album is dominated by guitar and vocals. I thought Joey (why doesn't he finally use his real name?) could have given more on this project. He sounds repressed and latent which fits the mood for many of the songs, but for crying out loud let it rip once in a while. The vocals take on a feeling of the Chile peppers dude ... californication and angles at times. Good album though. I have all the Europe albums and appreciate this one. It just wasn't what I expected, or hoped for."
4,One of the top 5 Albums of the 21 century so far,"Hero is awesome, stands out right away. This is not an album that jumps out at you right away, but after 4-5 times in the cd player, you're hooked. I was for sure. The album is better than 99% of all the other albums that are coming out these days- and that's b/c these guys have talent! Don't expect total 80s style, but do expect a great album. You can tell it's Europe, and I have to say it's nice that they didn't try to rehash their old songs or try to make their new songs sound totally like their old stuff.This album rocks, everybody that's heard it (even those who wrote reviews on here) said you have to listen to it a few times before you really get it. It was good the first time I heard it, but now I think it's a great album!It's not as cheesy and fluffy as most of their old stuff, which I love, but it's good stuff. Even those that hate Europe still can't deny they are great musicians!I can only recommend buying this album."
5,"Dip in, the dip deepens","Author claims to base his rearrangement of sections of the Tao Te Ching on earlier texts than usually used. His translation and rearrangement have taken me places I did not quite reach before and I am grateful for hisefforts. Lovers of the Tao will find his approach well worth adding to their resources.Michael EigenFlames from the Unconscious: Trauma, Madness and Faith"
3,They do scream!!,"i picked this cd up accidently but to my surprise this one rocks hard & good.The song ""better"" was a huge hit.This album is a cross between 80's hair metal & 90's darker groovy sound.c'mon is a good,fast opening rocker,""needle"" has good riffs.i also like ""stop the world""& ""sister tease"".""F.R.C""is a very naughty song,u will be amused on knowing the full form of the song.honestly ,i didn't became a fan of the band but it's a decent outings by one of the lesser but talented bands."
1,Induction?,I'm SO TIRED of products that don't say if it work with induction! Why not just say so? So? Does this work with induction? I'm having a hell of a time finding sauce pans with a glass lid (who would make a lid you can't see thru?)that work with induction!
2,saw it for 27 dollars less,very dissappointed good deal for the price. I don't know what else to write about this. It's okay is all I have to say.
1,Not for ceramic cooktops,"This seemed like a very nice fry pan, but when I actually got it the bottom was not quite flat. I have a ceramic cooktop so that is important. I returned this immediately."
1,"Fallacious, inaccurate, and illogical","Again, we are subjected to another ""Afrocentric"" book that fabricates nonsense after nonsense.The author does not allow fact and truth to get in his way, as he concocts yet another "" everybody in the Bible was black"" fairy tale.Please do your research, and learn a very simple truth : The JEWS in the Bible were JEWISH!!!! Not a difficult concept to grasp, huh?At this rate, I suppose Julius Ceasar, Ben Franklin, and George Bush will one day ""become"" Africans !!! Hey, if they do it to Jesus and the disciples, why not?Thanks for reading."
4,Great book. Should be on kindle.,"Great commonsense information put together with a light, friendly tone.Chapters and steps are broken down into smaller, easy to do steps.No weeding through pages of fluff, or filler recipe pages, either."
5,This is what I was looking for....,"This is what I was looking for. Not another diet book, I have them all, and ALL have fallen short. This one is different. Diet books are like pain killers: They don't help you solve the problem, they just help you to mask them.....for a while!! This book goes to the root of the problem whether it hurts you or not, and makes you look at it, see what is causing it, and find ways to FIX IT, for good!"
1,BE (Both Elephant) sucks,"Don't ever buy a gun made by BE ever, every gun I've used made by this idiotic company ends up not working properly due to what I believe is poorly constructed internal parts. My friend bought this gun a while ago, and after charging the battery it fired maybe 3 shots before it stopped shooting entirely. We couldn't figure out what was wrong with it, nothing appeared to be broken or jammed, it just wouldn't shoot. Also two other guns I've bought made by BE stopped working after like 5 games. And what kind of a name is ""Both Elephant"" anyways? The only thing good about BE is the hilarious writings on the box."
2,"Worthy book, but is analysis biased?","This is a worthwhile book to read as an introduction to a number of fascinating personality disorders. The primary flaw: the authors assume that popular stereotypes equal scientific fact, and tailor their analysis to support the stereotypes. For example, the passage explaining that men 'act like men' because they have shadow ADHD accepts several negative stereotypes as premise. Certain comments, asides, and occasional cheap shots detract from the objectivity of this study, and hint that some of the conclusions are agenda-driven."
1,Based on the Idea We're All Crazy,"A nonsensical book based on the notion that your brain makes you crazy, and there's not a darned thing you can do about it. What really surprised me was that the syndromes described are so elusive and based on almost no research. There's a lot that's ""shadowy"" about this book--mostly the obscure writing and even more obscure premise. Skip it."
4,"Great book, needs a bibliography","This is an absolutely fascinating book. The idea that there are ""mild"" forms of mental illness, which we may all have pieces of, is extraordinarily useful in understanding myself and others.The book absolutely cries out for a bibliography. I would guess that the authors prepared one, and that the publishers omitted it. It is an absolute necessity which I trust the publishers will remedy immediately."
5,Perfect single serving egg pan,This is a fantastic pan. I purchased it to fry eggs. Perfect non stick; eggs slide out. Easy cleanup. As good as more expensive calphalon for my use.
2,not a good pan,"I have three other pans from Calphalon which I really enjoy using. This new pan does not come up to the standard I am used to. It is not truly nonstick. Sorry,I have lost faith."
5,The Rosetta Stone of Funk,"Welcome to Ground Zero, funkateers. Without JB, would we have Sly? P-Funk? Prince? Would Miles have gone electric? Would hip-hop exist? The answers lie within these 4 discs. This set is DENSE, but oh so fine...I've had ""Star Time"" since its release in '91 (it's the reason I bought my first CD player), and it is still in heavy rotation. Worth every penny then, and now."
3,Beware! Not as funky as you think it will be..,"I am troubled by StarTime as it contains at least one whole disk of the early, non-funky, material. For a better collection of James Brown at his funkiest try Make it Funky(1971-75). This cd shows how good JB was even after Bootsy left. I also recommend Funk Power 1970, which highlights the Bootsy Collins era. However, if you like the complete James Brown career with ballads like ""Try Me"" and ""Bewildered"" you may like this collection. If you just like the funk, buy the two cds I mentioned above and save about 20 bucks."
3,Typos and Distraction,"The Freeman's text, while investigating a new branch of nursing practice (i.e. CBT) and discussing the application of this type of psychotherapy to one's own advanced nursing practice, is marred by something as simple as typos. How any editor could allow a book out of the office with so many spelling errors and so much problematic punctuation is a mystery to me. If you can read around the errors and pretend that educated people don't normally proofread their work, then this book shouldn't bother you too much.The meat of the text is interesting and the application of CBT to a wide range of disorders is explored. I appreciated the coverage of traumatic brain injury, as this is a common finding in my own practice."
3,Good CD - not great,"Dickinson is by far the better singer and exemplifies what NWBHM is all about. Anyone who likes ""the other guy"" better might as well listen to new Metallica albums.Although I do agree that ""Run to the Hills"" is the most overrated song in the history of metal, I disagree with the gentleman (underneath my review) on some other critiques. First of, ""The Evil That Men Do,"" is one of if not the best songs on this comp. It may not be classic, prototypical Maiden, but it is epic, which is what NWBHM is all about.Anyway, get the CD - it's worth it"
3,Does what it say's...,...but Senna is dangerous and can cause liver and electrolyte problems if taken longer than 2 weeks at a time. The latest research has linked it to colon cancer. I wouldn't use it regularly.
3,Hummnn,Not something you want to drink the evening before you have to go somewhere the next day. A little harsh I think. Just make sure you will be close to a restroom the next day.
5,It works for me !,"I have been using Smooth Move for about 7 or 8 years. I was having problems with constipation and found nothing would work for an extended length of time. A friend suggested Smooth Move, I tried it and the rest is history. I have a cup of Smooth Move every evening between 8 and 9 pm. In the morning it serves it's purpose and has been year after year. I love it and I still enjoy the taste. Consider me a lifer."
3,"Box labeled ""Our Gift to You""","I cannot attest to the cooking qualities of the pot, as I have to return it, but it is even nicer looking than the picture above. Planning to give it as a gift, I was dismayed to receive the pot in a damaged carton, and even more disappointed in the yellow area printed on the upper right corner of the box, where in two inch letters it states ""Our Gift to You"". The pot was obviously the ""freebie"" in a promotional offer. Buyer beware, you cannot use it as a gift. It looks like you are ""re-gifting"" a free offer when you actually paid a pretty penny for it."
5,This is a good book..,"My father died almost a year ago and I bought this book in October 2004. I'm still having a hard time reading it; not because it's not easy reading, but because of the depth of emotion it conjures up as it pushes me to reflect on the relationship between me and my dad. No matter how old I get, I will always miss him and wish I could have stayed young and he could've lived forever. I think when I get to the end of this book, I will have gone through more healing through my grief. It's that kind of book.."
5,Very Beneficial to Understanding the Influence of Fathers,"As an adult I recently lost my Dad and unexpectedly had immense grief and confusion. This book was so helpful to me understanding what I was feeling and offered great hope of the things to come. Clea Simon explains her own personal findings as well as experiences from other women who have lost their dads, with particular focus on us as adults. She covers a broad range of women and their lives affected by their fathers, and then beyond when we face life without them. I was happy to know that his impact on me would grow, even after he was gone."
2,received a different product,"I ordered this item, however the merchant told me it cannot be shipped to my country.They offered me to select a different product.They didn't have the second one I picked,, but from a third try wefinally found a product they can ship.It arrived quicky and everything is ok.Two cons:- it would be better if condoms are packed in some bag and not just put in an envelope- product they send me is cheaper than the one I initially ordered and I was charged for thepricier one. I asked if I'll get few condoms extra cause I pay them more, but I got no reply"
2,A CHORE to get through,"Reading this book was hard work,and pretty irritating to get through. It is written by an Englishman and is strictly for English audiences. Practically every page contains slang, colloquialisms and references to people, places, and things that have no meaning to Americans at all. The writing style is also confusing, going back and forth with the subject at hand so you constantly have to go back to figure out who said what about who when etc. NOT a pleasant read. I am a great Peter Green fan so I muddled through. The author is obviously not a musician either, not very insightful commentary on music or musicians. Lots of anecdotal hero worship, which according to Peter's history and interviews is exactly what he does not want. Hard to believe this is the authorised biography."
5,This is a great CD,"This is one of the best CDs by unsane. If you like hardcore, you should get this CD as soon as you can."
4,we love the baby avalon products,4 stars and not 5 only because of price. we love this stuff. it smells good and the bottle lasts a long time. if only it were a little cheaper!
3,"N.W.A part interesting, but who cares about the rest of his career?","I liked this book but about three pages into the tangent about the non-N.W.A part of his career, I became very bored. After skipping this section, the author returned to his description of his experience with N.W.A and it got interesting again. Decent book, but who cares about the non-N.W.A part of Jerry Heller's career?"
3,emotionally draining,"I loved the first movie ""Why did I get Married"" and thought I would enjoy this one as well. Whereas the first film dealt with serious marital issues there was also quite a bit of comedy laced in, which I liked. The second one didn't have any comedy (or not much) and everything was so gut-wrenching and sad I almost couldn't take it. All of their problems were huge and just seemed so depressing-- it did make me cry a lot.It's very well acted but I guess I was looking for a little less serious themes, as in the first one."
2,Not as good as the first,"I really loved the 1st movie ""why did I get married anyway""? This one was not up to par for me. I usually like all Tyler Perry's movies, but didn't particularly care for this one. I didn't even like the ending."
3,It's a sequel,It fulfills the contract for a sequel and maybe a third spin off will come from it. The movie was a B-
2,disapointing,"I usually enjoy Tyler Perry movies. This one was just over the top melodrama with no laughs. The characters jumping to (wrong) conclusions and the vindictive, uncontrolled reactions wore thin. Stick with the first movie."
1,Not Calphalon I'm used too,"This is the worse nonstick pan I have ever owned!! I was expecting A non coated (Teflon) Pan as my others were. I'm very sad that I ever made this purchase. I loved my other fry pan,I could Bake,Bar-b-Q,anything I wanted. It was a 16', and I found that alittle to big,But it was the best, wish I still had it. Never buy from an unknown source!!!!!!"
3,Too weak,The product is great and useful but it does lack a good weight support. I have my belts hanging on it and it is starting to lean. It could be the way I screwed it to my wall but I doubt it is.
5,nice read,"I really enjoyed reading this at the end of the day. The stories were short, uplifting and motivational. I've read another Chocolate series too and enjoyed that."
5,Like a box of truffles,Just wonderful! I connected with so many of the stories. I enjoyed it immensely.
2,So so movie with crappy art whore ending,"**REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILER***I like a good slasher movie, the more gore the better. I like suspense and drama too. This movie tried to combine them all - and actually did a fairly decent job. It could of been a solid 3 star beauty in the rough. HOWEVER, I'm getting a little miffed at movies that have an anti-hero ending simply to make it more artsy or make the director feel like there's some kind of deep meaning. Some life changing moment in film.That's fine and dandy if your owning a 5 star file (for instance Cold Mountain - kills the hero and still ends up being a fine movie). Or your solid Trauma type movies like ""Hobo with a shotgun"" - ending MAKES that movie a solid 3 star gore fest.If your a decent little 3 star movie and your going for that 4th star by killing your hero, just don't do it. It pisses me off. Anyway that's my rant. Thanks for reading."
1,A talented filmmaker produces garbage,"Well I was fooled into buying this piece of anti-Chritian garbage;I may try and get a refund...it's muddled point of view was pointless but its agenda was clear -- to smear all religion as evil and irrational,one and the same - paralleling witchcraft and Christianity during the Dark Ages...Obviously the director has used his talent, and I will admit he is a talented storyteller, for either misguided purposes or to deliberately distort and smear Judeao-Christian religion by generalizing ""all"" religion and religious belief by utilizing the period of the Dark Ages as the defining characteristic of ""all"" religios belief; superstitious, ignorance and violence actally came as a result of corrupt intitutions concealing the Bible from the masses and distorting its teachings to accomplish worldly goals of power and wealth.The actors are very talented as is the director -- but in my opinion the content was garbage - biased subjective garbagedont waste your money"
5,Suprisingly Good!,"This is obviously a low budget movie however it is very well done. The acting is top notch. As a Christian, I did not take it as a swipe at Christianity. It was simply a character study of a young man. Extremists exist in all dimensions and all religions. Who hasn't wondered about what created someone who seems to be a monster? Any belief, forged in tragedy and despair, can molt into disastrous outcomes. I am actually curious as to why there was not more publicity for this particular film. I believe it was supposed to be released to theatres in 2010. I am not going to jump on any conspiracy theory that it was held back because of controversial religious themes. Adult audiences (who should be the ones watching this because it is rated R) should be able to untangle the various themes without taking it personally."
2,Not What I Was Expecting,"I was expecting the movie to live up to the name and be about the plague, but the black death only provided a backdrop to the action. The story is about religion, power, culture, and paranoid ""justice"" in the middle ages. But that's not exactly right either because the writer didn't do a great job of researching. Things like knowing that only a priest can give last rites (not a novice) make a big difference in believability of the plot. Lots of good actors were cast, but it was sadly a waste of talent. Add to that the shaky-cam and weird cuts and you have a disjointed film. If you are going into this with the intention of suspending reality and going along with a dark, head-slashing, blood gushing medieval fantasy ride, you will enjoy it. It just wasn't for me."
5,"Dark, gory and fascinating","This was a very dark movie about a very dark time. The love thread was truly that, just a thread. Lots of gore. The story line is good though. I really liked the movie. Questioning the good of religion and witchcraft is interesting."
3,"Sean Bean shines in ""Black Death""","in this historically rooted horror-thriller, Bean stars as Ulric, a church-appointed knight in the age of the Bubonic Plague's first wave in the 1300's.He is tasked with investigating rumors of a woman who can bring the dead back to life. A young monk is aiding Ulric on his quest to root out the necromancer-- and to determine whether or not she has ties to Satan."
3,Interesting stories.,Lots of interesting stories of the working of the porn business but it does drag on in certain points. Lots of jumping from story to story. Hoping there would be more juicy celebrity tidbits but more of her life story instead.
3,"entertaining, well written (thanks to Neil Strauss)","I was not expecting much from this book, but somehow found myself getting to the end of it in no time. The story is interesting, there is surprisingly little sex (though ex post is seems logical given that for Jenna, sex is mostly work), the tone in which it is told is very honest with no lies and no trying to look better than reality, all in all this is good entertainment.Tough to decide whether Jenna is actually smarter than many would have thought (could be the case), or whether it is just that her stories were put together by a smart writer.Not, of course, one of those wonderful biographies of a wonderfully impressive person, one of those books that one must have read (such as Ralph Freedman's biography of Nobel Prize holder Hermann Hesse, ""Pilgrim of Crisis""). But good, wholesome entertainment."
5,Cant put it down!,this book is wonderfully and graphically written.. they should make a movie out of this book.. the ups and downs of thee most famouse porn star of the 20th century!
5,What a life,"I loved this book so much it was amazing to hear about all of the things Jenna had to put up with to get to where she is today (which is of course the ultimate Porn Star). Her advice for the Men and Woman was also good, especialy the part where she tells Men what NOT to do!!"
4,"INTERESTING, INFORMAGTIVE, AND SAD","A great book to treat what ails America.We don't really know how to make love.I note that others are trying to do something about this in such recent books as Sex Ring in a Small Town, which is not porn as it may seem, but a happy, instructive book without a downer in it.This author ought to give John Pelham who wrote that book a jingle and both of them should go on Howard Stern's show together."
3,Modern Romance Novel,"I found this book interesting and insightful on some subjects I knew very little of. I read a lot of romance novels and this book reminded me of one, such as overcoming diversities, falling in love with the ""wrong person"" and finding your true love... and just like a romance novel mostly fiction.There are a lot of inconsistencies in the book. For example Jenna claims she lost her virginity at the age of 19 and there was blood streaking down below her knees but in her diary entry she's only 15. The chronological order of the book gets confusing usually when its dealing with her teen years. I don't the book is a MUST read but if you ever have time to kill, then it would be a good read."
4,A triumphant tale,Jenna Jameson is a beautiful girl who had an extremely hard life. This book was difficult to put down and I found it quite entertaining. It is amazing she has overcame such adversity to make it as a star. Good for you Jenna!
1,self-serving porn bores all who read this stupid book,"Junior high students write more interesting stories about native aborigine cultures on small islands than this person does. Self-serving, puerile, boring and less exciting than daily soap operas. She looks good, but she is truly dumb and boring when writing. Keep doing the pictures and SHUT UP)."
3,"Not impressed, or disappointed","I didnt know what to expect from Jenna Jameson, so I cant say I was disappointed. The beginning sucked me in and my page 400 I was bored. I finished the book because I got so far and enjoyed it, but was the most disappointed with the end. Definitely not a must read, but not the worst."
5,Couldn't put it down,This book was a fantastic read - even if you're not familiar with Jenna Jameson.I had never heard of her yet couldn't put the book down.
3,Meh,"The first half of this book is really interesting and hard to put down (written in first person by Jenna). However, after that the format of writing changes and it's more of a dialogue/interview format which for me got really boring- interviewing her with her family and people who knew her throughout her life. For me this book was just okay... I have yet to finish it."
1,Misleading title; Not worth the money.,"The book did not even hold my interest as a porn story. I expected some novel and amusing ""pointers"" in the sex game, but she had nothing to offer; not even any interesting encounters. Who wants to hear about her childhood, what Daddy thought,etc.This attempt at writing makes apparent the intellectual level of a person who chooses this type of life."
4,Did Demi Do It w/ Redford or Not?!?,"Demi Moore and Woody Harrelson play a couple in a sudden bind financially. When trying to strike it rich in Las Vegas fails, enter Redford character to the rescue. When Redford proposes them the answer to their problems the end result could spell disastorous. Though the movie never actually shows Moore and Redford sealing the deal, it kinda makes you wonder if it really did happen. One really powerful scene in Indecent Proposal is when Harrelson is having second thoughts and wanting to canel the deal tries looking for Moore realizing that they are already leaving via helecopter on the roof of the building he is frantically trying look for her."
5,Excellent Movie !!!,"Tremendous movie. Great acting, fascinating story, stimulating and provocative. As current and thought provoking today as when it came out."
5,Good Price Fast Prime Shipping,"Product was in stock, at a very competitive price, plus the Prime shipping made this a very good Amazon deal. The Kohler system is very high quality and coordinated with other Kohler products."
1,Non-Stick and Non-Robust,"I love Calphalon, but they should do better than this product. The non-stick coating lasted less than 5 months even following the manufacturers instructions (1) wood and nylon utensils, (2) hand wash, and (3) NEVER MORE THAN MEDIUM HEAT."
5,buy play enjoy,"Billy Scott & the Prophets Ready to Party is just that, a nice package that goes from pure boogie to the still of the nite with the Title cut and the ever great cover of Rainy Night In Georgia and covers like Rocking good way, Billy swells to his best on One in a Million, great cd with a variety of flavors for your music taste, great guitar licks by Randy Floyd and beautiful female vocals from wife Cindy Floyd, buy play and enjoy."
1,"Pretty, but not very functional","I like the Calphalon Contemporary line a great deal, and so I was pleased to find the steamer insert that fit my pan. But my first attempt to use it was a failure--the small steamer holes (and not very many of them) are easily covered by the food to be steamed, leaving the insert to function like a double boiler. After working for close to an hour to steam summer squash (which should take 20 minutes at most), I gave up and dumped the squash into the steaming water and boiled it. I'm sure that some foods will steam in this pan, but items that lay flat like sliced vegetables will be a problem."
2,Scanner lamp failed,"This is a follow-up to my earlier review. Since then my scanner lamp failed. Warranty repair was quick and successful, but like the other reviewer they forgot to lock down the scanner head! These lamps must be defective BIG TIME."
3,Microtek Support Update,"I would like to add to my review above of this product after having a horrifying experience with Microtek support. My scanner lamp went bad a few months after I purchased the scanner. I returned the scanner to Microtek and they sent it back after about a week, ""repaired"". Turns out, they did not set the locking mechanism on the scanner and it came back with teeth missing on the gears that moved the scan assembly. They replaced that one with another broken one that would not detect via USB. They replaced that with a third one that worked, but did not include the light lid (even though they told me they were sending me a brand new scanner). Their support was difficult to deal with. I like the scanner and the software, but it loses two stars for their support being MISERABLE!"
1,"Not a ""work horse""","I purchased this scanner in Feburary of this year. I was pleased that the installation was easy and for what I used it for the quality of the scans were Ok. Unfortunately, the scanner totally quit functioning after 12 scans! So the referral on this product being a ""work horse"" wasn't true im my particular case. In contacting the manufacturer, I learned that the effort of getting this scanner fixed wasn't worth the scanner. I would not recommend this scanner or manufacturer to anyone."
1,So very disappointed!,"I purchased my Microtek product less than a year ago. Actually, it was 7 months ago. The product stopped scanning some 2 months ago. Because Microtek does not provide the consumer with a warranty, for obvious reasons, I was stuck with it. I do not recommend that any one purchases a Microtek product. I will only buy Canon or HP. I'm forced now to go out and buy another scanner soon. Its very frustrating. I, like the others, experienced that the lamp stayed on. And for me, the scanning ""rod"" inside would not move and scan the objects. Now please note that I have used this scanner all of 10-15 times since I've purchased it, so its not like I've used it daily. Again, stick with the big guys (Canon and HP). With them you get better customer service, warranties, and quality products. And you wont end up being the guinea pig since they are still trying to get this thing right."
5,The Art of Psychic Protection,The Art of Psychic ProtectionI loved it. This is the second book I have purchased. I purchased the 2nd one for my daughter.
2,Not that good of living...,"I didn't like this book. As the proud owner of a Cape Cod style house, I bought this book with the idea that it would help in resoration and remodeling. Instead, it made me wish I hadn't spent the money. Although there are some nice pictures, the author's treatment of the subject is too serious and in some cases without taste. I was especially disappointed in the glowing praise for an old farmhouse that had serveral huge ugly tenticals built out of it. This guys has no sense of style or beauty. Pass on this book and buy Cape Cod Architecture by Clair Baisly. Ms. Baisley has a wonderful and warm writing style that makes you wish you could invite her over for tea. She explains the various aspects of the architecture, how to date features, what belongs, what probably doesn't, and above all to just enjoy this wonderful thing you call your home. The dry Mr. Wills is the sort of guy you just want to get rid of, and I have."
4,Very pinkish..a bit country in one spot...nice new stuff,Stylish new material from a fabulous musician. Contains a real cool drum sound too. Sounds like a really old snair drum. Cool country flair on one track. Some pinkish sounds throughout. Sit back and enjoy - from a room with a view...
1,Worst movies ever,"These are by far the longest, most boring, and overall possibly the worst movies ever.The Godfather part I comprises maybe 3 or 4 of the most boring movies ever. It's about 10 or 15 hours of stupid, inane BS that nobody could possibly care about. I tried to watch it all the way through, but fell asleep after about 6 hours.The Godfather part II is even longer, somewhere between 15 and 20 hours, which according to Godfather fans makes it better than the first.The Godfather part III is so boring and awful that even fans of the first two movies can't stand it.And keep in mind, I was able to sit through all 4 or 5 hours of Citizen Kane and I actually kind of liked it, so my taste in movies is not the problem here."
2,Restoration Sucks,"I watched the first of the Blu-Ray Godfather Trilogy, ""Godfather."" The video noise on this first disc is annoying.Very Disappointed in the Godfather Blu-Ray. Not the best"
1,Terrible quality - Coppola should be ashamed of himself.,"Suffice it to say that the quality of I and II are TERRIBLE. They are grainy, have blips, and the lighting is overly dark. Others reviewers here have said the same, so this is not just my overimagination. I love the films as much as anyone, but cannot DE-recommend this collection enough.Coppola obviously put absolutely NO effort into cleaning up the old prints. Seeing that he has not done anything really worthy since 1979 (Apocolypse Now), I take this release as a way for Coppola and Paramount to maximize their return at the expense of quality, and our pocketbooks.Please, don't make the mistake I did. Don't waste your money."
5,This is an offer you can't refuse!!,"One of my top 10 in blu!!!!, now give me TLOTR Trilogy, Braveheart, Gladiator, Pulp Fiction, Star Wars, HEAT, Jason Bourne Trilogy, The good, the bad and the ugly, and 7 Samurai and i will be complete."
2,IT'S NOT DIGITALY REMASTERED,"To Start the Movies are awesome for sure. But I had the Collection on tape already, and the quality is no diferent, they just threw the same picture on the DVDS with the one bonus disk with the extra footage, which is the only reason I gave it a 2. So basically I paid 80 dollars for the extra bonus footage. Almost all the other commentaries were on the tapes as well. The first DVD is all pixilated on an HD TV, and the sound quality is terrible as well. Pretty much the same for them all though. I am very disappointed in Paramount for this rerelease to DVD. They need to take a look at how Lucas remastered the StarWars, Which in My opinion is no where near as good as a movie as the Godfathers. Maybe in another 10 years, or when they want to make more money off of the trilogy, they will digitally remaster, and sell a special edition godfather trilogy set and make another 80 dollars off of everyone. Sad part is, I will buy it too."
3,Package is disappointing,"The quality of the BDs is good and exactly what I expected.What is a big disapointment though is the package quality. After opening, the paper box dismantled itself. The glue that sticks the parts of the box together was there, but it didn't mean much.Part of the package is a booklet. But it is slightly bigger, so you cannot put it back inside.In overall - Such a quality product deserves better packaging. They killed it for me with that."
5,SHOULD BE SIX STARS,"Coppola's masterworks take on a living-tapestry quality when viewed in the mesmerizing, seamless collection provided here. Gorgeously shot, and full of remarkable acting, music, costuming, sets, these films define America's development throughout the first half of the 20th century by concentrating on the details in one crime family's growth. Wow. Though Part III suffers from the miscasting of Sofia Coppola, who gives it her best shot, it still holds up, filled with those grand, swirling sequences that combine violence and art so imaginatively. I think the second part, with DeNiro and Pacino starring, is the most richly observed, and covers the broadest canvas the most effortlessly. However, seen as a gigantic whole, you will be overwhelmed by the stories told, and by how well they are told. It is a work of lasting power and true vision. Enjoy it over and over again..."
5,Americana at its best,"This collection is a powerhouse both of cinema magic at its best and a marvelous tale of why the whole world is enthralled with and desires the ""American Dream"". We never tire of watching. Thank you Martin Scorcese and the entire cast! Bravissimo!"
5,Husband likes,"I bought this collection for my husband. He really likes the quality. Yes, it is a little grainy, but that helps set the mood for the films. I noticed some people stated the bonus disc would not play. Our bonus disc does play in our Blu-ray player. The Blu-ray player is a cheapy from Walmart. All in all, we love this collection."
4,OK,was looking for the directors cut version of these movies and this is not it - well done anyway and we enjoyed but not what I was actually looking for.
1,Very disappointed in the Godfather DVD Collection,"My video of the Godfather is a much better product than this dvd. I can barely make out the what the characters are saying, but first and foremost, I expected the non-cut version of the movie. I feel like I have been ripped off."
5,The Godfather,"These are the best mafia movies of all time. This box set contains an extra disk with deleated scenes, extended scenes and interviews. buy this box set!"
5,i am eagerly waiting...,"this is a masterpiece, as we all know. but i am just curious that why there is not any vcd or dvd version of this famous film available, and just only VHS tape. i don't like tapes. they are easily subject to wear and tear. and most movies today have their dvd verisons, including many rubbish movies. i don't know why. i really want to have a dvd version of this film. just waiting for its release......."
5,The best De Niro's role.,My favorite movie ever. Copolla made the almost impossible. A sequel even better than the original. De Niro is terrific!
1,Let dead men sleep.,"The Godfather movies are the greatest movies ever. Atleast 1 and 2 were. We don't need different versions. The originals are the ones we loved and the originals are the ones that were acclaimed. We don't need ""new versions"""
3,Godfather 2 is Split up Into Two Discs!,"The title says it all.I was quite disappointed when in the middle of the second film I had to take out the current disc and put in another. If I had known this, I would have never purchased this boxed set. Other than that, it was as good as the movies were."
1,Huge disappointment,"Already owned and viewed this collection on dvd and believed it would beconsiderably better on blu-ray....WRONG! In fact, playing blu-ray onone input and dvd on another, ceteris paribus, none of us could discernany difference between the two. The blu-ray and dvd images were identical.Why pay more money for blu-ray when the digital copy is identical to whatis put on dvd?"
4,GREAT,PURCAHSED FOR HUSBAND HE LOVES THE MOVIE THE QUALITY AND SOUND WAS AS TO BE EXPECTED. WOULD PURCHASE AGAIN. THOUGHT THE PRICES WERE GOOD ALSO
2,2 Stars for the horrible restoration quality,"I absolutely agree, word for word, with unluckyfrank's review.I too purchased the standard DVD set of 'The Coppola Restoration' and it is bad - not worth the money bad. I found myself CONSTANTLY turning up the brightness, turning down the brightness, turning up the color, turning down the color. It is unbearable!Worst of all, I found myself yearning to watch the original release right in the middle of viewing my brand new 'Coppola Restoration'.I was expecting James Bond quality restos, this is not even in the ballpark. The James Bond restorations and the Alfred Hitchcock restorations are stunning in their quality, the Godftaher should 'whack' the studio boss for this one!"
4,The Godfather Trilogy,"The series is excellent, in fact almost an American classic. The series carries the Corleone family through three generations as they move to America. They first settle in New York where Vito becomes the head of a large crime family. They eventually move their base of operations to Nevada as they get into the casino business. Michael, Vito's son is trying to make the family legitimate but has considerable difficulty with the conversion."
5,The Masterpice,"I have one word to describe this movie ""masterpiece"". If you are a mafia movie collector this is the movie"
5,A Great DVD Set!!!!!,This is a great buy! You get all of the Godfather Movies on DVD and additional behind the scenes footage and commentaries. If you are a Godfather fan then this collectors set is for you. I was not disappointed with this purchase. I am very pleased with this collectors item. It exceeded my expectations.
3,"not all that..........a star for 1,2,and the bonus disc","it's great to finally have this collection on dvd finally but....watching pt.3 is awaste of time and space and the quality of 1+2 is only fair.there are some parts of pt.1 where the the dubbing is obviously off.to put it nicely;the black levels of my t.v. was seriously challenged by the numerous dark scenes in this movie.i though either the dvd was defective or someone tampered with my video settings(niether of tha above).for 70 bucks this pkg. is dissappointing.....in a perfect world,these dvd's could have been pkged individually with all the extras on the first 2 movies so i wouldn't have to purchase the third. don't rush to get this one......or get used(depreciated.i'm ready to send this back to it's maker for a full refund..."
1,playable,THE DVD DON'T PLAY ON MY DVD PLAYER AND THAT IS BAD.PLAYS ONLY ON MY LAPTOP. IT IS NOT GENUINE. IT WILL BE MY FIRST AND LAST TIME I ORDER ANY DVD FROM THIS SITE FROM ANY COMPANY.
4,Dark spots!,"What is there to say about the Godfather Series. They are a part of the American Culture as Apple Pie. Although, one thing I am dissapointed in with the movie--certain scenes within the movies, in which the Don would speak in his darkened decision making office are extremely dark. One can barely make out the Don much less the setting. One would think with all the technology available today, those parts of the movie would be alot clearer. Maybe they will release a ""Newly improved Godfather Series ""."
1,Returned it,I returned the product. Did not view. Another family member had the product and had recently bought a similar product and so there was no necessity for me to keep it
5,THE THREE GREATEST MOVIES EVER MADE,"GODFATHER 1 IS THE BEST OF THEM ALL.MARLON BRANDO GIVES A SPECTACULAR PREFORMANCE.SO DOES JAMES CAAN ,AND AL PACINO WHO GIVES OSCAR WORTHY PREFORMANCES IN ALL 3 MOVIES.GODFATHER 2 IS EXELLENT . I LIKE STORYS OF OF THE YOUNG VITO CORLEONE.AND THE ASOME PREFORMANCE OF DIANE KEATON.THIS ONE DOES NOT HAVE AS NEAT A ENDING AS 1 AND 3.GODFATHER 3 SHOULD BE CONSIDERED ONE OF THE GREATS.IT HAS OSCAR WORTHY PREFORMANCES BY ANDY GARCIA AND JOE MONTANA,AND ALL ACEPPT THAT SOPIE COPPOLA.MY FAVORATE PART WAS THE THE ENDING PART ,THAT WAS THE GREATEST PART OF THE MOVIE.THESE MOVIES ARE THE BEST OF ALL TIME."
3,"We're not made of money, ya know","The Godfather movies are masterpieces...especially parts 1 and 2. However...what's with the price??? There is only ONE bonus disc (whoop de doo!) and lets just say the picture quality is not the best that it could be. Each movie sold seperately would be about twenty, so all three of these movies would add up to about sixty at the most. However, you can not buy each movie seperately, they make you buy all three at once! They're milking all of us for our money and most of us are falling for it.It's such a crime that they think they can get away with scamming us."
3,Damaged,This item came in really poor packaging. I thought the discs may have been damaged considering the box was completely demolished. The plastic wrap around it was extremely loose and looked like it had been through the worst!
2,Region Error,"The price for the Godfather Trilogy set was reasonable. The shipping information was adequate and arrived when stated. Unfortunately, when my husband & I tried playing the DVD's in our DVD player, we received the message ""region error"" on our screen. We tried playing the DVD's in other players in our home and received the same message. Not being able to play the movies has been a true disappointment."
1,Not Close to HD But a Good Story,I purchased the Blue Ray treatment of this classic as a requested gift. If you already own this on DVD save your money because the HD treatment is VERY poor. Comparing my 5+ years old DVD version which has been watched at least 5 times with the 'NEW' BlueRay treatment I have to say neither offers a better picture -- and the improved picture is what I thought I was chasing.Two stars because it is the Godfather. Rating the upgrade alone I would give it one star.
5,A deal I couldn't refuse,"Just when I thought it couldn't get any better, they pull me back in! Godfather fans should snap up this collection. It looks even better in Blu-ray."
3,Shape of movies,I thought that the movie collection would be in better shape. The box looked very old but the movies played well.
5,Not a Zip Wall,"This is not a Zip Wall System. If you want to erect a plastic dust containment system, buy the Zip Wall. It's far superior for that purpose. If you want a ""3rd"" had to hold sheetrock against a ceiling, or other heavy duty overhead, or even some horizontal tasks,this is the one to buy. You can exert considerable force with these and if you work alone, you'll find many uses for the 3rd hands. I agree the pins are a little hard to depress, and the bag is a little too small, minor issues. However this is a heavy duty system that compliments the Zip Wall. In my opinion, buy them both, you won't be dissapointed."
3,More Marty and Jordis,"I have given up looking for the entire season, but this is a decent substitution. The behind the scenes clips are funny, but I would have liked something with the complete season. Oh well..."
4,performances not from the TV broadcast,"Surprised to find the best performances from the TV show were not taken from the TV show, but a later concert. More polished, with the addition of chorus, brass, and strings - but not as fresh and perhaps lacking in the excitement and surprise on the performers faces when they realize they have hit it just right. Would love to see the broadcast versions for comparison. Still really like the behind the scenes stuff."
4,Rock Star INXS Gets My Vote,"I didnt actually watch the show.I caught a few episodes here and there.As well as some of the reruns on VH1.Well I was hooked on JD from the second I saw and heard him.So when I heard about the DVD,I figured it was a good way to catch up.I would have liked them including the actually finale announcing JD.And would have loved more JD perfomances.But all in all,I enjoy the DVD.Obviously I am a JD fan,lol..But I enjoyed a few other rockers as well.Jordis singing Imagine was really moving,Suzie singing Bohemian Rhapsody was so entertaining.Also liked her version of Losing My Religion.Marty doing Baby One More Time was interesting.Was kind of cool to see a different spin put on the pop song.Also really enjoyed Never Tear Us Apart.Was really nice to see JD interacting with all the other rockers on that..Of course I would prefer every episode on dvd,but this was still a great purchase.And you cant beat the price!"
1,Rock Star: INXS the DVD,This should be rated a 0 just like most of the professors at the colleges would grade!
3,even a toy breed needs to be watched with this,"we have a 20 week 2.4 lb male yorkie who absolutely LOVES this toy. the only problem is he was able to unravel the rope in less than a week. so how do i give this a fair review? well, he obviously loves the toy but sadly it is not very durable."
3,work!!!,"It really is a ""WORK"" book. It takes alot of thinking and quiet time to answer the questions and to go back and analyze what you have written down. Too much work for me. I guess this book would be good for someone who has alot of extra time on their hands to ponder their life. I do not have that time."
2,Deceiving Sale,"When I reviewed the ad it did not state that the book was written and highlighted in, the ad stated it was a new book. Very dissatisfied."
4,not as good as the hardy boy casefiles,"you can't beat the hardy boys casefiles. if your looking for fast past action the hardy boys casefiles are the books for you. they have machine guns, bombs and terrorist the hardy boys casefiles if your looking for these kinds of books are the books for you."
4,"Lyric, funny film","Mediterraneo is a wonderful meditation on war and life's priorities. Lyric, beautifully photographed and coarsely funny all at the same time. I look forward to it's release on DVD."
3,There's better out there,"I really liked the look and feel of this sweater. The sleeves are a bit puffy and the I didn't like the cuffs. I'm 6'0"" 170 and the medium fit perfectly. I ended up returning it and went with theCraghoppers Men's Corey IV Jacketin medium. More of an athletic trim but a bit less thick."
3,Good looking sweater,"I bought this sweater based on two factors: price and warmness(?). For the price this is a great looking sweater. However it does not fulfill the second goal. It is not warm at all. In the inside it just has some cheap materials that do not isolate the wind and lets everything pass trough.Pros: StylishGood priceNice material from the outsideCons: Not warm at all (main purpose)Cheap materials in the insideIts a decent sweater for the price, but the fact that it does not provide warm is a dealbreaker for me. Although I wont return it, I may never buy Columbia again."
4,$19.90 for a work jacket,I ordered these hoping they can be worn at work instead of dress sweaters that cost $9 to dry clean!
4,Nice Jacket,It fits true to size. It isn't too thick and not too light either. It was exactly what i wanted. It also fits loose just a little bit.
4,"is a good jacket, comfortable","Good jacket, is a big jacket to be size small but I like it, maintain the body warm so I recomended"
1,Quality not what it used to be,"Having had one of these fleece jackets that had served me well for many years, I bought a second one recently. After one hard use fishing in Montana, the zipper casting broke and made the jacket useless. Comparing the two I noticed that they have changed the zipper manufacturer. The new design is not suitable for its intended use. Don't buy until they strengthen the zipper design."
2,Did not care for this adaptation,"I must preface this review with an admission that Mansfield Park is the novel I like the least of all Austen's novels. Fanny Price is not my favorite heroine either. I found this adaptation even less attractive than some of the other versions. I did not care for the casting, and the flow of the scenes confused me. At times the sequence was languid, and other times it sped along. I did not think the story was true to the text either. All of the main scenes were intact, but details of the backstory seemed thin or missing. This one is not my favorite."
5,Beautiful!,Came in the mail very quickly and was perfect- no flaws or anything. It's goregous! I use it especially for my belly dancing class.
2,Sorta Kinda Almost OK,"This book was good, but really a waste of time with so many better works out there."
1,BORING,The book is totally boring I got thru the first 4 pages an stopped I have to do a book report for school so can someone do it for me??
1,Horribly Booooorrring!!!!!,"I'm in the 10th grade and I was assigned to read this book and it was horrible. I can't understand why the school systems and the states don't let us read more interesting books, books we can actually relate to. It was extremely hard to read and I don't recomend this book to anyone!"
1,This is literature?,"I usually don't post many negative reviews, but hey, if we only post happycheerful responses, where's the feedback? I quite thoroughly despised this book, as much as I've hated anything in a long time. The main character is a jerk set up to look like a developing hero, only the development is shallow and unlikable. The sudden enlightenment at the end is even worse -- my response was not only a general ""yeah, right,"" but a ""man, did The Youth die and was replaced by some alien presence?"" The only good aspect of this book was that I got to write a really scathing paper on it for English, which is always fun. Suffice it to say, I didn't like it. However, I wouldn't discourage anyone from reading it, because it's an acknowledged American classic, so SOMEONE out there must like it -- there must be some merit to it, it just didn't appeal to me."
1,Great... If you like the Patty Read's Doll,The Red Badge of Courage is the worst book I have ever read. The book does not have any cliff hangers. It is really boring the author makes the book so boring you could fall asleep if someone is reading it to you. The author could have made it way more exiting by making more people die. This book should tell you about more characters it only tells you about and describes at least six people. If you have already read it it has wasted allot of your time.
1,"Poorly written, to say the least.","""The Red Badge of Courage"" is a poor excuse for a classic. I took me over a month to finish this dreadful book, and I have nothing to show for it. I've gained nothing by reading it, except hatred towards Crane's writing style. With nearly no recognizable plot, you'll wonder if your just reading random words thrown on a page. Only read this if you must, because it is not at all pleasurable. I do not recommend."
5,This is a GREAT book for young and old alike,"The Red Badge of Courage, an action-adventure book by Stephen Crane, is a great for young and old alike. Henry Fleming is a young boy out to seek adventure in the Civil War. Henry wants to be a war hero like in Homer's epic poems. Soon he starts to find out that war isn't just fun and games. He follows other troops onto the battlefield. Then he gets into a big battle. He starts to realize that there is more to battles than shooting, there is the fear of death and that he needs bravery and courage. A great African once said ""Courage isn't the absence of fear but the triumph over it.""This book is good for all readers ages 8-150 years old. There is some mild violence but that is it. It will capture younger kids with the action-packed battles of Henry Fleming. It will capture the older peoples hearts with its thrilling story line on how he starts to become a man through hardships of leaving home and battles on the front line."
4,If you didn't read this in high school...,"If you didn't read this in high school, you should have. What motivates an inexperienced soldier faced with the horrors of battle? Images of heroics, shame, primal urge and all the rest pulse through a young man's brain as he struggles with the big question: fight or flee."
1,Boring,This book was slow and the ending was garbage. Henry is a coward no matter what he does in this book.
1,The Red Badge of Courage Takes a Black Side to Enthusiasm,This book really didn't interest me at all. I was not happy about how the book was written and it made me want to drop it and never pick it up. I couldn't get into the book at all. The story line was hard to follow and nothing seemed to make sense. As soon as I got into a certain section the plot and idea would change. I'm not a big reader and I really thought that this book would interest me in the slightest way but it really didn't! I was very upset and let down!
2,The Red Badge of Courage,"My name is C.G. and I am in the 8th grade. I just read Red Badge of Courage by Stephan Crane and I thought it was ok. The book took place during the Civil War and about a young solider, named Henry. Henry made excuses everytime he ran away or lie about something. In this book, I enjoyed the part where the loud solider, Wilson, changed his personality because the war had changed him and he is like a motherly figure now. If I could change anything in this story, it would be Henry because he questions his own character. I do not recommend this book for any girl. If you like a classic Civil War book, I think is a story for you."
3,So-So,It's kind of an old-fashioned book; a little confusing and hard to follow. I would recommend it because I think it is accurate and really tells about the Civil War.
4,red,The Red Badge of Courage is a quick read and beats the hell out of The Scarlett Letter . this one is a lot easier to get into
2,So bored...,"I felt like this book would never end. I had to force myself to read it. Some of the content is very good. But between the good bits is just repetitive fluff about troop movement. There are some great ""takeaways"" from the story and a few parts are fairly gripping, but overall, painful to read."
1,DANGER: EXTREMELY ALMOST DEADLY BORING BOOK,I had to read this damn book last year and again this year. It is the most boring book you will ever read. It kinda makes sense in someways if you have your English teacher explainging to you the foreshadowing of all the boringness going on. Horrible but if you want to read it don't say I didn't warn you.
3,Over Rated But This Is Where Hemingway Stole His Style,"I came away from this novel with disappointed expectations. While the novel pre-dates modernism, ""Courage"" clearly influenced Hemingway and all that followed him.Maybe because this novel was at the beginning of a wave of anti-war novels, it doesn't seem fresh anymore. Or maybe it really isn't that good and is gliding on a High School english reputation.I am reading his collection of short stories."
4,Great war story,This is a classic war story.A young man goes into the army to prove himself but finds out that war isn't as he imagined. He eventually finds the courage to fight for his country and proves himself. I really understand why this is a classic.
4,"This is a great pan and rack, but I hate the utensils","The pan is awesome. Maybe it could be a bit heavier, but for the price it can't be beat. The rack and pan have held up well over the years. The non-stick surface hasn't scratched at all, and the rack cleans up perfectly every time it's used. it fits large roasts 10LB+ and it fits tons of pasta for lasagna or baked ziti.The utensils are horrible though. The Baster/Injector leaks so I threw it out and got a new one from elsewhere. The lifters are so-so."
3,Scientific?,"I am surprised at the other reviews of this book. It starts with good insight into the feelings of someone with ADD, then it jumps to a pseudo-scientific explanation of the maternal figure not being involved with a child during a critical time of brain development. He belittles his patients who don't think this happened to them. If you don't buy his premise, you might as well not buy his book."
1,Freud? On ADHD? Are you serious???,"I was a bit shocked upon discovering that someone has actually tried fitting ADHD within the framework of traditional psychoanalysis (i.e. Freud). Suffice to say, it doesn't work. A neurobiological condition doesn't quite jibe with complexes, classical narcissism, and the like. But the author does invest a good deal of elbow grease to adapt some very awkward Freudian theory to contemporary brain science. It might help his case if he limited his explanations to purely cognitive/behavioral/scientific or Freudian/psychoanalytical/""It's All Mommy' Fault"". Trying to squeeze both into one book is a bit, eh, ridiculous."
4,before kingdom come!!...,"hey if you guys like kingdom come, check out lenny in the group Stone Fury. this was way before kingdom come but has all the things you like and the tunes are good for the era.....early to late 80's. if you find anything let me know cuz i'm searching for it myself. I used to own it on tape but made the mistake of selling it. c ya"
4,Good old space opera,"In true space opera style this wraps everything up just a little too neatly to be believable, but if it didnt, it wouldnt really be space opera now would it?The things that had been impossible and unthinkable for the first 5 volumes are accomplished in a whirl by a few extra talented kids zipping around the bad guys home planets and lancing them with mental bolts too strong to be resisted. Still worthwhile to me though."
5,"Funny, Wise and Heartstopping","I do not know what I expectd when I bought this book, but what I got was much more than I thought it would be. This is not an easy book for me to read, but it is illuminating. I have been divorced for three years and while reading this book, I realized that without intending to I have put my life on hold. I've been waiting for the right someone to come along so that I can start enjoying my life again. This is not a good way to live. This book has gently shocked me into facing the reality that right now I am single. I have felt sad and ashamed about my situation, but after reading the author's story, I felt proud of her and of all single men and women who refuse to settle for less and have figured out how to be satisifed, fulfilled,and independent. I want to be one of those too. The author's funny and wise words have inspired me. The tips at the end of the each section are genius."
3,Calphalon Pasta Strainer,"I ordered this thinking it will fit nicely inside a previously purchased Calphalon set of cookware. Had to return the item as of course, it was useless without appropriate fitted utensil. Searching for a POT to allow use was futile because:(a) expensive(b) meant buying a second item making the total purchase prohibitively expensive.(c) Amazon did NOT have the online capability of ordering the missing POT to house the Pasta Insert even though the combination pot and insert were advertised for a combined price no more than 10% of the original purchase price of the insert.Caveat Emptor. Hazards of on line shopping!"
1,"Horrible Stroller!!! Disservice to the ""Jeep"" Brand","This is a horrible product. The front wheels wobble uncontrollably, even on a flat, even surface. This made the stroller completely unusable. We double-checked our installation and oiled the wheels just to make sure it wasn't user-error. It wasn't. If Jeep vehicles are constructed as poorly as their strollers (and other accessory products), you can be sure that I will NEVER buy a Jeep!!!!"
1,Seisco Ra 22,"Great idea - poor qualityPurchased RA 22 in 2004. Finally put it in the trash today.It was out of service 9 times in 7 years.Tank cracks, TH sensor failures, Circuit board outages.I have the dates and detailed failure information,I give."
4,Great-- but a little disappointing,"I love Donovan-- going back to 1965, when my very first single that I bought was ""Catch the Wind."" I have also bought a number of his albums and ""Greatest Hits"" compilations. About two years ago, my friends and I went to Torrington's Warner Theatre to see him play live (on the same bill as Roger McGuinn of the Byrds!!!).Anyway,I received my copy of Donovan's DVD and ran to my DVD player to watch it. The concert was, on the whole, very good. BUT, I was a little disappointed in Donovan's VOICE. It may well be that he had some problems that one night in January, 2007. But, for the first time EVER, he had difficulty in reaching some of the higher notes. And, at times, he merely SPEAKS the words!!!!! Has anyone else noticed??? Also, I was hoping that he would perform ""Atlantis."" He did not.Still, the DVD is well worth the price. I was just surprised to see him struggling on the vocals."
3,"SPHE Edition (March 4, 2011)",This is my review of the SPHE edition.The video quality is great.The film is not so.There are no subtitles.I recommend this release for Abbot and Costello completists (even if it's a Costello solo).
5,magnicant,Paul is one the most moving pianist I have ever heard. Each note is played from his soul. I recently had the opportunity to hear him play in person and meet him afterward. His entire collection is outstanding.
3,Suggested improvement.,The product works but could be improved if they added a large pocket on the inside to hold the accesories.
2,Good Idea Poor Design,There should have been side pockets for the tops and bottoms that snap on to the posts. It is nice to have somthing to put the 3rd hands in but the bag is to big. A molded case would be ideal.
3,Tight squeeze,"They were too skimpy when they sized this bag. I was careful to fully retract both ends of the poles. The first pole just fit, but by the fourth pole I almost ripped the bag fitting it in. Nice idea, but an extra few inches would be much better."
3,Great pan but coating doesn't last,I loved cooking veggies in this pan. But am looking for a new saute pan as the coating on this one is gone after a year or so. I believe it should last much longer than that.So have to say I would not recommend this pan.
4,cool song mix,this cd has cool songs on it. but some songs arent all that popular. so if u want a cool mix to listen to get totally hits 2 now.
3,Hmm Mediocre,"I liked the cover for this CD. I liked most of the songs but some, like Lou Bega, are plain annoying after you hear them too many times. For people who really like the Various Artist CDs, try the Max CDs and Fantastic Females. I'm not sure if they are avaliable in the US because I got mine in Asia. I didn't like Totally Hits 2 as much as 3."
2,Non Stick scratched,"Enjoyed this sauce pan. The build quality is high, the glass lid is nice to be able to check boiling levels without opening the lid. I wish this was just hard anodized without the non stick interior. Very careful with my cookware, but the inside has been scratched."
4,Lid fit is not quite perfect,"I'm used to very good quality out of calphalon and am not completely disappointed with this product. However, I have noticed that the lid does not fit perfectly and has to be slightly pushed down to seal. Other than that, the pot is wonderful."
1,2 years later this pan is flaking,"Calphalon advertises this pan as being anodized that won't chip, crack, or scratch, and it is not suppose to flake like teflon.I am sorry to report after 2 years of using this pan I can confirm that is does badly flake. I recently noticed this after I was making a white sauce and was confused why so many ""black flakes"" where in there since I had not peppered my sauce. After inspecting the pan I could see small textured scratches along the bottom that showed the pan was flaking and it's anodized layer was wearing away.While this pan was an absolute dream to use before this it will not stand the test of time. I highly recommend Amazon users to not purchase Calphalon's anodized pans or sauce pans. I can't imagine consuming the flaking anodized layers are good for your health."
5,I love this Saucepan,"Although I am a prolific cook, I will never be mistaken for a ""chef"" and all that that implies. My usual cookware is utilitarian Wolfgang Puck and Ultrx. Nothing fancy. This saucepan is a step up for me and I bought it because of a recommendation in Cook's Illustrated magazine. I like its even heating properties, cool handle, tight-fitting lid and the fact that it is absolutely non-stick. Because it has no ""hot spots"", it is ideal for delicate sauces. And the price cannot be beaten. I may even buy more Calphalon. But not many more."
5,Perfect multiuse pot,I love to cook and find this pot is very well made and has an excellent durable finish.I purchased it at Amazon and find their service and selection makes them easy to shop with.
1,Warped and Warped again,"Out of the box the pan I had warped after the first use. If you have a glass top, or otherwise completely flat cooktop stay away from this pan.I contacted Calphalon and was sent a replacement which took approx 2 months. When I received the replacement I put approx. 2 cups of water in it and began to heat it on medium high heat and had the same result. It had a terribly warped bottom and is what I would consider to be unusableI do have other pieces of cookware from them that do not exhibit this behavior. I am again contacting Caphalon to replace the pan a second time however since I have had two pans now with the same problem I have little faith that a third replacement would be better."
3,Original was better,"Ordered this video thinking that it was the original.This re-made video was good, but Not with the emotional impact of the first one.Enjoyed the movie, but not as good as the first one."
2,This movie is too 'hollywood' for the tragedy that occured.,"Used to really like this movie for what it was: a Hollywood production to make money. How sad it is when tragedy strikes (no matter how many years) Hollywood is going to reap the rewards. If you want to see a somewhat more of a documentary type of a VERY low budget of the Mexican 1976 version SURVIVE! instead. Amazon has a decent copy really cheap and it's not the terrible dubbed American cut. This film is cheaply made but gets to the heart of the situation at hand. This movie to me is more disturbing than the Hollywood re-make. Don't know how many friends of mine tell me what a great film ALIVE is, but I have to disagree. It is like watching Hollywood making war movies that look 'too polished'. Check out SURVIVE!Survive (Supervivientes de los Andes)instead. It's not the great Hollywood show stopper, but it does get the message across!"
5,A man who gave so much and deserved so much more.,"The father of weather forecasts and explorer of South America. Robert FitzRoy will be remembered by me. This book tells us about a great British aristocrat who gave more than he took. I love Patrick O'Brian and this could have been his but it is real story about a real person. FitzRoy was a remarkable man who history has pushed back to the shadows and labeled Darwin's Captain. FitzRoy, whose family is descended from Charles II, becomes a beloved British Man-o-war Captain, explorer, politician and eventual Vice Admiral. Mr. Gribbin gives us a picture of one of the last explorers and scientific innovators who charts South America, tries to support native rights in New Zealand and gives the world weather forecasting, yet is forgotten. His end did not justify his life. He was an amazing man who deserved more. He was faithful to his family, his country and religion. A good man and a great read."
3,"Not great, but not terrible","Look, the game is not the best in the NES library, but it isn't Dragon's Lair or Dr. Jeky and Mr. Hyde.Yes, it's unlicensed with its baby blue cartridge. Color Dreams changed their name to Wisdom Tree so they could start making stuff like this. All three games have the same background music. It's atleast challenging enough to call it a game but it isn't a great game.Watch the AVGN video he does for this to see what it's like."
2,Pointless for the average cook,Maybe it is because I have a traditional American range but the heat really does not distribute on this wok and it is kind of pointless so I just use a regular fry pan. Really a waste of space in my kitchen. I am wonder if there is another use for it....
4,joyous and tasty,"I've come late to this music, being a haole from New England. Better late than never. This live cd has in-your-face great sound quality and every selection by Led, Ned and Dennis is joyous and as tasty as fresh pineapple. One star is lopped off for the short numbers and mere 34 minute program. This is still one of the most enjoyable Hawaiian cd's available. Great falsetto harmonies."
4,great tire,"I got the Country Rock tire from a local sports store, as some of the other reviewers, to replace my knobby tires on my MTB since I use it now for a 26 mile round trip commute. I was also looking at the Forte Gothams, but wanted a little more aggressive tread since the route I take is part paved, part unpaved (dirt/gravel). I took them out for a test drive the day when I got them and I was really impressed on the smoothness and how quite they were, but compared to my previous tires I'm not surprised. Since they don't offer much flat protection as commented on by other reviews here and on the net, I put in plastic tire liners and Slime to make sure I get to and from work with little or no problems. It's a cheap insurance policy for an affordable tire.Now that I've had it for a while, I'm really liking the this tire. My speed has increased about 2 mph and I'm getting home about 15 minutes faster."
2,Conures by Tony Silva,Quite a nice book to read but so far out of date to really be a waste of time for the breeder or anybody seriously considering breeding conures. The Author had not heard of DNA sexing which is now the considered norm. This fact immediately made the book obsolete as far as I was concerned.
2,one good previously unreleased cut,"You may prefer this version of music originally released 27 years ago and easily available all that time, but the objective fact is that the band found it unacceptable and said so unequivocally in the Crawdaddy interview quoted below. The liner notes to ""The Lost Trident Session"" blatently lie, and quite a few ""reviewers"" are merely rewriting those liner notes. I agree with the Mahavishnu Orchestra: most of this recording is just not up to scratch.Five stars for ""John's Song #2""; one star for the rest."
3,Not Among Their Best Efforts,"My first impression of this CD was that it predated Birds of Fire. It seems to lack the refinement and cohesion of that hallmark album. Although it is certainly worth a listen, I don't consider it among their best."
4,The 101 Commandments of Networking,"Sometimes we tend to forget that Common Sense is all what we need but we are all too preoccupied with other things that Common Sense sometimes seems way too difficult!""The 101 Commandments of Networking"": Common Sense but not Common Practice. Just want to share with you how much I enjoy this publication. This book offer profound statements that are pertinent to the work environment and for personal living. I believe this book have sparked a side of me that I didn't know I had and found something new to think about, a new way of doing something, a plan to change some invisible thing that needed improvement. It has given me introductions and conclusions to speeches.In this book all Commandments are clearly written and easy to understand. The humor is also refreshing. Worth reading."
3,the 101 commandments of networking,"Janice, Thanks for sharing your networking gift with the world. Networking will not be the same in the future because of you. God Bless you a million-fold! Alease"
1,Won't Stand Behind Product,"At first, we loved this ultra quiet vacuum cleaner. After one year, however, it started sounding like a jet engine. The turbo-nozzle had broken. I live in a major city and no one within the city limits services these things, and when I ordered a new turbo nozzle, they sent a mini. It turns out that the actual replacement nozzle, listed at $29.99 a year ago, now costs $125.00! The explanation I got was ""Prices are subject to change without notice."" Now I'm stuck with a 5-inch mini turbo nozzle and my wife is going to kill me. Plus the cord, which used to snap back into the cannister at the touch of a button, creeps in while we're vacuuming--and when we press the button too. I love it at first, but I'll never buy another Electrolux. It's not well made, and they don't stand behind their product."
5,"Very function, good suction and pretty quiet","Seems to be a solid well made vacuum. Suction is good, the carpet sweeper does a good job of rotating and brushing up the carpet and the head design on both allow for good access and pivoting. Saw some complaints that it was plastic, but that is an incongruous comment these days. I like the vacuum to be a light as possible. However, it still is fairly heavy, but not too much so."
4,Quiet & Powerful,This is a good machine at a good price. I found that the turbo brush is the easiest tool to use on carpeting.
3,Electrolux EL6985B Harmony Vacuum,"Great suction and the vacuum is light weight and easy to move around which I do like. Not crazy about the floor attachments. We have all hardwood floors and they don't feel smooth as I vacuum. The brush attachment on the handle falls out of it's snap-in holder all the time while vacuuming using other hand held attachments. The foot pedals for cord retraction or power are difficult to distinguish. When using the floor attachment, it isn't able to stand on it's own, which would be much more convenient than always having to lay it down, or find a wall to lean it against. The bags are easy to replace and have a great system that closes the opening as you pull them out so the dirt/dust is contained. I don't hate this vacuum, but I don't love it either because of the flaws."
3,Buyer Beware,This is NOT the Electrolux that you've know for quality. The owner of Eureka (some European company) bought the name Electrolux some years ago and the change is just taking effect. The Electrolux that you've known for quality is now Aerus. The name Electrolux may still be with Aerus name but it is required to be smaller than Aerus by agreement. The name was purchased to dupe American buyers...its just an Eurekavacuum.
5,Great vacuum!,"I am very happy with this vacuum. It is light and neat and very strong, easy to use. It is quiet, not as quiet as I thought it would be but half as quiet as my old one. It is much more pleasant to vacuum now."
1,Disappointment,"As with a lot of contemporary Christian music, too little respect is shown for God and love is too often defined as a commonplace thing. The album isn't praisey enough. It's too folksy. It sounds as though we were in one of the Trump Hotels. The orchestration is run of the mill.In addition the words are too unenunciated. They talk out of the side of their mouth. In the spirit of `Heart of Worship' this works well. But on most other tracks, the singer might as well be humming. Open your mouth dude. Either that or be consistent and tell us you're a wordless dervish.Track 7 has got to be a low point. And who's the guy in the background (e.g. track 2, 2:50)? Is it George Bush or an air traffic controller? I'd sooner hear cows praising God."
1,A waste of money!,"My cat doesn't like them at all. I have even tried to re-wet them and she refuses to eat them. I have placed them within her wet food, and she eats around them. It was a waste of money. I had to wait almost a month for them to be delivered, they should have kept them!"
2,Mere Background,"This is not a bad book. It is well structured. It is elegantly written.As background for a curious general reader, it is admirable. But it fails to paint the essential picture of Hughes.For this and other generations, a large, all-encompasing work, examining Hughs' life, poetry and sources of inspiration, is badly needed to put this major writer of the 20th century in true perspective."
5,Stunning,"Gorgeous cinematography and a chance to see some rare glimpses of the world. It opened my eyes to the nature of humans-- I saw how differently, and similarly, we all live amongst nature. A must have. I will certainly show this to my children (if, or when I have them)."
2,Strange Movie,"I am not sure what all the hype was about. This is a strange movie that is very disjointed and has a very odd flow to it. The music is also odd. I realize that it is suppose to be art, but I was expecting something that would be relaxing and this is not."
1,can't play in Sony SBP-300,"Any one else having problems with the 8k disc? Plays on other blu-ray players but not mine, Sony SBP-300 (and I updated to version 4.20 - the latest firmware)"
2,"A disappointing ""blessing""","After all the rave reviews, I decided I should give this film a try. Having now seen it, I guess I missed the ""blessing"" to which the film's title refers. Yes, the photography is gorgeous, and many of the scenes are esoteric and intriguing. However, the film's pace is glacial, some of the scenes go on way too long (especially the speeded-up urban traffic sequences), many of the scenes make little or no sense without at least some explanation, and I was unable to discern any sense of logic or connection in the sequencing of many of the scenes. When it ended, I was left feeling ""Is that all there is?"" An interesting experiment, but for me, one that doesn't deliver a satisfactory result."
3,Plagiarisqatsi,"If ""Koyaanisqatsi"" (which ""Baraka"" director Ron Fricke edited) had never been made, this film would deserve great attention. But Fricke re-uses so many of the memorable images from ""Koyaanisqatsi"" and so artlessly rehashes its style that one wonders whether lawyers were ever involved. The producers, interviewed in a behind-the-scenes documentary, also seem oddly dispirited. The poor DVD transfer -- obviously from an analog source and abounding with artifacts and interlace flicker -- reinforces one's disappointment. They even missed a great opportunity to provide alternative audio tracks or captions with descriptions of what we're seeing.This film deserves three stars nonetheless for stunning photography and the new wonders it does show us. One can't help thinking that even the fanciest digital artifice still can't compare to accomplished cinematogaphy of the real beauty of the world."
5,Baraka,One of the best documentaries ever. You do not need a narrator for this movie. Classic cinematography.
5,Best BluRay Cinema yet!,This is a must own BluRay if you are a Cinematography buff. The time lapsed video captured with the custom designed camera is unbelievable. Baraka also finds some of the most amazing places in the world. Check it out!
2,Pretentious is a word.,"This film is, to me, nothing more than an exquisitely endered screen saver. Its 'message' is simple, trite and after a while repetitive. It is a good advertisement for bourgois holiday makers looking for 'gritty... oooh magawd!' holiday experiences. A higher 'new age vacuity' quotient than should be allowed in a feature length film."
3,baraka is arabic word,I don't know about other languagesbut Baraka originally Arabic word more than 2000 years oldMentioned in Quran our holly bookand who ever wrote the 'Editorial Reviews ' don't have the guts to say itArabs are not ignorant we do have rich culture and heritage that no one can deny it
3,what is the point,"Great images great quality great scenes but what is the point, what is the message, is it that the earth is beautifull and that humans are spiritual but that we destroy the earth???? As the message was concernd i found it empty and very long take 20 minutes off and it would have been fine but god i was glad it was over and just started to consider if it was really worth the money. Give me planet earth from the BBC anytime. Not one smile of the people in the movie it was kind of deppresing, beautifull images but for some reason I felt deppressed watching it. The only real good scene are the ones of majors cities fast forwarded but at the end also way to long. No story line way to long way to depressing."
5,An astonishing and life-altering film.,"The most poignant and powerful film I have seen. This movie shakes the viewer from her comfortable seat and calls her to question not only the dominant paradigm but personal values and beliefs. Baraka should be seen by everyone because it has the ability to affect us all and calls us to question our lifestyles. The cinematography is incredible and the music is carefully crafted. Definately a film to be viewed on the big screen, but this should not discourage anyone from renting it."
3,Not cohesive,"Yes, the photography is beautiful, intriguing, sometimes disturbing (the chicks). But as a whole, the images do not hold together, and this is perhaps because the music itself does not hold together. At times there is no music and only the natural sounds one would expect, given the images. If I'd seen it first, I wouldn't've bought it."
1,Region locked,"Somehow I thought that region locking was past with blu-ray, but I was wrong. My first region locked Blu-ray disc. does not play on my european player. Whyyyyy?"
5,Baraka Blu-ray,"This review is for the Blu-Ray version. Roger Ebbert was right in his review when he said """"Baraka"" by itself is sufficient reason to acquire a Blu-ray player."". Most reviews before this date 10-30-08 are most likely for the DVD version. I have a 47 inch LG LCD 1080p tv and a brand new Panasonic DMP-DB35 Blu-ray disk player. It is hard to describe how good this movie looks on my TV. The movie has no dialog and is a series of scenes from around the world set to music. There is no computer animation in this movie but the movie was recorded on 65mm film. The video is the first 8K resolution video ever made of a 65mm film and each frame was digitally restored. the official web site for the movie is http://www.barakathefilm.com. All I can say is that you must see this film on Blu-ray to be able to appreciate how good it really is. Buy this movie now while you are thinking about it!!!"
5,Excellent,"Realmente apasionante, es un documental que vale la pena tenerlo, ademas el producto llegó en perfectas condiciones, lo que hace sin duda volverlos a escoger para una futura compra. Gracias"
5,Mind-boggling!,"Baraka will make you gasp, cry, shake your head, and smile. All with no dialogue and no story. Baraka is about the planet and how we humans fit into it.This film is almost a slap in the fact to some people who have become so wrapped up in their day to day lives that they have forgotten that they are a part of nature and that the whole world is interdependant. For others it is a celebration of the diversity of the earth. Finally it can be a wake-up call to what we are doing to our planet.Baraka is educational, but not preachy.... entertaining, but not mindless.... and finally - beautiful but not superficial.Watching Baraka should be a prerequisite to calling yourself a human-being.I just can't tell you how much I love it."
3,WHERE?!,I WAS TOLD THIS FILM HAD CAPTIONS OF THE LOCATIONS. BE INTERESTING TO KNOW WHERE! So someone please tell me where I can find the other version. I'll buy it again.
5,Needs to be Replaced Every Few Years,"When that ring starts to stick, it is time to buy a new ring and just have it on hand when needed. I always use Pam or vegetable oil on my ring to extend its like and make lid removal easier. Lids that stick because the ring is past its lifespan are a real pain to remove!If you can, make sure you have an extra that you can install. In the middle of canning, you can't stop to go buy, or order, a seal."
4,The real Conway,"Conway Twitty recorded a lot of good, even great, songs in the 1960s and after, but his 50s recordings as conveyed on this CD were gems. Musically and lyrically, ""Platinum High School"" is a true period piece for original rock 'n roll. Who but Conway could have rocked ""Danny Boy"" the way he did without making it sound ludicrous. Both my 17-year-old and 11-year-old boys love the music on it, which says something about its timelessness."
3,Listen to Lennon,"Like the musical genius John Lennon once said, ""The Stones copied us, did whatever we did two months later. Satanic Majesty is Sgt. Pepper, but without the success."" He was right, why I do believe the Stones first hit was a song the Beatles wrote for them called ""I wanna be your man"", BEATLES OWN THE STONES"
3,"Great Album, Average Deluxe Edition","Of course this is a 5-star album, but I already have the album. Compared to other Deluxe Editions from this period (the Who Sell Out, Who's Next,Live At Leeds [Deluxe Edition]), the documentation is really scant. The 12-page booklet advertised is basically album credits and some photos from the recording sessions. A little essay or something talking about the circumstances surrounding this ""exile"" (hello? the Stones take off to a French Chateaux to record an American-blues-style album?) would not have been that hard to pull together. The extra songs are amazing, but still--these special editions are supposed to be keepers (see Live at Leeds, etc.) as opposed to CD's you put on your iPod and then toss into the garage."
1,Exile on PAIN Street after listening to this tripe,"""Greatest"" album? What a load of hogwash! Though familiar with the Stones from the first time I heard 'Gomper' at a Masonic youth dinner in 1968, I really turned on to the Stones in 1986 when 'Winning Ugly' was burning up the Canadian charts. If you want some great rock music I suggest you check out Dirty Work or Undercover, or Bill Wyman's second solo album Stone Alone. Mick's first solo album She's the Boss is up there as well."
3,"good idea, but...","Good idea, but probably editor's wish did not come true, because in this record you can find both strong and weak points. Some of the tracks, for example, are really outstanding. ""All down the line"" is a powerful rock'n'roll, with a brilliant rythm guitar work; Jeff Lang's ""Sweet Virginia"" is probably the highlight of this recording, with an impressive sample of slide and fingerstyle acoustic guitar, which brings back Delta's echoes (a little masterpiece); a nice ""Tumbling Dice"", with southern rock calls and an incisive version of ""Rocks Off"", with a pure r'n'r solo in the final, complete the mentions. As for the rest, to be honest, the CD is quite modest and my three stars mark is the result of a balance.Riccardo FrauSassari - Italy"
5,The Best Album of All Time,"1. Exile on Main Street- Stones2. Blood on the Tracks- Dylan3. Good Old Boys- Randy Newman4. Frank's Wild Years- Tom Waits5. Sticky Fingers- StonesBelieve it, 'cause it's true."
3,Glimmer Twins Censorship,"The album is a Stones classic and gets 5 stars for the music. I rated it lower because, once again, Mick and Keith are trying to rewrite history. First they did it with the recent Rarities album by cropping the cover photo to eliminate Bill Wyman. Now they're at it again, but this time with one of the best rock 'n' roll albums ever. Like the Soviets used to purge any mention or images of Leon Trotsky from their history books, Mick and Keith are rewriting the history of the Stones by eliminating all photos of Mick Taylor and Bill Wyman from Exile's new packaging. The new booklet has NO photos of Wyman (He never existed!)and there are two photos of Taylor, but photos were carefully chosen so that he is unidentifiable (He is in the shadows or his back is to the camera). This is pretty petty stuff and the Stones fans deserve better. This Glimmer Twins revisionism needs to stop before they move on to their next projects, Sticky Fingers and Some Girls."
1,Not so hot!!!,As I've said above this CD is not so hot. The songs are all muddy sounding and the CD is too long!!!!! Whats the deal with the cover too???? I don't think it even compares to their latest No Security album. I really wish they would have polished this album up before releasing it. I'm putting this one at the bottom of my CD collection and poppin in the latest Mariah Carey album. That's good music.
4,Good but a bit repetitive,"My favorite is Happy rather than Tumbling Dice, the former being one of the most amusing Stones songs. Other good cuts like Sweet Black Angel and Loving Cup populate this album, but there gets to be a bit too much repetition."
4,No need to scrape your shoes,"Everyone should know how wonderful this masterpiece album is. The other reviewers cover that well. The sound on this remaster trumps those of the boxed set I reviewed in 2009. The beginning of Sweet Virginia is beautiful to behold. I ripped Sweet Virginia to the hard drive to see what the wave form would look like. There are a massive number of 0db peaks so it looks like this mastering job may have fallen prey to the loudness war. If you don't know what that is look it up in the Wiki [...]I'm a die hard Stones collector so I bought the Deluxe, Super Deluxe and the Vinyl editions of this. I would have bought them regardless. BUT as one of the other reviewers said I think Mick and Keith already knew that.So I give it 4 stars for the masterpiece that it is and one star off for the loud mastering."
1,"GREAT music,TERRIBLE sound","If you want to hear an excellent CD version of this classic,go back to the 1994 Bob Ludwig remaster.To my ears,this is one of the worst sounding reissues I've heard in a very long time..."
3,One of the most over-rated rock albums of all time,"The production is muddy, and most of the songs are forgettable. The entire album sounds like it was recorded in one afternoon, in a basement with very bad acoustics. The flat production was considered somewhat ballsy at the time: in an era when more and more albums were becoming ""artistic"" productions taking months or years, Exile on Main Street and its sort of...well...BAD sound was considered to be a deliberate rebellion against this. Or was it just bad sound? Hmmmm...."
5,One of my favorite albums,This is by far one of my favorite albums. It is an absolutely great addition to anyones collection!
2,I Dont Get It,"For the life of me I cant understand why the critics cream over this album. Its one one those albums thats really not all that good but at the same time very trendy to put on ones greatest of all time list. The album isnt bad , but it just isnt quite up to par with the likes of Sticky Fingers or Let It Bleed( two phenomenal albums )The first five tracks are actually pretty good , particularly Shake your Hips , Rip This Joint and Rocks Off. From there its all downhill with the exeptions of All Down The Line and Stop Breaking Down. the majority of the album is very mediocre ,and actually boring .. especially for a band with the prominence of the Rolling Stones .It seems to me that this is the Stones attempt at comming up with something akin to the White Album , and it quite frankly is not in the same league.The Rolling Stones have a slew of great albums ... this just isnt one of em"
5,Possibly the best,"This is one of perhaps three or four Rolling Stones albums that is truly a cut above the rest. No slick production, few asinine lyricisms, no teeny-bopper ""naughtiness"" involved.Anyone who feels this album is overrated need only consult the ratings for ""Tatoo You"" and ""It's only Rock N Roll"" to feel immediately chastised.Many people have a problem with the sloppy, slouchy, muddy, ambient sound of the album, but there is nothing to be done about it except to admit it adds to the atmosphere. Jagger's vocals, too often overemphasized, are forced to take a back seat to the superb instrumentalism of this album.If ""Start Me Up"" and ""Beast of Burden"" are your favorite Stones singles, you will hate this album with a passion, as it is the antithesis of those throw-away songs."
3,It's in the playing,The Stones kicked around in a basement in the south of France and emerged with this long piece of attitude. Can they rock? Of course they can. Are these great or memorable songs? Not really. It's fine playing if you're in the mood for grinding rock.
5,Still crazy after all these years,"Jemsum Crow, it really HAS been 27 years since this album came out! This is the one that shouldn't have come off; lots of sloppy playing, lyrics that are worse to dicipher than usual, bunches of filler tracks here and there, etc.. But the whole thing somehow works, from the chugging openings of ""Rocks Off"" and ""Rip This Joint"" to the ersatz country of ""Sweet Virginia"" and the more genuine country-folk of ""Sweet Black Angel,"" to ""Tumbling Dice"" to ""Happy"" to ""All Down The Line"" to, bro' and sistren, the list is endless. 27 years old and could've been recorded yesterday! A great album from, um, well, certainly, ONE of the world's greatest rock'n roll bands!"
3,overated and can't understand why,"Why does everyone think that this album is so great? It would have been better if they would have cut half of the songs out and made this a single album instead of a double album. Here are the songs that I think are great. ROCKS OFF, RIP THIS JOINT, SHAKE YOUR HIPS, TUMBLING DICE, SWEET VIRGINIA, SWEET BLACK ANGEL, HAPPY, ALL DOWN THE LINE, and STOP BREAKING DOWN. The rest of the songs that I didn't list, are not great Stones songs. So why do people proclaim this to be the best of their albums? I think people just want to jump on the bandwagon, because many critics have said this is a great album. In my opinion, it is not the Stones best. If you want their best, buy LET IT BLEED, BEGGARS BANQUET, STICKY FINGERS, or GET YER YA YAS OUT."
2,Another casualty of the loudness war,"With much respect to the album (among my favorites) and without causing any offense to those who like the sound of the reissued disc---the sound is not so much to my liking. Heavily compressed, just like the other 2009 Stones remasters. I have done back-to-back comparisons of the 1994 Virgin remaster and this one with good equipment. The dynamics have been squeezed out, and I found myself reaching for the volume knob to turn the 2010 disc *down*--which is a real travesty for such a good-time rock record. Perhaps due to the compression and EQ choices, there seems to be a tad more detail, with more emphasis on the mid-range (this does bring out Mick's vocals quite well, as others have said), but to my ears, the sound is harsh and fatiguing and a tad lifeless. I do wish this album would have been treated as lovingly as the 2002 ABKO re-issues, which are mind-blowingly good. I cannot comment on the bonus tracks just yet."
4,The Partridge Family,"Yes, the singer sounds like Andy Partridge, and he knows it. But as a fan of XTC from the days of 'Making Plans For Nigel' and 'Generals and Majors', I reckon this album by Dogs Die In Hot Cars is better than any single album XTC produced. Humourous as XTC were but more consistently bouncy and catchy, DDIHC are certainly a prospect, and this album is one of the best of the year. The three videos included with the CD are well done as well, and capture the off-kilter sense of humour evident in the lyrics."
3,The sincerest form of flattery...,"DDIHC get a lot of comparisons to XTC, and with good reason. The lead singer has emulated Andy Partridge's barking vocals to an impressive level, and the music seems to have taken every aspect of XTC's first 15 years or so and condensed them into a unified sound. Even the band's lyrics suggest extended periods listening to ""English Settlement."" I believe I even hear the ghost of Colin Moulding crop up every now and again. While they pull off a few catchy tunes (lead off track ""Godhopping"" is especially fun), chances are that the many forgettable tracks that make up the latter half of this album will simply inspire you to dust off your old XTC LP's and hope for the day they decide to come out of hiatus and record some new material."
3,Scholarly look at Synanon.,As the title implies. this is an overview of Syananon as a utopian community rather than as a drug treatment facility. The tone is scholarly but the author is obviously enamored of Syanaon. There is good documentation and this book could serve as a good start for those interested in the Syananon phenomenon.
4,Great Item!,These magnets were larger than I expected. Very good size and nice color purple. Strong magnets. Love this item. Very happy with these.
3,Drive Me Crazy will dive you crazy!,It's funny.... She has a few good ones but it's sappy for the most part. I ordered the CD for one song. It was big in the clubs when it came out.... It was worth what I paid for it....
3,Abridged Version,"The reading and voices in the Audio CD version are done well, and the story was enjoyable. It seemed, however, to be missing bits and pieces (e.g., incomplete character development, minor characters that seemed as though they'd have larger roles dropping out altogether), which wasn't consistent with my experience with the only other Heyer novel I'd read. As I was replacing the CDs in the case, I checked the back cover and confirmed that the Audio CD version is, indeed, abridged--a fact which is missing from the product description and is only noted in one of the editorial reviews (which I don't generally read in detail). While I'm sure the full novel is delightful, I'm only rating this at three stars due to the unadvertised abridged nature of this version."
2,Least favorite Heyer,I have read nearly all of Heyer's books at this point and this was my least favorite. I just didn't buy Horry as a character. She was boldly matter of fact and practical about the realities of an arranged marriage and then turned into a confirmed pea-goose once the deed was done. There are many wonderful Georgette Heyer's books to chose from - you should indeed chose another.
4,The Convenient Marriage,"This book is one of the earlier Heyer efforts, written in the 1930's. It is a mixture of the light-hearted romp (the young 17 year old girl)and the pleasant gentleman of 35 who marries her on her request. When Honoria marries Lord Rule she marries into the ton, goes slightly overboard with gambling and gossip, and gets involved with the villain of the piece, Lord Lethbridge who has an ugly history with Lord Rule and his sister. There are at least three young men who try to help Honoria out of problems she unwittingly gets into connected with Lord Lethbridge. They are definitely written as light relief. The book is similar to quite a few other Heyer books in that a young innocent lady gets into trouble with the world of the ton and is rescued by her husband, after many convolutions. It is amusing and easy to read.Linda Sheean"
3,Warning: This is an abridged version,"According to the Naxos Audiobooks website, this is an ABRIDGED edition of the Convenient Marriage."
2,Gravely disappointed...,"I'm really disappointed in this book. It's all over the place. I do like (enjoy) the Earl Rule very much. Horry is very annoying and idioctic. The story has yet to grab me. I'm waiting for ""it"" to happen and ""it"" has not happened. Not sure where the humor is that the other reviewers have mentioned."
3,I wouldn't recommend reading this novel.,"I would not recommend reading The Call of the Wild by Jack London because although it has its high points the lower parts are indeed low. While the brutal fight scenes keep you entertained for a brief period of time,the ending is slow and some of the reading seems irrelevant. There is a sense of bondage between dog and man in this novel but in some instances the events seem far fetched with Buck,the protagonist,always seeming to come out on top. A quote to support this is in chapter five on page fourty when John Thorton comes to Buck's rescue. He says ""If you strike that dog again, I'll kill you."" This is an example where any other dog would have been beaten to death while Buck gets out alive. This is a detailed novel with a good description of Buck's life but at the same time the reader,most likely,cannot relate to the story. The lower points of this story drive me to not recommend the reading of this novel."
3,Loyalty Goes a Long Way,"I really enjoyed The Call of the Wild because although it was not a book I could relate to, London kept the plot running smoothly and lively. The book rarely became boring. London used so many metaphors in his writing I got a real feel for the scene. He made it very possible to see the characters almost beyond the third point of view. London's use of detail helped the scene come to life. He used such descriptive words that I could almost get into the scene alongside Buck. London seemed to be showing the different levels of loyalty of both men and dogs through his book. He showed the absolute extreme circumstances loyalty goes. I really enjoyed learning about the Alaskan culture. This book depicted a perfect image of what it would be like to be out on a trail on a sled with a team of dogs leading the way. It was very enriching and enlightening."
3,Interesting...,"I read Call of the Wild because it made MLA's list of the 100 best novels of the last century, and because it was short and quick and easy to carry around.I can see how writing a novel from a Wolf's perspective would be compelling, and unique enough perhaps to land it on the list. And it's a good story, quick to read and engaging--excellent Waiting for a Bus reading material.I don't know if it's great literature--but the glimpses into life during the Yukon goldrush make it worthwhile, and it's so fast that there's no reason not to pick it up. It's not exactly a deep book, though-- if you're looking for hidden meaning, there really isn't all the much there. But, as I said, it's a good story from a unique point of view, and worth reading."
3,Very Simple and Quick,"Jack London's Call of the Wild was, to say the least, an extremely shallow book. London omnisciently narrates the difficult life of a dog named Buck in 217 pages. While the book was with out a doubt interesting, I fear it lacked substance. Its simple nature resembles a children's book but at times the vernacular would be difficult for a child to comprehend. At the same time, the introduction of characters is another confusing aspect as I found myself unable to conclude whether the new character was a dog or a person until five pages after their introduction. This leaves me wondering who his target audience was. It is with out a doubt too simple for an adult, yet too confusing for a child. The book definitely kept my attention, though, for I read it cover to cover in two hours. I suppose I would recommend Call of the Wild to middle-schoolers. They would enjoy the adventure and appreciate not being buried with themes and motifs."
4,pretty coo. not Amazing,"Prior to reading this book, I had heard incredible things about it, so when I finally started it, I thought it was going to be one helluva ride. The story was good, the characters were pretty good (and half of them were dogs), the history was good, and anything else I am forgetting to mention about the book was ""good"". Its not even close to being one of my favorites, for I have read a good many, but it is worth the time spent. If you are a dog-lover, if you are interested in the Alaska gold-rush, or just like an all-round action-packed adventure, then you will probably like this book. Just don't get your hopes up, because you could get disappointed."
5,I thought it was great,"I thouht that it was a good book, never letting you put it down. I liked how Jack Londen used such detail."
5,Great book,"Unbelievable book,I loved Buck as the main character. I'm definitely getting the movie. Most of the people I know got it.Ethan Rowles ™Age 9"
1,really bad,this book sucked so bad i think ill fart out my cornflakes. y not? ahhhhhhhhh. but now im hungry. ill go eat lucky charms.
2,The end was the best part,i hated this book. that is all there is to it. it was awful. do not buy it.
1,Modern day ignorance.,"Paperback books are different from hardbound books--you carry them around with you.Young people tend to, more often, read paperbacks.Also, the young person, and even the adult, will tend to study the cover and read the back of the book over and over. Even the introduction can be fascinating- I have a collection of the best of Jack London with an intro written by Eugene Burdick. Given all this, can you imagine having a copy of The Call of the Wild and on the cover is a picture of a German Shephard? The dog in this story is a St. Bernard and that is pivotal to the story- long hair dogs in california were being kidnapped for work in the frozen North. Anyways, as Mr. coselle used to say ""And there you have it, folks""Steve Kane"
3,My Review,"Thew the book Buck shows his capability in leadership, respnonsibility, and strength. I like how the book shows specifically what Buck had to do to go threw, in order to accomplish his goals. It relates to me and how I want to be successful. Yes, i know it is going to take a lot of work, but I am willing to put in extra effort to make something out of my self and acheive my goals, which is also how Buck feels. Buck and I have both gone threw many hardships and risks, but that is life and i am sure there is mant more to come."
5,Call of the wild,"Truly a deep book, only a man who himself experienced some of the things Buck has could write so inspirational"
4,"One More From Childhood, But Still Good!","This was the first book I read about wolves. When I was about 5 or 6 I received a copy but in an abridged format. From this beginning, it started me on a life long love of reading stories about wolves and wildlife.As in White Fang, this book has something for young and old alike. And don't let any of the movie adaptions keep you from reading it, it's SO much better than what Hollywood has done."
2,"A well written and descriptive book, but not in my interest.","In my opinion The Call of the Wild by Jack London is mediocre. My favorite part of the book is the in depth descriptions. For example, I really like the way that London describes Buck after he had been pulling the sled for awhile. ""His muscles had wasted away to knotty strings, and the flesh pads had disappeared, so that each rib and every bone in his frame were outlined cleanly through the loose hide that was wrinkled in folds of emptiness.""(London p.38) I also like the way the book is written and how it doesn't drag on forever. I do not like the beginning of the book because i think it is boring and doesn't grab the attention of the reader. I also think that the vocabulary is too tough and overall the novel is a bit confusing. Although personally I do not like The Call of the Wild, I recomend this book to anyone who enjoys a great adventure."
4,This is GREAT,"I mean I never read this book, I have a book report due for it in about 15 hours.....but thanks to the marvel of modern techknowlegy known as the internet this procrastinating, ill prepared student will have a masterfully writen report legibly completed by 8:00 tonight thanks to the countless summaries accumulated on this web site. I now have obtained an excellent way to make the grade with out making stress. Other than that i have found the theme to be quite interesting and enthralling. Had I the time, I probably would have actually read it."
4,The call of the Wild,"I have just reciently read the Novel The Call of the Wild. I thought it was an interesting book. I havent read many books, but I liked this one pretty good. I enjoy reading books like this.I mostly enjoyed the part where the dogs were pulling the sleds"
4,"Jack London's ""The Call of the Wild"" is an excellent book.","Jack London's ""The Call of the Wild"" is a detailed book for anyone who likes dogs and the outdoors. The book is very descriptive, giving the dogs human characteristics. One of the detailed scenes was when Buck and Spitz fought to the tragic end. London described Curly's death by saying, ""No fair play. Once down that was the end of you."" (London, pg.9) This shows how uncivilized the environment was. The dogs had to fend for themselves or risk being defeated. I liked the action of the book, but the setting jumped around a lot and it was hard to follow. I would recommend this book to anyone who has intrests in the experiences man and dog went through during the Gold Rush era."
2,Fifty years since I read this classic for the first time!,"No need to review the book - only I wish it had text to speech therefore, the two stars for the publisher, and not for Jack London! After buying this version, I found a free version that had text to speech. Great book! Brought back fond memories of a simpler time. Look for the free version first."
3,literature book,"The book is itself is ok, instructive and interesting and short. ideal for mu daughther, but unfortunately the book was not received in the best conditions; 5 pages were cut(tear)"
1,BAD BOOK,This is the worst book i ever read and the only reason I read it was because my teacher made me. if I had a choice I would of read the dictinary instead!!!
3,Required,My son had to read this. I have not figured out why kids have to read this book. I personally hate it but it was a requirement.
5,As good as the first time!!!,"My third read of this classic. Still great. Only book I have ever re read.....apart from white fang, of course!"
4,Call of the Wild,"This was a well written book about a dog surviving in Alaska working as a sled dog. I liked it because some of the scenes were similar to what humans do in real life, such as the struggle to become the leader of the team. This book was interesting and exciting the whole way through. I would recommend it to someone who loves dogs and the outdoors."
3,This book was about a dog named buck and his jorney,"The Call of the Wild by Jack London has many negatives and positives.The book is very descriptive.The way the author describes the Yukon and their hardships was one of the interesting parts of the book.In the last chapter Buck becomes part of the wild and hears the call,as stated on page 61.""It was the call, the many noted call, sounding mole luringly and compelling then ever before. And never before was he ready to obey. John Thorton was dead.The last tie was broken. Man and the claims of man no longer bound him.""Based on my opinion,one of the negatives of this book is the story is based on the life of a dog and not a humanbeing.Also,it seemed like some of the chapters dragged on and did not get to the point.Over all the book was very interesting and kept me in suspense.I would not soy it was the best book I've ever read, but I do recommened it."
3,A Review from Marcus Thomas a 8th grader,I really didn't care much for the book because I don't find books about animals with human characteristics very interesting. But it was ok and bearable.
3,The Call of the Wild,"'The Call of the Wild' by Jack London is about a dog named Buck who is stolen from his home in California and taken to Alaska. There he must learn to survive in the harsh conditions or die a painful death. I found the book to be a bit boring, because of the long descriptions and slow pace of the book."
4,The Call Of The Wild,"This book told the story of a dog named Buck who went through many homes. When Buck finnally gets to a place to stay for good, he is whipped and abbused and is forced to be a sled dog. it takes him a while to get used to the harshness of his new life. When he sees one of his friends killed by the other dogs on the team, the reality sets in. After a while Buck adapts and becomes the tough lead dog. He overcomes many obstacles to become the lead dog. I really liked this book because it teaches you that no matter what you do, you should never give up."
4,great read,"Got a Kindle and using the free books to read some of the ""classics"" that I missed in school. Loved the story. I appreciate that I can get some of these books and finish off some of my ""must reads""."
2,Be Careful Which Edition You Buy - Many Are Shortened Versions,"I was disappointed to buy the hardback book for my 12 year-old and find it was missing much of the story, and many vocabulary words are changed to simpler words for the youngest readers. Unfortunately, I purchased the hardback as gifts, placed glued bookplates inside the cover and now am back to buy the full versions. I think it should be REQUIRED that abridged versions be identified as such."
1,Company does not stand behind this product,"I purchased one of these vacuums less than 3 months ago and now see the hose is disintegrating. It has a series of tears in the folds all along the hose. I contacted the company about the problem and was told that we could buy a piece to fix it or buy a new vacuum. You purchase a major product like this you would expect the company to stand behind it, not want you to buy the pieces to fix what is their manufacturing problem.Beware this vacuum. It does not live up to its hype."
4,only a 4 because,"only a 4 because nothing is PERFECT. But I would recommend this vacuum, it does a great job pulling up the pet hair! Well built unit, generous sturdy cord, well made attachments...i'm saddened when i read comparisons to a eureka...simply not true. this is a very solid unit with a 2 year warranty (3 depending on where you buy it!). i think it will serve me well for years to come."
4,great for the price,My son used these gloves for football this season. I was not willing to pay the price for expensive gloves. These have been adequate.
1,Big Disappointment!,"After reading most of the reviews for these dog toys - I ordered 4 for all of the special dogs in our lives. We were hoping to get a very durable toy (and cute - which they are), but they didn't even last 15 minutes. Our Lab had the arms and tail off in no time. Our friends all reported the same thing. So - if you are looking for durability - look for another product!"
4,"'Phat' indeed, but lacks the vision of 'Leftism'...","'Leftism' was so ahead of it's time, following up such a masterpiece must have been an unenviable task. With tracks like 'Phat Planet' they pull blindsiders once more and thier ambient moments still feature (see 'Rhino's Prayer'). A great album that can stand up to a lot of stuff that that tries to pass itself off as electronica, just not quite as sharp as what came before."
2,Just doesn't compare to first album,"I wanted to like this album, but it simply doesn't compare to Leftism. Leftism was way ahead of it's time and is full of sounds that practially tickle your ears whereas Rhythm & Stealth is full of sounds that are ugly and not nearly as pleasant to listen to. This is my synopsis and apparently I'm not alone as this CD sells for much cheaper on the used market than Leftism.My advice? Don't miss Leftism but skip Rhythym & Stealth."
4,Good tea!,I love the smoky tone to this gunpowder green tea. No bitter after tase. I do like Numi's Gunpowder Green just a bit better so I'm saving my 5 star rating for that one! But this one is still delicious!
1,awful,Even a heterosexual should not waste their time on this book. The conversations are trite.These so called relationships are a farce.Was this book written by a lesbian or someone claiming to know anything about people of either gender? Read any book by RADCLYFFE and you will know about true lesbians.
5,A huge help,"This is one of those ""why didn't someone think of this sooner?' books. It's a clear, thorough path to finding your place in the dot com world. And most importantly, not losing that place when things go nuts with the Nasdaq. The steps are clear and it was also a fun read. I'd recommend this to anyone who's stuck on the question, ""How can I do what I do already...but in the Internet space?"" The answers are all here."
2,Great set but with LID problems,"I bought this set December 2003. After a year of use, the black ""painted"" rim under the lid has come off. I've always hand washed it, too. Also, I've noticed a couple of dents on the lid just from having it set on a drying rack.On a positive note, the knife is awesome, very durable and high quality. The non stick material is also great. The pot itself is very easy to clean."
4,The First Giant Monster Film,"We have to thank Doyle because not only is this a good film, but without it, there would be no Jurrasic Park. There would be no King Kong or The Beast From 20,000 Fathoms, and if they never existed, Toho would never have the idea to make Godzilla or Rodan! An expedition and rescue goes to an old uncharted island where they see the most unbelievable thing, a land of dinosaurs and a carnivorice apeman with a chimp that lures pray to him! At the time, these special effects were amazing and so realistic. I gave it 4 stars because of the terrible DVD quality."
2,A WARNING YOU MUST READ!,"Do not confuse the ""remastered"" edition with the (Restored edition). The remastered edition from A2zcds is 67 miniutes in length. There are no varying tints, as another reviewer has falsely lead people to believe. Coincidentally the same and only review as written by jenny (last name escapes me) is the only one that appears on the a2zcds website. It's entirely shown in sepia. But that's not the bad part, because it looks pretty good. The bad part is, it's recorded on cheap dvd-r. Yes CHEAP DVD-R and has the worst possible soundtrack that doesn't even remotely reflect the action that is taking place on the screen. Plus the only bonus feature is a2zcds schilling of their other dvds. Plus the price is a lot more than a lousy homemade dvd-r should ever be. Another thing that makes me mad is that you can only review one edition of The Lost World, because they lump all the reviews together. Restored edition= Very Good. Remastered edition= Bad, Very Bad."
2,"Great for the money, but very very low build quality","While the set does the job, and cuts everything very well...the knives are NOT presentable in the least. On many of the ones included in my set, the Sabatier ""crest"" on the end of each knife is actually glued in CROOKED. While they cut nice, they truely look like junk."
1,Sabatier Knives set,"It is not a quality product. As far as I am concerned it is a ""No Go"" at any price. Plastic Handles on Quality knives? C'mon!"
2,Not a complete set,"I ordered two sets for family gifts and both had one extra slot (or maybe one knife missing). I was very disappointed, especially that I didn't find out about this until my family members opened their gifts."
1,Used and incomplete,"I thought this was a great deal. But it was too great as it turned out. Not only was the set I bought (supposedly new) quite used, it was also missing the bread knife. Boo."
2,dull nives,i purchesed 20 peice cut wear' if they were sharp' they would be excelent' cant cut butter;' by bigmax
1,Why is Amazon deceiving its customers?,"Amazon.com claims these cheap, rust prone knives with plastic handles have a list price of over $200 a set.Why is Amazon deceiving its customers? Does Amazon think that tricking people into buying garbage will encourage people to invest in Amazon.com stock? Will tricking customers increase good will? Will tricking customers encourage repeat customers? If the answers to these questions is yes, Amazon should continue on its present deceiving course, if the answer is no, the head of amazon.com should purchase a quality set of Sabatier knive for everyone that purchased a cheap set of these knive and send the good knives along with an apology to everyone that was tricked by Amazon.coms false and misleading advertising!"
2,Not Durable and Not Worth the price,"Just one Christmas ago, I brought this for my 5 year old child. She had fun with it for about a week and then it broke. The plastic supports in the dollhouse broke without that it doesn't hold together. Now it's just sitting in my garage....I wouldn't advise anyone to buy this house."
1,Didn't do their homework,"While much of the information is correct there are glaring mistakes throughout. The authors seem to rehash the same words from other publications, neither bringing something fresh nor accuracy to this story.I feel if someone is going to write, whether for an elementary school child or a academic society they need to do their homework first and make sure their facts are straight. The pepuation of heresay with no substantiation is just not right!"
3,as expected but louder than I would like,"Overall it is what I expected except for the level of noise from the fan. I can't turn it up to the highest volume without turning my TV up also. Since the fan blows out the front of the unit, I have to turn it away from where I am sitting in the winter for it is very cold."
2,Returned item due to possible health risks.,"Had to return item because this HFD-110 IS an Ionizing air purifier (and you cannot turn this feature off), contrary to the Manufacturer's Description which would have you believe otherwise. Some popular ionizing air cleaners could be hazardous to your health, especial;y to new babies under 6 months old."
5,"Surreal, Uplifting, and Soul Soothing Music","I saw this when it was broadcast on public television, and I have been waiting impatiently for it to become available in the US. I have long been a fan of Gregorian-style music, but this is something so far beyond the ordinary monastic chant, it is difficult to describe. Gregorian, Masters of Chant, perform contemporary, modern music that everyone will recognize, but they do it in the serene and beautiful style of Gregorian chant. If you've heard any of their CD's, you'll know what I mean. But they take it even further in this DVD by adding the beautiful backdrop of a medieval castle, gorgeous lighting, and choreography. All these elements combine to both uplift your soul and soothe it at the same time. I will watch this DVD again and again and again.........."
1,ewww,"Overrated album. Please The Stones can't play music at all.Look at the art cover of this CD. What are they? GAYS?? I think so. At least put the picture of a girl wearing jeans.Don't buy this. There's so many great albums to be heard. Don't waste your time on the Rolling Stones. It's just a tourism journey in rock history. That's it.Charlie Watts, someone give him a little of blood.Bill Wyman, bye bye.Keith Richard, try to kill yourself with drugs.Mick Jagger, fill your mouth with gum and shut up.Brian Jones, the only musician in there, died."
5,Right up there with Beggar's Banquet,"This album is right up there with Beggar's Banquet. I haven't heard Let it Bleed, but I imagine that's good as well."
4,"Has ""Sweet Jane"" original - worth it just for that song","Heard this in a record store and when the original of ""Sweet Jane"" came on, almost passed out. These guys, there's just no words for that level of talent and incredible song writing."
1,OK,"To the reviewer who asked why Beatles fans attack the RS.Maybe you should ask the opposite.Go to any Beatles review and youll find stones fans galore attacking the Beatles out of pure jealousy.Fans of the Beatles are generally very secure,its the Stones fans who are usually jealous and bitter.Why?I dont know. Maybe its there(beatles)inate superiority that bugs them I dont know.But overall this is an OK CD."
5,Sticky Fingers. The Rolling Stones,"Great album. Another one from the golden era 1968-1972, 'Brown Sugar', 'Sway', 'Bitch', all classics in their own right but the jewel is 'Can't you here me knocking', a true great. I truly suspect that Charlie Watts enjoyed himself the most on this track, mixing Santana style rhythms with jazz. All in all another brilliant album. Mick Taylor is so inspirational on this album, he's on top form and I think even Keith Richards admits that he learnt a lot from him."
5,The Stones at Their Best,"I've never been a big Stones fan but this album is great music. There are mixes of country, jazz, blues, soul and rock in this album which makes it one of my favorites albums of all time. A must have for the music lover."
1,Why ruin a great LP,"In this day and age , why would anyone compress the sound levels just to gain a louder pressing. The virgin pressing is better. Someone needs to step in and redo the Stones catalog properly."
4,GOOD PRICE,"Works wonderfully for dry chapped hands and rough heels too. Same great formula, but too bad they changed the Original Scent. The Original Scent had a nice perfume-like fragrance, but this New Scent smells like a man-product. Next time, I'm getting the Unscented one instead."
3,Not what I expected,"This is a nice compact toybox, I was expecting it to be a little bigger. When it is full with toys(which is not a lot) the sides do buldge so I would say it's not the strongest. The price was good so overall I am satisfied."
5,Great buy,"We bought this for our 17 mo old daughter who's toys were everywhere. The capacity is the entire length, height, and width of the toybox itself, all of her toys fit inside. Now at 19 mo. she has started climbing onto the toybox (she thinks it's funny to scare me) the plastic is very sturdy and the top shelf is even sturdier, which also has a gritty like texture for tread for ones who like to climb. I love how the door lifts up and slides back out of the way. Only thing is, the toybox is so deep that if she tries to lean in to get a toy from the bottom, she gets stuck teetering on her belly and can't lift herself back out. However, I do not see that as a danger (supervision of course). I'm also very pleased with the rounded edges, which was THE selling point for me."
4,step 2 toy box,"i bought this toy box for my (...) son because it matched the table and chairs. i wasn't overly happy with it. the toy box isn't as big ans i thought it would be, it doesn't hold all that much. i do like that it has a flat surface on the top and we keep his lamp on it bout over all i wouldn't buy it again for alot of toys. it is very rugged."
3,Great toybox but IT'S A SUFFOCATION HAZARD,"After watching my two year old crawl repeatedly into this toybox and shut the lid on herself, I realized that it is a serious suffocation hazard. I promptly got out my drill and drilled holes into the back to ventilate the toybox. The holes do not compromise the look, function, or integregity of the toybox at all but sure provide this mom with some peace of mind. The manufacturers should construct this toybox with some small holes in the back because it's useless to reason with a baby about the dangers of crawling into a completely enclosed place and shutting the lid. If you buy this toybox, DRILL SOME HOLES INTO THE BACK TO LET SOME AIR IN. Too many kids have died by playing in refrigerators and other enclosed spaces."
2,Incomplete,"I am very dissapointed that this CD doesn't include all of the Hermits US (or UK, for that matter) hits. It lacks their best song ""This Door Swings Both Ways"", but includes the lame music hall tunes ""Henry the 8th"", ""Mrs. Brown"", and ""Leaning On The Lamp"" as well as the ""I'm Into Something Good"" wanna-be ""Can't You Hear My Heartbeat"". This CD should be at least 25 tracks and include at least a couple of LP cuts. Unfortunately, their do not appear to be any Hermits CD collections that have all the US top 40 hits. Stand-out material on this CD are ""I'm Into Something Good"", ""What A"", ""Must To Avoid"", and ""No Milk Today""."
5,Great Book,I have worked in Psychiatry for more than 35 years as a Psychiatric Nurse and have read many text books. I was quite pleasantly surprised to find a book that is so informative and yet reads like a novel. The illustrations and examples are very realistic and describe quite accurately the behaviors and situations we deal with on the unit on a daily basis. The author has clearly had hands-on experience. I highly recommend this book.
4,Helped My Allergies but is expensive ...,Due to the expense I simply started eating more frozen vegetables and reduced my red meat intake. My allergies improved substantially and I have dramatically decreased my sinus infections and taking of allergy medications. My primary allergies have been related almost solely to pollen and mold.
2,Good Movie - Poor transfer,"This is not a review of the movie - other than to say it has been one of my favorite silents for over 20 years. This DVD, by Image from the Killiam Collection, seems to be from a somewhat deteriorated positive print of the movie accompanied by a rather mundane organ music tract. Image themselves, released a Laserdisc copy from the Rohauer Collection with full orchestra music in 1989 that was far superior. Hopefully they will be able to re-master that on for release on DVD in the future."
2,Kids Bop: Dance Moves,This was a birthday present for my 7 year old and the DVD arrived with scratches and we could not get it to play (3 dvd players and portable dvd player). Think before you buy this product and try to find something better.
5,Go on and let it rock,"Best live album ever recorded. This is the album that opened my eyes and made a huge impact on my music choices for life. This album originally introduced Seger to the world. It captured the sheer energy that the Silver Bullet Band was known for. If I was stranded and had one album to have and to hold, this would be the one. Songs such as the Beautiful Loser/Travelin Man medley with Nutbush City Limits brought Seger out of the doldrums of his Beautiful Loser album and these versions just rip it. The loneliness of the wailing sax in Turn the Page is worth the entire price of the album. It truly captures the old time rock with the promoter urging the crowd which one never hears any more. This should be in everybody's rock library."
2,"Bob Seeger "" Live""",The remastering took the'LIFE'out of the LIVE performance. Very disappointed in this remaster.I believe anyone would enjoy better the vinyl turned into a disc.
5,live is best,"I reckon that there are only two records you really need for your Bob Seger collection.Nine Tonight is one, Live Bullet is the other.The current 'Greatest Hits' is pretty good too (let's face it ALL Bob Seger is pretty good), but can't match the energy in these two live performances. I'll leave to others to argue as to which live concert disc is the better. For me, I'm happy enough to buy, and play, both of them."
3,Remaster Issues???,"First off let me say that I LOVE this recording! For 28 years I have just dug this thing to death ... its real rock and roll ... but I have to agree with ""doublehighc"" (below) that there is something strange about this remastering. Yes, it is clearer, but there is an odd sometimes unsettling quality to it that pops up now and then.Note this particular version (one of those mini LP things ... no plastic case) came out October 5, 1999 and that there was another remaster of Live Bullet released on December 7, 1999. Perhaps that was a correction? There are no negative comments concerning remastering under the 12-7 release?Regardless, I highly recommend this album ... even with the mastering quirk this thing kick booty!"
2,:),"this is one of the all time best ""live"" albums of all time...bob seger can rock the crowd like no one else...you can ""feel"" every word he belts out..awesome...!!"
5,Incredible Cookware!!!,"Finally, a cookware line that adds style to functionality! I finally do not have to hide my cookware in the cupboard because it looks so great. The nonstick is fantastic and the shape of the pan offers the most versatility for anything I'm cooking. Thanks Calphalon."
4,Great cookware with longevity!,"I'm an avid cook so when I got this set as a wedding gift almost 8 years ago I was thrilled. They have been a joy to use. Not only did they perform perfectly but they are also a very good looking set. They have been mostly used by me but other household members also. I mention this because not everyone is aware of how to care for them. I have always taken good care of them but have caught others abusing them eg. use metal untensils, hand blenders, or put them in the dish washer. So with some occasional mild abuse and after 8 yrs., the interior of 3 of the 5 pans/pot has started to flake and peel.Caphalon has said that their hard anodized nonstick cook ware has a life span of 10 yrs. I think under these conditions the brand has lived up to their name. I am now in the market for a new set, I will be purchasing Calphalon again because I am happy with the quality of their product!"
3,Calphalon Pots,"Received on time, however when I opened the box and unwrapped each pot, I noticed that the large 8 quart soup pot lid had a small dent on the metal rim and the smaller of the two fry pans had scratches on the exterior. The handles do get hot when cooking. I have handled, stored and hand washed these pots per Calphalons instructions and they still scratch easily. Also after cooking in the 8 gt soup pot just twice using wood utensils, I found a scratch in the nonstick coating - not impressed at all."
2,unique setting can't overcome dull storytelling,"**1/2Despite its exquisitely photographed and exotic locale, ""Ten Canoes"" is strictly for those who still need a bedtime story to help them fall asleep. Set in the Australian outback, this tale of life among the Aborigines is as beautiful to look at as it is tedious to sit through. As we watch a group of men building canoes, a wizened but droning narrator spins an ancient yarn about a stranger who wanders into a village, forever altering the lives of those who live there (interestingly, while the scenes in the past have been filmed in color, those set in the present are in black-and-white).""Ten Canoes"" may have value as an anthropological study of sorts, but its desultory pacing and lack of compelling drama make it a very dull slog indeed for even the most adventurous of armchair-traveling moviegoers."
2,Not so good...,Sunlight darkening gave-up after 4 years... (now they are a yellowish tint)The foam around the lenses are comfortable but needed to be replace.The strap connection is delicate and need to be replaced often.
2,sailin' Frigate,"good old historical romance. Essex, one of early u.s. naval frigates, followed through Barbary and War of 1812. David Farragut served on her as midshipman at age 9. Later 1st admiral in u.s.n. (damn the torpedoes.)One used to learn history from such books. trip down memory lane."
3,Unhappy,"Musically I would give this CD 5 stars. However, I am unhappy that the extra tracks included on this 'enhanced' CD are only accessible via a PC. It is annoying that there is all this extra music (single A & B sides etc) which I can't hear unless I'm sitting in front of a PC. (Maybe I'm old-fashioned but I don't enjoy listening to music while sitting in front of a computer screen with a mouse in my hand). The music which IS accessible on a CD player is only 38 minutes long so I can't see why the extra tracks weren't added in the conventional way."
1,I wanted to like it...,"... but it just isn't very good. Rowland's self-indulgent singing style is too grating for their strong horn section to cover up. He's all over the friggin' map. The song writing is mostly forgettable. I have to say I can't understand why a few people love this album so much. It's such a far cry from the band's inspirations (per the liner notes) - the 1960's soul greats in America. I actually like their/his next album, Too Rye Aye, but this was disappointing. If you want UK soul go for Van Morrison."
4,most impressive,"I enjoy the Traditional Hawaiian music on this CD. Originally released 26 June 1972, this superb remaster of ""Young Hawaii Plays Old Hawaii"" is album No. 1 for the group Hui Ohana, writes Mr Bill Murata in the liner notes. It is astounding to me to read that ""none in the group has had any formal musical training. ""We learned music Hawaiian style"" -- from relatives at first then mostly self-taught. All three musicians are in their early twenties and at the begining of a musical career which continues more than thirty years after this album's release. Mr Dennis Pavao displays impressive vocal control on these songs, especially E LILIU E. Mr Nedward Kaapana plays a frimly planted bass in support of his twin brother, the now legendary Ledward Kaapana. Mr Led Kaapana already demonstrates an adept skill with hawaiian slack key guitar styles. If you are interested in the nascent stages of one of Hawaii's true living legends of their native music, this CD will interest you."
5,Top notch item,"I use this all the time...all the time! When it says ""nonstick"" that's just what it means! It wipes cleans in a jiffy and I couldn't be happier. It was well worth the price...and it's something I'll have for a very long time! I can't find one thing that I don't like about this item...and I've been involved in the hospitality industry for well over thirty years. Any chef would covet this griddle. The size is just right. I have a glass top stove, so my comments are based on that...I have not tried it on any other surface. I'm tickled pink!Packing was just fine."
2,Wish mine were as good as some say it is!,"I purchased this griddle because my old electric griddle had worn out. I wish I had purchased another electric one instead of this. Mine has hot spots that are the bane of anyone who fixes pancakes. My grandsons have been very understanding about the burned spots on their pancakes, but I am not."
4,A Teenage Outcast Thinks She's in Love,"A young teenage girl feels like an outcast in her own life. She is being brought up by her father who was widowed at the girl's birth. The girl has only one friend. For some reason, she becomes obsessed with a singer she hears on the radio and feels like he will be the love of her life. She machinates a way to hear him perform live but does not know how to get his attention. She has an epiphany. By carving the letters of his name on her forehead, he will pay attention to her! Unfortunately, she carves the letters in mirror image, backward. What happens next? You will have to read this wonderful novel to find out. It is definitely worth the short time it will take to read it."
2,Skip this one.,"I picked up this book because I've read two other books by Anne Tyler that I greatly enjoyed, but I was disappointed by this one. Maybe it was written before she really hit her stride as a writer. While entertaining, the book seemed somewhat empty. I didn't find the characters' actions very believable, and the ""surprise"" ending did not follow from anything earlier in the book (as all really good surprise endings should). The virtue of this book is that it can be quickly read in one evening. I do recommend Tyler's books ""A Patchwork Planet"" and ""Earthly Posessions."""
2,Pathetic... I feel so bad for Evie Decker.,"okay. right now I am doing a review of this book for my english class. Its too bad that I had to choose the book I was to review before I read it. The author's style in this book is pathetic. The only thing I can say the author has going for her, judging souly on this book is that she is very good at characterization. Her characters are intended to be pathetic, and indeed, they are."
2,Sad......,A very sad and depressing book about an unhappy teenager. I wouldn't recommend it unless you like feeling worse than before you started reading.
1,Stay away!,"I've never read any of her other work, so it's actually possible that the author of this book is as awesome as all the reviews posted here say. However, I have read this book. And it's not awesome. In fact, it's achingly far from being so--stupid characters, snail-like plot, and a complete lack of insight into anything. I think reading it may have killed brain cells I can't afford to loose.If you're interested in groupie/musician relationships, I suggest getting yourself a copy of Bye Bye Baby: My Tragic Love Affair with the Bay City Rollers."
2,skeletal compared to other great AT books...,"I found this book to be lacking. In character development, plot, etc. It just never really went anywhere - not that it needed to but it just didn't grab me as her other novels have. I found it to be very underdeveloped. Perhaps, as one other reviewer wrote, this was before she hit her stride? That's what I think."
5,Over and over,"Congratulations fellas ! You've got an awesome CD. I listened to the first song and thought it was very good. Well usually on a CD, you might get a couple of good ones. I listened to the rest of the songs. They are all great! My favorite is ""Another nine minutes"". Anyone who has to get up in the morning and go to work will love this song. There are slow ones fast ones a good mix. I really like the fact their songs take a tough situation in an upbeat way. This one is going to be a biggie in the next couple of months. People that don't normally listen to country will like it. I think they have a little bit of ""Alabama mixed with 38 Special"". They are just as good in concert also. This CD is very addictive. I listen to it over and over!Thanks, Steve"
4,Servotron in the Mix,"WAIT! STOP! Do Not Exit! Unless you buy this CD. Servotron remixes with the club atmosphere in mind are here on this collection of audio mind control units designed to subvert the human race. I love every song on this CD, I just wish there were more."
5,A Fascinating Look at the Old Hollywood Studio System,"""The Making of the Wizard of Oz: Movie Magic and Studio Power in the Prime of MGM--And the Miracle of Production No 1060"" is just downright enthralling. It is an expose' that breaks down the machinery and the machinations of what it took to get a major movie made in the days of the autocratic studio heads. The book offers an entertaining and totally engrossing look at the legendary film. Judy, Ray, Jack, Bert, Margaret, and Toto, too, are all analyzed in this brilliant work. The songwriters, the respective directors, the many other craftsmen, as well as the ""little people,"" in more than the figurative sense, are all here. Vividly embellished with stills from the production, the book's text is just as captivating. The familiar as well as the unfamiliar stories about the production make for a most satisfying read for any ""Oz"" fan. It is also a good primer for anyone with an interest in pursuing film as a career."
4,A birthday gift...,"I bought this for our son who lives in NM. He enjoys sitting in it in the evenings in the shade. The only problem that he has had was not the products fault. He gets some pretty good winds coming through his porch, so he has to attach it to something to keep the wind from blowing all over the place. Not a problem, just as little inconvenience."
1,Sunshines: The Astrology of Being Happy,I was very disappointed in this book -- so much so that I returned it which is something I rarely do. It just seemed superficial and glib to me and I was very surprised that it received such good reviews from professionals whose opinion I respect.
1,not up to expectations at all,"don't get me wrong, i love michael lutin. i read his horoscopes every day and have even bought forecasts from his website. but this book is very superficial. first of all, i thought this was a book about the nodes but it only talks about sun signs. the nice thing is that he goes through those signs degree by degree; unfortunately the descriptions aren't very profound or interesting.the second portion of the book is even more non-specific. there are sections on things like wealth, relationships, etc and he talks about 'finding your true north' and 'where things go south'...but as far as i could tell this advice was not tailored to any given planet or node placements. not enough astrology, too many platitudes."
5,Happy Reading!,"A bright and delightful book written in an easy to read style of witty banter with just enough dark sarcasm to make you exclaim, ""Omigosh! Is that really me""? Easy to find profiles on all signs and a special bonus--an extra personal section based on the year you were born. This book has something new and a bit different--emphasizes that the moon, the lunar nodes, have as much to do with our lives as our sun sign and gives detailed explanation. Also includes suggestions on how to change our pathway of making repetitive poor choices (heading south) into choosing better choices for each of us (finding our true north). Makes a great book for personal reading, as a gift, for the coffee table, and would be excellent to find in a doctor's/dentist's office!"
4,I like it,"I have wanted to watch this film for quite a while! It wasn't what I expected, but I thought the film was good. I enjoyed it. I found it interesting, and very inspiring! It has motivated me to start working on my own art again. Who knows...if they ever decide to make a Handmade Nation II, maybe I'll be a featured artist!"
4,Great as set,"This table works great! My 2 yr old is learning how to sit at a table during meal times and this table is so light it can be moved onto the tile floor to minimize the mess. She loves putting things in the little drawer and the chairs are stong enough to support my husbands weight so you can sit with your child. We have the Step2 kitchen in the same design, which we also love and it makes a great set for a play room."
2,"Desk and ""chair"" set - chair not at all sturdy",My son had fallen over several times before we threw out the white chair that comes w/ this desk. It is not a very good design and is dangerous.
4,Great Table,My son received this as a present from his grandpa. He is 3 years old and really loves this little table. He eats on this table as well as does crafts. I love the plastic durability and he loves the little drawer to hide things in.
1,chairs keep falling over with the kids in them!,The chairs seem to be too tall and narrow that my kids both have fallen over and hurt themselves! We no longer use them...some chairs I bought at the dollar store work so much better! I wish I would have never bought it.You also have to screw in the legs and if you don't get it just right the legs wobble.
5,Gorgeous table & chair set!!!,"We had to have this table & chair set to go with our Step 2 Lifestyle Deluxe kitchen set. It is very durable and will last for years. It can be used for play time or to do homework at. I just wish the drawer couldn't come out all the way. We were having a hard time finding a child's decor to go with this set to decorate my 5 & 6 year old daughters' room, but we finally decided to do Disney's Little Mermaid with it. The green matches her fin great! I'm going to find Little Mermaid stickers to go over the pictures of fruit in the green squares on the kitchen set. Now we just have to get the matching storage chest and desk set to go with it."
2,Wish I'd purchased something else,"We purchased this table for our 2 and 4 yr. old boys. The table was difficult to assemble as the holes for the screws do not line up correctly. When we finally got it together we found it to be very unstable. The chairs are too tall, and fall over easily. The legs come out of the table making it completely unusable. Our boys haven't touched it in months. This table is a huge disappointment."
3,Chairs tip over,"We received this as a gift when my daughter was 2. This set is not designed for a 2-year old. The chairs are much too narrow and high, and tip over very easily. My daughter is now almost 3 and still can't very effectively get in the chair by herself. She has hurt herself several times trying to get in or out of the chair and having it tip over on her. On a good note, however, the set is sturdy and nearly invincible."
3,Hoping chair suggestion works!,"As I read several comments before writing my own out of curiosity, I see most everyone has the same issue. These lovely chairs pretty much injure any child who touches them in some way shape or form. I do love the set overall in practicality, ease of cleaning, and have had no problems with it for over 2 years, and my son is now 4 - still loving it! (other than the chair issue...) He has mastered using the set carefully, but we monitor anyone under the age of 3 on or near the chairs as they always get clobbered with them or fall off them. I am hoping the suggestion of adding sand to the inside works...I will attempt that project in the near future! Best of luck in your purchase!"
1,waste of money,"i bought this table and chair set for my 2 year old son. I have a few problems with it, first of all the chairs are horrible they tip over very easily my son has fallen off a few times.. Second problem the drawer pulls all the way out why would you make it that way????? And last but not least the top of the table raised up making it uneven... If I still had the box I would return this product in a heartbeat.... save your money...... After i wrote this review i contacted step 2 and they were very helpful. They sent me out a new table top and two new chairs, which they claimed to have revised... we will see what happens"
2,Only women can genuinely love,"Kawabata's 'Snow Country' is a geisha story.One of the main characters of the book, Komako, had to sell herself in order to pay the medical costs needed for the treatment of her lover's illness.One of her clients is the rich good-for-nothing Shimamura.They are attracted to each other, but love or even genuine human contact seems impossible for them.All those facts are told more or less indirectly between poetic and melancholic descriptions of snow landscapes.This novel was first published as a newspaper serial and contains some unnecessary repetitions. Also, the end is not convincing with a fire as a deus ex machina.I found this novel too vague, too impressionistic and too loose.For a more moving and realistic portrait of a geisha I recommend 'Autobiography of a Geisha' by Sayo Masuda."
4,Distilled Beauty...,"I'll keep this short and sweet like the novel. It's been brought up constantly that the prose is akin to a haiku in its simplicity yet depth of meaning and that's a perfect way to look at what is known as the masterpiece of this Nobel Prize winner's wonderful career. At the heart of the story is an ill-fated love affair between two people who know that it can never work out. Somehow, the backdrop, what gives the book its name, becomes another character in this tale that often reminded me of Ha Jin's ""Waiting"" and to a certain extent, ""Kokoro."" This is the type of book that has to be digested slowly as you are apt to miss much of what is going on if you zip through it the way I did the first time I read it. Once you have a second go you can see the intricacies of the love affair and the way that Kawabata deftly presents each of his characters. Don't read this on the subway - relish every moment sitting back during a long cold night."
1,Absolutely terrible,"I'm being generous with the one star rating. I would've given it a zero but a rating that low is impossible. There was no plot to this book. The action is so subtle that it is impossible to follow. And the ending with the observations of the Milky Way, what was that all about? It made absolutely no sense. There was no point to this book and I must say that reading it was the biggest waste of my time. There's several hours of my life I'll never get back..."
4,Goodbye Audio Adrenaline,"After about 15 years in the Christian music industry, I'm sure most were sad to say goodbye to these guys! ""Adios"" This greatest hits collection is nothing but the best with several of their number one hits. Even thought this collection is from 2006, I recently bought it for the song ""Big House"" which I heard on Pandora. When I bought it, I was new on the Christian Pop scene and had no idea it was an older production. Even though this collection is older, it still fits in with todays contemporary style as if it were newly produced. This CD offers a little bit of everything from upbeat dance style to gritty and blues style. I have enjoyed this CD over and over and I hope you do as well.Adios - The Greatest Hits"
4,i disagree-they're a terrific band!,"....If you're fond of the Punk Rock and Roll you'll really enjoy this,their first and finest IMO on the defunct AMPHETAMINE REPTILE label.They have alittle psychedelia flavor in their guitar sound,but it's not overwhelming and makes for a unique listen.-maybe why they picked the Arthur Lee song to cover.The vocalist's stylings are the best part-the guy sorta makes up his own language-i know it's been done before(Melvins & others)but it's never been this fun and over the top.I just got the AC/DC tribute ""hell ain't a bad place to be"" and Lollipop play the poop out of Girl's Got Rythem!Anyway how are they gonna suck-ass if they made the cover of Flipside? Come-on-now-wont'cha hey!"
4,their best one to date,it kicks butt from over the edge to big house if you have any of their other stuff you will enjoy this one
2,are you kidding?,"love L.A. Guns, but i don't think the band even likes this record.outside of ""Over the Edge"", ""Some Lie for Love"" and ""It's Over Now"",Hollywood Vampires is really bad. as an e.p., it's quite good..."
5,guns guns guns,"vampires is great, same great flavor of the first two albums, but a little more refined"
4,different,"I was really suprised when i listened to this cd for the first time, and ultimitely decided i really liked it. Its definitely different from anything CC has ever done before. i am a huge fan of all his music, and although this cd is a pretty big step away from his EPs, i am happy with it. hes made his music a lot more assesible(?)and i think thats great. Dont wait is definitely the standouthere, and i like so long so long, i do think the original version is better, but this is good too. the only grudge i have on this album is slow decay. why oh why does everyone have to sing a song about iraq. i am in the service, and damn im sick of it. plus the fact that the song just has nothing to do with the rest of the cd and is like a big speedbump. anyway, hats off though, maybe ill start admitting more i like these guys!"
1,another step back,"'a mark, a mission, a' whatever was not what i would call a good cd, but it was listenable. this new release is nothing of the sort to me. the step back for carrabba was when he stopped with the acoustical writing. the last two cd's have both gone away from that and they both regressed in quality. i was so dissatisfied with the last cd that i wasnt even going to buy this one but then came the $3 off with a student id and i figured it was worth $5, turns out i was wrong. frankly until i got on here and saw the reviews i hadnt heard a good thing about this cd from anyone and was expecting more of the same but since that isnt the case i feel it is my duty to inform the would have been misinformed that his cd is not good."
4,"Good album, not their best.","This album is probably the most marketable and radio friendly of all of dashboard's albums. For the peripheral listener it may be the right one to get to introduce you to this band. But as a Dashboard fan of 5 or so years I truly hope they return to their original sound for their next work. Not for the listen-ability but for the show. To this day the fans react best to the songs from ""Places"" or ""A Mark, A Mission."" I recommend this album to everyone but I also recommend any and all of their other work."
3,Watch,"The product was excellent, bu the package was terrible, the box the watch came in was not the correct box, so the it was broken, I did not want to resend it because I will have to pay for postage to resent it and have to start all over again, also I need the gift the same week I got it in the mail."
4,Beatifull songs enpowered by DTS,"Songs are beatifull by themselfs, but DTS encoded they sounds remarkable. In ""Roll it"" sounds rolls from front to back and fills a whole room. Echoes are very natural and stereo sound that proccessed by receiver with its effects not even close to what You hear here! Unfortunately, few strange decisions had been taken by editors during DTS mixing - some sounds comes from unnatural directions. If You have this disk, You won't regret."
2,Audio Download a Problem and no contact on the site,"I downloaded the audio of this from the /redeem site listed on the card but there was a problem extracting it and I needed to download it again. I go to the site and there is NO contact information for support to resolve the issue, bummer!!!"
4,Review question,"Album is a perennial rock great! However, I have the remastered 25th anniversary edition of this.Is the audio on the 2010 release that much better? Is the sonic difference enough to warrant buying this album again?? Awaiting your responses!"
1,Bad Amazon handling,"As far as the cd music is concerned, it's what was expected when purchased. The downside is the handling of the merchandise at Amazon. The package on arrival was unscathed, not even a dent in the cardboard. But upon opening, the case was smashed and pieces of plastic fell out all over my lap...............nice!"
2,"Great album, disappointing vinyl","I'm not going to spend time reviewing this album as an ALBUM; we all know how it placed Paul McCartney back on top of his game critically.My problem is with this vinyl re-issue. The pressing is simply not very good; the second the needle lands on the vinyl I am treated to numerous clicls, clacks and pops. I don't know if all copies are this bad. I can only hope that the future McCartney vinyl remasters will be of better quality otherwise Concord goes to the lower portions of my opinion on vinyl re-issue companies."
3,"Warning : Early DTS CD - Good music, bad mastering","The ""Band on the Run"" DTS CD is one of the earliest DTS releases. It is a 4.0 mix (that's right, no center or LFE channels) based on a quadraphonic mix from the early 70s. It also sounds like the equalization is for a quad record rather than a DTS CD - extra treble, very little bass. The DTS CD starts earlier than every DTS decoder can ""sync up"", so assume you won't hear at least the first two notes of the title track.Obviously the ""Band on the Run"" music is some of the best and has been critically aclaimed for decades.Hopefully this will be one of the first multichannel SACDs or DVD-Audio discs released by EMI. Until then, while seriously flawed, this is the only multichannel version available."
2,not the best McCartney album,"This is not the best McCartney album. It's far from this. The only great track is Let me roll it. Rest is barely decent or plainly horrible. Every previous solo Macca album is much better than this. I would recommend underrated Wild Life which blows this album away with just two great songs (Dear Friend, Wild Life) or imaginative Ram (short masterpieces like Ram On, Dear Boy)."
5,The Band Runs Great (and gave us the booty!!!),"I'm proud to have this Deluxe Set with audio that's been remastered as impeccably as The Beatles remasters from 9/9/09. I'm proud of the band's achievement behind it, the spark of creativity and the flame of perseverance that remained integral to the project while confronting scary and intimidating traumas. I'm really proud of Paul, and of myself- for making Paul and his art a part of my life; As Voltaire so wisely observed,""Appreciation is a wonderful thing: It makes what is excellent in others belong to us as well.""Thanks Paul, Linda, Denny, and Geoff Emerick (recording engineer)."
2,Overrated Classic Not Helped by Second Disc,"I love Paul McCartney, but I have always thought that ""Band on the Run"" is his most overrated recording. Don't get me wrong; it's a sharp, professionally performed and recorded disc, but most of the songs are merely okay, though the music is almost always better than the lyrics (a McCartney hallmark). Disc 2 would be a fine one-off radio program, but doesn't stand up to repeated listenings, and was misleadingly pre-promoted."
4,I learn more from the reviews of others about Barbra's politics,"First- the album has beautiful music and the songs tell a story, for they are chosen to reflect the path both her and her new husband took before meeting.I was rather surprised reading other reviews concerning her socialistic stance, etc. Whatever her political inclination is, I belive the reviews should help us calibrate the extend of quality of the cd.Well Im in my early 40s, so this is a music that for me, it carries a message, it relaxes, and makes you think about love."
5,I've Dreamed of This!!!,"Ms. Streisand's voice has never sounded better and her choice of material on ""A Love Like Ours,"" is unique, original. This album has so many stand out songs I can't get the melodies out of my head! This is the best cd I have ever bought."
5,A Beautiful Journey,"If you want to indulge yourself in some classic Streisand material, treat yourself to A Love Like Ours. It's fabulous. Her voice is mature, rich and smooth--it simply soars."
3,SO-SO,"This is a mix bag for me. Barbra is in good voice, she sounds sincere - no matter how shmaltzy it gets - and she doesn't drown in production this time. But missing is some fire (besides Just One Lifetime)& excitement of what we expect from her. It's fine to be laid back and calm, it produces some of her most unforceful singing in years - yet their is a sense of recycling, maybe tiredness. Barbra was never that inventive in going beyond her tastes on picking material (though the younger Barbra was much more daring). I hardly believe she'll change her ways now, but if she plans to continue to record and appear she has to find other ways to be original, since that's what made her famous in the first place. A Love Like Ours was recorded by a helluvah singer, but it is a bit too mediocre and if it weren't Barbra it wouldn't gain so much attention."
2,"OK, she still sounds better than ANYBODY, EVER.","But, and it's a big BUT, the song selection and arrangements will make you instantly diabetic. By the end of the second cut ""Isn't It A Pity"", a great, slightly-bluesy Gershwin song that I couldn't wait to hear Streisand's ""take"" on, I was already getting nauseous. It's all THAT sweet, destined to be a hit in dentist offices and elevators everywhere. ANY of Barbra's other albums (listen to ""I Never Had It So Good"" on LAZY AFTERNOON) have more interesting love songs than this collection. Sorry, Barbra, if this is what being married has done to you, you need a vacation."
1,This CD must be a bust...,Looks like there's no sample tracks to be heard here. It's either because Barbara is now *too* good to let folks first sample her music before buying or the music is *too* average. I suspect it is both factors at play.
2,Bab&#65533;s Ballads to Brolin,"Ugh. Like eating a too sweet dessert, the lyrics of these songs make even a middle-aged romantic choke and blush. Love the voice, am definitely a fan (ADORED Higher Ground) but unless you're wanting cooing and gooing, you might just want to pass on this one."
4,A nice CD that showcases Streisand's continuing talent,"Streisand's new cd swoons with luscious music and vocals. Some may think that singing about love (on all 12 tracks) is a bit much. I think it's refreshing to hear this collection of nice, soft ballads."
3,Barbra is back....,"Streisdand's longly awaited love theme album is here. The opening song is marvelous..brought me to tears........some of the other material not up to par...some of the other songs just so-so....""The Music That makes Me Dance"" from Funny Girl on stage was also magnificent. Barbra you have been away too long!"
4,WONDERFUL CD!!!,"The first time I heard ""I'VE DREAMED OF YOU"" I experienced the sensation of been flying across an endless heaven with clouds and with a shinning sun... obviously I have a person in my heart, and I felt as the song has written to us... Believe it or not, the song has some magic!"
5,Kudos to Barbra!,"I have now listened to A Love Like ours three times through. I rate this album at five stars because Streisand once again comes through as an extraordinary artist and performer. Her voice has never been purer or clearer. She also gives us a wide range of musical styles: jazzy, adult contemporary, soft rock, and even a hint of her show-tune past (The Music that Makes Me Dance). I would recommend this album to any Streisand fan or to anybody who enjoys good, clear singing. This album once again proves that there is no equal to Barbra Streisand!"
1,"ANOTHER 'TUNELESS"" CD FROM BARBRA STREISAND!","BARBRA STREISAND SHOULD HAVE TITLED THIS ALBUM ""I ADORE JAMES BROLIN"" OR ""OBSSESIVE STREISAND""."
2,Not one of her best.,"I was suprised at how much most of the album sounds the same. It's hard to tell where you are on the track. I am a true fan, but there are only a few wonderful pieces . It is a disappointment."
3,Buy or buy not. There is no maybe,"I was hoping this book would provide information on the various 'film codes' used in the film (such as colour and shot symbolism, style of music, frame composition, costume etc) and how they enhanced the actual story. There is none of that in this book; however, it does provide 'a fly on the wall' insight into the production of the film. It relays conversations between Lucas and his producer, as well as recreates dialogue between Lucas and his actors as they move through the filming process. Glorious pictures, but you can get the same images from the net if that's what you're after. The book didn't provide me with what I wanted, but the Star Wars nerd in me liked it nevertheless."
5,Awesome!!,This book is really awesome! It takes you through day by day of the making of the movie starting from when George Lucas started talking about it with his designers to the end of post production! I really enjoyed the actual filming part. It takes you day by day with details and interviews with the actors and staff. I really love it! It really gives you an insight to the behind the scenes of what it takes to make a movie.
3,GOOD BUT DISAPPOINTING READ,"MS MCKECHNIE HAS WRITTEN A VERY HONEST BOOK ABOUT HER LIFE AND CAREER, BUT IT COMES ACROSS MORE AS A ""CLIFF NOTES' VERISON OF WHAT MUST BE A FASCINATING STORY, AND LEFT THIS READER WANTING MUCH MUCH MORE. SHE OFFERS FRUSTRATINGLY LITTLE IN DEPTH ACCOUNTS OF HER VARIOUS THEATRICAL EXPERIENCES, ESPECIALLY IN THE CASE OF A CHORUS LINE - A SHOW SHE PERFORMED WELL INTO MIDDLE AGE OVER A PERIOD OF 15 OR 16 YEARS. IN ADDITION, HER TUMULTUOUS RELATIONSHIP WITH MICHAEL BENNETT IS, LIKE THE REST OF THE BOOK, AN OVERVIEW MORE THAN AN ACCOUNT. MY OPINION - BUY THE BOOK USED OR TAKE IT OUT OF THE LIBRARY...NOT WORTH THE PRICE, AND VERY FRUSTRATING DUE TO WHAT IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN."
3,"actual dimensions: 6"" x 7"" x 1""","the person that mentioned the dimensions is incorrect. When I received these the dimensions were approximately 6"" x 7"" x 1"""
4,"Great replacement filter, and hard to find!","Great replacement filter for a great little air purifier! I had been unable to find these for about a year and a half. Glad I didn't toss out the purifier itself, because now it's back in business!"
2,What's The Point?,"I'm not sure why Joni would release yet ANOTHER compilation... itdoes make one a bit cynical. Unless it's to fulfill some kindof contractual obligation, it just seems a bit, well, greedy. Abig point is made that Joni ""hand-picked"" these songs, but shedid the same thing less than 10 years ago with the ""Hits"" CD.Anyone who is a fan will have either the individual CD's or thebetter ""Hits"" compilation, which has all original versions asopposed to the lame orchestral ""re-interpretations"" which endthis CD. Those remakes show Joni in declining voice and smothered in gooey strings. It's not a bad collection, but anyone interested in discovering the really top-notch Joni works would be better off looking elsewhere."
5,Best of the Best,"It's readable, engaging and all about psychodynamic practice. It's by far the best book I've read in this field."
3,Quite strange and sexy,"A seemingly mild-mannered editor of a muscle magazine finds his sexual desires ignited when he becomes involved in an S&M relationship with a muscular bodybuilder in this sexually explicit, extremely controversial drama. For, during their lovemaking, he is unable to control his pleasure/pain and in a fit of sexual intensity, cuts off his lover's arm. He is sent to prison, is released and (with the detached arm in formaldehyde) searches the dark city streets for his now one-armed object of affection. A homage to Pier Paolo Pasolini, the film is quite strange and sexy. (Japanese w/ subtitles)"
4,Give time for their new season,"OK, so it's not Odyssey and Oracle, their '60s masterpiece which came in at #82 in Rolling Stone's top 500 albums of all time. And, yes, the string-heavy production sounds more schmaltzy than baroque. At times it's sabotaged by a production that's more generic '80s than 1960s or 21st century. But this new one's still worth it. Rod Argent writes well developed and evocative melodies. The lyrics are grown up. And Colin Blunstone owns a spectacularly unique voice. If anything, he sounds stronger than ever, though sadly less breathless. Hey, it's a man singing - he can't be 25 forever (neither can we). So listen to him soar on Don't Believe in Miracles (the only non-Argent song here). And here's a pleasant suprise - this album builds in strength so that by the end, you're glad you bought it. Take it for what it is and enjoy."
4,It's good,"Pretty good. It has at least Rock n me, and Take the Money & Run.It's sure Steve Miller's second best to Book of Dreams. I wouldlike to try it out some time."
5,"Calphalon Contemporary Nonstick ""Everyday Pan""","This was a gift for my wife; she has already used it a half-dozen times in the couple of weeks that she has had it, and she loves it. The Calphalon product is not inexpensive, but the durability and functionality make it an excellent value. She is pleased to be able to add the 12-inch ""Everyday Pan"" to her already prodigious collection of Calphalon cookware."
3,Calphalon Cont NonStick EveryDay pan: mostly thumbs up,"This is a great nonstick pan for almost any family meal. I had ordered a Cuisinart version and sent it back as the cover, and handles got really, really hot. The Calphalon says it has stay cool handles. I have some other Caphalon fry pans with the longer handle and they are trully stay cool. This one, however, the handles do not stay cool. They did not get as hot as the Cuisinart ones, but they do get hot. I need to find one like this with trully stay cool handles. For now this is great, that is the only drawback."
5,Truly an Everyday Pan you will love,This pan is everything that I wanted and probably more.I love the non-stick finish and it is easy to clean. Cooks wonderfully and is easily transported with the two handles.
2,"Don't think, just do","A programming environment is much like writing a book or painting a picture. You can be shown step-by-step how to write a specific paragraph or paint a specific object, and make them with little variation... or you can be taught the concepts behind them, and use those concepts to make your painting, writing, or program actually your own.Ravi Mendis takes the step-by-step approach to show you how to make something, without spending any time to explain the concepts behind what its being shown. In my opinion, this 'teaching' style is little more useful than just giving people a CD full of code for completed projects. If you're not going to explain what the code does, why it does what it does, and how to use it, how are you going to know how to use it?Also, this book is poorly edited: sentence fragments litter the book, as well as spelling errors. At times, it can be very difficult to read."
5,ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT!,This CD has touched my heart deeply! I especially like the song He Strengthens Me! I listen to this CD a lot and it is very uplifting (I sing along with it while I'm doing my housework)! Looking forward to the next one! Thanks!
5,INCREDIBLY MOVING SONGS!,"THIS IA A BAND TO WATCH AND LISTEN FOR! IF YOU HAVEN'T BOUGHT THIS CD YET--DO IT! YOU WILL LOVE IT! THE SONGS ARE VERY MOVING, AND THE SINGER HAS A BEAUTFUL VOICE! 2 THUMBS UP!!!"
1,DVD not playable,"Unfortunately, this dvd is defective and won't play correctly. Be careful when purchasing a used dvd - I won't do it again. Seller would take dvd back but I had to pay mail costs both ways."
5,Great film,"Great film, great score, good actors. This is a movie I higly recomend, If you are into coming of age movies, this one a raw and a delight to your sences.About the purchase, preatty normal, no hassles."
2,"Good Idea, Poor Design","I have 2 of these devices. They work great when they work. The brains to this is a strain gauge, inside the top, attached to the hanger. When the squirrel gets on it, the gauge deflects activating the motor. The gauge does not last long at the needed settings. After about a week, the device starts spinning at a slight breeze and does not stop. The batteries leak in it also since it is not sealed well."
2,Breaks,I should have realized before I bought it that there is a design flaw here. The acrylic cracks the first time you put it on and I have a pinhead. I can only imagine it would snap in half the second a man or someone with big hair tried to use it.
3,Great pan.....small problem tho,This is a really nice pan....perfect size etc....but the lid does not fit. Tried to get through to Amazon to report this problem but for some reason I cannot connect with them on this product. Have others had this problem?Grandma Nancy
1,Makes the Taoist Yoga too complicitated,"I have found much more to-the-point books on Taoist yoga techniques.....Its kind of If I ask you the time of day I don't want to learn how to build a watch. Otherwords there is way too much fluff in his writing. All Mr. Chias books together could be condensed into 1 well written book... Also this Author attempts to mix christianity and Taoism which is not impressive, which is on the tape of this book. There are better sources for the information"
1,Coasters,"These are totally useless! Get the regular DVD-r Memorex and stay away from these ""printable DVD's"". Bad News!!!!!"
2,Zero effect.,"Seems like a well made product but unfortunately it didn't work for my girlfriend... now ex... I guess it's just one of those things. It obviously works for some, but is definitely no miracle cure."
2,so so,The author seems more concerned with course organization and pedagogy than with teaching the subject.There are times I wish she would just get on with it.
2,As French books go...this one is the worst,It was unorganized and muddled. I had a hard time learning anything. My school no longer uses it for that reason. I don't recommend you buy this unless you know French and are just trying to expand your basic skills in no order. I was so confused.
3,Timeless Love,"When Sam is thrust back in time by a magical charm after wrecking her dad's precious BMW, she finds herself in the middle of the court of the Tudors. She herself is a close ""advisor"" of Edward VI! The book documents her trip through time and its effect on the world.I love history and romance, so I thought I would love this book. But it wasn't the greatest I'd ever read. The beginning of her stay in 1553 was dragging by halfway through the book and her emotions were not really shown. One minute she would be hysterical and want to go home, and then the next minute she didn't seem to care. Some parts were detailed while others were vague. Her character was not consistent. Then she only met the guy she was to fall in love with (and my did they fall in love pretty fast) near the end of the book. I guess the idea of how her meddling changed history was interesting, but the end was just plain weird. This book could have been a lot better."
3,Good? Depends on what you need.,"If you're looking for an excellent primer on what a ""thin-client"" network is, or why you should buy Citrix's solution, this is a great book to read. Provides a very good high-level (not as broad as ""executive level,"" but not as detailed as a programmer's reference) overview of the Citrix platform, what it provides, etc.If you're looking for a more detailed study guide for the certification tests, look elsewhere. Actual screen shots are few and far between, and the book doesn't even mention Citrix's certification program. If you already have the gist of Citrix's platform and need to buckle down for the test, find another book."
1,To many basic networking concepts are presented,"I bought a book about CITRIX not basic networking concepts. Any Network Admin/Engineer installing CITRIX should stay away from this book. It is designed for those who do not understand networking, RAID, the registry etc. I expected CITRIX meat and got 400 pages of material anyone buying the book should already know."
5,iPod mini flip case,"I bought the Targus AEB04US Flip Case and am very pleased with it. Not only is it a very nice leather, but it's extremely strong and durable, protecting my iPod completely. I highly recommend this product."
4,"Excellent Performance, Pricey, Obtuse","The performance of this product is excellent, mostly due to the Black Berkey filtration elements. They are amazing.I took one star off because the plastic housing of the Berkey Light is overpriced. The filters cost about $100 for a set, meaning they charge $109 for the 2 plastic containers and the spigot which make up the Berkey Light. Maybe I got unlucky, but the containers do not snap together very easily and once together do not come apart easily either. Every time I do it I'm afraid they will break. It is a bit cumbersome. For $109, the quality of the plastic containers seems a little cheaper than expected.If I were to do it over, I might more seriously consider one of the stainless Berkey systems instead of the Berkey Light. Still, this is a great product."
1,One of the dumbest movies I've ever seen,"Its either an unexciting superhero movie or an unfunny comedy, but it definitely fails at both. The acting is horrible (especially the Seth Rogan). The dialogue is mundane and the plot so thin its ""transparent."" Rented this on Amazon; what a waste of time and money."
2,RIP Green Hornet,"While the Green Hornet might have made it out alive by the skin of his teeth in this movie...in this viewer's world he died a horrible lingering death. The Green Hornet could have been an awesome movie if the characters had been given some respect. This was suppose to be a movie about a hero. Yet, not a single heroic action occurred in this film. Even Kato who was the highlight of this feature turned out to be no more than Rogen's glorified babysitter. And what the heck was Diaz doing in there?!!! The fact that they had an age reference for her ""twilight"" years just made it even worse. Loved the car, the costumes, and Kato - other than that this movie packs about as many bombs as the car itself!"
5,This Movie is Great!,I don't know why so many people have complained about this movie! This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. I have already seen it more than three times and it's great every time. It's funny and full of great action scenes. I recommend it!
1,what a pile of crap,"This is the first movie in a long time that I actually quit watching half way through and returned it to redbox. I'm usually a fan of Seth Rogan, but I think he needs to stick with the dumb stoner parts and nothing more. They could have made this a powerful dark night style of action movie with a lot of mystery, suspense and a true feeling for the characters, but it falls flat on every level. You have know concern for the main characters and the story seems pointless and boring...ehhhh"
1,TEDIOUS & POINTLESS - $130 M WASTED ON JUNK,"A mish-mash and hodge-podge of half-baked notions and confusing set-pieces and laboriously lame atempts at humor. The two leads can't act and seem uncomfortable in the extreme. Cameron Diaz looks cute but has nothing to do. James Franco pops in briefly, probably relieved. Terrific actors Tom Wilkinson and Christoph Waltz do their best with the inept script (again Rogen).An opportunity missed to not go back to the 30s and do it in the pseudo-serious style of the great radio show.$130 million wasted and no one at the studio with enough creative nerve to say ""this stinks."" Sad."
1,The Green Hornet,"This movie was not only stupid and done horribly, I give all movies a 1 that DVD manufacturer/producers have started making the consumer buy Blue Ray to view any of the extra features. Worse, they have a menu and sub-menus of extras. Each one taking you to a message that says you have to purchase Blue Ray to view. What? You weren't making enough millions on DVDs? I will NEVER purchase a Blue Ray system. DVD is just fine with me. I can't afford, nor will I let any producer shove formats down my throat. How possitively rude. Boycot these fiends!"
1,awful movie,"The script lacked in originality; the cast didn't match the characters and the characters didn't match the founding idea; for a comedy, the humor left much to be desired; and the actors failed to portray believable characters.This movie was an epic fail.:("
1,WHAT SCRIPT?,just want to know where was the script for this movie? the longer this movie went on i found it to be almost like they filmed this with an outline and the rest..........or should i say ALOT of this was filmed as adlibe. a really pitty it could have been so much better.
5,Very funny and just FUN!,"I'm amazed at how many people are having such hostile reactions to what I thought was a very entertaining movie. I personally don't go to a superhero movie looking for high drama, complicated character development, etc. It's a SUPER HERO MOVIE for Pete's sake! I find it a bit disconcerting that so many take these films seriously. Throughout the movie it's blatantly obvious that it's not intended to be serious in any way, shape or form. My husband and I popped into the theater on a whim during a very stressful period in our lives, and we wound up getting exactly the type of respite we were looking for. I laughed my a-- off and thoroughly enjoyed myself. It's a lot of fun and I recommend this movie! It never ceases to amaze me how a truly horrendous film like Transformers can get high marks (one of the absolute worst films I've ever been subjected to), while movies like this one are panned."
1,green hornet,"this movie stinks, it only showed a few things i like 1. image of Bruce lee 2. the car flips over. 3. costumes were pretty good. this movie was a comedy all the way. nothing real serious. like it should of been i hope someone remakes it like it supposed to be."
1,"GREEN HORNET FAN 60""S","I WAITED FOR THIS MOVIE HOPING IT HAD SOME RESEMBALANCE TO A SUPERHERO LIKE VAN WILLIAMS AND BRUCE LEE. THIS DESTROYS THE IDEA OF A CRIME FIGHTER, WHAT KIND OF HERO RUNS AWAY FROM TROUBLE. THIS GUY ROGEN IS A TOTAL JOKE FOR A HERO, WHO WOULD GO INTO BATTLE WITH A WIMP LIKE THAT. AND TRENDLES KID OUGHT TO BE ASHAMED OF THIS PIECE OF TRASH. ONLY THING I COULD SAY GOOD WAS THAT JAY CHOU WAS THE ONLY POSSITIVE PART OF THE WHOLE FILM. Ahhhhhhhh"
1,another Sony release with cinavia corrupted audio,"This title is reported as another Sony release having an audio track corrupted with cinavia imbedded audio markers. We pay for lossless audio on a blu-ray because we want pristine, uncorrupted audio - and cinavia pollution does not meet that criteria.Save your money for a quality title from a different studio - do a cheap rental of this one if you are determined to see it."
3,"Fun, mindless entertainment","A serious story it isn't, but then again, did you expect it to be? It is simply fun, mindless entertainment. Some of the lines are very funny and the special effects are fairly well done. Good to watch when you just want to take your mind off of reality."
2,too corny,"The green hornet radio brodcast from the 40's was very serrius comparred to this movie ,the tv serries was also better than the batman tv program with Adam West , both from the late 60""s .The movie I just watched that was released this year on dvd, starring Seth rogan was a joke ! and a huge dissapointment to green hornet fans every where , the only thing good about this movie was the action and the performance of Jay Chou as Kato !"
4,Loved it,"I don't understand why it's so hated. Of course, I didn't have to deal with crappy 3d conversion that people saw in theatres. I thought it had a good tight plot, funny, well drawn characters and some pretty good fight scenes on top of that. I guess if you're looking for Green Lantern (but why would you be) this would be a disappointment. This is a super-fun movie I will recommend to all my friends."
1,Absolutely Horrible,"This movie does no justice to a Pulp fiction classic. Cato is the only salvagable character, but even he was not enigmatic or mysterious enough -- too American. And Rosen, why him? Horrible casting.it completely sucked."
1,Very junky,"I agree with a couple of the other reviewers, the 1966 TV show had a better feel for the Green Hornet then this concoction. What the heck is this movie? I knew it wouldn't be that good when I saw the trailer with Seth Rogen hamming it up. The lure for me was, hey, it's a superhero movie that could potentially capitilize on a unique comic hero. Brit Reid was way too much of a clown. Nothing even closely emulated real life situations. Kato, with better material could have worked. It (the film) should have been called Kato! What a waste of my time.Let down again by another ""hip"" reconstruction of a superhero. Cameron Diaz picking up a paycheck, Seth Rogen being indulged, and blank charactors wanting to make something happen sums it up. If your into The Green Hornet, check out an old Now comic for an interesting take on it. Great audio but so what if I can't connect a film to it."
2,"Thank You Seth Rogen, for turning Bruce Lee's legacy into...","A complete piece of trash. The thing is, it could have gone either way with just a little bite more intelligent writing and some actual martail arts choreography. Compound the fact that they let Rogen near both the dialogue and the kung fu and you've got a ""flop"" on your hands.Rogen is brilliant in his traditional endeavors of gastronomical humor. Really, I've enjoyed some other films he's been in immensely. There's so much potential here, it could have been Scott Pilgrim meets the Green Hornet and everything would've been sensational. Scott Pilgrim in case you don't know takes a rag tag band of nerds, in a musical band of nerds, and pulls out chop socky action that drips from every pore of the experience. How they did it, is a mystery, but it's clear Rogen didn't follow the formula.Before it was over, I was begging for it to end. You're not missing anything by spraying the raid on this hornet's nest."
4,good but not great,"I was captivated by The Green Hornet (1911) when I saw the trailer on YouTube last year. I waited for the price to come down and I ordered the dvd. Although I enjoyed this movie, I felt that is wasn't as well made as I thought it would be. Sure, the neat car with guns on the hood and other special effects were great, the gaps in the continuity of the story made me feel as though someone had cut parts out of the movie... maybe they did! This might have happened to keep the movie within a reasonable length! I think not. Maybe I expected too much. After all, I'm 78 years old and was attempting to recreate the radio days of The Green Hornet! OK.. it was a fairly good effort and I did enjoy the movie."
1,Just plain crappy,Don't waste your money! It is beyond stupid and never should have hit the screen in the first place. After watching this it will go in my collection and never see the light again!
2,Let down,I missed this in the theater and wanted it when it came out in dvd. That right I'm a greenhornet fan at least of the tv show. The previews look great. What a let down other then the special effects storyline is stupid and weak.
2,Very difficult to read,"The content seems good here but the book is very difficult to read. I found that I had to stop and think about every sentence, every paragraph, to grasp what was being said b/c it is filled with jargon that I am not familiar with. Would be better if written in ""plain english""."
3,Cheap and effective,"Not particularly comfortable in shorts, so I just tucked the top strap out of the way. They're cheap and not particularly durable but they work quite well for short projects."
5,Our Lady Peace's Newest Album,"This CD is amazing. I've never heard a CD with every single song giving you goosebumps when it hits the chorus, like this one does. WOW! If you like any music, then you'll love this. Great music, great beats, great lyrics, a true master piece."
3,"if you're not a long time fan, then skip this one","what gets me mad is that all the people who have just heard OLP play on the airwaves for the first time are judging them as a ""one-hit wonder"". I mean, i'll admit Happiness really isn't their best. In fact, it's anemic in comparison. OLP has been around for awhile... and Naveed is brilliant so if anything, get that disc instead!"
4,The lyrics are astounding.,"The first time I listened to this CD, it didn't seem so great. But after a while, I realized that the reason this CD is so impressive is because of the lyrics. The lyrics are very deep and honest. Especially in ""Happiness & the Fish"". This CD is proof that OLP has grown a lot since ""Clumsy""."
5,The best.,"I got this cd for christmas and its my favorite of all time! I wanted it for songs like, ""is anybody home"" but i think every song is great. Ive never seen a cd before where i liked every song but this one is!"
3,"Okay, it's not that good","The only good songs are the ones we've already heard! That's why I sold the cd. Our Lady Peace is just one of those bands who puts out all their good songs and has a whole wack of bad songs on the rest of the cd! I hope Gravity is better, cause their Canadians, and they deserve respect, and I respect them, cause Canadians ROCK! So DO AMERICANS! But please, try to avoid this album, and Clumsy, Naveed are the same way, Spiritual Machines, I haven't really heard anything on it, except the obvious 2, so I couldn't say, but I think Somewhere Out There is a great song so I sense some improving with OLP, besides, their due to have a good one soon, they RULE!"
1,Monotone,"My friend has this CD. I kind of like OLP (some of their songs from Gravity) but this CD is so monotone and boring. I was listening to it in the car and 3 tracks into the album I wondered if it was still on the same song because they all sound the same!!! The only song that slightly differs from the others is ""Theif"" Overall, this CD is a letdown. If you want to be gritting your teeth through an entire album because it is so monotone from song to song, then buy this."
4,Something missing,"This is a good album but has something missing that makes it a bit hard to listen to. However it's imperfection doesn't matter as it is still a good lively album that's well worth the money. (Preview Potato girl, highly recomended! )"
1,Hated it...,"I guess it's true that you really do get what you pay for. I thought I had found a steal when I saw this veil listed at $14.99. I saw it listed at $120.00 previously, so I thought I'd take a chance. Big mistake. This veil looked nothing like the picture...the satin edges were much thicker than they appear in the picture and it made the veil look very cheap."
4,How do I love thee? Let me count the cubes...,"Took the advice from previous reviews here at Amazon. Couldn't be happier. Incredibly easy to use, very fast in making ice. Don't believe that this thing is quiet, though. Fan is quite loud when making ice, which in my 5-member household is just about all day long. You get used to it. It's not a deal breaker, but you may want to plan where you put this for the sound, and for the size. I was pretty shocked at the size (it does not fit between my countertop and my cabinets), but appreciated it later because of plentiful water/ice capacity. Anyway, follow all the advice from others above regarding initial cleaning and you'll be thinking of all the trips to the store just for ice that you won't have to take anymore! Enjoy!"
1,Actually it's only a 0-star book.,"you know what i can sum up my whole opinion in two words ""its stinks."" its a piece of shit.the author should be beheaded for writing and publishing such gibberish. its not worth a dime."
5,DESIREE,"MY GRANDDAUGHTER LOVED THE V-TECH, SHE PLAYED ALOT WITH IT TO START WITH. THANK YOU FOR SENDING IT SO PROMPTLY."
5,Gantthead's development guide rocks!,"This pocket guide is great. What a nice extension of Gantthead's web content -- and I can carry it around! From high-level information gathering to detailed modeling, this guide contains to-the-point, well explained (and as importantly, well-diagrammed) development technique descriptions. For us consultants, it's a great quick reference. For an entire project team, it's an easy way to see that everyone's talking the same talk when they are tackling their development tasks. Plus, you can always get more details, examples, and actual deliverables from their web site. Very useful stuff."
4,good ifo book,This is a great reference book. It is very interesting and written in a manner to help understand the reason for the book
5,A satisfying read.,"While I'm only just halfway through this book -- after purchasing it only a day ago, I couldn't stop reading! -- I can say I highly recommend this book. While not a ""reference"" book in the sense that I will go back to it for how-tos and guides, it is filled with gems of information, quotes and story snippets. This is the sort of book you go back to again and again for encouragement and inspiration. I can hardly wait to finish it."
3,"Good reference, a little complicated.","I have worked with this book for a year now. It is a good reference to keep around at the time you are taking a german course.It is not very easy to use, because of its organization, but nontheless, I believe it helps to clear a lot of questions that students may be afraid to ask because they fear it may sound stupid."
1,defective product?,"We tried to get it to lay down flat but the bottom and top kept curling up. We made several attempts to get the glue to activate properly, including soaking the entire roll in the bathtub but had no success. I have never had such a difficult time with pre-glued border. We ended up throwing it in the trash and repainting the stained walls of our daughter's nursery."
5,"very hip ,cool,and funny","i like all the songs on there thier so cool.i went to one of their concerts and it was awesome they got every one so riled up the show was fantastic,so if your thinking about buying a cd of thier's please don't delay.they put a lot of energy into this and deserve credit."
5,A Great Way To Learn And Prepare For PMP Certification,"With so many IT jobs being outsourced, I needed a competitive edge to remain marketable. I decided it was time to go for my PMP certification. I have a variety of study materials. However, I needed a guide to get me started in the right direction, without wasting much time. This guide provides a great overview of all the process areas. If you're truly serious about PMP Certification, then this guide will give you exactly what you need to get started. I highly recommend it."
2,well intentioned but useless,"This is a book by someone who obviously loves corvids but is unequipped for realizing the task she set herself. The ""fabulous"" part of the book deals with old world history in two sentences, spending the rest of the space on folksy retellings of stories from Native American traditions. The ""natural"" part of the history is anecdotal, sentimentalized and inadequate. Other works serve far better for each of this one's stated purposes."
4,Great info on the various types of adoption.,"A great resource for info on all types of adoption (agency, facilitator, international, lawyer etc) A must read for anyone who's considering adopting a child. This book gives you a very real idea of what's involved and the advantages and disadvantages of each type of adoption."
4,I Do Prefer Astronauts!!,"Like Failure, another underrated band that never got the credit they were due. Got caught at the end of the grunge-era and couldn't really find a niche. ""Stars"" was probably their only song that got any recognition (matter of fact, I just heard it in a Cadillac commerical tonight!!!), but I wouldn't even consider that one of the albums best. Nothing super fancy here, just some solid riffs driving sweet tunes...Highlights of the album: ""Little Dipper"", ""The Pod"", ""I'd Like Your Hair Long""Heck, who am I kidding, it's all good."
4,Genius work dedicated to shoe gazers.,"The beauty of music is that it doesn't have to punch you in the face to be moving (see Sigur Ros). Hum's 1995 release ""You'd Prefer An Astronaut"" is, at first listen, quite disappointing to those of us who still haven't learned that patience is a virtue and beauty is found below the surface. Upon further investigation (when I managed to sit down and give the album my full attention), I found that within the monotone vocals, buzzing guitars and perfectly understated drumming was a work that subtly burrows its way into your mind and leaves you better off than it found you."
2,poor vacuum,"This is perhaphs the poorest vacuum I have ever owned. Even on the thinnest pile rugs, this vac. has trouble picking up dirt. The self-propel feature on the rug attachment pulls the vac along like a lawn mower, making maneuverability difficult. The ""low"" setting is not sufficiently low to remove dirt from newer, thin rugs. The step feature to release the rug attachment is difficult to use, requiring many attempts to release. The wood floor attachment is too tall, not fitting under baseboards or the front of kitchen appliances. The hose is so pliable that it always kinks, and the power cord is very short compared to other vacuum's."
2,Electrolux EL6988E Oxygen,"I am very disappointed! I thought I was splurging for the Electrolux because I have always had a great respect for them but this model has a flimsy hose, the carpet piece has little or no suction at the edges (including the front edge), two of the attachment tools are housed in the hose handle and fall off all the time and there is no place to put the bare floor attachment and the handle is very awkward and uncomfortable. I am ready to go back to my old faithful Kenmore. The only good think about it is that it is light weight. Not the Electrolux I have known for most of my life.Electrolux EL6988E Oxygen Canister Vacuum"
2,Not worth the money,"After reading the reviews, I decided to purchase one of these vacuum units. There is a ""C"" clamp that fastens the powerhead to the shaft. Unfortunately, this keeps falling off. Sometimes the vacuum will pick it up and you have to search for it in the debris bag. I did find a website and ordered three more of these clamps but really you should not need to worry about it at all. Vacuum cleaners are meant to be pulled around and they unfortunately run into things. They are not made to be weak and fragile. Electrolux made a huge design error when this clip was made. You will have problems with this little annoying piece of plastic. As for the rest of the vacuum, the suction is above average, cleaning capability is good. The attachments are useful and are very handy. The other downside is the size of the debris bag. It is no bigger than a microwave popcorn bag and fills quickly."
2,Not my best purchase,The plug retractor has broken. The carpet tool didn't work from the beginning. It has 3 levels but the lights did not show which level you were in and then the light just quit. I don't think the beater brush has ever worked. I thought Electrolux would be a good product. I am still using it but without the carpet tool.
2,works well when not broken,"When this vacuum is working it is an excellent performer. But ours has burned out twice in dramatic fashion. The electronics in the handle that control the power head fry themselves by spitting sparks and smoke into the room. The result is a completely scorched, melted and disintegrated electrical connector point when you detach the handle to further investigate. The first time this happened I counted it as a fluke after 12 months of use. Customer service politely sent us a new hose and we were back in business then exactly 12 months later it happened again. One week after the warranty expiration. This time customer service was not too keen to help even after the potential fire hazard. Luckily we bought this from a large chain buying club store who were happy to take the unit back and refund me. It appears the gauge of the electrical connections is not robust enough to handle the current going through the system. Not properly engineered and a fire hazard as well. Beware!"
1,Don't get suckered on this item,I ordered this item under the assumption that it was new. After 53 days of residental use it died. Ran through the troubleshooting items to no avail. Called Eletrolux customer servic and was informed that all electrolux vacuum cleaners bought through Amazon are used and would not qualify for warranty repair. Called Amazon and was informed that their return policy was only for 30 days. So buyer beware!!!
4,Seems great to me,"I just got this vacuum - it's light, easy to move around, and really works. I had an older upright hoover dimension that was ready to die. This EL6988D works so much better, quieter, lighter and easier to move around my home. Seems like a winner, and fit and finish seem good to me. Will report back if issues arise. Pros: Long retractable cord, great carpet cleaning performance, extension telescope handle, quiet. Cons: Tipped over on it's back a couple of times when resting upright and vacuuming."
3,frustrating,"I did a lot of research before purchasing a vacuum. I had reservations about ordering on-line because of the inconvenience of returning the item. This vacuum is just kind-of ok. A part on the handle broke immediately and had to be duct taped together. Would I buy another? No Would I order another appliance on-line? Definately, no."
1,Complete piece of junk,Total plastic. Don't breath on it or it will fall apart. I had mine for a week and the power head jammed. Took it back for full credit and bought something else. This is not an Eletrolux - it's a Eurika. Nothing but junk.
1,The brush-motor broke in less than 2 weeks,"Everything is fine, except that the brush-motor broke down in less than 2 weeks. I just used once and it went down the second time I used it. Wondering why the manufacture could not make a more reliable motor."
2,Not worth it!!!,"The vacuum was good while it worked, but it broke for the first time before the warranty was up. I replaced the part, and it broke again within a couple of months. I took it in for repair and soon after yet another part broke. The repair is expensive. I basically threw about $400 down the drain plus repairs, trashed the vacuum and purchased another one. Repair is not justified by the obvious lack in quality of the vacuum. The Customer service is awful and not willing to admit fault in their product."
2,Good band...terrible lead singer!,"I was looking around for some bands Ive never heard of and I came across Hum - Electra 2000. After reading the reviews it definitly sounded like my kind of music...but boy was I surprised. The band is very good...I like the mix of good guitar work and drums, but the vocals really distract from the songs. If they had a better vocalist I would have to give them 4 stars...Now I know people will say ""You didnt give it enough time""...trust me, I listened to it over and over about 4 or 5 times and It really didnt grow on me. Overall...Im just really disappointed because I now this could be a great band with a different singer. If you would like to hear some better music from this genre...try Tool - Opiate or Alice in Chains - Facelift. They sound similiar...just a lot better!"
5,"I am your guardian, I am the wishfire . . .","To keep this short and sweet- best.album.ever. ""Wishifre"" mixes all the best elements from previous Cruxshadows releases, adds a dash of EBM and brings them all together with all the musical finesse that the Cruxshadows are so rightly famous for.go get it."
1,Dylan - Bob Dylan - Columbia 1973,"Terrible terrible album. The female singers vocals are mixed WAY too high in the mix, and they're on nearly every trackDylan does Joni, Elvis, but really this is pretty wretched dreck.High points: I don't think so. ""Ira Haynes"" is a bore, but its not as bad as the rest of thisNone of these songs was written by Dylan, so maybe he was going for a Self Portrait II (which seems to have become Down in the Groove, another wretched product)But this seems to have been released by Columbia without Dylan's approval, and its long out of printLike Renaldo and Clara (dreadful) and Tarantula (double dreadful) this is one of those Dylan things that its best forgotten aboutOnly Dylan and the Dead is a worse release than this, but at least that has a funky cover!"
5,I literally owe my career to this book!,"I literally owe my career to this book. If there were only one AS/400 sys admin book you could own, this would be the one! Two years ago I was thrown into the fires of AS/400 System administration. This book was the water I needed to put out those fires and become a proactive system administrator. It sits on the corner of my desk and I still reference it all the time. The ""Primer"" explains the situation in simple enough terms that a beginner will become excited about setting up and working with the AS/400. Then it will take you to the next level so that you can become a proactive administrator rather than a reactive one. I have recommend the ""Primer"" to friends that are seasoned administrators and they reference it all the time too. I just can't say enough about this book."
5,Everyone needs one,"This product is so amazing, beautiful, sturdy and looks good in any bathroom style and/or color. If you happen to find 1 don't pass up this. Also the sellers were fast to ship."
3,"Not, bad, but has anyone noticied...","That T-Pain's catchiest song ""N Love Wit a Stripper"" rips off Barry Mannilow's ""Oh Mandy?"" funny.""She poppin she rollin she rollinShe climbin that pole andI'm N Luv with a stripperShe trippin she playin she playinI'm not goin nowhere girl I'm stayingI'm N Luv with a stripper""""Oh Mandy, You came and you gave without takingbut I sent you away, Oh Mandy, girl you kissed me and stoppedme from shaking, and I need you today, Oh Mandy, youcame and gave without taking, oh Mandy, you kissed meand stopped me from shakING, and I need you...""Well, it only works when with set to the music."
4,It was Edited!!!!!!!!!!!!!,It was in great shape when I got it and I recived it really fast. The olny problem I had was the CD was edited and I did not know that. I would have never bought it. That was my bad.
2,Sorry,I'm not even going to waste time reviewing this. T Pain only had two hits. Download those two and be done
5,Great Anti-Hero Movie,"I loved this movie. Michael Douglas is masterful and plays one of the best anti-hero characters since DeNiro's Taxi Driver. If you love dark comedies this movie is for you.Michael Douglas plays a man (with a temper) who becomes overwhelmed with the ""BS"" of the world and finally fights back. He proceeds to go on a rampage and act out against all the things he finds to be wrong in the world.This movie is great and is worth owning in one's DVD collection.Movies I recommend in addition to this one OR movies that, if you liked them, I think you will like this:-Welcome to the Dollhouse (Solondz)-Any Quentin Tarantino-Big Lebowski-Taxi Driver"
3,Nice idea but weak dialogue and stereotypical characters,"Michael Douglas does his best to carry it off, but in the end the corny dialogue and stereotypical characters trip him up."
3,Classic Michael Douglass,I do like the characters he chooses to portray. Movie was good-he was good in it. Troubled. Like a lot of his roles. Ok for a night in.
2,Not a tutorial book or text book at least,"I found this book is hard to follow for a beginner. Before one topic is fully explained, it jump to another, and then the topic will be repeated a few chapters later. I tried a few times to read it from beginning, but each time failed to continue after some pages. Is the XML schema itself too complicated or it's the problem of the book's organization?"
1,"If I could go lower than one star, I would!","First I'll say, in defense of this novel, I am a Prince George's County resident, so my opinion maybe a little bias. With that said....this novel was awful. The characters were one-dimensional and very predictable; the storyline weak and predictable and the writing...well you get the point. The references to our area were sterotypical (and grossly inaccurate)...Really Connie, you didn't have to move to Prince George's County to write this story. Sorry, there is no save here as far as I'm concern, all around bad novel."
2,Lotta Hype...Little Substance,"I am a big Connie Briscoe fan (having read all her other work), but I was hugely disappointed with this one. I found the story line predictable, the characters not well-defined and unbelievable and the whole thing not worthy of Connie's talents or my time.I took it on vacation, read it in 2 days and was forced to find a Sue Grafton book in a public library to wipe its taste from my mouth. Sorry, Connie, but this one didn't do it for me."
4,A book that is very character driven,I found this book to be good except for the ending. I just found it so intriguing that although these people were upper middle class or rich they had some major problems. My favorite character from the book was Jolene. Jolene might have been sneaky and condescending but I felt so sorry for her because in the end she ended up all by herself.
2,Didn't like it at all,"I didn't find these snobs to be worthy of reading at all. Also, why am I constantly reading about the interracial dating nowadays? I guess I'm just old fashioned but I hope people aren't quite this materialistic. I didn't finish the book but I did scan the pages and pretty much came up with the ending."
3,Gone but not forgotten,"This book is required reading for those interested in World War II history, it took me 20 years to get around to it and am glad I did. Written when most of the principles were still alive (Monty, Clark, Bradley), it is less than frank and open. However, it is an interesting compendium of WWII history as told from the Cat Bird's Seat. Ike was not a great general, but he was a hell of a manager of men and logistics. This is a very good book and all folks interested in WWII need to read it."
2,"5 stars for the film, 0 stars for the sound....","The soundtrack on this film is truly horrible... HOWEVER, I did find that by adjusting the balance completely to the right, I was able to hear just the dialogue, without the dreadful, invasive sound effects track getting in the way. The DVD is unwatchable unless you do this!"
1,not very good,Confusing to follow instructions for data entry.Difficult when errors are made... the student has to get back into the previous units and figure out the correction.There is an instructor's disk that can bring the correct data in... the student then can continnue from a specific point.Errors in the student and instructor's text.
3,the good & bad of it,"the book is easy to read and the lesson seem easy to follow. the problem is the floppy disk that accompanies this program.everyone in my class had problems with the disk. i lost a lot of valuable time, i was unable to complete most of the lessons like most of my class mates. for that reason i would not suggest this program."
5,Hydrive,This is a great energy drink. There are no associated jitters with Hydrive. I drink a bottle before my workout so I can push a little harder. It also helps with the afternoon slump. I love this stuff!
4,"Intigue, darkness, happiness and surprise in one book!","In book 8, Feldhake does a good job of keeping the reader guessing. A young white man is living among the poor Black bayou people, unable to remember his name. A young gypsy girl, Lolly, enjoys the wealth and notoriety her tarot card readings are bringing her.....and when she sees W I L L I A M S in the cards, she heads for the little town where Lizzy and Brad live. Nan, in the meantime, is devoted to God and evangelizes with her music. Joy and Lester are awaiting the birth of their first child, and Billy is trying to adjust to being a widower. Serenity, deeply in love with Billy, is fearfully forced to abruptly stop seeing him and only Lolly knows why. After a painful confrontation between good and evil, the town unites until....... This is a powerful book, full of lots of action, intrigue, and more than anything, faith in God!"
5,A life altering book,"I first listened to this book in audio form on a long drive, so heard the entire text in one session. It really was an inspiring experience. I actually listened to it a second time on the return trip. Lewis' gift for verbalizing complex logical and moral issues amazed and inspired me. As one reviewer said, Lewis is the ""ideal persuader for the ... good man who would like to be a Christian but finds his intellect getting in the way."" His discussions are logical, yet human. A masterful book."
4,A good place to start,"There are better books about the theological problem of pain (the biblical book of JOB, Paul Brand's PAIN: THE GIFT NOBODY WANTS, and Philip Yancey's WHERE IS GOD WHEN IT HURTS?, to name three), but Lewis's book is a good place to start. Lewis himself makes it clear in the introduction that this book only addresses the intellectual problem arising from suffering, and as such does not pretend to give advice about living with pain. Lewis offers this by way of observation, that ""when pain is to be borne, a little courage helps more than much knowledge, a little human sympathy more than much courage, and the least tincture of the love of God more than all."" As a catalyst for considering the theological difficulty of resolving the idea of a good God with the pain and suffering in His creation, this book is worth reading."
3,Meh.,"They are nice looking, but they don't have a shape for the foot, and are quite uncomfortable to wear. I'm not sure if I will ever wear these because of that reason. Also, the one size fits all is quite small. I am 5'4"" and weigh 102 lbs and the tights were quite snug."
3,Pretty good debut!,"Pretty good mystery set in 1920's Greenwich Village. Olivia Brown is a poetess whose fiancee was killed in WWI. She inherits a house in the Village, and, along with it, a tenant, Harry, a P.I. One night, she stumbles across a dead body that looks suspiciously like her, and she enlists Harry's help to find out what's going on.Good depiction of flappers, Prohibition, and the Jazz Age. The character development was a bit shallow, and I hope the second book will improve on that. There's a lot of potential here!"
2,It would be better if...,"Olivia wasn't so in love with herself. The character is shallow and boring. I wouldn't mind her if she would shut up about all her lovers. Yeah, got it, men like you...probably because she is sleeping with the entire city. I suppose she is written to be stubborn and relentless but she succeeds at being foolish."
1,ZZZZZZZ,"There should be a thing for no stars on here because that's what this book should get! This book was sooooo boring, i couldn't get past the first 12 pages in one weekend! It's soo descriptive and long and AGONIZING! I wish i could have scraped out my eyeballs to get into honors english instead of having to read it! augh! and the cliff notes thing didn't really work out! anyway write me or IM me at vballchick2003 on aol :"
2,A Generation Lost.,"I've read the Red Bagde of Courage by Stephen Crane and I believe it is a great book geared towards a specific group of peole. It's not for your adverage highschooler. What will they get out of it? For a generation who knows nothing for war and couldn't care in the least bit, it's time to change with the times. What your father and grandfather read in school probably won't have the same effect on you. Grant it, it was well written, however, I thought this book was extremely boring. But, what do you expect from a generation who grew up spoon fed by tv and computers and the everyday visual stimulation experienced could last a person who was part of this time(when the book was set) a lifetime."
2,I didn't understand it and I think it was rather a bad book.,I thought the book was soooo-> boaring it was really hard for me to understand it is for a higher grade level than I am in but my U.S.Cultures teacher made us read it and write a four page report on it. I thought it was the dumbest book I have ever read.
3,Disappointed,"I purchased this movie since I thought the actor pictured was the lead male in this movie. However, he is not in this movie and obviously the studio must have used a still shot from a screen test with this actor. This movie wasn't bad, but wasn't that great either. Just my opinion."
1,Rap at it's lowest level...,"Boy, rap has really hit rock bottom. Trashy lyrics, short skirts (...) what ""hip hop"" has become. Well maybe not just that. But ""Trina"" (who I think is really a drag queen) has brought the black female back about....50 years. (...). Oh sure if I actually bought this CD I would laugh for days just because of sheer amusement, but no, people ACTUALLY bought this because they sincerely ENJOY the music.Oh lord! I guess it's to late to save you from listening to this knee high watered down version of Lil' Kim, but oh well!"
2,not that good,not that hot for sophmore effort she could have found somthing to talk about other than sex and cloths
1,"Trina is wack, but cute","Whoever like this album, is crazy. Trina is beautiful, but is also the wackest female MC in the game. And ""Diamond Princess"" proves this. Her lyrics need serious work, all she ever raps about is money and sex. And when she tries to be serious like on ""U & Me"" she sounds stupid. The only songs I was feeling was ""B R Right"" and ""Told Y'all"" mainly b/c of the beats. But what was she thinking when she recorded ""Kandi"" ""Get This Money"" and ""I Wanna Holla"" and the rest are too worst to even mention. I think she seriously needs help from real females like Lil' Kim, Foxy Brown, and Ms. Jade. I don't even know how she got a record deal."
5,Awsome,"Trina can really spit worthy raps!!! She did a good job on Diamond Princess. Luckily it became platinmum! The best songs have to be the first few: Hustling, Told Y'all - Rick Ross, Rewind That Back - Missy Elliott and Nasty B**ch. These songs were funny. The rest was pretty good. It's a good listen!!!"
1,the Poor Lil Kim,Trina I Love to watch but hearing on the Mic is a No-No.hopefully She will get a Show like Anne Nicole Smith? I enjoy Anne as far as watching but I keep Her on Mute.the same way with Trina.I Like watching Her but Hearing Her is something Bad.She can't Rap or Sing the Music is lackluster to me overall.at best She is a Lil Kim Clone.at worst hurting on the ears.
4,Quit Hatin,"People hate on Trina because they ain't got her body figure or MC skills. Quit hatin and go get a life. Trina ain't weak and obviously she ain't weak because her albums sell more than yall make in a life time. I am just keepin it real. If you don't like Trina, quit lookin at her reviews. But she ain't weak and a majority of her songs go hard. You will be satisfied and B R Right alone is enough to go get the album Diamond Princess (Hot Album)I am just keepin it real. And this is real, Foxy Brown suck. Trina got her every day and all day. Also Jackie-O. She'll beat all these little female MC's but just a few. She is at least ranked in the top 4 of female Mc's. Trina, Lil'Kim, Remy Martin, Da Brat.Just go cop Trina new CD in July and yall find out. Listen to Don't trip. Here new song with Lil' Wayne. That's off Glamourest Life. Also leavin you, heated (dissin Jacki-O) even though Trina and Jacki-O cool now, and many more... Trina is a Hot female MC!!"
4,Coachella,I got this free(promotional) at coachella .. and i was wonderfully suprised that this was so good .. its alittle too trance to be a 5 .. since its kinda cliche at times .. but its actually rather intelligent like juno reactor ..
4,A very good romance novel,"I greatly enjoyed reading this book. The heroine of the story is a young lady named Cordelia Grant. She attends a school in Switzerland where she and her friends meet a handsome stranger in the forest at the exact moment when one of them is supposed to see their future husband. Cordelia is haunted by memories of this stranger that follow her to Colby Abbey Academy for Young Ladies where she becomes a school teacher. The handsome landlord, Jason Verringer, pursues Cordelia, but he has a dark past that keeps Cordelia away.The book's plot is easy to understand and follow. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who likes Victoria Holt or likes a good romance novel."
3,Good for beginning teachers or homeschoolers,"This book offers many science/art projects, but without real science or art depth. These projects would be good for an introduction to science/art, but you would need to do your homework to really make the lessons meaningful."
1,Multiple kinks on first try,"I bought this cable for my BrassCraft 400 since the one that originally came with it broke after 4+ years of use. Since Brasscraft is the manufacturer of Cobra products, I figure this would be a fitting replacement. A couple months after my purchase, the cleanout was backing up so it was my first opportunity to try the new cable. To my disappointment, the cable went no further than 20 feet before I couldn't feed the line any longer. When I pulled out the cable, there were multiple kinks along the cable. This is the same cleanout I've used the previous cable for the past 4 years without fail. When I compared the new cable with the previous one, the new cable appears to be made of a softer material and I could easily create a kink by slightly bending the cable."
5,Great for Homeschooling,"This book is well written, orderly and plenty of practice pages. Great for homeschooling a 6 year old. So many things we have forgotten over the years. This is easy to understand and gives all the basic rules of grammar with plenty of practice. I would recommend it."
3,"Great game, but Sparce",This version of the game come up SHORT. I have to say I have NOT purchased the game in this form but I have played it by another manufacture and love the game. This version comes up SHORT as it only has enough cups and dice for four players but should be for double that. It's great fun with more players so that's why I say it come up SHORT. I love and wanted to get the pirate theme version but won't be buying two games to make one.
2,meh,"just another basic psychology book, nothing special.if you need it for a class, well then get it.but if you need this just for private study, DONT get it lol.get a newer version."
1,not the jack black you're thinking of...,Don't get confused thinking this is Jack Black of Tenacious D and High Fidelity etc. - I'm almost 99% sure it's not. Luckily I didn't buy the album and find that out afterwards. I merely listened to the samples on here. So don't be fooled and waste your money!
4,A Pre-Adolescent Pleaser,"Middle-school aged youngsters, and probably boys especially, will almost certainly enjoy this story of a son's heroic, but very human, efforts to prove his father right about an ecological wrong. Hiaasen writes fluidly, and this tale is engrossing--filled with true-to-life, sometimes gritty, characters. He writes for young people without a hint of condescension. The author's values are the underpinnings of his tales for youngsters, but he never preaches. He teaches also, but without a bit of pedagogy. Our grandsons have enjoyed the Hiaasen books we have sent them; the titles alone have immediately captured their interest."
2,Good info but at too high of a price,"I expected a little more on different kinds of metals and projects, the author basically shows you how he does his particular artwork but not much else. You can learn much more from a video that just a book but since buying this I have found cheaper videos out there."
5,This works wonders if you're feeling a cold coming on.,"I make sure I have a bottle of these Wellness tablets in the cabinet at all times. Sometimes I might feel a sore throat or maybe just some kind of imbalance in my health. If I have any concern that it might be a cold, I pop a couple of these pills for a day and usually the symptoms go away. (I get about one cold a year--sometimes none if I catch it in time.) If I don't catch my cold in time, I find that taking these Wellness tablets speeds up the symptoms and all the stages of the cold. Before I discovered these Wellness tablets, my colds lasted a week to 10 days. When I take these pills at the beginning of my cold I find that the cold goes through the stages in about 3-4 days. For me, that is wonderful. They smell like whiskey, but don't be put off by them. There is no whiskey in them! It's just all the herbs. They work wonders. My husband and I both consider this one of our favorite and essential natural remedies. Great product!"
5,It works,"I've never really taken nutritional supplements but last year when I was suffering from a cold, I was introduced to the Wellness Formula and after taking it for two days, I recovered. I thought it was a fluke so the next time I had symptoms of a cold coming on, I bought it and tried it again and it worked. Now, whenever I have symptoms of getting ill, I take it prophylactically and I haven't suffered from a cold yet. I've told others about it and they state the same. I'm not sure what's in this stuff and how it works, but it works."
5,HEAD THE FLUE OFF AT THE PASS,"THE MOMENT I START TO FEEL LIKE I AM COMING DOWN WITH THE FLUE OR A COLD (ITCHY THROAT, HEADACHE, MALAISE, ETC.) I START TAKING THE WELLNESS FORMULA BY SOURCE NATURALS. IT WORKS EVERY TIME. I START TAKING 2 TABLETS EVERY 4 HOURS, AND USUALLY I NEVER GET A FULL BLOWN CASE OF THE FLUE. MY FRIENDS, WHO DON'T TAKE WELLNESSS, WILL SUFFER FOR 4-6 DAYS WITH SYMTOMS, WHILE I AM OVER IT IN A DAY OR TWO! I'VE BEEN USING THIS PRODUCT SINCE THE MID EIGHTIES,TRY IT AND SEE FOR YOURSELF.KATE N., MEDFORND, OREGON"
4,Great Cure-All Product,"I dealt with a cold for weeks and weeks on end and was sleeping, drinking fluids, etc. Nothing would stop it. I ordered this product after a suggestion from a friend and wala-gone. It's a natural way to end sickness and with all the nutrients, it'll help you knock out your sickness in no time."
4,beware,"This is a good product but beware if you have allergies. I took two doses of 3 pills each, The first dose no reaction,but upon the second i had tightness in my chest and difficult breathing.There are mamy herbals in this product and evidently i am allergic to one of them.I would caution use if you have allergies or try another product all together. Good luck"
1,I have a cold.,"I bougth these with some expectations to dodge a cold. My two kids need a healthy mom to care for them when they are sick. However, I'm sick with a cold now and had another one last week. I take the recommended dose and I'm a healthy eater. SO? I guess my colds were too hard for this to work.They also repeat on me something awful for a hour after taking them. Burping this is not pleasant. I will stick to tylenol and get back to work."
2,Not as thick as I hoped,"I have 2 tiny dogs and I often have to clean the floor where their spot has spilled onto to the floor bc these are so thin. These stated that they were highly absorbent but my dogs only weigh 5 lbs and these dont work. There are companies who do sell thick pads where the spot does not spread, it's just hard to know who is telling the truth until you get them home. I would say pass on these."
1,FLIMSY AND CHEAP!!!!,"I just received the pads, but they are no where near the same quality of my previous orders! I received 2 boxes containing 15 packages of 10 flimsy underpads each box. The only thing that is remotely similar to my last order is the size of the pad....nothing else. I should have been told this horrible product was substitued for the product I received in the past....the old bait and switch con...very bad!!! Buyer beware!They are not worth the money I paid for them!!!!!!!!!"
4,"Good, not great.","Closer to three stars than to five, still, I'd say that this book (made up of two related novellas, one featuring Kirk & the Enterprise, one featuring the cast of DS9, and an intoduction featuring Archer & the ""Enterpise"" cast) is enough better than average to merit four stars. The plots seem to be a bit formulaic, but not too bad for all of that, and the characters are handled reasonably well, especially those minor characters that we only saw as expendable extras in the episodes that they originally appeared in. The character of Commodore Decker, in particular, seemed quite true to what we saw in ""The Doomsday Machine""."
1,Split Personality - Horrible and Hurts my ears,This is the worst cd i've ever bought. I couldn't believe how bad it was when i listened to it for the first time. The only hot song on here is with RKelly which got played out 12months ago. The next best song is only good cuz it has a Tupac beat. The rest of Swizz Beatz's beats are garbage!!!! I use my Cassidy cd to pick up my dog's droppings!
3,not great but better than a lot of other new stuff,"cassidy is not close to as bad as other new horrible rappers like j-kwon or murphy lee. this cd's not amazing, but the production's pretty good and cassidy's not bad. two AMAZING songs are ""the problem"" and ""get no better"". download those if u don't get the whole cd"
2,horrible cd,"cd doesnt show what cassidy can really do!!! cds like this prove to show that good battle emcees do not always translate to making a good album...cassidy's first release isn't horrible, there are a couple good tracks like ""make you scream"", ""get no better"", and the single ""hotel"" (didnt like it at first but it grew on to me)...but with all the hype surrounding this one, it greatly dissapoints...i think the jin album will flop as well...JIN please PROVE ME WRONG!!!"
4,The New Cassidy Album,"I only gave this album 4 stars because of how a few tracks sounded more like pop, not hip hop. But luckly, there is some really good songs on it. The best songs are Can I Talk To Ya, The Problem and Lipstick. I think Cassidy is good for some one who is new to tha game."
1,Cassidy Thinks He`s All That.,This album should get zero stars because he sucks. I don`t like his music epecially Hotel and Get No Better. And his other album that is coming out I`m A Hustler. He ain`t no hustler he`s just garbage. If you want to hear good songs listen to J-Kwon. Don`t buy Spit Personality and I`m A Hustler.
1,dangerous,"I was very angry and disappointed in this play gym. It collapsed twice on my baby within the first two weeks we had it. Once the base mat folded around my baby causing a suffocation hazard. I won't use it again and at $60 it is a pretty expensive piece of trash. The company has been pretty unresponsive in rectifying the problem as well. I expected much more from the ""Baby Einstein"" brand."
5,its great..,"lights, music, and toys, ever babys dream ;) i give this a 5 star rating because it even entertains my 2 month old..she will lay on it for hours and stay entertained kicking and grabing at the toys, and watching the star with the bright flashing light which go along with the music..."
5,Great first toy,This is a great gym. Baby loves the music and dangling toys. Great for development as well. This toy actually helped my daughter progress quickly through developmental stages. Love it!
5,A fun play mat for my little man,"My baby boy has never been into toys that dangle and rattle, so it has been tricky finding him things that would keep him interested to encourage exploration and learning. So when I got the Baby Einstein Play Gym from a friend, I was skeptical. But my baby boy loved it the first time I laid him on it. He especially liked the little star that displays lights as it plays music. I think that's the biggest thing that kept him really focused on this toy for a while. As for the duck, the bird, the other stuff hanging on this play mat, he did use them as punching bags which is pretty cute. Now that my boy lays on his tummy more and more, he's beginning to explore the images on the mat with gusto. I like this product and highly recommend it!"
5,best thing I purchased,"I love this activity center and my son does too. He plays on this mat as much as he wants to. The toys can be rotated and moved around on the various links, the musical star captivates him, the picture frame can be changed out with family photos or flash cards, and he loves to read the book during tummy time. I have never really bothered with the green pillow, but nevertheless this is one of my favorite purchases I have made for my baby."
4,Not Quite What We Hoped For,"I'm sure this is a fine product. Unfortunately, our little one didn't really have any interest in it. She really liked the star though. She would giggle at it & smile, but would get tired of it after a few minutes. I guess its just a matter of taste. I would recommend this to others though. Just because my baby didn't have much interest in it, doesn't mean other babies won't."
4,Great baby gym,"Our 2 month old daughter loves this gym! She has been using it since she was about 2 weeks old. She can't keep her eyes off the star at the top of the gym, even when it is not playing. She is able to kick the toys that hang off the links to make it play very pleasant music. It seems that the motion sensor has become less sensitive over time, which is very disappointing. She is able to play with the motion sensor and the toys for up to 10 minutes, which for a 2 month old seems like an eternity. It give me time to do a quick chore around the house.The mirror on the gym is not the best but it serves its purpose. I like the little pillow that comes with it too, for tummy time and to prop her head so she can see better when laying on the mat.Overall, I strongly recommend this toy! It is well worth the money!"
2,Not worth the price and it overstimulates babies,"I am a big fan of the ""Baby Einstein"" products and thought I couldn't go wrong with this one. Unfortunately, it overstimulated my daughter. I think it was all the bright colors and the little star that lights up and plays music hangs down too low. My daughter would scream after about 2 minutes when laid down on this play gym. She never used it longer than 5 minutes. Now that she is 5 months old, she does sit up on the mat and chew on the star for short periods and the toys detach and we have got some use out of those. But overall, I would not recommend it."
5,Best Toy to Register For,"We started using this playgym for our daughter when she was just three weeks old; it was her first toy! She loved looking at the star that lights up and plays music. Then around two months old, she started batting at the dangling toys. At three and a half months, she realized that if she shakes the bars by kicking them, SHE can make the music come on. And at four months, she started rolling over on this mat. It has been so much fun seeing her laugh and smile and hit all of these milestones while on the Baby Einstein mat! And now at six months, she still uses it everyday. I would highly recommend this mat to any new parent to purchase or put on your registry! It's safe, educational, and fun for your child. What more could you ask for?"
4,My baby loves this gym,He especially loves the musical light up star. I have started taking the star with us when we go out. I just attach it to his carrier seat.The only complaint I have about this gym is that its not very stimulating for tummy time. Its also not that big. My baby is 11 weeks and almost too big for the mat now.
5,Baby loves this,My baby has adored this from day one. We have had it for several months now and she has not tired of it yet. Her favorite part is the star. She just lights up! It's great for travel as well. Now she is almost 5 mos and although she hasn't out grown the toys we do have to put it on a larger blanket because she will roll right off it at times.
5,THEE BEST TOY FOR OUR BABY,"$60 sounded like a lot to me but it's THEE BEST toy for a newborn. Love it, love it, love it - it's a must!"
3,Not interested,"My little girl is two months old and she has had this since birth. She, at best, tolerates it at times. She really doesn't seem to be very excited about it at all. I hope that it changes."
5,My son can't get enough!!!,"He absolutely loves this playmat. He can spend 20 minutes there easily at one time! He smiles, talks to the star and blinking lights and kicks the side bars like crazy to make the music play. A great toy!"
3,"Cute, but not what I really needed","I got this for tummy time. But the baby has to be on his back to play with the toys arranged as they are in the picture. So it's pretty much used as a blanket with a bunch of toys on it. The many hooks are useful as the toys can be attached to hooks on the corners of he mat and not just on the bars above.For what it is, I think it's a fine product. But if you need tummy time for your little one, I really don't see how this is very useful. But I have to give it credit for the fun colors/design and the variety of toys. The musical star is adorable and my son's favorite feature. He's 5 months old now and I think he'll be playing with this for quite a while yet."
1,Ummm...yeah.,"""Your wife might take a dump on the delivery table""...is just one of the great sentences in this horrible book. Oh yeah...and if the doctor cuts her, don't worry, this book tells her just to get a ""happy husband stitch"". Nevermind that lovemaking will be incredibly painful for her....!! Oh, unless you have a c-section, in which case it will just be your hormones to deal with.What a terrible book."
2,Daddy not too happy with this book,"I bought this one for my husband as something to keep him amused and involved, and he actually got really frustrated reading it. He said it was no help to him, and just focused on the negative parts of a beautiful thing. I don't recommend it."
1,VERY DANGEROUS TOY!!!!!!!! My daughter got hurt!,"We were given this toy as a gift, and at first I was very excited about all the different things it is able to do...until my daughter got hurt! The pig on this toy sits on a swing and swings back and forth. My daughter was playing with it and started to cry! Her fingers got stuck where the pig swings. I honestly figured it was just a fluke, but decided to hold off on letting her play with it until she was a bit older. At 13 months I brought the toy back out and let her play with it again. A few days later her hand got so stuck where the pig swings and I couldn't get it out!!! She was hysterical, and it took quite a bit of wiggling to get her little hand free. Her fingers where very red and she cried and cried! I am so lucky it wasn't a serious injury. PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS TOY! It is now in the trash, where it belongs!"
