3,THE FULL SCREEN EDITION,The disc is loaded with commentary extras and a featurette as well. Worth it for those even if the film is not all that great
4,Murder Where The Sun Never Sets,"I should say that the fact that the sun doesn't set for months becomes a major theme in the film, coupled with the question of just what is the behavior that a good cop will expect of him-or herself. Al Pacino gives a bravura performance as the cop who suffers from insomnia due to the sun and whose actions in the past and present lead him to question his self-conception as a good cop. He is ably abetted by Swank and Williams, with the supporting roles being filled well. There is some action, some talk, some scenery, and no sleep. All in all, an above average effort to portray The Detective and The Criminal. Good watching."
3,To predictable.,"Typical film for this suspense mystery genre. Nothing special here except for an outstanding preformance by Robin Williams. Not a complete waste of time. It's a great flick to watch on a rainy day, just don't expect anything different. There's nothing new under the sun, therefore it's all been done before. I'd just like to see it executed originally for a change."
3,i was dissapointed,"I expected this to be really good, but the potentially excellent film by Christopher Nolan was really hurt by the attitude of Al Pacino as a cop in Alaska. In his past few movies, he tries too hard to be young and savvy when he just needs to accept that he is aging. He tries to be cool in this and he is just retarded. Hilary Swank didn't do anything at all to make this movie any better. Robin Williams is the only bright spot in this movie. He is the reason for me giving this three stars. He can play a pretty good villain."
3,Good but not Great,"Al Pacino does and excellent acting job in this movie. It is also a well written piece about character and ""choices"". It just gets a little lost towards the end and not as suspenseful as it should be. (A near car accident is scarier than the confrontation with the killer etc)The biggest problem is the casting or maybe the interpretation of the role by Robin Williams. He is so likeable that it's almost like Mr. Rogers the killer. It does not work and ultimately makes this a film that doesn't work. There is no menace to him - someone like Kevin Spacey would have been much better. (altho no one has ever really beaten Anthony Perkins' incredible acting job in Psycho as a likeable killer)Rent or buy this because it is much better than the ""paint by numbers"" suspense movies we usually get. You know the ""Killer goes after the investigators wife and kids"" etc plot. It was actually written about choices of loyalty, Honesty and what matters the most. (Do ends justify means etc)"
2,Disapointed,"I was disapointed, I thought it could have ben alot better. Both actors were great but Robins charecter was just to nice."
4,Can't fall asleep to this movie,"I don't know anyone who can fall asleep to this fantastic film. Al Pacino, one of the most well known actors stars in Insomnia with Robin Williams and Hilary Swank. Takes place in Alaska, a writer, Walter Finch (Robin Williams) murders a young girl. Detective Dormer (Al Pacino) who killed a fellow detective, who is sleep-deprived tracks Finch down as well as Hilary Swank tracks down Dormer. This dvd has many bonus features. A fantastic movie. From the director of Memento, Christopher Nolan."
3,"Solid Performer, BUT. . .","I couldn't agree more with the first reviewer regarding the design flaws, but I believe in lower grades for such wanton stupidity. The owners' manual rightly harps on the importance of checking the oil and of periodically changing the oil. However, given the placement of the dipstick and the drain plug, they may as well have told us to check the cylinder valves (that would perhaps be easier). To avoid spilling oil on your garage floor or driveway when you change the oil, you almost have to remove the engine. Perhaps the designer could pay me a visit and demonstrate how it works, and wipe up the inevitable oil spills with his shirt.There. . . I feel better now. :-)"
1,If you want to sleep ...Buy it,"If you have to go to bed but you can't sleep, this is the right sleeping pill. The actors are bad and they certainly watched too much Scorcese movies, The bloke who's playing John Gotti is like a poor copy of De Niro playing the mafiosi ! This movie is full of claptrap, useless stuff and during more than two hours. If Gotti was a bad guy, how can he leave this stupidity about his life ? The main actor is walking like a clown. It's really [crud] and disgrace the John Gotti's memory."
4,I loved the movie,"I think this was a sleeper, Anthony Quinn should have gotten a supporting actor award for this!! I haved owned it for 3 months and I would say I watched it 10 times. Worth the price"
1,FAKE Bumble and Bumble Creme de coco!,"I have purchased this product from salons and have been extremely happy with Bumble and Bumble. I thought I would purchase from Amazon to save myself a couple $$. This was a BAD idea because when I used the conditioner for the first time, my hair felt as if it had been STRIPPED and and I could barely run my fingers through my hair! NOT SOFT AT ALL. I decided to try conditioning 2 times in a row but this still gave me the same result. I have used this new bottle for about 2 weeks in hopes that my hair would soften up..but no luck.I am very disheartened because I bought the big pump bottle and I dont even want to use it. The only thing I use it for is to SHAVE MY LEGS!! This product is FAKE and was a huge waste of money. I am never buying B&B; online ever again."
1,Beware: suspiciously inconsistent texture,"Beware in purchasing this item. The viscosity and texture of the product is inconsistent with Bumble and Bumble's typical high quality shampoos/conditioners. My hair did not respond the way it usually does to B&B (it was more like the effect of using a cheap hotel hair product). Although the fragrance seemed 100% spot-on, I still returned the product based on my suspicion that it's a fake."
2,BUMBLE TAKES A TUMBLE IN MY ESTIMATION,"While Bumble and Bumble used to be one of my favorite lines of hair care products, this conditioner (and I might add shampoo by the same name) was a real disappointment.Using it left no softening or conditioning effect and there wasn't even a pleasant scent. Don't know where Bumble fumbled but they certainly fouled up on this one. I'm saving my $$$$$ for Lush and Frederic Fekkai!"
4,Heavy item,"I was already familiar with the product line because I have the hand duster, which is terrific for dusting in the house. I purchased this item for dusting our cars and for reaching the corners of our ceilings in the house. This duster is fairly heavy, and it appears that if I use it to dust in the corners of house, I'm going to get a workout, because the item is heavy. Men should find this no problem. There is a terrific amount of dusting capacity for use on your car, however. Amazon has run this item as low as $15 with super saver shipping."
5,Clean Car in 5 minutes,"I just bought a new white convertible and this product is the greatest for quickly removing dust and light dirt. I am using it daily as it is so easy and quick. Car is spotless after 3 weeks of heavy driving, and I haven't needed to use my free car wash from the dealer!"
2,I was disappointed,The old book came in as promised but I was not happy with its contents and did not help much.
2,Does not stand on its own as a self-teaching method.,"Play Piano Today! - Level 1 (The Ultimate Self-Teaching Method), comes with a book and audio CD. The book does a fair job of showing some of the basics, but it could have been a lot better. Right off the bat they start giving you musical pieces to play, but they don't tell you how to do it. This might be ok, if you knew how to play years ago and wanted a refresher. But if you have never played the piano before, this book will not show you how to do it. Likewise, the CD starts right out of the gate telling you to play things, but doesn't first tell you how to do it. Overall, I would call this product far from the Ultimate Self-Teaching Method, or a complete guide to the basics, which is how they bill themselves."
4,Great book!,"I have a musical background from Middle School through my Freshman Year of college and thought I could pick up the piano once before...that was before this book I tried a different one...and THIS book is wonderful! The pace is great! There are a few songs that are cheesy (even for how much beginning knowledge it has) thus I only give it 4 stars instead of 5...I have the DVD as well and find that it's sort of helpful...just because it gives the illusion of being taught...in other words, with the DVD it's good to hear things like, ""Play slowly first"" and ""This will take awhile."" That was reassuring."
4,So Good!,These are fantastic mixed with fresh berries and dollop of fresh whipped whipping cream. They kinda taste like medicine when you eat them alone.
5,"The Love Boat Season Two, Vol. 1",Great Classic Show that returned me to my young adulthood when shows were calmer and problems were farther away. Great escapism.
4,what can I say that hasnt already been said,"well, most reviewers were pretty right on with this one.. I have found that the more rescent Allen films were more for the fans of Allen then a general Populace, this however i feel most everyone will Like. Its no Annie Hall, or other classic Allen flicks, But it is by far, in my opinion, his best and wittiest film in quite some time... well worth the own."
3,Fading Charm,"Hmmm, I'm not so sure I agree with the Amazon reviewer that Woody Allen 'good-naturedly bites the hand that feeds him'. While the subject of the movie is indeed the film industry, Hollywood Ending is no more a satire of that system than America's Sweethearts was. Both seemed to promise more than they delivered, and neither had the sardonic bite of Blake Edward's scathing SOB. Allen can't or won't muster up that anger, and so Hollywood Ending ends up being nothing more than another vehicle for Allen to display and parody his own neuroses. Granted, there are some very funny lines, but mostly Allen seems pretty self-satisfied at his own cleverness--never more literally than when one character compares directing a film to masturbation. I'm reminded of the Saturday Night Live skits of the Woody Allen fan club in many ways--once you're past the concept, the charm of seeing a Woody Allen caricature fails rather quickly."
2,Still looking for an ending,"Though this movie had a classic Woody Allen appeal, with all the verbal jaunts and crazy circles of comedy, I think Woody Allen may be coming to the end of his movie making career.Despite decent performances from the cast, Woody plays the role of a dirtector (go figure) who loses his sight, and directs the movie blind with the help of three freinds who really know nothing about film.Woody's portrayl of a blind person may be exaggerated to the nth degree, but I think it was appropriate of a person who desperatley needs his sight back, and is lost without his most important sense.The ending of the movie is horrid, which may be why the movie's title is so. It is too perfect, too fast. That, or they just ran out of time and threw something together, and then added the title.Wait for the video. In fact, wiat until you can download it instead."
2,IMAX SPACE STATION 3D,"Viewed on Sony kdl60NX810 led 3dFirst rent b4 you buy. The 3D didn't live up to its expectation, i.e., lacking in oomph! Watchable, fairly educational. Guess i expected a lot more from the blu ray: by being on the space station, i expected to see out from there and what the need for being out there is all about. The space walk is good,shots of half earth could have been better (like full earth), nothing of the moon in any of its phases, nothing of the stars or other planets. A lot of concentration of the people and a bit of their training. 3D is meant to be experienced and entertained (in that order), not waiting expectantly only to be disheartened.Not very impressive to own at the 3D price. 2D will suffice."
3,NOT 3D,This is not 3D but is a good Blu-Ray movie and can be watched in 2D to 3D conversion. It is OK but would not recommend it for a 3D movie to watch.
4,Very interesting 3D movie,"This 3D move was very enjoyable. It has great 3D affects and really shows you the Space Station like you've never seen it. Unfortunately we watched this after seeing another very similarly themed 3D movie that was better than this one. That is the only reason for my lower rating. If I had never seen the other title, I would have been impressed by this one. Still worth the watch, but I would get the best deal you can on it."
4,IMAX,"It was OK. Bought to see it on my new 60"" DLP TV.My main critique on this DVD was the lack of ability to select chapters and skip the boring parts."
3,Interesting but needs more space,This is a good movie if you want to watch astronauts preparing for space travel.Very little footage of space in 3D that is outside of the space station.But it is overall an interesting movie with a few stunning scenes
5,Salival- A great release from Tool,"While most box sets do have maybe all of the artist's music or alot of it on it, and a full book of discovery or something, tool does not have all their songs on this box set, they have 5 songs on this and 3 unlyrical songs in which they only play wierd sounds or call up a minicipul court autmated answering machine. The track list includes Thirdeye (live), Part Of Me (live), and Pushit (live), You Lied (Peach Cover Live), No Quarter (Led Zeplin Cover), and the end Of LAMC (or Maynard's Dick) the *bonus* on the set in which it was from the very early days. This box set is for a really big Tool fan, not the average listener. This box set is more of a bonus to big Tool fans because it has hard to find songs and all the Tool videos. I love this box set, I rate this Box Set a 5 along with Aenima and the rest. This is definitly an awesome Tool release."
2,not all it's cracked up to be......and i love tool!!,"this cd is disapointing. first of all, all that's on the dvd-vhs are videos fans probably tapped off mtv. nothing new . secondly, the cd, it's got a few nice live moments. nothing that spectacular , considering what you payfor it. i really wanted to like this . i just can't . content vs. cost just doesn't add up.i love tool, and no offense to the band or fans , but you should save your money. GO GET THE NEW LATERALUS CD FROM TOOL. IT'S THE REAL DEAL."
3,It's alright,"I am a Tool + APC fanYes, I agree this board has become a chatsite, but no one is lame enough to check back to see if they got an answer. Decent CD, Agreed DVD is OK."
2,Not what i expected.,this dvd has only 4 videos. it's better to let ur mind wonder and try to imagine what the videos are like. Because when u watch them it's just a HUGE HHHHUUUUGGGGEEEEE disappointment.
1,I'M DUM AS DIRT,This cd and dVd is good for fan who like to rOck. tools makeing there best rock in years. i bang my head to tools awsome rock. go out and git this cd and dvd. do not bye the vhs becase vhs bites and dvd is like a cd but only its on the tellevision!! and you beter bye an extra one to keep in its pakage becase you can sell it on ebay for like a million dollars somday. tool good...what more are YOU wating for???
4,It's not LAME,The final song on this CD is not titled LAME it is titled L.A.M.C. That is a C on the end.
1,Rip off,"I'm sorry, but I just can't agree with all these positive reviews for this book. All it is is a $30 listing of pre-fab manufacturers in all the various states. What good does that do? You're only going to build in the state you live in and there is such scant information about the manufacturers in each state that I just don't see how this is so valuable. I rarely write a bad review, but I returned this book because I didn't feel it was worth the money at all."
3,"Love it, but doesn't last as long as I would like","This slide is great, although like another reviewer stated my husband had to devise a way to stop the dragon head from flopping down and hitting the kids. The major downside is that after having it up for a year and a half, the Florida sun had weakened it so much that it is tore and now we need to replace it."
3,herbie,don't remember getting it but it was around Christmas and I ordered a lot of movies. So sorry for he confirmation.
5,The Jim Douglaus Special wins again!,"How can you go wrong, its Herbie (we'll forget about the made for TV movie, although Horace was cool). Any VW guy, lady or child will love this movie. My one and a half year old son sat through the whole thing. I think it hits the target, it brings Herbie back to his roots and at the same time he gets an all new generation to love him."
2,So subtle you barely notice it,"I used as directed and barely noticed a shimmer. I applied more than I needed to to see a difference. It lasts all of a few minutes. This product is a great idea, but perhaps they need to work on their formula more."
3,slippery as an eel,This knife is very beautiful art but completely useless and dangerously clumsy for anything else. Too slippery. Enough said. I gave it away.
5,Love this stuff!,"Aside from the fact that it kinda reminds me of bubble gum when I put it in the tank (I have no idea why it smells like that to me), this product does what it needs to do - keeps the odor of our waste tank to a minimum. We combine these with Walex BIO-11530 Bio-Pak Natural Holding Tank Deodorizer and Waste Digester to manage the odor with these, and digest the waste products with the other. Combined they allow you to empty your tank less often and take longer off-grid trips without being revolted when you get back to a dumping station."
2,Didn't Buy the Storyline.,"There were far too many situations in this film that were simply ridiculous. First, I didn't buy the idea of a wife openly flirting with a 15-year-old without her husband having a clue. Is he an idiot, blind, or so trusting that he is incapable of seeing what's in front of him? And what about the wife? Where was the chemistry between her and the boy? I didnt 'see it. And the trip to Dsneyworld (which other reviewers describe in great detail below, so I won't) was absurd. Why would the wife or the 15-year-old, who are both feeling quite guilty, go to Disneyworld at the insistence of the husband, especially when the discomfort between the three is so thick you could cut it with a knife? I don't think the writer/director of this film did a good job of constructing a believable story. The actors were good, but capable of salvaging this silly story only to a limited degree. Not at all recommended."
1,Rubbish,"This is one of the worst films I ever saw. If it has a story line, it seems to be that human beings are always worthless and untrustworthy. It's not surprising to me that it came and went without causing a single cultural ripple."
4,Need help reconciling omniscience and free will?,"Dr. Rogers text is a pleasureable philosophical read (in a fallen where philosophical texts are usually rather painful to read, as opposed to heaven where they'll most certainly be a joy!).She does a very good job of presenting the classical western opinion (or opinions, in some cases), on many different matters, and is certainly open to criticism on all angles, though selecting the one she believes best solves the problems at hand.Occasionally Rogers seems to get fuzzy on Aquinas' theology, or assume that He and Anselm are on the same page when it's pretty evident that they're not, but it's a minor fault that doesn't detract from the actual philosophy at hand - though it may cause some confusion on what Aquinas did and didn't teach.Overall, however, a good read well worth the time and money. Impress your friends at your next party by buying this book. :p"
5,Michelle Tumes,"Michelle Tume's Cd, ""Center of My Universe,"" is a very nice, calming, and sweet cd to listen to. It is also something one can fall asleep to too.... Oh, and my favorite track on the cd is, ""Lovely."" I find it very nice. Well, I enjoyed this cd, I hope you do/will too.... :)"
4,The Path of Prayer,The book arrived in good condition and in a timely manner. I've not read the book yet but my husband is reading it now. He said it was a good book.
5,killer moves,"this movie rocks, not just skiing but also have the squirl suit skydiving. Crazy stuff."
5,Excellent presentation and accompanying text.,"I have seen this book at the publisher's and it is outstanding. The photographs are exceptional and the descriptions well composed and pertinent. You have, however, left out the name of the CO-AUTHOR, Mary Miley Theobald. I hope you will correct this as both professionals worked long and hard to assemble the edition."
4,A Little Legal Help Never Hurt Anyone,"As a fervent JUDGE JUDY viewer I have come to learn the importance of knowing the law. The book covers just about everything a layman like myself would need to know in the most common situations. It talks about Wills and Inheritance laws, driving infractions, neighborhood laws, basic contracts, Banking/Money situations, etc. It is written in a straightforward style which is easy to understand. This book is organized into succinct chapters with bold headings so it is easy to find exactly what you are looking for. I'm sure this book will come in very handy through the years, especially since my father is nearing 90-years-old, and there will be lots of legal issues to consider once he passes. Nolo's Encyclopedia of Everyday Law answers all the questions that one might have for almost every legal situation."
1,Buyer Beware!!,"I have just received this CD from Amazon and have found that, even though the names of the bands are all the same, the songs are NOT the original recordings - they are re-makes. On the back of the CD jacket, in colored writing that partially blends in with the background color, in text so small that neither my wife nor I could read it without a magnifying glass, positioned at the very bottom on the back where you would normally only find manufacturing and copyright information, is the message:""New Stereo Recordings"".The next CD in this series, 1971, has the same problem but a different disclaimer (again, printed in the same obscure manner as this one) that is worded a little more honestly. It says,""This album contains tracks that may be re-recorded by the original artist. Featured groups may not include all the original members"".Buyer beware."
5,best one,i've read up to the mummy so far and this is still the best one written it's probably the funniest ones and the hardest one to find out who the wolf man is. the gang goes up to the boondocks to hunt down the wolf man this book makes fun of the hat the most out of the ones i've read so far and has a lot more complexity than dracula.
1,"A stressful ""relaxation"" tape","While I had problems with the yoga portion of this tape (too short, required props), those wouldn't bother everyone. For me, the real issue was that the guided relaxation is actually stressful -- the narrator speaks quickly, warning about all the things that we *shouldn't* think about (finances, problems at work, marital issues, etc.). It actually made me tense! Finally, I thought that the health/meal planning advice was absurdly basic: eat organic, eat whole grains, avoid alcohol and coffee. In short, I am selling this to my used book store and looking for another tape."
4,Smooth tasting mousse,This was very good and it was smoothe and good to the taste It was easy to mix and it only took about six minutes.
4,a family tragedy,"All in all, the book is quite interesting. We give the story four stars, because we liked especially the end of it. It was unexpected, you never thought it was going to end like this. This story includes only a few persons, but every single men is important in a way. The tension increases more and more from the beginning to the end. It is thrilling . The plot is directly and clearly, and the text easely. The American English, used in this book, is not this difficult to understand. Through the whole book there is a red line and almost every dialogue is important for the plot ahead. Every word that is said has its own importance. Family tragedies are in the centre of it, and you cannot always see behind the faces of the persons."
4,Very good Ameican tragedy,we must say that this is a really nice book to read. At the beginning the story was a bit boring. Perhaps it was a bit to difficult to understand the context. They made jokes and that gave you a funny impression of the story. But suddenly everything changed. You see how the harmony in the family is destroyed by remembering of the crime the father had done.
4,Tipo de Referencia,Por favor de ser un poco mas detallado en el tipo de referencia de la Santa Biblia Edicion de Lujo.Ud. no especifica si tiene indice o no O que color es
2,Missing rudimentary info - basic concepts/definitions are missing,I have no background to palm reading and was looking for something to give me a background. This one has gaps in some fundamental definitions of understanding the concepts of palm reading. Not one I'd recommend.
1,Doesn't fit A-5 w/ E-Grip,"Do not purchase this item if you have the Tippmann A-5 with an E-Grip. It is not combatible. It will fit on the E-Grip, but it doesn't go down low enough to use as a double trigger defeating the purpose of having a double trigger!"
2,SUCKS,In order to shoot you have to pull this trigger allll the way back and it is not smooth. i recomend the stock trigger.
4,same pattern,"Ayu has another remix album (tradition) that is all acoustic. This time she adds one more instrumental song, compared to Ayu-Mi-x II, the songs are shorter this time, because there are fewer lyrics. I wish she added Audience to this album, sure it might not be the best song to make acoustic, but the remix album needs it. She added ever free, which is a non-album track. It is the last song of the vogue single. Overall I wasn't as pleased as ayu-mi-x II, but non-the-less it is still a good buy."
1,"Interesting subject, if you can decode the writing style","I read about one third of this book before giving up. The subject is very interesting, but the writing style is complex, confused and hard to follow. The author uses rare words for their own sake not for clarity. The sentence construction is obtuse and unclear. He seems to be trying to impress as an intellectual, but he fails to present a clear picture of what happened and when. Michael Burleigh badly needs to meet Rudolf Flesch."
3,Where was the editor?,"Shame on the editor of this book. The writing style is so thick and unwieldy as to make it almost incomprehensible. I haven't seen prose this ""purple"" since my last reading of Edgar Allen Poe.Bulwer-Lytton, move over...So, while the information content is good, there are other more readable books that cover the same territory. Read one of them instead."
1,Save your money,"I am very interested in developing an understanding of how and why the Nazis were able to take over Germany. With a sub-title of ""A New History"" I was looking forward to learning something ""new"" that I haven't learned from the first 100 books I've read on the subject. There was nothing ""new"" here and what is written and the writers style qualifies this book as one of the five worst books I have read on the subject. It is an extremely hard read since he uses compound sentences that string out for four or five lines. It requires very slow reading to get the point being made that often turns out to be his opinion, not a fact. Looks like the editor was out to lunch. Save your money and don't be fooled in buying this one!"
3,"Kerastase Nutritive Bain Satin 2 is good, but expected better","Let me start by saying that this is probably the best shampoo I have ever used. I have been using daily for about a month. For the price I expected more. I'm going to try another shampoo in the Kerastase line next (I'm impressed with this line!). I need something more hydrating and repairing for my damaged, fine hair. I pair it with the masquintense and get wonderful results, but after the shampoo I feel like my hair is not as good as it could be and really rely on the conditioner to achieve the results I want. You don't need much of this super concentrated shampoo. The scent is nice. My hair is in the best condition it has been in years (I heat style daily, highlight regularly, and wash daily). I think this is a wonderful shampoo but I'm looking for something more specific to my needs."
4,"The Soundtrack is a winner, but not as good as music sntrk","This review's coming from a diehard NIGHTMARE fan. I've never heard this soundtrack, but as I read the track listings, I can recall each scene from the movie. The best thing to come from this movie is the music soundtrack, which is - as far as I know - out of print. With songs like Love Kills (Vinnie Vincent), Back to the Wall (Divinyls), and Rip Her to Shreds (Blondie), it's a must have. Unfortunately I only have the cassette, am searching long and hard for the cd. As a whole though, NIGHTMARE 4 is one of my favorites among the series, and anything you can get associated with it will be a good choice."
3,nightmare on elm street part 4,"this is good but the original soundtrack is better, as for u guys that cant find ""nightmare,"" by Tuesday Knight, i couldnt find it either, however, i recorded it into a wave file, while was playing the movie, and thats how i got it, so get it that way! =)"
4,A Quality Tool,"So far so good. Has a pretty good feel. I would recommend it. Klein Tools never disappoint, in my experience."
2,Not the Same.,"After I've used 3 other bottles bought from regular salons, I was thrilled to find Bumble & Bumble Holding Spray on Amazon with such good prices. It's a very good spray and environmentally friendly, too. I was able to pour into smaller spray bottle for traveling. Unfortunately this bottle I ordered from here didn't look or smell quite the same as the leftover liquid in my current bottle. My current spray has a clean refreshing scent, but not this one. Needless to say, I quickly return it the next day."
1,Counterfeit Item,"This is not the real product. I am a long time user of this product and usually purchase it from my hairdresser however, this time I decided to order it on-line to see if I can get a better price. Hah! Yeah right. Sure this fab product is less money from this particular seller but,it's not the real thing. It is much stickier, does not hold my curls the same, and even smells different. And on top of all that, the product arrived sticky and damaged.They said to return the product for a refund, but at this point, why bother. By the time I pay to return it, I will have spent the money again. Lesson learned...never again."
1,Bumble?,"If this is Bumble and Bumble I will flap my non-existent wings and fly. Think twice, the bottle matches somewhat but it is not holding spray as advertised in my opinion."
1,If I could give it 0 stars I would have,I have very fine hair now live in the hot humid south and was desperate to find a new hairspray. After reading reviews decided to try this. My first try was a horrible experience. This stuff stuck my hair together so bad I could bearly comb through it to get it out! Terrible product. What a waste of my money.
5,I have tried them all and this one tops them!,"I have a thick head of hair, ride a motorcycle and when I get off my bike my hair looks just like it did when I got on it!"
3,Faith Evans,"On her new album ""Keep The Faith"", Faith Evans suped it up a notch with 2 hit dance-hall gems: ""All Night Long"" and ""Love Like This."" Her new album also features slower love songs, which she's originally known for from her first bangin' album, the self entitled ""Faith."" The first album is also just as good with the hit songs ""Ain't Nobody"" ""You Used To Love Me"" and a duet with soulstress Mary J. Blige called ""Love Don't Live Here Anymore."" I recommend checking out both albums which feature production by commercial rap star Puff Daddy. Just look for my trademark name atop the review and you can trust that it's gonna be true and informative. ~Peace."
1,Not typical of Henley,"Boring to say the least. I was so disappointed in this book that I felt that Henley had penned her name to another's book in desperation to meet a deadline!The heroine was so unlike her previous heroines whom historically are strong willed, feisty, outspoken and downright physically violent at times. This particular heroine was a 'mouse' in my opinion. No guts, no gumption, and the book was received by me with no glory. The hero, I found him to be naive in the matters of female reproduction. Having a mistress for years, one never wondered why she never conceived? The mistress was so shallow that even he should have seen through her vindictive behavior. As for his sister, well, I believe she was transported through time travel from another era due to her language and prose and her psychological analysis of men."
2,Not as interesting as her other books can be,Henley has written a few very interesting historical novels but this is not 'it.' The book turned to be outright boring and not as much a pleasure to read.
3,Slow read but ...,"OK. I skimmed the last 100 pages. It was too long and yes as someone mentioned already, the war detail got a bit tedious. I agree with some others, Lynx was not very kind with the heroine the first few nights. I did not like this either."
2,one gem,"Every once in a while, someone snags a Prince song, covers it, and makes themselves a nice little hit (e.g. ""Nothing Compares 2 U""). No one's done it yet with ""Love's No Fun"" off this album, but it's a gem of a song just waiting for it. Can't say that Elisa does it justice, either, unfortunately."
2,Wrong disc was sent. It had just one old Benny Goodman track on it.on it.,"I was sent the wrong disc. No Stan Kenton, just an old Benny Goodman track. And would you believe, only one tune on it. The rest was blank. Someone screwed up.I flung the thing in the garbage. So nothing to reurn,as it wasn't on the previous list of my purchases, I thought I had not been charged.Never mind, I'll try somewhere else.Regards, Terry"
3,Disappointed,Definitely not a beginner workout. Found it difficult to do alot of the exercises. Not for someone with minimal flexibility.
2,Not a true stretch dvd,"This dvd includes some stretching but also push-ups, balancing on one leg and other hard to get into yoga movements. I really wanted a static stretching dvd so I could work on my flexibility... not to work on my strength or balance. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone looking for a stretch dvd, and as for a regular workout it's too light. It's a little bit of strength, balance and stretch - but not enough of any one of those things."
3,Very good product,"Next time I'll order full size, the 2oz is to expensive, I needed a travel size, I haven't have good luck with the travel bottles from the store. I will save this little bottle for my future travel"
4,A childhood favourite revived!,"I grew up reading these ""Dragon"" stories. I recall the summer reading program at the St. Charles Public Library that I was a part of, and how my name filled one entire side of the card for ""The Dragons of Blueland."" I must have read these books a dozen times or more as a child.Last Christmas, my wife surprised me by getting this volume for me. I had not seen these books since I was a child -- I was not even aware they were still in print, and had forgotten the name of the author. I read them again, and was as delighted at 29 as I was at 9.These tales have a dream-like, innocent quality that has made them personal favourites for two decades!"
2,"Please, this is not the ultimate guide but a beginning","Like another reviewer, I also have found a few more interesting books that are more in-depth and more down to earth. I'm not the yuppie type who will have a fortune to spend when I do retire, and I'd say this book is bound to appeal to that particular crowd.Far more interesting and appealing is the series written by John Howells over the past decade. He seems to have put more time into his books and goes into more depth overall; he and his wife have made it their business to RV-it all over the place and personally check things out, staying all different places and getting to know the folks who live there. I like that. His ""Retirement on a Shoestring"" is great, whether you end up living that way or not."
5,EXELLENT QUALITY,"Excellent video & audio quality. A very entertaining & fun performance that was enhanced by the excellent guest keyboard player. The solo dancer for ""Big Bottom"" complemented the jazzy tone of that song remix."
4,Good to hear them again,"Had a tape of this some time ago; made the mistake of putting my tape holder over the gas tank on a long drive when I moved. The tape actually melted into the the back of tape holder. Had trouble finding the CD of it in stores; fortunately I found it here. So what do I actually think about it?Minor late 80's classic by another great Canadain export; aggressive guitar hooks, quirky lyrics sung with abandon by Moe Berg and beautiful accompaniment by Kris Abbott & Leslie Stanwyck, all done to a boppin beat. Power pop at its finest."
5,Pursuit of Happiness,"A group that fell through the cracks, it's produced by Todd Rundgrenand the single is ""I'm an Adult Now"""
3,"Half-right, with Some Good Insights","Johnston has some good suggestions on the important topic of practicing, especially helping students with time management issues, and the importance being absolutely clear in their weekly assignments. But I think the author is too quick to recommend too many games, with their tendency to distract students from the joy and responsibility of making music.He's very weak in the area of solving technical problems and memorization issues with MUSICAL solutions. ""Hear it, Visualize it, Play it"" seem to be not in his vocabulary.Overall -- too wordy, to mechanistic, not sufficiently musical in its approach."
2,Why Put Forth the Effort?,"Gore Vidal's ""Julian"" is one of my favorite all-time books, so I thought I might enjoy another on the subject. All-in-all I was disappointed and only managed to make it about 3/4 of the way through with much effort. Though the author's writing style is quite readable, writing a story from the viewpoint of someone who diliked Julian and is supposed to be his friend just didn't cut it with me. The self-righteous Christian got old real fast. And the secondary characters like Oribasius and Maximus were so vividly done by Vidal as to make them a jarring, discordant note in this work. The only way it was in any way better than Vidal's work is the battle descriptions, which are well done.To me it was like someone trying to re-write Gone With the Wind, To Kill a Mockingbird or A Confederacy of Dunces. It can't be improved upon, so why put forth the effort?"
2,Consumer caution - product description,"I paid more for this product because it was described as being in tablet form. (Many medical dictionaries describe a tablet as round and compact). In fact, it is a long, thick capsule. If you have trouble swallowing, this may not be a good product for you. It does contain the supplements listed, which have helped my old knees. Since I've been taking Glucosamine Chondroitin, I can walk further without discomfort. I recommend the supplements, but not the form."
5,Nice one!,"Excellent selection of tracks and music. I thouroghly enjoyed the journey that this CD takes me through. It reflects Kazell's live dance sets. I definately recommend this CD to anyone is new to dance/electronic music.This compilation is a definate crossover of genres that will make you dance and enjoy the music.Nice one, Kazell."
3,This book is not worth the money or even your time!,"I did not like this book because all's the author did was take quotes from other books or magizines and make them into a book! The only thing I enjoyed was the pics of Stevie! The pics were great! No wonder Stevie did not help, the book was terrible. The only reason I got it was tosee the great pics, but they too are weird! they are all in black and white and the author does not even give a caption! So save your bucks if your looing for something to read, if alls you want is unexplainable pictures this is your book!"
3,Two excellent songs,"The first two songs are excellent, they worth the purchase. I'm not so sure about the others..."
2,This is a lot of things but certianly NOT brilliant,"nor is it jazz in any way, Miss Toni has a lovely singing voice but it doesn't blend well with jazz and swing, anymore then putting say Peewee Herman fronting a big band, it might be charming at 1st but gets very dull. Toni's vocie is alright here, but she seems to be lacking the meaning of the standards, and conviction, as well as a sense of rhythm, timing, and technical skills that are essential for a swing singer. She may be able to pass as a caberet singer along the lines of Mabel Mercer, but this cd doesn't work well, because after one or two songs you begin to realize taht Toni's run out of cliches and ideas, she essentially copies styles of past singers, using so many cliches, she's bound to fool some into thinkign she actually can pull this off, but in reality this emberessing session, should never have been released."
3,"Okay, for the price. Cheap chain.","This was probably worth the discounted price I paid...the previous reviews were absolutely correct; it is suited for a child or small person, although it touts an 18"" chain. The chain is very cheaply made and that 18"" is a stretch at the outside link of the adjustment, which has no ""tail"" link to use for fingertip feel. Likewise, the hardware on the other side is so conservative of materials that it is difficult to even hold the very small ring open long enough to reach the back of the neck when trying to put it on without assistance. The butterfly is nice, but just that...nice. If I had it to do over again, knowing now...I wouldn't have ordered it. But there's nothing faulty enough to warrant sending it back, either. Again, for a child it is a lovely size and gift."
4,Good Condition,The VHS tapes were delivered on time as promised with no damaged. I may keep these tapes as they and video cassette players will be ancient history soon. The vendor was easy to work with and the material was exactly what I needed.
1,Boring & annoying,"I agree with the other complaints that this film is very staged. The crew knew nothing about Beavers - as seen in the 'making of'.... but what was most disappointing was that I was expecting and exciting IMAX movie and my kids (7 & 5) couldn't be more bored. After the first 3 minutes, they wanted to turn it off. So much for an educational movie!! The black & white is annoying and the music is dreadful."
1,Watch out for the Dvd Disk,No reviews for this video as the disk I have got has nothing recorded on it and it has a flat and rough gray inside surface with no silver surface of recorded movie and when inserted into the player a message of No Disk is displayed. As the shipping cost is to be born by the buyer in case a DVD is defective and in my case the shipping cost is much more than the DVD as i have to ship in from India. So I can just throw it in the garbage bin and suggest you guys that kindly watch out for this disk.
4,Kershaw onion blur,"nice knife, but would have liked it to be a bit bigger.good edge and stays sharp and good for pocket carry"
5,"Very plain, but nice!","The plate is nice and large, I just wish it had a bit of color other wise it's a good plate to serve your turkey on."
3,"An ""Inspired By"" CD","I'm not too fond of the ""Inspired By"" CDs... This CD was just OK. I wish they would have released the actual show music instead."
1,This is a joke...,"1-2 songs are OK, that's it...The show must be good, but the music.... two thumbs down.Early Cirque Du Soleil CDs are great."
1,Why the high cost?,My 1 star rating is for the price. Why is this remaster so much more then the others? It is the only Armored Saint cd I do not have.
3,"Unfortunately, as usual, try reading the book","A decent film about a young woman's battle with Mental illness. I would guess though that the book was better. The ending of this seemed rushed. Unfortunatley, the movies seemed choppy, melodramatic, and just kinda blah. Worth watching, kinda interesting for a person that works in the field."
1,Quit your crying and move to a third world country!,All I have to say to the author of 'Prozac Nation' and the main character in the movie is to quit your crying and move to a third world country! Then we will see how sorry you feel for yourself. You will see some in people in real pain and suffering. Then we will see if your life is as bad as you think.
3,Read the Bell Jar,"I expected a lot from this movie -- maybe too much. It seemed like a rip-off of Sylvia Plath's The Bell Jar. I know it's based on another book, but I got more out of The Bell Jar than this. Still, the movie wasn't that bad. I think I just expected too much. The stand-out part of this movie is definitely Ricci's acting job -- it's superb."
2,I bet Ricci's tear ducts needed some prozac after filming this cry-a-thon,Christina Ricci is a great dancer. I bet clubbing with the Ricci would be a night to remember.The problem is that Ricci's manager let her take a role that required her to weep in at least 50% of her scenes. I can't think of a single actor who can pull this off. And neither does Ricci or Lang.
2,book is better than the movie,"I read Prozac Nation about a year ago and by the time I got to the end of it I found myself with a book full of underlined paragraphs. The book was indeed very good, and truly depicted Elizabeth at her most vulnerable state. That being in a void of depression and knowing that the only thing responsible for it was herself.No sooner than finishing the book had my friend pulled out a japanese release of it on DVD. The more I watched the sicker I got. The movie turns Elizabeth's character into a ""fated teen"", displaying her as if the back of her hand was indefinately attached to her forehead. Simply overdramatic and very annoying.Now dont get me wrong, I love Christina Ricci. I loved her most in The Opposite of Sex, which was just another display of how amazing she can be on screen. It wasn't her performance in Prozac Nation that disappointed me, it was the overdramatics of it all that did."
3,"Great Acting, but story fails to show a clinical depression","The movie was good and deserved a theatrical release, I think many would enjoy it.However, like the book, the protagonist comes off whiny and not realistic.There is no doubt from random snippets she gives that she is suffering from a clinical depression.Perhaps, even the author is too scared to approach her real feelings, as depression is so much more than the arguments with her parents and the paranoia with a boyfriend. Which is why I do think she comes off as whiny- her problems and depression do not seem unavoidable.The movie is good for what it is, but I do not think it illustrates an actual experience with clinical depression very well."
5,Excellent book for those who question their testimony,Reminds you of what you know and take for granted but it also gives you more information. It is an excellent book for those who question their testimony. It is amazing to read all this excellent information in a condensed manner that makes it so easy to read. Most enjoyable.
5,"Contributions, (Ted Shine)","This product fulfills my need to accumulate meaningful, and AfroCentric plays. The storylines are superb culminating in the final play of this triptych of ""Contributions"" which gives meaning to the way in which the Jim Crow system of the South was resisted -- on every hand -- by many female members of the Black Community. It should not be long before this play is presented in a venue in my community."
2,Only a Shadow of his previous DVD,"I strongly disagree with the previous reviews of this latest live DVD by Tommy Castro. This performance is only a shadow compared to the high energy and excitement of Castro's ""Live at the Fillmore"" DVD. The main culprit is simply the quality of the songs themselves, which was much stonger on the Fillmore DVD. The contrast between the two DVDs is so striking that it almost seems like two totally different bands on each DVD. I enjoyed every single song on the Fillmore DVD and comparatively didn't find even one song on this newer DVD holding my interest. This is a severe drop in Tommy's work that I hope is reversed before it's too late."
4,A Good Bargain But Case A bit Bulky,"I bought this from the seller SF Planet and it is exactly as pictured and described in the description. Genuine Sony leather case with magnetic snap closure and Sony NP-GB1 Rechargeable Lithium Ion Battery Pack in full blister pack retail packaging.I will note that the leather case has a rather stiff front with about 1/8 of an inch padding. Making it a bit bulky. So take this into account. It's not just a leather pouch. The back is not as stiff as it is just a thick-ish piece of leather with a soft non-scratch lining. I used it with my Cyber-Shot DSC-HX5V camera and it just fits with no room to spare. It's a tight fit. No room for anything else inside. There are no other compartments or pockets.Overall, I'm happy with the purchase as it's a real bargain since the battery alone would cost about that much (~$25) and the leather case is of good quality construction. It's just a little bulkier than expected/hoped."
5,Wrong battery but satisfactory replacement BuyAccessories nice customer service,"I bought this kit almost 2 month ago from BuyAccessories and the intention was to get a second battery as a backup. The case was the Sony brand however the battery wasn't. I didn't pay attention then but found the battery didn't even work later. I contacted the BuyAccessories and got prompt response. They acknowledged that they might make a mistake and let me exchange for the real Sony brand battery even 2 month after the puschase. Although it started with a mistake, the excellent customer service still impressed me a lot. Now the case and battery work very nicely."
3,Cybershot case and battery,"Battery is great. Case is OK. My complaint is that it is way to bulky for the nice, trim Cybershot camera. I realize it ia a generic Sony case and it does appear to protect the camera well, but the case is too big and blocky. I would not buy this again. I would buy the battery separately and shop for a cell phone case for the camera. My cell phone case fits the camera well, is half the price and is trim which is what I wanted.RB"
5,LAUGHTER ALL THE WAY TO THE COMPUTER STORE!,"I have a number of New Yorker cartoon books purchased nearly 15 years ago. They are ALL hilarious. I return to them, again and again, either just to read and enjoy them, or to photocopy several to send to a friend....The ""Technology"" cartoons are ""up there"" with all the other one I purchased (years ago). I'm especially fond of the cartoon of the back cover of the dust jacket...But they are ALL good! I would recommend this one, especially for someone who is ""high tech"" oriented, although aren't we all, these days. We recently purchased the ""technology"" book for my son's music teacher, who was seriously ill for half the year. Last year, we bought him -- and all my son's teachers -- the ""teacher"" cartoon book. Since there is no New Yorker book of ""music"" cartoons, we selected the ""tech"" cartoons...we hope he is chuckling, despite his illness."
4,Pretty ring and great price,"This ring is going to be my wedding ring in a few months. The price is great and it's very pretty. The band is very thin and there is no way to engrave it, so keep that in mind. Also, the diamonds are unevenly sized, but it's only noticeable upon very close inspection, and for the price you can't expect perfection. It definitely seems like a great starter ring."
3,Why did only HALF the book arrive?!,"I invariably fall for an idealized heroine who must meet life's challenges and learn life's lessons as she waits for her Prince Charming to wake up. Belinda is a delight. However, the hardbound copy which I received for Christmas only included the first half of the book! I have written the publisher, and received no response--this is a mystery. I would have liked to give 2.5 stars to represent the half of the book received."
1,Piece of junk,"This hairdryer was fine while it lasted, which was about 3 months. It started smelling as if it was burning when used. Then it stopped working completely. It was never dropped or damaged, and was only used by one person, drying their hair once a day. I emailed Amazon to find out how to get a replacement, and they never responded. I finally called Amazon, and they informed me that after 30 days one has to contact the manufacturer. The manufacturer's written materials say you have to ship it back to them, and pay them $8 for return shipping. They then will repair it. Thanks, but for all the hassle of packaging, shipping, and paying for postage back and forth, only to get a ""repair,"" it's just not worth it. I don't expect a hairdryer that cost almost $70 to fall apart with minimal use after three months."
5,great hair dryer!,"Hi there - I love this hair dryer. The nozzle is small and very easy to control as I straighten my hair. It is hot enough to really get it straight, but I don't feel like i am burning my hair (and it doesn't smell like i am burning my hair!) it dries hair quick. It's a little heavy, but it's hardly enough to not get it. I highly recommend this dryer!"
4,best professional dryer under $100,"This dryer smooths hair better than any other, i compare to bio ionic t-3 and the awful chi, Elchim is far the best dryer!! It is a little heavy just a little and it is loud though, live with that and you'll be very happy. My hair feels great no split ends and my clients leave with a fantastic fast smooth blowout."
2,Not as powerful as I would have expected for the price.,Nice blowdryer but for the price not worth it and I have owned ohehundred dollar blow dryers.I know the difference
1,Elevator Christmas music,"This CD was so boring, the same sound from the beginning to the end, just right for elevator music. Absolutely uninspiring. I spent only $2.50, but I still didn't get my money's worth."
2,Frustrating,"It doesn't really keep out the ants, they seem to know how to crawl under it to drop onto the bird feeder."
2,Somewhat of a disappointment.,"This CD is okay...but not as great as I was hoping it would be. All of the songs are covered by one group (obviously, the Groove Machine) and none are near as good as the originals."
4,chess,"for me this book helped, but at the same time hurt. my class it turned out needed a different style of chess then this book showed. it did however help me with the basics and teach me some new tricks! i was able to complete the class just fine between the book and teachers worksheets he handed out."
2,Not much of a performance,"The performance is by a five piece string ensemble, not a band as someone stated. A band has wind instruments and no strings. So, I assume the person was reviewing something else. They also stated that the performance had a soprano and a counter-tenor. It does not. It has one soprano who appears to be singing this with no practice. She looks only at the music and never looks up, therefore, I assume it was performed without an audiance. I am in a classical choir, and none of the soloists have ever showed up at rehearsal so unprepared as this soloist."
3,"audio issues, otherwise not bad","This is an excellent performance of essential Poulenc; I would enthusiastically recommend it were it not for one inexcusable flaw: there is so much audio compression/limiting of the peak levels it completely spoils the experience, for me at least. Ruins the dynamics, squashes the larger crescendos into mush; you can actually hear the compressor shamelessly kick in and release, like the mix engineer set it on autopilot, clicked OK, and went out for a beer. Really sad, that music like this would get the kind of treatment you'd expect in some dime-a-dozen top-40 pop song. I'd love to hear the unprocessed audio, 'cause it's easily a four-star performance and a good overall recording (btw, I can speak only for the stereo mix, not the Dolby Surround, which I'm not equipped to hear)."
3,i'm a huge stevie fan but...,the book (for 15 bucks) was not as i expected it to be. i expected it to be more like a biography. but mostly all the author talked about was his experianses writing the book. the pictures and paintings were good though.
2,Very mystical as you don't find out much about her...,"What you do get is B&W photos that are rare and voluminous. It took me 20 minutes to read the convuling text but hey I'm a big fan, I enjoyed it but I reckon I could write a better bio. Strictly for avid Nicks chicks or guys.Margaret J Perry"
1,not that into it,I tried watching this movie and I was lost. I also think that Angelina Joline wasn't made for that part. She was suppose to play the nice fragile sister of John. Because of her past movies it was hard for me to see her like that. She looked out of places.
3,The Good Shepard,The film and the actors were very good. The exception was Angelina Jolie who seemed at times to be coasting through the film. The script tried to cover a long piece of history and did not carry it off. I am familiar with the era and was a bit disappointed.
1,"Long, slow, boring and unrealistic.",I kept waiting to see the good part of this movie and it never happened. Too much time line switching and unrealistic in that nobody has ice water in their veins like Damon did. However he typically crawled into bed with anyone who would go.I love a good spy spoof but this one stunk.
4,The flipside of James Bond,"In director Robert DeNiro's ambitious film, the professional rise and spiritual fall of Edward Wilson (Matt Damon) through the ranks of the CIA reflects the evolution of that organization from its creation in the wake of WWII until the debacle at the Bay of Pigs. The character of Wilson is much like the film itself: enigmatic, quiet, and tightly controlled. Some may be put off by the long running time and the lack of big action scenes, but more patient viewers will be rewarded with a compelling presentation of the psychological damage caused when mistrust is the normal state of human interaction. Wilson emerges as a tragic figure, having gone into government service with the best of intentions but, step by step, coming to the point where he becomes responsible for horrific acts.DeNiro does a fine job in his second film as a director. He has assembled an excellent cast, including some outstanding cameos."
1,One of the Worst Spy movies of all time!,"Without a doubt, The Good Shepherd is one of the worst spy movies I have ever seen and I think I have seen almost all of them. I'm not sure where to begin with how bad it is. The main character Edward Wilson is absolutely lifeless and there is zero explanation as to why 3 women find him attractive. There is zero explanation as to how he advances as he seems to do nothing. There are so many contradictions, dead ends, events unexplained and mistakes that you would think an amateur wrote this film. The movie is deliberately dark so as to give the Cloak and Dagger mystique but it fails miserably. And the worst part is it tries to shed the fictional cloak by trying to tie itself to real world events but again fails with so many mistakes that it becomes simply boring and ludicrous. Based on the critics reviews I had high hopes for this movie but I usually find that when the critics hail a movie that it is a bad sign."
5,Excellent!,Great story & performance by Damon and Jolie. Based on the launch of the CIA this is worth it! I recommend viewing it in subtitles because they speak so much of the time in such low tones I found myself watching it over and over trying to piece it together. Pay close attention to way the movie begins so that you understand the ending. You may still find that you want to watch it again!
2,the company man,"The main character is a tool and I don't like him and I don't like his terrible life but that's not why I didn't care too much for this film (of course). It's entirely possible to do a movie about an unlikable and even bland character that makes him interesting and sympathetic. In this character study the creation of an even mildly compelling character whose life we take any real interest in was simply not accomplished. This isn't to say Matt Damon did not act well because he seems to have turned in a decent, understated performace that was befitting of the role. The fact that this is a story about a strange man whose life is his work that is also the story of the birth of the CIA lumps it together with a whole slew of movies that affect for the worse my reaction to this espionage, cold war spy drama. Seems like it could have been a lot more engaging to me, and no I don't mean more action. THE GOOD SHEPHERD is an odd film."
3,Good acting but dull and uninteresting...,"""Good Shepherd"" is an epic story about Edward Wilson (Matt Damon), a CIA agent in the cold war era of the '60s. The movie goes back and forth in time from the 20s to the 60s starting from Wilson's college days at Yale, where he joins the society of Skulls and Bones and then gets mentored to perform counterintelligence tasks. The movie is interwoven with multiple flashbacks, which I didnt like and felt wasnt really necessary. Every director has to follow the nonlinear timeline technique these days just to make it look like an ""intelligent"" movie. In spite of boasting the best ensemble cast seen in a long time, the movie is very long and will easily put you to sleep after the first hour. The pacing is just too slow and makes it hard to concentrate for almost 3 hours. With better editing, ""Shepherd"" could have been a front runner at the Oscars."
3,Disappointing,"This is a potentially fascinating story that is badly mishandled by Mr. Deniro.Tedious pacing, clumsily presented symbolism and some poor casting decisions (Angelina Jolie, for one) make for a a dull and frustrating film. The relentlessly dark visual atmosphere of the film serves only to exacerbate the deadened quality of the script and direction.Its only saving grace is the actual story that it is trying to tell. It is a shame that a more talented director hadn't made the film."
5,My opinion,The first time I saw the film I was left confused. It took 3 viewings to really understand and then I cried. I really think fewer actors would have made the confusion less. I do believe this is a very very good film but again unless you are exceptional at following a script you will have to allow another viewing or two. I did really love it though and it will always leave me guessing about the subject and WHAT IS REALLY THE TRUTH behind the curtains. Finally this film reconfirmed my doubts of our government's honesty and their ideas and actions.
3,"Decent overall, but not what I was expecting for a CIA movie","This was an enjoyable movie to watch, but honestly, it lacked pace, action, and adventure.I bought this movie because of the cast, and they performed brilliantly as always. It's not the actor's fault the script was slow paced.I do recommend this movie to add to your collection. It's enjoyable, but not a blockbuster in my personal opinion.I give it a 3, right down the middle.Give it a shot, and judge for yourself.--James Michael Collins--"
2,Lacks freshness and it's filled with skulls and bones...boring,"I just didn't like this movie, despite it has some of my favorite actors and actress (Jolie). They all do their jobs well but the story never picks up, it's slow, boring, and filled with cliches (oh by the way she is pregnant; oh no, really?!--compare this to the pregnancy dilemma in ""The Last King of Scotland""). It doesn't show or tell anything we can't guess, nor care. If I were a betting man, Damon probably didn't like this script; but because De Niro is behind the project he probably gave it the green light. Jolie probably needed the money to adopt more kids. This movie is perfunctory at best."
2,My friend literally tricked me into seeing this (but I didn't fall for the trick),"When my friend and I were bored one night, we decided to watch The Good Shepherd on DVD. My friend saw it in theaters and said it was a waste of money (4 months ago). I knew it was boring, everyone said so, but still, I wanted to give it a chance. He also wanted to give it another chance. Well, that wasnt the case. I had to leave in the first 20 minutes because it was that bad. The only reason he wanted me to see it cause he wanted me to suffer through it like him. HAH! Well I knew better. I came back for the last 15 minutes of the movie (it was still on). I didnt understand what happened, but had I watched it through, I still wouldntve understood. Haha, my friend was so mad at me for not having to watch it.Watching this movie is like being shot with a tranquilizer. You better escape before it gets to you."
4,Very well done,"I usually do not feel compelled to write reviews but after reading all of the negative ones for this film, I felt like I should; I saw it in theaters and enjoyed it so much that I bought it when it came out a couple of weeks ago. Yes, the movie is long and slow in parts such as the beginning, but it's still extremely well done. I'd really give it 4 1/2 stars but it's not an option - the only thing keeping it from the full five stars is its length (nearly 3 hours). It is an interesting story with a unique inside look at things we otherwise do not get the chance to see - not just the beginning of the CIA, but also of the infamous Skull and Bones secret society of Yale. The cinemetography is beautiful and all of the cast gives believable, strong performances. So, while it is long, it's also gripping and compelling. I don't see where all of the bad reviews are coming from because it is a generally good film that keeps you enthralled with the story - and it's a good story."
4,Well crafted but cryptic,"Was I the only one who had trouble following the plot of this film? This is not usually a problem area for me, but there were so many characters and short, cryptic encounters that I found several scenes plain confusing. The terrific cast is not given much leeway, and the Matt Damon character, in particular, has an emotional repertoire that ranges from A to B; while clearly the intent of the film, it offers few clues to his inner life. And while the film did an an amazing job of recreating past eras (the suburban scenes looked exactly like of our old family photos) I was also troubled by the blending of factual context and fiction. I give it 4 stars more for the production values than for the content."
1,The Longest Film Ever Made(at least thats what it felt like),"I was very optimistic when I watched this film. I expected a good or excellent movie. WOW was I wrong. First of all, I was totally baffled by the main character, played by Matt Damon, as he was lifeless and only had like three lines in the whole movie.This is the only movie I've ever seen where the main character didn't speak. Why were women attracted to him? I've never been attracted to mutes myself. Also the plot was a confusing, jumbled mess. I think this film committed the worst crime possible-it didn't give the viewer a reason to care about the characters or the plot.It was also a very boring film.Considering all the critics' hype I was expecting at least a marginally enjoyable film. Alas, not so.Also, wierdly, the deleted scenes are also very long and boringI hope Ocean's 13 and The Bourne Ultimatum will be more enjoyable. But I'm not holding my breath."
5,Bravo....,Very well written but even better portrayed. I applaud Matt Damon's performance. Thought provoking.
2,THE CRITICS BLEW IT ON THIS ONE,"A great cast is wasted in this long--make that lo-o-o-o-o-o-n-g--film that purports to be a fact-based film about the origin of the CIA. Perhaps the CIA really was formed as depicted in this insufferably boring film, but having Angelina Jolie inexplicably throw herself at Matt Damon's gloomy, robotic character calls even the most basic facts into question.But worse than that is the amateurish script. Each scene lasts about fifteen seconds before moving onto the next--often unrelated--scene. So we see the set up, say, of a scene, then the outcome, but not the drama in between. If you've seen a TV movie in the last few years, you may get what I'm talking about. I've read reviews comparing the film to ""The Godfather,"" but I sure don't see any similarities.Sure the movie looks great, but clearly the director/screenwriter/editor/producer--or some other Hollywood genius involved with the film--has no understanding of dramatic structure."
2,"""Bonesmen""... ""All Here"" ~ ""Agency First, God Second""","What a movie this could or should have been. Just think of it, Robert De Niro in front of and behind the camera, Francis Ford Coppola as one of the executive producers and starring Matt Damon and Angelina Jolie. Honey, get the popcorn!At least that's how it should have gone. Unfortunately the recent '06 film `The Good Shepherd' falls far short of my pre-viewing expectations. It is exceedingly slow, too long and the farthest thing from being a thriller than one could imagine. Damon sleep walks through this 2 hour, 48 minute snooze fest and Angelina is delegated to the role of a long suffering ignored housewife (as if that could happen).Alas, it could have been great. Who wouldn't enjoy a good conspiracy film involving an all powerful secret society like the infamous ""Skull and Bones"" working their way through the highest levels of American society and politics. I sure would, have you seen one?"
1,"Yay! it played fine, To bad it was Crap","Well it played fine on my XBOX 360 plugin, but to bad this movie sucked. Many times it was confusing as it switched back and forth between years, and many times whenever the actor was trying to be dramatic I guess he spoke so softly that you could barelly hear what was going on. It was long, and could have been greatly improved if only it was better edited. Lots a parts were just fine, but after nearly three hours, it was like get to the point ya'll. So if somebody could copy the movie to their harddrive, and then edit it themselves it might be worth watching. Oh well, major letdown unless your one of those artist types who thinks that you have to look beyond the picture to get the meaning."
1,NOT so great!!!,I read all the reviews and was extremely disappointed with my purchase. Don't waste your money on this one!
1,Wish you had a zero stars catagory,"This movie should be renamed: ""Matt Damon. . . Robot and Sleep Therapist,"" or ""Why We Should All Hate the United States of America. . . Before We Fall Asleep."" Hate the USA diatribe AND a bore."
4,Rice cakes,I have Celiac Disese and can't eat anything with gluten so I use rice cakes usually with peanut butter on them. It works.
3,POOR PACKING OF GOOD ITEM,"We know this is a good product, because we've been buying it for years in CT. While in FL we've been unable to find these rice cakes in any of the local stores, so we ordered an entire case from Amazon.com. Although the price was all right, the packaging was insufficient, and each of the packets that we opened was filled with broken pieces of the rice cakes. It's a shame to waste a good item this way, and I wouldn't order this or similar food items online again."
2,Repetitive to say the least,"This album is one of the few albums by a band that doesn't get me PO'ed every time I see them on MTV (i.e. KoRn, Limp Bizkit, Nickelback, etc.) It's just pure, hardcore rock without ridiculous rapping (like Fred Durst) and without the singer saying the f-word for fun when there's nothing else to say on the record. The only problem I have with the record is that it starts strong with Tracks 1-3, gets weak with tracks 4 and five then gets better with tracks 6-12, but weakens with similar sounding material as the beginning of the album. This is a good album, just not a great album that you can listen to the whole way thorugh."
3,An OK CD,"This CD suggests talent that is waiting to bud, but just hasn't found a comfort level. The CD is filled with Linkin Park styled themes, as well as a couple Christian-oriented songs. I highly recommend this CD for those of you who loved Linkin Park, Limp Bizkit, or Papa Roach, but don't like the hard edge and profanity. The CD's songs jump from head bangin' songs, to screamers, to dance-type songs, to reflecting songs. The CD is OK and not as edgey as some of its metal counterparts. I recommend borrowing a friend's CD first."
3,I really dont have that good of an opinion of it...,"I really dont get into mainstream radio rock. If you like it, can see why, adn im not gonna argue, but i odnt see too much excitement to it. I mean its okay at certain parts, but mainly its no good. I'm not gonna lie, i odnt own the cd, but ive heard some songs:Set it off-A cool hard rock song, awesome live (saw it on tv)Alive-Their big radio release, not really that goodBoom-I hate it, hate it, hate itYouth of the nation-I always liked this song, its pretty coolSatellitte-Almost as bad as boom, but i sing it alotWithout ya nothing-An okay hard rock ballad, good un til halfway thorugh.I hope this helps"
5,THIS IS THE BEST BAND!,"I have been listening to Christian music for pretty much ALL my life. I started thinking that christian music was boring but then I started listening to Dc Talk, Newsboys, Audio Adrenaline, Project 86, and POD. I really think that this is the best band and the coolest CD!"
4,Satellite is Alive,"As this CD plays on you'll find it has some soft parts to it. But the only song that was ok not great was ghetto. It was not really about anthing. The strong parts really make this CD become a 4 because ""Alive"" and ""Youth of the Nation"" are two of the best songs that POD have every written. Satellite is a CD for mostly people 10 and up it has some suggestive songs but it is good so buy it. It will make a great addition to your CD library."
4,An Improvement,"I was actually a little hesitant to buy this album, but it turned out for the better. At first I heard that P.O.D were coming out with a new album, I was a little skeptical to buy it. Then I heard there single ""alive"" and I thought it was worth a purchase. The c.d. is very good melodicly with great guitar and bass backing up sonny. It's diffenetly worth a buy. Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars if for a couple reasons. One, the reggae tracks are a little annoying and the two songs of just music and nothing else get old quickly. But all the other songs make up for those songs. Buy this c.d., it's worth the money. Favorite songs are tracks 2, 4, and 6."
3,"Good, not great","...This sophomore effort by POD certainly has its moments, yet it lacks the cohesion and energy of not only their last disc, but the Warriors E.P., which is still their best stuff. Pleasing, if not essential. The power of 'Alive' and 'Satellite' were almost enough to get me to buy it, but reason won over. Certainly worth checking out."
2,"For an awful genre, not bad.","Of the songs I've heard off this album which was played to me from a friend's car, I must say that the poser metal of it, poser being my phrase for anything in and of the rap genre, it wasn't so bad. The production is next to putting your head on a steel door and having someone pound on the door from the other side. Production is awful, musical instrument playing is okay, rapping is awful, songs are better than that of this genre. I give it two stars simply because they're less fake than Kid Rock which is not hard to accomplish."
1,Thanking the Warriors,"Oh yeah, the greatest cd of the year. You know they actually said that they wanted Youth of the Nation to sound ""Like Pink Floyd, just not so gloomy""!!?!?! Gimmie a break, this mall metal stuff needs to stop."
5,BUY THIS C.D.,"This is definatly my favorite c.d. I don't usually listen to p.o.d., they were a little too hardcore for me, but i heard alive on the radio, and i loved it so much. i debated for a while on whether or not i should buy the c.d. I didn't know whether or not i'd like it. I finally did and it turns out that i love EVERY SONG on the album. Seriously, if you're not sure whether or not you'll like it, this is the best c.d. i've ever had, and you've definitly have to get it! You'll love it"
2,Quite Mediocre...,"I been all great things about this album, but I bought it, and really it doesnt get much better after ""Alive."" I think this band is trying to be as commercial and marketable as possible, and I believe that caused for a not too impressive to an album I did like ""The Fundamental Elements of Southtown."" Some songs on this album are just horrible like ""Without Jah, Nothin."" Skip this album and pick up REVEILLE's new one ""Bleed the Sky"", for some real rap-metal!!"
3,It was An Okay book,"okay for starters i would recomend this book to someone else its very good and very very actually its one of the best books i have ever read not that i read many books because i dont i only read this book for school but, im glad my mom bought it for me i loved it its good at the end because i didnt think the grandfather was gonna die but he did but she did learn something from that im not gonna give it away but thats all thanks for my time and everythinglove alwayselysia"
5,Great guide!!!,"This very helpful travel guide is filled with important and historical information for anyone having an interest in the Lewis & Clark adventure, but most of all for those about to take the trip to follow their adventure. We are taking just such trip very soon and I am using this guide as one of my primary guides for our trip."
1,Not as useful as it could be ...,"Ive been writing grants for some years now and thought that I could make my life easier by purchasing the CD set. When I recieved the 2004 Guide to Federal Grants, I was immensely disappointed. Instead of creating a useful, cross referenced CD, they simply took webpages and their links and transferred them directly into PDF format. I could have done the exact same thing using Google and Adobe Acrobat. There are no cross-references, no additional information into grants, and tabs were not even written into the PDF to assist with nagivation. Instead, they recommend that you use the ""search"" feature available with Adobe Reader. It is NOT worth paying their asking price, go to your local NonProfit Resource Center instead or just do a Google search for Federal NonProfit Grant Sites."
1,Where's the Cutting Blade?,"I bought the last one Casio KL-750B, and a tape cartridge, (the tape was more than the label printer). I tried using it and discovered there was no cutting blade. Went back to the store, they said contact Casio. Did that, found no way to get a blade cartridge. So, this ""deal"" wasn't. Casio let me down."
5,The Desert Island Disc of All Time,"This record has some of the best lyrics I've ever heard. I've recommended this album to so many people in the past ten years, it's ridicuolus. No one I know who has listened to this CD has failed to be blown away and deeply moved. All hype aside, Jeffrey takes you to another place and this album is nothing short of breathtaking. This record still gives me goosebumps (not to be a freak, but tears sometimes too)and i've listened to it a million times.Tracks like ""Scares Me More"" and ""A Dark Love Song"" can either break your heart or fill your heart, depending on your mood.This guy is one of the most underrated songwriters of the past 20 years. While his subsequent records were a little spotty (although there are very high points on each), this CD just nails it.You will not be disappointed."
5,love this stuff,can always depend on this product. its really hard to find in the stores..use this product for everything. works great on sunburns to .Had to come on line to find it.and I always trust amazon. have never had any trouble there always fast on delevery.
1,Save your time and money,"This movie is really bad, not funny at all, save your time and money, do soemthing else than watching this !"
4,"I've never seen the TV show, but...","I wasn't disappointed by this film at all; in fact, I thought it was quite the hysterical adventure. What happens when the most pathetic police team in the country needs to save the rest of the cops in the country, and protect Miami? I anticipated very stupid humor, and there is tons of that throughout. This DVD stengthened my self-esteem too, as I realized that even a total moron can be a useful member of society, even while corrupting and destroying other parts of it. Great comedy and XXXcellent nudity throughout. Recommended for a funny evening...with anybody."
3,About what i expected.,I am a big fan of the show and I think fans of the show will definitely like this movie. It's basically one long uncensored episode. If you don't watch the show you probably won't like it.
2,Worst TV-to-Film Ripoff Since Battlestar Gallactica,"At it's best, the film is as funny as the TV show but due to the different venue, it was raunchier. As a whole, however, this is just a longer but less funny version of the television program. The story line is full of holes, the writing is of uneven quality. I have DVDs of the television series and have watched them more than once. I doubt that I will ever bother to watch this version again."
2,Way too simple for a college level Calculus course,"Although the comedic format of ""The Standard Deviants: Calculus, Part I"" is refreshing in its silliness, it is way too elementary for a college level Calculus course. There is also a glaring error in at least one of the lessons."
4,wonderful!,"being crazy by trying to figure out my 2 year old, i was very excited about this book. it had quizzes to take for both you, your spouse, and your childs personality types. with this information, i was able to better figure out the situations each of us needed ""individual space"" or more attention...i can better evaluate my son and more easily predict his temper tantrums. excellent book!"
1,Should be how to raise a wimpy pacifist and avoid meat,"Well I got to thirds of the way through it and had to through it across the room. The author is one of these feminist that only uses the famine pronoun. For me it makes for an awkward read and tells me that the intended audience is exclusively female.I love the examples that author makes with such surprise that she actually learned something about dealing with their child from her husband. How could a man know anything about raising a child..Finally, the total PC BS teaching that children should NEVER hit each other.. that it is just a half step away from nuclear war.. Should be called ""How to raise a wimpy pacifist and avoid meat""..FLING.."
4,Practical,"If you are tired of reading books on parenting that are full of academic based psychology, but that offer little in terms of practical application, this book may be for you. I have a new appreciation for my ""sprited"" child and have some tools that will help me work with her. My only critique would be that, based on the authors definition, any child may fall in the category of ""sprited"" or ""spunky"". But that's not so bad, because it means that any parent can gain some practical insight from this book. (As a sidenote, I also gained some insight into myself . . . a spirited adult)."
4,Fairly helpful,I found this book to be pretty comforting. It was nice to finally put what I deal with everyday into words. I wish the book was a bit more reader-friendly. I guess I was hoping it would be a little more straight forward with problems and solutions.
2,"Lovely watch, faulty strap!","As a nurse I need a watch with an adequate size face and a sweeping second hand. This watch was perfect in that regard, however, after only a month and a half the clasp just fell off!! Timex really goofed on this one. What a disappointment!"
2,Hard to Open,"We bought this thinking it would be a good walk thru gate. Both my husband and I had difficulty in opening it. You had to press down and jiggle it a bit, which then loosens up the mounting. After 2 days of jiggling it, I returned it. There are cheaper models out there that are easier to open."
3,"Great series, poor DVD production","Most people reading this review are probably familiar with the series already. If not, rest-assured it is wonderful and well-worth the money and time you will need to own this DVD set and watch it.I can only give the DVD production 3 stars, however. The transfer is fine and crisp, but aside from a moderately interesting 1965 documentary about the failed attempt to produce a film based on Graves' books, there is no additional material. Even sub-titles for the hearing impaired would have been a great addition, to say nothing of a director's commentary.Someday I hope someone comes out with a real collector's edition of this series. A commentary by an historian would be worth a lot to me."
4,Amazing Performances/Awful Sound,"This is an acting tour de force especially the performance of Sin Phillips who is absolutely brilliant. Unfortunately the picture is not very brilliant, nor is the sound, which is awful. I had to pump the sound level on the TV to the top level and turn on the stereo speakers and I still couldn't hear what they were saying at times. However, performances like these come along very rarely, especially today. I doubt you will see this kind of greatness on American TV again. Luckily they restored the original opening with the African dance. It had been cut for US audiences when originally presented in prudish American. I do wonder though if the scene where Claudius opens the door on Drucilla, after Caligula had eaten her baby, showed the horror of what he had just done. It seems to me that there is an abrupt cut in the scene as if we were meant to look inside the door but a censor decided we shouldn't see what was there. That has always bothered me!"
4,"I, Claudius","This is an excellent series, and the CD quality is very good. The series, when it first aired years ago on PBS, was considered a top production, and the acting and treatment of the subject matter stands the test of time."
1,Roman Freddy Krueger,"Given the popularity and critical acclaim of this series, I was disappointed to find this slice of ancient Roman ""history"" stripped of complexity or ambiguity-- or even any sense of historical accuracy. Instead, we get a Roman Freddy Krueger in the form of Augustus' wife, Livia, who is apparently responsible for engineering nearly every important episode in Roman history by either murdering or manipulating her way through the Roman empire, which, according to this series, must have been full of the most naively idiotic leaders in the history of the planet. Sorry to go against the critical grain, but I must vote to skip this one."
1,Item not received as of yet!,I have yet to receive this item!I am getting a little concerned because it is overdue along with another movie that was sent with it!
3,Inexcusably poor video quality,"While the quality of the video was mostly excellent, several scenes on at least 2 of the discs had a very visible pattern of horizontal white lines superimposed over the images."
1,It's no American or even Japanese version!,"No suspense, the subtitles are bad. I own both the American and Japanese versions, this one pales in comparison.Do not buy!"
5,I'll watch this Time After Time,"This movie has something for everyone: love, sci-fi, past and present, bad guy, hero, etc. This is definitely one of my favorites that I can watch over and over again. These 3 actors make this movie sensational. Get it!"
5,Naive but good,"Simply put: This is the version of ""Time Machine"" that I like most.It does have its naivete but this makes it really cute.Malcolm McDowell as H. G. Wells is really captivating and funny.I found the story more ""plausible"", in spite of the inclusion of Jack The Ripper, than the other versions of ""The Time Machine"" I know."
4,Have a Pail of Cold Water Handy,"As I read this book, I was so challenged by the scope of the author's incredible imagination and intelligence that there were times when I had to just stop and wait for my brain to cool down, for fear my hair might start on fire.I don't agree with some of his conclusions, but I doubt there are many who could write with more depth of field and creativity than this guy. The things he envisions are are almost incomprehensibly deep."
4,Free SF Reader,"A humanist galactic odyssey. This is one of those 'wow' books. If you are after stories involving a local character or person, I would not recommend this one. A tour de force of the imagination."
2,tedious and unrewarding,"I rather doubt Douglas Adams ""was thinking of Stapledon when he invented, in the Hitchhikers' Guide to the Galaxy [actually, in ""The Restaurant at the End of the Universe""]...the Total Perspective Vortex"", just as I doubt former Late Show host Johnny Carson was thinking of Stapledon when he parodied Carl Sagan with his ""billions and billions"" speech. Douglas Adams and Johnny Carson were quite capable of finding out for themselves, without help from Stapledon, that the universe is big and that time is vast.For that matter, it is a different thing for comics to harp on this simple-minded theme and for a science fiction writer who seems to take himself very seriously to do so. Rather than read ""Star Maker"" or ""The First and Last Man"", I suggest you read instead H. G. Wells's short story ""Under the Knife"", written several decades earlier. ""Under the Knife"" deftly and SUCCINCTLY puts the ""Total Perspective Vortex"" itself into perspective."
3,Not what was in the picture,"I was sent the wrong product 2 times. The drawer that was sent to me was not the one pictured. Amazon was great about returning it but then sent the wrong one again. I kept the 2nd drawer anyways because I was going to paint it white to match our crib. I lightly sanded it, spray painted it white and changed the handles to glass knobs. It turned out great and was the best deal I could find. It is working perfectly for storage. In the image it has wooden knobs and what was sent has pull handles. I had to fill one of the holes with stucko to make it work. For the price I am happy with what I got."
5,A pleasant read,"Burn a scented candle, cuddle up in bed, or light a fire for this pleasant read. Catherine's poems are graceful and elegant, smooth and toned, poetry that reads like ballet."
3,i bought this collection,the 5 dvds were superb. and i enjoyed watching them and have a better understanding of mm's and how she rose to fame from being in foster homes by marrying rich men.
1,Muzac of China,"The music on this CD has lost all of its original Asian influence and unfortunately sounds more like the music played on a merry-go-round. I was very disappointed that this CD is more of an interpetation of someone's idea of what Chinese music sounds like, than actual Chinese music."
1,midnightblue celebrities,"if your looking for real honesty to GOD pornographyyou had better chose another DVD because this one does not provide italot of AL GOLDSTEIN taking about it but never doing ""IT""also a very grainy shot of is that really barbara striestand?it looks like her nose but that's about it"
5,LOVE.,"My hair is extremely dry, thin, fragile, and damaged, usually super frizzy if I just let it dry/blowdry it. After just ONE use of this, my hair was super shiny and really soft. It also smells nice and fresh and detangles really easily, where without it I kill my scalp ripping through my hair with a brush. It makes your scalp and hair feel refreshed and even cleaner than when you just shower/wash it and don't use it. I've been using it for a couple weeks now and it's literally REPAIRING my hair. It used to look fried all the time and never looked healthy, but now when I let it dry with this stuff, its sleek and looks like I just got it cut! I use so much of this it's already about gone. I spray it on my scalp, ends, and everywhere, DOUSING my hair in it, and even though I use a tonnn on my hair, it never ever looks greasy or feels sticky. Totally worth every penny, and I'd recommend it to anyone with any type of hair."
1,imposter,"I fell in LOVE with this product and had been using it for a couple years ordering it from a beauty salon in Atlanta. Could'nt get it anymore through them....so was excited to find it offered on Amazon. However, am sad that I bought 2 bottles,only to find that I wasted my money because this IS NOT the same solution. It looks the same- but it leaves my hair coated and kind of heavy. All the other bottles I have bought in the past NEVER did that."
3,"OK, but not worth the price","I suppose it does what it's supposed to, but the smell is awful. Also, it tends to make my hair feel dry and wiry. I have thick, course hair to begin with, so it may produce better results in hair that is finer mine."
1,Not the Real Herman,"Just listened to you clip from Herman's Hermits. I was considering ordering this until I heard the clip, this is most definitely not Peter Noone. He is what made Herman's Hermits great, and would be my only reason to buy the cd.Why are you selling bogus material?"
5,Light and healthy,"This is a great hair product for damaged or grey hair, is light and doesn't have a strong perfume smell. It's a little pricey but goes a long way."
4,Showing the later great turn around,"If you ever need to see just how amazing a conversion C. S. Lewis had when he turned to be a follower of Jesus - just read this from his ""pre-Christian"" phase of life.His forlorn take on life and. negative view of the Almighty are passionately and personally revealed"
5,Absolutely Amazing!,"I first heard Nothingface from ""An Audio Guide..."" After I heard that CD, I HAD to check out Pacifier. These guys have everything that I'm looking for in music. They are excellent musicians that have a knack for writing catchy music. They often balance between soft (yet disturbing) lyrics and heavy metal growls. This is a must for any metal fans."
3,an okay attempt at a debut album.,Personally. I though that Audio Guide to Everyday Atrocity was better. It is thei sophomore effort and is more matured. You be the judge.
2,Eh.,"These guys are rather overrated in the underground metal category. This really isn't good and their others are not much better, if any. For good underground metal, try Nevermore. For some metal that is more like this, get ""Awake"" by Godsmack or ""Iowa"" by Slipknot."
5,Oh what fun!,This was a cute and fun little book. It's wonderful and at this price you can't go wrong!
4,"he might have been a one hit wonder, but I still liked him.","When i first seen him, I haven't thought much about him. I started to develope a crush on and listen to his song 'the one and only'raising up and than down the charts. I bought his only record released in US and I have no regrets. The songs are bouncing and catching and kept listening it in my walkman . IMO he's definitely a very talented singer/songwriter which shouldn't be suprising since he's son of Chip Hawkes from the 60's pop band the Trembleloens, I think. Don't know much about them.For what I could gather he made a film with Roger Daltrey of The Who called 'Buddy's Song"", which I heard did alright in the U.K."
5,Fun for all ages,"We original bought for our activity 9 month old! But it has turned into a favorite for his five year old sister! Our nine month cries if we try to pull him out of the seat! Great storage for pet cats, small dogs, baby, dolls, puppet, and stuff animals! OUr five year old fashioned a seat belt our of two of her belts! and attached a cat toy string! Great play toy for sister and brother! And endless entertainment and laughs for mommies and daddies!"
4,Best RV Toilet in Years,"This is the best RV toilet in years. It flushes everything down so easy and actually cleans as it flushes. I would have given five stars except it did not come with the connecting water hose from the base of the toilet, to the top rim of the toilet, this part had to be purchased seperately. Otherwise, it is great. Uses much less water than our 10 year old Thetford RV toilet and does the job well. I would recommend to anyone buying a new RV toilet."
1,Waste of money,"The heater doesn't produce heat unless you are 1 inch from the unit. My hair dryer gives out more heat than this unit. The fan does work, but not with the heat, so what good is that? Defrost my windshield with cold air? My car defroster (without heat) does the same."
3,good for what I paid,"it's an okay heater but if yu have a big car maybe should get the one that's a little more expensive, I took the cheap route lol"
3,It's ok.,"My heater in my Jeep went out and I live in a cold climate. I bought this heater to assist in defrosting my windshield (inside). It works ok for a 12v 180 watt heater. It will melt the ice if it is not too thick.Pros: It will get you out in a pinch.Cons: It is a little slow and does not heat up very fast, but what can you expect from a 180 watt device.Bottom line: Get this device if you do not have a reliable defroster and live in a place where it never gets below 20F, it will work good enough to make it to were you can see out of the window.**Do not expect this product to heat your car, it's not that powerful."
3,12V Heated,"A good product, but the heat it provides is only marginal. The price is good, but my fingers still got cold."
3,Great Finger Warmer,This unit lacks the heat to do any serious defrosting. Does a good job of warming up fingers!
2,heater,"the item is decent for the money you pay, but like the old saying ""you get what you pay for"" it wont defrost the entire windshield, just the small area that you put it against. My wife uses it more than I and says that it keeps her decently warm, tho sometimes she has to set the item where it is turned directly towards her in order to achieve this. I give it a 2/5."
1,Broken,Bought this as a Christmas present for my dad. Well he plugged it I'm before he went to store. Few minutes later got in truck in way to store and it stopped working. Disappointed. Plus it never blew hard anyways
5,Great resource for information,"This book was a great purchase. It explained the details and steps of a personal injury claim in plain english. It gave sample letters for different types of accidents and provided information relative to each state since state laws tend to vary. Unfortunately our accident ended up being to complex so we needed to hire an attorney, but if it remained a simple case, I'm sure we could have done just fine using this book."
4,"Great price, good info.","This book is fine, just as described. Only problem is that it is two editions too old and it clearly is just basic info.... speaking from experience: There is no step by step formula for anything in a claim or case or anything dealing with the law or laws. So, yes I would recommend to anyone needing basic steps and procedures but nothing more."
2,A valley between the hills...,"Generally, I consider ""Turn Back"" to be a downward blip in Toto's catalog between ""Hydra"" (one of my favorites) and ""Toto IV"" (probably the group's most commercially successful release). I don't know if the record was rushed, but that would seem to be a reasonable assumption considering what came before and after. To my ears, none of the songs really come up to the level one would expect from the other CDs which the group released during this period; there's an almost ""bland"" quality running through the whole record. As another reviewer said, this one is worthwhile mostly for completeness sake, and for the one or two songs which aren't total throwaways. Fortunately, better things were on the way from Toto..."
3,A definite downhill slide from their strong first album,"Two cuts off of this album are pretty good and could have been minor radio hits (""Live For Today"" and ""If It's The Last Night""), but overall this isn't a very good offering considering the collective talent in the band. Not much here will get your toes tapping. Only die-hard Toto fans will think this is worth their money. Check this out - the guitar riff in ""I Think I Could Stand You Forever"" is seemingly ripped off by Survivor in their song ""Can't Let You Go"" off of their ""When Seconds Count"" album."
3,The (unfortunately) often forgotten TOTO release,"The first time I heard ""Goodbye Eleanor"" I knew that I had to have this album. As the predecessor to the highly acclaimed TOTO IV, Turn Back didn't get the attention some of the other Toto releases. Although I didn't acquire it until much later, it is a natural addition to the Toto library and follows the Toto progression. At the time this was released, no one in LA was able to pull together a hook or belt out a power ballad any better than TOTO."
5,(Former) readers of the American Scholar yearn for Epstein.,"I couldn't agree more with the reviewer from Texas, so let me repeat the Texan: a formal indictment should be brought against Phi Beta Kappa for firing Joseph Epstein. The end of the American Scholar as we knew it was the first publishing loss of my young life; now I fully appreciate how lifetime 'New Yorker 'readers felt when William Shawn was dismissed. Anyway, I'm supposed to stick to the book. These essays, originally American Scholar columns, are a great pleasure. Thank you, Mr. Epstein."
1,Doesn't Last!,"I should have read the other reviews before buying. When I first got the unit, I was happy. I got pretty good results. After a year, just like many other reviewers note, the machine began to stop about half way through the cycle. Since this seems to happen regularly to people, it is clearly a design flaw, and the company should take responsibility. A few months ago, I would have rated this 4-stars (5 if it weren't for the noise level which makes it hard to hear the cracks). Don't buy unless they fix the problem unless you will be content to roast for only a year."
4,Works great for home roasting! 4 1/2 stars!,"I've been learning how to roast and this roaster is very user friendly. It roasts evenly, does a good job. It's easy to clean, portable and attractive. Presets work great (love the preset option availability)! One small complaint: you must wait 2 hours between batches for it to cool, and it only roasts 1 cup of green beans per batch. This may be wholly adequate for regular roasting, but Christmas roasting for gifts will be a nightly ordeal.Enjoy, I highly recommend this. [...]"
2,Worked great for 13 months,"As others have mentioned, the iRoast is loud. After a while though I found I was able to tune in a hear both 1st and 2nd cracks. Apart from the small quantity limitation, and an immediate return on my first machine, I found that it works well. After about 13 months, my machine now stops half way through a roast for no reason. If you buy this expecting it to work for less than 20 months - you wont be disappointed - otherwise, not built to last."
1,BORING SEX,I DO LOVE STORIS THAT HAVE VERY SEXY SCENES AND WHILE THIS BOOK HAD A LOT I THOUGHT THE SEX WAS VERY BORING AND NOT IMAGINATIVE- WE HAD NO CHEMISTRY BETWEEN THE CHARACTERS AND I GOT VERY BORED- THE STORY INTSELF WAS UNINTERESTING- I LIKE A BOOK THAT GETS YOUR HEART RACING AND YOUR BLOOD POUNDING- WHERE YOU REALLY CARE IF THE TWO CHARACTERS GET TOGETHER - I LIKE SEX SCENES THAT ARE NOT ALL THE SAME - A LITTE MORE RACY THAT JUST THEM DOING IT EVERY OTHER PAGE-IT'S HARD TO BELIVE THAT SEX CAN GET BORING BUT BELIVE ME THIS BOOK IS- I LOVE MORE INTERACTION BETWEEN THE CHARACTERS- SAVE YOUR MONEY- FOR A GOOD BOOK READE ALWAYS BY LYNDSAY SANDS-NOT THIS SLEEPER
2,Cowboys and Angels,"First of all the title is a misnomer. One guy who wears a hat and boots does not make a cowboy. So where are the ""Cowboys""?This movie was just plain weird. If you are looking for a ""western"" style romance...forget it. Adam Trese is nice to look at, but there has to be more to a movie than a good lookin' guy who happens to wear a hat and boots.The charactor evens says in the movie ""I'm not a real cowboy"". You couldn't drown in this movie if you were a tadpole!"
4,Sweet Movie,Nice predictable love story for the whole family. On the order of Touched by an Angel. Nice for a Sunday afternoon.
5,Fun with Fish,"I got these fish decals to put on the inside windows of my office ... trying to simulate a fish tank. Folks in the office love them, They are easy to move around the glass and some folks have been quite creative by placing the fish in ""interesting"" positions. This toy is a hit!"
3,Harmless & goooofy entertainment !,"If your into low-budget bloody cheese, then you will enjoy the hell out of this one. What a goooooofy movie!"
1,Worst editing I've ever seen in a mass-market publication,"I have been eagerly awaiting this series in Kindle format and now that I've got it I wish the publisher had waited a little longer and gotten the job done right. Typographical problems like ""96 THE NONBORN KING"" appearing in the middle of a paragraph, bad hyphenations, and mis-spellings are ruining the experience of an otherwise very enjoyable series of books. I read these in the mass-market paperback editions back in the 80's and there was nothing like this in those editions.I hate to give this one star when the story, including all the books in the series, deserves a 4 or 5, but Amazon really needs to step up here. These typos and mis-spellings are present in the first two books of this series, The Many Colored Land and The Golden Torc, as well. Unfortunately ""torc"" is mis-spelled as ""tore"" more often than not inside the books."
2,Throwaway Crap. ..,"This material is for only the staunchest completionist.These are outtakes from some session that should never have been released. It does nothing to enhance the reputation of these terrific musicians and only cheats the consumers out of their money. At best, there are two so-so cuts on this. Keep your money in your pocket."
5,Excellent!,This is a really lovely collection of Frenchy music--you really do feel transported to a cafe somewhere in France. I love it!
4,Agreeable French Sampler,A very pleasant selection of contemporary French jazz pop fusion that should please any Francophile.
4,French Cafe CD,A great cd of french music. Lovely cafe tunes that bring back the memories of sitting in a relaxing paris cafe....
3,"comme ci, comme a",Je n'aime que la moitié des chansons. I only like half the songs and hit fast forward a lot when I try to listen to this disc. Putumayo could have done better.
3,DVD,"I bought a 3 disk set for the second season of Becker. I am sure it is just a fluke, as it came in a timelymanner and was packaged just fine. But only the 1st and 3rd disk work. the second disk (8 episodes) doesn't work inany of my players and I tried it in all 3. I have no idea how to contact the seller other than this way, the feedbackbutton."
4,The New Work of Dogs,Easy reading....A collection of true stories of people and how they are emotionally connected with their dogs - not always to the dogs advantage. Anyway.....recommend it! But be sure to read it all the way to the end - where he offers some thought provoking insights.
5,Great Product,Wonderful stand. Sturdy. Easy to put together. Well worth the money. I looked for a stand very thourghly and was worried about purchasing on-line but this product met everyone of my expectations.
5,At last -- an AUTHENTIC story of building a business,"There's something irresistible about a business book that's as personal as this one. BEER SCHOOL is a great story -- and the founders/authors are wonderfully blunt about what it takes to get along with each other and get through hard times -- as well as what it takes to make a business come alive. Obviously, these are entrepreneurs who learned-by-doing, and the way they succeeded provides good adventure as well as good schooling. (And, P.S., they came up with excellent beers.)"
4,Light Plastic,These items work for our purpose but they are very light weight. Because of the light weight they are easy to remove once in place. My hopes were that they would be a little sturdier.
4,Krieger Straight Razor,"I bought this razor with some trepidation having read so many negative razor reviews generally and knowing it was very reasonably priced. I ordered it anyway and I love it. It needed sharpening of course, knives, etc. generally do when new. But it is sturdy, well made and attractive. It is a bit on the heavy built side, kind of a macho appeal I guess, not to extreme though. It took and is holding a very good edge. It is working better and giving me smoother shaves than my antique (truly, handed down) high carbon steel straight razor. I would recommend it to anyone, especially at the price. That is my experience. I've had it for about three of four weeks."
3,shaving,does not come sharp enough. had to send it out to get sharpened. it closes nice and tight and has a smooth opening. but the steel is not the best for shaving.
1,Don't do it,I bought this before I knew what I was looking for. It's a waste.These were what I was looking for:[...]
2,to look at not to use,blades stainless steel and not even hollow ground so although it looks beautiful it utterly worthless for shaving
3,Things you should know.,This would be great for a collector but if your serious about shaving this isn't the one for you. I tried to shave and it wouldn't after all I could do for the edge it wasn't happening.
2,Looks great but is really dull,Ordered it was very DULL couldn't cut jello with this let alone shave with it. Unless you know how to sharpen it don't get it. On another note though it looks really nice.
2,"okay, not the best","Not the best chocolates, really nothing special. Did like the green tea one a lot, but the rest were mediocre. Would rather have hersheys pot of gold, which are much less expensive and taste better..."
4,Classic Thrash/Grind!,"Wehrmacht, one of the most overlooked pioneers of the early grind scene (in this era, bands such as SOD and Wehrmacht were hailed as thrash/hardcore or thrashcore), gained a great deal of credibilty with their second album Beirmacht. The album consists of some of the groups greatest outings such as ""GoreFlix"", ""Night Of Pain (Part 2)"", and ""Radical Neck Dissection""!This Y2K New Renaissance re-release contains a few packaging/tracking flaws that are worthy of note. The inlay and booklet both have incorrect track listings, for example. It also lacks production notes or any additional commentaries, thanks lists, etc. that other reprinting labels such as NMG have. Regardless, Biermacht is still a mandatory own, and hopefully, Shark Attack (Wehrmacht's best album and one of the greatest metal releases of all time) will be re-released soon.-l-"
1,"Great Music, Not a real CD","This so-called Enhanced CD has software that automatically installs into your computer. Apparently, this is to prevent illicit copying of the music. However, this is a great way to introduce security holes in your OS. It's tough to be an informed consumer when you're not given all the relevant information before you buy. The company I work for prohibits using such CDs in the company computers. So, I had to buy a separate CD player in order to listen to the music at work. This software is the kind of rudeness that's the antithesis of The Beat's music."
1,this movie is out of date and is a complete mock of p. ball,"Ok heres the deal this movie was very boring it was not up to date and does not show any electronic guns. If you are a beginner paintball player or a pro this movie is not for you. But if you would like information on tactics,guns, and helpful hints INSTANT MESSAGE ME ON AMERICA ONLINE @ Usmellripe@aol.com Or feel free to right and e-mail @ usmellripe@aol.com DaMtMasta@aol.com\overall a waste of money"
1,Whoops! It's blank,"Well I ordered this for my granddaughter as she loves Olivia. To my surprise (thanks to ordering in hurry I guess) I received it today and discovered it is a BLANK BOOK. This is not the story, it is just a journal. A four-year-old would not want it. This is just to warn otheres to read what it is you are ordering so no one else is disappointed. Now I have to return and re-order."
3,Cute,"Yes, Olivia is irrepressible. Yes, the story is fun and the illustrations are hilarious. Yes, our daughter likes this book. But it doesn't quite measure up to the original. The original Olivia story is truly a classic and while this book is good, start with the one that introduced us to this very lovable and typical young child, er, pig."
2,Lying is okay?,"The book is funny, but it advocates lying. It makes lying 'cute' and does not explain the consequences of lying. I will not want my daughter to read it and think that lying done right is acceptable."
3,I love the Character and Book,Wonderful book and author however condition of my book was all of pages fell out but what can you expcet when it was only a penny!
2,Weak chain link,"Would not buy this again. My smaller dog was able to get the flimsy (too short) metal ties off of the frame. She then easily mashed the chain link and escaped. I cannot get the chain link to smooth out again. It took hours to put together, not 30 minutes as promised. This crate would never hold a medium-large strong dog. It is free standing and my dogs pushed it across the basement room, tipped it and escaped."
4,Get it new,"An earlier ""compatible"" didn't last. It pays to get the item new in the OEM packaging rather than refurbished. This is good right out to the box, the refurbished never had the print quality of the new."
2,A Big Dissapointment,"In the past, I have jumped at the chance to get any book by Virginia Henley. Her books were filled with bold, intellegent, sexy women and strong, powerful well defined males. The stories have captivated me that I couldn't put the books down until I was finished. Stories like, Tempted, Enslaved, The Hawk and The Dove have been excellant. In reading A Woman Of Passion, I am very dissapointed. In fact, Bess, the main character, lacks passion. The last two book written by Virginia, has lacked the exciting, sensual style that she has had in the past. She has been one of my favorite writers and I hope she starts writing again in the style that I have come to love. A Woman of Passion, lacks the passion that has been known for books by Virginia Henley."
3,Overall an Okay read,"Bess of Hardwick is six year old when she is forced from her home and on that day vows that she will get it back. Good luck smile on Bess and she is given a chance to go the court of Henry VIII. While there she meets Lady Elizabeth and good fortune turns for the better. Though three marriages she ends up as the Countness of Shrewsberry.""A Woman of Passion"" was a decent by Virginia Henly but I have to say that I found the book to be longer read than it really needed. And I coundn't find Bess to a character that could really relate too."
4,Money's Worth,"I haven't had this watch for very long, but i can definitely say I am very pleased with it so far. I bought the watch for camping/hiking and other times when i don't have (or want) my phone around. I just wanted a simple sporty watch that told time. The fact that it had a DATE indicator was a plus. It is extremely lightweight. I actually thought the box was empty when i got it. I have a couple of camping and hiking trips coming up so i will definitely put the durability, of the lightweight resin case, to the test. The Indiglo light works great and the dials/numbers are very easy to read when it's pitch black out."
4,Durable,"El reloj es simple pero cumple completamente su función: es de fácil lectura, liviano, resistente y durable. Ha sido mi reloj de uso diario por mas de dos años, soy ingeniero constructor y trabajo en un clima cálido, húmedo tropical; por tanto el reloj ha soportado de todo: humedad, hongos, bacterias, polvo, sol,lluvia etc. y esta en perfectas condiciones. No le doy las 5 estrellas porque como dicen mis antecesores la pulsera es de nailon y los fabricantes para evitar que se deshile en los cortes queman la tela y esas partes quemadas hacen irritar un poco la piel, pero por lo demás la pulsera es las mas resientes que he probado, solo hay que sumergir el reloj en algún bactericida de ves en cuando para que no tome mal olor ya que la pulsera atrapa suciedad entre la trama de la tela de nailon."
5,this DVD delivers,"I'll just chime in with all the above.For me, as a novice, watching the band and picking up on their cueshas been most helpfull"
1,Defective?,Either our disc was defective or it's just a bad product. We couldn't click on all menu items.We didn't even complain and try to get a replacement because it didn't interest my 8 year old and he was a big KFP fan. This is the only Kinnect game he hasn't liked yet.
3,Not what I thought,"I thought I was ordering Kung Fu Panda II ... was surprised when it arrived. It is what I ordered, but not what I thought I was ordering."
4,Kung Fu Panda Movie,"My husband and I took my nieces to see this movie in the theater and loved it. My nephew missed the theater outting, but couldn't wait to watch it after Santa brought him the DVD.A very entertaining and educational movie...but I'm a Jack Black Fan, which doesn't hurt. Enjoy!"
2,Great Movie but CD quality not so good,I got this CD for my daugther who is 3 years old. She loved the movie but after playing a few times the CD got about 2-3 minor scratches. Then the movie would not play so well. I have other CD's for her and since she's young she likes to take her CD's out herself from the player and ets most of them scratched. Some of her CD's still play so well but this one after just 2-3 minor scratches started giving me problems.The movie is very good though. The CD quality is what i think could have been better like a CD with scratch resistant surface or something....
5,Stupendous,"I ordered this DVD for my grandson who lives in Virginia (I live in Mexico). It arrived on a very timely basis, and he watches very often (he is four).Thanks, AmazonKay Martin"
3,Everybody was Kung Fu fighting.,"The product arrived in a timely fashion and fully in tact. The quality of the DVD was as expected, brand new, without flaws. My three year old son enjoys watching this cartoon and showing the video case to me to get my attention."
3,It's Okay. There are some funny scenes and some good messages.,"It's Okay. There are some funny scenes and some good messages such as ""Pursuit your dream. Do what you like. To teach somebody effectively, you have to know what he likes"". Panda loved food. His master found out he had to use food during the training to improve Panda's learning pace."
2,Kung Fu Panda dvd,"the DVD stops at a certain spot in the movie, we need to fast forward that part then the rest works fine. Guess that's what you get for a low price!"
5,Love this movie!!,"It was in great condition when it was delivered. I watched it right after I received it, without any problems :)The movie itself is also great, even for adults to watch."
5,"Milkbone, BOOTY CRUNCH!","This Cd rocks! Was glad to see these cats live, ONCE! There's a line in a song that talks about redecoratin' the White House in Magenta, patchwork quilts, and lava lamps! Sounds like what I'd hope Obama might do! ROCK ON! And coming up on you left we have the Lincon Memorial. Has a strikin' resem to Jimi Hendrix under these strobe lights, wouldn't ya say?!? Love FFN, you will too!"
5,One of the Best Albums Ever,Seriously. The record company screwed the pooch. Someday David Ryan Harris will be recognized as one of the greatest artists of his day.
1,Follow For Now,"It would have been great, if this album cover art matched what I bought. Instead of getting Follow For Now's debut album, I was sent a radio promo single. lol..What a joke."
5,"Great Quality, Hard to find!",Long ball end allen sockets are hard to find for a decent price. These are typical high quality gearwrench brand tools. I highly recommend!
3,Great product-bad packaging,"I like the product and the price was great for the value, but what I didn't appreciate, is that all of the sticks advanced themselves and I could not turn them back down. So now I am stuck with using a stick that is stuck out long and will not dial back down so I can use it more efficiently and neatly. That is a drag. But I still like the product. I may just have to find a store that sells it instead of purchasing it on line. That way I can take it back when this happens again."
1,Complete Disappointment,"I first heard about this product after watching a music video on Youtube. The video inspired me to read about the hair stylist who did all of the hair for the video. He mentioned that he used this product. I then saw that Sharon Stone swore by the product as well.When I received it, I was so excited to begin using it. The product looks like deodorant and is just as solid and hard. I was basically unable to smooth the product onto my hair because of it's hard, solid nature. It smells wonderful, but the consistency made it impossible for me to use."
5,Great pocket knife,"Very sharp , speedsafe opening is wicked fast rough handle makes a sure grip even when damp. a great purchase"
2,Razor sharp but uncomfortable to carry,"This knife does everything advertised, however the design of the thumb stud makes it very uncomfortable to carry in the front pocket. It has a fairly sharp edge, so that every time you reach into your pocket, it rubs against your hand. I've had many other knives with thumb studs (I usually carry a Benchmade 942)and have never had this problem."
1,Had to return,"Bought this knife, I needed to send my EDC Benchmade 940 in to be sharpened after a year of hard use.Really liked the Blur out of the box, sharp blade, nice weight, felt good. Then I tried to use it in at work like I do my Benchamde. Cuts open boxes great, slices up cardboard fine. I tried to cut some plastic banding off a pallet of boxes, it FOLDED OVER ALL THE SERRATED TEETH! Not sure if it was a bad heat treating on the blade or what, but returned it. Ordered an Emerson CQC7!Will never buy another cheap knife again!"
3,"Nice design, except for the blade","The Kershaw Blur is a great knife that really is super-fast to open. Fits great in the hand, slim in the pocket, solidly built. My only quibble is the spring clip is on the wrong end for my taste and requires a Torx T6 bit to change (most kits only go down to T8). The steel is good but not great; comes very sharp but requires a fair amount of maintenance to keep it that way.This knife comes with a fake Tanto design that doesn't really have a stronger tip nor does it have the good curve of a drop point. That corner on the cutting edge interferes with slicing and is the first thing that dulls. After about an hour of careful sharpening, I removed the corner and now have a more functional knife."
4,A Definite Re-Read,"When I borrowed this book from a friend's younger sister, I thought it would be an easy read to take my mind off things before I did my homework. Well, I read it.. and then I read it again. While the plot could be a little contrived at times, the characters were vivid and real, and the relationships between them left me wishing for a sequel. I bought the book for myself, and it has a permanent place on my bookshelf for those rainy lonely days when I need some cheering up."
2,All critics agree...or do they?,This book was confusing to me. The book is definetely science fiction with events such as a nuclear catastrophe wiping out almost all of the cities in the United States and the mississippi river being a toxic wasteland.The title isnt too appetizing either. It is also hard to get to know what the characters are really like.
2,Eek...,"I guess she's pretty, and her lyrics are thoughtful, but bottom line- she can't sing. But she gets one star for her lyrics. Everything that other singers have believed in, the whole ""ok-sing-from-your-diaphram-blah"" is not respected. Her voice is...interesting, the sort of high-pitched softness that M2M brings out in their first album except worse. If she sang normally she might have some hope, but if you are a believer in the classic way of breathing (lol) she will probably not be your choice. Or if you are not tolerant of anything other than American Pop. Also, if you are an aspiring singer, don't listen to her. Your dreams will be shattered."
1,the chipmunks meet the munchkins,"that is the only way i see to describe this girls voice...i can't see how some people say she can sing!!! they are obviously immune to the high, squeaky, chipmunk-esque tone of her voice. and yes, i have heard all the songs, and i admit, the beats are quiet catchy, its just...you wonder what possessed this chica to sing along...my cat can sing better than her, and i don't have a cat...you do the math. if there was a no-star option, i would give it to this cd, and all her other offerings...if i were you, i would go up to the search bar, and type in two words: Hikaru Utada. this is someone who CAN sing!!!"
2,Clear communication? Give me a break!,"As a fifth-year journalism student, I would expect to find a certain degree of professionalism in this book. However, after having taken a course which used this book, I was rather disappointed with the book's content. Instead of presenting the subject matter in a clear and concise manner, the author instead attempts to impress readers with his use of ""cutesy"" words and expressions. The author appears to be trying to have fun, but he only creates more of a chore for his readers by taking this approach. If you want to learn how to edit professionally, I'd recommend finding another book. In fact, see _Contemporary Editing_ by Friend, Challenger and McAdams, which also has a very helpful and user-friendly workbook."
1,great show but really boring season!,this is one of my favorite shows but this season was the worst. and the most boring.and stupid storyline. why would they turn willow bad? worst storyline and worst season
5,Excellent!,"This collection (the ""six-disc collector's edition"") is far superior to the previously-released ""four-disc incompletist's edition."" I don't even know why I bought that piece of junk. Nothing made sense. Like all of a sudden Tara just stopped being in the show. Next thing I know, everybody's singing. And the director's commentary mostly consisted of sentence fragments."
2,"Not bad, seen better","Exept for 1 or 2 episodes,the rest seem awkward. off character. I liked Willow facing her ""darkside"" but I was really disappointed by Spike. Not the actor who was really good as usual. Why giving him back his soul... been there done that! it would have been nice to see what would have reallly append if he didnt had this BLOODY chip. Why bring Anya and Xander together to break their mariage, even before it started. Again it would of been nice to see a couple working for once. Where is your humour. What I liked in the 5 season before was that they where laughing at themself. This one is realy dark.Hope the seventh season will be better"
2,what is everyone talking about?,ok i just bought season six(but ive already seen all the eps)and everyone has their own opinion but this season kinda sucks. But i am basing this on one thing: spike and buffy relatioship! the two characters i once loved i cant stand! they are so bitter! anyways a good season for all the other characters especially willow. besides for spike and buffy its watchable.
4,"way to go, buffy!","I loved this season very much! The Buffy and Spike relationship was my favourite...of course that is slightly biased since I've wanted those two together since ""something blue"" in season 4. Besides that, however, the other storylines were strong and I loved them just as much. PICK THIS SEASON UP!"
2,Buffy Great! DVD Manufacturer Bad,"Well, maybe I souldn't really be writing a review, as the 4 times I had to order this set through Amazon only to find that disc 2 was either a0 not included, or b) so poorly manufactured that it didn't play ay all. I really wanted to watch the seires in order, but I went ahead and watched what I could. Pretty dull season, but then again, early on it was rumored to be the last season. So now as I wait for my 5th replacement, I hope disc to brings some life to a forgetable series that was as forgetable as the character Tara."
5,WHAT can I say?!,"I don't know if I could have a favorite season of this show, because I think it all completely works together and one big whole amazing masterpiece. This is my favorite show my far, and I think season 6 is really interesting as Willow is 'poisoned' by dark magick, as she becomes the villian of the season which is totally unexpectant and interesting as hell since shes sweet innocent Willow gone all wrong.I think that 'Once More With Feeling' was such a great episode because it was so different and it had so much meaning and WHO could deny Anthony Stewart Head's voice!Joss Whedon is a genius!It's depressing that the Series is over.. why couldn't it have been 10 seasons as opposed to just 7?? :P"
1,Frustrating Read Aloud Stories,"My children like the Thomas the Tank Engine series. However, I have to agree with the other reviewer that commented on the disjointed stories. It is very frustrating reading all of these stories as one sentence doesn't flow into the next sentence. I am constantly backing up and rereading the sentences to make sense of the stories. The kids like the pictures, so half the time I make up a story to go along with the pictures."
3,Kind of fragmented.,"The stories are good stories,the pictures are neat, andthe characters are interesting.This book, though, tends to be writtenin a sort of fragmentary style,leaving out a bit much, and oftennot giving a good idea of why onepicture follows another.On the other hand, my 3-year-old likesit, like all her other Thomas books."
5,Fantastic Movie,"We first saw this movie when we were stationed in the UK on the BBC - this was over 7 years ago! I've been hoping that it would come out on dvd and I can't wait to add it to our collection! Really cute comedy - fun, fun movie! Highly recommend!!!!!"
5,Fantastic!!!,"We had been looking for this movie, not knowing the name for years. Finally, found out the name and ""wowla"" here it is. My husband just loves this movie and I am glad I found it. Thanks!!!"
5,Great classic movie,"A timeless classic that offers good entertainment along with family values and superb acting. Common attributes that most of the classic films share is excellent casting from top to bottom, great scripts and tight directing. It Happened on 5th Avenue has them all. I never get tired of it!"
2,"Ultimately, Disappointed in a Shipping Error","Everything seemed to go really well - the order was smooth, the delivery came on time, and, I thought that I had received the movie that I wanted for a Christmas gift. However, when opened, the wrong DVD disc was inside the package. I had planned a movie night to share the classic film and was disappointed to have to cancel it.Now, I am in the process of a returning the item.So far, the company is responding well. I am sure they will ""make good"" on the ""error""; it was just a bit of a let-down. Hopefully, I will either get the correct movie, or, a full refund ."
5,"very cute, upbeat movie","After looking for this movie for years I finally found it on VHS. Today I was going through my movies & realized that it is missing. I see that it is now on DVD so I am buying it immediatly. For those who were critical of it, all I can say is to go back to watching the RAMBO movies.R.G. Hooper"
5,classic,"Great old movie about priorities, we loved it this holiday season. It puts into perspective the value of friends and the simple things in love over the accumulation of wealth and power. The happiest times often are the times we have the least possessions."
4,Fun old film,This has a great cast of old time character actors with some decent material. Not really a Christmas movie but is based around the time of the holidays.
3,Lovely and Light,"This is a lovely and innocent old time movie about an improbable story of a homeless person who moves from one grand house to another as the owners go away for the season. While it was enjoyable for one viewing, I do not feel the need to see it again."
4,Saturday Night Live of smut,"The commercials of swinger clubs with phone numbers blanked out (of course they aren't open anymore) are sometimes funny. One is a joke where Al Goldstein tells us what we can do after death. I will admit the best part interviews Bambi Woods from Debbie Does Dallas. If you can find anyplace else where she was ever interviewed in person, than you are the rare one who wouldn't find this worth the price of the whole DVD. Forwardable is the Vera Knotty interview where she peforms the stunt that gave her that name.. yuck!"
3,Why I took it back.,I bought the camcorder after my Jvc was destroyed in an accident. I really enjoyed my Jvc but the sony was much better. I did finally take it (the pc100) back because I found out on the Sony website that sony was coming out with a dcr pc 110. It has a U.S.B. connection which means I'll be able to download stills much faster. The still pictures in the pc100 come out very dark .The pictures were great if you were outside.We end up buying a flash but then the subjects of the pictures looked like deer in headlights.The video was superb. Keep in mind the pc110 is quite a bit more expensive. If you can do without great looking stills consider the pc100.The software for pc110 is also better and did I mention the movie mode? You decide.
2,"Keep you fingers crossed, never drop it on the floor.","Overall speaking, good camera. But, it will cost you a fortune (US$880) to repair it, if you drop it on the floor.I was also planing to use on my Dell computer as a WebCam via the firewire port. No, it didn't and doesn't work. After being pushed back and forth like a pingpong ball by Sony and Dell, final explaination was that this camcorder could not be used as a webcam through the firewire. If I insist on using it as a webcam, I need to install a vedio capturing card in my Dell computer in order to get the vedio feed from the RCA output of the Camcoder.Somebody mentioned battery can last 6+ hours recording. I would be really really happy if I can get one quarter of that. Don't hold you expection that high."
3,Problem with still pictures,"I bought a DCR-PC100E in July 2000. Generally, I am satisfied with it, but I have a problem with making still pictures as follow: I make still pictures in the best quality (1152 x 768, Superfine). When I see the still pictures they are all made with the big sharpenning of edges. If I make a details of some object (faces etc) I can be satisfied for 60%. But if there are many small objects on the still pictures, I don't be satisfied at all, because I see ""Edges"" on many small objects and the picture is very bad. The sharpenning of edges is a problem of software for DCR-PC100E. My question: Can I eliminate this sharpenning of edges ? Or Is there a FIRMWARE for this Camcoder to eliminate this sharpenning. I can make a sharpenning with some software after making a picture and I don't understand why SONY incorporate a software with it. Thanks to help me."
5,Very good quality,"very good quality and got here fast, i wear this every day and it isn't stretching the holes in my belt like my last belt buckle did"
4,"Copperhead mouse, not finger friendly for long times","A really nice mouse. It was this one or the G5. I wish that I could have tried the G5 to see how it would fit my hand. This one is nice, but there is no rest places for you fingers. Not good for long gaming times. Other than that It perfoms great. I love how the settings are saved on the mouse so it can be taken to other computers without the software."
2,Functional but uncomfortable,"This precision mouse technically works as advertised. However, the scroll buttons on the left side of the mouse and the cursor speed controls on the right side of the mouse are in a hard to get at position. Part of the problem could be the size of my hand which is large. But even so, the buttons mentioned above are positioned under a ridge on both sides of the mouse. Additionally, the buttons are too far toward the palm of the hand thereby requiring the fingers to reach under and toward the body to reach the control buttons which is an unnatural action.This could be an excellent product if the ergonomics is changed, but as is it is much inferior to others mice which are available.I am very disappointed in this product"
2,Why did I buy these things?,"I am a sucker for a sale. I have not used any of these things once. Maybe if I didn't have access to a kitchen they would be handy. I would have used them in a dorm or someplace with a plug and no stove top. Somebody must love these things.Just the thought of running the fat away from a juicy hamburger has made George Foreman a wealthy, wealthy man. So if you are a big meat eater...I must recommend one."
5,understanding,"When I read this book, it helped me understand how a soldier's mind works...what is going on in it during specific times, how they process it and then deal with it. Having 3 in my immediate family, this was very powerful to me.American Mourning: The Intimate Story of Two Families Joined by War, Torn by BeliefsAmerican Heroes: Stories of Faith, Courage, and Sacrifice from the Front LinesTo read more about my 3 men, try out either one of these other two books."
4,Worthy of the bucks,"If this album is a single only consisting of ""Don't cry for me, Argentina"", it still deserves the money. However, it is not a perfect album, which is worse than ""I do not want what I haven't got"" and ""Lion and Cobra""."
1,IF NOT FOR THE BIG BAND CHARTS...,"SOME OF WHICH WERE PENNED BY THE HIGHLY UNDER-RATED PATRICK WILLIAMS,AND PERFORMED TO PERFECTION BY A GREAT ALL-STAR PACK OF MUSICIANS (WHOIGNORED THE LACKLUSTER SINGER THEY WERE BEING PAID--WELL, I HOPE--TOACCOMPANY), I WOULD CERTAINLY NOT HAVE HELD ON TO THIS ALBUM PAST THEUNCOMFORTABLE FIRST HALF-CHORUS OF THE FIRST SONG.""The Great American Songbook"" is clearly not a genre of musicto mess with unless the singer has the chops to do it justice. Clearly,Ms. O'Connor--despite all of her other successes--does NOT.But, hey! if Phil Ramone wanted to produce something that wouldbring in some crossover-audience bucks, and didn't care how materialisticit made him look... why should anyone care?By the way, the one star was for the skilled arranger(s), theconductor(Torrie Zito), and the players. I WOULD have given themfive big ones, but didn't want it to look like it was for the mis-placed and underwhelming skills of Ms. O'Connor."
2,Not Subversive Enough,"Sinead O'Connor is a great vocalist. Forget, for a moment, all the publicity that ended up destroying her career (aside for the few remaining diehards) and think back to the first time you heard that voice. That voice. The one that gave you goosebumps on ""The Lion and the Cobra"" or brought you to tears on ""I Do Not Want What I Have Not Got."" Then, imagine it singing a batch of show tunes. Intriguing idea? Absolutely. Unfortunately there isn't enough attitude here.What this ends of being is a straight forward collection of these songs, which might be great for Barbara Striesand, but for Sinead we expect more. We expect a certain subversion and, sadly, we don't get it here. Oh the voice is still there, but the passion isn't. Diehards may like it, but then again by the time this was released, they were the only ones still listening."
3,noisy,"Its a very gentle massage, which feels good, but I would have prefered something firmer. The kneeding setting is also very noisy, and sounds a bit like a breathing machine at the hospital, so makes me feel a bit geriatric when I use it.Its good with the calves but unless you have large feet (I'm a women's size 7.5), you wont really get much but a light vibration for your feet, as all the kneeding motion is on the sides."
1,don't buy it,"We bought one, the roller in the one side snapped off. We returned it and got another one. Now the exact same thing happened. The roller in the one side snapped off. The person using it is a 77 year old man, so it isn't like he is being rough with it or has muscular legs. The massager has a defect. I am fighting for my money back now. Amazon says it is past the 30 days for a refund."
2,COULD BE BETTER,This tape does teach you some words and phrases but not at all enought to carry a real conversation.
4,rare Puccini,"I had preordered this DVD and, having read the other reviews approached watching it with dread. Expecting nothing, I was pleasantly surprised. If you are looking at this, then you are interested in seeing what Puccini's first opera looks like, and this DVD will give you that experience. The vast majority of the works interest lies in the music written for the men, chorus, or orchestra alone. All are at least adequate. The story is silly (even for opera) but does not overstay its welcome as the DVD last just over an hour. This is a live performance. At times the audience applauded what was going on on stage. Their applause seemed appropriate."
4,underrated power pop!,"much better than the mediocre american greatest hits, this covers the boys up to 88, offering their unique combination of harmonies, harmonica, horns and heavy metal guitar. A good time c.d. that will make any white boy tap his toes and snap his fingers..."
2,Boring,I bought this with intent of learning the basics of massage. I didnt expect to have to sit thru a complete fmassage. You know you can discribe the process of each point of the body and move on. I dont need to see the rest of the five or ten minutes of the process without not a word being said
1,poorly made,made for infants or 2 to 3 yea olds. very poorly made. buy leapfrog instead. it's a waste of money.
4,Meet The Letters Video,This is a wonderful learning video for the alphabet. I bought it as a gift or my niece and she loves watching it and has learned many of her letters already!
3,Not exactly what I was expecting.,As a kindergarten teacher I'm always looking for materials that will grab my students attention and keep them engaged. This series of videos did not. After about 5 minutes they were extremely bored with it. It's good for my younger children at home but not entertaining enough to hold the attention of 5 year olds. The font is also ball and stick and does not come in D'nealian font. I would have also liked for the video to give you each letters sounds but it does not.
2,"Nothing scary, nothing special","Categorized as horror -- there is almost no horror -- but that was deliberate. Set in a girl's school where a loose diary draws a girl into the vortex of mysterious deaths, a lesbian relationship and psychic happenings. Potentially a good drama -- in the first half. By the end, I found it confusing and empty."
3,Good game ... but needs some polishing!,"A few too many bugs and I'm having difficulty porting my saved files over to a re-install. This is a great start to a ""real"" franchise mode, but it plays more like a concept than a fully tested game.I've played it 40+ hours and will keep going, but I think it's just holding me over until Madden 07 comes out."
4,Good out of the box. Better with some 3rd party addons.,"This game is only for true strategy fans. There is no finger twitching action. If you take your time on and enjoy the postseason on Madden, you will probably like this game. If you skip all that, skip this game to. One glaring omission from this game out of the box was a lack of ability to modify difficulty and game lengths. A quick search on the web will provide you an addon that opens these options and many more. This vastly improves the ability to customize the gameplay to better suit your style. I do like this game and see potential for longterm playability."
1,Major flaw,"The instruction of pronunciation is wrong, especially with single vs double consonants. The instances that comes to my mind are r/rr and z/zz. With the r/rr, they pronounce ""caro"" and ""carro"" the same way, with the trilled sound. In reality ""carro"" has the trill whereas ""caro"" does not. The ""r"" in ""caro"" is pronounced more like the ""dd"" in the English word ""ladder"".The other single/double consonants also taught incorrectly are ""z/zz"". A single ""z"" in Italian has a ""d"" sound in front of it, like in ""ad zone"". The ""zz"" is taught to sound the same as the single ""z"" when in reality it has a ""ts"" sounds like in ""hits"" or ""ritz"".Even though I'm from an Italian-American family, I know minimal Italian but enough to know how letters are pronounced. Personally, I wouldn't waste my money with this DVD."
2,Big disappointment.,"We bought this DVD based on the idea that it would be an easy and fun way to learn conversational Italian. Big bummer! We watched over 1/2 an hour and at the end of the time didn't know a single word in Italian -- but we COULD tell you which letters are not innate to the Italian alphabet.Too much focus on the finer points of the language (the aforementioned alphabet issue as well as long, drawn-out sections on the difference in pronunciation of various vowels but no context in which to place them) and not enough on the nuts and bolts, like ""Where's the bathroom?"" ""How much does that cost?"" or even, ""Do you speak English, please?""Also, I found the constant change of narrator to be quite confusing and even irritating.A good idea -- to make learning another language fun -- but it somehow got lost in translation (pun intended!). It doesn't make a difference if the tape is entertaining if it doesn't teach you anything of use!"
2,Too thin,"The socks are simply too thin. They are great the first time out, but quickly (after only 3 - 5 uses) wear out and are unacceptably thin. I will not be buying them again."
5,Crew socks,"Really comfortable socks. My brother has nike crew and those are not as nice. They are really long, go up to 3/4 my shin when stretched( im 5-9) but you can always just slid them down and they'll still look nice. I wear them to tennis and to school and they work well for both."
2,Too Small,"I""m the mother of three ""big"" men with ""big"" feet and cannot find sock sizes 14-16, or even 12-16. What do other ""big-footed"" men do for socks??? HELP."
1,TENNESSEE ATLAS & GAZETTEER,This is not in as much detail as I expected and is just another map-I wish to return it-how do I do that ?
3,Works good but doesn't hold up too well,I bought this to go with Barr's Citristrip which works great. The scraping tool worked well at first but after a while the edge started to wear out. For a large project you will probably need more than one of these.
4,Why Do They Do This?,"This was a collection that was great but it fell in the parts that matter most: the beginning, middle, and end mainly the end. There is probably not enough here to recommend it to those who generally avoid harem comedies, or more accurately there is enough to turn them away, however those who do enjoy harem comedies, or is an true anime lover like me would probably do well to check this show out."
5,"Alvin ""bass Binz"" McCoy","This a good LP of Kid Sensation flex between the fast bassed out music that he is known for producing. This CD is also great for for parting to in the summer, even one of the remixes he does is tight. A good slow flow with tight beats."
3,The Blues Night,"I recently bought ""The Blues Night"" to complete a 4 set of CD's. 2 were Kaiser/Mansfield projects. The 3rd CD also included Howard. The music contained in this CD is generally good with the exception of the 3 songs that Tracy Balin was involved with. Sometimes known artists help lesser known artists and give them a chance to show their stuff. I give this recording a 3 1/2 + out of 5 stars. This CD went out-of-print a short time after it was originally released from what I understand."
5,Full of heart...There is nothing else to say...!!!,"This is an emotionally moving piece of art, which is full of heart and true passion...For those of you who think otherwise, perhaps true art is not for you. There is nothing else to say...This work will uplift your spirit!!!!"
1,Burned out screen,"I have had this unit for several months and has worked fine. The mapping and re-routing is fairly reasonable and accurate.On a trip to Boston from Maryland, after 4 hour of use, the screen went blank. The unit was on the windshield mount. When I took it down I notice the unit was hot and would not turn back on.I have tried to contact Fine Digital USA for several weeks, via phone, the mail box is full and can not receive any more calls is on the answering machine.I have sent several emails to them as well.I guess there should have been a warning not to use this for more than several hours.Very unhappy with lack of customers service."
1,RealDrive Out of Business,"I purchased the RealDrive 400 in December of 2006, in early August it just stopped working. I've tried to reach RealDrive, it has a one year warranty, but their phone number has a message that the voice mail is full and does not take messages. I've emailed them ten time, written letters to them, and an email and letter to Amazon....nothing....I finally got an email from a former distributor, and was told the company had gone under..............it's a great product when it works, but now I'm out of luck....do not waste your money."
5,Love this Product,Very pleased with this product. Could not get around our new town without it. Loved the price.
5,DO NOT BUY...DOESNT LAST A YEAR AND NO CUST SERVICE,"I purchased this 12/06...its now 10/06...it doesnt work...it appears to not be communicating with the sattelites.....finedigital has a very nice website but I got no response to emails I sent....they have a phone number, but all I get is a recording that the mailbox is full and you cant leave a message.....it has a one yr manufacturers warranty but I cant reach them to uphold it.....WHAT A WASTE OF MONEY!!!!!! (i loved it while it was working, user friendly and nice big screen)"
2,Review from a 10 year old,"I really enjoyed the book so I was excited to see it was made into a movie. Unfortunately, the movie is not near as good as the book. The movie was confusing at points and sometimes even silly. The book was much better. I'm glad we decided to rent it first."
4,Fun for kids-BUT paint doesn't come off clothing,"My kids love it and it keeps them busy, but it is messy! It does splatter a bit and it DOES NOT come off of clothing. I can't believe they would make any kid toy without using washable paints????"
4,Great answer to a problem,We needed an art spinner for our Sunday School kick-off party. This one fit the bill perfectly. It's hard to get the pictures off the spinner without making a mess and it's hard to clean but all the services that Amazon and its seller provided were satisfactory.
5,Beefy,"While I can't speak to the ease of obtaining additional cardstock to play with, I love this spinner.About a year and a half ago, now, my band used this machine to create five hundred seperate pieces of spin-art for a project we were doing. We were using our own materials (CD inserts and acrylic paint from a craft store), and this little guy held up.Due to the number of pieces we were making, we fully expected to have to buy three or four of these, but the thing's a work-horse! Not only did it work just fine, but I never even had to replace the batteries!Completely pleased! Honestly, I can't imagine any child giving this spinner more abuse than we did, so buy in confidence!"
3,"Kind of neat, but short lived fun","My kids had a bit of fun with this. This splash guard mostly containded the mess, which is good.It was kind of difficult for my kids (6 and 8) to squeeze out only a few drops at a time so a fair amount of the paint ended up spinning right off the paper and wasted in the tray. But there was still plenty of paint to fill the cards that it came with. It came with some white papers and some black. This seemed like a good idea. The colors barely showed up on the black paper though and even the white ones where not nearly as bright as in the picture."
4,Great sounding budget HTIB,"I've now had this system running in my home theater for about 2-3 year. Its sound is incredibly clear and has plenty of bass. The one thing I would change about it, is the volume. It seems to be a bit underpowered, but since I live in a townhouse and don't want to bother my neighbors, it's plenty loud for my current needs. I have my Playstation, DVR, and media center pc all connected to it and it is connected to the TV. This way everything runs through a single device to the TV."
3,Decent HT for the money,"Not a bad deal considering that it is SONY. I expected the sound to be a bit louder, there's no coax TV input. Otherwise it is a decent piece of equipment for $300 with shipment. If you need better - pay more."
4,Great For The Money,"Was easy to install. has more i/o ports than others in it's price range.controller is very easy esp when the componets are sony.if not sony it might or might not be in the booklet,easy self calabration.Just remember it had no dvd player"
4,Good Budget System,"This system works better than I expected. It sounds great! The auto calibration feature is nice. Makes it much easier to setup. I only had to tweak the settings a little bit afterwards. The ability to rename the inputs is also nice, as you can't always use the inputs for what they are labeled for originally. I am definately happy with this purchase."
4,strong mat/rug,"this mat can be used as either a mat or bathroom rug, or both. It is not a soft, plush sort of mat. Rather, it's a strong, woven medium sized oval shaped product that ought to last for many years. One side does seem a bit softer but as I said, this is not a foft product. the yellow color is great. We really like this bathroom mat/rug. Hope this helps."
3,Organic gardening?,"This has been advertised as ""gone organic"". I'ts exactly the same, even pictures/sketches as the original, except for a very small section on beneficial insects in the back, a few of the more dangerous chemicals are deleted, and the whole houseplant section is gone. I have the old version, and I like it much better. If you have the old one, keep it. The ""upgrade"" is not worth the money. You'd be better off getting a ""companion"" book to go along with the original, such as Organic Gardening by Geoff Hamilton, which also has beautiful real photographs."
2,Classically Boring,"One thing I love about my Kindle and rise of the e-books is that so many classics are free. Otherwise, I never would have bought this book. Actually, I never even heard of it. The freeness made it very appealing.It is about a suburb of London where three families converge. The three have a variety of problems that only seem to happen in Victorian England--bad brother who scams family members for money and then does a physical attack for revenge, the 'new' game of tennis, the launch of women's rights, and other issues that is so ""England"".It was a cute and short story but not one I would ever want to pay for! If you're reading the classics, stick with other English authors and if you want Doyle, then stick with his Holmes stories. Cute, but that's about it."
4,Movie is great...BUT NO DIGITAL COPY!?!,"I LOVE the movie and the bonus features, but I'm a bit upset that there is no digital copy for my portable devices. I think ALL BLU-RAYs should come with a digital copy!"
4,One of the better comic-book hero...,...sagas made for the big screen. Robert Downey Jr. does a surprisingly good job in this role. The plot is believable and the special effects are very well crafted into the story. A good movie all-around.
5,IronClad!,"This is an ironclad winner! Good plot excellent special effects - guaranteed to entertain.Part of the Avengers super-hero group, Ironman and Captain America are two best ""singles"" of the series."
4,4.99,"This is almost a perfect super hero film. It looks beautiful on Blu-ray and sounds incredible. In only a few moments the movie gets rolling and never lets up. Mixing action with a pretty good storyline to get any non-comics reader up to snuff on Iron Man history, this movie really does a good job. Not overly gory and mild language make this movie okay for teenagers. One quick sex scene without any nudity does make this a parental decision for anyone with younger kids. After Fantastic Four I was really surprised by the quality of this film."
4,The Best Superhero Movie So Far!,"I've heard--and read--so many disparaging remarks regarding superhero movies, as if they're somehow inferior to ""real"" movies--what is a REAL movie, anyway? A low-budget indie full of miserable people? I think the characterization in Iron Man, like the Spider-Man franchise, is very good. Robert Downey Jr. IS Tony Stark/Iron Man. No one else could have brought this character to life as he has. The supporting cast is excellent. The story is true to the comic book--or is it ""graphic novel"" now? I'm never quite sure! The story never bogs down. The special effects are spectacular. Marvel was wise to take the reins on this one.I only gave it four stars instead of five because I was disappointed to find, in all the extras included in the 2-disc set, there was no BLOOPER REEL!!!!"
2,Horrible; best scenes cut and labeled 'extended/deleted',Some the best and in-depth story-telling scenes are not in the main feature film. Even worse the opening scene is cut short as well. The thing about the film segment is the tail end of its is used in a separate scene later (i.e. even you went to the trouble of making your own cut you couldn't just slap it in). What is wrong with people today? You might as well record this from television on the next opportunity and edit out the commercials! The only saving grace is the second DVD with features on the making of the film.
3,"While an entertaining movie, its not something I'll be seeing again soon","I think the effects and the plot were fairly outlandish, even for this type of movie. Basically, I didn't think this was as good as any of the Spider Man movies. It was predictable in a lot of places too.I thought Robert Downey Jr. was great in the role, however Gwyneth Paltrow seemed bored and out of place in it."
2,Non Blue Ray sucks,This was a mistake purchase and I will not make this mistake again I assure you. I enjoy the BluRay quality better as the effects and picture quality is simply amazing to say the least
5,Must have for action title for any collection,This is a must have item in any movie collection that includes any action titles. One of the best movies of the year.
4,Well done,"Enjoyable, mostly light-hearted superhero movie with great action. Some material not suitable for young children, better for older kids and adults"
5,The beginning of it all....,"This movie was the starting domino to the rise of the recent Avenger craze in my opinion. Sure the Hulk may have come out first, but Ironman with Robert Downey Jr, as Tony Stark ignited the fuse for the blockbuster that is the recent Avenger Movie"
2,Not Very Good,No action. Pretty bad all around. WAYYY OVERHYPED!Blu ray was alright but movie was not.Luckily I only rented it.
3,"Very good movie, tired old Leftwing politics","Good movie on all levels, but still a leftwing view of the U.S. military, and in that sense disappointing. Very uncreative, politically."
5,Love Iron Man,Great fun family movie. Love RDJ and the entire cast is awesome! The Iron Man saga is truly an adventure in cinema that is worth the price of a ticket. We will continue to support these epic movies.
5,Iron Man : Ultimate Special Edition Limited Isue Head Case,"There isn't much I can say about Iron Man only that the movie is Well done with good acting action special affects & features and so bought the original Iron Man : Ultimate 2 Disc Edition locally & the movie and picture are Great but poor sound quality so was looking out for the same Movie (Blu Ray) on Amazon & market place assuming maybe a better recorded Blu Ray and so bought Iron Man Blu Ray 2 Disc Ultimate Edition Special Limited Issue with an Iron Man Head Case Packaging for a good price from Amazon market place like new with a great picture & way better sound for about the same price they sell in Au's and that's for a Standard Blu Ray Ultimate 2 disc Edition , I have 2 multi region Blu Ray players and played perfect on A US & Central & South America and B region Australia & Europe ... Great ."
4,A good action adventure,"It actually reminds me of the recently released ""Transformers"" remake.Iron Man isn't a new comic book hero.It is all updated to the current events.Gwyneth Paltrow and the villain Jeff Bridges put in very good performancesthat help make it less comic book like.Still the military and a lot of the action has dialog problems:sort of a cardboard/ comic book unreality,that you don't expect in a major studio release like this.I still like it."
1,great fiilm,"to me it was better than spider man 3, not 1,2 and way better than super man returns and the last incredible hulk, you need to sit through the credits, at the very end you will see something important in the movie, the day i was there 80 of 100 or so people left and didnt' realize at the end of the credits ther was still about 2 minutes more of the movie that could leave hints for something, so ifyou see it again, sit through the credits, don't leave to soonit was a decent film, action, and storyplease , please, please i tried my as----ss off trying to click the 5th star i tried for 20 minutes and it wotn let me chose the 5th star i do not think this was a 1 start but a 5 star soplease dont jumpe on me for leaving 1 star thais bull, i tried for 20 minute cliking the 5th star i clciked edit reviw 12 time it will let me re type, re write but won'tlet me clcik nothing but the 1 star, i do not no why"
1,Terrible Movie,Literally one of the worst Movies I have seen. Glad Robert is sober.He was a better actor when he was on drugs. Two thumbs way down.The popularity of this movie shows how boring America really is.You all suck for making this the top grossing movie of all time.IT SUCKS IT IS A BAD MOVIE ROBERT START TAKING DRUGS AGAIN YOU NEED IT!
4,Good Movie. Near Perfect Adaptation.,"I enjoy this film every time I watch it. There was a lot of hype going into Iron Man, and the film satisfied nearly everyone. The action is just enough to please, and to leave the viewer wanting more. The film's pace is brisk and there is nearly no downtime. Downey Jr. perfectly portrays Tony Stark, an immature billionair turned empathetic hero. Jeff Bridges rarely plays a villain, but turns out a believable performance that is a good counterpart to Downey's character. Terrance Howard has a somewhat minor role, but Howard pulls it off greatly; it is too bad that he was replaced for the sequal. Paltrow's take as Stark's assistant is the heart of the film. I hope the sequal is just as good."
4,Blows Dark Knight out of the water,"Now here is a ""comic"" book movie. They didn't mess too much with the costume, it didn't take itself waaaay too serious and it stayed fairly faithful to the source material. Plus we got that real cool set up for the Avengers. When I saw the movie in the theatre all the fanboys went nuts for that little bit at the end of the credits, and I was impressed too. I wish I had thought of it. Downey Jr. is great as Stark (unlike Christian Bale with that silly diguised voice.) It shows that you can stay pretty faithful to the source material and still make a good film. It pleased the fans AND the general audience, AND it really was Iron man. Not a guy in an armored batsuit who usually has the intellect of Sherlock Holmes but (in this movie version) gets others to do his thinking for him. Oh right.... that was another summer film. Iron man was the film of the summer as far as I am concerned."
5,Awesome inside out **SIT THROUGH THE CREDITS**,"I don't even know where to begin the describe how great the film is. Rober Downey Jr. is an excellent actor and he truely shined as Tony Spark. His character grows and develops throughout the film and the ending (sit through the credits) promises a new beginning.The only thing that could've been better is another actress instead of Gwyneth Paltrow. Even though she previously won an Oscar, she is pretty bland and unimpressive as Tony's love interest."
5,Robert Downey Jr. pulls it off!,"I sat down to this one and cringed as I watched Robert Downey Jr, playing Tony Stark, start his comedy schtick (I knew that he would become ""Iron Man""). But guess what . . . he pulled it off. As Tony Stark (and Iron Man), Downey is quirky, consistent, and funny throughout.Great presentation of the Iron Man. Powerful, yet with vulnerablities. And with the offbeat Downey Jr suited up inside - funny. Gwyneth Paltrow was causing smoke to pour out of my TV. A nice comeback by Jeff Bridges. Super special effects.Some violence etc, but no nudity or extreme profanity. I would have no problem with a teen of mine watching this.Fun movie. Be sure to watch the extra scenes (deletions/edits) on the DVD. Good stuff. And the ending leaves the door wide open for ""Iron Man 2""."
3,Love the movie--the video on demand was poor,"Iron Man is a great flick--at least worth a four star rating.But in buying the DVD, we also got the Video on Demand. The playback quality was spotty--it stall several times, searching for signal. The computer that it was playing on was not running any other programs to eat up processing time, and the wireless router is the fastest that Verizon sells. This could just have been an aberration, but I am not likely to pay for any Video on Demand based on the experience."
5,Awesome,Great entertainment for the family movie night or to watch over and over again...because you have always been a fan of Iron Man.
3,Rebuffing,I like the movie but the movie was stalling during the peak of the action. It's rebuffing 2 to 5 times.
2,Left Me Cold As Iron ...,"A big fan of comics, I really, really wanted to like Iron Man, but it left me cold. Wasted talent (Ms. Paltrow (wasted!) & Mr. Bridges, in particular), plot holes, a completely schizophrenic conversion by Tony Stark (""I realize that my family's business is war, so I'll rectify that by building a legendary suit of armor, flying around the world and killing people!""), and racist portrayals of terrorists, the villian du jour.I started getting bored about 1/2 hour into the movie, and it went downhill from there ...Seriously. Hollywood spends a kabillion dollars on this movie, and this is the best script they can come up with? The script felt completely formulaic, paint-by-numbers, and predictable.Finally ... I seem to be in the minority here, but when I watch Robert Downey Jr. acting, all I see is a man playing Robert Downey Jr. ... in every movie."
1,I HATED IT,"It only had one disc when it was suppose to have two. It didnt have any of the papers that was suppose to come with it, it didnt even have a case to come with it. Just sloppy aka I HATED IT!!!!!!!!"
2,Would have worked as an animated straight to dvd movie.,"Iron Man started off OK. But when Tony Stark makes his escape from the terrorists it begins to go downhill. Sure it had it's funny moments as Stark builds his second Iron Man suit as well as one good action sequence once the suit was completed. Jeff Bridges, Terrence Howard and Gwyneth Paltrow were completely wasted. Terrence Howard's character could have been written out of the script without affecting what little story this movie had. The Jeff Bridges character is what Mike Myers mocked as Dr. Evil in the Austin Powers movies, all that was missing was a cat to rub."
4,Good Film for Old and Young,"I've only seen the Blu-Ray version of this film, but the FX are great and the story is good too. Children should enjoy seeing Iron Man transform and develop his costume as he makes improvements to make it bettter and better."
3,Iron Man (single discedition,"Not a bad film overall. The action is pretty consistant throughout. Although Iron Man finding his inner self through adversity was a little corney. The fact that such a brilliant persona counldn't see what was going on under his very nose was probably the crucial element for me. It appeared to mimic what really does go on for some of these people in the real world. So wrapped up in either their work or themselves they can't see the forest for the trees.Overall, acting reasonable, reflection on truth, very close. A good action flick."
4,IRON MAN - Great Movie,"The movie was great. It was in widescreen and we needed full screen. We could not find it as needed so I bought what was available. Went back and looked at product description and finally found ""format"". He enjoys the movie, but would have appreciated the other format."
5,What a movie!,"How can this be? A movie based on a comic book character that not only doesn't suck, it actually improves on the original story of the origins of the character! Unlike most super hero movies, Iron Man is mostly an unknown and therefore easier to work with without totally ruining it for anyone who read and followed the old comics. That said, this is just a great movie with a smart story and excellent casting. Absolutely great to own and can't wait for the sequel."
5,Wish I had found this 3 years ago!,"This is a great reference for those interested in medical schools. My situation is somewhat unique, as I am interested in attending a school in Canada. This provided good, concise information about the medical schools in both the U.S. and Canada. It also has a very good timeline in the front, detailing the things a pre-med student ought to be taking and when. It's a good way to narrow down potential med schools, but also to get started in undergrad pre-med. I recommend this type of reference."
5,A must,"Med school admissions is a crapshoot, let's be real. That said, this is still a must if you're applying. Worth the $."
1,total dissapointment,This is my first review and it has to be really good or really bad for me to take the time to write this. I love hammered dulcimer and like alot of new age music so I figured I'd like this. Wrong. All of the songs sound like an introduction or someone practicing. I couldn't make out any melody that stands out at all. They probably have talent but no writing ability or taste. Save yourself. Flee from this.
2,Must be worn in!!!,I bought this toy for my daughter for her second birthday and she can't play with it on her own. The holes are so tight that the parts won't fit in and she gets really really frustrated. We have had it for about 4 months now and it is just beginning to get worn in so that she can play on her own. I would not buy another potato head product again!
5,The Perfect Opera CD,"I'm so in love with this CD, I'm giving it to as many ppl as I can. It's a great introduction to opera for ppl who don't listen to it very often. It has all the great hits with all the great singers, who can make shivers go down your spine. My friends who don't know opera as much as I do love it too."
1,only 256 color web cam,"My friends, seeing me thru this 256-color camera, mocked that I bought a cheap one. I don't blame them, the quality of the camera is quite unsatisfactory. I suggest you don't buy this alledged 24-bit-color camera."
1,Not worth it,"As the title, it not worth the money at all even at such a low price. The picture quality is bad, very bad. I'd rather spend this money for other web-cam."
1,cheap for a reason,"stay away from this one. I own three different wireless mouse. One for work, one for home and got this one for my little boy. Thought it would be great for smaller hands. Even I can't aim that arrow pointer precisely. Darn thing moves all over the screen, it's virtually useless. Invest little more money on something else. This product should never be in the market, especially in Amazon."
2,Crumbly,"I was looking for Quaker Rice cakes and decided to try these instead. The flavor was bland, but not too objectionable. They were very difficult to eat because they fell apart quite easily. Now they are a snack for my daughter's pet rats."
5,Our Pool looked great all season,I found this pool filter at my local pool store and the price was several hundred dollars more that what I found it on Amazon. The price on Amazon was the lowest I could find. The filter was very easy for my husband to hook up and it was very easy to clean when it needed it. Our pool was crystal clear all season long. We ran the filter on a timer about 6 hours a day. We purchased this product May 2012 and we used it all summer. We look forward to hooking it back up Summer of 2013. I would highly recommend this Hayward filter for above ground pools.
4,Great!,I love the way this product smells! I have really curly hair and I have tried many products to tame them. This one is fabulous!
3,Decent,"This product is decent. It works like most others. I don't think it does that well at controlling frizz, but definitely does do an okay job. I do think it has a bit more greasy feel to it than when you use mousse for example. I guess that tends to make your hair a bit more crunchy. This is softer, but definitely has a bit of grease to it. The product was fine, but nothing super impressive."
3,Not so happy,I BOUGHT THE 7TH EDITION AND VERY UNHAPPY RIGHT NOW AS IT IS NOT SO USER FRIENDLY.I BOUGHT THIS BOOK FROM INDIA AND HAD A TOUGH TIME GETTING THE E-EDITION DOWNLOADED.IT IS DIFFICULT TO GO THROUGH THE BOOK AND COMPUTER AT THE SAME TIME.THE BOOK LOOKS SLIM AND HANDY BUT PROBABLY THE 6TH EDITION WAS BETTER.THE ETIOPATHOGENESIS IN CERTAIN TOPIC GOES TOO DEEP UNNECESSARILY.
4,"Puede mejorar el formato, aumentar los síndromes clásicos.","El hecho de que los volúmenes sean tan grandes empeoran el manejo del mismo. Falta más información sobre síndromes dermatológicos clásicos, fundamentalmente congénitos. La fisiopatología aunque muy amplñia al principio del libro, debería ser más clara y mejor explicada. Falta en los diversos tratamientos que hayan sido contrastados con una medicina basada en la evidencia. No obstante es uno de los libros de dermatología que son imprescindibles para el dermatólogo."
2,Pharm Flash Cards,Not useful at all. Cards do not explain or help learn Pharmacology. Only good for someone who has already learned it and can put it into application. Really useless cards.
2,trop d'anglais,"I felt there was far too much english. I much prefer the immersion method used by ""Victor"" or ""French in Action""And It's not really too far 'beyond' the basics - still the stuff covered in French 101.Garde ton fric et cherche autre chose."
3,Surprised,"I just bought the album today though. There are some really amazing songs on this cd. But there are a lot i dont really care for. I first heard, ""valcono girls"" and really liked it, i think i'd heard it from the movie Jawbreaker.The best songs on the album are ""Volcano Girls"", ""Straight"" and ""Shutterbug"" and ""One Last Time"" to me anyway..."
2,WCW Fall Brawl 1999 review,"The 6 man tag team match between the team of Vampiro & The Insane Clown Posse against The Filthy Animals(Eddie Guerrrero, Rey Mysterio Jr & Billy Kidman) was mostly terrible. The Crusierweight title match between Lenny Lane & Kaz Hayashi was so-so. The NO-DQ tag team match between The First Family(Hugh Morrus & Brain Knobbs) against The Revolution(Shane Douglas & Dean Malenko) was so stupid. The TV Title match between Rick Steiner & Perry Saturn was forgettable. The Berlyn-Jim Duggan match was a dud. The Tag Team title match between The West Texas Rednecks & Harlem Heat was so-so but had a clever finish. The United States title match between Chris Benoit & Sid Vicious was a mediocre David-and-Golitah battle to say the least. The DDP-Goldberg match wasn't as good as their bout from Halloween Havoc 1998. The World title match between Sting & Hulk Hogan was almost as bad as their bout from Starrcade 1997. I give this PPV a 2 out of 10."
1,The Flying Lizards or the B-52s?,"Bizarre is the only word to express the music on this record.There is much bashing on pots with spoons, and most of the percussion-heavy music seems to be created with home-made instruments fashioned from spare car parts and broken washboards.The first track is catchy on the first few listens, but the rest of it is a cacophony of ridiculous, self-indulgent, purile goofiness. Don't waste your money on this one."
3,Not as good as Hot!,"This CD is great just because it is Squirrel Nut Zippers, but some of the songs are too ""different"" and experimental. They are Ok once, but you wouldn't want to listen to them again and again. There are still some good old fashinoned songs like Suits Are Picking Up the Bill, so it is worth buying if you are a fan"
5,Another classic for the Zippers,Squirrel Nut Zippers with the help of the talented Katharine Whalen have produced yet another great album that is destined to become a favorite for new and dedicated Zipper fans alike.
2,Not worth the money!,"I hate this book. Why? There is no way to check your answers to all of the problems. If they would have simply put the answers to every other problem in the back of the book, like most books do you could self educate yourself. There is alot of excellent information in the book and a lot of ""try it"" yourself type problems, but there is no way to check to see if you understood the concepts. This is not a book you could pick up and do the problems, and determine if you even got the answers right. If they would have gave me a way to check to see if I got the problems right, then I would have gave it a 4. I think there is some CD somewhere that has the answers but I couldn't find it. It didn't come with the book. Perhaps it comes with a new book. I bought it used."
1,"management accouting for steve albrecht, et al",this text hasn't included solutions manual that's big trouble for student
4,wickedly wonderful...a great love story......,jessica wishes for so many of the things that most of us women wish for... someone that truly loves you...everything about you. in this book jess gets to have thee ultimate fantasy...not one but two men that love every thing about her... even her stubborness... and the fact that they are truly willing to share there bundle of sass... puts these warriors in a class all there own....when they are with jess you can feel the desire running through their vains... i can't wait to get to the next book... any of MARY WINE'S books....she tells a story that i would love to be a part of....
3,misunderstood,"When reading this book you have to understand that it is fantasy and doesn't require logic. The book requires editing, and more development. The sex scenes were repetitive but well written. When reading this type of book the reader is invited into the fantasies of the writer which is why some people can't understand the fantasy of having two men at the same time. I think overall I would have wished for the author to let her writing mature before she released this book because it needs some work but I loved the story and I understood what she was trying to portray.If you can have an open mind towards erotic fantasy this type of book is worth a read."
3,A Portfolio of Fireplace Ideas,"I wasn't completely thrilled -- we are building a new house and I was hoping for some really spectacular, innovative fireplace ideas, but found few. Many of the photos are old (60's)very boring and dated, and I couldn't understand why they would even be in the book. There were a few fireplaces that were very nice, and modern, but not enough to buy the book for. Does anyone have a suggestion for a great fireplace book?"
5,AMAZING!,"This recording of Donizetti opera arias, many of which were taken from his full length recordings,really show what the big deal about Pavarotti was/is. The voice is unbelievably beautiful, full, and ringing! Pavarotti himself once said that his voice was best suited to Donizetti. The arias from Il Duca d'Alba and Don Sebastiano are so gloriously sung that it makes one sad and mad that he didn't record some of the more rare Donizetti operas. If you want an introduction to opera or just want a recording of Pavarotti this is definitely the one to get."
3,Too much English,Trying to use it to learn French (I know nothing). Even though I am learning it the pronunciation is tough and the DVD just runs through it too fast! Even though you rewind and repeat they pronounce so fast that you cannot imitate them. On the other hand there is too much English used and too much grammar oriented. One does not care about accents in French when one does not even know how to say Hello!
4,A good finish to a great triology.,"I was very entertained by this book. It was a fitting end to the trilogy. I was irritated by all of the complaints of other reviewers about the death of Simon de Montfort. Mrs. Henley wrote these novels to be historically accurate and history was full of great people dying. Get over it! If a historically accurate romance is to be accurate, there will be people dying. I aplaud Mrs. Henley for her historical integrity. Great job on this amazing trilogy!"
3,Pretty Good,"Our baby loves this mobile, but we're not so psyched about it. First of all, it's really LOUD. That's great for playtime, but we were hoping to purchase a mobile to lull our baby to sleep. Secondly, you have to wind it. For the amount of money that it cost, you'd think that it would be automatic. Finally, sometimes the ""winder"" gets stuck (even without over-winding). That's really annoying!"
4,Review,"Bach is better than Handel, is one thing can say. It had an odd plot, never seen before. I forget the kid's name, but he was an odd charcter as well. Watch this movie only if you are a true Bach fan. (Unlike me)"
4,I watched it in choir,"My choir and I watched this movie and I thought it was preaty good, being a composer movie an all."
1,Disappointing,"I read two previous books by Jarman both of which were well written and enjoyable. I recently found this book and was looking forward to reading it, sort of a sequel to ""We Speak No Treason"". What a disappointment! The writing was not of the same quality as the other two and the paperback presents the book like a romance novel. The blurbs on the back about three characters bear no resemblance to anything that actually happens in the story. Don't bother with this one."
4,somewhere between doggystyle and doggfather,"now living in little ol' England it takes a while for me to get hold of tha 'good stuff'(example, i only just got hold of 'murder was the case') and so this had a lot to live up to, and to be honest its not the best he'z ever done, (but then can anything beat doggystyle?) but you will be impressed, his rappin' and delivery is tight as alwayz. basically go out and buy it, whether you like all things snoop or you just want some good hip hop then get this, as well as ice cubes war & peace vol.2"
2,Wouldn't recommend this!,"This album has too many wack songs, i only liked about 5 songs out of 19. Also, KoKane is featured on too many songs and ruins them. The best tracks are Set It Off, Lay Low & Back Up Off Me. Pick up Silkk the Shocker's ""My World, My Way and Master P's ""Ghetto Postage""."
3,Mixed Review...,"I have been reading the other reviews,and it seems like this LP has mixed reactions.Me myself have mixed feelings towards this record.I really enjoy listening to the S-N- double O-P and I'm a huge fan of his music,he brings G funk to every line and this time nothing has changed.But one thang that irritates me is that on every track he has a collaboration and I am not feeling that.I do like the collabs with Nate Dogg ""the king of the hook"" if you ask me.This is a very well produced cd but the popularity isn't there to back it up but if you want a typical original snoop record,go and cop this album,its good enough..."
2,Do not buy this CD,"This album is terrible, the beats are so dull it almost sent me to sleep, and I'm a big Snoop fan. Nuff saidAvoid at all costs"
1,"Horrible album, OVERHYPED TRASH","Don't buy this CD, I listened to it and it's wack. Snoop is trying so hard to be a thug, but it doesn't come through. The production is wack and his flows are tired. Give up snoop. ..."
4,Second Generation Doggystyle,this is doggystyle part II ... the beats are alright.. i can make better but the eery sound in lay low (the best song on there) .. is off of the hook. (great LOFO use) ...well buy it when u get a chance...(L_A_T_E_X)
4,Cut to the chizase...,"I won't go into a bunch of details, but this album bumps. The production level is high, and the rhymes flow. I think it is definitely No limit's best and possibly Snoop's best. I will be honest and say that the only other Snoop album I own is Doggystyle, and Tha Last Meal surpasses it. Call me crazy, but I love this album more and more every time I listen to it. I don't mind the use of Kokane a lot, and all the other guests are tight as well. Like it has already been said, Snoop seems like he is having fun again. It is a fun album, as well as hardcore. Go get it and give it a few listens. It is worth it."
4,"Nice Ride, Would Recommend, But need to fix the sun shade","Overall, from what my wife and I can tell after using this jogger for almost a month now, it does the job for the money and for a 3 year old and 16 month old. Sure, we could have spent the money for the BOB or some other high end stroller but it just didn't seem worth it, and after using the Schwinn Double Jogger, I am glad we didn't spend $400+ on a stroller! My only complaint is the sun visor doesn't lay flat on the bar on the back and it wouldn't be bad if Schwinn would have put a brake on this jogger. Not that you use the brake that much, but if you live in a area with a lot of hills, it would help. I was very easy to assemble, rides smoothly, adjustable handle is nice, the undercarriage storage is nice, and the front rotating/straight wheel adjustment is key for those who run and walk with the jogger. If you are using a jogger for walking, the rotating front wheel is an absolute MUST HAVE!!"
1,product does not match description - bad customer service,"While this product is mostly ok (the angle of the seats is weird for the kids to get used to), it does not match the product description. No weather shield is built in as the description indicates. When I called Pacific Cycle (the manufacturer) to figure out a solution, their support was very unhelpful and actually rude. She couldn't even help me purchase a separate weather shield. I'm sorry that I bought the stroller from a company with such bad service."
4,Great product!,"I did a lot of research on this product and finally settled on this for price, sun shade and the front swivel wheel. When the product came in it was missing a few things and had some damage to the handle bar. The company was very quick to help with the problem and got items out very quickly to fix it. The lower bag carrier has recently broken but again, they shipped a replacement out very quickly.The thing that sold me on this was the sun shade - it's huge! They really needed to put some tention on the hinge so it coudl be moved to a forward position but I've fixed it by looping the jogging tether to the sun shade and when the sun is in the front just letting it slide forward for great coverage. I just hold the tether so it doesn't fall down.I'd defintiely recommend this product for the price."
4,Working well with a little work.,This feeder is made of thick plastic which seems to be holding up very well. It is in a very shady location that the hummingbirds love. I noticed not many were going to this feeder when I first put it up. When the other feeders ran dry they would land on it and then fly away. I took the feeder down and made the feeding holes larger. Problem solved! The feeder is now full with hummingbirds all the time.
3,The hanger does fail,"We own about six of these feeders, and typically have three or more out. The feeders are in direct morning sun in California, and I can confirm that the plastic where the hook is attached to the bottle will fail. I am pretty sure it is UV damage as the plastic becomes brittle and then breaks with only the force of gravity working on the fixture. The birds do love the feeders, I often see six or seven hummers on one feeder. Reminder: around here at least one feeder is about the same as zero. One feeder will be taken over by an aggressive hummer and no others can feed. However two feeders five or ten feet apart cannot be defended, and the bird gives up."
3,A detailed geneology of the descendants of John Coggeshall,"This book probably has a very narrow audiance, but it provides data on all of the descendants of John Coggeshall from his arrival in Newport Rhode Island on the ship Lyon in 1632 through the family members born through about the 1930s. There are some stories of the lives of family members."
3,Broken case,"My case was broken and it did not tell me that before I bought it, Everything else was fine though,"
3,not as good as the rainforest,"This CD doesn't keep me to sleep like the rainforest on does, my husband likes it but I like the rainforest one better"
1,Can I give it a 0?,Okay...if you're looking for a train wreck of a film...this is it. I mean...I love it...but...it needs to be rated a 0. The audio is out of sync after a bit and doesn't sync up until about 20 min left of the movie. At the start of the film they have plastic laser guns that make sounds light up and shoot a light. A bit later the tips of the guns have a light bulb that lights up and there's a sound. Winding down the light bulbs must have burnt out because all you had was a sound while they stood there holding the guns. Finally when they ran out of sound effect budget they were just standing there shaking the guns...I'm not making this up...Seriously I do recommend this movie...after seeing this EVERY OTHER MOVIE will look like it should win an Academy Award.
1,We are the Stuffed men!,"This movie has some of the most painfully bad dialog ever improvised. This movie has special effects that look like they were made for cutscenes for a 16 bit game console. There aren't even any ""Transmorphers"" in this movie at all until over half an hour in! The focus is on the humans though. The humans have to destroy the ""invincible"" robots. The Transmorphers are all apparently evil robots who for some reason made the sky dark and killed off 90% of all humanity. This movie is a horrible, putrid waste of time, makes no sense, and features the worst of everything in every category ever. This isn't just one of the worst direct-to-video releases ever, this is one of the worst movies ever."
4,Worth watching,"I didn't think I'd like it at first with all the subtitles. However, never judge a book by it's cover. It took a few days to watch because it's jumpy. Check it out."
5,Best movie I've seen in a long time,"My only real standard for a movie is that it be entertaining without resorting to shock value or cheap tricks, such as lots of explosions (think Transformers), in order to be entertaining. This movie was great because it was very entertaining and didn't resort to using either of the two. It had car chases, fight scenes, beautiful women, beautiful skylines, beautiful geography, a good sound-track, and some surprises thrown in. All very well done. And all of it was somewhat believable - nothing ridiculously unbelievable like is often seen in a Tom Cruise movie or a Will Smith movie. Actually, for some reason this reminded me a little of a James Bond movie, except this movie was actually good. And it was 100x better than the Marvel comics crap that seems to be all the rage nowadays. I gotta start watching more foreign (non-American) movies...that is where the good stuff is nowadays. If you like well-done action/thriller movies, I recommend this 100%."
4,[...],"As a professional photographer this works really well, it is briliant and enables me to take great close up images with my 100mm lens, when enlarged to 40x60 inches my canvas prints look fantastic."
1,Ouch.,"Should've quit while he was ahead. I used to be a HUGE Billy fan, but this CD does not live up to the others. To bad."
4,Nice to see...,"This was actually the first album I bought by Idol, when it was released. And while I might have been expecting some ""White Wedding""-ish tunes, I was pleasantly surprised. It's even more current today than when it was released, the rest of the world has caught up to Idol's vision, whether they realize it or not."
5,Not Your Typical Idol,"Cyperpunk is not your typical Billy Idol material. Cyberpunk is darkly creative beginning with the first song, Wasteland, to the last untitled song. The material takes you on an imaginary journey, telling you a story of first despair and loss and finally hope.While recognizable as Billy Idol, Cyberpunk is a clear departure from Billy's usual work and represents an important artistic evolution in Billy's discography. Many artists content themselves with producing the same sounds over and over for years; it took courage for Billy to go through with this experiment. Maybe if he had released the album a few years earlier or later, it would have generated more interest and a warmer reception. Nevertheless, Cyberpunk is my favorite of all he has done so far."
5,Great Stroller!,"After reading about the drawbacks to this stroller, I was hesitant to order it without first testing it myself. I received it a few days ago and was pleasantly surprised. Many of the drawbacks listed in other comments were not that major.1. Re: size of stroller when folded - My car is a 2000 Honda Accord, and the stoller fits fine in the trunk IF I TAKE OFF THE REAR WHEELS. The other jogging stroller model I considered also required removal of the rear wheels.2. Re: stroller reclining too much - The angle of inclination can be adjusted by adjusting the straps at the back of the seat to almost any angle you want.3. Re: difficulty of folding stoller - Yes, the stroller is hard to fold completely with only one hand, but it mostly folds by itself. I think most non-umbrella type strollers will require both hands to fold.Overall, this is a great stroller. For traveling though, another stoller is definitely required."
4,"Overall, great stroller","Good1. Smooth ride for my little one2. Well made, good construction3. Attractive4. Light enough (as far as jogging strollers under $200 go)5. Front and rear wheels locks quickly easily and securely6. HUGE hood for shadeBadFolding / portability is HORRIBLE. If you have a small trunk you're counting on it fitting in, dont. It's very bulky, even ""folded"", if thats what you want to call it. I have a minivan with no 3rd row seat so I'll get by just fine. I just dread the day I HAVE to fit into my wife's Toyota Corolla =\Otherwise, its a great stroller!"
4,After 1 month of Use,"Product Description - my comments* Reclining seat - Its really a lace that you can adjust yourself at any level* Extra thick padded seat- Its really not, as other recommend, I added my own padding* One hand fold - it still takes me both hands to fold.* Under seat storage basket - as others say, the basket looks as it will fall down. I really don't know why it is not re-enforced.* Rear parent storage pouch - although it might be the same size as a folder, it is also as thin as a folder. May be difficult for people with large hands.Overall, stroller is light to push/maneuver. If I could, I would: add a hand break, re-enforce storage basket, and a lid to the parents' tray."
1,Vendetta,"I read the book already, and truly enjoyed the excitement. Thanks for recommending it to me."
3,Distraught,"As many books, this one is a good thriller at the beginning but as you read further it lacks in substance and gets boring and boring. Albeit this is my first book by F.M. she made Jack appears as the good guy and the sisterhood as the bad vigilante guys. I don't think that a hit-and-run accident deserves the punishment they gave to Chai so at the end I think that this sisterhood is utterly distraught and insane."
1,Horrible!,"Someone had hit and killed Maya's daughter as she was crossing the street. For revenge, Maya and her friends capture him, imprison him and cane him until he is disfigured.This is sick. No matter how much you would hate the person who killed your daughter, nothing like this will make her come back, or make you feel any better.The author does a poor job portraying the driver of the car as an evil person the reader would want sucha thing to happen too."
1,Stupid and Sick,"I've read many of Fern Michaels' books and have enjoyed all of them. I am currently reading Vendetta and am quiting at the halfway point, which I NEVER do. The story is so unbelieveable and stupid, and now it's looking to turn sadistic. I just can't believe this is the same author I've read before!!!"
1,Worst book ever!!!!,I have never written a review here before but I had to for this absolutely horrible book. I couldn't stand the thought of someone else wasting their time or money on this. I love books and never throw them out because of sheer respect for them. But this one is going right in the trash so that there is no chance anyone else will stumble on to it. Absolutely terrible writing.
3,Vendetta (Sisterhood Series),"I have read many of the Sisterhood series, not necessarily in the order they were written. While I found this one interesting, I didn't think it was as well done as some of the others. I'm not sure why -- maybe I just found it too far out there to be believable."
2,Not what I expected,My mother and I share books. She was thrilled with this book and the entire sisterhood series. This is the first book that I have read. I am hoping that missing the beginning of the series is the only reason why this book was not appealing. I found the story extremely far-fetched and story really didn't hold my attention. I will give the author another chance but I found this story to be a waste of time.
3,Too many scenes cut off!!,"I love this soap opera but it has the same problem as the first season: they cut off too many scenes. If you buy DVDs of Friends, for example, actually it includes more scenes but with Rebelde the exact opposite happens.They almost never mention Lupita's sister Lola. Again they do not show Lupita's romances. And a funny story about Mia's dog and how she hid it never appears.I don't know why they cut scenes. They should make at least 4 double discs and charge a little more.I should give it 1 star but since I remember some parts of the ""novela"" and I enjoy watching it I will give it 3 stars.I only recommend it to people who have watched it on T.V."
4,"Works great, looks decent for a slipcover","I use this to protect my couches from my 2 border collies. Their claws have snagged the waffle weave a bit but it's ok with me, at least it's not the couch. I throw this in the washer and dryer and I think it has shrunk slightly. But it actually fits better now for my couches."
3,A little boring,I find the songs repetitive and too long to listen. The first 20 seconds of each songs really sum up what you can expect for the rest of them. I got tired of this CD quickly.
3,"Good merchandising info, math not too helpful","As a newcomer to merchandising, I found this book's explanations of key terminology and tips on merchandise planning to be very helpful. The math, however, was entirely too simplistic to be of much use. This book contains an entire chapter on how to use a calculator. If you're looking for a good general overview of the field, this is a good book. But anyone with an elementary education should already know the math."
5,So easy to follow!,"I am taking a retail math class in college and using this book. I always hated math, and never did well in high school. This book is easy for me to follow, and most of all it really is step by step and now all the math work makes sense. I know what I am learning now will help me throughout my merchandising career."
1,Be careful. The reviews are misleading.,I have been doing the Biggest Loser and Jillian Michael's DVDs for a couple of months now and because of the reviews for this one I thought it would be great. I DID NOT LIKE THIS ONE AT ALL. Too fast paced from the beginning. There is no warm up. It's all out from the moment you start and with bad knees I have to start slower and work into the faster paces. There is no lead in to the change of exercises. Didn't like the music. Didn't like much of anything about it. Was actually glad my daughter broke it after the first time I tried it because I would not have done it again. I much prefer the Jillian Michaels and Biggest Loser DVDs.
5,"No Frills, Low Price","This is a fine, no frills table cover the fits my 4.5x9 Gold Crown III table with no problems. Small weights in each of the corners hold the cover in place. It is durable, yet folds easily."
4,I WAS HOPING THIS WAS THE HBO SPECIAL,THIS IS NOT THE HBO DOCUMENTARY....IT HAS MUCH OF THE SAME INFORMATION AND MAIN PEOPLE FEATURED IN THE HBO VERSION...THE JACKSONS ARE SPECIAL PEOPLE AS WAS BARBARO'S TRAINER AND HIS DOCTOR AT THE NEW BOLTON CENTER IN PA. HE TRIED SO HARD AND WAS ALMOST SUCCESSFUL IN SAVING BARBARO...I CRY EVERY TIME I WATCH THIS AND WISH I HADNT WATCHED THE ACTUAL RACE WHEN THIS HAPPENED.. JOCKEY EDGAR PRADO HELD BARBARO FROM RUNNING ANYMORE AND DOING MUCH MORE DAMAGE TO HIS ALREADY BADLY SHATTERED LEG.. OWNERS GRETCHEN AND ROY JACKSON ARE THE KINDEST AND MOST HUMANE AND LOVING PEOPLE IVE EVER SEEN ....BARBARO WAS TRUELY A CHAMPION...WHAT A HORSE!
5,America's hero,We had been trying for ages to purchase this DVD and we are so glad we found it on Amazon.com. This is a fantastic DVD which shows all Barbaro's great races and his courageous fight for life after his tragic injury in the Preakness. We have all the books on this superhorse.
1,rain forest relaxation cd,there is a scream like sound in this cd - i had to get up and shut it off to make sure someone was not screaming outside! haven't used it since!
4,looks good,"Good quality poster, pretty big. I bought mine off ebay and it's more expensive there. Looks fine, but had this weird adhesive stuck to the top right corner (it WAS sealed and new) and it also was a tiny bit blurry. It's a good way to remember the great Busch Stadium, though, and it looks really good on my wall. Almost 2'x3'"
4,For starters...,"Well I haven't heard the entire album yet, still waiting for it in the mail.But the songs I have heard on the net are awesome. ""Dark and Weary World"" is my favorite song. It paints a perfect picture of northern California coast, my home. Awesome indie-country group. I recomend them."
3,ordered wrong book,"I ordered this book but it turns out I ordered the wrong one. I wanted the newer printed one. This book is exactly as described, just not the one I wanted. This book is written with older style type and is not easy to read. However, the seller gave a good description and it was mailed promptly. The mistake was mine."
4,airaid pre filter,Easy to put on and very easy to use. Looks great and helps keep your filter clean. I think it is worth the money.
3,More letters by Stewart,"This edition of letters by Elinore Pruitt Stewart was expressly commissioned by Atlantic Monthly for publication in their magazine. I believe that affected the tone of her letters; they appear a tad more stilted and contrived than her other two collections. For one thing, Elinore did not enjoy hunting, at least she states that in the beginning. But her letters still hold a quaint charm to them. If you really want her best book, read ""The Adventures of a Woman Homesteader"" as these letters were not all published and reveal a bit more of her true personality, not what she thinks folks reading a magazine might like or want to read. Still, I did enjoy her accounts revolving around going hunting, particularly her observations of nature and the people encountered. She has a certain way with words that make you picture things well in your mind from her description."
5,Very Good Softbill Food,"This food doesn't look fancy, but there are two things that really set it apart in my mind (besides the requisite low iron formula, a must for softbills). First, the pellets are small enough that all or most softbills can eat them. In the past, we've owned a toucan and a starling and we currently own a mynah. All of them, even the tiny starling, could eat these pellets, even without pre-moistening. Less waste! Second, the pellets are uniform in size and color which prevents the birds from only eating the red pellets. I don't know what it is about softbills, but every one we've ever had would eat only the red pellets if given the choice. As they can be really stubborn, like vaguely to the point of self-starvation, it's better not to even let them go down that path."
2,Projection ALTERNATES between Time and Temp -- ugh.,"I didn't like how small the projected image was compared to the Oregon Scientific projection clocks. Very small 'font' versus nice big letters from Oregon Scientific projection clocks.Also, the projection alternates -- slowly -- between time and outside temperature. Very frustrating to wake in the middle of the night, quickly glance-up to see what time it is, but having to WAIT for the projector to cycle back to time display. You can turn-off the external temp display (only do time), but that's the whole point of the product -- right?I love gadgets, but in the end this one falls short."
5,Projection weather station,"La Crosse Technology Projection Weather StationA great product! Would definitely recommend it to anyone who likes the projection feature. We use it in the bedroom as an alarm clock. Also, you know what the temp is when you get up on those cold winter mornings."
4,Does the Job right!,The Nav Traffic tuner works great! No issues and easily installed. Nice install all the way and I'm no expert to be sure. thanks.
5,To get to love jazz,"Again, it is clear: the quality of the singing voice reaches its top when it sounds like an instrument. Patricia Barber has perfect timing and what is more, she has a terrific sense of humor. In ""If This isn't Jazz"" it is displayed with intelligence, not only in the words but especially in the use of the instruments (the hauling guitar) and when she sings: ""if the real thing is coming along"" she's telling the truth.As pointed out by my predecessors the sound quality is superb, listen to ""The Beat Goes On"" and hear the public in the background clapping to the rhythm. The rhythm section is best judged by listening to ""Black Magic Woman"", it leaves the Santana performance far behind. Strictly speaking we cannot say that what Patricia Barber does is jazz, it is fusion, but fusion in her own way, more reminiscent to jazz than what Holly Cole or Cassandra Wilson do."
4,Good Find,"I used this product to replace a remote in a rental home. It needs no codes and accomplished the purpose just fine. A little bulky, though and I personally prefer a different feel, but for my money and this purpose, you couldn't go wrong. I bought an extra just so I have a spare when this one gets ""lost""."
5,Very nice,"Ignore the idiot that gave the fine album a low rating! Without a doubt this is one of the finest albums by one of the finest jazz groups! It is not ""Cool Jazz"" -- that's the sort of music that gives jazz a bad name and causes fools to forget about the REAL intellectuals of jazz -- and no one could do meditative jazz like MJQ. Like all great jazz, this album is as meaningful as any music can be.[5 years later] It's still quite good. But, Milt Jackson unleashed without the MJQ is far better, and bouncier. I didn't realize I was such an MJQ fan five years ago!"
5,An action/thriller with great humor,This book is a great read. It takes off in the first chapter and never lets up. The hero Matt Wilder is a classic action hero and there are two remarkable bad guys the likes of which I have never seen. Highly original. I enthusiastically recommend it.
1,I'm not sure I will finish this thing.,"After just a few chapters it's impossible to continue accepting the juvenile premise... Russia, China, et al, just sit around while a new Mongol empire forms in their midst? It's like a teen slasher movie for the Tom Clancey set."
1,Spark and die,"The only reason to read this book is if you're really bored, because it has nothing new to offer at all. While the writer is satisfactory, all the story does is rehash the past. Nothing important happens. So, its basically as though the author has turned an episode transcript into a narrative. For someone who's been obsessed with btvs, especially Spike, for a long time--it was a real disapointment. It's basically a kids book and Buffy was never really a kids show."
2,Boring,"No new information here, boys and girls. I was hoping for some new insight into Spike. This book basically looks at half of season two from Spike's perspective. I don't think that his character was fleshed out more that the series already had done, or new or interesting stories were explored (with the single exception of explaining how Spike got on the German sub). I was hoping for some snarky dialogue, ripping action scenes, and secrets revealed. Instead, just a tired re-hash of season 2. Skip it."
3,"An enjoyable read, but doesn't break any new ground!","The book is an enjoyable read, but don't expect anything new. 90% of this book is quoted directly from previous episodes of Buffy and Angel (althought NOT after Spike's return). It fills in some VERY minor points in between, but it doesn't break any new ground. From that perspective, it was definitely a disappointment. Especially after parting with $6.99. On the other hand, it's nice to have most of the Spike story contained in one book. It's a worthy read, but try to find it at your local library or borrow it from a friend!"
2,Not as good as their first,"Without a doubt, the premiere release from Eve6 back in 1998 was a much better album that kept your head bumpin' and had you singing along. The only time you do that with their second release, ""Horrorscope,"" is during the first three tracks, which soon grow old along with the rest of the album.If you want an Eve6 album with much better lyrics and great music that doesn't get worn out, get their first, self-titled CD. If you want the exact opposite, get ""Horrorscope.""Sad, but true."
4,Great CD!!,"I love listening to this CD. it's one of the few that you can listen to the whole thing straight without getting tired of the songs. there's many different varieties of songs. The first three tracks (rescue, promise, on the roof again). I'd definately say would be the best."
3,Great songs almost ruined by heavy handed production.,"These guys have very creative lyrics and good music to go with them. However, their producer for this CD decided to fill in the ""empty spaces"" in their songs with way too much synth. The synth tramples on the vocals on some songs, almost drowning them out by competing for the same sonic space. While some of keyboard sounds do fit in OK, most of the time it has the flavor of a bad re-mix job. The producer should have stayed away from the ProTools and just let the music ""breathe"" a little more --- their lyrics and hooks deserve to be heard, not to be drowned out.Other than that problem (which makes the CD difficult for me to enjoy listening to in spots), it's pretty good. As the Amazon.com reviewer said, if you like synth/keyboard, you might like it more than I do, but you had better really like them because they overpower everything else in many spots."
3,not really what i was expecting...,"okay, the more i listen to it the more i like it. but at first i thought, ""is this eve 6? is this the raw-sounding band that blew me away with their first album?"" not so much. yeah, it's a good album and hook-laden and whatever, but it's over-produced. i think that the lack of raw intensity makes this album a little, well, less intense. not as emotional. believe me, i find myself singing the songs all the time, but i think eve 6 has a lot more potential than this. they're kind of taking a direction that i hate to see bands take. of course, this is all personal and many of you may not agree, but i would pick their first album over this one any day. i just really hope they blow me away with their next album because i really love these guys. i mostly hope that they're going in the direction they want to be going instead of a direction in which they're told to be going. so, hey, you don't have to agree with me, but that's what i think."
3,OK,"When I first heard Promise on the radio I thought wow, this song is great and so I went out to buy the cd. Well like their first cd I probably bought it for that one song because the rest are OK. The song On The Roof Again is pretty good, but I would recommend this cd if you truly love Eve 6 otherwise you should just buy the single."
1,Terrible: A Let Down By A great Band,"This album is terrible. If you want real Eve 6, check out their debut and It's all in your head. I couldn't believe that this was Eve 6. A big dissapointment."
1,YOU DON'T NEED A HORRORSCOPE TO SEE THE HORROR!,"Eve 6 latest is horrible. The production is so-so, the songs all sound the same - you can't tell one, and I mean one of them apart except for maybe the lyrics.The lead vocalist voice never changes range and the album becomes mundane and boring.The worst of the 12 cuts are ""Bang"", ""Nightmare"" and ""Nocturnal"" which this album will make me if I keep listening to it.Back to the resale bin at my nearest used CD record store. This group should go back to the studio and start from scratch.I say buy the CD for its cover and frame it."
3,Isla Blair's diamond necklace,"This one must have been less riveting than the two earlier series, because I spent a lot of time trying to get a better look at the diamond necklace Isla Blair was wearing. Since she was wearing little else in several scenes, I should be able to sketch it.I won't say that the series was more unbelievable than the other two, because F.U. was so unbelievably evil in those, but it lacked the clever world-of-its-own logic that made the others brilliant. The first and second series had the light attitude of an evil Jeeves (or a Saki short story). This one lost that and tried to be a regular drama. Far too heavy a sea for a toy sailboat.If anyone wants help me with the necklace, however...was it a bezel setting, or a slide?"
2,Disappointing,"I was impressed with the comfortable seating that has a nice amount of padding, the built in rain shield is a nice feature and overall the stroller looked like a great find. It assembled easily although is a bit wide to manage, and won't fit through most doorways. The disappointing part was trying to use the stroller. It pulled strongly to the left and was impossible to use as a walking stroller so jogging was out of the question. I used the help line for Pacific Cycle and after trying all of their recommendations for correcting the problem, I ultimately returned the product. The return process went smoothly for which I was also grateful."
5,Amazing,"This album displays an amazing talent. Marc Copland and the trio show a huge range of musicality. The ensemble playing is amazing as they play off each other, playing around the beat and clearly communicate with each other. The songs display original structure, extensive cross-rhythms, polyrhythms and the use of a wide range of colours & tones by all 3 musicians. There are a wide variety of tempos and but all songs have a groove. The harmonic variety provides a range of levels of artistic reflection. Several of the songs make me smile. I highly recommend this album."
2,too expensive,"I was really wanting a bright easy to hold flashlight. I considered buying one of these, but instead bought a small maglight that uses 3 AAA batteries that are suppose to last like 100 hours or something. It has three modes:High,Low, and Strobe. But the important aspect is that when the flashlight is turned on, it's like looking at the back of God. It is really almost to the point where it is too bright. It shines a beam easily over 100 yards. Oh yeah, and it only cost 30 bucks at a local hardware store."
3,Okay game,The controls are hard to masterGameplay is okaycampaign is too hardnot enough robotsGraphics okay for DS
3,Todays changing workplace,"Richard Sennetts book entitled The Corrosion of Character: The Personal Consquences of Work in the New Capitalism is a well written and informative book about the economic changes and conditions going on in America's workplace today. Sennett uses examples in his book about janitors, IBM workers, and Boston bakers as case studies to get some of his points accross. He paints a picture of how each of these professions has changed over the years. These examples are deeply thought out and explained in detail. He even makes the examples so easy to understand that even a young adult can follow along. The only downside to his book is that the author gives no soloutions to the problems inour changing workforce. He just explains why things are the way they are. If you are intrested in learning about the changes in our workforce, this is a book for you."
5,Will Get You In Shape!,I LOVE this product! If you want to get in shape fast this is the excercise dvd for you. I have not played basketball since highschool some years ago and after 4 weeks of RUSHFIT I know I'm in better shape than I was then. Like any exercise program you get out of it what you put in it. The instructor is very informative and St Pierre makes me feel better when I'm doing a movement and even he has a hard time with it. Some of the moves are advanced but the instruction guide at the start of the dvd is very helpful explaining the moves before you actually do the workout. It is hard work but I guarantee if you put forth the effort you will see results. I would recommend this to anyone who doesn't want to buy all kinds of equipment because you only need really 3 sets of dumbbells and your own body weight. I love RUSHFIT and will continue onto the next 2 levels!
5,good program,"I haven't had a full chance in doin this program, but i must say, when i did do disc one, i was at aww...i mean, i was like ""really? you want me to do what?"" but in a good way. I love to have challenges put to the test and this is a good challenge :)"
4,Love this!,"I am 56 years old (female) and, though I walk alot and use free weights, I felt that my over all conditioning was weakening. One thing that scared me was that I was having a harder time getting up from the floor. I started this program and I was pleased with how much of it I can do. I love the exercise where I am in the plank position on hand weights lifting one arm at a time. Cool. Makes me feel like I'm awesome. My husband saw me doing the program and he wanted to do it, too. He had scoliosis as a kid and has to be careful with his back, so I wasn't sure this was a good idea. He started with just a few reps and built up and he is doing great. He does some of the strength moves that I can't do. We tailor this workout to our bodies, rotate the dvds as it suits us and this has been very successful. Oh, and getting up from the floor? You have to do that a lot during this workout--the result is that I am much stronger and flexible."
3,"Unless you absolutely need it now, wait until after June 24...","Xanadu:Magical Music Edition DVD is being released by Universal on 6/24 (SRP also $19.98). Extras will include the Going Back to Xanadu featurette and the film's theatrical trailer, along with the complete soundtrack on CD. It would be nice if it had two DVD commentaries, one featuring the Director, ONJ and Michael Beck and the second featuring comments from Jeff Farrar and Jeff Lynne. One hopes the complete soundtrack CD also includes Fool Country, Drum Dreams and the instrumental opening score.However, if you must have a copy RIGHT NOW of this great campy flick featuring great tunes by Electric Light Orchestra, and Olivia Newton-John (duetting with ELO, Cliff Richard, The Tubes and Gene Kelly ... take that Frank Sinatra and Tony Bennett!), you can't go wrong with this currently available edition of this nicely priced DVD, which features the original trailer and actors and production credits."
1,Still don't have it,"I ordered this DVD on May 25 along with an item from another seller. I received the other product, a hardcover book, in less than a week. It's a month today since I placed the order and I still do not have it. I contacted the seller who told me it could take up to 6 weeks to arrive and to contact again if I hadn't received it by June 29. I'm thinking a hardcover novel shouldn't take 1/6 the delivery time of a DVD. I only rated the product one star because I assumed it would register as an error if I didn't choose."
1,Bad Soundtrack,"The movie is fun and entertaining; All that I remember of it but I have to tell you the sound track is horrible. I tried it on a HD TV with a quality sound output, A computer with an advanced sound system and an HD DVD Player hooked up to a high quality sound system. Yuck. My recording onto cassette from the original tape version of the movie was better than the sound coming out of this DVD. Bad balances, distortion, you name it. Highly disappointed. Let's face it, Olivia is nice to look at and the concept is fun and different but the music makes the movie and without the sound having decent quality it might as well be a silent movie."
3,"OK, I admit it, I liked it!","I was a college sophomore when my roommate (a big Olivia Newton-John fan) dragged me to see ""Xanadu"" at the movies back in 1980. Despite my intention to hate the movie, I actually enjoyed it -- both the first time and a half-dozen other times he managed to get me to the theater. The roller-boogie sequences are really pathetic, but overall, the goofy energy and awkward electricity generated in this love story make it worth watching. Gene Kelly really makes the movie for me; he is a wonderful father (or grandfather) figure, and when he is off screen, the movie just kind of limps along to the expected finish. Olivia Newton-John is a fresh-faced sweetie, and the music really grows on you if you give it a chance."
2,Bizarre,"I remember watching and loving Xanadu as a kid, but watching it now at 29, all I can say is that this is one strange movie. Nothing in it makes sense -- the protagonist (Michael Beck) is a lazy artist who falls for a muse (Olivia Newton-John) who is sent to him for inspiration or some silly reason that the movie never makes clear, except to give them musical montages featuring ""Magic"", Olivia's big hit at the time. Actually that is the real reason for the movie's existence: the music, and admittedly, the music is very good.Along with the music, the film does have some interesting aspects including the roller disco scenes. They are well-choreographed even if they are tacky. And the movie's fashions and hairstyles (shot in '79/'80) are a curious hybrid of late 70s culture and 80s fashions/trends and to the film's credit, it eerily predicts the fashions/trends of the 80s (much of what is seen onscreen would be popular in just a few years -- 1983/84)."
4,It Will Put a Spell on You,"One of the most overlooked movies of the 1980s, ""Xanadu"" is a silly, campy, guilty pleasure of a movie. It has catchy tunes, Olivia Newton-John skating around in cute little outfits singing about. Old fogey Gene Kelly still has it when he's dancing. The romance is fun, the music is fun, and the production numbers are fun. Yes it is flawed, but does entertain and that's what counts. Some of the skate dancing sequences are just fabulous!"
4,ELO,"I saw this movie when it first came out. I thought it was phenomenal. I loved the childlike innocence of it all. Of course, in hindsight, I have to say now... to call it dated is an understatement. I am going to recommend this movie though... if for only one reason. It introduced me to the music of The Electric Light Orchestra. As dopey as this movie seems... I keep comming back to it."
4,What's different?,"I bought this new and improved DVD last year, but now I noticed it is being re-released in February 2009. What is different in this version? Did they just remove the soundtrack? Anyone? Bueller? Bueller?"
2,the lies about complete sound trak,"the only improvement is the animorphic widescreen. the sound track that comes is exectaly the same as the one they releised as a single cd. the two missing songs that were reliesed as the flip side of the 45's are still missing from the cd that comes with it, making it incomplete."
4,eh.,"i love xanadu. we watched over and over as kids and roller skated all the time in the early 80's. as for this package...i like the art work (except the slip cover with the sticker that will not peal off), i liked the retrospective, though i was disappointed olivia was not interviewed on it. i ordered this edition for the ""complete soundtrack."" it said complete so i assumed fool/country would be on it as well as the second duet w\between olivia and gene kelly and maybe even some of the instrumental. it is the same soundtrack that you can but separately.so, it's really not complete. but it was great seeing olivia and xanadu again!"
4,If you love Olivia Newton-John ...,"If you love Olivia Newton-John, as I have since I first saw her, then this is a ""ten"". It captured her in time, never allowing her beauty and cute-ness to change. It is a cherished part of my collection.If, on the other hand, you are a connoisseur of great acting skills and direction, you will likely rate it considerably lower ... ""If you love her, let her know. If you don't, please let her go ... ""Personally, I highly recommend owning it, if for no other reason than escaping from the ""real"" world on those days when you aren't recognizing the ""magic in your own life."""
5,The longest day reviewed by a high school student.,"I have seen the longest day and read the book. Obviously I am going to say I enjoyed the book more then the movie but I think they go hand in hand. The book is add suspense while the movie seems a little less serious and tries to add comic relief. Also the book is very detailed while the movie just brushes over a some accounts. I liked this book becuase it was, or felt like a series of actual personal events from various soldiers. For the most part the book sounds like soldiers letters or daries put into a fairly accurate timeline with d-day. My favorite account would be the german officer that was so shocked by the landing he didn't notice his boots where on backwards until after the day had passed."
5,great read. Many short stories.,"It was a great read. It was comprised of thousands of short stories. It must have taken months and years to compile all his interviews. The different sources he uses, really makes it amazingly interesting."
3,Not recommend if you want a good bass effect.,"It is not good enough. There is only one volume control, no bass control.I am kind of not satisfy with the bass effect."
3,no base controller,"I wouldve given a 5, but for no base controller. Sound is awesome, very clear and cut, base is also awesome, but no controller. You will have to use some software to control it, but that doesnt help too much."
4,The Bothersome Man,Very interesting and thought provoking movie. It causes you to look at your life and at the people around you in a different manner
1,Not Current,"This book is NOT what it's advertised to be. If you're looking for bike info on any model year after 1997 you won't find it here. Yes, the copyright date shows ""2010,"" but this is a farce. There isn't a line of info in here less than 13 years old. Nothing about the Yamaha V-Star, Road Star, Roadliner, nothing about HD's 96 c.i., nothing about Suzuki's M109, etc., etc. Useless!"
2,not as good as others I've tried,"I bought these because they look a lot like the kind target used to carry.The ones I was hoping to replace are smooth and light, yet strong. They work as swimsuits, if you don't want one of today's bulky saggy soggy neon beasts covering half your body when you swim. The only downside to the target ones is that the elastic ages pretty quickly from all the (chlorinated) water.These were more expensive and slightly longer, but swimming in silk still beats most other materials, so I gave it a try.They aren't as comfortable, as briefs. They do move around and get stuck more than they should. The elastic, while nicely stronger than the target ones, feels slightly too industrial to me. The fly is, for whatever reason, too easy to, shall we say, accidentally bypass.And I know they aren't made for swimming, but I do want to add that the fabric seems to be aging VERY quickly - after only half a dozen uses, it feels thinner and stiffer than it did."
2,silk boxers,"It's hard to buy clothes without trying them on first, even underwear. I bought the Wickers softsilk boxer along with these. The wickers are a lot more comfortable. I work outside (physical) and do not recommend these boxers for anyone who has to do a lot of moving, bending, climbing etc. They are a lot shorter than the wickers, I guess being different companies they size differently. I only wear these when I do not intend to move much. Wish I would have kept the packaging. I DEFINITELY would have sent these back. Nice material just to short."
1,Sizing ridiculous,"After purchasing a pair of Intimo boxers that were great, I ordered 6 more directly from the company - all in size Medium like the first pair I had. The all ran much bigger, including 1 of the 6 that must have been an XL! Unfortunately I washed them before trying them and Intimo wouldn't take them back. Horrible customer service!"
2,Sizing Problem??????,"Intimo Men's Classic Silk BoxersI have tried to order Maron/Burgundy Silk Boxers twice, and had to return them both times! The first time I ordered 2 pairs,1ea Forest 304 X-Large, & 1ea Maron/Burgundy X-Large*(40-42)**Per the Sizing chart referenced at the time of selection!The Forest 304 X-Large fit find,But the Maron/Burgundy X-Large was Soooooo much smaller?They were both ordered as X-Large*(40-42)*but when I laid them down on my bed, one on top of the other I could see the difference right away.The Forest 304 measured 17.5 inches across.But the Maron/Burgundy X-Large measured only 15 inches across. Both Times?Why the difference? Suppose to be the SAME SIZE! X-Large*(40-42)*Does amazon.com/Intimo have a SIZING Problem!!!!!Do they Care?"
2,too small!!,I likw silk and it could be nice product. I bought size XL but really it was like M! so its smaller sizez then they said. I have to return it but i really hate return so next time I will not order it
2,overkill,The only way to handle the depravity this film wants to play out is by suggestion.This film aims to be real and convincing but it is impossible to act out because its deeds are beyond any actress' range of imagination barring a similar sort of experience which would be getting too sick to dig up for any method acting. The alternative left is to be histrionic and let THAT be the suggesstion to project the depravity this film wants to play out. Of course many don't recognise it as bad acting so that works too.For me less is more ( ie : Audition ; Silence of the Lambs Blair Witch ) ) and histrionic overkill just brings out my dark sense of humour which is a scary-funny horror genre of its own too.That said this film comes up with a few nasties I hadn't heard of. Another reason to still watch 'em I suppose.
2,Just fair,"For the beginner this is a decent INTRODUCTION to water gardens but it is loaded with inconsistencies, lacks definitions (a glossary), is illogical in many places and left me frustrated many times trying to understand the basic stuff. Again a decent introduction to water gardening but the serious ""gardener"" would be well advised to look to other sources."
1,shredded,"My daughter bought this as a Christmas present for my wife. As soon as we put it on, the webbing that connects it to the stroller handle shredded on both sides. I'm sure this is a random, weird occurrence, but when I contacted the seller (NOT B.O.B. directly), I've still gotten no response two weeks later. Watch who you buy from people!"
3,not great for a bumbleride indie twin,"so this works on the bumbleride, but not great. It just fits on the handle and the part that holds keys hits the middle bar...so its not great. the cup holders work though and thats what I got it for, I just wish bumbleride made one."
5,Love it!,"Easy to assemble, holds alot, just wish it came with the stroller instead of having to purchase separately"
2,SO not worth it,"First, let me be clear. We LOVE LOVE LOVE the Revolution Duallie Stroller. Worth every penny. But for $500, it really should come with a cup holder! Also, the entire tray is very flimsy, the pack in the middle is tiny, and the cup holders are narrow. They are deep, which is why this product got two stars instead of one. But it's just ridiculous that such an expensive, and high quality stroller does not have a high quality accessory to go with it. Very much not worth the money. Either buy a generic one, or hold on to your drink and put your stuff in the many available pockets on the stroller."
4,BOB Console Bar for double strollers,"I'm using it on a Baby Jogger City Classic double stroller. Works well. Good storage for small items, like keys, money, and credit cards, etc. Easily to install."
4,a much better collection of karloff movies than a.m.c. offered and better transfers,this set of karloff movies is much better quality than the a.m.c. collection and the transfers are so much better than the other collections.not karloff at his best but still very entertaing and fun to watch.
2,the same thing over and over again - redundant,"The book had a message, and Hesse managed to say that message in so many different useless words of verbiage in all its 80 some pages. The absolute oneness of the universe, the transcendental power of time and space, the 'om' of all people and things: Hesse pounded it into the ground in the last 30 pages while Siddhartha was at the river. The point was gracefully made the first time and did not need to be repeated endlessly. A simple message that I've heard many times, and still no real proof to it...I was disappointed from what I thought would be a good book at the beginning."
3,Hesse is stronger on his own ground,"Having re-read Siddhartha recently, I am still of the opinion that Hesse is very much stronger on his own ground. This particular journey into Eastern literature and mysticism lacks a strong foundation and I do not feel that Hesse is comfortable at all on such distant terrain. Siddhartha is a lacklustre figure by comparison with his European models and I do not think that we (nor Hesse for that matter) can come away from the book with much sense of discovery. There should be the right kind of scene available here for Hesse to show us his ineffable poetic qualities. Somehow he misses the beat, I don't know why, and we are left with a sense of his not having quite established the meaning (that seems nonetheless, to be all around him), in a way for readers to understand. It may be that I fell in love with a Western Hesse too soon, which I did, but I do not see the magic, and certainly not the Hesse magic, in this, of all his novels."
2,"A great novel, but get a different edition!","I'm a German teacher, and this is one of the most-loved books ever, but the translation in this particular edition is outdated and full of errors. (For example, the ""sallow wood"" in the first sentence is an outright mistake on the translator's part, it's really supposed to be a ""forest of sal trees"" - that's a kind of tree that's common in India.) There are a few more recent translations out there that are better. I like the one by Susan Bernofsky best, but there are others to pick from as well."
5,A Life Directing Book - recommended For Young Readers,"I read this book, which I found among piles of best sellers in my families house, when I was fairly young. I didn't even realize it was about Buddha; but I felt that it changed my life, redirected my life, to a certain extent. Over the years I have reread it several times.I couldn't recommend any other book as strongly as I would recommend *Siddhartha* for young readers."
1,"Beautiful novella, but this edition is unreadable due to many, many typos","By all means, buy the book, it's incredible, but don't buy this one. Hesse's words and W.K. Marriott's classic translation are butchered in this Simon & Brown printing -- ""if"" for ""of"", ""nit"" for ""not"", ""heard"" instead of ""head"" -- all in one paragraph. Yeesh."
4,This was a very interesting-revealing book.,"I found this book to be very interesting, wrapping a marvellous tale quite adeptly around delicate philosophical ideas. This is a great book to read to broaden your philosophical horizons."
3,The Search for Enlightenment,"Many people follow Siddhartha's journey in their quest for enlightenment. But as Siddhartha tells Govinda in the end the book how he found his, I feel kind of the same way when it comes to our own personal journey. I don't really feel that the story is that great, it does have all of the elements of the hero's journey, but from the beginning of the story I just found Siddhartha completely pompous and annoying. I can see why so many people enjoy the book, I do but it just wasn't for me I suppose."
4,Informative and exciting,"For those of you who are religous I challenge you to read this book more than others. This book of a Buddist man with a Hinndu father who shows his own take on religion. Although I myself am not very religious, I found this book to be most interesting and informative. Siddartha starts as an avarage kid looking for an answer and chooses to find it in his own way. His persoality and actions change many times throughout the book until he believes he has found the truth. This is a good story of life as Siddartha goes from aestetic to materialistic to Buddist. This is an excellent story while being most informative of basic principals to differnet religions. I recommend this book to anyone interested in learning general knowledge of religion."
5,a book that is truly free of all faiths,"the last thing this book is about, i find, is buddhism. buddhism, zen, indian culture, what have you, are all completely besides the point here. it could have been about an apache in america, a rebellious christian monk in italy, or a lost zulu in africa. it is about the need to search for truth without any preconceived notions. the most important part, i felt, was siddhartha's refusal to follow the buddha and find his own way. here was someone who had completed the journey he was making, and he still needed to know on his own, which, as the book concludes, is the key to all truth. his greatest successes are not in meditation and spiritual pursuits, but in living life and learning from it.quite a lesson"
5,Siddhartha,This is a fantastic book and should be read in high school class along with Catcher in the Rye and Of Mice and Men. I know my children will be reading it.
1,Dang English Teachers!!!,A pox on every English department and English Instructor that pushed this book on me every year in High School and in College and withheld GK Chesterton from me only to discover him years after my academic career ended. A POX ON ALL OF YOU!!!!
1,The Perfect Cure For Insomnia,"When I first read this book as a junior in high school, I though I would die from boredom. Don't get me wrong, I loved English and enjoyed most of the other ""classics"" we were assigned to read; from Shakespeare to Vonnegut to Salinger to Steinbeck.Fast forward 25 years and my son was assigned this book in his AP English class and I thought I would give it another try. Maybe as a more mature and experienced adult, I would enjoy it. Nope. It is still the same 160 page sleeping pill. To each, his own."
3,The Charm is actually good.,"The Charm is another follow up of 2001's album dark days, bright nights, bubba does it again with better songs (although I Hated miss booty) and better writing skills and better production.Bubba Sparxxx has charm, then most white rappers these days and he has ability to make a good album, I Hope he continues to go into that road.Thumbs Up for Me."
4,For Competent Singers,"I really like this method book for expanding the flexibility and range of the voice.It should be used by people who really can sing and have excellent pitch matching AND BREATHCONTROL, not with beginners of any sort or elementary to middle school kids. It is my recommendationto use with high school age talent and older. The CD's are helpful and clearly understood.The price is right and it is good to listen to the CD's completely before using them witha student. If you are buying this for yourself, I would advise getting a voice teacherwho can work with you unless you know how to sing properly."
3,Sing when your winning,"Strip away the superstar love-in material, and this is still a great way to learn to sing. The book gives all the necessary information and the exercises really work, and pretty quickly too.I also bought the Seth Riggs American Idol Singers advantage package and found that I used this book in combination with those CDs, (they are compatible).Go Seth Go..................."
4,SLS is the only way,"First of all, I don't know what that reviewer is talking about with Madonna and vocal nodules. Nodules are produced by continuous abuse of one's voice and definitely not by speech-level singing. In fact, the SLS concept of ""head voice"" and ""mix"" registers are methods to PREVENT vocal nodules. If you take your chest voice all the way up to the high notes (if you can), then you will cause permanent damage to your vocal cords. Either Madonna is not using the techniques correctly, or she is just abusing her voice. Though I will say that Seth Riggs assumes too much of the reader's knowledge about singing. The reason he doesn't overemphasize about breathing with the diaphram is because this book was written for those who have an idea about singing. The ABSOLUTE vocal beginners will be overwhelmed. Other than that, SLS is a brilliant singing method and is the only method worth pursuing."
2,Don't bother with this!,"This figure comes from the line of historical figures, such as 'Moses' or 'Motzart', which have weak durability. This one especially; the only articulation is in the arms, which, I might add, become unhinged after being moved a few times. The golden crook barely fits in the hand and the headdress easily falls off. I advise that no one spends the price listed for this lame figure."
4,Lovecraftiana for the new millenium!,"This is a solid collection for Lovecraft fans. Although there are some real terrors in this book, many of the stories are written with tongue firmly placed in cheek, which is refreshing. ""The Big Fish"" for example, with it's Cthulhu Noir style, was a lot of fun. High points include ""The Barrens"", ""His Mouth Will Taste of Wormwood"", ""Black Man With A Horn"" and ""The Last Feast of Harlequin"". Many of the titles can be found in other compilations, but there is enough fresh meat mixed in with the classics to be satisfying. Finally, for all you aquarium owners, get this book for Peter Blaylock's ""The Shadow on the Doorstep"". It is a short romp into paranoia and tropical fish collecting by a master fantasist. Great story!"
4,"Overall, an excellent read.","This anthology really has some great stuff to offer. A notable exception is Poppy Z. Brite's disappointing ""His Mouth Will Taste of Wormwood,"" which, frankly as far as I could tell had little or nothing to do with the Mythos, and it is certainly not one of her best works in general. In the humorous department, ""Love's Eldritch Ichor"" by Esther M. Friesner is great fun, with many of your favorite Great Old Ones yukking it up in a New York hotel room. The stars of the show here are ""The Barrens"" by F. Paul Wilson, T.E.D. Klein's ""Black Man With a Horn,"" and ""Shaft Number 247"" by Basil Copper, along with great contributions from Ramsey Campbell, Harlan Ellison, Roger Zelazny, and 10 others. Definitley worth reading."
3,OK but not what I expected,"The stories in this book were in general rather dissappointing. There were a few good ones, but for the majority of stories were average at best. Very few of the stories were ""modern"" like I expected; nothing really about how the mythos has influenced our current lifestyle."
5,Human League excellent concert dvd,"As a fan of The Human League for many years owning this dvd is special. Phil, JoAnne, and Susan do the real deal, when they do a live show they are singing live, not faking it with machines like many new acts do. I was very pleased to watch them do some of my favorites Mirror Man, Hard Times, The Lebanon, Human, and The Sign. I have yet to see them live in person, someday I will till then, this is good enough. For Human League Fans around the world for sure buy this dvd, I also liked that they did songs of their latest album, Credo, Electric Shock, ect. Human League is a class act that stands the test of time, something we cannot say about the majority of what is on today's music scene."
5,A Great Book,"Tara Lipinski not only told the interesting story of her life in this book, but it tell and explains a lot about figure skating. I admire all that she has done for her skating. She is one of the best."
1,What to say....,"Well lets just say, I would leave this book off your wishlist if I were you. I was very excited to read it as it was the first Stake your destiny book I've read. It sort of ruined them for me. It was terrible. The dialogue was bad, and made all of the characters seem stupid and annoying. The plot was poorly thought out, and the action sucked. I wouldn't purchase it if I'd read it before hand, and I collect Buffy books."
2,Wrong size,"Regarding 1 of Nylon 6/6 Flat Washer, DIN, M5, 5.30mm ID, 11.00mm OD, 1mm Thick (Pack of 100). I ordered 4 packages of them. Unfortunately, all of them were .033"" thick, not 1mm. .033"" is .84mm. If thickness matters(*wink*), which in my case it did, double check your received product.-Very inconvenienced"
5,"as described, perfect!",I was looking for a nylon washer to use with M2.5 screws and these were perfect. I used them for my analog modular (eurorack) instrument. They could've been a little thicker/wider but they turned out fine.
4,Handle is very handy,Holds all sizes of bagels. cleans easily. Handle makes holding slicer in place without struggling. cuts cleanly & neatly. Fits in cabinet without taking up to much space by turning it on its side
5,awesome!!!!,This book really opened by eyes about christ and my faith. I would reccomend this book to anyone who isn't sure of what to believe in. This book transformed me and i know it will for you too. I can't wait to read the Case for Faith. It is sure to be just as inspirational. Lee is an awesome writer and really words everything well so it is very easy to understand. check it out!
4,Even Better than the one with young Pavarotti,"The singing here is good. So is the orchestra. The setting and acting too. The recorded sound and effect are all excellent. My only reservation is with Gilda. When she sings on her own, she is perfect. When she comes to two part or contrapuntal music, she is equally fine: but the the overall effect is not quite my cup of tea-- but that is of course only a matter of personal taste.On the whole, the quality of this DVD is more modern and colourful and compact and as such, on the whole, even better than the one with young Pavarotti, save and except the part of Rigoletto."
3,Original but a bit misleading.,"It's good to try to explore different aspects of such transcendent people as Leonardo Da Vinci, but I think Michael White stressed it up a little too much. Personally I think Leonardo was not a scientist, he was an incredibly talented heuristic, but that doesn't make him a scientist, a genius maybe (which I certainly believe he was). The book has a good pace and writing style, besides it has some interesting original figures that complement well with the text. As a whole, the book is an interesting one, but I wouldn't recommend it if this is going to be the only one you're reading about Leonardo Da Vinci."
4,A Great Work about A Great Man,"Leonardo Da Vinci is one of the reasons we have so many of the scientific, medical, and artistic principles that we use every day. Though I have always enjoyed Da Vinci's work as an artist, I have only known briefly of his accomplishments as a person who kept pushing the boundaries of what makes our world and our human physiology work. This book only highlights his vision as a artist, but allows the reader who might be an artist to better understand the role that human anatomy played in his work. White is an excellent writer, making this very complex and fascinating man come to life for a new century."
5,If you are searching for some kind of answer,"I found this book several years ago, at a time in my life when I was unsure about what to believe in. I had certain beliefs on what afterlife, but I was still searching. I came upon this book because of the author, and I have to say that this book not only changed my outlook on relationships, it changed my life, period. I found myself not only understanding current and past relationships I had had, but WHY I chose them. It made me have a completely different understanding on those I loved or disliked. It also gave me the realisation that hate was a useless emotion.Although this book doesn't hold ALL the answers, it supplies the reader with the means by which they can heal old wounds, and learn that LOVE is the only answer. When I have a friend or loved one that is searching for answers, I gift them this book."
4,Practical guide,"I have just started reading this book and thus far have found it absolutely fascinating, not to mention enlightening."
2,broke,Was cool for a while... the pre programmed sounds are great but the only way to talk is to record your voice and then play your recording which i thought was rediculous... After about a month of use it broke. there is better stuff out there
2,Still waiting for the funny parts,"This movie does not live up to the hype or its 4 star status. What was so funny? I kept waiting and waiting and waiting. Another thing that really bugs me is that the monkey only comes in for the final 15 minutes. I thought he'd be in it the whole time. Not at all. They bill it like he's hanging out the whole time. I have no idea what the Unrated deal is all about. There is nothing very over the top. The pastry scene in Van Wilder is 100 times crazier than anything here. Seriously minimal nudity. Only 1 chick! This is all marketing and not enough humor. Nice try, but it just didn't do it for me."
5,Instant Classic,How can you not own this? This is probably the most quoteable movie of all time. Adam Sandler's best produced movie.
1,Season 7 down the drain,"I love American Dad. The writers and producers have done a great job with seasons 1-6. It's funny, whimsical, and has good plot lines. But that comes to a crashing halt with season 7. They have completely disregarded the previous six seasons of character development and have turned the show into nothing more than a bad joke. Season 7 is the most insulting thing I have seen in this series. It seems as though they have put more into the animations than story lines and wit. Previous seasons have been stellar, but this season is a waste of time and money. Any time an animated series brings an actual person and more songs than dialog into an episode it's time to stop. Unimpressive and stupid. If you enjoyed seasons 1-6 stop there. The only thing that's funny is that this show can keep going at this rate."
4,Satisfied,"When I first watched Season 2 of the cosby show, I started laughing so hard especially when Peter, Rudy's friend has to go to the dentist. It was just so halarious when peter goes to hide in Rudy's Room under her covers and Cliff comes up to see if peter is there to have him get ready for the dentist. Out of that whole season I watched that particular episode the most."
1,This book is to Science what Karaoke is to Opera,"I'm a mathematician by trade and I feel this book grossly misrepresents what we mathematicians do and where we're going. Why he does this, on purpose, or due to ignorance, is irrelevant. You're asked to cough-up your heard earned dollars to listen to Pavarotti, but once you open its covers you'll find yourself in a Karaoke bar with a guy who thinks he's Pavarotti, because his friends told him so."
4,Stocking Stuffer,This Moisturizing shower gel made a good stocking stuffer. It smelled good and was just as advertised and arrived quickly.
4,John Pawson Works,"If you appreciate that ""less is certainly more..""..then you'll love this book.John Pawson's works continue to demonstrate that there is beauty even in the simplest of expressions.The use of bold planes, subtle lighting and texture continue to seduce and excite.Pawson's kitchens exemplify his minimalist philosophies-they make you want to rip your own out and start all over again!"
3,Question,Which is the diameter of the ferrules? is the screw? I need ferrules 13 mm of diameter without screw and 1inch long.
3,"Not their best, by any means","but ""S.F. Bar `63"" is a terrific rock song. Perhaps my favorite dada song. How many times have I found myself singing ""Please can I kiss your kneecaps""?"
1,Cheap Junk,Broke within a few weeks after purchase. Bite the bullet and pay full price at your cell phone store.
4,Remember,"I liked the story line, good people with real problems. Sometimes it is more realistic for people's problems to be left unresloved because that is the reality of life. I believe that Jesus is the answer and we begin our journey with truth when we know Him. Overall I would recommend this novel for anyone seeking the answers for a trule fulfilled life and open to God's truth."
1,Could put it down and did,"While I enjoyed the first book of this series and intend to read the remaining, I was entirely disappointed with ""Remember"". Am I the only one out there tired of 9/11 rehash? Along with that came the author's ""in your face"" political views which I normally try to ignore but in this book were interjected so often it distracted from the story. I literally stopped reading this book 2/3 of the way through. I hope to enjoy the next book as much as the first in the series. This one, however, was not worth reading."
5,Great Story!,The series continues and leaves you on the edge of your seat waiting for the next in the series. I especially loved the references to the emotions attached with those who were firefighters and those who loved the firefighters. Very poignant and well written.
5,wonderful,i love this series so far i cant wait to get the next one....wonderfully written great story line a real page turner!!!
5,Remember,This is an excellent series by Karen Kingsbury with Gary Smalley. It is easy reading and keeps you intrigued from start to finish. Sharing the series with my daughter.
5,Speaker switch works fine,I bought the niles switch to simplify our home audioset-up. Mission accomplished.Only minor nit is the minor pops duringswitching.
5,use correctly,"the vibrator that comes with this and all vibrating panties, it supposed to go in the pocket for it, or in between the linings most underwear have, its not made to go inside you, its meant as a clitoral stimulant. Thats why its a vibrating panty and not a remote control vibrator."
1,Grudge,"The movie arrived in a timely manner. This movie turned out to be too scary for the family to watch. A note to younger viewers, DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE! To much of the dark side."
2,Waste of film,"To be perfectly honest i'm not all that happy with this film, the first 2 were a whole lot better and more scarier. After i watched the first grudge i was unable to walk in the dark by my self for like 2 weeks. After i got over it i went and watched it again and again couldnt be alone in the dark then when it came out on dvd i bought it. Same went for the 2nd grudge. But this film well lets just say that i was waiting and waiting and waiting and again waiting to be scared out of my skin and well as it happens it didnt and im not afraid to walk alone in the dark. In my opinion this film could have done things alot different and alot better. But you know what this is just my point of view on the 3rd grudge film, others may have liked it alot better than i did. So to be honest dont listen to anyone be your own judge and base your opinion about this film your self. You never know you might like it a whole lot more than other people. Enjoy everyone."
2,Disappointing,"I loved The Grudge and thought The Grudge 2 was pretty good, but this was just disappointing. The story continues with the Chicago apartment from the previous film (which I thought was the weakest part of the film). One cast member returns briefly and everyone else is new or is replaced by a new actor. I loved Kayako in the previous films, but didn't care for her in this film due to the new actress. The plot is pretty boring and at times I wanted to shut the movie off. The film also ends on a cliffhanger, which is likely to never get resolved. There are a couple special features which are pretty boring and a bunch of trailers for other films. I only recommend this film if you really love The Grudge series."
2,Once Too Often To The Well,"I think it's time to lay the Grudge franchise to rest.This 3rd installment is poorly written, poorly acted, re-visits familiar territory and adds nothing to the legacy of the first movie.I found 2 fairly good ""scare"" moments in the film, but that's about it. The first Grudge film managed to be scary throughout by setting a tone and mood. The films since the first one have not been able to capture this eerie feeling.Grudge 3 just doesn't work. It's not scary, the characters are uninteresting and the new pretzel ghost can't hold a candle to the original.I found it funny that the kid ghost is now bigger, taller and has taken to wearing brown shorts. I wonder if he'll be a teenage ghost in the 4th one?The first Grudge is a horror classic as far as I'm concerned. Although the 2nd one was not bad it did not measure up to the first. This 3rd one is a pale imitation. Enough is enough."
1,snake oil for a vulnerable community,"The theme: that nutrition ought to accompany any medical regime, is sound. But the silly sixties warnings about ""processed foods"" and other health food myths make one wonder if this is a book designed to make a buck for the authors rather than to help those with vision problems."
2,Bon Musica,"My daughter has owned two of these shoulder rest and was not pleased. One of the metal pieces on her first model (a full size violin) snapped off. The foam of her second model (the 15"" viola) peeled off and is now completely covered in duct tape. Two other musicians that we have talked to say the same: it's not durable. Both of them have updated to the Wolf, and she will be doing the same."
2,Disappointing,"Started off well but midway through it began to slow and get cumbersome with repetitive detail. It was annoying the way she couldn't speak to him without saying ""Jack"" first. She must have spoken it a thousand times. The conflict between them became too contrived. The age difference between these two was bothersome to me. He was a believably successful (and sexy) man of business at the age of 37. I found her character, at 23 years old, to be too perfect at the start and too whiny and stupid at the end. I usually like Gaelen Foley's tales. Not this one."
2,Can Work - Not Recommended,"Two stars because the ear piece and microphone can work. But if I give it a twist, to reposition the microphone, there is a fifty-fifty chance that the microphone cuts out. Fortunately, with a some more twisting, I can get the microphone to work again. That was my experience.Would recommend searching for an adapter that would offer you a standard 2.5mm jack instead. I found one at [...], but I have not yet tried it."
3,A reasonable balance to Trinquier and Melnik,I'm not sure what the reader comes to Pacification in Algeria expecting. Galula spent his formative years as a junior officer in the Far East looking at the British and American models as an alternate to the French adventure in Indochina (purely my opinion). As a result he cannot be considered representative of the French approach to counterinsurgency. Furthermore he was too junior an officer in an out of the way area in Algeria for his work to be considered an authoritative framework for success. In that regard he is a man out of place and time; not truly indicative of the French approach and not a big enough fish to make a difference with his alternate model. All the same Pacification in Algeria is well worth a read for those professional officers who want to look at one of the source documents for 3-24.If you are looking for historically useful works on the French approach then stick with Trinquier and Melnik.
3,small,I will be traveling cross country and bought this for that purpose. It's smaller than I expected but I will use it as a reference.
5,"excellent, exciting, new, and profound biblical study","Greib reveals, based on scripture, that God is far more loving than most often proclaimed by Christian clergy. Greib offers an image of God that explains all reality. This is the book for the third millennium of Christianity. Greib never appeals to ""mystery"" to explain evil in nature or in man. Greib reveals profound and startling biblical insights into the nature of God. God's love is revealed to be far beyond humanity's fondest dreams and deepest longing."
3,"Great if you've got an army to help you, but..","This book assumes you are a teacher or administrator at a school, and so have the entire support of the staff at your disposal. The art teacher takes care of the sets, the music teacher works on your vocal solos and provides the instrumental portion of your musical. Home Ec teacher does the costumes, etc. Well, sign me up for that educational experience! There is not a lot of practical help in this book. It's mostly about organization and delegation, which, if you're taking on a ""Junior Broadway"", you've probably got already. Better to solicit help from parents of your cast, people who will really care if the production goes well."
4,Midwest dog crate,"Very happy with my order. Arrived as specified. Assembled quickly. No surprises, item was as shown in ad. A little more detail in setup would be helpful.Overall very happy with crate."
4,Quality item,"Really like this item. Easy to use and a comfortable size. Folds up for travel and works like a breeze. Our enclosure, fence, attaches to it easily to allow the dogs to have a little house to rest in when they must be contained. Very pleased."
5,Great Product,"Really happy with the crate, and got it at least $50 cheaper (more in some stores) shipped to me than I could buy it anywhere else. It arrived super quick as well. Beat my other products here."
5,"Easy to assemble, great space",First one we received was damaged during shipment. Amazon quickly shipped a replacement and I sent the damaged one back free of charge. Bought this for our rabbitt since she had outgrown a small version. Lots of space for the rabbitt. Very easy to assemble. Best price found on Amazon!!
5,"It's a cage, it holds my dog.","Works well. I have a part newfie/part blue heeler mix that likes to chew through doors when being kept at friends or relatives houses. He gets very anxious and will chew through doors, which has cost me hundreds of dollars in the past in repairs. This crate kept him from breaking free and he had plenty of room to stretch out and stand up. The crate was quite a bit bigger than I had though. He's about 55 lbs and it was more than enough room. I would definitely recommend this crate. Good quality and the price was much better than similar crates at my local pet store and what I could find on other sites online."
2,Very flimsy,"I bought 4 of these crates in December. I have rottweilers and need a sturdy crate. This is not the crate to use for anything that breathes. I had to re-enforce these crates in six places with stainless steel clips to prevent it from collapsing on itself. A stiff breeze will cause this crate to collapse in on itself. I have bought a lot of different crates over the last 20 years and I have never had to deal with such a poorly designed crate.I thought that Midwest was a reliable brand, but not any more. In the past I have been happy with my Midwest crates. I am very disappointed in the quality of these of these crates. I still have the 42"" crates from General Cage that I bought 16 years ago. I can't imagine these crates making it a fraction of that time. Very disappointing."
4,Midwest Life Stages DBL Door Dog Crate,"I never had success getting the divider to fit well so had to use separate kennels until River fit into this, but now that he does its a huge peace of mind knowing he's safe when I'm gone!"
4,Easy Set Up,"I'm getting a new puppy in about 3 weeks and saw this crate when I was shopping for puppy supplies. I ordered the 36x24x27 with the Free Super Saver shipping and had the crate in about a week and a half after ordering. Right out of the box all you have to do is pull up longer sides and then pull the shorter sides and snap into place (watch you fingers though!). The only complaint I have is the plastic tray had one of its edges broken off when I received it, but that may have happened in the shipping process (we all know how UPS treats their packages sometimes). Other than that, the crate is the perfect size for a bed (and piddle pad when I'm not home before housebreaking). My little Sheltie will love it :)."
4,Great product.,I've heard a lot of great things about this crate and found it be the cheapest on Amazon.com.It seems very sturdy and works well for puppies to grow in. Right now my lab is only 15 weeks old and she's about 9 lbs...but I know within the next couples mouths she's going to grow pretty quickly. It's nice to know that I won't need to buy another crate and can just use this same one. The price is great - better than you'll find at petsmart or petco (these in other brands run about $100 each).I'm happy with the product overall.. It's functional and well built.
1,Not a long lasting crate...unhappy puppy!,"My puppy escaped from this the first night I had her! I ended up having to padlock the sides together to prevent her getting out. If you have a placid dog this might be ok, but my puppy HATED this thing. I would come home after 3 hours and she would have a bleeding nose because she was trying so hard to get out.She also urinated in it every day without fail, despite my walking her, taking her out and frequently going home to let her out. The crate rusted and left stains on my carpeting.I have switched to an enclosed, plastic airline crate and she no longer urinates, doesn't escape and is much, much calmer. Spend the money to get a decent crate upfront, it will ease the house training process and ensure a MUCH happier dog!"
3,Disappointed,"We have only had this for 4 days and our newly adopted dog has managed to unhook the piece that is supposed to hold the plastic tray in place and slide the tray out of the crate. Unfortunately for us, tonight (the second time) she unhooked it, slid the tray about 1/2 out and started lifting on it until she had it all broke up. Since we have camera on her, we saw the whole thing go down but were too far away from home to do any good. Within 15 minutes, she had the half remaining in the crate completely destroyed.If you buy this unit, I HIGHLY recommend using something to secure the hook so it cannot be released. She did it by pressing and biting against the end of the crate until it came unhooked. If I can find a replacement tray, I plan to try zip ties. Hopefully, she won't be able to get her teeth on it well enough to break them."
4,Great Value!,"The crate came pretty quickly and it was as described. My dog loves this thing! It's sturdy enough, too. If you've got some nut-job dog that will try to eat its way out, this may not be the crate for you, but it's fine for a ""normal"" dog. For the money, this is a great crate."
5,Very versatile crate,"We have a 43lb. American Eskimo that we bought this for. We didn't know how he'd react to a crate so we started right off making it a ""happy"" place. We tell him to ""go to his bed"" if it's treat time and he goes right in the crate now. We also plan on using it in the back of our SUV for long car trips. The 2 doors makes for an easier time trying to find a place in your house to put the crate. A great buy as well...much less expensive than purchasing at a pet store."
4,Excellent Product,"We bought the 42"" crate for our black lab. He weighs about 100 lbs and had far outgrown his previous crate that was only 34"". We decided to get this crate because of the price and because of the option side or front doors. It feels very durable. The pull out tray liner is really nice as well. We would highly recommend this crate to anyone."
3,Does the job...,"This crate is a great value, the divider is especially helpful as the puppy grows, and was really easy to put up. THIS WOULD NOT BE A GOOD CRATE IF YOUR dog is not calm in the crate, you would definitely need a sturdier crate if that were the case. It's perfect for me though, I will not need another."
3,Good Basic Crate,This Midwest Life Stages crate is a good basic crate. I needed one a little larger for one of my whippets. My other 2 crates are the Midwest I-Crate series with the same double door. The I-Crate series is much more sturdy with a heavier gauge wire. This may be important to some buyers who might have a heftier dog or for people like me who travel with their dogs. We have to stack them in our RV. This series are not very sturdy. The I-Crate is a little more expensive but it is worth the difference in price. The double door is a huge convience because you can move them locations with out worry about door access.
5,Dog crate,"Was surprized by the size but know my dog will grow in to it. Use it in the car and my dog loves it. In retrospect, would buy the 3 door model so I could have greater access from either side of the car. Easy to secure to the car ( bought 3 padlocks: 1 for securing to the car and 1 for each door). Now we BOTH feel safe and secure!"
5,Huge help in Potty Training!,"Aside from giving our new dog a place of refuge this was a great instrument in potty training. He now has the hang of going out side to do his business. Since he is on the skidish side of the fence when it comes to meeting new people it has helped with that as well. He now enjoys lounging on his bed. I recommend this to anyone that needs help with potty training. Of course, you will need to get some assistance on exactly how that will work on other websites out there. Also make sure you have enough space for you dog. If you have a puppy this comes with a divider for the crate to give the puppy a smaller space to start with and room to grow into the crate as they get older."
5,Great product,I purchased this cage for my dog. The price was excellent on Amazon. A similar cage at a national brand name pet store was over $90. This cage is great. It's sturdy and has 2 openings on the cage. I would recommend this product to any pet owners looking to replace or purchase one for the first time. I very happy with this cage and I think you will to.
5,"i would give this 6 stars if possible a year an 1/2 of bulldog abuse, still like new...","great pen!! I have a large bulldog who is tough on cages,, she hasnt budged this one,, absolutely the bast deal I found for the money... and the company rocks,, mine came with a small crack in the plastic floor,, they sent me another, no questions asked.. no pictures,, nothing,,, thats service!!update,, 7-6-11,,, still like new, dog is in it every day,, and she beats it when somebody comes over or she hears strangers,,,, this is one awesome cage,,,,"
4,Pet Crate,At first I thought it would be to big for my small puppy/ dog since we thougth the rescue dog we were getting was maybe bigger ..but once we added the divider it was perfect . I like it because it gives my husband and I room and all his dog toys in it while he grows up and once we cover the top it like a little cave ...After 3 weeks Watson goes in the crate by himself to sleep .. Any tips on how you can stop the barking when we have to leave him the crate for a few hours would be great ..He is 5 months old Terrier mix
4,Functional good value,"After researching lots of crates this seemed a popular choice with high average ratings. I haven't been disappointed - the crate is sturdy and strong. It is heavier than I imagined, and I therefore don't move it - ever. I also would not fold it flat for travel unless I really had to, as I trapped my fingers painfully when I originally erected the crate. One of the 2 doors is not aligned well, making it stiff to slide the locking levers. At some point I'll probably fix that myself. All round a good strong product that we've had no major issues with, and my dog is very happy to sleep inside!"
3,Buy togeather package a rip off,"This item: Midwest Life Stages Double-Door Folding Metal Dog Crate, 36""L x 24""W x 27""H by MidwestMidwest Quiet Time Pet Bed, Fleece, 42"" x 26"" by MidwestFURminator Large Yellow deShedding Tool with 4-Inch Edge by FURminatorI was looking to buy a crate and saw this, below it says ""buy all three and save"" It was for the crate, the sheepwools matt for the crate, and the Furmiator. It arrived and the matt is WAY to big for the crate, wrong size entirely. I thought it was just a mistake but rechecked on line and NONE of the matts offered in a group deal are the same size as the crates.... now I have a way to big matt that doesnt fit my crate! Not very smart!"
3,"Good product, but is it safe?????","Again as with the bed pad that goes with this crate, I found out after assembly that this crate is made in China! I mean nothing about that in the advertisement, the name is ""Midwest"", one would think, Hmmm, product of USA. Nope. So I bought this for our 12 week old puppy who is filling it up rapidly. The divider was usable for the first two weeks. My concern with the made in china is that she's a puppy and loves to chew on stuff, including the crate. So is the black paint that's on this thing safe or lead toxic? Obviously, since China doesn't care what they sell us stupid Americans, who knows what it is. I'm hoping she grows out of the chewing stage before she grows a second head. Damn Amazon. Get on the band wagon here and take your eye off the $$$ for a minute and give us quality, safe, products at reasonable prices. I'm going to try and really search out the makers of your products before ordering or stop buying from Amazon."
5,Just what we needed.,We needed a crate large enough for our basset hound.The door on the front works great for in house or car(hard to turn corners with long dog). We are very happy with the quality & workmanship.
3,Works well for the price,I purchased this crate as a back up for my 4 boston terriers. It works well for the price. Only suggestion is the walls do come out of the hinges easily. If you intend to use this on a permanent basis (no folding it up for storage) I would suggest that you clamp down the hinges. Would also suggest buying the optional wheels while you are at it. (will save you the pain of dragging the crate). Shipment was very prompt and the crate was very easy to fold together!
3,Wheels of Fire,"Wheels of FirePage 75 Terry,Paras dont yomp they 'Tab' dont care what you make up about the 'Hats' but i thought you would get that right!Enjoying the book though still reading it...."
3,"Great read, but too much text","This is an excellent guidebook, IF you like to read a book while on vacation. I don't claim to speak for everyone but the last thing I want on my vacation is to have to read loads of text. The book is very well written, one of the best I've owned, but just getting through the long lines of continuous text gets old. The book really needs more photographs and illustrations, and the use of another color besides red would have been nice too. Plus the text is awful small, hard for quick reference.When it comes down to it, if you want to learn a lot about Maui and get all the details, this is the book for you (or Rough Guide Mini for Maui). If you want a tour guidebook for sightseeing, etc without missing any details then I'd recommend Maui Revealed or Maui Mile by Mile. They aren't as wordy, but they are better for travelers on the go.Aloha, Dave"
5,A must have for a Maui trip!,"Great Great book! Frommers are the best travel books, hands down. If your going to Maui, you need this. This book lead us to lots of awesome things that we normally would not have found on our own."
5,Third time's the charm...,"After two previous ""Strange Cargo"" albums, William Orbit finally gets it right; while the previous two were haphazard and uneven, William Orbit seems to have found the right groove with this one. The songs on this CD never get above a dull roar - they are all rather quiet and mellow, and even the more uptempo tracks inspire more of a thoughtful groove than an all-out dance."
4,Great collection of employee accounts of working for AA,"Intersting colloection of stories and everyday anecdotes of the routiney customer service issues to the letter from the passenger who lost her wedding ring on board an aircraft...only to be tracked down months later my mechanics at the maintenace hub in Tulsa after tearing up the floor panels. If you're interested in customer relations or employee morale, this is a great pick."
3,It is a cool book.,Probably the kids who like the Goosebumps series would like this book better than other kids. I've read better books and its kind of easy for me. But I still like it.
2,misleading title,"the title of this book should read: 'the mindset of shareholders in a range bound stock'; in his conclusion, the author wrote,""using an understanding of crowd psychology to enchance trading is actually the subject for a whole new book"". so this book is actually for absolute biginners in the stock market who has no knowledge of technical analysis or its basis. it's a waste of time for anyone who has just a little of insight into trading. the entire book can be found in one section of a good technical analysis book, just look up 'triangles', rectangles, or range bound trading. and their breakouts. the author just describes the thinking behind various individuals in these situations, with much repetitions. it's a wonder i read til the end. the author did recommend some books in the second last page for 'better reading' though. 2 stars for his honesty and stated objectives."
2,Not an item worth buying online,"Go buy it in person at Sephora or something instead- the eyeshadow arrived crushed when I ordered it by mail. Instead of being able to use the colors separately, I got a single color. Ick.That said, I swear by this brand and this dual eyeshadow is my favorite. It has a lovely sheen and very subtle sparkle. Gorgeous!"
1,Buyer beware,"I purchased this shadow duo in Peach Fuzz and Sexpresso and thought what was pictured would be similar to what I would receive. Not at all. The brown is a very dark espresso matte and the peach is a pink/orange with tons of gold glitter. The matte is very difficult to blend and the glitter goes everywhere. Also, the colors are not fused as shown, but in two separate half-pans."
5,Child Of God,"I really think that this book was a terrific book. To me this was a very interesting book I would read this book over and over again.I really dont have a favorite part in this book when u read a book like this u just like the whole book.This book can relate to other peoples life.Like when babies get burned in a house fire,girls having babies by their brothers.Also when a girls boyfriend kill her mother and the girl is more worried about her boyfriend going to jail then her own mothers death.I would really like to read more of these books more often."
5,Now This is a Novel,"Lolite Files really out did herself with this one. This story had everything that you could thing of and more. Incest, voodoo, murder and drugs.Ms. Files bring the characters to life and when reading you feel like you really know the Boten family."
3,"Hated it - a backwoods, gothic mess","It's the kind of material that only Alice Walker or Toni Morrison could get away with and make you love it. And although I love how it shows Lolita Files' growth in not just sticking with urban romance, it's trying to hard and way too nasty. It's a tale of a bunch of incest several times over, suggests that not only can sexuality be inherited directly, but also is caused by being raised around women, causes incest and immorality like it's all riding the same gene. It's a mess of a book and I couldn't put it down. It's so horrible that I read it from cover to finish in one day - engrossing but vile, like a train wreck of Jerry Springer, dressed up in clothes from the past to make it look like Toni Morrison. Gross book, made me want to take a bath afterwards to rid me of the memory. Hoped the ending would be redeeming, but it's a long wild ride for very little payoff. Sorry to be harsh, but the book has way less mercy than I."
4,Great,I loved reading this book. I could not put it down. It highlighted the ills in society and how we would rather hide issues than deal with them. I would read another book by this author.
3,A little too much drama for me...but you might like it!,"I can't really say I didn't like this one...it was okay. It just seemed to me like Ms. Files tried to cram every possible scenario into one book, and it all got a bit overwhelming to me at times. I think I would have liked it better if it had focused more on Ophelia, since she was the most well-developed character in the book. I almost liked Walter, but for his weakness when it came to Sukie. As for Sukie and Lay, they were just too evil to be true, and they both made the story too unbelievable.Overall, this was not a bad novel. It's nothing like Lolita Files other books, which were cute, funny stories but not meant to be anything deep or thought provoking. This one attempts to come off as more literary and serious, but I found it predictable and easy to put aside. I think it just tried to cover too much ground instead of sticking with fewer subjects and characters and exploring them more."
4,"Thanks, Aaron Parrish AKA Jerry ***** author's response","Dear Aaron Parrish (AKA Jerry Creighton),I hope I can return the favor and critique a work of yours someday. I promise that when I do, I will not make it a personal attack. I will try to be fair.I still love teaching, Aaron, and I still do my best every day. I'm truly sorry that you had such a terrible experience in my class. I certainly hope that my poor methods did not land you in a sub-par college.Best of luck,Chris Boone Cleveland"
1,Ugh!,The pieces of this did NOT fit together well...I had to force most of it in and ended up having to use the footboard as the headboard since the measurements and everything was totally off. I would have returned it if I hadn't destroyed the boxes trying to get the dumb things out.
3,Same ole' story,"Found this book VERY repetitive! Was a little let down by that,but in the end a good read. Was hopeing for more behind the scene stories. Maybe ill read his drivers book next."
3,Most Of These Are Available Elsewhere,"The third Living In Oblivion entry becomes a bit common, including several songs that are the stock and trade of every run of the mill 80s compilation. We still manage to find some lesser seen gems, such as ""AEIOU Sometimes Y"" by EBN-OZN and ""Make A Circuit With Me"" by the Polecats, but tunes like ""Sunglasses At Night"", ""Rock This Town"", and ""Shattered Dreams"" are the norm here. Any 80s fan probably already has these songs squirreled away on a variety of other compliations. Not the best in the series."
2,Prog-lite,"Take a weak Geddy Lee wannabe and team him up with a group of Marillion wannabe's (which is ironic since the era of Marillion that these guys are aping is the time that Marillion was a PG era Genesis wannabe), but water down the material to the point of bordering on total schlock and you have Iluvatar. Sure it's melodic, but is it interesting? No."
5,Burr's Great Followup To 'Perry Mason',"Thought a bit crabby and a little chauvinistic, still a great police series. DVD image quality is good. That's all folks."
5,True Bliss,"I heard this CD during a kundali yoga class in Punta Cana. As soon as I returned home, I tracked it down and I continue to meditate and zone out to it. Also a great listen, poolside, it really brings you down to another dimension."
4,Quite good.,"Im mostly writting this review to counteract the insipid and less than insightfull review posted by Robert J. Hickey ""yogibob"". The plot and stoy flow quite well and the action is fun. I found the end to be a bit rushed. As to why Im cammenting on Robert J. Hickey ""yogibob""'s review is because his main complaint was about forgetting the laws of physics. *sigh* This is a FANTASY NOVEL Robert J. Hickey ""yogibob"" . Why not foster your willing suspension of disbelief and enjoy yourself for a change. Must be tough to walk around with that much of a stick up your butt."
2,cheap,"While the product does the job , in my opinion it is really light weight and hard to grip it when lifting it off the table,after racking the balls."
1,Poor,"Before Glass Houses, I had read one Stella Cameron book (The Best Revenge) and although I hadn't been too impressed I decided to give her a second shot. I was *very* wrong to have done so. I slogged my way through GH and ended up skim reading the last quarter of the book so that I could finish and forget about it. Not only was the plot and writing very poor, the characters were trite and cliched. Speaking as an Englishwoman, I was appalled how Olivia was portrayed..."
1,This isn't the one !,"For those of you 60's generation looking for the ""She's Not There"" track, this is the wrong CD. ""She's not there"" although the Vanilla Fudge version is on this CD is not the one you're thinking of. The real deal was done by the Zombies. You'll be disappointed if you purchase this for that track. It's Vanilla Fudge trying to ride the wave on the Zombies coattails, and not doing a very good job of it, either."
1,Awful quality,I love Adidas products but not this one. I wore them 4-5 times and they were all holes. You can buy better quality socks at Walmart.
1,Not good,"I bought two pairs of these socks, and after just a few weeks they all have holes in them. Note that I didn't wear the holes in them, they all eventually just tore (mostly near the heel) after pulling them on. And it's not like I was putting undue force on them while pulling them on either (I guess after 40 years I feel like I know how to pull on a pair of socks), they just fell apart."
1,Terrible Quality,"I actually went looking for reviews of these socks to see if others had the same problem I had. Obviously, this is an issue of terrible quality for an otherwise good brand. I've had many of these socks and, as the other reviewers state, they just plain old fall apart after a couple of wearings. Very comfortable but don't expect to wear them more than 4-5 times."
1,Great....if you like holes!,I loved these socks for about 2 weeks which was just about the time I noticed the holes. I am very disappointed b/c they were very comfortable. All 6 of mine have holes just from normal use. DONT BUY!
5,"Brilliant, A great read","This book is a wonderful mix of excitement and mystery witha tinge of romnce. Wonderfully un-real, this book containsmagic and mystery in the land of Wizards and talking animalsAs Comerone and Medanbar set off to search for Kazul, kingof the dragons, they encounter all sorts of strange thingsand withut knowin it, they fall in love.A wonderful book for all ages."
3,"Nice Chair, but a little low","I bought this chair for my 10 month old daughter who is big for her age. She likes to sit AT the table, so I sometimes use this chair instead of her highchair.It is a nice chair and looks great with our kitchen table. The chair pad is great too because it is plastic instead of cloth, so it wipes off very easily. The neutral pattern works for male or female too.The only problem I see is that when my daughter is sitting in it, the tray is basically on top of her legs so her food is right in her lap area. That means she has to try to get the food in her lap from a longer distance than her highchair.When she is using it without the tray, I think it will be better."
5,Great Read,"I picked this up at a book sale and it was excellent! It's engaging, funny, and beautiful-- I stayed up all night to finish it and suggested it to friends."
4,Pick It Up,"I would of gave it a 5 but I didn't like the ending. This was comedy at it's best. The main character's life - [...] out of carolina - gets worst every chapter. Not much goes in her direction but she tries hard to succeed. She is looking for her true self and where she belongs. Everytime she finds someplace, something happens. She realizes that, that isn't her. Oddly enough she leaves her mark on so many people along the way.Read it, it is ""required lesbian reading""."
4,simply genius,"this is one of the greatest books I have read. you will find delight and sadenss in Molly's story... well, sometimes you think she is very nice and evil in the same time. just read it, you will experience a great time reading her wits. thank's mae brown!"
5,Still remarkable,"With its fold-out cover and photo story booklet inside, ""Wild Is Love"" was an extravagant Capitol project. Issuing an album of all-new music was nearly unheard of at the time and to issue one written as a complete project equally unheard. Capitol had no idea what to expect but the album indeed was a hit and got big radio play. Nelson Riddle's arrangements deserve much credit; he was at his zenith here. Please note that there was NO Broadway production of ""Wild Is Love."" The album was written as an album and there was some consideration of taking it further as the basis for a musical, but there was no such musical ever staged. ""Wild Is Love"" was good enough for Patti Drew to do her own, later, version for Capitol (!) and I believe there was even a third version. Cole also did a T.V. performance of the music complete with the narrative."
3,future artist,"My granddaughter got this for xmas,she enjoyed it well,but there is not enough room to put extra things or arts things to have close by. Other than that it serves its purpose well."
2,Don't expect to create a master piece on this!,"I got this easel at 75% off. It is quite easy to put together and it looks as good as the picture, except ... the drawing board actually comes in two seperate pieces. This makes drawing/ painting in the middle quite impossible."
1,This is [bad],"I can't believe how many good reviews this exceedingly formulaic CD is getting. Not only are the vocals too metal-esque for my taste, but the arrangements and chops are nothing to get excited about. Some of the sections are almost 'hokey' in their effort to be dramatic or to fit into the 'progressive' category. Playing a Hammond, a Mellotron or a Minimoog doesn't necessarily make the music any good (I love all three, btw). After so many new progressive bands have done some truly interesting things, its hard to see why this gets so much attention. I was truly disappointed after having read so many good reviews."
4,Not a great sound-reducer,"I bought these mainly on the basis of the several reviews that recommended it as a remedy for a noisy environment. Unfortunately, it doesn't do any better a job than the cheap Aiwa ones that I got at Wal-Mart.On the other hand, they're very comfortable and seem quite well-built. Sounds quality is fine."
5,The Most Comfortable Headphones I've Ever Owned,"Yes, these headphones SOUND good. It's Sennheiser! Of course it will sound good. What's important about these things, however, is that they are incredibly light and incredibly comfortable. I never realized how comfortable they were until I started using a different headphone and found my ears worn red after only an hour or two of use. This is especially a problem since I wear glasses, and the combination of glasses around my ears and headphones on my ears can be VERY annoying. I have no problem wearing these headphones for several hours at a time, even with my glasses on. If you use headphones a lot, you want headphones that sound good and feel good. That's the 2200!"
3,Great while they lasted.,"I disregarded bad reviews, figuring the reviewers to be clumsy and/or abusive to the product. After taking the utmost care with these headphones for years now, they're suddenly losing sound. I have to wiggle the wire to get sound on the right side, but that only works so long as I don't move. Still, the sound was amazing while it lasted, but that's also a drawback. The quality is so good for closed 'phones that deprivation of their sound is irritating.I've ordered the wire with the hopes that will fix my problem, but I've added a pair of HD280s to my cart to be safe. I'm reviewing this mainly to inform people--especially those prone to dropping things--to look elsewhere when buying a used headphone. These were discontinued for a reason."
4,Just as expected,"Everything fit my PIS original perfectly and it was just as described. I love that it comes with the sanitation bags! The only thing that would make this set better is if the flanges and shields were separate pieces, but I knew from the other reviews that this was not the case so I am not disappointed by any means."
5,Thought you should know...,"I wanted to make sure that every mom who wanted to purchase this knows that the horns themselves are all one part. They are not the removable part ones that come with the newer pumps. So if you are a mom that needs bigger or smaller shields than the standard that came with your pump, don't get this.Besides that, the parts are identical and work great."
3,Cheaper if bought separately,"The micro steam bags are awesome. It is very helpful to have more breast shields. However, you can buy these cheaper separately. The bottles cost $19. The shields and valves are $7 each. (I purchased the shields at a local Target.) The micro steam bags are $4 and you get 4 in a package. (My local Target charged a couple dollars more for the steam bags than Amazon does.) That's $37."
5,Very Nice,This pacifier is for my baby on the way and I find it very nice. I like it very much and it's attractive ;o)
4,Thank you,"Glad that I bought this product. Helps out instead of having to immediately wash anything that I use it gives me a little bit of freedom between taking care of my newborn and dishes. I do wish that this set came with nipples though, which is the only reason that I don't give the product itself 5 stars."
5,What I asked for!,"Everything was what I expected, worked properly and fit accordingly with my madela, hospital grade, pump. I don't use the bags for steam cleaning though, I just use the dishwasher and it holds up fine."
1,small breast shield,kit comes with the small breast shield attached to the connected so it cannot be changed for the the larger size
3,Entertaining Read,Worth your time to read this volume which is early in the Hillerman ouvre. Not his best but more than readable.
3,TOO SMALL!,"I bought this thinking it was a great deal, until it arrived and I realized the book was only about 3.5 inches tall! Don't be fooled- get the big book for [...] bucks. This book would be amazing if the pictures were big enough to see!!"
1,TOO SMALL! Not worth it because the awesome details are lost,The First time i saw this book i fell in love with it- but that was the big size version that i have been unable to find on anywhere! It is a wonderful collection of images but because of it's small size a great deal of the details are lost. This small size in this book is not worth purchasing unless it is just for a table topper.
2,This device has many problems,"Issue #1 - The first week I had this phone it would not charge even though it was plugged in. I discovered I have to plug it in, unplug it, and then plug it in again to get it to charge.Issue #2 - The letter S on the keyboard works about half the time.Issue #3 - Terrible Sprint Customer service. I spent hours on hold and being switched around. I never spoke to anyone who could help me.The only thing I like about this device is the size. Do yourself a favor and get the Palm or a Blackberry."
3,Bad product as well as bad service provider,"This phone is so-so in everything. They advertise 3.5-4 hours of battery, but seems like you have to turn off every damn feature to get that battery life. Used it for 1 month and returned it. Doesn't come with many features of Windows Mobile, like office. Motorola made this phone, so feature less, that you can't adjust the brightness of the screenThe processor seems to be real slow, windows media player takes a while to even come up when you click open.Apart from this, Sprint is hell, their customer service is pathetic, and take long hours. They are arrogant, unhelpful, dumb. Welcome to the real world :)"
2,View from Sprint employee,my cousin works at Sprint and she physically fixes phones that come in for repairs and returns. She has been telling me about how many times she's seen this phone (Moto Q) come in to be fixed or returned. She said that it was built to compete against the Blackjack and so it was made quickly and has a lot of bugs. Maybe in a year it will be a great phone after all of the bugs in the software are fixed and updated. I just want people to know who want this phone that it was made in a hurry for competition and I was advised NOT to buy it as a smart phone... the Palm Treo is way better ( i DO have one of those).
4,"Pleasant nuevo flamenco/gypsy style guitar, but not a stand out","If you're familiar with the music of Jesse Cook, Esteban, Ottmar Liebert, Govi, Oscar Lopez, et. al. then you have an idea of what this music is like.The first track, ""Batucaje (Baiana),"" has some very repetitive sections. The second cut, ""A Mis Abuelos,"" starts off with a more authentic flamenco sound.The problem with ""Diamante"" is that while it's very pretty music, it's in the same nuevo flamenco/gypsy style that Narada was specializing in a decade ago. It's very nice to listen to, but I didn't hear anything that made it stand out from fifty other nuevo flamenco/gypsy guitar albums.3.5 stars."
2,Wanted It To Work Out,"When Enfamil's direct competitor's formula was constipating my newborn son, I was forced to find another formula for him. Instantly, I thought of the Enfamil brand, and ran out to purchase some cans for my baby. Wow! Now he had diarrhea. The diarrhea didn't end until I stopped giving him the Enfamil."
4,The Newtonian Casino,"It's a revolutionary book in the sense that the way of thinking before they challenged the roulette was that to beat the roulette was impossible, even Einstein had that opinion. They demonstrated the opposite, it was and STILL IS POSSIBLE TO BEAT THE ROULETTE.José"
4,liked the movie,"good kids movie , purchased for my granddaughter she enjoyed watching it with me , recommended for family viewing ,"
2,Not really for little kids,Rented this for my three yr old she watched it but didnt really like it its about a girl who is really mean ans selfish that turns in to a dog to show her humility.
3,Good Product,"These headphones are good but, if you are looking for the top of the line headphones then you might want to try some of the companies later models that have more features. They are really good for the purpose that they serve and I am really enjoying my pair"
3,Burton's Quotes Save the Day,This is an interesting biography abd worth reading with a grain of salt. Brodie's real saving grace is the great excerpts used from Burton's books that are not longer in print or available in most libraries.I found the author tried to evaluate and judge a 19th Century man by 20th Century standards. It is a pycho eval. I have little faith in this 60s fad. See Farwell and Rice's bios for a more balance approach. Evaluations are hard enough to on the living and even more dificult on the dead. I feel Brodie failed to do a fair job. Brodie let 1960s attitudes jaundice this biography making it quite dated.
5,Crowd pleaser,"Even my lazy cat loves these toys. He really digs his claws into them, and he seems to enjoy the smell, too. They're not super-durable--he bunnykicks the stuffing out of them within a month or 2--but that's a sign of how much he loves them. When he picks a toy for himself (yes, he has a toy bin), it's inevitably one of these mice.Another bonus: they're not fur. Sure, cats may be obligate carnivores, but I can't think of a good reason why their toys need to be made of fur from raccoon dogs. Plus, my cat seems to prefer the feel of burlap. I suspect other mice are made of fur in order to please the humans, not the cats..."
5,300 Paper-pieced Quilt Blocks,"the book is really good.. and very intersting.. i recommend it for anyone who loves doing things by themselves.. my aunti used it to make her grandchildren their quilt... so its more than a quilt for them now.. its a quilt from their grandma.it arrived on time, which gave me the chance to take it back home and show it to all of my friends and families"
1,Not Impressed,"I was very disappointed with the blocks in this book. They were unsophiticated, unimaginative and mostly geometric with very few picture blocks."
3,Pretty Good,"I acctually liked this one a lot, it's got pretty decent vibration and the pearls feels good, but it's not the ideal material because it's really sticky feeling.The catching is the second time I used it, the vibrator broke! When I checked to see what happened the wires had broken and I wasn't even being harsh with it. I really wanted it more for the vibrator then the pearls."
4,The Master's Versions,"This is some of the best dub music to be found anywhere. King Tubby, master (and inventor!) of most of the tricks of the dub trade, showcases his talents as he mixes down some roots gems... the resulting dub tracks are tremendous in both their raw power as well as in their texture and subtlety. Vocals, guitars, and hi-hats are deftly woven in and out of tracks built upon a solid foundation of rich, deep bass and drums that are at times punchy, other times ""wet""-sounding they reverberate so much. For those who really get into it, I'd recommend ""Jesus Dread"" by Yabby U: most of the tracks on ""Prophesy"" appear here in their vocal/original versions (with other versions included featuring a veritable who's-who of Dub & Roots artists and producers)."
5,What is love ?,"Like many people, I want to know what love is..But if you don't know what it is, how would you recognisedit when it presents itself ?In his book, Krishnamurti suggest a simple method.Do not seek love, instead look at each individual feelingsthat you have and ask yourself is this love or is this a pathto love ? Do not judge but simply observe. just patiently lookand let it reveal itself.Love is not attachment, nor is it detachment.Love does not contain fear nor is it pleasure.There is beauty in love,There is freedom in love,There is understanding in love,When you have removed ""ALL"" feelings/concepts/ideas which arenot love, then what remain must be love.This is only my observations, and I encourage you to find yourown."
1,Don't waste your money!!!!,"Bought these for my son thinking how convenient they are. Tried them for the first time and neither one of these fit the ""brand name"" water bottle I had. I ended up spilling most of the water just trying to get the cap on. I will def be returning these!!!"
2,surprise,"Everything was ok I received the product early than I expected but the only bad thing that I noticed is that I couln'd find an expiration day in the bottle, so this is very suspicious cuz I don't know if I'll be taking somethimg that it is out of date.Only for that he gets only 2 stars."
1,More McSweeneys MFA Assignments,"I just barely made it through this book. I would have put it down, but I figured the rave reviews might have some merit. They didn't. The protagonist is shallow and self-conscious, and the novel lacks the subtlety of similar works--the prose was so pomo that I was thinking Vida is a pen name for David Foster Wallace--only it lacks David Foster Wallace's well-developed characters and interesting plots. Wait for it to show up in paperback, or browse through it at Borders."
2,And Now You Can Go,"Perhaps Ms. Vida's main character Ellis is blowing the incident with the gunman a bit out of proportion. I understand the scenario was disturbing, but I found Ellis's huffing and hawing about the event for some one hundred odd pages tiresome and annoying. And Now I Will Go."
5,Highly Recommend,"This is a good book. It's very companionable, and the writing is straightforward and elegant both. I like it a lot."
5,A Gotta Read Book,This book is one of my favorites now. I would recommend this book to anyone. I can not wait for the sequel. Kevin really took the reader to the streets in NY. I could just vision the scenes.Keep it up.One of your Dayton Fans
3,What is it about the Saddle Club?,I bought this as a gift for my sister who LOVES the Saddle Club. She loved it and for some reason the movie sucked me in too. I mean it's kind of an interesting show to begin with and what girl didn't dream of owning her own pony when she was little? The acting is not the most awesome but then again it's a kid's show:)
4,For the money...,"Really, how much can you ask for at this price?This is a neat little CD player which actually sounds pretty good. It offers four different modes: repeat (all tracks or just one), random, program and intro. The headset that comes with it works OK, but I had another Sony headset which I use instead and I get pretty good sound quality. It also comes with an AC adapter or you can use 2AA batteries (not included)It doesn't have any kind of buffer or shock protection, so if you nudge it a little too hard it will skip. But as long as you don't plan on taking this jogging you should be OK.I bought this to use at work with headphones for three reasons: 1. So I wouldn't have to bother anyone else with my music 2. I didn't want to use my computer's CD drive 3. I didn't want to spend a lot of moneyThis CD player met all my needs at a great price."
1,Bad experience,"I ordered this as a gift for a friend of mine for Christmas. Well, when she tried to play it, the CD player would play for a maximum of 1 minute, and then stop. We checked batteries, and made sure we'd totally unpacked it, but nope. It insisted on only playing 1 minute of any song. So then we phoned up memorex, and they said that we have to talk to Amazon. This is in great contrast to Epson(I bought a printer from Amazon a while back) who sent me a brand new printer to replace the old defective one the very NEXT DAY. Sorry, I don't think there was a good deal here."
1,Inferior Variation On A Hackneyed Theme!,"Silly, forgettable non-thriller of the dime-a-dozen potboiler variety, whose only redeeming attraction is the lovely face and give-it-all-ya-got acting of Halle Berry.Robert Downey, Jr.'s one-expression countenance and wooden acting was insufferable. Porcine Charles S. Dutton as Berry's husband should have gotten the casting director fired. The ""surprise"" villain at the end is as predictable as a drought in a parched desert."
2,"Dang, I wanted this to be good","This movie had a few scenes that really made me jump, but then abot 2/3 of the way through, the mood totally changed, and the frightening parts suddenly came to and end. The movie had potential, but was ruined by a weak screenplay."
1,The worst Movie I have seen all year,"This movie sux. It has a very poor plot, it starts out slow, it is predictable, the acting is pure ass, and it definately isn't scary. Halle Berry(2002 Oscar Winner) has just ruined her carrer, and Penelope Cruz can't act at all. This movie is an insult to horror movies, and I know I am 'NOT ALONE' in thinking that. The best part of this movie was the Limp Bizkit song at the end, that is how sad this movie is. Limp Bizkit sux, but Gothika sucks 100 times more."
3,Gothika,"While it's not the most thought out and plausable story, this movie is fairly scary and keeps you guessing about what is going to happen next. Good acting from Halle Berry and Robert Downy Jr. give the rating a boost also. If you want to just watch a fun movie on a friday night, you will enjoy this."
2,"""Gothika"" promises chills, but it's all tame spills!","Halle Berry plays Dr. Miranda Grey, a brilliant doctor in a mental institution who wakes up one morning as a patient in her own hospital and begins to be visited by a female ghost in most ""horrifying,"" as the studio would lead you to believe, ways. I'll ignore the fact that the hospital's lights are always blinking and much of the equipment resembles a 1500s torture machine. But I refuse to ignore the blatant disregard for non-cheap thrills, quality acting, and screenplay (This ""script"" has more plot holes than 200 STAR TREK episodes). At the end of the day, it's somewhat entertaining, but obvious and easy to forget."
2,the acting saves it,"Saturday night, I saw the movie _Gothika_. the acting was excellent, the direction OK, the plot lame....as in: if the plot is too lame to build up viewer suspense naturally, it is not a good idea to insert B-movie creepy horror violins every time a character walks around. or sits down. or opens a door...it's not like the concept is anything anyone hasn't seen on ""In Search Of..."" or ""Unexplained Mysteries"" or a Chris Carter TV series. a decent screenwriter could have done a lot with it, especially with the caliber of acting talent they drew for this film. but no. the resolution was beyond trite, not that one would notice becuase one is too busy trying to resist the tension generated by the bad score.I'll leave it to you, gentle readers, to deduce why on earth they called it Gothika. I certainly couldn't figure it out."
3,DISC PROBLEM,The purchase was smooth. However this is the second HD movie of the same title that has had playback problems. The movie pauses at certain sections of the movie. Amazon sent me a new one to replace the first one and the NEW one did the exact same thing. I even called Toshiba and they said that there is nothing wrong with my player...it has to be a software problem with that particular movie. So if anyone has this movie on HD beware!
4,A nice ride from Miss Gothika herself.,"Halle Barry is at her wits end trying to figure out what's happening to all of these women. They all are being abused somehow and she tries her hardest to put an end to it.She delves deep. And when I say that, I mean D-E-E-P. She starts interviewing a few of the ladies, one by one and then she figures that she will have to investigate further. So she's driving home and this young blond is in the middle of the road. Shocked, Halle goes out and tries to see the problem. Big mistake, Halle.Let's just say that something crazy happens, and you will have to see for yourself. Then her man flips on Her. She deals with SO much s___ in this one. But it gets great. Very interesting, intriguing; the whole nine! And the ending?! W-O-W-Z-E-R-S.It is a thriller of sorts, and I need to own it cause it's creepy-goodness.Cover Art: A-Inside Art: ?Comedic Value: C+Story: ACharacters: B+Length: B+4.25 stars.Overall: B"
3,Gothika Will Keep You Guessing,"I found this movie to be very good in the 'horror dept.' It was full of surprises and many twists and turns. Just when you thought you had it all figured out, surprise!That being said, it was a bit difficult to follow and I found that I actually had to watch it twice to get the full gist of the plot.The movie arrived in very good condition and I was very impressed with how fast it was shipped to me.If you're a Halle Berry fan, and you're into the paranormal, I would definitely recommend this one!"
2,I wanted to hate this film... and have a laugh,"This is not THAT bad a movie. Having seen the previews and having read the panning from critics I was expecting a movie so bad that it's laughable.However this is not as bad as it has been painted. The idea and story is far fetched but it is a ghost story so why should there be rules? There are more holes in this film than on a golf course but the same can be said for many films of this genre.Whilst there would never be any Academy Awards given out for this one the movie is at times very suspenseful and the cinematography is good.At times it feels a bit ""Sixth Sense"" ish - but of course it is in a completely different laegue.Don't write this one off without giving it a go."
1,plagiarism. How do these people sleep at night?,"The basic plot of this movie was almost identical to ""Kiss the Girls."" There are two serial killers working together. One is a doctor and one is a cop. The murders even take place at an abandoned farm. If I was James Patterson I would be suing. Also she discovers that the dead people that are terrorizing her are actually needing her help. Of course everyone knows where they stole that from. The Sixth Sense. I have to admit that it did make me jump a time or two but most of the hospital scences reminded me of Jacob's Ladder. (...)"
2,OK flick - nothing new,"This movie had some real potential, but it was ruined about 2/3 of the way through when the suspense was suddenly turned off. There were some real spooky parts early in the film that had the audience jumping. But once the supernatural parts ended, the movie felt like any other flick. And OOOOOOHHHHHH it was easy to guess whodunit.Another Hollywood disappointment"
1,Failure in 5 weeks,"Out of the box, this unit seemed to work great. It provided a reading within 48 hours and updated properly for a few weeks. However, one week after Amazon's return window ended, the unit gave an error message (ER3). The paperwork states nothing about error messages other than the fact that the machine does regular self checks and displays an error message if it is not working properly. Unplugging the machine cleared the message, but within a few days it was displaying the same error message. I can no longer get it to clear.I am in the process of contacting the company for warrenty repair."
3,basically good fuctionality marginal,The unit gave a reading after 48 hours (as indicated in instructions) which was consistent with a mail-in test kit. The various modes that one is suppose to be able to select don't seem to work correctly on this unit but the basic feature of radon gas reading seems consistent and is very useful.
4,It does the job well. Beats sending 1 time use kits back and forth.,"PRO Series,1986 called, they want they user interface back, the button and the screen.For the price, the user interface could have been implemented a little less archaic. There has got to be a better way to mute and reset things. 1 button does everything is really annoying. The fact that I have to sit there and listen to a bunch of beeping to mute the device is a bit weird. Also it would be nice to have the device remember the mute settings after the power failure (hence the separate reset button).Hey, I am not bitter! Those are the only shortcomings of this unit. It is the best bang for the buck if you want to independently detect Radon levels without calling the 'experts' or buying a bunch of overpriced kits so your house looks like a chemical lab.Buy this thing, it works great. The one time use detector kits were verified precisely."
1,Save your money,"We bought the monitor earlier this year and followed all the instructions. We tested our basement where we usually test with the carbon tests, then we tested on the upper two levels. The results were about the same on all 3 floors which shouldn't be right. Out of curiosity, I opened the window near it for several days and the value never changed. I ended up calling several radon mitigation companies and the state lab. Everyone told me to use a carbon test and not to trust the cheaper continuous monitors. They said that they do not keep their calibration. After running 2 repeat radon carbon tests, I see that the monitor wasn't even close. Save your money and time, and don't buy this monitor."
4,Worthwhile Investment,"We discovered that we had high radon when a friend lent this detector to us. We purchased our own and have been able to monitor the place where we were living and to help others see if they need to purchase one of these.The statement that there are no early symptoms from radon is a lie. We experienced many unexplained issues until we got out of the radon and started to recover. Our bird and rabbit died from the exposure before we knew about the radon. So if you are in a home that has a basement or a slab foundation, it is worth checking into.I have one complaint: The front label sticker is off-center and partly blocks the light. I would think for something in this price range that quality control would be better. While it is a cosmetic issue rather than a functional one, it makes the unit look cheap."
2,Safety Siren Pro Series 3: lengthy equilibration period ...,"We located this detector per instructions in our basement. The inital reading at 48 hours was 9.5 pCi. This increased to 9.9 at 52 hours and thereafter dropped steadily at a rate of 0.1 every 1 hour. At 73 hours the reading is (now) 7.4 pCi/liter. One explanation for this, is the occurence of one or two very large spikes in radon levels which temporarliy increased the running average. Another, I think more likely, explanation is that the device is not working properly, at least during the inital week. As the readings should have been accurate from 48 hours on, I am rather skeptical regarding the reliability of this detector, and may decide to return it. We are doing canister measurements in parallel."
5,Simple to use,"The product looked as expected per description, was basically as easy to use as a smoke detector and very reliable so far (3 weeks). Seems to be accurate as the initial reading matched the numbers from my home inspection. I used mine to confirm Radon levels dropped safe levels after installing a Radon fan. Just plugged it in and waited, seemed like it was about two days before I got a baseline reading, showed two dashes until then. Started at 7.8 and dropped about 1.0 everyday until it leveled off at 2.1 well below the 4.0 maximum safe limit.For the money it's worth it knowing my house is safe for my family."
4,It works!,"It takes two days to get a reading, but it works. We have a radon mitigation system in place, just wanted to monitor it."
1,BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!,it is a good game but not for long.the bears are so easy to find it's ridiculus.1.the grafx stink.2.it takes about15 or 16 bullets to kill it.3.you get 4 weapons.4.the bears run at like 100mph.don't get this game.i wasted 20 bucks on this piece of junk.DON'T BUY IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,Helpful in my work,"I don't know about others, but this book helps me a lot. Good explanations and examples. Interesting, little ""secrets"". But also - it showed me what not to do! I found several mistakes, and weak points on our site, and am fixing it all now. Never tought such little things can make such a big difference..."
2,Win XP--buggy,"Very frustrating experience trying to get this to work--and it should be so simple! I have Win xp home edition and I tried to use the (included) CD ROM's win 2k drivers, which work on a lot of other hardware. However, in this case they did not so I went to the viking support page, which led me straight to the Win XP update. Bad news? The page with the updated drivers cannot be found--it is not available so my pictures remain stuck on my camcorder. Bummer."
3,too tight,"These sunglasses are way too tight! I have a pretty small head, but these glasses are just way too tight that they fall off of my face constantly. I would give them a rating of 2, but they did ship really really fast, so i have to give them credit. i bought them on friday and recieved them on monday. that was awesome. too bad the glasses were too tight."
5,Best Value On Shades You'll Ever Find.....Unless You're A Thief,"When compared to the RayBans, these are a steal. I've wanted Wayfarers for a long time and every RayBan knockoff I would find would either be slightly altered, too flimsy, or overpriced. I finally came across these and read all the great reviews so I gave them a shot. It was the best $13+S&H; I've ever spent. They look identical to the RayBans, just lighter due to cheaper materials. Still though, they are much stronger and better quality than I expected.If you're like me and seem to have a forcefield around you which repels sunglasses causing you to lose every pair you've owned within only months, these are definitely for you. I'm probably gonna buy a couple more as back ups because I just know mine won't be around to see next summer."
3,The Craft- Blackalicious,I oredered this album along with Danger Doom's new release. I had no idea what it was but I'm that kind of guy who always loves to discover new music. What I got was a composition of some very interesting tunes. The Craft by Blackalicious occurs to me to be an experimental rap/hip-hop album. I enjoyed it but it just doesn't have those hooks in any of the songs on the entire album. I couldn't find any song that I could REALLY groove to. You know what I mean. That jam that you could listen to forever and never get sick of because it's just so flow. I couldn't seem to find that in any of these songs. I would say that this is a middle-of-the-road hip-hop album with some very good song writing and a sort-of but maybe not R&B feel to it. Purchase this if you are willing to take the risk of not liking it.
4,"blackalicious- Older, Wiser","Just got the album, bumped it once only so far. 4 Stars. I am a huge-o-mongus 'alicious fan, but I gotta say, this album is lacking something that other Blackalicious albums have, though...I'm...not...sure...what....? It is cool, smooth and the dope sh*t, but I dont know, call me crazy, it is only Par for the Course is what i'll say, and I have come to expect A+ Material, and this album is only an A."

4,Do these guys ever disappoint??,"While I slightly prefer Blazing Arrow over this album (and NIA over both), that's just a matter of preference and not a comment on their quality. Gift of Gab has improved in his flow (he's always been nice but he doesn't ""babble"" that much anymore) and Chief Xcel continues to impress with his beats. The best track isn't really a rap but is sung somewhat: ""Black Diamonds and Pearls""."
1,help,"I'm looking for a karaoke that plays cd's with graphics and also plays cassette tapes WITH GRAPHICS. Does the mks5001 do this or do you have any machine that does.Thanks,Myrna"
2,Pump out another one,Although Klaus uses complex rythm interplay- a far cry from the dreadful early eighties thump thump crap- this whole album just feels like he turned on a machine and out plopped a record. Very little is inspired or griping. I love the guy but this album left me cold.
1,Headset is pure trash,"The headset did not have sound quality, the wires pulled out, and it is a total piece of trash. don't waste a dime..."
2,bulky but fragile,"this is a quite bulky but fragile case. I do not know if there are better options, but this one is not great. First, the lid is already after broken half a day after I bought it, the connecting rod slips out of its socket, so now half of the case is a little unstable. The screen protection is a great idea, separating the console storage space and the game disc storage, but often I find it hard to release the clipped-down plastic piece, and I am in constant fear that the yanking, pressing and pulling will eventually scratch the screen and leave a big mark. May be it is better to buy a softer version. And why should a ""travel"" case be so bulky instead of more portable? It is over priced in store. Buying on Amazon and other discounted sources is recommended!"
3,Not quite surrounded,"This is Beethoven, Of course it's good. The recording and fidelity are fine. The title, however, makes you think you are getting an enveloping multi-channel experience.NO, not even close."
2,they lied.,"okay, i have had this phone for maybe 2 weeks, and i am sending it back tommrow.the keyboard can only be used for the actual text messaging feature. not for the phonebook, or even online.it opens in your pocket and makes an extremly loud and annoying beeping sound.it comes with really random backrounds, like santa putting a star on a tree, and polar bears, and even a farmer with a sheep !i dont get them, but OK.the screen is big, nice i guess, and good ringtones, easy download.its big, and thick, and the keyboard is not worth it. it should be supported all the time. i switch from the nokia with the full keyboard and was extremly dissapointed. the other phone is a much better buy.this phone has no camera, video or any of the more updated features.sorry LG, but this phone is a waste of time, and money.good luck with buying other phones, guys."
4,PJ Kumar is much better.,"same old pattern and lacks indepth knowledge and descriptions.Pj Kumar is easy to read,contains current and up-to-date info and correlates Disease process,diagnoses and management."
3,Mediocre Joker,"Unless you are partial to ""bri-ish"" colloqial terms like foetal and oeosphagus this book is a waste of time. It takes up too much space on my book shelf. Read Big Robbins, it's all in there. I only read this book because I had to for school."
2,creatacard,It was just OK. Not enough choices in each card category. Probably would not buy it again.
4,Excellent basic information and practical applications,"This book gives a very good explanation of trauma and some excellent examples of how to work with it. The information may not be new to those working in the field, but it is the clearest description of brain functioning and trauma that I have read and the treatments she offers are very usable. I highly recommend this book especially for those just learning about trauma or new to working with the clients body."
5,WONDERFUL,"I recieved this book from a very special person in my life(MY SOUL MATE),ever since i have not been able to put this book down.It is written the way books should be written,the right way,ANNA must be a very talented,creative,writter with a great gift that GOD has entrusted her with.I wholeheartably recommend this book to anybody who is looking for a wondreful read.Mark my words,you wont be able to put it down.From begining to end you will find this book,as i said earlier, WONDERFUL.Good luck to you ANNA in this book and all your other works.With love and admiration congradulations on a GREAT GREAT book."
5,RIVETING,"Absolutely riveting!!! I read this book in three days. I could not put it down! As I started reading the first few chapters, I became curious as to the outcome. Once I reached midpoint, I found myself racing through the chapters, hungry for more. Never could I have imagined the twist of events that occurred. So many people were involved in the plot which made it even more intriguing. At the end of the book, I wished there were more. Could there perhaps be a sequel Ms. Mavrikis??? The author certainly has a captivating style. She began with a good foundation and built up to a climatic ending! Looking forward to the next book. I hope we don't have to wait too long. I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book, proven by how quickly I was able to finish. Excellent!! Thank you Ms. Mavrikis."
2,Not terrible but juvenile.,"This cd is like a kid throwing down licks and lyrics in a garage. There are a few appealing songs (maybe 3-4) but overall it was just too adolescentish. Granted I'm over 40, so take my view with a grain of salt. Some of the songs are very caustic and unappealing. If you like garage tunes that are not terribly melodic, with a young mans lyrical whimsy about girls; go for it."
3,Bayou Terror,This is a decent Horror Movie. Lon Chaney plays a pretty good role as a Gator Hater. The setting in the Bayous make it interesting as well. The ending is pretty good and i would recommend it..because of LON CHANEYS apperance in the movie. Overall not a bad movie for late on Saturday night.
2,A typically mediocre-but-fun Fifties horror.,"Recently re-screening this film again, for the first time in about 36 years, I was surprised to find that it is about as good as I remembered it -- that is, not very! But it remains a fairly enjoyable example of grim Fifties B and W horror. A well-meaning scientist has discovered a miraculous method which enables humans to recover from devastating injuries in the same way some reptiles do. Wow! But there is, of course, one little side effect -- it also turns them into semi-alligators. Beverly Garland turns in a good performance as the gutsy heroine, and so does Lon Chaney Jr as a brutish drunk. The atmospheric swamp setting is also a plus. The big payoff scene, in which the unfortunate hero gets an overdose of radiation and becomes an almost total alligator (complete with alligator head) is memorably outrageous."
3,Awesome!,"This movie is good, because it is old, and black and white. Plus it has a cobalt bomb, and an angry cajun! The angry cajun tries to take advantage of the not so hot black and white chick. I give it the ""Most secure radioactive material award""!"
3,A fun 50's sci-fi movie!,"A fun movie to watch. This is a classic sci-fi B-movie from the 50's in black and white with a scientist and his wild experiments between humans and alligators... all the elements of a fun and entertaining movie to watch. That's what these drive-in movies were all about. Too many people look for too much realism, or some deep meaning or fantastic special effects by today's standards. This is pure 50's, drive-in, B-movie, sci-fi fun at its best. Dont expect anything more or less. What they make today just doesn't compare to the look and feel these movies give you when you're watching them. The kids will have fun watching this one too. Enjoy it!"
5,I love the alligator people dvd. LOn Chaney is fabulous,"This is a must DVD. Lon Chaney plays his part like he a one track minded idiot. He plays these roles so well. ""I'll get you alligator man!"" He won't listen to reason, just as in the ""Cyclops"", he is only concerned about himself. Beverly Garland is a fine actress here as well. The whole movie keeps you interested to the very end. The new husband leaves Beverly on the train as he runs off. Later you see why, as someone progresses into a hideous creature. All because of a scientist who is obsessed with some silly scheme, many animals and people have to be guinea pigs for his ego. Great fun and I urge you all to buy it. The film quality is good.Herb Salisbury"
3,Very Interesting,"This gave me information about the town of Forks, Wa. It was very interesting what has happened there since the books and movies were released."
2,Not as interesting as I thought it'd be.,"I guess this documentary was sort of informative, but painfully boring. Being a big Twilight fan that would like to visit Forks sometime in my life, I did get a lot of information about the tourism, which was good. But I fell asleep before the DVD was over. Roy Black's part of the documentary was quite interesting, though."
4,Love it!!!! Bigger than I expected but that even better!!!!!,"I Cant wait to make my favorite homemade spaghetti sauce, item is alot bigger than I expected and that's even better!!!! :D"
1,Saddleman Canvas Seat Covers,"Very poor quality, canvas on seat area, stretch material on the sides, colors do not match. The gromets that hold the bottom cover on were already torn from the foam material. This was a very bad choice."
4,film keep jamming,"I watched many lately on computer, but this one keeped getting stuck it made me very angry. I hope it was my computer."
5,Very Good!,"I wouldn't say I like this show quite as well as sayThe Sopranos: The Complete Series, but at the same time I really do like it! I haven't even finished watching season 1 yet...I've got maybe 2 discs left, but I've watched enough to know I like it and I have been pretty enthralled in it. Good cast and story and everything. If you like good crime drama, then friends...this is a show for you!"
3,Buyer Beware! BD set is defective,The Blu-Ray versions of this set are defective (as verified by numerous reports from others here). Freezing on some discs (beginning of Disc 2 on my set). Some discs don't even have menus from which to select episodes! (Disc 3 on mine. And I haven't even tried Disc 4 to see what problems may lie there.) Those who have been sent replacements report the same problems. It would seem that the entire run of the BD editions are affected. This set needs to be recalled and re-issued with the problems rectified.
2,Disappointed,"Guess you have to be a big Scorsese fan. This did not live up to my expectations- my dad, brother, and husband and I all watched the 1st episode and thought, ""Meh."" Too formulaic."
2,Faulty disc,"My Boardwalk Empire blu ray set looks great, although the new copy that I received from amazon has a slight problem. Disc one does not load and makes a strange noise when rotating in my blu ray player. All the other discs work, but i cant start watching the show without disc one..."
4,ALMOST A 5,not a full 5 star because of the violence- love the choice of Buscemi for the lead as he is not an obvious choice for his character
4,Great start of a series,We're a little behind the curve on this series but haven't heard a whole lot about it. Very interesting role for Buscemi (sp?). He's doing a great job at it and can tell he gets more comfortable with being the lead as the series moves forward.
4,Can not wait to see all of this!! Looks awesome.,I caught a few episodes of this for the short time I had free Hbo and Showtime. I was hooked but lost as far the order of episodes. So I have waited for this to come to the top of the list at my local library for FREE!! yes I waited almost a year to see this. I am locking myself in my house and watching the whole thing.
2,"Okay sound, bad design","These 'phones came with my iRiver IMP SlimX. The sound from these headphones is okay, but nothing spectacular.My main gripe is that they are badly designed. The headphones have the tendency to fall out of your ear when moving around. Very annoying.Consider the Sony MDP-EX70 headphones instead. They'll give you 10x the listening and comfort pleasure than these mediocre headphones."
4,I got mine in 1969...,"...and have been referring to it regularly ever since. (Probably the only refs I use more often are World Almanac, Statistical Abstract of US, and Encyclopedia Americana.) I know of no better first place to go when I have a question about Chicago (which happens often, even tho I've lived here continuously for 33 years.) The illustrations are a little cramped - if you want better, get 'Above Chicago' (but no where near 1,000.) A good mix of pics and intelligent copy. I was surprised to see it still in print, but that just proves many share my opinions."
4,An inspirational look at the life of an Olympic Champion.,"This well-written book is very motivational and contains many helpful tips and facts, as well as some recipes. This diary-style book gives fascinating insight into Shannon's life both inside and outside of gymnastics. It covers her entire career, from how she began, found Steve Nunno, and how she was able to have 2 successful Olympics. She tells what motivated her to keep going back to the gym, how she coped with injuries and got through rough times. This is a great motivational book and is a must for all gymnasts and gymnastics fans."
2,"Weird, but not satisfying.","Wright has some weird Freudian thing going with demon children borne of the earth. This is one of two books that have the same theme. The book has creepy elements, but overall it just doesn't deliver. It has atmosphere but not much else."
1,This is Microsoft's revenge on Mac users.,"This is Microsoft's revenge on Mac users.There are so many things wrong with this keyboard and mouse.1. The quality is bad. Really bad.2. An alert to tell you the keyboard and mouse are out of range pops up, even when the receiver is resting on the keys themselves.3. After 2 days all the extra buttons ceased working.4. After 1 day the mouse stopped working alltogether.5. There is no feedback from the scroll wheel. You can't tell how fast you're moving it.6. The keys come already pre-stuck for you. Hit the side of the space bar and it won't depress.7. The keys are rattly and very noisy. Like an old PC keyboard.8. The enlarge and the eject keys do not work on a MacBook Pro.9. Now after 5 days, the media buttons stopped working. A restart fixes it temporarily.10. The Zoom slider has never done anythingJust rescued the box from the garbage. It's going back!"
1,Does not work with OS X 10.6.2,"Advertised to work with Mac (should have known better) but does not work with 10.6.2, maybe when ms gets around to writing a new driver......"
2,JUNK KEYBOARD,"THERE ARE ONLY A FEW CHOICES FOR WIRELESS KEYBOARDS FOR MAC AND THIS IS NOT A GOOD CHOICE. I AM NOT THE FIRST PERSON TO HAVE PROBLEMS WITH STICKY KEYS. POOR QUALITY, GO FOR THE KENSINGTON FOR MAC INSTEAD."
3,Adequate but not like properly done fresh ground and tamped.,"Nice, convenient, adequate taste and freshness. However, no substitute for real freshly ground, properly tamped and brewed espresso."
3,blind pig,"there is not much wrong with the CD ,but its a little more rock and roll than blues for me."
3,"just don't ""listen"" to it!","First of all, it's not fair to compare this to the Keepers because it's simply a different band; however, it's not quite as melodic and a little more straightforward metal to those who only know the Keepers. The songs are fairly strong but the major drawback here are the lyrics. With lyrics like "" Kneel down, inhale my odor come, kiss my hand angel"" I don't know how they ever plan to be taken seriously. Deris is a good singer, and to me is reminiscent of Klaus Mein in his style. This band is in desperate need of hiring a lyricist similar to what Robert Hunter was to The Grateful Dead, and they could simply concentrate on writing music. You can enjoy this disc alot more if you can ignore what is being said."
1,Just Like Getting Lost At A Bad Rave,Not a single good track on this CD. I'm just sorry that I was dumb enough to buy it.
2,Awful sound,Based on the reviews I bought this as a replacement for my Creative Zen Micro. What awful sound. I guess for $15 I could have done worse.
3,did not get the case,"the product is indeed very good, but i did not get a case nor the soft material surrounding the speakers."
4,Very good inexpensive buds,"I picked up a couple of pairs of these earbuds for use with my Zen mp3 player. After listening for a couple of weeks, I'm quite impressed. They have a much more detailed sound than any of the other earbuds I've tried under $30, and even rival my Etymotics in their midrange clarity. I can understand lyrics that I never understood before on songs that I've literally listened to hundreds of times. They're quite comfortable in my ears as well.Downsides include a short cord (would be perfect if it was about 6 in longer) -- as is, I can't keep the player in my pants' pocket while listening. The foam covers also don't want to stay on very well.Overall, a very nice set of earbuds at an unbelievable price."
3,"Sound Good, Foam Covers Too Loose","These earbuds sound good, much better than the stock earbuds that came with my mp3 player. They are also more compact than the over-the-ear headphones. But the foam covers are just too loose. Within one day I lost the cover for one ear. And the foam cover for the other ear keeps wanting to come off. If I pull these out of my pocket, the foam cover often stays in my pocket. I'm certain I will lose the cover on the other ear pretty soon. Now I need to find replacement foam covers."
2,Tinny,No bass at all. Unless you press both earbuds into your ears with your fingers. You have to crank the volume way up to hear it.
5,Tom Drum,Why not rate this one at a five star ! This good quailty drum is fun for kids of all kinds!It has fun international designs. The drum can be used for practice with out commitment.I would recomend this for any child who would like to give dumming a go.!
2,There is much better that wasn't on this.,"This is from Tex Williams' Shasta Records era. Fine sounding songs, but hardly any are his. Do we really need his version of Giddyup-Go or Little Ole Wine Drinker Me. This is an interesting look into what he sounded like in his later years, but aside from the fine notes and packaging, this is a very cheap set. Sorry"
2,Not worth the money,"I am a first time camcorder owner and decided to get this camcorder based on reviews on another website. Then, right after I ordered the camera, I began reading the reviews on Amazon and got worried--I should have checked here first. After further research, I decided to also order the Panasonic PV-GS80 to compare the devices.What I found is that the Canon is just as loud as everyone has reported. When I played back the tape on my TV, you could hear the humming noise it makes while filming plus a clicking noise each time you zoom in or out. My other complaints are that it doesn't fit in the hand as well as the panasonic, it has a bottom tape loader, and the power adapter is only a couple of feet longIn comparison, the Panasonic was quite as a mouse. Images are also more crisp on the 2.7 inch screen and the power adapter is at least 5 feet long which is very helpful.I am returning the Canon ASAP."
1,Doesn't come with necessary cable to do video transfer,The camera is decent. The fact that it doesn't come with the correct cable nor software to transfer video to a computer is unacceptable. What do they expect 90% of consumers are going to do with it?
3,Overpriced (Not oppinion; fact),"According the Canon, the ZR850 suggested retail price is $299. Amazon is currently selling it for almost $800. I am not sure if Amazon has the solid gold version of this camcorder, but beware to all Amazon customers that you can find this product way cheaper elsewhere."
1,Complete Poop,"You need a ZERO star rating for this heap. It's total TRASH. It's a camcorder homemade piece of stank. I couldn't even watch the entire thing, I had to FF through with my DVD remote. I was so disappointed. Oh, and don't think for a second you're getting T & A or a girl that looks anywhere near the one on the DVD cover, cuz YOU'RE NOT!! I'm glad I picked this up for 3.00 from my local store in the clearance. Even so, I wish I'd spent the 3.00 on some candy. JUNK!"
3,Ten Poems,"This book wasn't exactly what I expected...the poems chosen in this book are good, by poets I enjoy...the commentary, dissection, opinions were not. Interpretation, I believe, should be left to the reader. If more information is wanted, then read a biography on the poet."
5,It's the number 1 source,"Ofcourse this book has some drawbacks, but I don't know a better resource for Italian wines. If you follow the track of wines rated with 3 glasses you won't be disappointed, if you like the type of wine ofcourse. And with some training you will learn to use the index which is to be honest a bit complicated and needs improvement."
4,"Peter Capstick was the ""guru"" on African hunting adventures",An excellent video for both entertainment and educational purposes. A glimpse at an aspect of hunting that most of us only dream of.
3,Pretty predictable!,Ok movie to watch but very predictable. Malik Yoba is a great actor so you'll enjoy him as usual. It comes on TV from time to time so you could wait. It usually airs on BET network I think.
1,my girlfriend's back,This was so stupid!!! I'm so mad and I want my money back!!! The trailer lead me to believe that this was going to be a good movie. I am highly disappointed!!
3,Definitely NOT pink!,"The pink is actually peach; I was disappointed. They are very silky and stretchy, but very lightweight and snag very easily. They will not keep you warm, but do feel good on your skin."
5,Ride with the Wind,"Craig T. Nelson did a great job in this down to earth American, hart warming, full of love to ride movie. This movie is for anybody who has the PRIDE to be AMERICAN attitude or would like to have it. Thank you, Craig."
3,ride the wind,"the movie was great its one of thoses movies you need to watch alone and eat popcorn and watch over and over again, its a must see foe anyone accept kids."
4,My Wife Loves It,"I bought this for my wife for our wedding anniversary, and she loves it! She now uses it everyday, and has finally stopped leaving her jewelry all over the house.It's a jewelry box. It works as advertised and was a great buy on Amazon.Not much else to say except it works, looks good, and was a good price."
4,Excellent product - fair price,"The jewelry box is well made and is quite versatile. It's designed for smaller pieces of jewelries. You will be able to fit many pairs of ear-rings, rings, necklaces and so on. However, it does not have any large compartments to accommodate large or bulky jewelries. For the price, I highly recommend it."
3,Nice color,"I like the jewelry box, however the screws have to be retightened a lot, otherwise good piece to keep jewelry."
3,its ok,"I bought this for the wife. Its looks very hep and expensive. But it has some basic design flaws that make it not that useful.The first flaw is the bottom drawer. It comes out all the way and there is no way to secure it to the box. So if you happen to pick it up and tilt it (like when you try to put away the box on a shelf), the bottom drawer starts to slid out and falls even with the slight tilt.Second - the compartments in the bottom drawer are fixed so my wife can't store all her bangle bracelets.on the plus side - good finish, ring and ear ring and necklace compartments.Overall I wouldn't purchase this item again."
3,Mixed,"Pro's:handles bass well, altho it doesn't have good bass by default. (especially contrasted with the sharp higher ranges.)highs sound very good, vocals great. larger stage, more live than my ipod 3g earbudsvolume slider (limiter) is very convenientCons:smaller earbud than the ipod earbuds, which are a bit larger. (these don't stay in my ear.)weak bass, unless you increase from your output device which it will handle well. (*fit is crucial with earbuds - if you can get a tight fit to your ear canal, which I can't, you will get much better bass)cord is about 4-5"" shorter than ipod'sOverall I would probably love these - setting my ipod to 'bass booster' gives it a very rounded live sound - but they simply are too loose in my ear, which of course is going to vary for everyone. These buds aren't a sennheiser panacia that you may be hoping for with the sennheiser name, but I think they can be much more than worth it for some people, just not me."
3,"Best cheap earbud, but not stereophile","Even the ""you get what you pay for"" posts might admit that the MX-500 may be the best inexpensive earbud product out there. With a full high range, a surprisingly rich middle, and satisfactory lows, the sound actually eclipses the iPod earbuds. (In fact, some feel getting these as a replacement is a ""no-brainer.""At this price, one shouldn't of course expect stereophile quality; I love the trebly sound, but I have to confess that the sound can get a bit fatiguing. Also (as noted elsewhere), the cord is rather short, and the buds tend to get dislodged rather easily.All in all, the MX-500 offers a superior value for a cheapie earbud, but it won't convince you that your earbud upgrade path is done quite yet."
4,Great Item to buy.,This is a great ear head phone to buy it and use it.It makes great sound. But the only thing I have to mention it...The cord could be a little longer than this.But... this is Sennheiser. It means... you can trust it will make great sound.
3,Tinny,"Returned these immediately. They sound tinny - too high on the high frequency. Crisp and clear, but not a balanced sound in my opinion. If you can control your treble on your player these might be fine."
2,no good bass,"I like the inline volume control, but the sound quality is not satisfying. The bass is too shallow, but you got what you paid. I got it for $8, now I think it not worths so much (just $2 in my opinion)."
3,so so,"I had read a lot about these, but when I finally got them I was a little disappointed as they were not that great. Ended up replacing them with a pair of CX300s for airplane trips and PX100s for home use. The latter are way superior to anything I have used with my iPod ever!!!But I do like the case!!!"
4,Pretty good but...,"the fit could be an issue. Mine fit OK...could be better but whatever... For the price I think they are worth a shot. Crisp sound, but not for BASS heavy listeners. Its comes with volume control which is a nice feature."
2,dissapointing,The creative muvo earbuds that came with my mp3 player are much better these sennheiser's. They have no volume and very little bass. The reveiws I read about the muvo stock earbuds were way wrong! jjt.
3,Too much high,"These have fairly good sound, decent bass, and a volume control, that actually boosts volume for the Palm TT. However, I find them too tinny, to much output on the highs. I'm returning them. The headphones that come with the Clie SJ33 sound better, which are MDR 808V which I think are comparible to the MDR E829V - am going to give them a try."
4,"Large capacity good value, no surprises","I have used this daily for several months to carry an iphone and ipod [extra peripheral memory/battery for appointments, lists, and notes] keys, small box cutter, and it has roomy separate pouches for each. If you can get over the geek factor [tall order] this has been just what I wanted. Loose things in my pockets bother me and this keeps things organized and ready quickly. I have run it through the washer twice and the nylon is pilling a little but the zippers are still smooth and there is no raveling of the seams. The belt and latch are light weight but adequate. When I burn through this one I will get another. For the price, this does everything I want and is lighter and has more capacity than comparable leather versions I have tried but doesn't offer as much protection."
3,"Comfy, tight, material gets moist quickly.","These are alright socks. I like the fit well, they're definitely tight on the leg which is great. I'm not in love with the material. It doesn't really wick away moisture in a good way, and they can start feeling a bit swampy and get funky pretty quickly. The material just also doesn't feel particularly nice. Because of this, I can't say that I really love Gold Toe socks, but I do tend to repeat buy them because they are a good value. If nothing else, the otherwise kind of icky material allows them to maintain their shape and elasticity for some time and just generally hold up well."
2,Too Sheer,"For me the socks are too sheer/thin and too stretchy. They said lightweight, but... While not looking for actual support hose, still feel that the socks stretch too easily. Maybe all nylon rather than part nylon is the problem. Also the socks were full suggested retail - no savings over other sources."
3,Interesting approach to an ordinarily stale subject.,"Being a younger programmer (20) and being unfamiliar with the technologies of the past, I thought that Kohanski was able to convey the true meaning of what programmers are, and the mentality that accompanies ingenuity."
5,The Miracle Of christmas Ancient Cultures,I heard this C.D many years ago. I loved it and used many times during the Christmas season to my Spanish class. The music is great. Songs we know played with South American instruments and the Vancouver Chamber Choirs. I had to order a new one because overplaying the old CD almost wore out. I recommend it. Y Young. Anacortes Washington
2,Just So-So!,"I've had several FireLite external drives in the past. I always liked them and, for the most part, was satisfied with them; although, the past two seemed to up and ""die"" on me when I did not expect any problems. Until they failed, I always found the drives to be reliable and durable.This drive is another story. Maybe it's simply because it's a USB drive, rather than a FireWire drive.It cannot be used to backup files to, as it consistently refuses to complete the assigned actions. It also frequently refuses to accept simple copying of files from another drive --- either a main drive or another external.All in all, I'm disappointed, and I'd pass on this product if I knew then what I know now!"
5,Hats off to Dr. Seuss,I showed this video to my 2nd/3rd grade students. They loved seeing the Cat in the Hat with the Grinch.We all thought it was funny and entertaining.The music and songs were great.
4,Like New,A few pages are colored in and a couple pages have anatomy vocabulary writen in. Barely used and little wear on corners. Is very useful for studying. Good for scanning multiple copies for studying.
1,Roll of thunder,I think this movie was horrible. The movie didn't follow the book at all. Nothing in the movie happend in order like the book was. The movie mixed up the Simms and The Wallaces. I will not recomend this movie to anyone. I do recommend the book.
1,"Roll of Thunder, Hear my Cry is not cool","The movie is very bad. I think Roll of thunder, hear my cry was way less informing than the book. The movie had this dumb... time sequence. It would start in the middle of the book end then jump back to the beginning and then back to the middle where it left off. My overall impression of this movie was it was just dumb."
1,The overall dumbness of this movie is showing.,"This movie was so stupid. It didn't make any sense. It would start in the middle of where the book was and skip around. It was all out of order. I'd rather be shot than waste the money buying this idiotic movie. I wouldn't recommend this dumb movie to anyone in their right mind. If you watch the movie before you read the book, you will see the overall stupidity of this movie. It would make more sense to read the book and forget that they ever made a movie."
1,My review,I did not think the movie was very well organised. The events the movie started with happened in the middle of the book. I was not impressed with actors in the movie either. The actors that they had for some of the parts did not fit their discriptions in the book. I was mad that they did not show Cassies fight with Lillian Jean. This is why I do not think any body should watch this movie.
1,Roll of Thunder Review,Our class read the book Roll of Thunder Hear My Cry by Mildred D. Taylor. After that we watched the movie in class. We had to write an Essay about both the movie and the book. We would not recomend this film because the plot is out of order and the characters are not portrayed well. We would reccomend reading the Newberry Award winning book instead.
1,Roll of Thunder movie is bad!!,"The movie roll of thunder is real bad compared to the book. There were way to many differences. It was really bad... The book was really good, but the the movie just brings it all down... bacause it is the worst movie ever."
4,i like it!,It is very hard to find a suit for me. large in the bust area and normal suits do not hold up well during aqua cardio classes. this suit is great and holds everything in well. I am hoping that it will last long with all the chemicals of the pool but would by another for the great fit.
2,Beautiful but has some issues.,We put this in my newly remodeled bathroom. It looks great but there are two problems. The mechanism for the drain is not very well designed (I got the plastic option). Maybe it's the sink I installed it in but there is no good setting so that the drain opens enough to let the water drain quickly. The second and most important issue is that the aerator is not very well designed (it's an insert) - it doesn't soften the flow of the water and from that height the water splashes into the sink and onto the counter. The thread is a non-standard size and you cannot get a replacement at Home Depot - I'm trying to see if there are other options. Hey but it LOOKS GOOD and the mechanism on the faucet handles is very smooth. Bottom line however: I would not buy this again knowing what I know.
3,Several romances in one book?,"Fern Michaels, I love your books but I hate to break this to you... If you try to cram more then one (two maybe) romances in one story, it just spells disaster.Started off with the father being engaged to a gold digging woman but then dumped her. In the meantime, the triplets all find romance, not to mention Granny has been ""keeping company"" with her new neighbor. Then Jonathan meets someone.Come on, five ""happily ever after"" romances in ONE story? My brain couldn't keep up. Not to mention, there was no time to explore the relationships in depth like most romance books do. There was no way we were able to quite get into the thoughts and feelings of all characters because there were too many characters! And the end everyone was paired up and it just seemed so cheesy. I was quite disappointed. It was a great concept for the book and there are some laughs in there, but if you cram so many romances in one story, you had better make the book a LONG book..."
1,VERY POOR WORKMANSHIP,"DON'T BUY!!!! This product has VERY POOR workmanship. The felt cup holders were not installed properly and ""miss positioned"". The felt in the cue stick holders was either missing or not fully glued in place. The felt in the ball channels was not glued properly in place. Bottom line, VERY POOR QUALITY!!! DON'T BUY!!!"
3,an average product,"The felt in one of the holes that the cue is inserted into was peeling when it arrived. Unable to use that hole. There probably is a better rack then this one, but since this is my 1st and only I do not know for sure."
2,Don't expect a quality product,"I had previously purchase a minnesota fats corner cue rack from K-Mart. It was solid wood and very good quality but was flawed. The felt area for the cue balls was too close together and at the most you could only fit 14 or 15 balls on it. Since, the only reason I purchased the product was for storage of the balls and cue sticks this was unacceptable. I returned it and searched amazon where I found the mike massey rack.The Mike Massey rack is made of pressed board and is painted. I put my rack together on a soft surface and the paint chipped off the front edges exposing the black pressed board underneath. This product is flawed in that the paint does not adhere to it. This product is very poor quality. Only buy if you don't mind a little wear leaving it looking like it came from a thrift store or a garage sale."
4,very pleased,item was in good shape and well built. it was worried it would be very low quality.. but was pleased to find it to be easy to assy. and was pretty good in workmanship..great item for the price
5,"Sweet, Euphoric, Uplifting","This CD has some very melodic and uplifting tunes I haven't come across yet until now. This is the sound that got me hooked to Trance. Smooth, ethereal, dreamy, catchy bass lines, female voices and wordless vocals. For me, Trance inspires, moves, stirs emotions and makes me want to dance and sometimes just reflect. There are some very fresh tunes here that do just that. DJ Tiesto's flawless mixing and choice of Trance tracks makes him one of my favorite top ten DJ's."
4,Play with it for a while and you will like it.,"I didnt like it when i heard it first time, but nowi like it.so play with it for a while and you will like it.Tiesto doesnt have to produce same style over and over again,sometimes its good to hear something different."
3,Not Tiesto's Best (more like 3 1/2 stars),"Nyana is certainly not one Tiesto's best compliations, but it still has a lot of good tracks in it.CD 1 starts out slow with some techno, but slowly starts to get going with Planisphere - Totem. It peaks with Tiesto's own Nyana and his remix of Cor Fijneman - Venus. It finishes nicely with GTR - Mistral.CD 2 is filled with good tracks. Andain - Beautiful Things(Gabriel & Dresden remix), James Holden - Nothing(93 returning mix), and Motorcycle - As the rush comes are highlights of the cd. However, it does not flow as well as CD 1.Although this is a good compliation, it is far from Tiesto's best work, such as his Magik(1-6) compilation series."
4,Great Workout CD!,"Whether you're joggging/running, lifting weights, cycling, etc. you need to have this CD with you. I'm a spinning class instructor and use this CD and the Search for Sunrise 3 CD every day or so, and my class just loves it. It pumps up your adrenaline and it makes you wanna sweat and burn fat! Speaking of adrenaline, I don't recommend listening to Tiesto's music while driving - I've been pulled over many times (for speeding up to 80-90mph!!!)It's definitely worth the money!"
1,"Cute, but protagonist makes it hard to swallow","The book does have its funny parts, with a few clever twists and some witty dialogues, but I just could not bring myself to like the book because the main character - our heroine litigator - is so flawlessly fake and one-dimensional (even in the outrageous, humorous context of the plot). Because of this the book read like a self-indulgent fantasy, oftentimes annoying, which was a shame because some of the minor characters were really quirky and likeable."
4,Quirky comedy about aspiring magicians,"Max (Til Schweiger) dreams of becoming a great Magician in Vegas. So he blackmails Hugo (Fabrizio Bentivoglio) a gifted pick pocket to become his partner. They enlist the help of a professional(Alan Arkin) to help them get their act together and recruit a waitress (Claire Forlani) to be their assistant.What ensues is a trip to vegas. But on the way they must practice and hone their act in the most unlikely of venues. Misshaps and laughs abound as they draw closer to the ""Holy Grail""....VEGAS!4 Stars. If it wasnt for a somewhat slow drawn out begining I would have given it a 5.This movie is unrated apparently. I would rate it at R for language."
5,It works,Experienced blood pressure drop from 150/100 to 140/90 about an hour after drinking the tea. It definitely has mild diuretic effect on the body. Will continue using it.
1,Junk!,"The engine and the remote did not work. Fisher Price customer service told me I had to use Alkaline batteries instead of rechargeables so I tried them and still nothing.I could hear a broken piece falling around inside the remote.In the meantime I bought another engine and remote at Toysrusso my 2 1/2 year old could play with his new train set and it also did not work. The engine light would come on but as you screwed the door in it would go out and the button didn't work. Fisher-price is replacing the original engine and remote. They didn't have the other engine I bought in stock so they gave me a voucher but it wasn't equal to what I paid. This was one of my son's ""special"" presents for Christmas. What a let down and what junk they are selling!"
4,Best time spent and well worth the money!!,"We purchased this product for our granddaughter (2 years old). She sat down with the set the first day and spent well over an hour playing with it. It is now the first thing she goes for each time she comes over. Well worth the time and money.Battery life is good, the set is easy to operate, and is sturdy enough for a little one to stand on (as they will) without breaking."
4,This is a great reminder for meds,"I gave this only 4 stars because it is a pain to re-set since it isn't a clock. You have to wait until the right time to make a setting, but if your meds are stable you only have to re-set twice a year when the clocks change. The beep is loud enough to hear a couple rooms away without being too loud while in the same room. It has six available settings which is more than most ""reminders"" have. It is also small enough to carry around and the price was very good."
1,not so universal stopper,"the picture does not show the underside of the stopper which has a protrusion, and consequently do not fit all bath tub drain."
1,Don't bother,"Unless you are buying these for a child or you have a small head, don't buy them. I could barely get them around my head. I have given them to my five year old daughter and they fit her perfectly. The headphones also light up with the music, again appealing to my year old but not me."
1,BAD PRODUCT!,"Don't waste your money, not only do these headphones look bad when you put them on, they are not made to fit and adult head. The flashing lights are annoying and they keep turning on by accident. Worst of all is the quality, I did not have mine for more that a month after they were already starting to sound bad. After 9 weeks I finally put them in the garbage where they belong because the sound quality had deteriorated too much and sound was only coming out of the right side."
4,Solid Reggae,"Slip into some solid roots reggae, a trip to the roots. Can't miss with this album. Much love."
1,Not a credible story,"She gets gang raped when young, and as an adult, goes back to get revenge. She exposes her beloved rape son to the poisonous tongues of a small town. Hard to swallow. She is terrified by well meaning men, but not by her rapist when she stops her on a lonely road close to the place where the dirty deed occured. The book has a lot of nice moments but the inconsistencies are overwhelming. I gave up on page 337 so I do not know if it gets any better or even worse at the end."
2,"Cliches abound about the South, very outdated descriptions","This book is so cliche-ridden that it takes away from the writing. It has a poor girl from a small southern town, a rape by good ol' boys, a rescuer in the form of a poor black man in overalls, poor girls with stringy hair, poor men with greasy hair, etc., etc., etc. I did eventually get interested in the story, but had to suffer through an outdated view of people in the South. Not one of Ms. Brown's better works."
3,Did not work for mp3 player,"Works in cd player, but not condensed enough to get it on the mp3 players easily."
2,flushing sound!!.....,"didn't really enjoy the storyunhelpfulthe flushing button is no big dealdidn't interest my granddaughter at all, and she loves Dora"
2,Not a great potty book. Not a great book. Lousy flusher.,"My daughter is a Dora junkie. I've bought just about all of the Dora story books. My daughter loves the Dora story books. This book, by contrast, is nothing special. Okay, it is about Dora and my daughter loves Dora, but it is not the caliber of the other books. It is not even as good as other potty books. It has a built in flusher, which is not very loud and does not add much to the experience."
2,not impressed,Was NOT impressed with the book. My daughter is now potty trained but she learned with a sticker chart that I printed out for free
2,cute book but....,...it certainly has not encouraged my daughter to venture any further into potty training. She likes to read the book but as far as getting her excited to use the potty... not so much. I really wish Dora would come out with a Dora Potty Training Adventure video in addition to the book!
2,"Yet another useless item to throw in the ""Dora"" pile...","I, along with many other parents of Dora lovers feel almost obligated to buy anything and everything Dora. It's what drove me to buy this book, and since my daughter is semi-interested in the potty, I thought, ""why not?"". Yes, the book is cute, it makes sounds (oooh!) and of course my daughter loves it. Please note that there isn't actually a picture of Dora on the potty, just a ""before"" and ""after"", which is not very educational. Just don't be fooled into thinking that this book is actually going to aide you in the draining process of potty training. When your child is ready, they're ready, and when they're not, well... they're not, and no book is going to make them ready. Not worth it, in my opinion."
4,"A new ""favorite"" movie","Having grown up in Brooklyn in the '70's in an Irish-American household, I found so much to appreciate in this movie; the sights and scenery, the music, the clothes, the relationships, but it also had a timeless quality to it in both the story and the characters. Brian's story of wanting to escape from cycle of working hard for little reward is always appealing, but the richness of the supporting players really made this movie one of my new ""favorites"". It was quite poignant, but with some good laughs thrown in.Of special note, Karen Allen, as Brian's mother, was hauntingly beautiful. At times you pity her, at times you question her, and at times you applaud her strength. She delivered an amazing performance."
3,Gets the job done,"I purchased these billiard balls for a backyard 'carpet ball' table.The numbers are not black, but are the color of the ball.They work well for this purpose."
1,Cheap Balls,"Inexpensive doesn't have to mean ""cheap,"" but in this case it does. First off, the balls delivered do not match the balls pictured in the advertisement. Traditionally each ball's number would be printed in black -- as in the product pictured. But with the product received, in order to (presumably) pinch pennies on dye, the manufacturer printed each ball's number in the same color as the ball. This means each ball only needs to be printed with one color instead of two, but it also makes it hard to read the numbers on the lighter colored balls, and it makes them all look really cheap. What you see is not what you get. Recommend you try another manufacturer."
2,Cheap - Chipped Quickly,"Pretty cheap built set. Even excluding the fact that the colors are different than in the photo (numbers have same color as ball), these balls chipped pretty quick. After I got them I used them for an hour or two daily for maybe a week or two and the outer paint started chipping off the ball, which wouldn't be a big problem (I really don't care how they look) except that it causes them to not be perfectly round and every now and then it affects game play. I don't recommend this set."
5,These balls are great to play with!,"Coming from a novice, these balls seemed constructed well enough and the value is really great. Came just as they look in the picture."
2,"She marched, she slept, she ate, she fought...","Then she marched, she slept, she ate, she fought, she marched, she slept, she ate, she fought, she zzzzzzzzzzzzz."
2,Not What It's Hyped Up To Be,"I thought, from looking at the material presented on it, that it would be useful. It has lovely multimedia but it has very fuzzy images. For the paintings that aren't considered ""masterworks"" the images or even fuzzier. Its a lovely overview but I don't reccomend it for reference or educational use. It takes about an hour to see all that it has to offer."
2,Just Showboatin',"Who the heck does this guy think he is? I'd like to give him a country butt whoopin' for making me waste my money on this claptrap. Ok, I laughed once. Maybe twice. Not real laughs, just snickers. And not loudly."
5,"Many cute, fresh ideas","Wow! what a fun book! I will never make boring labels again. I love the little three dimensional animals for children's quilts. The section on making labels for old quilts was wonderful, especially with the photos of the quiltmakers and the people who got the quilts. A large number of the labels in the book were printed on the computer. I will try that and I want to try the crayon labels also. Might even try the cross stitch one...."
2,Boring,"Sorry. I would love to write a more favorable review but for the most part the music is lackluster providing little to no musical tension.Yes,there are some palatable cuts but all in all..blah."
5,Forbidden Hollywood,"Love this series of films! This series shows how films were really supposed to be made before the ""Hayes Code"" crew took over and tried to clean things up and make Hollywood films more of a ""moral lesson"". ""Night Nurse"" is not to be missed! After all, who doesn't love Joan Blondell and Barbara Stanwyck!"
4,It's about the Men,"The Frogmen maintained its focus on the men. It capture the attitude and the temper of the times. The action scenes tho dated by the movie technology of the times, still showed a peek into the real life dangers of the job of the UDT. The real UDT 4 did experience several of the missions incidents as portrayed by the movie. The real gem of this movie is a peek into the socialization of the ship's company interacting with dare devil, ""he-men"" of the UDT. The movie showed the importance of team as well as the respect the UDT had for each other, if you proved yourself. I'll watch again and again."
5,mind body connection,Excellent book helping us to see how stress affects us physically. Look up any physical ailment bothering you and you will discover the possible mental and emotional reasons behind it. This book is even better than You can Heal Your Life by Louise Hay. Highly recommended.
1,Leaks...,"This is the second identical arm with the same problem. I can not get it to stop dripping from both ends of the pipe. I have even had a professional plumber look at it, and he determined that it has to be the arm. We have tried 3 different brand new shower heads and an assortment of teflon tape, teflon paste, etc..."
1,"Good chips, crappy customer service.","I've ordered this item three times. Lightly salted, right? Three times I've gotten my order, and three times it's been wrong. Very disappointing.The chips themselves are very tasty, though...just WAY too salty for me."
5,Cedrick steals the show!!!!!!!,"This movie was so much worse than Uncle Sam, so if you rent the two make sure you save Sam for last. I saw Basketcase when I was little, and it was cool, but 3 wasn't. My suggestion: watch this movie when you're a little kid. The best line: Oh, I see you brought your lettuce Cedrick."
3,SHORT SLEEVE SHIRT A LITTLE SHORT IN QUALITY,THIS SHIRT IS OKAY - THE SCREEN PRINT DESIGN IS AWESOME BUT THE SHIRT MATERIAL SEEMS THIN AND CHEAP AND IT RUNS QUITE LARGE. I BOUGHT THIS DESIGN IN LONG SLEEVE ALSO - SAME SIZE AND THE FIT IS GREAT AND THE MATERIAL OF THE LONG SLEEVE IS MUCH HEAVIER AND GREAT QUALITY.
5,World History,"I actually get into this textbook. I have never had a great interest in history in general, but this has woke up the latent historian in me. Even as a text, I find it easy to read and interesting."
5,more wonderful accounts,"....of Rumpole by John Mortimor. Unfortunately, John and Rumpole's embodiment, Leo Kern, for whom Mortimer created Rumpole, are now gone. Enjoy it anyway. The 42 or 43 episodes created With Leo Kern for the BBC are priceless."
2,toned way down,"and for a shock comic like her, that's career death, she's married and happy so what does she have to complain about? Even the racial epithets seem so toned down, it's like she's Star Jones whispering to Marlee Matlin. I don't think anyone was offended, not even those who should have been. Her husband seems to have a lot more crowd appeal than she does but the same could be said of her dog, Mr Parker. I'm not sure a lot was gained by repeating lines which were in the act in the bonus features or by faking a roast for those who should be roasted but aren't. Her video is aptly named though, tough love is tough to love, even for LL fans but she has learned one thing that should help her, insert ""Palin"" in any joke and it gets laughs."
5,révolutionnaire,"""Freedom sounds in dub"" est peut-tre le meilleur cd de roots dub qui soit. Le grand King Tubby est à son apogée, mixant au mieux les mélodies incroyables de Soul Syndicate. Cet album montre toute l'étendue du potentiel du dub; aucun groupe n'est parvenu à atteindre une telle perfection dans le son. Rythmes jouissifs et mélodies apocalyptiques se marient à merveille pour donner un des meilleurs albums de tout les temps. Les 5 premières chansons vous montrent le talent incroyable de ""matre"" King Tubby. On se prend alors à rver d'un King Tubby encore vivant et donnant des concerts à travers le monde. Pour compléter cet album, je conseille ""termination dub"" de King Tubby et Glen Brown, ainsi que tous les albums d'Augustus Pablo"
3,Sized incorrectly,"These were nicely made, handsome shoes but too short for my feet. Order up a size."
1,Engineering disaster,"The gate has the rounded corner at the bottom towards the floor and the flat edge at the top...this results in four exposed ends with plastic caps which may result in water eventually entering. The latch assembly is horrible and anyone not familiar with it won't know how to enter...maybe good for burglars! The stainless steel parts didn't arrive with the gate so I will have to disassemble it later. My solution was to turn the gate upside down and have the rounded end on top, which I think looks much better anyway. The materials are good, but with the expandability feature of the gate there is a lot of potential standing water on the gate and a weakening of the structure. All in all I would rather have a single size gate with a latch that is well designed. I would not suggest purchasing this gate for any medium or large dog that wants to jump on the gate."
3,Stairway special foils parents as well as children,I was initially impressed with the all steel construction of this baby gate. The installation was pretty straight forward until you have to align everything. This is were it all fell apart. I took me an hour adjusting the mounts and eye screws that help you level the gate. My wife had to remind me that this was a 77 dollar gate and I shouldn't destroy it in a fit of anger. I finally got the gate to easily rest in the mount. There are two latching mechanisms. The first requires the user too lift the gate out of its dock position. This was easily accomplished. The second lock clamps around the top hitch. I realized the tolerances on this lock were so tight that any hope of one handed unlocking would be impossible. It took my wife 5 minutes before she could unlock it. The mechanism is simple. It's just so difficult to get the thing to unlock. May in version 2 they will fix this.Chris
5,Best gate out there.,"I was very picky about the gate at the top of my stairs. I looked closely at the gates my friends had installed and purchased three others before this one. Finally I am thrilled with this gate!! I know it's a little more expensive than the others but it is totally worth it! It was easy to install. It's easy it open and lock (I taught my five year old to do it, however if you don't want older children to be able to open it they won't be able to figure it out on their own). It can stay open at night and doesn't slam shut unless I pull it shut. Secure for top of stairs. We've been using ours for over a year and I'm still thrilled with the quality. It's still just as sturdy as day one! Love it!!"
3,Disappointed,"I thought this gate rather delicate. The first one I ordered (not through Amazon.com) arrived in a box so damaged I wondered why they would ship something like that. The gate itself was broken with half a bar sticking outside the box. I returned it and then ordered through Amazon.com. Again the box was a bit damaged but the gate was intact. The paint, however, is very thin and several people mentioned that it rusted even though it was supposed to be rustproof. I contacted Cardinal 3 times which they never answered. I got tired of waiting and purchased another gate locally. I returned this gate. It had such a high rating and I really thought it would be strong and would be satisfactory for my outside porch, but was disappointed. The gate I finally installed is much stronger for my very active dog."
5,nice baby gate,My husband installed this gate and didn't have any problems. Its a very sturdy gate and it seems like it will last a long time! Its very easy to operate one handed.
2,Not for those new to poetry,"As one who is trying to learn about poetry, I found this book way beyond me. For those who are well-versed, looking at the sound of poetry may be a wonderful new way to approach the matter. The book begins, for example, with a long discussion on how words are accented. The word accented has a stressed first syllable, while example has a stressed second syllable. While I'm sure this has a profound effect at some deep lever, for those who simply want to know how to understand poetry at the most basic level, this doesn't help."
5,Beginning metaphor mentality,"Now I read some of it. Rabbit or perhaps Jack rabbit would add stress for Pat. My Grandfather was an English Professor at ASU for 15 or more years teaching English. He wrote or Co-wrote a series of English grammar books from grades 1 through 8. I failed English as a freshman in Highschool. I believe Poetry has helped me to awaken the writer inside me. I could go on and on about me and more me!!!!!! I'm considering College seriously. Art/Humanities. If monet was alive, we would have much to talk about... God bless, CA Conlin"
3,Sony CDX-GT705DX,Sounds OK but it's impossible to read the display from behind the wheel.The controls are not well designed and are not logically placed on the panel. I would not buy this model again.
3,Shoe Stand,"Initial when i order this i got only one stand I was really frustrated and shouted at the customer care, then they send me the other stand which is now good also looks better. But at the first time i really upset."
1,THE PHOTO IS A LIE!!!!,There are two shelves stacked together. But what you are buying is only one! Screw it! It costs no more than $10.
2,Grand Teton/Yellowstone,"Pictures on the cover is better than the video. Does an OK job at showing the major geological features of the park, but most of the video is animals. Not balanced if you like to see other topics. Finley-Holiday makes a MUCH better video covering both parks."
1,These NEVER stay Sealed,"I have not had ANY luck with these things staying sealed. I have about 10 of them. They work for about 3 days, then give up. I have even gone so far as to seal the zipper closng with packaging tape. No luck. Now I have all these bags I have to periodically re-vacuum every couple of months. I don't overfill them, I underfill. Great Idea if they really worked. I'd be happy if it stayed sealed for 6-months."
1,Its cool for about an hour,It just doesn't work.You can suck the air out - great.And then the air goes all back in in a very short period of time.Waste of money.
5,Don't miss it!,"When was the last time you were really glad to have bought a CD? I ended my dry spell when I went out and snagged a copy of The Bird & The Bee's self titled album. Really, I had no choice: the hook from ""Again & Again"" was stuck in my head for THREE DAYS, likely a record.Just when I was done marveling at the melody in that signature track, I was amazed again (& again) by Inara's vocal harmonies in the chorus of ""My Fair Lady."" It made me think of some kind of twinkling singing fairies in a 70's Disney picture, without the annoying smarmy aftertaste.It's like Freezepop, only more mature.It's like Stereolab, only more personal.It's like Dot Allison, only more substantial.It's like a breath of fresh air that someone is finally producing really good music so I can start buying CDs again. Bravo The Bird & The Bee!"
4,Make sure you can play Region 2 DVD's before buying it,"My DVD Player can't play European ""Region 2"" DVD's so I had to watch this on my MacBook, which only allows you to change regions 3 times. Other than that it's a great movie and I would rate it 5 stars if the listing explained the region problem better. I understand that Region 1 (American) DVD's of this movie go for $100 because it shows a young topless Claire Forlani in her starring role as a Gypsy, one of her first movies. So thank you for selling these. Forlani does a great job playing a Gypsy and it's a great movie. Find out whether your computer can play Region 2 before buying it, because American DVD players don't."
3,Hot Move Style,Style of music you do not only listen but let your body move to the rythm and feel it !
2,software crashes during printing,"Adobe's Business edition crashes easily when trying to print to my 24"" wide HP designjet plotter. It could be file size or something else, but I'm no teckkie, so I don't really know. Adobe offers no help.Other than that, HP's bundled software (PhotoPrinting) is much easier to use but it doesn't support the large format."
5,dynatron remote,"Nothing we bought locally worked with our television but, this one is wonderful. No troubles with it at all. It is a good product and the price was right."
1,Disappointment in this book,"This would have been a good book if not for the language used. I cannot enjoy a book whith such terrible misuse of language. If she really experienced a conversion and change of life by Jesus she could not even use such language in the telling of her story. I threw the book in the trash, where I felt the book belonged."
5,Two - Two - Two Traditions In One,"Definitely an oldie but a goodie. I read the 'The Western Way Omnibus' some twenty or so years ago when it was originally released as two separate books, 'The Western Way: Native Tradition' and 'The Western Way: Hermetic Tradition.' These two volumes served as my initial introduction to Caitlin and John Matthews' work and I found them both to be highy informative, easy to understand and incredibly rich in the understanding of sign and symbol.However what I found the most helpful is the Matthew's wonderful storehouse of imaginative and potent journeying narratives. I have personally used a number provided within and have found them to be amazingingly successful.A wonderful read of both traditions, specially if you're into pathworking. I was particularily impressed by the native material in volume 1, but that opinion is based more on personal perference than anything else."
1,Kept the kitty out.,"Kitty drove me crazy trying to get to the cat nip inside the container, but once I put some out for her, she seemed to have no interest in it. Even the other four cats just took a simple sniff and left it."
1,Poor sound quality,"The ""noise"" that goes through the extension crackles and no bass gets through. I have not tried the splitters, or adapters."
5,Great Adapters,"This is a great product, good adapters, works very well. The extension cord is great......works perfect for me."
5,I love it,it one of best products that i have bought so far and i also like it because it long.cdascoakvpaldVB vn MzfvlJOFGJQOJTGOQEJAVGAENBG;HBJQP
5,Maxell,"Good product, as described. Not very useful past the range as the tension pulls on the headphones. Pretty cool, nevertheless."
2,false advertising,"This chord is really about half the length they claim. The coiled part is impossible to fully extend, but the only way this chord would be the length they claimed would be if you could uncoil this. Also because it has a huge coiled up part in the middle the chord is very heavy. If you do not place something on top of it to secure it you may find the chord's weight pulling your ear plugs from your ears.It does work fine however, just be aware the length is much shorter then they claim, and the chord is heavy."
4,Love the Adapters,"The sound quality with this cord was just as good as without, and I love the multiple adapters, but I wish it was a little shorter."
5,Good experience.,This product arrived quickly and I have not had any problems with it. I'm very satisfied with my purchasing experience.
5,With this extension who needs wireless ear phones ?,"As part of my upgrade to my Sony TV, I purchased this extension cord and it works like a charm. I can sit in my bed across the room and plug this between my ear phone set and TV and listen to quality sound. Who says you need to pay high expense for wireless ear phones?"
5,it is very long,"the extention is as long as 20 feet just like they say , i thought its a little short but when u stretch it is like 25 feet , even better .non of the adapters offer any kind of distortion that i could notice probably the extention that makes the sound a little bit lower but thats nothinggood quality , its worht it"
3,Capable but heavy.,"Does the job very nicely, but is heavy and tends to pull your 'phones out of position."
5,Worked as expected,This extension cord did what it was supposed to do and did it just fine. No problems whatsoever.
2,"Nice Concept, Disgusting Coffee","I bought this coffee maker because I really liked the press-to-pour concept. I must say, however, it makes the most disgusting cup of coffee I have ever had. It started out ok but over time and even after filtration cleanings, the coffee came out rank.I have a hard time throwing things that still work away so I asked my husband to give it to one of his workers and he wouldn't do it so I guess it goes to Good Will. I pity the fool who buys it.My suggestion: Don't do it no matter how tempted you are. Keep looking."
4,Great idea,"I purchased this as a Christmas gift several years ago. Had done some research on coffee makes and this seemed to be rated very well overall. No one has ever complained to me, so I'm assuming it worked well."
2,Coffee Failure,"This coffee maker quit working after 14 months of service. Coffee was ok, but I have tasted better."
2,Buyers Remorse,"For a high end coffee maker, I am underwhelmed by this product. The dispensing spout on the coffee reservoir has a slight drip ... about five drops in a two hour period. I use a small plastic dixie cup to catch the drip. A significant amount of condensation accumulates on the lid of the unit. When you open the lid, some of that condensation runs down the back of the unit on to the counter top. Have a towel ready. The clock has an LCD display with black numerals that are difficult to read in anything other than direct light. Back lighting the display would have eliminated this nuisance. None of the foregoing are show stoppers, but if I had a do-over, I would not have purchased this unit."
1,D.O.A.,"I got this thing home, set it up per the instructions, switched it on and I started smelling a hot odor. That was the extent of it's capability: it never would begin brewing. Took it back and got a Senseo, which so far, I'm really enjoying."
2,don't really like this one.,I've had this coffee maker for 18 month now. I don't like it. Its too big. The handle broke after 3 weeks. I don't like cleaning it. Plus it leaks everytime you get coffee. Don't buy not worth it.
2,Do not waste time and money,"Do not even think of buying this movie or any other from ""the Asylum"".If you have nothing better to do with your money at least rent it or buy it used (if it costs less than $5)."
1,horrible,"Gawd it's bad, The acting is bad The whale is made to look like a shark/sperm whale hybrid which , is very unrealistic. Add the bad angles and a script that has so much useless crap they could just have left out this movie is crap."
2,"just okay, not great","I typically love Christina Dodd's books. I have many of them and am constantly re-reading. However, the last few I've read have been a disappointment. This one is no exception. I'm not sure what is happening, but I'm not feeling any connection with the characters. Perhaps because the characters don't have a connection themselves? Without giving you a synopsis (which is not a review), the story lacked development, attraction and likeable characters. I'm sorry if this is harsh, but I wanted my money back."
1,Lacking and NOT user friendly,"So someone gave me a garmin 60csx with the United States Topo 3 cd set. I was excited and was hoping I could use this gps for navigation on road and in the boat. Apparently not, first off it takes hours and hours to figure out the Mapsource software, that is once you finally download the right version. Then it is not clear ANYWHERE that addresses are not included. So after wasting hours I finally do some google searching to find out these maps cover nothing at all really. And trails or whatever else you might want, good luck, I simply wish the names of rivers were on the darn thing. I live in Florida, we do not have mountains so I am scratching my head wondering what good this thing is. I guess since I am a boater I could spend $300 to get the bluechart but after seeing the value of the topo maps I am concerned about throwing good money away for a lackluster product. Oh well it was free so who really cares, I can always use it on the boat as a backup unit."
5,"A great help for our trip, I recommend it highly",This mapping software for my GPS Garmin 76csx was a great help in finding trails and roads. It was close for elevation in the area. Thanks!!
1,Don't Waste Your Money!,"To bad there wasn't a choice to give this 0 stars. Mapsource maps aren't good enough to deserve 1 star. I spent over a thousand bucks on a Garmin StreetPilot and the Mapsource unlock keys. The StreetPilot would be a great investment if it used maps other than those ones produced by Mapsource. If I use my StreetPilot as the gps receiver and hook it up to my laptop and run Microsoft's MapPoint, I get much more detailed maps and better accuracy. If Garmin wanted to improve their product, they'd leave the hardware alone and ditch Mapsource."
1,This is a complete Rob,"I paid a lot of money for this CD upgrade for my Garmin, and I still haven't downloaded it after a year. I took it to two expert computer shops, and they can't do it. I went to website, downloaded countless updates and drivers, and it still won't work. I will never buy a Garmin product again."
2,Mapsource US TOPO,"I found out today(06/28/06 From Garmin, after I contacted them about a transter problim with the CD software that the last update to the soft was in 1999.I was superised That the program is this old.Frankly thats not addiquit. But there is nothing I can do with that."
1,"Didn't work, messed up other software and computer","I installed this software package on my year-old computer, but when I tried to start it I just got an error log file to be emailed to Garmin. Their tech support department was closed. Worse, another Garmin software package (MetroGuide) had now stopped working, and the Windows Uninstaller kept crashing when I tried to remove them. A good hour and a half later I have finally reinstalled MetroGuide and made it run, but USA TOPO is going back to the store. I already have enough things that don't work!"
4,Great for my GPS,"I bought this software mainly for use onscreen on my new 60CSX GPS, and so far it's been great for that. I've also sampled some of the trip planning features on my laptop, and that's worked out well, too. My only compliant is that the back roads aren't labeled on my GPS screen, so it makes it hard when I'm driving and want to know quickly what road I'm looking at, but the routes are pretty accurate, so I can usually identify by that. Also, some of the data is out of date for those remote roads. I've found a couple so far that are listed as roads, but have been converted to hiking trails, or reverted to elk trails, many years ago. Coupled with a more detailed (and sometimes more recent, though not always) Forest Service map, it's just fine. Well worth it for adding detail to your onscreen GPS maps."
4,Lots of interesting data - perhaps not detailed enough sometimes,"Lots of interesting data such as peaks and other landmarks. The data is not very detailed sometimes, however. I'm guessing that the data came from the 15' topo maps. On a trip I made to Yosemite, the data had the same error contained on the 15' topo maps and the Yosemite park maps itself (apparently, the 7.5' map has the right data). (The data had to do with the layout of some drainages.)"
3,"Its not the greatest software, but it is a great value","I recently bought the eTrex Legend for its ""bread crumb"" trail capability in the mountains. I also bought the Mapsource USA Topo package even after reading the lukewarm reviews. I see the drawbacks that have been elucidated in the online reviews--today I was driving on Interstate 795 in Maryland, but the Legend screen showed no road and gave the impression that I was traversing some open terrain! Even so, I have been impressed with the level of detail in other circumstances--showing small streams, listing major street names, showing basic contour lines, etc. Today, I became disoriented after temporarily exiting a major highway and could not easily find the highway again--the Mapsource maps were more than sufficient to help me quickly and efficiently navigate 5-6 miles and get back on track. My conclusion--I would buy this again anytime...."
2,Poor Detail,The detail is pretty poor. I was expecting better since the Bluecharts and citi select is outstanding.
5,Commentary of Matthew.,An excellent commentary written by an outstanding biblical author. Book was in pristine condition and delivery was very fast. I buy from this dealer whenever they have an item I want.
3,Blinking Lights Don't Stay On,"Maybe mine have a problem but I usually don't listen to my headphones real loud. You get accustomed to whatever volume you train your ears at so, to not go deaf, I listen at about half volume. The blinking lights on these headphones come on right above that. Why would they do that? Why have a sensitivity that'sA) Non-adjustable, andB) Why have any sensitivity at all if the lights don't go to the beat of the music?I mean there's an on-off button on the cord. I don't get it. Other than that, the sound is great for the price.Did anyone else have this problem with theirs?"
3,Not recommended for hockey.,"I had a really frustrating time trying to use this as a hockey radar. It would only register 1 out of 7 or 8 shots directed at it. I tried everything to get it to work - including mounting it on a tripod, raising it higher, lowering it, adjusting the angle up/down, moving closer/further out when shooting, etc. before exchanging it. I had the same problems with the new one. I think a hockey puck is just too small for it to reliably register. I bought the bushnell speedscreen sports kit and am very happy with that. It picks every shot up, no problem."
4,Radar for ice hockey & ringette; works fine!!,"I've used this radar for my children ice hockey & ringette training. it is accurate enough and gives immediate feedback how fast they really hits the puck or ring (in ringette. Easy to use, they can do it by themselves, just have to look the distance so that radar does not take the speed of the stick."
1,This fool has gotta give it up,"This fool has about as much rap skill as Deion Sanders had when he tried to have a rap career. He needs to give it up he had his success in 90 when he dropped ""To the Extreme"" which used more samples than a P. Diddy and Will Smith album combined. Thank goodness for Eminem to give some credibility to white rappers cause Ice definitely did not he was the dookie stain of the rap game. With this album he's just full of angry with all these heavy head bangin songs. I guess I would be angry to if I was hated by everyone in the world."
3,I THINK YOU NEED A TEACHER,"For those using this book I will say to you... well, va bene. It is a very good book and is full of information. Like so many people above have said, it is only in Italia, so you will need a dictionary for it. I think if you really want to learn Italian and SERIOUSLY AND I MEAN SERIOUSLY devote your time to learning it, then this is the book for you.However, I believe that you do need a teacher for most things. This book will help you to read and write Italian very well.... but you need a teacher or someone who knows Italian to speak with. You will need a dictionary, so I hope looking up a lot of words does'nt bother you. I will say though, if you know Latin, then Italian, you will find, will be very easy for you to read. I am living in Italy for one year and using this book with a teacher, it works great... however, if I was alone or about to come to Italy, I'd say try something else. Spero questo era buono!"
4,"Super light, Well Balanced, Cheap","For a light outfit, the Berkley Cherrywood 2 pc 5'6"" is a great little rod. Do not expect heavy duty use out of the rod, as the price you pay is comparable w/ the durability of this rod. I snapped mine after getting snagged in a tree branch. For an inexpensive light spinning rod though, this is a good pick. Just make sure to set the drag when you've got a big fish on, and do not try and tough your way out of tree branches/ snags as you would with bigger poles."
2,A disappointment...,"I bought catnip bubbles for my cats once before and my cats really liked them. I was excited when I received the Cosmic Cat Catnip Bubbles, but that quickly changed. I thought it was me, but I could not blow more than one small bubble or one large bubble which immediately popped. I thought I was out of practice and continued to try until I finally gave up. The cats certainly were not impressed. Then I received another bottle of catnip bubbles which I had ordered at the same time, only they were a different brand. Much to my delight, I was able to blow lots of bubbles over and over. So it wasn't me, it was the Cosmic bubble formula. I will not be buying Cosmic's brand again."
5,Every child should be sung to from this book,"I remember my mom singing ""A, You're Adorable"" to us when we were young. I even remember my dad singing it to us, though he'd never admit to it if you asked him today. Anyway, I was thrilled when I found that someone actually illustrated a book with the words to this sweet song! My daughter loves to hear me sing it to her, and the sound of it seems to calm her down. We often read/sing it right before bed as a lullaby. I would recommend this book to anyone... and if you don't know the tune, just make one up; your child will surely love it anyway. (My mom is tickled to know that I remember her warbling this song to us!)"
3,Fair - Could be Better,Fair general purpose maps but for obvious reasons lacks detail. It would be difficult to provide highly detailed maps of every country in the world but I was hoping for something in the middle. I used this CD for a recent trip to Mongolia and it worked well enough but did not have certain ponds and rivers. Would be nice if they can team up with Google Earth to make maps.
2,The Trojan Horse,"The information presented by Mr. Brodie is accurate, but his method is demonstrative of exactly what he is saying. A ""meme"" is a thought implanted by others to advance their agenda. Think of it as a sound bite. Memes that are easily implanted, he calls ""good"" memes. Because the word good has its origins in the word God, I got on my high horse right there on page 15! The example he used was the denigrative propaganda of Jews by the Nazis prior to WWII. I found nothing ""good"" in that! Also on page 15, he had a very shallow interpretation of three generations of shaming the child.He defines a Trojan Horse as a virus that looks innocuous, but carries with it deadly information, like the pleasant e-mails that crash your hard drive. Read this book carefully!"
2,it has been said before!!!!,Brodie didn't make this brillant discovery about the mind and how society influences it. It has all been said before and all Brodie has done is add a catchy name to it.
5,i have read all of the single star reviews,The single star reviews are strong evidence for what Brodie describes in this book. When Memes have a strong hold on people their denial and resistance would be strong when anyone shines a light on the presence of the meme.Understanding self without understanding the potential insight lost to memes is getting more and more difficult as communications are spread so broadly and so swiftly.Read the book and have the courage and strong intention to ask yourself for YOUR truth to show up.
2,Why are people so ignorant?,"The picture on the cover and being introduced by Wayne Dyer on PBS convinced me this would be a good book to read so I purchased it. Only to realize that I have known this all along, and nothing really surprising about Virus of the Mind. The only thing I learned was the word ""meme.""For someone like me, English is my third language. I realize how narrow people's perceptions are if English is your only language. It makes the people prime breeding ground for virus of the mind. If you learn a foreign language or even live in another country for a while, you will see the spreading of the virus through commercials, political ads, and even your friends.To truly understand Brodie's book, I challenge those young or able enough to travel abroad and live there for at least several months. You will really come back and understand the insidious viruses here at home and the viruses abroad. It will open your eyes."
4,NEW WAYS TO THINK ABOUT THINKING,"Richard Brodie's book caught Oprah Winfrey's attention for very good reasons. ""Virus of the Mind"" is a thoughtful, insightful book for the layperson. It offers real tools for evaluating the ""memes"" we are listening to and spreading every day. Brodie writes for readers of all levels and backgrounds about subjects/ideas that might have been left to scientists and academics. Brodie's memetic meme is a worthwhile one written from the right place."
5,Wonderful!!,"I love everything Larry McMurtry writes, but without a doubt, this is his finest since Lonesome Dove! I have been anxiously awaiting a new novel and this one was worth the wait! It's a dandy!!"
3,Not his best,"I still don't really know what to think of this novel. The characters show a lot of potential, but that is never realised. Some characters are great, but appear only briefly in the novel. Even the character of Mary Margaret, who has the potential to be one of McMurtry's best, falls rather short.When I was reading the novel, it often reminded me of an abbreviated novel: a great story which has all the flesh cut out. Pity."
1,Disappointed,"If anyone but Larry McMurtry had written this, I very much doubt it would have been published. I would classify the book as ""an expanded outline of a novel"" or a short story rather than a novel.What happened to the McMurtry who wrote ""Lonesome Dove?"" Has he become so infatuated with himself that he has forgotten how to tell a story and infuse flesh into his characters""I think the story here and the characters are a good basis for a decent novel. But ""killing off"" one his most potentially interesting characters -- Grandpa -- so early leaves you wondering why he was introduced in the first place. It gets worse with the treatment of the Indian and the priest.The hard cover edition is dreadfully short. Maybe it should have been classified as a short story. The book's large type and larger page margins do not make a novel.Come on McMurtry, you are capable of so much more."
1,Boone's Lick,"A BIG disappointment. It's not much more than an expanded outline for a made-for-TV movie (287 large print & wide margin pages). I made myself finish it only because I had $24 invested in it and wanted to see if it was bad all the way through as it was in the beginning. It was! It has good potential for the development of memorable characters, but McMurtry didn't come through as he usually does. The story was boring and I really didn't care if the Cecil family made it to Wyoming or not. Bottom line: I felt this was presented to the American public as a commercial venture to entice the Christmas shoppers to spend some more of their money and to fill the pockets of the publishers and McMurtry. I'm sorry I fell for their tactics and I am VERY disappointed that McMurtry would present such a weak piece of work to his loving readers!"
2,They don't fit!,I really can't believe it! I don't consider myself to have a large head. I even have another pair of headphones that are like these and they fit. I really just wanted a better quality headphone. Are they making these for kids only? Was there a note in the description that says you should have a small head in order to use these? Thank goodness they weren't that expensive. I guess this is one time that going to the store and trying headphones on is the way to go for this style of headphone.
5,Pure Purple,Love this Parfum! Can't find it in stores anymore and was pleased I could get it online. My husband loves it too. He even wears it!
5,Exceeded Expectations,"Experience couldn't have been better: simplicity in ordering, shipped in time, arrived on time (should be noted that I reside outside US), exceptional value. Product comes in 3 colors but was surprised that shipment included one of each -- usually comes in whatever colors available, sometimes 3 of same. If I could change one thing it would be the ability to pay using PayPal, but I understand the corporate conflict."
2,I feel like I've been here before,"I enjoyed reading it, so maybe two and a half or three stars.That being said, much of what I liked about this book was borrowed and adapted from Robert Penn Warren's classic ""All the King's Men""."
2,childish,"I was disappointed with this story,as it was silly and childish. The ending left me cold, and the characters were one dimensional.I had enjoyed ""The General's Daughter"" immensely, but this book as well as ""Plum Island"" did not live up to expectations."
2,The Mold Coast,"This is my first and last DeMille book. After plodding through 630 pages where very little happens, I am left wondering how DeMille became such a blockbuster author. Are his other books better? I am stunned by the number of 5 star reviews here. The writer seems to think that a regional history lesson and overstuffed descriptions compensate for unbelievable characters and a thin story. Athough DeMille tells us it's a satire, I suspect that's just his way of trying to repackage a boring, unsuspenseful thriller.The pompous, self-congratulatory foreward by the author doesn't help either. If you're going to compare yourself to Tom Wolfe and F. Scott Fitzgerald, you'd better have the goods to back it up. Gatsby must be rolling over in his grave."
5,Nelson DeMille's 'The Gold Coast',"I am a late-comer to Nelson DeMille's work. I enjoyed the sharp humour and witty insights into the interaction between a brash, modern 'culture' and the remnants of an ossifying, elite, wealthy society in the throes of extinction in the 21st Century. I found the novel amusing and engrossing and I recommend it."
2,Good premise but became slow reading,"The idea of this book is a fantastic one-- Mafia don moves next door to snobby ""uppah crust"" couple whose lives are the last of a dying breed. They all should have been living in 1930 in an 80 room mansion, and the accumulation of details on this dying lifestyle at first was fascinating but then began to bog down. The couple's unusual sex life (anywhere and everywhere, on a horse or on a statue) became tiresome and the man's repeated rude wise-cracking to the Mafioso became more and more annoying, plus the beautiful, rich wife became boring to me. I wish this book had been cut back about 30% to get to the story, and I wish the characters had more going for them. They seemed so vacant I couldn't care."
1,So slow to develop that I gave up,Don't get this one. ALL of Demilles's other books are much more entertaining. This is not a page turner. It's torture to get to the next chapter where you are just hoping something actually happens... but half way through the book nothing ever did. Snore!
4,DeMille tackles a new subject,"I read the paperback edition, and thoroughly enjoyed DeMille's new endeavor. There are no terrorists, just a narrative by white upper class male who's reached middle age and has started evaluating his life.I found the story a little slow going at first, but I think that that was due, in part, to being used to his tales beginning a bit more dramatically. He does a great job of fleshing out his characters; he even manages to humanize the mafia don.One note of caution, I would avoid reading the foreword before the novel. Although most of it describes why he wanted to write this kind of book, he also gives a little hint of the ending.If you're expecting a lot of international intrigue or territorial crime fighters, this is not a book for you. If you enjoy suspense and a rather in depth look at some different lifestyles away from glitz, I think you'll enjoy this one."
3,Odd Bedfellows: Long Island's Gold Coast meets the Mafia,"A mafia don buys an estate next to a monied gold coast couple, a lawyer married to a society girl. There goes the neighborhood. The neighbors become an unlikely duo both riding a parallel path of destruction. Being mafioso is not what it used to be. A man's work used to be his bond, and loyalty meant character. But now nobody can be trusted. The old days are gone. Likewise, the great estates are dying, being broken up into two acre parcels. The society duo cannot keep it together. Their land is being sold and their marriage is faltering. The don and the duo's lives become intertwined, but the story told is rather predictable. The history of the Gold Coast is nicely woven into the tale, but the tale itself falls flat. The book is an enjoyable read, but never delivers on its early promise of a truly exciting story."
5,Revisited one of my favorite authors,"Wasn't The Gold Coast on the NYT best-seller's list in the 90's? Recently, I decided to reread this story. Just as clever and compelling as I remembered. DeMille has to be my all-time favorite author. When you are finished with this book, move on to The General's Daughter. The movie is good. The book is better."
3,Good read,"A fun, quick read. Not great literature but still enjoyable. Much better than the sequel, The Gate House. I will continue to read DeMille when I want as light bit of reading."
1,"Thin, breakable plastic, no room for double DVDs","The price is totally cheap, and that&#65533;s just what sort of product / construction and materials you will get too! I had won this as a door prize, what a wreck, the thin plastic breaks and shatters (much like other products from the manufacturer). The edges of the plastic are also very sharp and I have given myself a cut at some point. From the picture on the front slip that the tower comes in, it looked like a good design, nope, DVDs are difficult to slip in and out of the slots and there is no room for double DVD cases. Skip this product!"
1,Cheap,This product is not strong enough to hold up my lamp shade...it kept falling off the light bulb under the weight of the shade. Went to the big box store and got a much better version of this product for under $5.
3,Too heavy on my stomach..,"The taste is more than fine with me and I am so satisfied with this product , I mainly got this for mood improvement and hormonal balance . It did achieve hormonal balance , now i get my periods on time without much spotting before or after , the two downsides it has is that if i take full does it gives me headachs, not sure why as it is not listed on side effects that are common , second thing it makes me bloated big time .. salmon fish is more appropriate with me I will not rebuy, but i will continue to use it like three times a week for hormonal balance effects and only take half the dose.."
4,"Fun book, despite far fetched plot!!!","I absolutely love Sophie Kinsella and I have read all of her books, after reading Shopaholic and Sister, I was a bit disappointed by some of the far fetched things Becky went through, and I when I began The Undomestic Goddess, I had thought I was going to feel the same way about this book. When Samantha picks up and leaves her life because of one mistake she has made, I was thinking oh no here we go again. But I am happy to say the book turned around. Throughout the book I was always thinking how can you just leave your life and not return to your apartment, but Samantha is great. The love interest, Nat, is great also. He is just a regular guy, he's not over the top like many male characters are in chick-lit books. It made me laugh at many points and I wanted to know what was going to happen next. The only thing I am hoping is that Sophie decides to write a sequel because I am dying to know what was in the letter Nat wrote to Samantha."
5,Loved It!!!!!!,I read Amy's review and have to say; Oh get real! This was one of the funniest books I have read. I laughed out loud many times. It is suppose to be over the top...it has nothing to do with reality or the working woman although I can see some of my friends in Samantha who need to slow down and get a life. Enjoy the book and don't look for hidden meanings or reality. It is FUNNY!!!!
2,A Little Disappointing,"Following the ""Shopaholic"" series, I found this book to be kind of a letdown. I bought it in hardcover solely on the strength of how much I enjoyed the ""Shopaholic"" books and was disappointed. This is not to say that the book is not entertaining; just not quite as much as Ms. Kinsella's earler works. Buy the paperback!"
5,Great Book,I've read everything Sophie Kinsella has written and this is one of my favorites. I found myself laughing out loud at some points. I can't wait untill her next one comes out.
1,Predictable and simplistic.,"I took a chance on this book and was completely let down.I could have written this in a weekend, it was that predictable and silly. I knew the entire plot by the time I got to page 20. The relationships are murky and unresolved. The main character is vapid beyond belief and unbelievable in her stupidity. She can't operate a washing machine, boil an egg or iron a shirt, yet we're supposed to believe she can swing multi-million dollar deals.There was ZERO chemistry between Samantha and Nathaniel. The characters are cardboard cutouts, stereotypical dummies, molded to fit this ridiculous storyline.I think my IQ actually dropped from reading this.What a clunker of a book."
4,"Not a chick lit fan, but I thoroughly enjoyed this one...","I found this book on the shelf at a vacation rental in the south of France - and really loved it! It's not the kind of book I would pick up at home, but maybe now I will. Samantha was so thoroughly appealing - a heroine with character and spark - that I couldn't put it down. I read it by the pool, I read it in bed. I hated when it ended. I you are seeking a light story with some interesting plot twists, a bit of fun, and a truly likable character, read this book. The love interest is a great character, too. I will be looking for more reads from Sophie Kinsella."
4,Delightful Afternoon Read,"Ever since the first Shopaholic book first came out, I was instantly hooked on Sophie Kinsella. Although this book has nothing to do with the Shopaholic series, it's just as fun to read. Poor Samantha is an overworked lawyer who simply cannot relax and or do anything else but work. That is until she stumbles upon the home of the Geigers who happen to think she is applying for the housekeeping position. She can't cook, clean or even sew on a button but Samantha does get hired on as their housekeeper and the fun begins. This book was an absolute joy to read and I highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for a fun afternoon read."
3,Since it is Kinsella...,"...it is a good book, however after reading all four Shopaholics and ""Can You Keep a Secret"" I thought this one didn't quite hold up to the standard she has set with those. While the book was entertaining and could teach us all a lesson about slowing down, I guess I missed the ditzy humor that ran throughout her other novels. I would still recommend this read, however it is a bit of a let down if you're expecting something along the same lines as her others."
3,Different strokes,"My sister recommended this. It was kind of cute. Watching the type AAA lawyer get booted and end up in the back-of-beyond was the highlight of the story for me. Speaking as a professional caterer, just a little too much suspension of disbelief was required to manage to turn someone who has never boiled water into an honest-to-goodness chef in three months. Characters are not terribly well-developed but then they can't be; it just wouldn't work in this kind of story. Great beach read, for those so inclined."
2,not up to normal standard.,"I found this book abit slow, and i got frastrated with it. The main charector seems abit silly. Not one of Kinsellas better stories."
5,Chick Lit Above The Rest...,"Not since Bridget Jones: The Edge Of Reason have I been consumed by a book like I was with Sophie Kinsella's The Undomestic Goddess. I couldn't stop reading it.Kinsella does an amazing job of coupling female insecurities with humor. Her work surpasses the fiction of other ""chick lit"" writers. Even though she places her characters in seemingly ridiculous and far-fetched situations, they are so well written and presented that it's easy to fall for the plot.As a woman who has quite a lot of anxiety about managing work and a personal life, I immediately related to the main character of Samantha Sweeting.My advice to you: read the first few pages. If you're not immediately engrossed by Samantha's tale, then this book isn't for you. But, I have yet to meet anyone who didn't want to read the book after they read the first chapter."
3,UnRealistic Goddess,"I am a big Can You Keep a Secret fan, so I was looking forward to a SK book that wasn't part of the Shopaholic series. The book is very cute and also interesting, but totally unrealistic. Of course, SK's books are all a bit unrealistic, but this one is plain silly. The book tries to end about 3 or 4 times before actually coming to a conclusion. It was a cute book but fell apart at the end. If you like SK, you'll prolly be able to look past the flaws, and you'll like this book. I wish that I'd borrowed it from the library instead of purchasing it, though."
2,Silly!! Not typical of her great reads.,"What a silly book! I love Kinsella's other books, particularly the Shopaholic series, but geez...the situations in this book are laughable (and not because they're funny). Although I made it through the book, it was not a pageturner and I was not drawn in by the characters or situations. Even if you're a fan of Sophie's like I am, skip this one."
5,You'll enjoy every moment!,Sophie Kinsella sends us yet another winner with The Undomestic Goddess! Samantha is so funny as she leaves her perfect life behind and becomes a MAID! I laughed so hard I was in tears in several places as she tried to do things! Definately a wonderful read!
4,Worth the read...,"sort of a ""chick book"", but very entertaining... well worth reading. recommended!!"
4,The Undomestic Goddess,I thought the book was very entertaining and it definately held your interest. Can't wait for the spin off!
4,A Lovely Summer Read,"This book was a lovely summer love story that, while predictable, still sweet. With hilarious comic relief and a steamy love making session, Sophie Kinsella has done it again."
3,a little on the cheap side,belt kept coming apart; survived one use; probably better options out there. fairly cute with the wig and glasses. would buy differently next time
3,I love MARCIA,"I love Shining Time for the most part. My favorite is the song with Beres Hammond, and of course the title song. I am not so crazy about the dancehall songs. This definitely feeds my M.G. cravings. Her best recent work though, to me is still her version of Special Occasion from the cd Retrorespeck, and the song with Freddy McGregor, We'll Be Together I think is the name of it"
1,What a waste,For FREE this isn't worth it. LOOK at something else. Mines at goodwill now and I feel bad for giving it to them.
3,no more than what paid for,"The comforter serves its purpose, was not expensive. Has been in use about one week."
4,Feather Comforter King,"For such a low price excellent comforter. I love it, I'm using it for over 2 months and no complains. It is not too heavy. All you need is comforter cover and you will sleep like a baby."
4,Overall Fabulous but...,"First of all, let me say that I truly loved Half-Life. It was the very first game that my husband and I bought for our first computer and it was wonderful! The graphics were truly amazing, the storyline was great, and the progression was very good also. It was well worth the 40 dollars I paid for it.However, there were a few problems. Because the game is so layered, multidimensional and realistic, I felt it was necessary to have the guide book to walk me through it. For me, the game was impossible to play with out it. The other thing I didn't like was the ending of the story. I won't spoil it for any one but I will say that I felt the creators just sort of gave up at the end. The last few levels and especially the way it ends are very abrupt. I thought it would be a lot better than it was. So--in some ways it was a let down.But--overall this is a truly great game. It was definitly worth the money and the time! I would definitly recommend it!"
3,Don't Buy,"This edition (and no edition of Half-Life) allows you to play online multiplayer. You'll be forced to download Valve's Steam client (211 MB for HL alone), then the latest game patch (64 MB). That's a total of at least 265 MB of download! Valve offers NO texh support, either by contacting them or through message boards. If you someohow screw up your registration, you will not be able to play online. Valve will not help you fix your registration problem, nor any other problem. Also, cheaters abound in multiplayer and Valve has done nothing to address this. Valve is not a company to do business with. Lastly, this game gets old fast. You'll be bored with it in less than 2 weeks! You'd be better off buying Quake III Arena from ID software, which has none of these problems."
2,F**KING GREAT,this is one of the best game i have ever played. the wepons are good and it is fun to shoot the monsters. it is a good game you should buy it. you should buy every half life game that is out and that comes out
5,Great game,I BOUGHT THIS GAME LAST WEEK AND IT IS ALREADY ONE OF MY FAVES. yOU CONTROLL A CHARACTER CALLED GORDON FREEMAN WHO IS TRYING TO ESCAPE FROM THE BLACK MESA COMPOUND BECAUSE IT HAS BEEN INVADED BY ALIENS AND GOVERMENT FORCES. IN THE GAME YOU GET MANY GUNS INCLUDING SHOTGONS AND A ROCKET LAUNCHER. I ADVISE EVERYONE TO GET A COPY OF THIS GAME.
5,Great,"This story is hilarious, but also shows a lot about our current culture. It's a must see for anyone who loves 'ghetto culture' but it shouldn't just be limited to that. It shows us how three boys come to idolize the black community, while never setting foot in it. It's an eye opener, but the real strong part of this film is not the pschycology behind it, but rather the humor. It's hilarious and the crazy white kids in it are enough to get me to declare it an instant classic (well, not really, but it's still pretty cool...)"
4,A little more to it.,"There are certain phases every one goes through in regards to their race. For whites it starts with a denial that racism exists, then moves to a realization that inequalities exist between whites and other races, especially blacks. At this point most whites recede to their previous viewpoints and identify with whites even more strongly in order to deal with the negative emotions that facing these unpleasant facts evokes. There are more stages but that is all we need for this movie. The film is a study of what happens when, instead of identifying with their own culture, someone identifies with the oppressed culture. Flip is not aping the black culture because it is the cool thing to do. He is doing it to deal with the guilt thrust upon him from the actions of his ancestors. It is all in the monologue at the end. Overall a great movie. Funny and thought provoking."
4,I really enjoyed it!,"I think it was refreshing to see Doug and Kate, the parents, having grown into such wonderful supportive parents. I was upset to find out that the original characters had not been signed to do this movie, but the replacements were VERY good. I loved the Alex character, although the Jackie character was a little dissapointing. I don't really know anything about competitive figure skating other than it is a beautiful thing to watch but I really enjoyed this film. (Not as much as the first) but hey, at least this one finally let us know for sure Doug and Kate won gold!!! Yea!"
3,good... but not near as good as,"The first one is a great movie and I must have seen it a dozen times. Saw this version on TV and thought it was made for TV (after school style). However, it did catch me and if you loved the origional you'll like this movie. If you were blah on the first, you'll hate this one. Appreciate it for the theme, not the story line, or even the acting. Everyone is atractive and if nothing else the female lead does work her eyes well."
5,very unique dragon design...,"My family has been a fan of T-shirts made by The Mountain for several years now. We love the fact that the shirt itself is usually mottled or tye dyed and not plain, the design is actually IN the shirt and not like a stiff decal, and the shirts are soft, comfortable and get softer with every wash. I have several mountain shirts that I've worn and washed/dryed well over 100 times and they look great. I've bought 40+ mountain shirts and have never had one unravel at the seams or be defective. They are built to last.As to this particular design-I bought this design my 10 year old for school wear. He is a dragon fan, collects dragons and also loves oriental stuff. He loves this shirt and had several kids at school remark on his ""cool"" shirt:). The design is beautiful and LARGE-it does cover the entire front of the shirt. The shirt itself is charcoal grey. A must for your dragon fan.5 stars-recommended."
4,Fairly good,"The on going continuation of the original Bubblegum Crisis. This gives a few last episodes of what was going on in the series. You don't have to buy it to understand the last of the series, but I highly recommend getting it just for the last episodes."
1,Broken piece of glass,"This item is made of very thin crystal. It arrived broken. It is a waste of money. August 9, 2,009"
3,Buyer beware,Most people consider a cup as 8 oz. That is not the case with this product description. Change the product description to standard US measurements and it will get 5 *****.
2,"Maybe I am too fussy, but.......","I don't understand why people would like this product. I was going to order a very expensive automatic coffeemaker, the Technovorm Moccamaster, but at a price over $200, I thought I would try a French press first. I am very disappointed. I am a rule to the letter follower, so I know I did it exactly right. The coffee isn't even hot when I immediately pour into the cup as soon as the recommended four minutes are up. Also, I make sure the water is as hot as specified by using a thermometer to check the temperature. The coffee is muddy and it tastes heavy. I can make a cup like this in my Mr. Coffee. I guess I will continue to stop by Dunkin Donuts until I want to spend the extra money on the Techovorm."
2,"Nice press, until it breaks","The press works well and filters most of the grounds out. As others have mentioned, a coarse grind works best. I love having a french press for the quality of the coffee and convenience. This one is made from some seriously shoddy glass, though. I've had IKEA glasses that are tougher than this. I replaced the beaker after the first break, assuming it was just a defective unit. But the second time it broke while just sitting in the top rack of the dishwasher. Must've been the temperature changes.If you buy this, expect to shell out money for new beakers in the future. And take a look at the replacement prices on Amazon - they aren't cheap."
3,very disappointed,"Remember the saying ""where's the beef?"" When I opened this tin container I asked, ""where are the tea leaves?"" This looks like the inferior product they put in the bags. We had our first tea pot this evening and it's tolerable, but then so are tea bags. I'm so terribly disappointed in this product. I will not buy it again."
2,bought into the hype,"I bought this dvd assuming it was going to be great. Shawn White is an excellent rider and the reviews were mostly 5 stars. I ws kinda dissapointed when i first saw it. the soundtrack isn't that great, mostly older songs from the early 90's i think. The riding wasn't all that great either and was more like a videography on shawn white. it didn't show much af any other riders and the special features were like watching a target commercial."
2,A Fable out of Thin Air,I was really disappointed in the writing style used in this book. I have been reading Jude's books for well over 20 years. It seemed like she was dictating a silly fable out of thin air. I will definitely think twice about her next book.Carrie
1,Not Impressed,"What was she thinking?!!Is this supposed to be a romance novel???I have read nearly all of Ms Deveraux's books and loved the earlier ones. The later ones, especially this one, I was not impressed with. The female characters are terrible, especially the cousin. The woman is a real whiner.And there seemed to be parts missing, parts that make it a romance novel. This was supposed to be RJ and Sara's romance, so then, where is the romance?? Romance between them was sadly lacking. No kissing, absolutely nothing! And what about professing their love for each other?!What happened in the cave, for goodness sake?!!!How Sara gets pregnant is a mystery.The secondary characters, Ariel and David had a better time in my opinion.I felt thoroughly cheated with this book. Much preferred her Velvet Series and Knight in Shining Armour. They were keepers."
3,beach reading and that's it!,"I hadn't read her books before and from this one, well, doubt I'll venture into another one anytime soon. I was at the beach bookstore and picked up this book for reading in the sand. It was an ok story but I just couldn't get past the cousins looking like twins-part. It was a fast read but nothing extraordinary."
2,Wow! So Disappointed!!,"Usually love her writing and I just finished a few books by Judith McNaught, which I couldn't put down. So, when I read about a third of this today, I began flipping to the back to see if anything got more exciting and it didn't appear that it was going to be that great. Too bad I didn't get it from the library and bought it instead. After reading the other reviews, I won't waste my time finishing this book. It's going to Goodwill."
3,so-so,"I liked this book.....kind of. It was far-fetched that the 2 cousins could switch and no one would notice. It's also inconsitant in places. Like when Ariel, after pretending to be Sara, was in jail but had ALL of her jewerly on - like R.J. wouldn't have noticed that right off. And then when I finally started to like Sara and R.J.'s characters and they start talking after they fall, it jumps to Ariel and David. By the time it gets back to the other two they have had sex(?)????? I felt like I missed something - like HOW they worked everything out.And I didn't like that EVERYONE got hurt but the miss-priss Ariel who just happened to be able to save the day...talk about a complete turn-around.Other than that, I found that I sort of liked the book, but it's definitely not one I plan on keeping. Save your money and get it from the library."
2,"Jude, what the heck happened???","Wow. What can I say about this one?? How about rushed to print, undeveloped characters, strange and screwy plotline, abrupt ending, . . .I have been a Jude Deveraux fan for a long time, and I have most, if not all of her books. This one was a disappointment, to say the VERY least!!!I am giving it two stars solely for the author. Written by anyone else, it would get no stars at all. She desperately needs to rewrite this one, this time increasing the depth of the characters and the plot, and changing the ending so that it ends with more than a ''Huh, what??''!!!!"
1,How could this book be by THE Jude Deveraux?????????,"I kid you not, I looked at the cover of this book, front and back, more than once, to make sure it was REALLY written by my favorite romance author, Jude Deveraux. This book was SOOOOOOO disappointing. It had no character development, no witty banter and dialogue, and a thrown together undeveloped plot. I felt like it was written by a schoolgirl! Maybe it's a book she wrote when she was a teen and they decided they just HAD TO publish it? I can't believe it was so bad. I'm so crushed. I just reread ""Rememberance"" again the other day and enjoyed it so much...but then to read this and be so disillusioned! I hope ""First Impressions"" is better...I just bought it and if it's as bad as Caroline Isle...well, I won't be paying for hardbacks any more, I can certainly tell you that!!"
1,skip this one,"I have been a fan of Jude Deveraux books from her very first book. Her first twenty or so books are wonderful and I own them all, but lately I have no idea what has happened to her. I have to agree with another reviewer who wrote this is written on a high school level. I would have to agree it is like a Nancy Drew novel. The characters never develop and the story is down right childish. If Ms. Deveraux wants to write mysteries, she should read a McNaught or Garwood novel, they are all wonderful. If you want to read Deveraux try: The Summerhouse, The Duchess or The Princess, some of my favorites."
4,Good enough read....,"I haven't been reading Jude for long, but I enjoyed the last few books I've read of hers, including this one. It's an interesting plot to begin with, then turns a bit predictable, but still worth reading.It made me laugh and smile. I think Jude has a good sense of humor and writes her male characters with a bit of cynicism, but the enjoyable kind, not the insufferable type. She writes the woman involved with a good sense of humor and well rounded enough to put him in his place yet is still emotionally involved to which other women can relate.I enjoyed it. The mystery is something you want to get to the bottom of. Keep it in mind and give it a chance."
1,Silliest book I've ever read.,"I am such a fan of Jude Deveraux, but this could turn me off for good. Absolutely the silliest, most scattered story I've ever read. Stupid plot, dialogue which makes no sense, and unbelievable (in a bad way) story line. Advertised as two cousins changing identities?? This lasts for an hour.I want my money back!"
4,A good model/toy of the Imperail Shuttle,"With Star Wars Action Fleet, MicroMachines produced one of the best line of toys/models that I have ever seen. These were made with a great balance between fidelity and durability. Yes, these were primarily toys, but they were great models as well.The Imperial Shuttle is 6"" tall, 6"" long and 4"" wide (with wings folded up). The hatch opens to fit the poseable pilot, the laser rotate, and the wings fold up for landing which also deploys the landing gears.This is a great model for the avid collector and a great toy for the young at heart."
1,Terrible for hair,This comb will ruin your hair in no time. The tips are sharp and ragged.It is sure to give split ends. The metal ring around it catches your hair and breaks it off. It is a poor design and I wouldn't recommend it to my worst enemy!
5,Love this book-Simple Abundance,"This book helped me through some tough and confusing times about 10 years ago. I read it daily for 3 years-underlined, high lighted...only added to its charm. I recently gave a copy to my 28 y/o daughter for her birthday and SHE also loves it! Thanks author Sara!"
5,Delightful experience!,"I just love this book. Each day's entry is thought-provoking, inspirational and heart-warming. Like Lays Potato Chips, I can't read just one entry per day!"
3,"Good, But Not Original","Gothic done well, but not terribly original. The vocals are excellent and sound exactly like Peter Murphy...hopefully not on purpose. The music is similar (sometimes) to Bauhaus. If I heard this CD without knowing who it was, I would think it was Bauhaus re-united in 2000. I also think it wears out it's welcome in length. If you want gothic music that's not cheesy, pick it up. Just don't expect to hear anything new!"
2,"Disappointed with this CD, sorry.....","I listened to the CD all the way through and will soon post it for sale as a used item at Amazon.com, so watch for it there. I was disappointed with the sameness of the sound and the blandness of the production. Where the music could have reached out and grabbed me it seemed to simply sit there lifeless. I found myself thumbing through a magazine as I kept losing patience waiting for something exciting to happen.I have a great many goth and goth-ish CDs in my collection but this one will not be one of them, sorry."
5,Osi's Debut Album Whisper Not,"I am so excited to have discovered this new talent via Amazon.com!!! Osi's voice smoothly takes you along great jazz classics from Godson's ""Whisper Not"" to an unconventional ""Love Look Away"" to a tearjerking Piaf song ""Rien De Rien"". Once u finish, u not only feel likw you know Osi, but u want more, more, and more later. Her chords are angelic, free, daring, ring of the human spirit. I WANT A SECOND ALBUM soon because the joy contatined on her debut is not enough for me, and I am sure for millions of listeners to come!!!"
5,Fantastic addition to the d20 genre,"Want to beef up your warrior? Want to make him (or her) the best of the best? Buy this book! It is the reference all of us d20 gamers have always wanted, and it's finally here!"
