5,Absolutely Good PDA,"I bought this product roughly a year ago. Since it was my 1st PDA it was hard to get used to at first, but then I got the hang of it... Compared to the others on the market I think this si the best. Its display is the main feature, compared to other Handheld PC's this is a really great alternative at a really affordable price.What are you waiting for?GO GET ONE!"
4,Excellent but bulky,"I bought the Prism because of Handspring's generally good reputation and because Palm at that time had not come out with a color version of the V. I am generally pleased with the Prism, except for a) its bulkiness; b) lack of flip cover and c) weight. I love the look and feel of the Palm m505 but have heard nothing but horror stories so am waiting until Palm (or Handspring) comes out with a thin RELIABLE color unit. I have upgraded my Prism with a VisorPhone, which I also like, service through Voicestream has been reliable and pretty fast. I also bought the Backup Module and am thinking about another 8MB or 16MB of memory, because many apps I wish to use will not fit into the original 8MB. The unit is much faster than the earlier Visors. I also wish it had a clock utility like the newer Palms do, I like that a lot. I would recommend this unit, however, but beware of its weight and thickness."
4,"Bright, beautiful screen! Is it a PDA or just plain fun?","I finally upgraded to an official personal digital assistant after finally deciding to part with my trusty Sharp Wizard. The Prism was a good choice. I purchased a Palm 505m for a friend for Christmas, so I've been able to side-by-side compare the two. Palm looks cooler, hands down. But Handspring has a workhorse feel to it. (I'm trying out some games on it and it's great fun. I'd say it rivals Gameboy, but hey, what does a 50-year-old know about handheld games?!) Between the two, the Prism's color screen is far and away the best. Holds up well even in daylight. I'm still getting to know all its tricks (quite a step from the Wizard), but I feel confident I made the right choice. By the way, I found these reviews on Amazon very helpful in making the selection between the Palm and Handspring. Believe the owners!"
3,Wheeler's Dental Anatomy,"Dental anatomy is a tough subject to learn. The human dentition varies from person to person and from race to race. If you truly want to learn dental anatomy a text book by itself is not enough. Use models, typodonts, extracted teeth, and your own patients to further your understanding. You might have to purchase such items by yourself. You have to gain knowledge through experience. This book (previous edition, old exams, and dental decks) helped me to achieve a 99 percentile on NDBE Part I. I can't believe the lack of professionalism from the previous reviewers. They are an embarrassment to the profession of dentistry. Who cares if you are #2 in the class, too bad you are not #1 (Then we can take you seriously!). I would recommend this book only as a supplement to the learning of dental anatomy. You can not learn all there is about dentistry from a text book! Dental school only gives you the basics."
5,o.k.,"Very good conditions, the CD that was suppose to be attached with the book didn't come, it would have been nice that it had been specified in the product description. Otherwise I'm very satisfied."
5,Dental Anatomy,The book is great with helpful pictures and interactive cd and as a dental student very helpful to order online.
4,one of the better biographies on Rommel,"This book might be a good example of what a great historian David Irving might have been if he didn't get so twisted and anti-Semitic about the Jews and the Holocaust. This biography I thought, was pretty good work on Germany's most famous general (at least to the west). Irving's research proves to be quite good, its well written and very readable. The context of the book was quite informative as well. Its the only Irving book I have in my library and its there for its own merit despite of the author's personal reputation which have been trashed by his own effort."
1,The monitor gives erratic readings,"I recently purchased this Lifesource BP monitor and had to return it immediately because the readings were erratic and the product isn't reliable at all. I tried it on my wife and myself and the device wouldn't give reasonable readings. We followed all the instructions as per the manual and also tried fitting the monitor in different places on the wrist, it still couldn't give accurate readings.I wouldn't recommend buying this product unless you have tried it before making the purchase and compared the readings with the readings at your doctor's office."
5,MY SWEET BIBLE,This was only the New Testament... but love it anyway. i can keep this one in my desk at work..
3,Not what I expected,"These bibles come in two sizes, a pocket version and a larger version. I was expecting the larger version and received the pocket-sized edition. I had to send them back."
3,"Better, but not the best","The 4th edition is much better than the 3rd mainly due to its readability (the color is nice too). The ease of use and understandability is still not up to the level of Nelson and Cox's ""Lehninger."" MBC does cover more basics than the Lehninger, but it is less intuitive and more diffucult to read."
2,"good illustrations, bad writing","I don't understand any of these other reviewers. The book has lots of colorful illustrations, and the thickness make the book look comprehensive, but the writing seems to need more organization. Surely it could have been written more concisely. Incredibly boring to read through."
1,Overrated =P,"Maybe the following comment is a result of the fact that the UCI dept mandates that the students buy the book for the BIO 109 course. Whatever the case, this is one of the worst bio books I've ever read. Their explanations were confusing and there were major typos/mistakes w/in the flow charts they presented in the chart."
3,"Too much author opinion, too few details.","It's good for quick referance, and there's a lot of content, but detail is somewhat lacking and the manner in which some information is presented can be misleading at times. Additionally, the author interdicts his opinion in several instances as fact in regards to which vehicles are better than the others instead of allowing the reader to draw that conclusion for themselves, which I felt lead to the book occassioanlly being self-contradictory."
1,Not worth the money!,"This is one of my textbooks for my classes this year. For $73, one would expect to find color pictures, well written text, and current information, however, this book lacks all of these. Published in 1990, the info is at least ten years old. I can't believe they charge this much for a book. It is not Amazon's fault, it is the publisher."
5,Excellant condition,Book was received on time and in great condition.Thank You!! Book was received on time and in great condition.Thank You!!
3,that is not a grammar error,"As a rebuttle to the prior review, I have not ordered this program, but I would like to make a correction. Using ""diga"" to answer the phone is very common in most spanish speaking countries. This may be confusing, but many words are conjugations of other words, and ""diga"" comes for ""Decir"" meaning ""speak."" The program is not wrong, but it may not be effective in explaining all pertinent information."
4,Strength and Glory Review,"This is a good book. And you have to read it to complete the series storyline. I don't think it is near as good as the first three though. It leaves you still hanging in parts of the story, or seems like she needs to do a related series. It is still a good book though."
1,RBD ....aun no aprenden a cantar,"Sin comentarios , recomiendo este album a todos los que NO les guste la musica"
4,different but I LOVE IT!,"THIS ALBUM IS REALLY DIFFERENT FROM THEIR PREVIOUS ALBUM. AT FIRST WHEN I BOUGHT IT I DIDN'T KNOW IF I WAS GOING TO LIKE IT BUT AFTER I LISTENED TO THE WHOLE ALBUM I REALLY LIKED IT. I THINK THEIR BEST SONGS ARE ""QUIZA"", ""CELESTIAL"" AND ""SER O PARECER"" I DEFINETLY RECOMMEND THIS ALBUM!"
5,"Looks good, sturdy and is comfortable to wear",I bought this armband a month back have used it regularly for running. I have no complains. I like its looks very much as it lets the iPod stand out and be visible rather than hiding the iPod behind a black case.When I bought I was concerned that the iPod might slip from the sleeve. I use it with the skin that comes with it which is pretty cool as it is a translucent white skin on iPod. It feels sturdy and there is no sign of slippage.Fits comfortably around the arm and the there is no problem sweat getting on the iPod.I would highly recommend it to anyone.
4,Works Fine,A nice easy attach to the bike and away we went. Sturdy construction and works just fine.
4,"Very Good Video Quality, Okay Audio, Okay Movie","If you review a Blu-Ray movie, please describe the audio/video quality.The video was very good. Not excellent for some reason, and I don't know why. My eyes could have just been tired, but the video did not look perfect. I would give it a ""nine"" on a scale from one to ten, with ten being perfect.The audio was ""DTS-HD 7.1 Master Audio"", and I don't know why. I remember only hearing sound from the surrounds once. There may have been more that I don't remember, but there wasn't much surround sound, so I don't know why they used 7.1. I do have a modern 7.1 system.The movie itself was okay, but not great."
1,"Could have been, should have been but it just wasn't",I certainly expected more based on the capable actors in this film and I would have to say it was collectively a big disappointment. I usually base my choice for movies by the actors in the movie but this one may have me rethinking that logic.
2,Strike Out,"Mr. Woodcock had such great potential but failed to deliver. There are some real heavy hitters in the cast.Billy Bob Thornton has the capacity to make any film a classic when directed properly. Although, he had his moments in this one.Susan Sarandon was probably not right for the part...OR...was right for the part if the film was executed correctly. She is a gifted and elegant actress who can make a role striking and memorable. This role was beneath her to say the least.Seann William Scott is a modern comedy genuis. He has the look, the resume and the chops to take a movie to the next level. He was also probably not right for this role. He belongs in Hollywood blockbusters, not forgettable films like Mr. Woodcock.Three terrific actors combined into one film should have been a winner but just couldn't do it. Three strikes."
4,Pretty dag gone funny,"This is a pretty decent flick, most of the funny parts were on the previews but it is a great story, and presented very well."
2,Unwatchable,It insulted my intelligence and consumed 38 minutes of my life before I realized what an abject waste of time this POS was.
4,worthy Beatles documentary,"No music here, but some great interviews and newsreel footage of the Beatles ascent to the heights of 20th Century musical greatness!"
4,Good but not as good as everyone raves here.,"Having purchased nearly everything Beatle related out there, I can tell you that this is a good DVD, but not great. Let me put it to you this way, if you have the Anthology DVD set, think of this as the bonus features for it. Many of the same interviews are duplicated in this DVD from the Anthology but most are extended so you get to see more of the interview that the Anthology cut away from.If you're a Beatles nut, this is excellent. If you're a casual Beatles fan, this is not for you, the Anthology is. As for the interviews on this DVD, be aware there aren't that many. It's not like the an hour of back-to-back interview/news footage. In fact, most of the DVD is just file footage as a narrator talks to take up some time and space.I give this DVD 4 stars. It's more like 3 1/2. If you're a Beatles enthusiast, I would try to rent it first because I don't really believe you'll want to watch this over and over again."
2,Raffi's only disappointment,"Our family loves Raffi, and we want to share him with you - just not this video. It's his only real disappointment. Try one of his other great classics instead.His band here has no drummer - a cheesy synthesizer carries the beat. They sound bad. He uses a second rate choir from a children for the environment group. The whole concert lacks the magic of his other CD's and videos.Instead, try the outstanding video, ""Young Children's Concert with Raffi,"" which captures Raffi at his best with children. Or try one of his many wonderful CD's, like ""Singable Songs for the Very Young; Great with a Peanut Butter Sandwich"" and ""Raffi in Concert with the Rise and Shine Band.""Our family loves Raffi, and so will you. His music is silly, fun to sing along with, and just right for little people. You'll enjoy any of his other CD's or videos, with a peanut butter sandwich."
3,"Wrong music, great performances",Someone has their Cds mixed up. This is piano music performed by Nicolai Demidenko. Wake up! This CD is great
5,Tough Mental Math for the Gifted,"This book would be great for gifted junior high and high schoolers, and smart, interested math-savvy adults. It is not for the faint of heart.The calculations Lucas expects you to perform and remember are not easy. For example, he asks you to calculate the logarithm of, say, 17 (base 10) by applying a Taylor series approximation in your head. I've been able to do it, but not without a fair amount of practice. Mathematically gifted children will love it for stretching their abilities, but this 36-year-old loves it as a way to improve his calculating abilities, impress his nerdy friends, and improve his memory of numbers."
3,doesn't hurt to try,"I do not expect any huge gains from a book of this type, but I did enjoy the read, and recommend it to anyone trying to better themselves."
4,Great Scanner/Muddled Software Bundle,"This scanner definitely lives up to its billing by most of the reviewers. I am a bit overwhelmed (and I'm very technically oriented)by the bundle of software that comes with it (photo scan/copy/pdf-color-BW-grayscale, etc). I have utilized most of it, but it seems too many windows/programs/utility choices pop up when you simply push one of the buttons on the scanner. The programs are robust enough, but what they do with 3 separate programs, they could have accomplished within one solid piece of software. I am working on black and white photos from the 1900's to about 1945 and the touchup utilities work pretty well. I would recommend this scanner, great for the price and good quality reproductions."
3,No good for negatives,"I bought a CanoScan 4400F primarily to use to scan in 35mm negatives. I should have done more research. While the 4400F includes a negative holder, it lacks the FARE feature which removes dirt, scratches and other artifacts from negatives. Even when I used compressed air to try and remove all the possible artifacts, it didn't provide good results. Returned product. Will try and find a comparably priced scanner with FARE or better yet, ICE technology."
4,Great scanner but no Linux support,"This is really a nice scanner. It's quick, small and generates nice output. I haven't tried the film strip adapter yet, but plan to do so.My biggest complaint is that there is no Linux support for this product. I know I should have checked before ordering, but I didn't and I'm quite disappointed that I need to boot into Windows in order to scan things."
3,Good,"works good but the features are not user friendly. A lot of Casing looks very cheap the adapter is not very compact, need a seperate power supply apart from the usb."
5,great image tool,The system is excellent. I've scanned in over 300 color slides and negativesand over 300 black and white negatives. The software is good quality and provides tools to make adjustments to the images. My goal is to digitize all the negatives I've been saving for over thirty years.
4,Cano Scan 4400F Scanner,"Quick, easy set-up. Scan quality high. As other owners noted, it is slow: s l o o o w. It helps teach you patience. An excellent value; a lot for the price."
5,Cool Scanner,I love my new scanner. I do not have a fax machine at home so now I scan my documents and fax/email them to other people.
1,Displeased with Canon,"I ordered this product to scan old photographic slides.Our computer utilized the Windows Vista operating system.According to the Canon instructions, I was supposed to download software from their website. After many hours of trial and error, e-mailing their ""technical support"" department and receiving partial answers, I packaged up this scanner and sent it back to Buy.Com.I completed a Canon consumer satisfaction survey (giving them my honest opinion) and was never contacted by them.No more Canon products for me !!!!"
4,Cannon Scanner.,This scanner is easy to set up and use. I find that Microsoft software is easier to use to edit the scanned 35 mm slides than the software that came with the scanner.
4,Nice Value,"This scanner is a good value - a little clunky but does the job. I wish there weren't so much software associated with it though - the installation is quite an ordeal.All in all though, it has some nice features, you can create files in pdf, jpeg and other formats, you can send directly to a printer or as an email attachment. Net net - a nice value."
4,Great for the money!,"I bought one of these just to scan my old photos (of which I have a lot). Works great with my Mac G4. Has a cool feature where if you put several pictures on the scanner (as long as they're not touching eachother) they'll scan in as seperate images! That's a big time saver.It also has negative scanning capabilities. I've used it and it's OK, good enough for me. But if you want to scan a lot of negatives and want great quality, WRONG scanner.Oh! Also, the lid is made so you can fit a big book on the scanner and it'll still close."
4,If you are a prog. music fan only,"Lands End is the kind of band who can produce the greatest progressive music albums.The music is just great. It's like a mix from the greatest band like Pink Floyd, Yes and Genesis.Unfortunatly, perhaps because of a lack of fund, the sound quality may bother some. It sound as if it was recorded really fast, with no money left to work on what has be done. There's a couple of ""wrong notes"" in some of the song too. Ashes is really good. But my favorite is ""Wake to find me dead"".So, in general, AN OLDER LAND sound like a big prog jam session. You'll like this album ONLY if you are a big progressive music fan, and also ONLY if mistake on a CD don't bother you."
1,Complete Nonsense!!!,"I bought this movie at a rummage sale ...I paid too much for it. It took me three days to watch it. Yes, it's that bad. Camp's acting is unorigional, labored, and unfunny. The rest of the cast (one of whom was in Strange Brew) is utterly forgettable. It's a movie about making a movie on an island where the locals are none-to-pleased that ""hollywood"" has taken over. Needless to say, the locals retaliate and hyginks ensue. Sounds like a typical b-movie plot but the movie makes ABSOLUTELY NO SENSE.The movie plays like there have been 5 minute segments edited out of every ten minutes of film. ..."
3,My 30 day review.,"I've only had this tv for one month,but so far I like it. All the features are working good. I especially like the full-featured remote. The built-in DVD player is nice. No problems at all."
5,Beautiful chairs,"Ordered these chairs for use on our second story deck. We are at the beach so we need something heavy enough to endure windy weather. These chairs look great, even better than I expected. They are heavy enough to sit still on our windy days, but not too heavy to prohibit moving them around easily. They are very comfy-I did buy small seat cushions for them since wooden chairs are not exactly soft. They are a great fit for me and for my husband, but might be a bit narrow for folks with heavier backsides. For our purposes, they are perfect and priced very well. I have not seen outdoor wooden chairs to compare to this price. I do plan to oil them every now and then."
2,They break,"Sorry, I tried, I'm heavy(250) and both of the chairs broke with normal use after a few weeks. I thought the first broke because I reached sideways to pick something up but the second one broke, too. the break point seems to be where the cross bars connect to the legs."
2,I dunno...,"At first, I got this system and was encouraged by their concept of adding weights to aerobics. If you count it up though, you're not getting a whole lot of cardio in any of these tapes, I don't think. Also, I read something from a dietician who said it's wiser to do your toning seperately. Also, it commented that they have you do lots of reps of weights, and when you hit 15 reps your not boosting your metabolism, your building endurance. Building metabolism is how weights help your weight loss, so I'm getting skeptical. Don't get me wrong, I was a Firm believer and I did use it faithfully, but I haven't been impressed. Also, don't EVER order from the Firm's website, they are idiots who I agree, DON'T CARE about their customers!"
3,The Moon is the Reason We Can't Teleport,"Long ago, humans evolved on another planet. They colonised other planets, then civilisation collapsed. The inhabitants of the planet of Mollan can travel from one planet to another with a thought, and live five thousand years. The gravitational influence of the moon is the reason Earthlings can't travel to other stars with a thought. A small group of radicals from Mollan plan to violate the noninterference policy by blowing up the moon."
2,Great material but bad camera work,"This video presented a chance to work along with a teddy master artist and become knowledgable about proper construction methods and learn a few secrets to help in making our own bears. For the money, a lot of the footage should have been reshot as many, many times the artist's hands were not even in the same area as the camera which panned here and there to try to find them and closeups that were on target, still had hands covering crucial technique because the camera angle was not correct. I also felt more attention could have been given to garment construction instead of assuming we would automatically all know how to do it. In spite of the everything, the artist's love of her craft, expertise, and pleasant personality were evident and I will attempt a bear in the near future but I am nervous about ordering any other vieos in this same series. END"
3,AN AVERAGE VAR BOOK,"This book well explains what is Value At Risk and the concept of risk management in banks. Business concepts are complete. The author gives a lot of weight in risk control.However, he lacks to give detailed examples on how to calculate VAR, the mathematics/statistics behind. Spreadsheets are nice but not complete from the beginning to the end. Important statistical methods are described without enough detail leaving the concepts out the book's scope."
1,Deeply disappointing.,"I have been reading erotica for almost 20 years. Some of it is always going to be better than others. But this collection was particularly poor in quality of writing, originality of ideas and general feel.I read the first six, and really have no desire to continue.The stories are negative (for the most part), whiny and really lack erotic merit -- ie, I never got turned on. I mostly spent time reading about vindicitive people or others who were un-balanced in their sexual orientation and burdened with hang-ups.Missing were unique, clever and moving sensual descriptions of physical and emotional erotic pleasure.Is this really the best American erotica there is to offer?I'm so sick of this apparent trend of cynicism and crankiness in contemporary writing."
2,Just OK,"This book wasn't what I was expecting. I was looking for something a little more everyday, run-of-the-mill sexy. Instead, I felt like I was reading material for a college Modern Lit class. I felt like I needed to do a character analysis at the end of every story, rather than feeling sexy."
5,A worthy edition of the first part of the Shahnameh,"This first volume (of a projected eight or nine) of the Khaleghi-Motlagh edition of the SHAHNAMEH includes Ferdowsi's (largely philosophical) introduction and the reigns of Shahs Kaiumars, Husheng, Tahmuras, Jamshid, Zohak, Feridun, Minuchihr, Nowzar, and Kai Kobad. There is an introduction to the series in general (in English) by Ehsan Yarshater of Columbia University, but the bulk of the book is entirely in Farsi. Almost every page is heavily annotated, with variant readings of nearly every line of the poem, based on numerous manuscript sources -- a sort of variorum edition, as it were.Such a splendid edition of this magnificent poem makes it well worth the effort of learning Farsi, just to read and savor it in the original -- which is what I'm trying to do right now! The price isn't exactly low, but those who love the SHAHNAMEH and can read Farsi will not be disappointed!"
1,Silly Brits Have No Clue,I picked this book up out of morbid curiosity. I simply had to find out what Brits have to say about entrepreneurship. The answer is nothing. This book is a juvenile attempt at conveying what's involved in starting a successful enterprise. The authors' approach is over simply and chock full of erroneous information. I don't mean to be xenophobic but there's very little the Empire can teach Americans about entrepreneurship and business.
2,keycad pro,old fashioned and rather dated CAD 2-D program. Pro: lots of templates for simple situations Con: not interactive and no hard copy manual.
2,"Garmin USB problems, DOES NOT WORK ON Mac or Mac Parallels","Garmin is very interested in protecting their software, vis a viz many different unlock keys etc. If you plan on using this with your Garmin GPS, good luck! Did not work well at all on my PC, then tried it on a Mac with Parallels, also did not work. Called Garmin's help line and the service pretty weak."
2,Not what its title suggests,"Glenn Gould was obviously an astonishing pianist and musician. He was also an isloated person who had difficulty being a social being. He is justly famous for the first fact; the second was a difficulty he had to endure. This film is not about Gould as a musician(there is actually very little music). Rather it is a semi voyeuristic attempt at drawing a picture of his personality using a mixture of acting and interviews with real people. The mixture doesn't work, and is, I believe, pointless and perhaps cruel. It is neither fish nor fowl, but rather, that most misleading of ""art forms"", the docudrama.If you love Gould's music this will not inspire you."
2,Too Artsy for me,"I tried my best to get into this, but about halfway through, I gave up. Despite the ""short"" nature of each segment, I found may of them dragged on with no point. If you like artsy black and white films where you get to try to guess what deep meaning the director had in mind for long stretches of nothing happening, this will be just your cup of tea, otherwise you will find your attention wandering."
5,Succeeds admirably at what it is,"What it isn't is a film bio/documentary. In a pointillistic, fragmentary way the filmaker allows you a sense of who Glenn Gould was in a way that I think Gould himself would have been pleased with given his own modus operandi in his radio scripts: the interaction of many voices- tiny fragments making a larger idea clearer in a way that a more prosaic approach would have failed. Best enjoyed by people who have at least a passing knowledge of who he was but an interesting and moving film by any standards. As noted by another reviewer here: more than the sum of its parts."
4,Not as good as Dinosaur Revolution,"This DVD is still worth getting, no doubt. Compared to Dinosaur Revolution, it leaves out quite a bit and jumbles up the story lines, often placing scenes out of context (where they made sense and followed a clear narrative in Dinosaur Revolution).The scenes not included are : The Cryolophosaurus, the Mosasaur, the Gigantoraptor and the Eoraptor. The one bonus is you get a brief scene at the beginning where an Acrocathosaurus is brought to life from a skeleton and wanders out of the museum into a modern day city. My recommendation is buy it if you cannot get dinosaur revolution on DVD or Blu-Ray, or if you simply are willing to spend whatever it takes even for a brief glimpse of Acrocanthosaurus. For those of you already owning Dinosaur Revolution, this reshuffled and edited version will not add to what you already have witnessed (Acro aside). Overall, I thought Dinosaur Revolution was a better production."
4,real good album,these songs are really good and have aged well.her voice is solid and she can handle different styles of music.with each new release of music from her she showcases another style.
4,Great hits,"Great hits.I love the song "" Color of the wind"" but it's not as good as I listened in a MV. I'd like that MV version but not found."
5,Don't hesitate!!,"The holidays would not be the same for us without this collection. Great liner notes and many Christmas pictures. Beach Boys Christmas tunes ...what more could you want?? Also newly available at Amazon.com, check out The Beach Boys:An American Band on DVD. Great interviews and rare live performances!! Don't miss the great Brian Wilson piano solo on Surf's Up - ""I heard the word, won-der-ful thing, a children's song...."""
5,"great show,","Loved this show and remember seeing it yrs ago on tv, caught a few replays on Comedy network recently so looked it up and finally found it on Amazon. Very funny show and just wish they would have made more or done a few more seasons. If you like silly humor you will enjoy this show."
1,Same Old Ellison,"Harlan Ellison proves once again that his introductions are far more momentous than his short stories! Slippage has destroyed my faith in Ellison as a writer of fiction once and for all. The stories are, by turns, smarmy, self-indulgent, unfathomable, and worst of all, boring. The introductions to the stories are just the opposite: enlightening, thought-provoking and entertaining. They share an obvious reality the stories sorely lack. Nowhere is this sad dichotomy more evident than in Ellison's account of his stormy separation from the New Twilight Zone TV series. To take a do-or-die stand over the insipid, predictable piece of fiction in question proves beyond a doubt that Ellison is simply no longer in touch."
5,love it,"i Like Psych it is my favorite tv show and it is extremly funny, lot of people should watch it is really good"
5,WHy are you not watching this show,"By far one of my favorite shows. What makes this show work is not smarts, but the laughs. If you one ounce of humor in you, you can not stop laughing when watching this show."
5,Psych Rocks: My fave episode this season (so far).,"""Psych"" is very entertaining and makes me laugh. It's my go-to show when I want to relax and vegetate. I recommend it to anyone who just wants to kick back, smile and have fun. Very enjoyable."
1,Don't buy it!,"I agree with John Bellis. Very strange and unintuitive interface. Maps not at all up to date. Customer support nonexistent (wait up to an hour and then asked if want to spend ... dollars for support). Delorme makes Microsoft seem bland when it comes to sucking more money out of users for upgrades. You might note that they are not continuing this particular software (Road Warrior) I wonder why?! Also, you can use their software with other GPS units but not their unit with other software. The people who are giving favorable reviews must work for Delorme."
1,Worst map software I have encountered.,"I agree 100% with first reviewer. I tried this software on two different notebook computers. It was full of bugs. One time it would work on a computer and the next time the data cd would try to install itself and hang up the entire computer. Some locations would show roads and some would not even show interstate-this at the same zoom level. The software also does not use standard GPS language like waypoints. The interface is not user friendy. I am a very experienced computer user, teacher and database designer. I would hate to try this software as a novice."
1,HATE CLASSICAL MUSIC,"I wish I had read more about this product before buying it. Classical music is not for everyone, and I detest it. If you are like me and detest classic then don't buy this. I just wasted twenty five dollars."
5,Works Perfectly!,This is the best thing I have seen since sliced bread! This product really really works! Makes your closet moisture free! The Damp Rid product is the best! If you have problems with moisture this product will take care of the problem and make your closet smell great.
2,greatly disappointed,"i had high hopes for this album after moderately liking his first stuff. i've tried listening to it 10 times or more and my overall sentiment that it sucks remains. Only about 2 or 3 of the songs are worth anything. the rest are just really really played out, tired reggaeton beats, and his voice oversinging the songs. its surprising because he has relatively good producers and guest artists appearing on the album, but the song structure and his lyrics and his rapping and his singing on this album can't pull it together. if i give it 2 stars its because its not COMPLETE crap... but i definitely would not recomment others to buy it. the few good songs on here don't make up for the rest of the crap on it."
5,Nice scanner and supporting software,This is a really nice scanner whether you are scanning pictures or documents. The supporting software that comes with the scanner is very good too. If you are doing pictures and you separate the pictures so there is a distinct border around the pictures you can scan multiple pictures at once... then save each one by a different name as a jpg file. You select the amount of compression. The copy button is nice on the side and comes in handy for making a quick color or B/W copy of something sending it directly to your printer. I have had this for 6 mo or so and I love it. I would definately buy this again.
2,"Hardware Good, Software Bad","Hardware wise, this is a good scanner. Especially like the fact that it gets it power thru the USB cable.As far as software, I really miss my old HP Scanjet (finally died after several years). With the HP, EVERYTHING that I wanted to do was within one piece of software. With this Canon Scanner, there are MANY pieces of software (CanoScan Toolbox, Easy Photo Print, Omni Page SE, Presto Page Manager, Photo Studio), and to do a simple scan requires at least one of them, and sometimes TWO!!! I still haven't figured out how to do everything that I want to do. Many times, I have to reboot my computer because one of the pieces of software locks up my system, or just eats up tons of memory."
2,NOT a quality product,"I should have trusted the other reviews, but I figured that people were just being too picky - it is only a $30 stand, after all. I was wrong. This stand is barely worth $5. It appears to be height-adjustable, but there is no way to lock it into the desired height (only the boom angle), meaning that the smallest bump will screw it up. Even if you let it rest at the lowest height, there is still a lot of give in all the other joints. I will be returning this stand.One other point: if you plan on using your stand with a Shure SM7b, or a microphone with a similar bracket-system, you need to buy a stand where the threads on the stand point either up (simple stand without boom arm) or down (overhead boom), but not straight at you, like this stand. Otherwise you will have to tilt the arm to an extreme and awkward angle just to get the mic pointed at your face. Hope this helps!"
3,language of astrology = language of genetics ?,"A.T. Mann is raising some very important questions and concepts in this book. His idea of reincarnation and a potential higher function of the DNA molecule as a repository of all history within us makes sense (though I remain neutral re reincarnation). His Life Time Astrology is worth a closer look, but in (my) practise I could not always relate some specific events to his time scale. In using a computer program to print his time scale incl. the accompanying constellations and comparing them to some natal charts I'm not convinced that his time scale is correct. I'm not saying that his time scale is incorrect either, but I could not find an overwhelming evidence for a link between a certain life event and the time scale. Possibly not all birth-times I used were correct but it left me hungry. His theory - how valid it may seem - needs further practical research."
3,very foamy,"Its pretty good flooring, but it can't take much abuse. I was doing some bench pressing with dumbbells that were only 50lbs. After only one drop from 10-12 inches off the ground theres 4 pretty nasty dents. I'd say in a month or so they'll be kinda torn up.I gave it a 3 out of 5 because if you don't plan on dropping weights on it then they'll probably last a while and serve their purpose."
3,Disappointed Workmanship,"Disney items are overpriced and most are made in China. This item was made in China and there must be no quality control. This item was ordered as a Christmas present in late September and when given to my granddaughter the zipper was broken - too late to complain and return. I had to take it to a tailor in order to have it fixed. Another added expense, but she likes it and that is what matters."
2,poor quality,"The outer zipper was defective upon receipt. Did not like the thin, flimsy, oversized piece of fabric that covers the wheels when used as a backpack... the fabric is too long and would drag on the floor when rolled. The overall feel of the fabric and plastic was poor.. not worth the money. Doesn't roll well either. Very unfortunate because it was really cute."
2,PLASTIC PENS ARE GARBAGE,ALL 4 PENS THAT GOES INTO LEGS BROKE WHEN I WAS PUT THEM ON THE FIRST TIME. THEY PLASTIC AND CHEAP. STRAIGHT GARBAGE!
5,Great camp stove,"Much better control of flame than any other stove I or my friends have owned. Can go from cooking on 30"" griddle to frying omlett in 8"" skillet with no trouble or worry of burning up omlett or skillet."
3,"Nice, but too small","It was difficult to find shirt studs without cuff links, so when I came across these sterling silver studs, I purchased them. They are very nice - a good weight and quite dressy - but too small for the button holes on my husband's tuxedo shirt. The studs popped right out the first time he used them."
5,Hanson totally rock!,"Even if you're not a big Hanson fan, this is an excellent rock CD. I loved the way it was straight from one of their Albertane concerts, live music is the best. You can tell by listening to the CD that Hanson aren't just one of those bands that lip-sync, or rely on studio magic when producing albums. For them, it's about the music, not about the fame, not about the money. They're passionate about what they do and in turn, produce great results. Go out and buy the CD!"
1,This CD could be a lot better!,"I have all of Hanson's CD's and this one stinks compared to the rest of them! It is just mostly just a lot of girls screaming and their old songs and a couple of new one's that you had already heard if you had been to one of their concerts.(Like I Have.)Like I said, they could have put a little more time into this CD."
4,Live is GREAT,This album is one of the BEST live albums in the history of live. This CD marks where Hanson's voices began changing. And there are some new songs and cover songs.
1,Big Dissapointment,"We were searching for software that would allow us to create our own recipe book. This one does, unfortunately, it is weak in its categorizing ability. For example, we created our book and added a recipe for pie. Then, when you want to view all pie recipies in your book, you are forced to view all pie recipies on the CD. You could create a chapter called ""pies"" - but this is not very flexible (desserts would make more sense).The screen layouts are unpolished and are not user friendly. Try finding Nutritional information (hint: click the list button).Also, the program requires the CD to be in the drive at all times. You should have the option to skip the videos and run the program without the CD."
4,Manual de grama'tica Book,"The product came in a lot faster than I thought. There were folds in the cover and some of the pages were bent, but it wasn't anything that they didn't say on the description. For the price, it was moderate, but by no means a bargain. I'm happy with the book, but I just wish it were cheaper!"
4,What a Day,Adam Pelko a military brat attending civilian high school in Hawaii. Adam finds it difficult to make friends moving so frequently. He meets Davi Mori and Martin Kahahawai and they become friends. They plan to go fishing the next day. The boys row out into Pearl Harbor and cast their lines. This simple trip turns out to be the most tragic day of Adams life as he watches the planes fly overhead and explosion of the USS Arizona. The ship his father is on.The rest of the book progresses as if he is in a dream...he is pushed from child to sailor in minutes and helping search the waters for live men. He can't believe what he is seeing. Adam lives the horror and tragedy. Adam left the house that morning on his bike and came home carrying a gun.Harry Mazer is powerful. A Boy at War: A Novel of Pearl Harbor is a page-turner.
3,the boy who fought the war,This book is about a boy named Adam. His father is a sailor in the war and does not like Adam having friends that have Japanese parents. Adam is new at his school and is only friend Davi has Japanese parents. One day they are fishing and Japanese planes start to bomb pearl harbor and they just stand there watching for a few minutes then a plane comes and shots at them.Alex gets hit but he lives his other friend Martin gets a stick cut threw him and Davi gets beatup.They all live thow except Adams father.
3,Boy at war,Average my son read as a part of his 6 th grade AR points. Lil violent bit nessasary to tell the story
4,The Immortal CARMEN!!,"Look at the selections offered in this CD and, of course, it has only Carmen remarkable designing these songs in her style. It is refreshing to listen and makes you wonder why you shouldn't have a collection of HER!!Every thing blends and just a bargain price for this beauty and I rank it high on my collection of CARMEN---right, after YOU CAN""T GO HOME AGAIN!!"
1,Incorrect Fit,"Bought this item readily after the amazon website confirmed its the right fit for my vehicle. When it arrived, I opened the package only to realize that it had a male connector. The one in my car (the faulty one) has a female connector. Please be mindful of this while ordering."
1,Rubbish Dont buy,It Works out the box for about 2 cycles of which each only last about 7 mins b4 it starts to die. Now shaking it for 3-4 mins and it barely holds the charge. The chinese knock of version i got for $1.99c works great. Been going 3 months now with that 1.Maybe i got a dud. Or maybe its really a new form of aerobics cause after all that shaking i think lost 12lbs.
4,"Really excellent, but deserves better mastering","Recent engineering efforts in the classic jazz field have demonstrated that even recordings from the late 1930's can be processed so that they sound both more pleasing and more accurate than the original 78rpm record. Unfortunately, this particular volume does not benefit from such treatment, though the sound quality is certainly acceptable given the age of the masters used (1939 & 40).This collection contains some of Basie's best songs and is therefore a necessity for classic jazz fans, as are the first and third volumes in this series. The band swings hard here, and there is a palpable energy that seems to have been toned down in his later recordings."
5,Makes you glad to be a keyboardist,"Wonderful performances and interviews with famous keyboardists of the last century were a great pleasure to watch... in fact, have watched the video many times and learn something new with each viewing. As an amateur pianist, I am amazed to find that the masters also have their quirks and problems but have managed to work them into a personal style that led to fame and critical praise. It makes me glad to be a VERY minor member in a group of such amazing artists. In this day and age of everyone who can sing along with their favorite pop song expecting to land a recording career minus the HUGE amount of training it takes to learn the technical aspects of music, it is great to watch these old masters who slaved over theory lessons, scales, and finger exercises. Their knowledge of the art of music is truly inspiring. I want to go right out and start taking some more lessons - and I'm an old lady HAHA. A must-have video for anyone who enjoys classical music."
4,Hardest Hitz,"Yo this album is good, of course the P song is the best 'cause I'm a No Limit Soldier 4 Life. Buy this, you won't be dissapointed. Hoody Hooo!"
3,Package is Great.. only...,"well, I won't take too much of your time.. the only good thing about this is the Package it comes in.. and the red vhs (which no one will ever see).. the 3 stars come for the big box ONLY.. the movies.. you might see once... and never ever again, and might not even finish.. because they are that bad.. and I'm a fan of ""bad movies"".. but these are so bad.. that it's not even fun to watch them...."
4,A classic of the romanic 19th century,"The Italian fight/death scene just wiped me out...It is kind of hard to put it with a Jane Austin movieor Charlotte Bronte, but that is the kind of British romance of manners that it seems to group with.The Importance of Being Earnestis a farce on this sort of melodrama in literature that dominated the 19th century.The acting Helena Bonham Carter as the foolish British girl who doesn't know love when it bites her is very good.The filming, costuming and directing is nearly flawless.I hadn't heard of this film and was very pleasantly surprised at getting such a gem."
5,"Sexy, wonderful and a joy to behold","What's so bad about naked men running around a swimming hole? Of course, one has to hide in the bushes because his mother and sister and have just arrived on the scene...Rejoice in this wonderful movie of love, Italy, ""digestive biscuits,"" men named Cecil, and ""poor Charlotte."""
1,Dismal DVD,Great film. Horrible DVD. The images are so fuzzy; you'll find yourself looking for a focus knob.
1,A Beautiful Movie Ruined on DVD,"This is the worst DVD I've ever seen. The tragedy is that A ROOM WITH A VIEW is one of the most beautifully photographed movies ever made. The scenes of Florence and rural England, not to mention the interiors and the close-ups, are magnificent. But some [person] at Cinecom or Image Entertainment got the idea of superimposing a pinkish sepia gauze over the entire movie. All the beauty is gone. One can only hope that a later, commemorative edition of this movie will start from scratch and do a better job."
4,"Love the movie, but the remastering....","This has always been a favorite movie of mine-- enchanting, visually stunning and superb acting. But I have to say, I think that the digital remastering takes some of that enchantment away. At least with the audio aspect.Actor's voices have lost the human richness-- esp the women's voices which sound higher pitched and slightly annoying. Even the music and sound effects sound a little ""off.""So, it was sadly less of an enjoyable, enchanting experience for me watching this version. That said, I still love this movie, so I'm giving it 4 stars (minus 1 for the bad remastering).But this is just my opinion, so feel free to take it or leave it.Cheers!"
4,"Lovely, Passionate and Haunting","Italy has never looked finer than in this classic period drama featuring the undervalued Helena Bonham Carter in a star-making performance. Tha tale is sweeping and grand, a power struggle for Carter's affections ensues, under the watchful eye of the ever-glowing Maggie Smith. Surely the finest of Merchant-Ivory's classic films, ""A Room With A View"" desreves a place in your DVD collection."

3,Useful for Tips on Technical Writing,"Useful for the intended purpose. As you might guess it is not a ""beach read""."
1,Useless paperweight,"Sadly, the enclosed power adapter did not fit the drive. Same problem with the replacement. MicroNet seems to have a quality control problem."
2,"Iolanthe. Hammond Stroud,Mills,Collins,Opera World.","This production leaves much to be desired, and was ill conceived. The singing is adequate, but the film's direction included far too much irrelevant 'business' which detracted from the singing, and the theatrical presentation. The ballet and the stage 'blocking' appeared to be under rehearsed. Also, the colour is weak. As W.S.Gilbert said (Mikado) -- 'Modified rapture'"
1,terribly done,"shipping was fast, however it was terribly done, the gold tone was not flat and with a lot of bubbles inside, so it make the pin looks very cheap"
1,frog backpack,"you can't put anything in the backpack because it is too small, therefore, i bought it for nothing."
1,jeremy renner for 10 minutes,"if you're looking for an early jeremy renner film do not bother with ""paper dragons""...he's gone in the first 10 minutes and what follows is just not worth it...great asian icons wasted on crappy material...and to make it even worse? the cinematography is beyond bad, hell it's sometimes out of focus...do not, i repeat, do not buy this film...i tried, really, i honestly tried to watch it from start to finish, but decided to do dishes instead...OUCH!"
2,"Very very thin cardstock ""photo frames""","So I guess this falls into the category of either expecting too much or you get what you pay for... These ""Photo Frames"" are only made of about the thinnest cardstock you can imagine. The slightest breeze of someone walking past sends them toppling, and I suspect that within a week, once the photo paper starts to curl a little, the whole frame will implode...So it's a relatively fun little art project for the young ones, it's relatively inexpensive, but do NOT kid yourself that you will be able to use these as any sort of a picture frame..."
3,"Heart warming, life changing, not scholarly","I personally got a lot out of this book. It seems to mirror a lot of what is going on in my life. However, the book as a whole feels very anecdotal. It cites very little, and gives few examples research wise or in testimonial form of real addictions. That being said, at least for me, the book gives good advice. While my educational background gives me an automatic skepticism of the book, when one is in a ditch, who cares?"
2,Rope Doesn't Stay in Clips,"The rope lighting I purchased came with cheap clips and not enough of them, so I purchased these for supplemental support. I used all of them to hold up one strand. They were easy to install and easy to push the rope lighting up into. They are the correct size for the rope light I have installed. However I do have one end of lighting that refuses to stay clipped and day by day the rope begins to dangle to the point where I have to go push it back into the clips."
3,Product Lights not all Working,The product was received in a timely fashion. Unfortunately about four feet of the rope lighting did not work. Fortunately I did not need the entire length so chose to keep the product for the use I intended.
1,Bogus,"I ordered this CD and expected it in a short period of time, per the ad. After three months, I was notified that Amazon could not locate the item, and my order was cancelled. That same day I saw the same item on Amazon, ""available for shipping in 1-2 business days"" at 5 to 6 times the price when I ordered it."
5,Great for a giftt!,"I gave this to a young friend (9 year old young lady) who is heading to Paris with her family in August. It is a lovely introduction to Paris for her. I think this will cue her into being alert for things she has ""seen"" in the book. I am certain this book will enrich her experience as she discovers the lovely ""city of ligjhts"" for herself!"
5,Fabulous product!,"We love this product and are now using it in place of olive oil. It has a much higher smoke point, so is perfect for frying. The first order took a while due to high demand, but our second order came within days. thanks so much!"
3,Bacteriostatic!,Not much to say. This is a solution to counter the growth of bacteria in your humidifier's water. It does what it is supposed to. Huzzah!
4,Quality product,"Have used this product in my older humidifier and it continues to provide the water protection needed, so that is why I continue to order."
4,Raw Texas Blues,"Bought this ""CD"" on cassette tape when it originally released.I'm happy to see it's now on CD. Nice original songwriting with coarse, butt kicking delivery. Fans of SRV would probably like this. Give it a listen."
1,Zero Stars,"I should have rented this confused, disjointed hodge-podge from Netflix, rather than having wasted the miniscule amount it cost me to purchase from Costco.Utter junk! Although ""trooper"" me had to stick it out to the very end, hoping for a simulacrum of improvement.Which never manifested."
2,Slow and Unsatisfying,Movie was slow and hard to watch. Not very satisfying. Would have made a better TV show than a full length movie.
1,Should have followed by instincts and stopped watching,"I usually don't write reviews for Amazon, but this movie was so bad I wanted to try to save others from my misery. 1/3 of the way through, I was really tempted to stop watching, but kept telling myself that it might get better. It never did. I have Amazon Prime so I'm not out any money, but I did waste my time."
1,Don't buy it.,"This movie was charming and sort of interesting at the beginning, boring in the middle, and disappointing at the end. I'm glad I watched it on Amazon Prime because I would have been upset had I paid for it. The acting is decent, but overall fairly dull (a shame since they had a good cast), and the only likable character is portrayed by Kirsten Dunst. I wanted to stop halfway through but was slightly curious as to how it might continue. Curiosity was my downfall, as I lost another 50 minutes of my life to this snorefest."
2,Unable to care about the characters,"While others see Gosling as having done a great job, my own response is that he did, if what he was going for was boring. His character should have been interesting. Instead I found it so boring that it was impossible for me to believe in Dunst's devotion to him. As a result I didn't care about any of the characters. I found the movie long, boring, and disjointed."
1,This was a horrible movie!,"It was all in subtitles, poor continuity in the beginning and hardly any martial art actions. It just kept dragging onand on. If you do watch this, try to be drunk. That is theonly way it will be enjoyable."
5,Wendy & Lisa,"wendy & lisa or girl brothers doesn't matter what name they go by.This is my favorite disc of theirs so far. Their new disc are good too, but this is still my fav."
1,"Muddled thinking, crass, inelegant style","Reviewed by a woman. I struggled through the first thirty pages, but could not get through the bad writing. He distorts the concept of manhood assuming it to be the most negative and degenerate form of masculinity, and then goes ahead to ""deconstruct"" it. Man-haters will love it, men searching for the meaning of manhood will waste their time with it."
5,I-45 are truly the Kings of Slip-Hop,I-45 is coming straight out of Houston with a new listening experience. It is like nothing you have heard before they are the self-proclaimed Kings of Slip-Hop. This CD is one of the very few that I can listen through from the first track to the last and if you like this CD then try as hard as you can to find their first release Regal Beagle. This guys really can rock the magic kiss and if you decide you don't like them then go to the doctor cause you got problems.
1,Love me some Rik Mayall,"but this was just too much, it was pure torture, bought it sight unseen AND on top of that was using it as an introduction for a friend of mine to see Rik's work, well needless to say it's doubtful they will ever watch anything Rik did or does in the future, this film is THAT bad!Even the chick from ABFAB can't save this stinker!"
1,Don't waste your money,"The diamonds were very black, so what else is there to say. I sent them back."
1,VERY poor quality,"Numerous flaws. Very dark, no sparkle. They are being returned today. Maybe other positive reviewers got a better batch. The ones we got are not worth $1 as you wouldn't want your loved one wearing these."
4,Diamond earrings,"Not a bad product, but a little smaller than I expected. The clarity and certainly the overall is worth it."
5,Earings,Gave them as a gift and she loved them... no problems with delivery at all was pretty fast. Overall was very happy!
4,Bop and subtelty combined.,"With his brilliant rhythm section, especially Jack DeJohnette's powerful drive, Chet Baker delivers a combination of honey-smooth vocal ballads with lyrical trumpet lines, and swingin bop tunes that capture the brilliance of Baker's improvisation."
4,Woof! It's Dogz 2 on the loose!,"I love Dogz 2. I think it is a great program. I love having a dog run all over my screen whilst I am working, I love playing with it, grooming it, petting it and feeding it. The graphics are great, and the sound effects realistic. However Dogz 2 can sometimes cause problems with your sound card. Before you load this program check to see that it won't clash with anything because if it does it can cause a messy problem where you might need to re-install your sound card, been there, done that, worn the T-shirt. However, despite this, I still love Dogz 2, it livens up your computer, and keeps you on your toes. So glitches apart go out and get this program, it's worth it and as an added bonus you don't have to follow this dogz around with a pooper-scooper!"
5,Fits American Doll Girl Perfectly,"The package arrived quickly. The shoes were as cute as the picture and they fit perfectly. The shoes seemed well-constructed, too."
2,Not as pictured,"I was rather dissapointed when I recieved these little shoes. The black Mary Janes did not have a buckle as shown, so they look really plain. The white sandals were not all white, but white and pink. The sandals are cute, but I did want all white, to go with outfits for the doll I that I have sewn. I did choose these shoes based on the picture, so although they are ""fine"" they are not what was expected."
1,Brace yourself for self important dribble,"The only thing I can imagine that would be worse than actually listening to Bill speak would be reading his speeches. This guy is an offensive, overbearing, radical fear monger. The ramblings of his last work (My life as a radical lawyer) still make me wince at the amount of time I wasted reading them. Bill isn't some idealistic, fantastic lawyer defending the rights of the disadvantaged. He's just some schmuck who happened to be at the right place at the right time.This book promises to offer erroneous advice, misguided musings, and tiresome rants. Buyers beware."
2,Oh gosh...,"As a native of Louisiana, if someone is going to sing about Louisiana, he or she should at least pronounce the words correctly... However, suprisingly, he has a great voice...I'll go for a 2."
5,Excellent,"Exactly what I needed, great product! I've noticed that the lids/covers have changed over the years but everything is great."
1,"Its made by All Trade, battery dies if you turn around!","Hate the poor battery life! Whenever I need it, it's drained! Even if fully charged a day or two ago! Also, it carries a Kawasaki logo (the reason a lot of people buy it) but its made by AllTrade which, to me, is a misrepresentation and sort of deceitful (unless you are into reading fine prints!). Overall it gets the work done but is not reliable when you need it, for above reason.Will not buy again!"
3,Not as good as his other works.,"Years ago I purchased ""The Pleasure Prescription"" on audio tape and listed to it over and over because it had some much good information and novel perspective. I am having some trouble plodding through this one."
1,Don't do as De La does.,"This was the most disappointing album I've heard in a long time. And don't think I was hoping they'd be remaking another 3 Feet High or De La Soul is Dead. I was hoping they'd grown. Stakes Is High gave promise of a change, and that change has come. Too bad it's a severe digression. There is no longer anything that sets De La Soul apart from the ubiquitous hip-hop garbage that rules the radio airwaves in teenagers rooms. With groups like Blackalicious, Jurrasic 5, and Kool Keith's many incarnations, why couldn't De La come up with something at least as original as these? The answer, I'm afraid, is that they are tired of being creative and ready to start making some money.Reading the sleeve of this album, I noticed they plan to ""remix and remaster"" 3 Feet High & Rising. If they ruin that monumental album with anything close to the throw-away work done on Art Official Intelligence, they will also ruin all credibility they've ever had."
5,SpitKicker Tour was a De La show you dont wanna miss,"I had the pleasure of being present for the best hip-hop tours this year. Spitkicker Tour witch featured De La Soul, Common , Pharoahe Monch, Reflection Eternal (Talib Kwali of Black Star and Hi-Tek) and Biz Markie as the DJ. De La Soul introduced four of there new songs at this show witch made me put my name on the list for the CD. The songs that I remembered were ""Foolin"" , ""Ooh"" and ""U don't wanna B.D.S."" and one more. De La has been around for a long time and still hold down the art of true hip-hop. The title ""hippy"" has hung over there head at the beginning of there career but now De La is well respected as pioneers of there style. The CD is a must have for all De La fans who collect there CD's like me.oNe"
2,Mozaic thud,"De La ain't having very much fun anymore, and it REALLY show on this one. Better than it's predecesor ""Stakes it High"", but absolute poopy when you put it up against their first three disks. True, their lyrics still blow away 97 percent of the other acts, but they're even weak in that department this time around. Most of this record smacks of 'a desperate attempt to get their cruddy music played on the radio.'They've only got five records out total. It's much too early for them to tread water.Here's hoping volume two and the rumored reunion with Prince Paul will set them back on course."
5,"""Ponders these things""","A novel that ponders some very deep questions -- One's relationship with God -- God's relationship with a community and the world. ""That the world was now coming of age and needed a new understanding of God.""This novel sneaks in great advice such as ""being fretful so often that joy seemed impossible"". Much more than ""a chick novel""."
5,Thoughtful and insightful,I love this author and all 3 of her books. She has clearly drawn characters and intelligent plot development. I am anxious for her next novel due in the Spring.
2,cold and boring,"Wow, the rave reviews were puzzling. I do respect that other readers have differing opinions and taste in books. I read about 2 novels a week and about all sorts of different subjects. Obviously there is no need to repeat what the story is about, but the bottom line is what an incredible bore the story turned out to be. I forced myself to finish it because I kept waiting for it to get better and it didn't. Not really anyway. The end was annoyingly predictable, also.Ms. Strout, I've no doubt you are a good writer. Just that this time this book wasn't for me."
5,"Heart wrenching, but beautiful...","It was hard to read for a while, because it tugs at your heart, big time! As it all comes together, you are there, in the story, cheering and crying!"
4,Good book,"Excellent book. Shows Pre-ww2 Poland for what it really was an imperiaist warmonger. Kievian -Rus lands stolen by Poland in the middle ages always created strife. Polish nobility forced Ukrainians to be serfs while Poles remained the Aristocrates. This is interesting because Hitler had these same plans for Poland. Poland instigated the Polish-Soviet war, which in fact most Poles hate to admit. He should have also metioned how Lenin appointed many Poles to his secret police the Cheka and these Poles such as Dzerzhinskii slaughtered millions of Russians."
3,Reasonably accurate-dual scale scale,"I bought this because I wanted a non-electronic scale that reads out in kg (despite living in the USA, I much prefer the International System of Weights and Measures). It was, as I recall, the only dual-scale analog scale available at the time. On the plus side, the scale does seem to be reasonably accurate, without having to frequently adjust it to zero. However, the numbers are fairly small, especially on the SI side (the whole reason I got this scale, after all), and are difficult to read if one doesn't have good or better eyesight."
3,So-So scale,If you are two feet tall this could be an excellent scale. When you are six feet tall its impossible to read your exact weight unless you have the eyesight of an eagle.
1,HealthOMeter review,"Even though the dial is big, it is still hard to read. Also the scale is designed for people with small feet, otherwise your feet end up on the dial. I wouldn't buy it."
2,had to return it,"recently had my semi annual physical. thisscale put me at 20+ pounds over my old scale(which the housekeeper dropped)and thescale from my dr's office. it was just thescale i had wanted, and it was a disappointment.returned!"
2,Not suitable for young readers,I bought this boook for my granddaughter and thought it would be interesting for a young adult. I was disappointed because the boook reads like a college textbook: too many facts. This maybe alright for readers wanted to get an indepth look at the life and adventures of Jane Goodall.
4,"Great guitar work and original songs, no language barrier","I've lived in Japan for 12 years and still there are few Japanese artists whose music I want to own and keep listening to, but there is no language barrier when it comes to enjoying Yamazaki's music. He's a terrific live performer, a natural folk-rocker, and his audiences really get into it. Some of my favorite tunes are not on this album, but this is good. I also recommend One Knight Stands, a four CD collection on Polydor."
4,Good product!,"The other plastic garages and service stations that we have purchased in the past were made so poorly, but this one has really stood the test of time with two kids under the age of five."
4,"Warm, tender thought provoking",Ms Griffin introduced a very touching and realistic story of love forgiveness and family. This was not a traditional Romance novel. The main characters were developed and the story indeed had a message. You were pulling for Kendall to get out of her way and trust herself with affairs of the heart. Very good read.
1,warning: capressos are crap!!!!,"I bought the Impressa F7 for around $1200 about four years ago. I've had error messages and jamming for 3, even after they ""repaired"" it. For the last six months, it'll freeze up once a day, sometimes after I make one espresso, sometimes before I can make any. Now it doesn't work at all. The metal puck part is jammed up high inside. Not sure if it's bad engineering or inferior materials or both. But for $1200, it should last more than four freaking years. You've been warned."
5,no AMC with Acme Cable Co either,"I just found out my cable company is 'in negotiations' with AMC, so no Breaking Bad for me tonight. I will have to buy a pass as well. Dang.My provider is Wavecrest, but we just call it Acme."
5,the best show going,"This season was amazing, i really cant wait for season 5 part 2 but then again this is the final season, which is a shame. This will always be a 5-star show, i still cant stop re-watching it. I recommend it for everyone."
3,Less episodes and dwinding down,"Not as exciting as the previous seasons. I understand that this is the last season, but it could have been written better. Plus- is there are still great actors!"
5,Wow,"Just when you think a series can't get any better, and then you watch season 5...Problem is I have watched every episode and now have to wait till summer to see the rest. Wish they would keep the series going, but I guess all good things must come to an end."
3,Breaking Bad Season 5,Not close to being as good as the first 4 seasons.It is like the writers were going for a PG-13 Rating.
5,Great Series,"Best show in a long time. Been a fan from day one.Almost missed out on this season, Dish Network dropped AMC , thanks Amazon for having it available!"
4,TicTicTic....,This episode was a bit slow as the tension between Walt and Skylar is continues with an increasing crescendo. Skylar demonstrates her ability to take extreme measures. What is Skylar really willing to do?
5,Breaking Bad season 5,Extremely captivating series with amazing twists and turns! Great writing with thorough research. Keeps you on the edge every week.
5,Absolute must watch show.,Great show you need to see the whole thing in order to understand how it has evolved. I had shoulder surgery so watched all 5 seasons straight while mending on the couch. I loved the show
5,What can I say?,It's Breaking Bad is just a great show no matter what season you're starting on and this season is no exception.
5,Another good season,Picks up right where season 4 ended. If you liked seasons 1-4 you have to see season 5. Can't wait for the final 8 episodes this summer.
5,will be sad when it's over!,Really enoy this program. All the characters are terrific - very entertaining!!! Thanks for making it available for those of us who have not ventured into the world of cable television!!!
4,"Great series, mediocre image quality.","Obviously if you liked the first 4 seasons, this is great. I just didn't like the image quality that streaming gave me. Maybe it was due to my bandwidth but the images were a little blurry, image stuttered occasionally and the colors were flat. It would be much more desirable for small bandwidth users if we could have the option of letting it download enough of a buffer to have better quality. This option is available for YouTube and other video streaming sites, why not this one?"
3,Seasons aren't usually cut in half.,"Releasing half a season as a marketing ploy to build up suspense or generate more hype, make more in advertising or whatever, is complete douchebag bullshit. Otherwise, the series has weakened as has the character development. We learn this humble high school chemistry teacher cum genius once gave away a position in what became a multi-billion dollar company because of some girlfriend, but then he becomes a hardened scrupleless businessman? His development is unhinged and frankly unbelievable. Every other character around him seems very manufactured. This series has easily become the greater disappointment of what could have been remarkable - think Soprano's, only more dismal in the ""who cares"" predictable finale. I'd like to see our main character busted and sent up for 40 years... not likely. The brother-in-law is going to become a silent partner. Duh. Or maybe? Once again - who frikken cares? The best characters have been killed off - good job!"
5,A Really Compelling Season.,"I really enjoyed Breaking Bad especially this season, although I've been a fan since the beginning. I understand this may be their last season. I hope I'm wrong. I appreciate Amazon.com for carrying this series online otherwise I would have been shut out all together thanks to my satellite co. If they have a season 6, you can count on me being there. Many thanks Amazon."
5,Albuquerque is on the map in this show!,"We have been faithful fans of this show since its very first episode. Not only is the acting amazing and the writing very skilled and clever, but it is fun to identify places in Albuquerque that we know or have been.That aside, the gritty qualities of Mr. White, the savvy yet innocent qualities Aaron Paul brings to Jesse, and the ensemble work of the rest of the cast is beyond compare with many shows on network TV. We are sincerely going to miss this show when the series concludes!"
3,Love the show,"Unfortunately, when i purchase this i assumed it was for the whole season. I was wrong!! its only for the first 8 episodes"
5,It'll be a hard habit to 'Break',"This is by far,one if the best shows on television. From the stellar writing to the legendary performances...the series finale will be bittersweet ."
4,"Good, but too short","This is the best series ever. This free video is too short though, I wish it would be longer! Anyway it's worth watching."
3,breaking bad,"sometimes the stream stutters ,rewind functions not as good as netfixs and picture not as good as netflix stream. Season 5 not as good as prevous seasons as far as content . prehaps the show has ""jumped the shark""."
2,Gliding,"Not one of Breking Bad's better episodes. Slow moving . Nevertheless BB still the Best series , bar none. Have followed since day one.Please, please don't cancel."
3,Show was good but Amazon Instant Video sucks!,"I like Breaking Bad. It's a very good show, but Amazon Instant Video sucks! I got to watch maybe half the episode, and then it froze. But Amazon charged me for the whole video. Dishonest!!!"
5,Brilliant,"Season 5 was a total shocker. Seeing Walt's transformation completed was fascinating, as was the shift wherein Jesse becomes, in effect, the moral center of them all. Hank's discovery in the finale and the manner of it was classic. Can't wait for season six."
5,Amazon On Demand,"We had many friends who loved the series Breaking Bad. We heard of it, but never watched it. Netflix had the first few seasons and we went through those quickly. Season 5 was not on Netflix and DirecTV only had non-HD in their On Demand. Our Sony Blu Ray player has the Amazon videos capability. We have cable Internet with speeds around 35 Meg. But the Sony connects wirelessly to my wireless-N router. So the speeds are around 10 to 15 Meg.The picture quality was excellent, as was the audio.Bonus! If you are an Amazon Prime customer, there are quite a few free video videos you can watch. I very much recommend Breaking Bad, but equally recommend Amazon's on demand video. This is especially true if you don't get AMC from your subscriber."
5,Dynamite 5th season so far,"I am a victim of corporate problems due to a squabble by Dish network and AMC and neither side will budge, and it happened at the beginning of the 5th season for Breaking Bad. I've been following every episode since the beginning on Amazon.com and I have to say, every episode this season has me ending up screaming for the next. This is by far the most compelling and riveting season ever. I'm sure many Dish subscribers have followed suit. You can expect me back here if the same BS happens at the beginning of Mad Men."
3,Breaking Bad getting weak,"Season 5 a bit ""sketchy"", ""say my name"" the best/worst example.SPOILER ALERT...who believes Walt would have been able to pull of the events in the final scene.The ""fly"" episode is the next worst.Fingers crossed for season 6."
3,let down,"wish they would have kept it going another season. forced to end story early made for disappointing ending! only wanted 1st episode, clicked episode 1 for $1.99 and got charged $13.99 for whole season so wtf I watched it....wtg amazon.. way to make money off us poor saps...CLASS ACT...."
4,Season 5 Episode 1,This series continues to be one of the best. I look forward to catching up for this season and the return of the show
5,Breaking Bad Searon 5,"Best program on TV today. The acting and plotline of this series is exceptional. Each season gets more and more exciting. Too bad this is it for this show. I would highly recommend not only this season, but also go back to the beginning and watch them all. They are fascinating and great stories. This show has it all, excitement, humour, very serious issues, ego, alter ego, etc.....!"
5,BREAKING BAD IS,One of the best and most exciting television programs EVER! You will be on the edge of your seat from beginning to end!
5,Great tv show!,awesome show! i recommend it and we can't wait for the season to start again soon! Hooked on this show
3,breakling bad,"This show should have stopped a few seasons ago, the begining three were the best i believe then it just got repeditive, when you drag series out like this its bound to happen it lost its grip with me."
3,disapointing ending,"one of the 10 best shows of all-time, however, it was incompletely resolved. it was extremely hard to compete with season 4.viewers were set-up for a letdown"
4,Good gets even Better,"In the coninuing series, Breaking Bad keeps viewers glued to their seats even after the first four seasons.If you thought it couldn't get get even more convoluted or suspensefull, guess again!!I hope they keep it going for season six...."
5,WOW,Great show! Non-stop anxiety while watching and can't wait for next set to be released next year...but sad it will be the final episodes :'o(
4,"If you like TV at all, Breaking Bad is the very BEST... Ever","First, I only gave the Recap 4 stars, because it was not a full episode. I watched the Breaking Bad Recap and, because I have watched all of the episodes of Breaking Bad, I feel it was a pretty good slice of what went on during what is being called by the creators of Breaking Bad, the first half of Season 5. I cannot say enough about Breaking Bad. Unless scrambled and/or misrepresented in some nefarious fashion, any Breaking Bad clippage is good Breaking Bad clippage. You owe it to yourself to watch the entire series. There has never, ever been anything like it. No other show which has ever been produced comes into the same league with Breaking Bad... PERIOD."
5,Best show on TV!,"The saga continues with Season 5. Great show, great story, and just plain great entertainment! Go buy it now, you won't regret it!"
5,work-related video review,"keep in mind i do not pay attention to these free videos, as i only use them for work purposes. it played flawlessly, and was useful for the troubleshooting i needed it for."
1,Very bad season,"This is a very bad season, it seems more like a very bad soap opera. Very little action.They need to step it up and get more action going."
1,Terrible,This show is so dark! My husband enjoyed it but I could not stand it! He only watched it when I was sleeping.
3,so so season 5,"Season 1-4 blows you away, but 5- you just barely hold on. As always, great action scenes, but this time it was a little less realistic. Regardless, I am a fan, Awaiting season 6."
5,Breaking Bad Bonanza!!!,Looking to be a very Memerable season. Might bring a whole new meaning to BREAKING BAD! I hope it ends up well for the team!
5,The Best Season Yet,"Where will it go from here? That's the main question. I am of the belief that it cannot end well. Playing catchup with the series Breaking Bad I was able to watch seasons 1-4 via netflix for free. However since season 5 has just aired my option was to download from Amazon.com. The quality was very good and the price reasonable. I will go this route for future series catchup as well as using my Amazon Prime account for other ""included/free"" shows."
3,I expected better,"I saved this book for a vacation read and put it down numerous times. I finally finished reading it because I didn't have much else to read. It wasn't a bad story. Sensuality level was on the mark, but... it just wasn't a great story. However, I am in the minority and you should try this book. I usually love the 'family' novels, especially when you get to revisit characters. But this time it just felt too forced. I enjoyed 'The Winston Brothers' much more although by necessity the stories were short."
3,Rambling Romp,"This is a rambling mess of a story but you like the characters so much you almost don't care. There are plenty of moments that are solid gold. ""Joe"" is a treat! If possible, read Winston Brothers first and then this one. But brothers or no brothers, Zane and Tamara's story is a lot of fun. Although, I have to wonder at the use of ""small, pretty blonde"". Surely that's a tired cliche nowadays."
2,Rather Boring,"Burach's ""The Wierd Set"" is a classic -- Celtic Folk Bluegrass, great songs, fiery fiddle playing. It's one of the best discs in my entire collection. When ""Born Tired"" came out, it didn't quite match their first release, but it's still a very good CD and well worth owning.Sorry to say, this particular release did nothing for me. I actually thought that the band must have undergone a huge lineup change, the music was so different and uninspiring. Unfortunately this is the same lineup from ""Born Tired"", so I can't explain why I found this CD so lacking.One thing I can say is pick up ""The Wierd Set"". That disc smokes. Then if you like it you can pick up ""Born Tired"" and only then would I pick this one up. You might like it better than me, but even so I'm certain their first two discs are superior to this."
2,A HARLEQUIN-ESQUE STANDARD WESTERN,"""westward,ho,the women"" is a 1950's western starring robert taylor about a wagon train taking selected women west to be brides for the frontier men. In a nutshell that is what this book is.A little variation: our heroines Laura and Tucker are orphans and Laura is blind; The scoutmaster (like Robt Taylor) is a hunk, his scout is a halfbreed, the bad guys want the women..it was a cute western movie in the 50's but very predictable book. The other thing it lacked is depth. It made a big deal of Lucas possession of a tintype which resembled Tucker but never tied it in at all, and though all of the characters were interesting, we never got to really know them well. Too bad."
5,Best Novel of 2002,"In sharp contrast to all the other over-hyped novels of this year that turn out to be undreadable and instantly forgettable, The Year of Ice should be getting all the praises. This is truly one of the best works of fiction I have ever read. The author gets everything right; each and every page is wise, funny and heartbreaking. I read this book in less than 24 hours, have just finished it, and feel like I have been immeasurably enriched by the experience. The characters are as real as you and I, and the author displays a talent for telling a story that few writers possess. I wish happiness for all of the characters in the book, and much success for Mr. Malloy. I know this is a cliche, but do yourself a favor and read this tender and touching novel as soon as you can."
3,Compelling debut,"I just spent an entire afternoon reading a book I really didn't expect to like. Malloy's characters are well-developed, complex human beings. Even Kevin's disappointing father, a selfish narcissus, has his moments of redemption. Kevin is a refreshing change of hero from the run-of-the-mill coming out stories. He's not an over-achieving star athlete nor is he a willowy artistic loner. He's kind of a smart alek and fortunately Malloy has the chops to pull it off. It is not hard to imagine his words actually coming out of the mouth of a bright but conflicted young man. Even the minor characters -- his best friend's mom for instance--are fleshed out nicely. I highly recommend this very engaging novel and look forward to more from this talented author."
3,The Afterlife without God?,"After seeing this movie (which I enjoyed more for the special effects than for the content), I kept hearing that the book was better. So I bought it and read it...and was ultimately disappointed. Maybe I didn't find this book as compelling as others did because I have always believed in an Afterlife. The breadth of Mr. Matheson's research was impressive, but I did not find that the finished product had anything new to say. I was particularly bothered by the lack of God in this book. Sure, the Almighty was mentioned toward the end of the book, but I've always felt that God would play more of a role in Heaven. True, this is fiction, not theology, but..."
5,"The most believable, appealing vision of life after death!","I love this book! It often feels more like non-fiction than fiction due to the research done by Richard Matheson. It offers hope and food for thought about what happens to us after we leave this world. Even if you don't believe I'd be very surprised if you didn't think about the possibilities after reading this book.More than life after death, it's a love story. The love transcends death but doesn't prevent tragedy and despair. All-in-all, I find it a more ""real life"" depiction of love than the sugar-coated, all-is-perfect image so often promoted.Just a word of warning - if you've seen the movie, be prepared for something much better. If you haven't seen the movie, please don't. There is no way to successfully capture the tone of the book without losing much of the impact."
4,Definintely gives a new perspective on death.,"About a year before I read this book, I went through the grieving process for the first time with the death of my grandmohter. This book really helped me understand what that all means, ""to die."" I also read ""Talking to heaven"" by James Van Praagh, and it's like the 2 authors were sitting together when they wrote their books! Even if life after death is not so, these 2 books at least make grieving a little easier."
3,"This was an exciting and interesting journey to the ""beyond""","I really enjoyed this book, it was fresh, innovative and open minded.The imagery was vivid, the storyline riveting and the message was clear - Live a good life NOW if you want a good AFTERLIFE.This is a good read for anyone; no matter what your spiritual preference.I could not put it down!"
3,New Age view of the afterlife,"A collage of Eastern and Western religious ideas, with a bit of the Occult and Dante thrown in. The story itself took backstage to the ""lectures"" on how life works. Different than the movie in several regards. The book's main point was ""The mind is all."" I found many of the ideas intriguing, while others too simplicitic, and a few just plain bizarre."
4,If You've Seen The Movie,"If you enjoyed the movie then you will want to read the book. The book is much different than the movie and both are a worthy experience. Complex, detailed, and down right frightening it really gets the wheels turning as to what happens after death."
3,Uneven In Places But Generally Well-written,"I was expecting more from this book, based on the other reviews I'd read here. I agree with the reader from Denver that it's too heavy into ""New Age"" jargon, and that C.S. Lewis' ""The Great Divorce"" is a weightier, more intriguing picture of heaven and hell. I enjoyed two other of Matheson's books, ""I Am Legend,"" and ""Bid Time Return."" As in those, the first-person narrator undergoes tragic circumstances while confronting the fantastic. Parts of ""What Dreams May Come"" were truly moving, particularly the lead character's descriptions of how he loved his wife. Unfortunately, the book's ending is rather abrupt, bringing in a heretofore-unseen New Age element (which I won't spoil here) that kind of comes out of left field. It doesn't ruin the book, but it left me feeling that what I read was incomplete. This book is well-written, has some great descriptive passages, but ultimately leaves areas unexplored."
3,"It's okay and interesting, but not fabulous","So, this book was reasonably entertaining, interesting and thought provoking. However, I felt at times that there was too much dragging on in one area and not enough emphasis and pages spent on the really interesting things. It is always fun to get another perspective on the afterlife and all in all, I am glad that I read this book, but would not necessarily rush out to recommend it to others."
5,Learn from veteran homeschoolers,"Another great book is ""Things We Wish We'd Known"" compiled by Bill and Diana Waring. A collection of essays by 50 veteran homeschoolers, this book truly is a treasure of words from the trenches. The homeschooling veterans in this book were some of the first pioneers of the modern homeschooling movement. They blazed the way for homeschooling to now be legal in all 50 states. They know what they are talking about when they speak of family, learning, balance, education and much more. Read this book and take their advice. It's valuable."
2,cordless phone,I can answer the ring and can hear them OK. They can hear a slight sound but cannot understand my words.
3,Nice pictures and inspiration...,"This book was a nice picture book of country rooms and homes. I did enjoy looking through. However, I thought some of the rooms were rather ""outdated"" in the country look, and some like ""ethnic"" were...well, bizarre!I did like the Shaker and more modern designs, and thing it's a fine book to flip through."
4,I've always enjoyed this movie,"I've always enjoyed this movie. I probably shouldn't have been watching it as a child, but I did and still enjoy it some 15yrs later. I'm really glad I finally found it, been looking for it a long time now. The action is cool, the storyline is fun. It's so typical of the nudity and violence of the 80s. The storyline is cool though: innocent chick gets sent to jail for a supposed bank robbery and all hell breaks lose! She fighting crazy guards and fellow inmates. It's missing the 80s sex scene, but other than that, it has all the elements. Worth getting if you're an 80s movie fan!"
5,"The black truffle: Its history, uses, and cultivation","I'm a chinese Master student,i'm interested in truffle,so i have been doing some work on taxonomy and systemy of the Genus of Tuber in south-west of China,I'm looking forword to having chance to read this book,unfortunately,I couldn't get it ,I'm very appreciated if you can tell me how to buy this book? Thanks in advance!"
2,Well written but not interesting,I couldn't get into this book. Not the author's fault. Just not interesting to me. That doesn't mean that you won't like it.
3,Not quite tall enough,"These are a great idea in theory. They are sturdy and stay sealed and stack nicely. They are just not quite tall enough to stack 4 pies, unless your pies are completely flat on top."
5,A great take on the funny way we use the English Language,"If you like English & find yourself trying to help someone understand the English language (particularly American English), you will love the humor of ""Sleeping Dogs Don't Lay"".You will find yourself laughing out loud & probably looking on Amazon for more of his hysterical musings about the English language."
3,"Great look, needs adjustment","The glasses look great and work fine except, the diopter needs to be adjusted. It is fine for reading, but when doing close up work I have to either lean my head all the way back or lift the safety glass so I can you the diopter. So either a bigger one or raise it a bit. Maybe an adjustable nose piece so it can be raised or lowered for different face structures."
5,Greatest workout for a fit mom,"I started doing this workout with my mom when I was about 12. When I was 20 I coached cheerleading and had my varsity cheerleaders do it. Now, 30 and after 2 kids, this is still a great workout. The 7 minute timeframe works great for a busy mom. I do this every morning and it helps energize me for the day. My 4 year old likes to do the workouts with me and my 1 1/2 year old sometimes climbs on me but it's worth every minute.Get this, stick to it, and you will be amazed with the results."
5,LESHA'S OPINION,"i have probably ordered every exercise video there is, but the stomache formula is by far the best video there is. just like he promises if you do the exercise for 7 minutes for 7 days for 7 weeks you will have a flat stomache, period."
3,Good reference book,"A lot of good information, but it tends a little too much to the strict, rigid, formulaic methods of treatment. As much as I admire Petter, these treatment instructions push the loose, what works is true and everyone's approach is different concept I have for Reiki."
2,Disappointing,"I would have liked to write a favorable review of this book because I enjoy kayaking and being out in nature. Unfortunately it fails to convey the sense of high adventure, wonder, and splendor that are a part of every kayak outing in such remote and pristine locations. Instead, it laments the loss of ancient ways and cultures, and scolds modern man for his intrusions.I'm all in favor of no-impact camping and preserving pristine shorelines. As I started each chapter I hoped this would be where the book got interesting! But alas it disappointed."
2,Not a beginner's spectroscopy book,"If you're a beginner to spectroscopy, don't purchase this book. The author makes many assumptions about the knowledge of the reader while going from idea to idea. Many equations are not derived. Not only are they not derived, but the author makes no effort to explain where they came from or to provide anything that resembles context. This caused me to constantly lose my place, which caused a few pages to take hours to read and still not understand. If you're a beginner, do not buy this book. In fact, if you're anyone, don't buy this book. I keep trying to think of a suitable audience for this awful work, but I can't come up with any."
3,"FUNNY, BUT SOMETIMES IRRITATING AS WELL","It's the future and Mr. Gant is a strong force to be reckoned with in the business industry and there's an eco-terrorist group intent on bringing him down. There's also an artificial intelligence trying to take over and a mutated shark on the loose in the city`s sewers. All this is wrapped up in a large ball of satire and craziness. Overall, I liked this one. Unfortunately, there are instances where the author is trying too hard to be clever and that's what puts a kink in my enjoyment of the story because a lot seems forced or just downright irritating. But hey, all-in-all it's a pretty fun read."
2,"Well, it's ok, I guess.....","This tape is ok I suppose, it does leave a bit to be desired. The instructor only shows you how to do the moves, she doesn't spend any time at all doing them. You have to stop the video if you want to spend any time at all practicing the moves and stretches. But, if you don't mind having to stop the video after each demonstration, it is a good workout. The moves are very easy, basic and good for beginners. I don't think this tape is worth twenty dollars, but then again, the only other options are, in my opinion, outrageously priced."
4,"Good book, missing pages","I'm a novice in the world of macrobiotic cooking and purchased this book in order to educate myself. It supplies just the information I need. The edition I purchased is the 2002, Ninth Revised Edition and, whether it's a one time aberration affecting just the book I received or a larger problem caused when the printer was binding the books, Chapter 6 (pages 115 -130) was missing altogether. I would recommend this book highly, but you might want to physically examine one before buying it."
4,Very Helpful,"This was a wonderfully helpful book and was so much better than the one I received with the program. I was amazed at how much this program can really do and it made me love the program. I read through it once briefly to see what it said about the programs, and use it often as a reference guide."
1,self obsession,More navel-gazing which impresses the effete cocktail party crowd. She should be posing in a terminal Gap Ad. This book has no narrative pulse.
5,Hauntingly Beautiful,"This was one of the best books I read in 1999. The writing is hauntingly beautiful. The narrator(Sagesse) tells the story of the fracturing of her life and family- And the fracturing and restructuring of the family in the past. But the story is not just this simple. Messud explores nationality, the ideas of belonging-and not belonging simultaneously. This is always the outsider's view of the culture. Sagesse's family is not truly at home either in Algeria or France- anymore than Sagesse is later at home in The U.S. Besides being beautifully written, the book forces the reader to think and re-examine ideas. I found my mind did not leave this book even after I put it down."
5,Cellmass Creatine,"THE BEST CREATINE OUT!!! Ive only been through about half of this tub, maybe a LITTLE more, and it made my muscles in my arms and chest hard. Note I do go to the gym every other day so if you lift weights, this is great to take!!! The best creatine out!"
4,Works but tastes terrible,"I found this product to help reduce recovery times by reducing aches and pains that often set in after strenuous workouts (especially the next day). I have a couple of problems however. It doesn't dissolve great (I use a handheld stirrer that mixes whey/flax etc. in seconds but this stuff won't fully dissolve in water even after 30 secs of mixing); it's certainly more easily dissolved than 'regular' creatine however. The other problem is far worse: the Artic Berry Blast tastes very bad -- extremely sweet and tangy and just unpleasant. I will try another flavor next time because this flavor has led to me consuming the product only on workout days and skipping rest days (the instructions say to take it every day then cycle after a number of weeks). Perhaps a flavorless variety would be a good idea so it can be added to a shake (although the instructions recommend taking it on an empty stomach).Bottom line: works very well, dissolves 'ok', tastes terrible. Four stars."
2,Scientifically proven to NOT WORK,"Yes, the taste/texture is good, and it will help with recovery, but if you're looking to gain mass, use a different creatine powder. Beyond the hordes of those who have used Cellmass and swear they gained zero mass, studies have shown that it is an ineffective creatine and does very little for you beyond recovery. After 2 months, I switched to a different creatine and saw mass gain results instantly. If all you care about is taste, then by all means buy it."
5,A worthy sequel,"I enjoyed this addition to the Bartimaeus canon - they all read oddly but interestingly -- I particularly enjoy the demon Bartimaeus's commentary, full of humor and footnotes.A fun romp though London in the past/future when magicians are the ruling class."
3,"Oh well, had high hopes for this...","Book 1: Boy magician goes into training. Britain is ruled by an elite of wealth-&-power obssessed repugnant toads.Book 2: Boy magician joins the ruling elite, turning into a wealth-&-power obssessed repugnant toad.Book 3: Boy magician tries to recapture his humanity; kills off many chief repugnant toads. The junior toads step into their shoes, allowing some commoner input.Yawn.And: The jinni Bartimaeus is spunky and funny and has some cool stuff to say about the hidden underbelly of history."
4,Ptolemy's Gate,"Ptoleme's Gate , by Jonathan Stroud, had a lot of feeling, but was lacking something. I felt cheated when Nathaiel died just like that in end. Stroud was trying to make Nat seem like Ptolemy, but he was to selfish for that. I think that if stroud would waste his time writing about Skimpkin, then he should have written a chapter about Ms.Luttens before she saw Nat. All in all, it was a preety good book. Lots of suspense action and feeling. I stand by my 4 stars."
5,A Must Have For Any Rads Fan,"This album flows like Sgt. Peppers .. Every Song is great, I just wish they performed these songs live a lot more these days"
4,Rads' best,"Chock full of down home Nawlins gumbo and soul, this CD is far and away the best of the Rads' studio albums. ""Like Dreamers Do"" is a personal fave. See 'em live!"
3,Lost but not forgotten,Lost this in a move a long time ago. Finally decided to reorder. Can't wiat for the mail. Fist Radiators I heard.
1,I have this one,"I have this one it's total junk, dont waste your money, buy a dictionary or take a college class or something but this is one to not buy. I used it for school and it messed me up, I learned nothing from using it."
5,OEM,I had a little trouble with the application chart but these ARE the correct ones for both left and right sides on a 2000 Tundra v8 with 2WD. They come with new gaskets so no need to buy those separate. They look exactly like the old ones and I got good service with the originals so I'm confident I will get good service out of these. The Tundra blogs have a lot of chatter about troubles with other brands so I wanted to stick with the OEM.
4,The Mechanic,"Good movie, but somewhat predictable. I enjoyed the action scenes. I doubt there will be any sequels. I would recommend this movie to a friend but keep expectations contained."
3,"I would have enjoyed this more, but Charles Bronson ruined it for me!","As a big Charles Bronson fan, I've seen his 'The Mechanic' many times now. Though not as 'technically proficient' as Statham's character, Bronson's character seems more believeable to me, and Jan Micheal Vincent a more acceptable student of the dark art of assassination, er, 'mechanix'... I accepted Stathams character ok, but to take that unmotivated, obnoxious, lazy and subversive son of the victim and turn him into a sucessful 'mechanic' seems counterproductive and farfetched. How do we know he even had that 'aptitude'? We don't! It reeks of connivery in script writing, forcing a part that doesn't fit into the script to 'make it work'... but it doesn't for me. I may watch it again, for Statham's sake, but not as often as the original!"
5,Movie review,I saw the original movie The Mechanic starring Charles Bronson which was good. I thought this updated version starring Jason Statham was much better. They changed the movie a little from the orignal to the better. The action was really good. Jason was excellent in the movie. I really enjoyed the ending surprise. This movie is very good and if you like Jason Statham you should enjoy this one.
3,COOL & OK KICK ASS ACTION POP CORN FLICK!!!,"Statham knows the drill, and he puts in a typically cool, tough guy performance. Ben Foster puts in his typical skeezy punk performance. There aren't a lot of surprises, but it's fun to watch everyone go through the paces in this somewhat paint by numbers hitman movie. The fights are good, without too much reliance on quick-cutting, and none of the irritating extreme close-ups that are so in vogue right now. It's occasionally brutal, frequently grim, and likely forgettable.P.SI am 80schild/old school & Only thing makes me laugh & B.S to me these days in movies..They CUT out cigarette smoking in movies,like pass few movies i saw & Crank UP the Alcohol & Drugs instead, like those things don't kill you But Cigarette dose!lol, WTF!"
4,"Statham's Best, Although it's a Remake!","I am always critical of would-be tough guy Jason Statham with his over the top Transporter films, but the Mechanic is clearly his best, most complete film!First, I hate remakes, but since I did not know it was one at first, I can live with it. I do hate the fact that the globalist keep trying to get us used to seeing and hearing British people for their return to ruling the US! This film was not over the top and the stunts and killing was more realisitc than his other films. To me, this is what helps me accept Statham more than his Transporter films.Although they never explain why a British guy keeps traveling all over the US, I still like this one. I still feel that there are way too many British people in US TV, film and horribly - the NEWS!!!"
4,Firepower,"Morally ambiguous and violent, The Mechanic has a lot of really effective action set pieces. Statham is consistently somber as the lead character. His assassin is methodical, economical and deadly. Some of the character's motivations fail to materialize, leaving some plot elements not fully realized, but for an actioner, this one has plenty of firepower, crashes, explosions and bone crunching punches to satisfy.The Blu-ray presentation looked crisp and sounded great."
2,Implausible,"By ""implausible"" I don't mean the over-the-top action that has become part of these types of movies. What actually made the original work was Jan Michael Vincent's cool and that you could see Bronson, in his usual flat style, wanting to mentor him. I thought Statham's character was the equal to Bronson's, updated for our time, but given how he begins the film, there's no way he would take a guy like Ben Foster's character on. Once that happened, and Sutherland left, all the ""class"" went out of the movie and it became the usual shoot 'em up. Since this is a remake of a good movie, I think the comparison is fair and again, the flaw is in the Foster character. I also, like some reviewers here, would have liked to see some training without the jump to the student taking out a room of guys shooting left-handed, scaling buildings, etc. So. Lose yourself in the action but there is no story and Statham is ill-used, Foster mis-cast."
5,A very good action film with psychological undertones,"Jason Statham, who is generally good in his action films, is very good playing a professional hit man who is bothered that he had to kill a man he liked. He decides to make it up to this man by training the man's son to be a professional killer. Of course, he should not have done so because the boy's father had told Statham that the boy was disturbed and unable to act properly and because the boy, who doesn't know who killed his father, is looking for the murderer to kill him. The action in the film is riveting."
4,smaller than I thought,"My kids, 6, 4 & 2 enjoy playing with this. It's smaller than I thought, and really geared toward the younger 2 children. But, all 3 enjoy playing with it. What's nice about it's size is, it can be placed on a shelf & there aren't a lot of part to lose or break off."
2,The beginning of the end,"As much as I love Loverboy, ""Wildside"" is a uneven mess that was disliked by the band so much they didn't even tour behind it when it was released in 1987. I can still remember buying this the first day it was out and forcing my then-boyfriend to play the cassette in his car stereo ... and apologizing afterwards. ""Notorious,"" co-written with Jon Bon Jovi and Richie Sambora, and ""Break It To Me Gently"" are okay. ""Love Will Rise Again"" is easily the album's best song, but the rest ranges from barely mediocre to just plain awful. I'm actually surprised that it's still in print. Download the songs I mentioned and leave this alone, it's not worth it."
2,Banjo book,"It's not what I had hoped for. Live and learn, I guess. I was looking for something a little more interactive."
2,Not the best way to learn...,"This book is not very well written. I am a guitar player and a beginner banjo player. I can play most of the roll patterns and still could not find anything of value out of this book.An absolute beginner would be completely lost and an intermediate player might feel a little ripped off...lolI do not recommend this book for any level banjo player..Thanks,"
1,Worthless,"Those who gave this book a glowing review must be relatives of the author. This is one of the worst teach yourself banjo books I have ever purchased. This book can't hold a candle to Mel Bay's You can Teach Yourself Banjo. If you really want to learn to play the banjo, I would advise you to buy the Mel Bay book."
2,Maybe I'm more ignorant than the target reader,"I learned more by self-instruction than from this book, which promises to provide all the information needed for a complete beginner to the instrument. Corny and unintentionally humorous, the book makes many references to terms and techniques before or without explaining them. The book's contrast to any other similar book is only its folksy, conversational tone and self-deprecating asides from the author.I would not recommend to others, there are other beginner's books that are more useful."
5,"Finally, I can hear the Melody!","Fantastic Book! I've tried many others, but this is the only one that provided the easy building process for songs that allows a Banjo player to not get lost in all the fancy stuff and still hear the melody as you progress to adding more and more fluff."
1,"Bad. Really, really bad.","It's too complicated and too time consuming to use. I read the other reviews about only being able to translate one word at the time...I'm impressed. I can't even get that far. And on top of all of that, they were supposed to send me a rebate...but it's been 4 months since I sent in my paperwork. Now I can't even get their stupid little rocket icon from showing up twice on my opening page and interfering with another language program (that actually works!). Save your money!"
1,Terrible,"The worst piece of software I have ever used. Totally misleading. Does not come close to working as advertised. I don't believe this program is intended to work. It looks like a come on to purchase ""advanced"" versions and make you spend more money. Don't even consider this program."
5,A Must have,"I love, love, love this collection. I have it on constant replay in my iTouch. It's a must have."
3,amethyst earrings,"i like these earrings just fine. i have the matching necklace as well. the stone is small so color is difficult to see, but a nice pair of earrings just the same."
3,"Good book, but.....","I always enjoy Lee Smith's novels and The Last Girls was no exception. Finished it in less than 24 hours. However I kept getting the feeling that the book was written in a hurry, or at least edited in a hurry. There was at least one mispelling that I noticed, inconsistant time references, and (as one other reviewer pointed out) several minor characters had the exact same traits or backgrounds. Though I enjoyed the story, I kept getting caught up in these details and had a hard time focusing on it. I hope that I had just purchased the early edition, with these errors being corrected in a second printing, but I did find this rather disappointing."
3,Overrated,"The characters didn't seem particularly close when they were in college, much less some 30 years later when they hadn't kept up with each other at all. I must have missed something. I can't imagine why Good Morning America recommended this read for a male book club. There are certainly better stories about women out there."
2,Dopey and dippy,"I was there, at college in 1964, so I know what it was like to be a ""last girl."" But why revisit yet again? So many writers born when I was (1946) think readers want to know what went on in their youths. Boring. Harriet is a pain in the neck, the other women are stereotypical. The only thing that kept me reading was Smith's sense of humor. I had to skip some pages - long winded Southern history. Who cares? P.S. I have read many or all of Smith's books and found them fascinating. This is just a romance novel."
2,Not what I expected,"The corkscrew is sturdy enough but the hinges are very stiff, making it less easy to use, unlike the ones I'm used to seeing in restaurants and wine stores."
1,Didn't Last a Day,"I'm a server at a high volume Italian restaurant with a fairly large wine program - I need a durable wine key. This wine key broke on the first day of using it, after maybe the third bottle. While turning the screw into the cork, the screw stopped turning, but the handle did not and I nearly tore the body of the wine key from the screw. I've never heard of this happening before and since it can't be blamed on wear and tear I have to assume it was just extremely poor quality. I can't recommend this product to any one."
4,"Great corkscrew, with one ""complaint""...","Everything here is great, except for the knife. It is too serrated, so doesn't cut foil tops very well. It will work, but if you really don't like it, get a separate cutter. The corkscrew itself, with the dual hinge, is great. Wouldn't use anything else!"
1,Works well but over priced!,"I bought this corkscrew to open wine bottles and it works well as a opener. It also includes a regular bottle opener which is great. However, I feel that it is over-priced. I've seen similar openers for around $3, if you are looking for a wine bottle opener just head over to your local wine shop or grocery store and I bet you'll find one for less."
1,Beware cheap knock-offs!,"The genuine Pulltap is a great wine opener. But do beware cheap knock-offs being sold on Amazon! Wine Reserve, Inc., just sold me a no-name imitation of poor quality. I'm returning it. I'll buy this item locally instead so I know I get the legitimate item, made in Spain, of high quality. I suggest you do the same.*****UPDATE (29 Nov. 2011): This listing has been updated and it is no longer listed as a Pulltap brand. One step in the right direction!"
1,"Don""t wast your time buying one","I'm a bartender we go thru hundreds of bottles a wine a week. I ordered my wine key a month ago when it finally came in the very first bottle I tryed to open the worm bent, and with in a week of use it the corkscrew was complely str8. If I could send it back I would by far the worst wine key I've ever owned. it must of been made out of tin! Thanks for reading this."
5,Functional,"This corkscrew is not fancy, but it is very functional, will get the job done quickly, and is super easy to use."
1,CHEAP KNOCKOFF,DO NOT BOTHERIT IS A PIECE OF CRAPTHE WHOLE REVIEW THING IS A FARCESHOWS IT AS GENUINEIT IS NOT
1,Not worth the money,"I work as a bartender and occasionally have to open that bottle of wine or two a shift. This corkscrew is not that great. My main complaint with this item is that the screw is actually pretty dull especially once the black coating is put on it. Because of this, the corkscrew mostly mangles the cork and leaves it a mess once you're done opening the bottle. It is nice that the part that catches the lip of the bottle is semi hinged but the indented portion is pretty flimsy at actually catching the lip. My final grievance with this item is the knife on it. The serration is nice but the catches on the knife make it hard to fold out and the fact that the knife is placed at the top just really annoy me. Just a personal preference but it doesn't interfere that much with the functionality of the knife. But in all honesty, this wine tool isn't all that great and I've had better and sturdier ones for much less than what this one is sold for."
5,"Wow, what a deal","I am not a waiter that serves wine, an overseas traveler, or a wine expert. I am just a Joe Schmo that was looking for a corkscrew. I read the reviews on Amazon, and noticed this item had an average customer rating of 5 stars. Boy, were these customers on the money. I bought this rascal and am absolutely amazed that such a simply constructed tool can be so efficient. It works great. All the other fancy schmancy corkscrews may be cool to look at, or lend some self-prestige to the owner. Whatever, blows your skirt. This baby is all anyone needs to open a bottle of wine and enjoy it. Although I enjoy and trust shopping on Amazon, readers should note that this item is available at some stores for $10."
5,Makes my job so much easier!,"My catering event supervisor advised me in buying a double hinged waiter wine key instead of using my fancy wine key. This item is great! I can open wine bottles so much faster, which is crucial in a fast work environment. Now I only need to pay attention that the other team members return it to me after borrowing it..."
2,Broke immediately,"Opened up two wine bottles before the mechanism snapped. While I am still able to use it, all of its parts are unhinged and unwound so that it is difficult to keep any of its parts stable and still."
2,Good but not great.,"I was deciding between this corkscrew and another on Amazon for around $13. I wish I had bought the $13 one. This one isn't bad and I use it. The foil knife is lousy... I sharpened it which makes it better but not as good as others I've used. Also the screw has some sort of black finish that is not as slick as bare steel... the finish on screw makes removing the cork a bit tougher than it should be. The hinge system works great. By the way, I have no idea if the $13 corkscrew works any better so beware."
3,A lot wider and thicker than expected.,The wire is a lot wider and thicker than expect. The wire itself is of very good quality. I used it under the carpet. The regular non flat wire probably would have worked just the same since this one is not very flat.
4,hot and cool,the vampire tarot is like the dark brother of the well known rider -waite deck.....however not as cryptic as the thoth tarot which is too dark and forboding .....cool - austere and thought provoking this mystic prefers it to all (alternative ) decks reccomended and more than happy it is in my collection if you want rich colors and meaning and a sardonic take on the white bread -habitral of life then get this deck.....peace K
4,Best film,This film is a classic story with real characters played by some of the best actors. Warren Beatty outdid himself in his directing. It is a keeper.
4,An underappreciated movie.,"This was a well conceived, well researched and very well produced film. The script was excellent and a cast of first rate actors gave outstanding performances. Warren Beatty's direction was flawless and he received the only Oscar for this film. Instead of Chariots of Fire, an entertaining production, this film should have received the Oscar that year. I have seen it three times, read the books it was based on, and would love to own this film on DVD."
5,"DVD, Reds","The DVD was in excellent condition when we received it. THE SELLER MAILED IT PROMPTLY and we received the DVD on December 27th. However, I felt that Amazon gave a misleading statement on the beginning page stating that if we ordered by a certain time we would receive the order for Christmas. As soon as I entered my credit card number a page popped up with a message that it would not be shipped until Dec. 29th."
1,Not what it sems to be,"The title of this book looks like a good book. But the decriptions of the names are wrong. The writers of the book are not Armenian so thy did not write a acurate book. The decriptions are WRONG. The book says some Armenian names comes from Hebrew and Persis which is not true, infact its the oposite. Dont buy this book it is a Propganda."
4,"Read it, but critically","This book is a milestone in contact-linguistics. However, it is worthwhile to read Uriel Weinreich's 1953 Languages in Contact first, which is not outdated despite its date. Thomason & Kaufman are at times simplistic in their discussion of social factors as the primary determinant of language change outcomes, and the linguistic factors they accept as important in determining the outcome of language-contact should not be taken without a grain of salt. For example, 'universal markedness' is a concept which should be booed at every time it is used.On the whole, however, this book is a clear, insightful and complex discussion of the mechanics of language-contact (incidentally, it is much better than Thomason's later book on the same subject, Language Contact: An Introduction)."
1,Eyewitness: Rockand Mineral,"Dated and should be replaced. This series when it first came out were good, but todays standards, no."
5,"Patty's Back, and Better Than Ever!","The two year drought is over! ""That's The Kind Of Mood I'm In"" is one of her best ever. An excellent, upbeat song with great instrumentals (especially the bass back beat) and her voice has never been better. If radio gets it's act together, this is definitly Number One bound"
5,"Foot-stomping, head-shaking fun","I'm not a big Led Zeppelin fan, but there's very little not to like about this double-disc set if you like the Crowes. The beefy, crunchy sound is amped up and enhanced tremendously by Jimmy Page. The actual vocals are a little muted from the conversion from the live concert, but you can't mistake Robinson's voice. If you like the Crowes, you'll definitely like this set. A must have, I'd say. Highlights are the bluesy songs."
5,Outstanding,Ive been a Jimmy Page and Black Crowes fan for years and this CD is amazing. Chris and Rich Robinson tighten up the old Zep classics and invigorate them with Crowes energy which gives them newfound vitality. This also clearly shows the Zep influence in the Crowes style. A must have!
2,Crowes As Cover Band,"Yeah, yeah...I know everyone has been raving about this CD. But personally, I'd rather have live versions of Crowes tunes than ""Crowes do Zeppelin"".Of course it sounds great...the guys are amazing musicians after all. But I'm MUCH more interested in hearing some BC stuff than tired Zep tunes.If you want Zep, get their boxed set, just don't forget that the Crowes have PLENTY of their OWN great songs that you should look into.Save your $$ for THEIR next CD!"
2,WAS THIS REALLY NECESSARY,"No doubt that this will attract negative votes. Attacking sacred cows is never easy. PAGE was always an excellent studio muso who could never produce the same quality work live. This live CD proves his mediocrity yet again. The solo in the BB KING cover is emberrassing and wouldn't win a pub gig audition. The ZEP covers are as good as any other ZEP tribute band, but totally unneccessary as the originals can not be improved upon. If PAGE doesn't need the money, he should keep his legacy intakt by refusing any further live shows and the BLACK CROWS are better off sticking to their 80's stadium rock rip-offs."
4,I like the Crowes,"While this may not be their best musical outing it is pretty historic. Having Jimi Page set in with any band is historic and I am a huge Crowes fan. Not the best outing for Chris Robinson, he at times sounds like he has a head cold or his sinuses plugged with booger sugar. in any case I will not further speculate however Like I said I like the crowes and I am a Zep fan too. I found lots to like here."
5,Just excellent!!!,"This is undoubtless Jimmy Page`s best post- Zeppelin era album. Although Robert Plant insulted the Black Crowes some time ago, he should realice that they are actually a much better company for Jimmy than HE was in the No Quarter album. No weak tracks on this double Cd; Zeppelin covers and Rock and Roll classics (B.B. King, Fleetwood Mac) are equally spectacular. Chris Robinson squeezes the lemon almost like Plant did, Sven Pipien plays a superb bass solo on ""The Lemon Song"", Rich Robinson and Audley Freed are an incredible guitar duet, and Steve Gorman (although not as good as Bonham, of course) is a unique drummer. What can I say about Jimmy? The only thing I know is that his time as guitar player hasn`t come yet. This album deserves 5 stars for it`s play, sound and production, and is much better than ""The Song Remains The Same"". All of this plus an enhanced program featuring live footage."
1,NOT HAPPY WITH AMAZON,"WAS NOT THE ITEM ADVERTISED. LOOKING FOR THE ENHANCED VERSION WHICH INCLUDES 20 TRACKS ON CD2,,,WAS RETURNED BECAUSE ITEM WAS NOT AS ADVERTISEDAS THE ENHANCED VERSION IN THE DESCRIPTION"
1,This is just sad,"I never thaught one of the greatest guitarists of all time would sell out. This cd is terrible. As the cd progresses each track gets worse. It is sad to hear Chris Robinson, a singer who can't even perform his own material well anymore ruin legendary songs of a legandary band. This cd is awful! There is nothing good about it and there is nothing else i can say!!!"
2,Dinky toy,"Four little party poppersFor just under five bucksThe packaging looks really greatAlas, the product sucksShove the car onto the tubeThen bash the launcher's topThe car shoots off about a footAnd then comes to a stopAccording to the packagingIt hasn't any wheelsSo when you're filling goody bagsGo find some better dealsI know favors are dinkyAnd this one fits that specBut I just thought I'd fill you inBefore you write that checkAmanda Richards, February 27, 2007"
5,SOLID little tambourine!,"We love this little tambourine. Got it for my son for his first birthday and would totally recommend. It is really solid and attractive, would make a great gift for a baby or toddler or child, especially because it grows with them for a long time. Unlike so many cheap or age specific toys out there.Sounds very pleasant, just a smaller version of an adult tambourine, not chintzy or flat sounding. My son and 3 year old daughter love to play with it, especially when Daddy picks up the guitar or when the other is playing on the Remo kid's Tom we have. It really is music to my ears :)"
3,Multiple Early Facets of Charles Bronson...,"The 1st of this trilogy, ""Guns of Diablo,"" apparently a 1964(?) piece, is somewhat reminicient of a milder version of ""The Magnificent Seven,"" also starring Susan Oliver. ""Cold Sweat,"" a 1970 movie, is much more traditional Bronson, with more suspense, and a spectacular car chase. The last of the three presented, ""Someone Behind The Door,"" a 1971 release, has a rather frustrating, twisted plot, limiting useage of Bronson's best acting talents. Overall, this is an interesting smorgasboard for comparison to Bronson's later, superior works."
4,Older but not bad,"I was hoping for a more up to date version of Deep Purple when I bought this. The picture quality is lacking, the sound is good. But I wasnt overly impressed with this DVD"
4,Interesting,Our family feels this series is very entertaining and informative. We ALL thoroughly enjoy them! They offer info. other books on the same topics don't.
5,What a great find!,"I have actually had this CD for a number of years. I stumbled on this artist at a fair (The People's Fair) in Denver, CO. It seems Mr. Lewis had been coming to Denver from Vermont for the fair. This CD was playing on a little player at the booth he had set up and it immediately caught my ear. I chatted with him a bit and he is a really cool guy! Since purchasing it at the fair (Mr. Lewis signed my copy), It has been played many a night at bedtime to soothe me to sleep. I also play it while reading. And it is a great CD to liten to during a rain and or thunderstorm. If you like soothing acoustic music, I say this is a must have. It goes very well with Pat Metheny's solo acoustic CD ""One Quiet Night""."
2,Not A Very Good Book!,"I was really impressed by the title of this book. But when i actually bought it, i found out that it was not very detailed. I found other books like exam cram and exam prep etc much more informative than this one. If you want my advice go for any other book but this."
4,"Incredible, virtuosic fireworks","Incredible, virtuosic fireworks from the Berend brothers. Super fast, intricate guitar and guitar synthesizer backed by masterful hyperactive drums. Similar to ELP in places. Highly recommended."
1,Waste of Money,"Well, if you decide to buy it please be well aware of what you're buying. Essentially the list of chaotically aligned nouns, verbs and phrases. These words are pronounced in English and Japanese. That's it.No context, no usage examples, no topics, nothing. How I'm I supposed to remember 300 words in 10 minutes if everything you do is just read them one by one with 5 seconds interval. Moreover you hear annoying music in background. I cannot really grasp the idea of the guys who created that piece of ... media.Summary: if you want to spend $50 go and rent 10 Japanese DVD's."
2,Sticks too short!,"Goal is fine, but the sticks are meant to be played with by kids on their KNEES. That wasn't clear to me when I bought the product."
4,Fun,"If you need more activities for your youngsters inside, this is for you. My 4 and 8 yr olds play with this, they enjoy it."
2,A rip-off,Acorn was deceptive in issuing and packaging this DVD. It's a repitition one first season episodes I've seen. It was deceptively advertised by (1) calling it Set 2 (2) there were no episode numbers or titles (3) the description of the episode content picked one of several story lines and carefully selected it so it was so incomplete as to be misleading. Apparently this is a hit for them and until they develop new episodes they will repackage the old in this fashion. Shame on them.
5,great book,a must for young kids. A classic story which all youngsters should have in their library. Good art to go w/ the story
3,NOT AS GOOD AS USUALLY,"EMINEM usually releases the best rap albums,but I think this one is an exception.A lot of skits and not many songs.Maybe he was tyred or he didn't worked so much as usually ...I don't know...Only God can judge him...But he still is,in my oppinion,THE BEST RAPPER ALIVE.ROLL ON,SHADY!!!"
4,A Very Good Introduction,"Bishop Hoeller of the Gnostic Society is an amazingly intelligent and educated man, as anyone who has listened to his lectures knows. My first thought when I saw this book was that it would be a difficult read, but Bishop Hoeller has the raest of talents: an ability to communicate complex ideas in a simple manner without sacrificing accuracy.Bishop Hoeller's book is a first-rate introduction to Gnosticism in general, and I highly recommend his other books as well.Nate Merit[...]"
2,Very low budget movie!!!,"If your wish is to see a kind of apollo 13 in this, you're wrong. The specials effects are very limited and the story isn't good Well, fortunaly the cast save the movie"
3,Its okay...,Most of the rescue hero figures are pretty easy for my 3 year old twins to manipulate and assemble. This one was a little tough for them. They have not played with it as much as some of the other heroes with cool backpacks.
5,My 4-year old's favorite book - by a landslide,"My son and I LOVE this book. It takes a solid 10-15 minutes to read, but he sits through it every time. I still enjoy the story after many, many reads. A truly wonderful story."
5,Excellent,"Although I knew absolutely nothing about aestheticism before I saw this, I got a general idea of what it was about upon seeing it. But you don't have to know about aestheticism to enjoy this. The music is wonderful as well as the cast. The only weak spot in the cast is the Duke (I forget the actor's name) who has a very annoying speaking voice during his dialogue scenes. To make up for that, however, he has quite a powerful and beautiful tenor singing voice. Highly recommended."
5,A must have!,"If you like experimental/instrumental rock, this CD is for you! Very relaxing, spacey, high quality. Listen to this CD in a dark room with a high quality sound system -- let it take you away."
3,Not bad...,"...being that not ONE original member of Quiet Riot appears on this CD (going back to the Randy Rhoads days). Paul Shortino does a good job on vocals by being himself, not imitating Kevin Dubrow. The songs are catchy (best track is ""Stay with Me Tonight"", but not as memorable as ""Cum on Feel the Noise"" or ""Party All Night"". The band's party-image also departed when Shortino replaced Dubrow, and this perhaps is what made this album a ""not so big"" hit."
2,Very light comedy,"This is what might be called a ""light romance"" and not a screwball comedy at all. It's about a family of con artists that goes straight after encountering a generous old lady. The casting is poor. (It was nearly Gaynor's last film, for obvious reasons. Richard Carlson is wasted entirely, and Fairbanks is wholly unconvincing.) There are no laughs. Some of the sets are incredibly phony. And in the end the director had to rely on a parade of pups to generate good feelings. In short, this is a time waster, alarmingly out of step with the great comedies being made at the time. It's hard to believe that Selznik could be so clueless."
2,Skipping,First disk quality was fine. Product arrived in a timely fashion but the second disk last two tracks skipped so badly they were unplayable.
4,Tejano Pop Crap? Unoriginal? I think not!!,"okay first off its not ""Tejano Pop Crap"" as one reviewer described it. The artists were taking a different approach to tropical and latin music, trying to represent more of a different Caribbean sound. Also its FAR from unoriginal. Its one of the most original things I've heard in a very long time, and I must say it is a breath of fresh air. If they were to do reggaeton they would be following exactly what everyone else is doing. (I mean come on, even Shakira did a reggaeton style song with Alejandro Sanz).It is new, and may take some time for some to get used to but I commend them for doing something different and out of the ordinary. The ballads are very light and beautiful and there are good quality songs on the CD if you give it a chance.For those of you willing to try something different and out of the ordinary, I definitely recommend this CD."
1,Terrible,"Similar to other negitive comments, this phone has many glitches. We use it for a small business and have recieved many complaints from clients and have found the system cumbersome and user-UNfriendly. Too many features that nobody would use and not enough efficiency in the ones everybody will. We're returning the system and getting a new one."
1,Game Shark Dropped The Ball,"Ok, Game Shark really dropped the ball on this one. They didn't provide enough information on the product to tell me that the game shark was only a saving device. ( I am still scratching my head on this one) The only good thing this is for is saving your memory cards on your computer, and downloading other peoples games. THERE ARE NOT CHEAT CODES ON THIS DIVICE. Who buys a game shark just to save. Don't buy this product, you will only waste your money, your time, and be very disappointed."
4,You Suck Lewis Hiigel DESTROYER OF WORLDS MY ASS!!,"this is a far more economical alternative to the AR for the original xbox. however this device won't work on M$ win 7, you need an older XP machine or the XP environment running on your PC to use it. it won't, i repeat, it won't work out of the box. you need to install the software that comes from the disc. to those whom are interested in the other uses of this device, you need to find a GSX version of KNave installer. godspeed"
2,A Good Guide Book is Sufficient,"Went to Hong Kong for the first time and wanted to do some background reading. If you're fairly familiar with world history and politics and some background on the fact that Hong Kong was a former British colony, I don't think this book offers any earthshattering insights. Furthermore, this book was poorly edited with grammar and punctuation errors.If you're simply travelling for business, a good guide book will provide much of the same information. If you're trying to open a business or office, then you will likely need a more in-depth introduction than this book provides. In addition, the authors add several personal ancedotes, which I didn't find to be particularly insightful or instructive.The bottom line is browse through this book in a bookstore first. I think you'll find that you can much of the same information by reading a good guide book or even talking to other colleagues who have travelled to Hong Kong."
3,cuisinart ICE-20,"Just made icecream once so far. I was disapointed the dapper's didn't touch the inside of the bowl, so that froze first more like ice. Next time I'm going to mix the ingredients first and put in deep freeze for about an hour and then make it in the freezer. The instructions said to be sure and have the ingredients really cold and they are right. My kids loved the icecream, I felt it needed tweaking."
5,great for its price,this machine works great for macking ice cream especially for the price i am happy with this product
5,VERY EASY TO USE & CLEAN - FABULOUS PRODUCT!,"Take some chocolate milk, cool whip and eagle brand milk. Mix together and pour in the ICE-20. In appr. 25 minutes you have ice cream that tastes like a Wendy's Frosty. Keep excess mixture in frig for later. It actually tastes better after being in the frig overnight. I was amazed how easy the ICE-20 is to clean. No salt to rinse out, no ice - just some great, smooth, wonderful ice cream. After ice cream is made, you just rinse the bowl with hot water, dry and return to the freezer for the next time. The paddle and lid are also very easy to clean. The manual says to keep the bowl in a plastic bag to prevent freezer burn. I have had my ice cream maker for appr. one month and I could not be happier so far."
4,Quick and easy ice-cream done yourself,"There is nothing better than making your own ice-cream. This ice-cream maker is easy to use, fun to operate and made cleaning as simple as can be. With the multitude of books out there, you can actually make your favorite ice cream within one-half hour to a few hours. The IC maker is easy to store, and by keeping the container in the freezer you are always ready for enough ice-cream for everyone at a moments notice."
4,"So far, so good","I ordered this ice cream maker about a week ago and got it yesterday. I immediately put the bowl in the freezer - I'm not a patient person. Then this afternoon I made the simplest recipe from the manuals that comes with the ice cream maker (the Ben & Jerry's cookbook I ordered hasn't arrived yet). It was for cookies n'cream (vanilla ice cream with crumbled oreos added during the last 5 minutes. It worked out quite well. The ice cream was soft when finished, of course, but hardened up after a few hours in the freezer. It tastes & has the exact same texture of Dreyer's cookies n'cream ice cream. All the Ben & Jerry ice creams seem to ask for eggs, and I imagine that's where they get their denser consistency. All in all, I was quite pleased.I think that they key is having a very cold freezer. Mine is at the coldest it goes and I imagine that's why I didn't need to freeze the bowl for a whole 24 hours."
4,Cuisinart ICE-20 Ice Cream maker,"I'm a little disappointed that this machine does not scrape the custard off from around the sides and bottom of the machine as it is freezing. So, I get some 'crusty' ice cream that I must scrape off sides and bottom of the freezer container."
4,Ice Cream Made Easy,"This ice cream maker is easy to use and comes with a recipe booklet. However, I refer to look on line or to improvise with my own creations.To use, simply turn the machine on and pour ingredients through the opening in the top. About thirty minutes later, ICE CREAM!"
4,satisfactory,This item makes really good ice cream. I just wish i had paid more attention to the amount of ice cream it makes. 1 1/2 quarts just isn't very much ice cream. But the machine itself does a good job.
4,Great product,"I am really happy with the ice cream maker. Honestly, my husband and I feel it was the best ice cream EVER. The only thing I wish, is that it were larger, or that it came w/two freezing bowls. It only made enough for 4 people... and so I have a feeling I'll be using it every other day!Otherwise, not ONE complaint!"
1,lesson learned,"The lesson learned from this purchase, is to open the box immediately, and give the equipment a try. Unfortunately, this ice cream maker did not get a trial run until well after it was bought. We got exactly one batch of ice cream, and that batch was finished not by the machine, but by stirring the last bit by hand. Don't know if I got the one lemon in the bunch, or if the machine is bad, but this was a bust as far as purchases go."
2,Unreliable,"It seems that the stars need to line up correctly to get this ice cream maker to function properly. When it does work, it is great. But getting the freezer bowl to freeze is not always easy. If your freezer is too full, too empty, too old, etc, you may have some difficulty.When I bought this, I planned to just leave my freezer bowl in the freezer all the time so I could make ice cream whenever I wanted it. But about half the time, my freezer bowl was not completely frozen. I would have to move it somewhere else in the freezer and wait another day and if I was lucky, it would be frozen. Maybe it was just my freezer causing the problem, but it was a pain.If it is too warm outside and your freezer bowl defrosts too quickly, you don't get ice cream, just slightly frozen mush. I reccommend going with the regular ice and rock salt machines. If you need to add more ice, you can. You aren't stuck with a freezer bowl that might not be frozen enough or defrosts to quickly."
4,Good little machine... Get a good recipe,"I have tried 4 different recipes in this machine so far. 3 were from the manual that came with the machine, and one was from the internet. All 3 from the manual did not have very good texture. The ice cream was not creamy and melty, it was either icy or fudgy. I like the machine, it is easy to use, but also quite loud. We ended up moving it in to the bathroom while it churned. I think the recipes in the manual could use some improvement so that people don't blame the machine for the ice cream not coming out very well. The recipe we tried that we got online was most like regular ice cream, but I didn't like that it had uncooked eggs in it."
3,Works,"We don't use this as often as we thought. No fault of the product, we just kind of forget about it when we put it away for the winter. When we do use it, it works well."
4,Great wedding gift idea!,I bought this ice cream maker for some friends of mine. They were very excited to get it because it was something they probably wouldn't have bought for themselves. I'm looking forward to having homemade ice cream at their house. I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a wedding girft.
1,How Many Ways Can This Ice Cream Maker Not Work?,"Funny you should ask. My wife and I received this as a wedding present this past summer and we were very excited. But, when we tried to make the ice cream, we could never get it to solidify. We would freeze the base and then chill the ""batter"" and let it spin for an hour and still no ice cream. Other problems were finding enough room in the freezer for this thing to sit in, and, if you wanted to make more than once the recipe, you would have to wait hours for the base to refreeze. Anyway, after trying a number of times, we just returned it to the place it was purchased. We took the money, and spent half of it on a cheep version from Wal-Mart which works great and uses ice cubes to freeze the ice cream."
3,Didn't work 1st time,Having to freeze the bowl before you start seems like a pain. We followed the directions taking a low fat alternative and the ice cream (milk) did not really turn out well.
1,Just disgusting!,This little machine did nothing but make a mess and leave a revolting taste in my mouth. I followed the directions exactly for about three different flavors and after countless attempts to perfect it's gross 'ice cream' I had to give up.I suggest everyone just overlooks this little mess maker. It truly is a waste of money.
1,Where the heck is it???,I really can't rate this as I haven't received it yet...ordered it exactly one month ago...they don't give you an option to reach them to find out why!!!
1,Very unsatisfied,I am so disappointed with this ice cream maker. The first time i used it i followed all of the directions carefully and it looked like soup! Then today i tried a different recipe and the same thing soup!!!I honestly though Cuisinart was an excellent brand befor this. I would be better off using a blender! The only thing that this does is basically stir this around. I would highly advice against purchasing this model.
4,Good buy.,I was very happy with this machine. The only suggestion I would make is while the icecream is still a little soft if you dont eat it all scoop it into a container to put in freezer. Its hard to get out if you keep the leftovers in the freezer bowl it double freezes. Otherwise It works well. Im looking forward to trying some new recepies.
4,Nice machine,"This ice cream maker is easy to use, but you do have to be sure the bowl is really frozen and the ingredients are very cold. First try was not so great but much better on subsequent tries and the ice cream turned out great. Much easier than old rock salt machines."
5,Cuisinart ICE-20 1 1/2 - Quart Automatic Ice Cream Maker,"Very quiet machine (compared to the older models with the ice rubbing against a metal can). Very happy with the finsished product, and clean up is very easy."
2,okay for the money,"I own this item. It could make ok ice cream, but you need to make sure that your mix is ice cold before you start. I have never been succesfull with it and am planning on buying a better machine before making ice cream again."
5,5 stars,"I had to turn a hand crank and add ice and salt to make ice cream as a kid.No more of any of that. You do have to have the container in the freezer for a day for it to work (or at least longer than the 4 hours it says). You don't have to cook the egg mixture unless you are the type that worries about everything anyway. It all turns out as well as Ben and Jerry's. All prep takes about ten minutes,you sit back, and have premium ice cream in 25 minutes."
5,"If you love ice cream, you need this machine!","I bought this machine after reading some of the reviews on amazon.com. I really didn't think making ice cream with this machine would be as easy as everyone said it was; it wasn't...it was easier. All you have to do is freeze the bowl overnight, pour in your cream, milk, sugar, etc. and in 15 minutes (if your ingredients are well chilled, 20 minutes if not) you have ice cream. The machine is VERY quite and clean-up is a breeze. Makes ices cream just like my Grandmother used to make, without the mess. If you love ice cream, you need this machine!"
1,Stops Working after a while !!!!,"The ICE-20 has been a big dissapointment for me and is not what you expect from Cuisinart products. For example, the motor in the ice-cream make stops after 5-10 minutes of operation for no reason leaving you with unfinished ice-cream sludge. Apparently this is common problem with this model.I have been told by the customer care that this happens because the ice-cream maker is running a heavy duty motor. Thats odd ! I have other appliances running in my house that use a lot more power and voltage and I dont have the same problem. In summary, it might be worth spending a bit more and buying something that is more reliable."
3,"good for sobet, not for an ice cream","Please, someone tell me what did I not get it right to have this grainy ice cream that stuck to the freeze bowl?It tastes more like a sorbet with all the ingredients I put guided by its manual.And, I am so surprised how much fat and sugar it requires to make an ice cream. Does anyone know how to make a healthy smooth ice cream recipe with low fat or non-fat options?"
1,wish i had read more reviews before buying this,"This ice cream maker has never worked for me, and unfortunately I did not keep my purchase receipt.I followed the manufacturer's recipe (included with the instructions for the ice cream maker), and directions for chilling the bowl in the freezer, but still, the cream never ""froze"" into ice cream. It became a cold, barely slushy, mixture. I've tried making it on several occasions. In other reviews, I've read that it helps to ""freeze"" the milk/cream before putting it in the ice cream maker. This just seems like too much work. I think I'll go back to using a rock salt machine.This was a disappointing purchase, especially because the Cuisinart name has other wonderful products. I do not recommend buying this product."
1,"Great product, unless it doesn't work","I was thrilled to purchase an ice cream maker that would make ice cream with the touch of a button. However, after only a month of using the ice cream maker, following manufacturer instructions, the inner gel that is supposed to freeze solid to make the ice cream cold, ceased to freeze. It could never freeze solidly.I called to get a replacement bowl and was told that not only would I have to pay to ship the old bowl back, but I would also have to pay for them to ship me a replacement bowl. This is absolutely ridiculous.Considering the CSR explained to me that it was company policy, I guaranteed them I would never purchase a Cuisinart/Conair product again. It is unfortunate, as I have often heard good things about their brand."
4,Excellent,"I bought this ice cream, sherbert and yogurt for my mom for mother's day and she loved it. The only complaint that we had was having to freeze the bowl for hours. We were just to excited to make ice cream that we had to wait. The color is great especially for the price."
4,"Makes dairy-free ice cream, too!","I rarely buy ice cream for my family because 3 of us are on dairy-free diets and the soy ice cream is too expensive. But I bought this and a book of vegan ice cream recipes and have had wonderful, inexpensive results. I keep the freezing bowl in the freezer constantly, but it doesn't take up too much space because I can store other things in it. The bad news is, the freezer bowl is lined with Teflon and the the mixing paddle is plastic... after hearing that freezing plastic releases BPA's, and Teflon factory workers are getting diseases... Dear Cuisinart, please no Teflon and freezing plastic, thank you."
3,Flavor Great - Texture Waxy,"I love this machine. It doesn't need ice and salt, it's compact and my wife says it looks good when it's out on the counter (that is a big plus!) and the cost was perfect. I find when the tub is cold, the consistancy is what I would expect before freezing it in my freezer.The only thing is, my ingredients taste GREAT going in (using recipes that come with it) but when they're mixed, they have a waxy after taste. This is the case even after it's been frozen in the freezer. Also, chunks of my fresh strawberries are as hard as rocks! Maybe I'm doing something wrong?!?"
5,Dangerously Delish,"I bought this for my son for his birthday. Wow, is it easy and delicious. A person could be in real trouble with this ice cream maker sitting around.We first made the vanilla recipe and it was better than wonderful...just a few ingredients into the bowl and away you go. Fat City is on the horizon. I love it. Thank goodness my son lives 1000 miles away or I would be in real trouble with this little machine. The price is good and the ice cream is wonderful. Wonderful gift."
1,Sail Servo Problem,The 815 Servo was purchased for my remote control sailboat. The first one lasted about 9 months with occational use then it burned out. I sent it back to Hi Tec for warranty and they repaired the unit free. In the same time frame I purchased a second 815 and installed it in my boat. This one lasted about 30 minutes and started making strange noises and working very slowly. I removed it and sent it back to Hi Tec also.Due to this problem I do not recommend this servo. If I continue to have this problem I will go with a Futabo servo as fellow sailers are using.
2,This book only gets you to first base.,"This book does fairly well (but not wonderfully) to describe the basic concepts to the beginner, and it gives you some code to get started on. After reading this book and completing the examples, I only barely know enough to get started with ATL. If you buy this book you will soon need to read another just to feel competent in ATL.The first 75 pages are a very basic overview of templates and COM. The book then introduces ATL's implementation of IUnknown, IDL, Aggregation, IDispatch and Dual Interfaces, Connection Points, and Active X controls in the middle of the book. This content is covered in no real detail. The section (paragraph?) on marshalling is so thin that no useful information could be gained from it. Tacked on to the end are sections on Asynchronous Download, COM threading, MFC, and COM +. Without a detailed understanding of the core concepts of ATL, these sections are useless."
3,fairly good,"This workout is fairly good. There is a warm-up, aerobics, floor work, barre work, and exercises for your arms and waist."
3,Cute Vignettes,"This book held tangible vignettes of everyday things. It was a pleasure to read, but not a book that stayed with me after I finished reading it."
3,metallica doesnt sound good in death,"In my opinion this is a weak tribute album, metallica just does not sound that good in a death metal genre. Most songs like ""whiplash"" or ""jump in the fire"" become repitive. Steel Prophet however does a good cover of fade to black (as always) damage inc. is also a very good song done fast. Dont buy this unless your a pretty big metallica fan. Or if your into their new stuff."
4,Interesting,"This tribute was a interesting variation of well-known Metallica songs. If Metallica started their career by covering other bands (NWOBM), it is fair that new bands cover their stuff as well. All in all these bands tend to do a good job, and as I said above death-tising Metallica is always interesting."
2,Not as good as the REAL Metallica,"Metallica is trash metal, But these characters sing it as death metal, and in my oppinion they ruin the songs, It was nice of them to try but I wouldnt get it unless you had money to burn and just wanted to look at it."
1,Now I know why the LDS church wouldn't publish it.,"I have always admired BH Robert's contributions to history. What I failed to realize was that he should have stuck to history and keep his private theories private. Why wouldn't the LDS church sponser his book? I had hoped for some interesting tidbits gleaned from his years of access to church records and journals. Maybe something the church didn't want to get out.Naaa,, They just didn't want to be associated with some of his really stupid and undoctrinal theories. I was very dissappointed with the book."
5,Too Good!,Item arrived quickly and was in better condition than I expected!!! Shipping cost were lower than expected.This was probably the best transaction I have ever done on the internet:-) I would definitely purchase from them again.And their proceeds go to help children around the globe. How great is that!!!!!!!
4,Mel C is very talented!!,"Well, I admit this is the only one cd of Mel C I own, coz through years I've lost my ""passion"" for the Spice Girls and their single members. Anyway I loved this album from the first time I heard it, although there are some songs I regularly skip. My fav ones are Northern Star (maybe also Mel thinks so as she named her album just like my fav track, Goin' Down, Feel he Sun and Never Be The Same Again, but I listen glady about all the songs. I don't like very much I Turn To You (I dunno why she chose this track as single)and Suddently Monday. This last is a bit silly but I understand Mel wanted to put different kinds of genres!! I don't think this is an album only for the Spice lovers, I would recommend it to anyone (apart from people fond of heavy metal music), it contains rock songs, some pop and other slower...if u have the possibility to find this album, buy it! :0)"
5,Strong All Along,"Wish's major label debut is a tough, melodic set of gnarled, post-punk hard rock. An easy comparison is Dinosaur Jr, but Wish's music is closer to the country-rock leanings of The Presidents Of The United States Of America - underneath their loud, grungy guitars there is a distinct rootsiness lacking in most Seattle bands and that give Strangest Places its edge. [Strangest Places is also available import release.]"
1,No talent ass clowns,"Wow, this show sucks. A lot of times what happens to me is people recommend stuff to me, or I read about it on the internet randomly, so I request it from the library and it takes weeks to come in and by the time I watch it I have no idea who recommended it to me or what point of reference I'm supposed to be watching the show from. But in any case, this show bites to the degree that I can't believe I don't have my own show on HBO if they're gonna produce crap like this. I could call it 'Girl who does nothing but sits around the house and laughs at her own farts' and it would be a hundred times better than Mr. Show. There, I said it."
4,A Nice Introduction,"I found this book while looking for a way to get my children more interested in art and famous artists from various periods. This book was exactly what I needed. It tells a little about each artist without being boring giving them a glimpse at each one. After reading this book to my 3 year old and then letting the 11 and 15 year old look it over, I was asked about various artists in the book which led us on hunts at the library for more information.So this book makes a good introduction if you're wanting to just give your kids an idea of all the artists that have come and gone. I do agree with another reviewer that it would have been nice if they had included at least one piece of their artwork in the pages. Of course, that just means we will have to find them on our own which for us homeschoolers is part of the ""thrill of the hunt""."

5,Honor and Heroism Personified,"If Sen. McCain weren't so humble on the campaign trail, and every American knew the story of his life as told in this book, he would be elected in a landslide. This man personifies honor."
5,I enjoyed this autobiography of a living American hero,"Sen. McCain's story should be recommended reading for our young men who are looking for a living hero to emulate. His extraordinary courage in the Hanoi prison camp, despite the fact that his captors wished to exploit his status, is a lesson for all of us."
4,Good Commentary on a Rough Time,I admire John McCain for the tremendous suffering he endured at the hands of his captors in Vietnam. I couldn't give this book 5 stars because it is a little too self-serving; the stuff about his father and grandfather isn't all that interesting. His experiences in the prisoner of war camp are. I wish he'd written more about that.
5,I just think it's great,"I chose this because John McCain wrote, and I would suggest it to someone else to read on that reason alone. However, it is a great read and very interesting."
5,Faith of my fathers,"Faith of My Fathers is not just a testament to Sen McCain's courage and devotion to duty. It clearly spells out C-H-A-R-A-C-T-E-R, a trait sorely lacking of late in our society. McCain comes across not as Superman but as a person of great humility and determination. His descriptions of his ordeal at the hands of his captors are riveting. His admiration of the heroism displayed by most of his fellow prisoners is apparent throughout the book. The fact that McCain does not name the two US collaborators in his book is eveidence of his dignity and class. This is an exemplary work by a proud man."
1,Terrible Toaster,"I bought this toaster and it is terrible. The lever broke off after a minimum number of uses. The toast would constantly pop up before it was done. Also it was difficult to program....the toaster would jam and make a horrible noise, even when the toast was not jammed in the machine."
1,"Short term performance, long term regrets...","I decided it was time to chuck the old 1960's toaster about 3 years ago. I bought the Cuisinart at the recommendation of Consumer Reports. I was bamboozled. The toaster has always been slow and results in uneven color. Never found that the defrost feature was worth a hoot. Now it will only badly toast 2 slices and than refuses the work again for 20 minutes. I have resurrected to old 60's appliance. The toast isn't perfect, but at least we can all eat the same time now!This toaster is a dog...."
3,"Pretty good toast, but .....","During 3 years of owning this toaster we had to get it replaced twice. Both times the knob for pushing down the toast broke. What an annoyance! However, when it was working, this toaster made very good toast, and warmed bagels just fine. It has a very nice appearance, and I must say the Cuisinart company was good about replacing their product. Now if they could just figure out a way to improve that knob ....."
1,Too bad it doesn't work very well,"I had high hopes. It looks like a perfect toaster. It can handle two bagel halves easily, a super long sour dough, or two pieces of regular sandwhich bread. It has was appears to be useful setting buttons. But in the end, it toasts unevenly. VERY unevenly. As a rule, it burns the top and fails entirely to tast the bottom. So unless you plan to hover over you toast and flip it, I'm afraid this isn't the unit for you."
1,Bad Toaster Experience!!!!!,"After years of good toast, but a broken, ugly toaster, my husband finally bought us this new toaster. The first time I used it filled our home with a very strong burned plastic smell. I couldn't find any plastic in the unit at all, so I figured maybe it was just because it was the first use of the toaster (although that still didn't seem right). I gave it two more tries, and STILL get a bunt-plastic smell (though not as strong as the first time). Anyone else experience this??? The toast burned also! It has a fancy-sounding ""custom control"" feature. Well, this only works if the toaster remains plugged in. Once the toaster is unplugged,you lose all of your settings. Here's the caveat--the instruction manual tells you top unplug the toaster when not in use!! Huh???? I called the custumer service #, and after 3 tries finally got a nice lady who told me to return to to the store and get something else. It is boxed up and ready to go! No more cuisinart for us!!!"
4,The great book to read Duel,"DuelI think that if you like a book with different stories in it then you would like this book. It has different stories that will keep you on your feet. There are sad stories and there are scary stories. I liked how the stories switch because it keep me wondering how that story would really if the story went on. The fact that the stories don't end like you thought they would is another good reason why to this book. It keeps you thinking on how the story would end. I liked how they put the different stories in order, like how they didn't mix up the stories they put different scary stories with not so scary but thrilling stories."
2,Not quite what it is marketed as,"Besides the title story (written in the early seventies) these are essentially science fiction stories written in the 1950's (rather than the straight horror that the book's cover seems to indicate). While these stories are fascinating as a product of their time, don't expect them to read as anything other than very dated.Matheson does include an element of horror in each story and that is generally the least dated, most successful aspect. If you don't mind the seriously lame 50's B movie sci fi trappings and the humorously outdated mores that appear in this collection, you can really see why Matheson would come to be a well regarded horror writer in later days."
4,Worth Reading for SciFi Fans,"Mateson is a great writer of thrillers, horrors and Sci-Fi and combines them all in these succinct yet entertaining stories of what could be..."
5,The Best Season of the Best 80's TV Series Ever!!!,"Absolutley love this season. Yeah, Super Pursuit Mode can be perceived as cheesy now, but 20 years ago, it was the best. You can say a lot of things from the 80's were cheesy, but let's get back to Knight Rider.I was 9 years old when this show came out. And when you are that age, and a TV show comes out with a talking car and a driver with the same first name as you (Michael), you're sure to become a huge fan.In addition to SPM, they got EBS and a new convertible roof for K.I.T.T.! And how could we forget, Michael and Stevie finally get married in the episode titled ""The Scent of Roses."" ""Killer K.I.T.T."" was great too. Gotta own this season. It's a must have. Hasselhoff for president!"
2,"Attractive, but flimsy. . .","While this is an attractive teapot, I am disappointed by the quality of its construction. First, the glass is EXTREMELY thin; also, the lid does not sit tightly on the body of the teapot. The teapot is very small (which I knew beforehand)--so while it's suitable for the person I'm giving it to, I would not recommend it to those wanting to make more than 1 cup of tea at a time.For the price, I expected more. Next time, I will invest in a teapot of higher quality."
4,Handy little book.,"This is a handy little book for anyone that is trying to come up with a rhyme. I have not checked out the other books on this subject so I cannot compare it to them.There once was a time, that I need a rhyme.So I picked up this book and took a look.And out of the pages the words did rampage.Until one all alone helped finish this silly poem."
2,"""no talent metal"" is dead in my book","when I was a young and immature lad, I liked this kind of music. Now that I am somewhat musically advanced, whenever I hear this kind of brainless metal, I feel sick. The only reason it gets an extra star is because of the (although sometimes indiscernable) Christian lyrics. I still like the melodic metal of Metallica better, and I still listen to their music once in a while.Don't get too mad...Peace out."
1,Not Recommended,This book seems to be taken from information published many years ago. Many of the articles refer to building construction from the early 1900's. I was disappointed with this book.
1,WHY!,This book is by far the most boring thing ever written. The only reason I can find for someone to ever want to read this thing is if you are being forced to. I have fallen asleep at least 3 times while reading this because it simply just is not interesting. The book rambles on about things and just continues digging deeper into the issue and manages to circle around and end up right back to where the writer began. Ultimately reading this book has been pointless and extremely boring. Do not read this it is a waste of time.
5,Satisfied,Satisfied with the product received. It was exactly as described. A few pages have light writing on them but does not affect the use of the book...it gets written in anyway.
5,Bad Ass,"This stuff is the real deal, been on it now for about 6 months and have seen increases in all weight lifting in the gym as well as adding size to my arms and chest, stacked with no xpolde and nitrix, real results real fast."
3,"Book not bad, support not the greatest thing in the world.","Book seems OK. However if you're thinking about emailing them for a question/corections, I suggest that you don't. You're never gonna get a reply back anyways."
3,"Not bad, but I would buy the New Riders next time","This book is just OK. I think the format is very dull, but it will get you where you want to go if you have experiance. I found it lacking in certain areas, especially when it comes to all of the switches for different utilities. Also I do not think that it goes in depth enough on certain subjects. Not that it is a bad book, but I do think that there are better. I'm not new to this as Exchange 5.5 was my 6th exam, and I am now an MCSE. There are definately better study aids available. P.S. Try to find a book that includes the Eval edition of Exchange 5.5 if you do not have access to an Exchange server. This will help a LOT!!!!!!!!!! Good Luck to all."
2,I would get something else,"So, yeah, this blender is pretty, and my occasionally-used 6-year-old model IS still running, so I'm giving it an extra star for that. However, every time I blend something from ice to berries it smokes and emits terrible burnt-rubber smell. I really can't overdo it. I've been terrifed to use it very often or for anything heavy-duty. I do not think anyone who wanted to use this more than occasionally would get much use out of it."
1,Not worth a single star,I was fool enough to buy a second when the first broke after less than a year. I thought I just had a lemon. The second burned out on the second use making a smoothie. It couldn't handle ice! Wnat a terrible product! I can't believe I wasted my $.
1,Disappointing,"Underpowered. This thing just does not perform. And now, after about a year of use, the cutting assembly is cracked. Replacement, with shipping, is about 1/3 the cost of a new blender. Here's more junk for the land fill!I replaced this blender with a Vita-Mix. It's expensive, but it's worth it! Fast, powerful, and easy to clean."
2,Seems to have some design flaws...,"I bought this blender at a department store yesterday. Brought it home and proceeded to make a smoothie. As soon as things liquified, everything started leaking out the bottom. Upon further investigation, my husband and I discovered that the collar could not screw down tight enough to seal the gasket against the glass, hence the leaking.I wonder if this is why someone else had to replace a cracked collar. I suppose if you were to be able to tighten the collar enough it might stress it to the point of breaking.Perhaps we just got a lemon, but based on the other reviews here the chances are that it's not a good design to begin with.We returned ours for a refund and are re-thinking our selection."
2,Plastic Wheel in Bottom broke on mine too!!,"I wonder if there is a true flaw in this machine -- so many people have had this same plastic piece in the base break!! I just sent mine back for the second time to have the piece repaired. Each time costs $26.00 plus the shipping of the base to their Repair Center. But, I bought the chopper attachement for this too so I figured....Hey Cuisinart! If you are reading this, time to make better machines! If it breaks one more time I will not get it fixed."
2,Blends OK While the Plastic Lasts,"The glass jar is fine, the metal blade seems fine but the overall construction is flimsy plastic, which might be tolerable if not subjected to stress. However, as I found out, the flimsy plastic impeller which drives the blade and therefore is directly subjected to stress snapped for no apparent reason rendering the entire blender discardable junk."
4,"Decent blender, good price","This is a decent, mid-range blender. We've had ours for nearly 7 years now and the black gear finally gave out. I found a replacement part on smallappliance.com (search for cuisinart and then choose the model from the list, SPB-7). Easy and cheap fix. Until I have the disposable income for a Vitamix or Blendtec I'll just stick with this one.It does have trouble with thick mixtures, they have to be pushed down often. But for the light duty blending and occasional milkshake or smoothie, this blender has served us well."
2,Low Quality & Poor Design,"My first blade insert broke after only a few uses. The second one cracked after a similarly short period of time. It's multi-piece base is a pain to clean, and it is rare that whatever I am blending doesn't leak all over the counter from the poor seal formed by the parts fitting together with the class pitcher."
1,Disappointed!,"I received my blender/processor as a gift and I use it occasionally (especially for smoothies and mixed drinks). I was disappointed when the clutch assembly broke! I couldn't believe that Cuisinart doesn't have a durable piece sitting at the motor. I contacted Cuisinart and they said it's not possible to repair on your own--that brass piece needs to be removed by qualified personnel! I'm so glad I ran into these reviews! Anyhow, I compared my blender to my parents' (Oster brand), and they have a much durable design. I'll make sure I inspect any small appliance before I make a purchase! In this case, it was a gift so I can't complain. I'm going to purchase the clutch assembly as recommended by one of the viewers. The Cuisinart name doesn't always equal high quality."
5,Good.,Well designed. Fits comfortably on my very limited kitchen space. A tad smaller than other models which works for me.
2,Buy a different one...,The major problem is the blade spinning mechanism stiffens up when not in use and the motor cant get it going.....mine was smoking in less than 4 seconds. Nothing good to say. Don't waste your money.
1,Plastic issues...,The plastic surround at the bottom cracks and resulting in messy leaks.Plastic continues to be a problem for Cuisinart. It's like the don't understand the properties of the various materials used and/or the stress points that will eventually break.
3,what a GREAT BUY!!! thanks to last reviewer..,looks like I might have bought the last reviewers blender!!I got mine at good will for .. yes.. $1!!!!thankyou! work great for the price I paid.
5,"This Blender is at the Top of My ""Wish List""","Lots of power in this ""sci-fi"" style blender with a modern appearance out of the ""X-files"". The black and stainless steele color combination will update any decor. Cuisinart makes a first quality product and this one is definitely built to last. The seven speeds provide maximum versatility for the most serious of cooks (or for those of us who like to make our lives in the kitchen simplier and easier!) This product is at the top of my ""wish-list"". It makes many formerly tedious jobs a breeze. Make your own milkshakes and (preservative-free)baby food. Crushes ice too, which is an unexpected bonus from a blender now that summer's around the corner."
1,Cuisinart 7 speed blender,"I bought this as a gift and would love to have one for myself.Cuisinart is a great brand name and the products are high quality.Five stars for me!These small appliances last years, a great investment.Buy one for you and one for me! LOL"
1,Doesn't do the job,"I've had this for a couple of years. I'm a big fan of smoothies. Although the blades are still sharp, never once did I have a perfectly smooth result with this machine. The authorized Cuisinart repair shop I took it to said it is because the blades are housed in too deep. Plus the jar is very heavy and hard to handle when washing."
1,Plastic gear mechanism broke,"After using this blender for about 3 years for blending softer food, I started making smoothies recently in it using frozen strawberries, milk and yogurt. The frozen strawberries must have been too much for it despite the liquid in there. The black gear mechanism that turns the blades broke. I can't find where to buy a replacement part or where to buy a replacement for the bottom of the blender (not the pitcher) so I bought another brand and will probably trash this one. So disappointed in Cuisinart since they have a good reputation for other things."
2,Doesn't last long...,"I thought this blender was a good deal when I bought it, but I was mistaken. When I first used it, it gave off an odd smell, like burning plastic. I thought that simply might be a factor of the newness and expected it to go away with time. Months later, it still smelled every time I used it. Not only that, it was LOUD. With every use, I had to tolerate the loud whining sound of the motor. One day, it simply stopped rotating the blade. It turned out that the black plastic wheel on the base (the one that couples with the wheel on the bottom of the blender pitcher to spin the blade) just broke in two, thus rendering the base useless. I was very disappointed. After reading the trouble people have had with customer service at Cuisinart, I decided it was too much trouble to seek a repair/replacement from them. I simply bought another brand that I hope will provide better, more reliable service."
1,SUCKS!,This blender sucks! It does not work! Everything just sits there and I have to use a spoon every few seconds to mix it up. DO NOT BUY THIS BLENDER! It will save you time and a headache you if buy a different one.
1,Gave it one star because I am in a charitable mood,"Cuisinart, I thought, built quality products. Then they started manufacturing this mess that they call a blender. What a stretch to call it a blender! It needs help to puree the ingredients for a smoothie (you must frequently STIR the ingredients yourself.) The blade assembly eventually cracked. There is now a black residue around the black whirly thing on the base. My husband thinks that it over heated. All that damage from making SMOOTHIES?! Yep. Cuisinart take note-I AM NOT BUYING CUISINART PRODUCTS AGAIN. I would venture to guess others feel the same. I'm happy that some folks had a good experience with this ""blender"" but I am not one of them."
2,Do not buy this,"We have had this ""blender"" (in white, not pink) for two years. I should have returned it on day two which I was very tempted to do at the time. #1: it is way too noisy. #2 the plastic teeth break - Cusinart has been kind enough to replace these - twice - in two years. Now they are broken again. We are buying an Oster or Waring or something that hopefully will be more than a throw away."
1,ok blender until the blade housing cracks,"Cuisinart SPB-7PK SmartPower 40-Ounce 7-Speed Electronic Blender, PinkThis is an ok blender until the blade housing cracks. Then it leaks all over the blender and turns into a piece of junk. I replaced the blade assembly myself at my cost the first time, but then it broke again within 6 months. Cuisinart will not do anything about it and just says they will tell the engineers about the problem for future reference. They also say the replacement part is handled by a third party and they will not cover it either. ""It isn't our fault that we made a defective part"" is apparently their attitude. Last Cuisinart appliance for me."
1,Something went wrong...,"After using this blender for about 6 months, something inside the base of the blender came apart. I haven't opened it to look, but when I ran the motor, I could hear something inside the blender being whirled around, and could actually see sparks inside the base!JUNK! It's getting thrown away. Looks dangerous to use at this point."
1,I want my old Osterizer back,"I had an Osterizer blender for about 15 years that reliably made banana smoothies nearly every morning (frozen peeled ripe banana + milk). The corner of the glass chipped, and so we replaced it with this Cuisinart about 1 month ago. It has been a big disappointment. It takes way too long to blend. I think it might be because the base is too wide and pieces of partially blended bananas or ice get trapped under the blades and don't get blended. It's also really noisy. I'm ready to toss it and get another Osterizer."
1,believe the bad news,"Thanks to the reviewers who warned of breakage, I avoided this blender, though I own 3 other Cuisinart products I'm very happy with. I really had no idea how common the problem with the black impeller disk was, but I went ahead and got an Oster beehive instead; it's built like a tank. So yesterday I was in Macy's and saw someone looking at the Cuisinart. ""Listen,"" I told him, ""I've heard this thing breaks a lot. This piece here."" And I removed the jar and pointed. ""It's already broken,"" he said, and sure enough, the disk had cracked into 3 pieces. On the display model!Cuisinart really should revamp this [thing]."
1,Cuisinart & Amazon Inexcusable Continuance,"Why is Cuisinart continuing to sell this shoddy and defective blender? Worse, why is Amazon continuing to allow this product to be sold to it's customer base? Apparently there is no accountability here on either Cuisinart or Amazon, unacceptable behavior in the consumer world.If you're thinking about buying this product, run away (and stay clear of Cuisinart altogether as it's apparent, they don't retool defective products to improve negative company feedback). If you just purchased it, RETURN, RETURN, RETURN.As for Amazon, quit behaving like the typical bean counter and do something about the garbage you allow onto your website for crying out loud!"
5,Clarity and Presence,"The first volume of poetry produced by David Whyte, this is a book I discovered only after reading his later work. It is fascinating and instructive to see the man at the beginning of his apprenticeship, already possessing the clear vision and understated articulation in these pages that underlies his later bigger narrative poems. Many of the pieces are tight almost ritualistic exercises in attention and presence. Horses Moving on the Snow, Light Over Water. Sound Over Water. The eye and the ear refreshed and steadied by reading them at one and the same time. In the Opening of Eyes you find a glimpse of his future style, that clear imagery beginning to be wedded to insight. An economical, understated, unprepossessing little jewel of a book."
3,Some bad language,My daughter didn't care for this book because there were some bad words and foul language in it along with references to young children smoking . She is 8 years old but she decided to stop reading the book after this portion. It may be a good book for a less sensitive child but if you are carefully monitoring you might want to skip this one.
5,Wars Have Two Sides,"In this action-filled novel, Collier and Collier present both sides of the American Revolutionary War without prejudice through the eyes of a fourteen year old boy who is torn between love and loyalty to his father, who is loyal to the king, and his older brother, who strongly believes in the revolution. As the novel, which is based on a true story, unfolds the reader begins to understand how strong political convictions can tear a family to shreds, when Timmy Meeker vascilates between the two positions seeing both sides commit atrocities. The authors use irony brilliantly to depict the unfairness of war. I learned more about American history from this novel than from any history book. I would recommend this book for mature readers in the fifth grade to college students who must report on a book from the historical fiction genre. In fact, anyone who want to know more about the American Revolutionary War."
1,Not what I expected,"This book didn't turn out the way I expected. I found it to be boring, and predictable. The title gives out the whole plot for the book, which is basically just why Sam got in trouble and his attempts at escaping his fate. This book isn't very good at all, and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone."
4,My Brother Sam is Dead,"My Brother Sam is Dead is a very exciting book.It was written by James Lincol Collier and Christopher Collier. This book is about a person named Sam Meeker who left his family to go fight in the Revolutionary War.Sam fought for the Patriots.This book takes place in 1775. I really liked the discriptive words.It was easy to picture the story in my head.I liked all of the moods in the book,like when characters were mad,then they were happy. This book's theme is the Revolutionary War.One message the story has is; you should fight for what you belive in.This book is great from start to finish."
2,has it's good,"I read this book for school and I have to say it's boring, it has good parts and very little parts that make u wanna keep reading. The book's character Tim was kind of a jerk in one part why *SPOILER* when Tim and Sam's father was being harassed by a militia while Sam was at home visiting, Tim took Sam's gun to give to the militia (which is what they wanted), Sam chased him down and Tim threatened to shoot Sam, but when Sam was captured Tim runs away, come on, really what kind of brother is he, so as you can see this book sounds so exciting. But thats about it it's actually really boring and mainly about how he works with his parents and is really boring"
5,My Brother Sam Is Dead,"To my surprise my daughter loved this story! I thought it was going to be a fight to get her to read this book. It is full of 'colorful' language which middle school children enjoy, in addition to being uniquely told from a preteen boy's perspective. Excellent story! Though I should warn parents the ending can be disturbing to children. Realistic ending...might want to discuss feelings with your child upon completion."
1,Entire plot is a hole.,"This book is terrible. The main plot (that is the brother's death) consists of nothing but a giant plot hole.Sam gets executed for stealing cattle. Which he not only didn't do, there is no way anyone could have thought he actually did, since, due to his father's disappearance and presumed death, the cattle in question were actually Sam's property anyway. It is legally impossible to steal something you own. The idea that someone supposedly excellent at rhetoric as Sam was claimed to be would fail to mention this when he's up for execution is ridiculous."
3,You'll be glad Sam is dead at the end,"The book, My Brother Sam is Dead, is an OK book. You might choose this book to read if you are interested in historical novels. The book would be classified as a historical fiction-taking place during the Revolutionary war. If you are not interested in historical reads it's a good book to burn time with. The book is a first-person narrative under the perspective of a teenage boy, Tim Meeker, who helps out at a tavern his family owns. The story is interesting under Tim's view as it shows his personal opinions and thoughts. Tim's brother, Sam, leaves to join the continental army early on in the story, against his loyalist father's orders. This is an early conflict, which creates much tension throughout the story. This makes for an interesting plot and a good (in my opinion) ending. Pick up My Brother Sam is Dead to immerse yourself into the Revolutionary times or to simply kill a couple of hours"
3,"Boring, but somewhat interesting book","This book was boring, except for a few events that kept you hooked for about 1 minute, but then it went back to its slow, dull pace which is through out the whole book. The title was really strange, and I think they could of picked a better one. The ending was the best part (though it was sad) and you knew what was going to happen since the name of the book."
2,Ignores the Reason for the Revolution,"The authors fail to understand the reasons for the American Revolution. They illustrate some of the conflicting views of the times and the hardships and tragedies of war, but ignore the fundamental issue of the colonists being denied the ""Rights of Englishmen.""The colonists thought of themselves as Englishmen, and many in England agreed, but the king and parliament refused to grant them a voice in laws governing them from England - even though they had local governments for many things.At some point people must stand up and fight for their freedoms. As John Adams put it, ""I must study politics and war that my sons may have liberty to study mathematics and philosophy.""The Declaration of Independence presents the case clearly."
5,A Different View of the Revolution,"This book is historical fiction. I really liked it because it portrayed the reality of the of the American revolutionary war in a very different way than the history books. It highlighted the personal toll it took on families and neighbors and illustrated the horror of war, even a war with a just cause and a favorable outcome. I give it five stars."
3,red dawn?,"ok this movie started off good, and had me interested, but if you already have seen red dawn the 1980's American version of this against the Russian and cubans it is not so good. I won't ruin the ending but they could have had more action than what they did."
1,I wanted to shoot this movie after watching it.,"I was looking for something like Red Dawn. Old Red Dawn, New Red Dawn, this garbage doesn't come close to either. The acting was just so bad and events that were just make you scream ""That wouldn't happen"" I really had high hopes for this movie. I have not read the book so don't know how close it is to the book but have heard others say it isn't like the book. I could not believe in the characters nor that the character would do anything they did in the movie. I have done a video review on this video under Fuyingbro on youtube. Please watch it to understand how I feel. I really felt like taking it to the range and shooting it."
2,Not intersting at all,"I thought it will be a great one. that's the problem with buying books from Internet. I may never again buy unknown books from Net. If I had browsed in a store, i certainly would not have purchased this book. Interesting characters, the book is very dull.Should have pictures and be catchy. You have wade through all junk to get to the interesteing facts. Seems he wanted to increase the number of pages with less facts/ Read in a library only/"
5,Great for display and collecting.,"The Starbuck figure was a lot more detailed than I had hoped it might look. I remember when the show was first on and I had all the toys. Not one looked like who they where suppose to be representing. I am glad to say this one does look a little like Starbuck. They really nailed the uniform, and accessories. I don't intend to take him out of the package. Some people decorate with Paintings and Posters. I use items like toys that are unopened. Starbuck will make a great addition to my decor."
2,Sad book,This book was not as indicated on the description. It has been used for a college class and was written in on multiple pages. Seller did offer to have me return it but at my cost. I kept it but it is worthless to me.
4,Knit a square,"I have already made 3 of these animals, I find them really easy to knit and put together. My quilting friends and I are making them for the local hospital to give to sick toddlers when they are admitted to hostpital.I found the book to be in very good order, it actually looked as though it had never been used. Very satisfied."
3,a little too tough,"We loved the idea of this product, but soon found that the clean-up was kind of a pain. The coffee is very good, very hot, but not worth the tedious clean up. My grinder has stopped working after 2 years - but we are still using it. Great idea, just keep in mind that all of the parts make this one difficult to clean."
2,Loud and doesn't last long,"We've had ours for a couple of years. It brews good coffee, but the grinder is very loud. It didn't come with a permanent filter, we had to buy our own. And it has broken twice on us: the latch on the cover broke within a couple of months the first time, and now after another 2 years is broken again. (Without the latch to click it in place, it refuses to brew, so it is an important part.) The carafe cover also broke off on us (little tabs broke), and the part that allows placing the brewing on hold also broke on us. I recommend against buying it."
3,grinder sucks,"I've had one for a couple years now. The grinder has completely failed...seized at the motor. When it worked, it left too much coffee in the bean hopper (didn't shoot the entire coffee load into the filtre.) Still works fine for regular coffee though...and brews pretty well (albeit slowly). The spout on the carafe requires slow pouring.Love the idea. If you don't mind replacing your coffee maker about once a year, go for it. Still looking for one that is a bit more robust/reliable."
2,Great coffee but a huge pain to clean!,"We have had this model for over a year and, while it does make good coffee, it is SUCH a pain to clean. You have to remove the entire grinding/ filter mechanism each and every time coffee is made. Also, the grounds somehow wind up going everywhere and the water reservoir must be cleaned at least every 2 or 3 pots in order to keep the grounds out of your water. If I had it to do over again I'd spend the extra money and buy the Capresso machine. My mother has the Capresso and it's much better!"
2,Certianly Not The Best!,"If you are looking for the grinder/brewer, this isn't it! A couple of years ago I purchased another, more expensive, machine of this type for my home and immediately fell in love with the quality of the coffee that it produced. I became so accustomed to the flavor that I decided to purchase one for my office but didn't want to spend a great deal of money on a second machine. Well I guess you get what you pay for, because I have had numerous difficulties with this machine starting about 2 weeks after I began to use it. From a problem with the heating element, to the latch for the top cover, and subsequent erratic problems with the timer/clock display. I was encouraged at first with the quality of the coffee and the simplicity of the setup and operation of the machine. But it didn't last long. By the way, the Capresso machine I have at home still works wonderfully!"
2,The little stuff will make you throw this in the trash!,"This coffee maker makes good coffee, but all the little parts, which don't fit together quite right will make you crazy. This is a pain to clean. The basket is large and over time became more difficult to remove. After a few months, I couldn't get it out, even with a pliers. Also after a couple of months the automatic drip control broke off, when trying to remove the basket. I emailed the vendor several times more repair or a replacement part...no response. Now that the machine hasn't been cleaned properly for a few months the coffee doesn't taste that good. In the trash it goes. The machine also ""beeps"" at you a lot....like I need one more complaint! Good coffee, but needs design tweaks and customer service improvement."
1,EXPENSIVE CUP OF COFFEE,FOR THE PRICE (...) PRORATE THE LONGEVITY OF THIS MACHINE IT [...]. AFTER 6MTHS THE WATER WILL NO LONGER PUMP THROUGH. AFTER 3 MTHS FORGET ABOUT THE ELECTRONICS. CUISIARTS R AND D SHOULD TAKE LESS COFFEE BREAKS AND CONCENTRATE MORE ON DEVELOPING A BETTER PRODUCT OR WORK ON THIS ONE. I THINK I'VE BEEN HAD FOR (the cost).
3,heater element failed,"I purchased this coffee maker for my husband just over a year ago. The grinder gets damp so it needs to be cleanded and dried between uses, which can be a problem if you are serving a lot of guests. also no one can manage to pour from the pot without dripping on the counter. then finally the heater element gave out. I am shopping today for a new brand. I'm giving it 3 stars because the flavor of the coffee is excellent."
2,Only lasts 2 years,"My wife & I have owned two of these grind and brew units. Each of them stopped grinding beans after two years of moderate use - one pot per day. In our opinion, the quality of the coffee was very good, and the clean up was acceptable considering the wonderful aroma from fresh ground coffee that this machine delievered. The problem is the short lifetime of the machine. Twice burned, we will not purchase this model again."
5,nice,"Okay product, made nicly and durable. You get a good cup of coffee. After buying this I went and got a kuring k-cup which is much nicer."
5,From a homeschooling violinist in Maine,"I would recommend this book for children and adults. Newberry the clam had a friend, the barnacle. He was pretty nice. On his clam birthday, he didn't have a cake or candles, so he had a big personal feast. It didn't work out so well because he got a big bubble of gas in his stomach and floated out to Blue Hill. I don't want to give away the whole story, but his advdentures were very fun to read about.I thought it was cool how he figured out that little cells in the ocean light up.The person who loaned this book to me, also loaned me two clam shells glued together (still able to open). A friend who gave it to her, sewed a pink clam to fit inside, and crocheted a purple muffler to go around the clams neck... This little Newberry clam was fun to have around while I was reading the book.I wish Vincent Dethier would write more childrens books about Newberry."
4,well..it's a pretty good bag except one thing,that darn inner sleeve inside the smaller carrying case won't fit over my dell latitude d810... i guess i'll just put it outside the laptop but still keep it in the smaller compartment.BESIDES THAT.. it seems like a solid bag. i actually went to circut city and picked it up for $97 but returned it when i went online to see if amazon carried it. gladly they did and i saved $30.can't wait to see how it holds up to the NYC subway system.
2,"NOT THE SIZE CLAIMED. NOT THE BAG IT USED TO BE,","Amazon's description says this bag is 6.5"" wide, but actually it's not even 5"".I purchased a Kensington Contour a few years back and although it had a few quality issues (all of the zipper tags cracked and broke) it was a very good bag. I looked around (tried everywhere) and couldn't find anything better (one of the two handles had finally broken) so I decided to buy the same one. When it arrived I was very disappointed to find than an entire major compartment of about 1.5"" is no longer part of this bag, and it is less than 5"" thick, not 6.5"".Interestingly the Kensington photo of the bag on thier own label looks like my original bag. It's just not the same design or size as it used to be.I hope this might help others make the same mistake as me."
3,Has it's moments,"A fair book, as far as adventure books go. Miss Sutherland leaves you wanting more information on the history of the islands and her personal life. She touches on both of the aforementioned accounts, but does not go deep enough. She scratches the surface. The book chronicles journey's that most people do not even think about anymore, but yet the book does not capture the excitement of the journey's as it should.I did enjoy the read, and would recomend the book to hardcore outdoor enthusiasts.Tate Perazzelli (tatemar@compuserve.com"
4,Solid Genesis Emulators,Great band that follow in the footsteps of mid period genesis. The singer reminds one of Gabriel on the Lamb. Great musicianship throughout this one.
2,disappointing book,"I completely agree with the last review of this book. It also creates a distorted picture of Woody Allen, constantly discussing (and exaggerating) his neurotic tendencies and feebleness with women. It is filled with criticism and pseudo-analysis of him, and only manages to make me angry. I only read the whole book because I'm a big Woody Allen fan, and was hoping to find something that I would enjoy, but I didn't. Poorly written, researched, and a constant negative focus on Woody Allen. Don't read this book if you're new to Woody: it'll make you think he's the worst man in the world."
3,familar yet familiar ad nauseum,"R. Hillary's review hits it perfectly. Pleasant listening, but nothing new. Beck has simply run out of ideas and is now recycling everything he's done before. This works fine for many artists, but Beck set the bar for 'weird yet familiar'. Now that his weird is our familar, we're left with 'familiar yet familiar'"
1,One word: B O R I N G ! ! !,This is the sound of the artistically and creatively bankrupt.Would make a good soda commercial soundtrack...
1,Playing music while running from a charging Rhino,"If I were to place a band in the back of a pick-up truck in Africa, park right next to a feeding Rhino family and start to play... this Album would be the result."
1,DVD Compatibility Problems,"The Dolby Digital 5.1 mix will not work on my Phillips DVD player - it will only play back in Dolby Pro Logic. Additional two of the videos, the third and the last, will not play back properly - all choppy. I had no problems with the DVD version of Sea Change - what's up with this?? Considering a return."
5,beck puts out more than expected,"being a huge beck fan, i was amazed at how much he exceded my expectations. his tracks masterfully weave a funky mix of hip hop, mariachi, and alternative rock into a amazing cd. my favorite tracks aree-proque onda gueromissinga must buy!"
2,A DUD...,"After a promising opening track (E-Pro) this cd plods on and on to it's disappointing conclusion aptly titled ""Emergency Exit"". Only for Beck devotees.Robby"
3,Handful of Catchy Tunes,"Guero is neither over nor underwhelming. There are a sufficient number of decent tracks, but few that stand out as classics. For another artist, this would be a solid outing. For Beck, it's one of his more forgettable titles. You're best off picking a few tracks off this album and moving on."
3,Somewhere between stale and fresh,"Although still more than a competent purveyor for his skewed take on pop-rock-insert genre here, it has become clear over the years that Beck has lost some of his luster when it simply comes to presenting music with urgency. Settled down on a more familiar palate, the once total unpredictability inherent with this musical misfit is all but set on its beat-driven, retro-futurism course, but it is still a ride mainly worth taking."
5,YOU PEOPLE ARE MORONS!,"This CD is really fun to listen to. Now, Beck never wanted to be understood. Stop ananlyzing every detail and just play it. I thought that this disc had real cool beats and well crafted songs. Are you gonna bash him cuz it comes easy?I say, the more the merrier. If a song happens to sound similar to something else, well that is the breaks. Since I was digging BECK before he was a pop phenomenon I can honestly say that if ODELAY had never been produced, it wouldn't matter. Not that I don't like it, its just that everytime a new BECK album comes out it gets compared to that one. I'm gonna make you arseheads stay locked in a closet and audiofeed you STEREPHONIC SOULMANURE until y'all get right.Meanwhile I hope BECK keeps releasing mediocre album after mediocre album with a huge smile on his face cuz' they are all gonna be awesome!"
5,Another triumph,I'm a big Beck fan. I don't know how anyone can listen to his albums and not honestly become a fan...it baffles me.Guero is simply a fun Beck romp that deserves a listen. It is ideal for putting on your portable mp3 player and walking downtown. Just be careful that you don't start strutting around and breakdancing or anything.
5,Love this CD!,"I have been a Beck fan from the beginning. To keep it short & simple - This is by far his best album, a must have."
2,A step down...,"You'd of hoped Sea Change, the first sincere album of his whole career, might of informed the rest of Beck's output with less wink-wink irony or self conscious, ""clever"" musical textures.But those hopes would have been in vain. The whole album has a tired and dated, electronically informed sound that only reminds you he'd done all of this before years ago.I didn't find anything offensively miserable, as the whole album sort of grooves along absently. You actually sort of forget you were even listening in the first place after a while. (like the earlier reviewer said) I'm sure we'll begin to see any number of these lazy productions gracing the soundtrack of some car or hipster clothes commercial."
3,buy sea change,"guero is like a bunt instead of a homerun, it's not that it's a bad album it's just all done before and much better on odelay and mutations. There is one exception, ""Hell Yes"" is a great song and would have fit in nicely on midnight vultures. I still think beck's best album is sea change even though it his most depressing, it's much better than guero."
3,A nice mixed tape,"Wow! Is this a 70's record? That's my first thought during the first opening bars of ""E-Pro"", the campy na-na-na chorus makes this a footstomping rocksong with vamp, like Primal Scream.Track 2 on the mixtape is by Cypress Hill, including a bassline that just floats somewhere in the middle of the albumTrack 3 is an European song, probably from Sweden. At least, that's how it sounds in the beginning before it turns into an eels-song.Then it's off for some easy-tune music on ""Missing"", which could also be a Verve song.And so it continues for the rest of the albumBeck is a master-sampler. Not by taking parts of other songs, but by quoting a lot of different styles of music.Does it make for a good album? Well, in the Beck universe this album will not be seen as his greatest when we look at it again in 10 years. It doesn't have the great inventiveness of 'Mellow Gold' or the overal quality of 'Odelay'. It's certainly not bad, but not super"
2,the location was the best part,"Palo Alto is a cool place to visit. Old money abounds, so things tend to be nice. This story could have taken place anywhere. Boys want girls, get girls, learn something before the night is over. Perhaps there were a couple of more meaningful epiphanies, but how can we be sure with a story that covers these characters for a mere 12 hours?"
5,Great Value!,I was very pleased with the Amethyst Bracelet. The color of the stones was excellent and I thought that the value for money was exceptional.
4,very nice quality for the money,"I got this for my fiance for christmas. Overall, I am very pleased with it. The garnets are very nice, very good quality. The diamonds are small, as you would expect, but the setting for the diamonds make them seem very much larger. I would expect to pay, realistically, around an actual $350-450 for this in a jewelry store, so it was a great value for the money. I would buy this again for her in a second. Also, the box that it came in was very gorgeous, and helped make this gift even nicer."
2,"Disappointing - Weak content, only 3 chapters on OSPF","After viewing the beta version of this book, I was very disappointed with the content - it's hardly what I expect from a book of this title.The discussions on ""designing and implementing OSPF"" is basic stuff, not ""expert"" level. In fact only 3 of the 13 chapters even focus on OSPF - the remaining 10 chapters discuss other routing protocols and the usual introductory stuff.If you're only trying to pass the CCIE, then this book will probably help. If you're looking for a real book about OSPF, this isn't it. Cisco has great OSPF references on its web site, and John Moy's OSPF book has far more detail than this one."
2,"If you want an in-depth OSPF book, do NOT get this.","This book is a nice reference to get a general overview of various routing protocols, but I don't know how it made it past the publisher with that title. I was expecting to get a very detailed OSPF book, but instead you only get a few chapters actually covering the protocol listed on the cover of this book."
5,Yay!!!!!!!!!!,Thanks for sending my DVD's so quickly and thanks for the REALLY good price!You're the best and I'll be ordering form you again in the future!Deb Self
3,Nothing special...needs more heroin addiction,"This album gets 3 1/2 stars. It's really not bad, and I wouldn't hold it against someone I had recently met and had smoked up with if they put it on at their house. Especially if they had some good finger food too, like grilled eggplant chips or guacamole fritters. Is that a real thing? Oh man, tomorrow I'm going to go get a girlfriend so she'll make those for me. I wonder if she'll be on her period. Some girls have sex on their period if the guy's down, and believe me, I'm downtown if you know what I mean, but they probably won't want to do it for the first time. She better have big jugs to hold me over.In conclusion, Waterloo blah blah is decent, but neither special nor original, and unfortunately just got deleted from my iTunes while I was looking for porn I hid in there."
4,Eagerly awaited album does not disappoint!,"All the hoopla caused by Pete Doherty serves as a distraction as Carl Barat comes up with a solid winner with the rest of the ex-Libertines members. Loads better than Babyshambles, with clear, distinctive hooks and catchy lyrics. This is one album that should be played LOUD!"
4,Good book. Microsoft seems a bit clueless.,"This was a good book for those interested in Microsofts entry into the game console market. I thought it was well written and easy to get through. It helped me understand how Micrsoft does things, and it is not a pretty picture. After reading the book, I was left with the impression that Microsoft is spending billions of dollars to get into an industry that it really knows little about. Further, it was lead into this pursuit by a team of people who hadn't been with the company all that long, and while they seem hyper competitive and smart, they really didn't know what they were doing either. Sometimes it is easy to believe that a company with Microsoft's track record is invincible when it decides to enter a market, but this book disabused me of that notion."
2,Does the Job...but leaves its mark!,"Yes this is a functional ipod armband - actually stays put, as opposed to other ipod armbands made for the larger ipod models. But...the ""protective cover"" for the screen left some serious scratches on my screen & wheel!!!"
4,fun for kids..dont dishwash,good project for the kids..they love crafts and things like this..this packages it all in one for a rainy or cold day...
3,Repeated Mistakes in Plate Creation,"I bought this product as the activity at my daughter's birthday party. The kids created their artwork and I filled out the forms, including the text to print on the plates' rims, and sent them all in myself. The company made mistakes on at least 1/2 of the plates, including my daugther's. When I returned hers, the company repeated the mistake. Then I gave up."
4,"Nice Mag, Irritating policy","I really like the quality of this magazine, or I wouldn't have subscribed.It is irritating, however, when the first two issues you receive arrive on the same day, and both are ones you've already purchased at the newstand. I mean really. Why would you send out the previous month's issue?"
2,"Prettypictures, content no value!","This magazine is outdated. It lacks value in that content , graphics and editorial direction is buried in the l980's. Unlimiting growth with a diffent approach but currently doomed to its own demise."
4,Beautiful homes,I really like Veranda for the beautiful homes they showcase. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because while it is so much fun to look at all the beauty not everyone has such grand homes. I did get some good decorating ideas from the magazine but just not practical for my lifestyle.
1,Bad design,Why does the IR receiver have to block the memory port? I want a remote that leaves both memory card ports unblocked. That way I can use a memory card and a gameshark at the same time. Unplugging the IR receiver to use both is stupid. At least Interact is using their brains. Now maybe someone can design a remote controller that plugs into the USB jack and leaves the other ports alone.
2,Doesn't help,"From what I hear, this is the best remote on the market. But that is not true. I have found that the PS2 joystick works the best. Because the PS2 requires you to hold down the button to search through a movie the remote is ineffective. It is only good for pushing play and stop. The signal always breaks so you can't search. Also it is difficult to select a frame. I guess if you really need a remote this is the one to get from what I hear, but if I was you I would just use your joystick until something better comes out on the market."
1,Sucks,"This remote isn't even worth one star. After ""using"" it a few times (not well) it just ceased working. Now I have useless pieces of plastic sitting around. This is so not worth your .....not for a pile of garbage.I rather use my controller to watch DVD's."
1,Functions assigned to wrong keys,"I don't know if I got a defective unit, but the key assigned to confirm actually transmits the stop function and vice versa. Once you understand this, you can make it work, but it is annoying."
1,Wait for the Interact remote,I tested both the Interact and Saitek remote. I would recommand holding off purchasing this piece of junk and wait for Interact remote which should be fixed shortly it already worked fine except for the switched buttons.
1,Saitek dvd remote... dont buy,"I bought this thing and tried it. It doesn't work very well, and the response is slow. Trust me dont buy it. Wait for the Sony Remote. I think it comes out this fall."
2,Saitek disappointment,"Lack of controls such as 4x and 8x reverse and forward scan and slow are disappointing. I'm not sure this is Saitek's fault, but it certainly dulled my first PS2/DVD watching experience. Otherwise the product is fine for setup, usability, and range."
2,Get the sony,"It works, but why spend about the same for a remote with so few functions when you can get the better sony for approximately the same cost? I bought this one in a pinch at Best Buy, they were out of the sony's and I needed the remote that day. Given the choice (though I haven't used it) the Sony looks very appealing."
3,"Flimsy remote, but does a decent job","I chose this controller mostly because it didn't block any of the PS2's ports (USB, Firewire, controllers, memory cards) and was competitively priced. I've found the big problem other people have been having. The remote is extremely flimsy (it weighs virtually nothing) and the buttons are quite unresponsive. It does the job though, and I've had no problems getting the signal through from a fair range. Unfortunately, sometimes controller cables get in the way and block the receiver, and it would be nice if that could be avoided (it's even worse when the PS2 is in a vertical stand) but that's not really Saitek's fault. Overall, a very average product."
4,E.K. Review,"Bull Run is cleverly themed on the first major battle of the Civil War, in which there are 16 characters, 8 Southerners and 8 Northerners whose lives intersect during a key point in our nations history. Their stories alternate through out the book, so it is very tempting to skip ahead. It is an educational, and historical fiction novel. I recommend this book for anyone Junior High School and up.It was a phenomenal book, but lacking some information on the characters backgrounds. It would be a little easier to understand if you use a character sketch to organize your thoughts. Other than that, it was a fantastic book that will wrap you up in it's stories and will be hard to put down."
5,Solid and clear filter,"It's a excellent filter that fitted well and protected my Canon lens. It had a solid feel, and it didn't interfere or alter the images at all. Good price and does what it's supposed to do."
4,Neat product!,This puzzle conserver is a must have for any puzzle enthusiest! My 9 year old daughter loves to do puzzles and was very excited when I showed her this. It is easy to use and dries quickly. What a great way to keep your hard work preserved!
3,Nice Intro But Lacked Depth and Sources,"Reading this book made me wish I had read it before I read Ahmed Rashid's book, Taliban. It puts many issues in focus, giving the reader a basic starting point for further research, but that is all it really does. His bibliography was limited to 13 book resources and the text is scattered with clips from Taliban radio but it doesn't really ""break out the box"" per se, giving no real indepth viewpoints any more than a school textbook. And it is much related to a school textbook because those book sources seem mostly to be secondary sources. He mentions Osama Bin Laden in only one paragraph and never at all speaks of Al Qaeda forces.But in the conclusion he mentions the purpose of his book being to rid people of stereotypes about Islamic movements and to show the conflict in communication between Islam and the West. In the case of the former, he pretty much succeeds. In the later, I'd read Rashid for a better anwer than Marsden."
2,JUST A TOY.,"CHEAP BUILT QUALITY.,CHEESY IMAGE WITH BAD VIDEO QUALITY.HUGE CHARGER CABLE.WORSE THAN VHS QUALITY.VERY PORTABLE.,BUT GET A GOOD POUCH TO PROTECT ITS FRAGILITY."
3,Good coverage of the scientific study but with an agenda.,Nickell gives a entertaining and compleet history of the scientific inquery of 1978 into the Shroud of Turin. He occasionaly gets bogged down in scientific jargen but is very conciously writing for a popular audience. He dedicates a large part of the book to his research (and debunking his adversaries) and this can be tedious at times. All in all it is an interesting and informative book for the scientificly minded person who is interested in the Shroud of Turin.
5,Excellent teaching tool,"I ordered these cards (2 sets) to teach the power of concentration. The students matched the cards and learned affirmations at the same time. These cards were used to teach others but are also useful to affirm what is the Truth about an individual. If you like playing cards, order the Wisdom cards and instill positive affirmations in your mind as you have fun."
2,Wisdom Cards,"These arrived on time, but were not as I anticipated. They were too ""flashy"" and did not seem to be well done for the subject matter. I was disappointed."
2,this is the book you have to use in california to do disability,"This book requires that you attend several seminars, buy several other books explainig how to use the charts, what theintent of the book was vs what you have to do to make things work. If you do diability work in California, buy this book."
3,Not as helpful as other ORA books,"I bought this books because of the usefulness of other ORA I've bought. This one just wasn't as good. When the book contained the information I was looking for, it was presented well and very helpful (assuming I could find it). But I found the index to be incomplete making it difficult to find many topics, and many other common features which I would have found useful were left out all together. This is more or less adequate, especially for a beginning programmer, but I'm sure there's a better book out there."
3,The King is a very lonely man.,"I have recently finished reading this book and it is quite a chore. Not only are the chapters rather long, but they contain so much information that they take a while to read.This book paints an acid portrait of Jerry Lewis. On the one hand, his childhood was not a happy one and I felt sorry for him. On the other hand, Jerry seems to feel that the world owes him a living. The book is rife with (what I believe to be) direct quotes from Jerry, and these quotes can be very nasty very often. If you LOVE Jerry Lewis, you may want to avoid this book because it depicts him as a very difficult & argumentative individual; this book may make you lose respect for him. On a gossipy Hollywood Babylon-type level, the book succeeds brilliantly."
3,Yes and no,"On the one hand, this was immensely readable. On the other hand, the negative things Levy has to say turn out to be for personal reasons. You have to wait for the afterword at the back of the book to find out that he and Lewis didn't see eye to eye and Levy felt hurt by this. Hence, the dirt. It's the Mommie Dearest Syndrome. Christina Crawford, we learn when we read that book, actually had made up with and was very close to her mother at the time of Joan Crawford's death. Then, inexplicably, Crawford left Christina out of her will. Hence, the dirt. So if Levy had (a) just skipped the afterword altogether, (b) put it up front as a preface so we could go into the book knowing the motivation, or (c) eased up on some of the vitriol, it would have been a better book. I'll read more books on Lewis, but I won't be reading anything else by Levy."
5,"Informative, well organized guide to hardware","This book covers virtually every aspect of PC Hardware, for both AMD and Intel based PC systems. The Thompsons continue to update the information to stay current with the latest hardware available as well as throroughly covering older systems. It also includes entire sections on both upgrading your PC (and evaluating what/when to upgrade) and building your new PC from scratch."
5,pc hardware in a nutshell 2nd edition,Loved this book.All the detailed questions I had about computer hardware were answered in this book. Easy to understand.Up to date info.
1,Just a name like always...,"Between this and my 26.00 Phillips HDMI, I did not notice any difference whatsoever. Save your moola for something else."
1,The only benefit of this cable is that you can laugh at those who buy it (just as long as it's not you),"A friend of mine works at a large electronics retailer, and has a love-affair with Monster cables. In all fairness he praises their power filters and their surge protectors more than their actual cables--however when he purchased a new Blu-Ray player he got this Monster HDMI cable ""to make the most of HD.""I couldn't help but do a switcharoo and give him my $6 eBay HDMI and borrow his Monster. I was unable to notice any difference, and waited to see if he would. The night before I made the swap he was showing of Ratatouille almost frame-by-frame, and the next day he was doing it again--oblivious to the swap.After giving him back his cable (and watching him swap the two back and forth looking for any difference) he made the decision to return the Monster (and ordered a $6 eBay cable).To clarify, there was absolutely no noticeable benefit for paying 1000% the price."
1,RIP-OFF!,Shame on this company for gouging consumers. You can get the very same quality cable for 10% of the price.Then you can take the $90 you saved and spend it on something useful ... like going to see Wild Hogs 9x -- starring the wildly untalented John Travolta and the never been less funny Tim Allen.
5,This is Art,"This is one of the few TV shows I've seen, if not the only TV show, that truly rises to the level of great art. Like a great novel, The Wire asks a lot of its audience. If you put in the time and watch every episode you will be rewarded immensely. This show will take you into the lives of its compelling, well written characters, where you will experience the range of emotions from hope, frustration, guilt, anger, sadness, and everything in between. To call this series a ""cop show set in Baltimore"" misses the point entirely. It is a show about people, their foibles and imperfections, and the way they behave in different environments and circumstances, set against the backdrop of crime, poverty and politics in the modern US city."
4,Well Done,Well done but didn't live up to all the hype for me. I am curious to watch a few more episodes to see what develops.
5,First of all...,"I just bought all three seasons for $40. People need to learn how to shop....Secondly, I've only watched 2 1/2 episodes of the show and I'm ADDICTED!!! Seriously. This show is superb. I had been looking for OZ, or NY Undercover (if anyone remembers that show) and I came across this. I spend all of my free time watching it (which isnt much considering it takes 2 days to watch one episode) but what I have seen of it is incredible. I dont think I'd buy it for the retail price, but if you can borrow someones or find a reduced price (as I did) then I'd encourage anyone to buy it. Its good."
1,Buy anything else,"I really disliked this show, i watched the entire first season in two days, i only did so because i was waiting for it to become interesting. After so many glowing reviews, i could not belive how just plain awful this show turned out to be. I would rather watch reruns of Barney Miller, you get the same effect of watching the Wire except with slightly more enjoyment. I know it's not The Shield and it's not supposed to be but i implore you to purchase that series if you want to enjoy a television experience."
5,The Wire,"Excellent production values, casting, acting, editing, scripting, lighting, cinematography, directing, all combine to make this one of the best of it's genre that I've experienced. This is second time I've seen it and appreciate it even more than the first"
5,Great TV drama,"One of the best TV drama's ever, and definitely the best ""cop"" show around. Since this show's inception I've worked at 2 different law enforcement agencies. The cops there keep telling me that ""The Wire"" shows policing like it really it. The good, the bad, and the ugly.....This is a great show. Enjoy!"
5,"""Cheese puffs AND f***** ring dings?""","The Wire typifies ""slow boil."" Early on you wonder what the heck is this thing? But it sneaks up on you, and weaves its tale in a way few other ""dramas"" on TV can.There were similiar shows on TV, in the mold of carefully setting up its characters slowly. These shows went by the names of LOST and the Sopranos. The main differences here aren't that one took place on an island or in restaurants and the other on the streets. The main difference, is The Wire knew what the heck it was doing.Screw cop shows and CSI reruns. Invest your time here. Season 1 is just the beginning."
2,The Wire,Did we see Hill Street Blues many years ago? Gritty city and personal stories of the characters. When did this become new?
2,not the same wire i knew,"Greetings fellow amazonians I picked this up because I thought it was the documenry about a famous family tightrope walkers. Instead this is a gritty drama about everyday life in baltimore. Why do I care about that? Just because everybody there grows up to be a dope dealer or a pimp doesn't mean I should waste my time watching it. Quite honestly this show is no more inspiring than leave it to beaver was in the 1950's. Amazon please bring back the correct ""wire"" so I can enjoy the great tightrope action rather than this mindless drivel."
3,"""The iMac Book Not For Everyone""","If you bought the iMac Book expecting to find a little more on the ""how the iMac works"" type of information, you might be a little disappointed. This stuff is dealt with briefly, but most of the book is focused on getting on-line and what to do once you're there. And that's fair enough-after all that's what the iMac is all about.The iMac Book is an excellent reference work for using your iMac on-line. But if it's more technical stuff you need on how your little coloured beastie works, then iMacs for Dummies is probably a better buy."
5,Top of their Genre.,This is a group that has obviously been making music together for a long time. Tight performances on all instruments and the female voices are exquisite. The Mud Flaps are at the top of their genre.
4,I love it,"I just like Omarion in general, so me reading the book was a given. butit really let me see what his life was about, a lot of things happened in his life that i never would have expected, but overall, it was a pretty good book to me."
5,A Beautiful Slice of Life!,"Disregard the other poor reviews of this film. Such reviews are like having a redneck critique Rembrandt. This film has a beautiful, breazy look and feel about it. The camera draws you in to a lifelike and gorgeous rambling vacation or holiday that leaves you sad, let fulfilled. This is an art house film. It is subtle, yet bold. Daring in its camera work and sublime in its portrayal of the actors. With this film, you can be transported into what seems like a lifelike journey with the actors as they experience life on this most beautiful of journeys. This is not a skin flick, THANKFULLY! This is art. A film for those wishing to view a special picture for the sake of its art and visual imagery. Taste it like wine. Own this film. Don't rent it."
1,Not a drama either,"My husband rented it because the skin caught his eye, and when he read the back cover, he thought i'd talked about it before. Well, seeing that it won an award for cinematography, i didnt think i'd like it. It was BORING! I almost turned it off before it was done, but hoped the ending would be interesting. It wasnt. Long, boring, no story, just people hanging out doing stupid things and wishing they were doing something else. Let me be clear here -- i prefer alternative films. I didnt like this one."
4,Tan Lines,"very well done, the story took a left turn at the end, but was good.excellent talent by leading actors, hope to see more of them fromother australian products when they become available"
5,A great beginners guide to learning the religion of Buddism,This is a great book if you want to learn about Buddism. I am a beginner Buddist and I found this book particularly incisive in learning Buddism. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn more about the Buddist religion. I would also recommend this book to anyone who feels that they need a change for the better in their life and for anyone who is looking for spiritual understanding.
1,Does not help to understand Buddhism,"Althought the second part of the title of the book is "" The Buddhist way to happiness"" the book is completelly devoted to the author's life and experience. Unfortunately, sharing her stories, did not help me in my path to happiness. Maybe the book should focus a little bit more on the basic teachings of Buddha."
5,Essence of applied Buddhism.,"Sylvia Boorstein is a teacher of meditation with at least 30 years experience. She is regularly invited all over the world to lead retreats and to give seminars. It's Easier Than You Think is a collection of brief essays in which she shows, using examples from her own life experiences, how to apply Buddhist techniques and principles. This little book is clear, down to earth and amusing. It will, above all, be appreciated by those who have been overwhelmed by Buddhist terminology. Here they will findthe essence of Buddhism presented in a way that anyone can understand, appreciate and apply."
3,This book is NOT what it says!,"The book is a good technical reference for TCP/IP but NOT for windows 2000 TCP/IP. By it's title I think one would expect that the book explains about the implementation of TCP/IP in win2k i.e the data staructures used, the way buffers managed etc. BUT this book is nothing but almost RFCs rewritten! , one can as well read RFCs which are available for free or there are 1000 other well written books for protocols. To summerize, the ""microsoft windows 2000"" on the top of the books title is irrelevent and misleading the buyer."
2,Shallow treatment - next to nothing on MS protocols,"This is supposed to be a TECHNICAL reference on MICROSOFT tcp/ip, but there is almost nothing on netbios over tcp (the SMB/CIFS layers that MS uses). There are plenty of tcp/ip books out there- the only purpose this one could have is to document MS additions to, and usage of, tcp/ip, and it's very disappointing. Nothing deeper than the OS help file.I didn't read the material on standard tcp/ip, because I didn't need it. I imagine it handles that just fine."
4,"Beautiful fragrance, but with a disappearing scent","I loved Dolce & Gabbana's Light Blue perfume from the first sniff. Light and airy, slightly floral, this is a fun fragrance for daytime use and casual nights. The only problem is that the scent totally disappears after a couple of hours. I definitely recommend this product, but would suggest keeping it in your purse for touch up spritzes throughout the day."
2,No Mastering found Here,"This book came in a set. Like most Sybex books this book is easy to read, however considering all of the possibilities available to the author of a Windows 2000 book, this one falls short its potential.Significantly lacking in any real world advice though the general coverage of Active Directory is okay, the book doesn't provide nearly enough information about details. In addition, because the book is older it doesn't include a lot of information about enhancments and new utilities.There's not enough meaty technical information here to make this a good exam study guide. On the other hand, it may be somewhat valuable to someone who is new to Active Directory and specfically to directory services in general."
3,Content - 5 stars; style - 1 star,"This is a difficult book to review. On the one hand, it has many sections that are deeply insightful and useful. On the other hand, at times I found the author's writing style to be paternalistic and self-aggrandizing. He seems deeply impressed with himself and his accomplishments. The book is also repetitive in places, although I believe that may be intentional, to drive home his points about safety and trusting your instincts. However, the chapter on how men and women differ in their perceptions of danger was worth the cost of the book - it gave me a way to explain to my husband why women are fearful in situations where men would not be. His comment that, at the core, men are afraid women will laugh at them, and women are afraid men will kill them, was profound. So do I recommend this book? Yes, because it deals with an important and neglected topic in a new way. But be prepared to annoyed at the author's writing stye."
5,Puts the mind at ease. A great self help resource for those recovering from abuse and violence in its various forms,"I can say most of the things in this book just make sense. I wish I read it a long time ago, and i could have spared me a lot of frustration in my relationships with people. Especially the abusive and controlling relationship I left. It is also helpful to know some red flags to look for to keep me from making the same mistake again. Don't ignore your suspicions of someone. Looks for the danger signs before they become a reality in your life."
5,The Gift of Fear,"I purchased the audio taped version of this book and thoroughly enjoyed it. De Becker uses unfortunate, yet eye opening situations that he has dealt with in his life to help better explain our natural tool of fear and how to better use it. De Becker is the narrator and speaks very clearly, distinctly and uses layman's language. I recommend this book for anyone that wishes to better distinguish paranoia from fear and possibly save their life because of it."
4,A dose of necessary realism and practical wisdom. Information that could save your life.,"I think just the fact that this book has over 325 high reviews by a wide of variety of people including law enforcement, psychologists, etc., speaks more loudly than anything I could write here. However, I would like to add my two cents that it is a book with information that could literally save your life. It is interesting, engaging and full of real life stories. A complimentary book for those that are dating isSafe People: How to Find Relationships That Are Good for You and Avoid Those That Aren't. This book has broad-based appeal and something for everyone. In places it gets repetitious, but that is a minor point."
3,MOSTLY INFOMERCIAL,"Rory Miller recommended THE GIFT OF FEAR so I bought a copy. It reminds me of a very long infomercial.It has some good information in it, to be sure, but the info is buried in the self-promoting blabber."
5,BUY IT-READ IT-DO IT,"This is an excellent text outlining the psychological aspect of self-defense. DeBecker writes with apparent authority on the subject and the books use of several case studies truly help the reader understand what type of mind one is dealing with in a self-defense situation against these sick minded whack jobs. I recommend the book to all my students of self-defense, regardless of their gender or age. Further, I suggest that my martial art and police students read it. The book serves as a great foundation of knowledge for those sincerely interested in self-defense and self-reliance. The pre-attack indicators are an excellent tool for avoiding and attempting to prevent personal danger. This book along with some good physical techniques of self-defense should be mandatory for all teenage girls prior to leaving home for college or work. For those of you who are serious about self-reliance and self-protection may I refer you to my ""Listmania"" suggestions."
5,Get on the upside of dealing with dark human behavior,"This book is a bit different from what I normally read. The author describes how to trust our fear signals and instincts in different situations that can come up in daily life. He deals with stalking, analyzing personalities, work environment, personal relations, and overall how to manage fear. The cases in the book are highly interested and scary at the same time. Being from Europe the scenes seems a bit alien at first but are actually very similar to what goes on over here to. This book serves as great tool on how to judge situations and when and how to take action and not. The incredible thing is that we've all got the fear instinct in us, and learning how to use it properly can do so much for each person. Highly Recommended!"
5,Survival Signals,This is a must read for every woman. It is very detailed & shows us how to follow our own instincts for safety.
5,Full of important and useful information.,"When I read this type of book I have a habit of underscoring information I want to read again. When I finished the Gift of Fear, almost every page had something underscored. There is so much useful and important information I am sharing the book with my family and purchasing the taped copy for my busy daughter. The Gift of Fear is #1 in my house."
5,A BOOK FOR EVERY WOMAN TO READ,"I FIRS SAW THE AUTHOR ON OPRAH'S SHOW. I THEN CHECKED THE BOOK OUT AT THE LIBRARY. AFTER JUST READING A FEW PAGES I KNEW I WANTED IT FOR MYSELF. I ORDERED IT AND GOT THE CD'S, BUT I STILL WANT THE BOOK. I ALSO ORDERED ""PROTECTING THE GIFT"" KEEPING CHILDREN AND TEENAGERS SAFE (AND PARENTS SANE) BY THE SAME AUTHOR. IT STATES ON THE COVER, 1.SAFETY SKILLS FOR CHILDREN OUTSIDE THE HOME 2. WARNING SIGNS OF SEXUAL ABUSE 3. HOW TO SCREEN BABY-SITTERSAND CHOOSE SCHOOLS 4. STRATEGIES FOR KEEPING TEENAGERS FROM VIOLENCE. CAN'T WAIT TO FINISH READING IT."
5,Must have for serious self defense and martial artists,"This is a book that teaches you that your greatest weapon for self-defense is your own intuition. Unfortunately, due to the way our modern society have influenced our upbringing, our intuition is not what it should be. We are more laxed and we frequently push our own doubts and fears to the back of our mind using our own personal 'logic'. This has resulted in putting ourselves into more risky situation which we could have avoided.The book has certainly opened my mind on the subject of threat assessments and how we view our lives. It's not a book that should leave you being scared everyday of your life, nor will it make you over confident.What it does do is that it will make you more aware of your environment, on how to handle threats to your safety and to ultimately live a happier and safer life.If you're a martial artist, then this book should have been on your bookshelf already!"
4,"a good read, especially for women","The human body has evolved over millions of years to instinctively detect danger. Your body will likely detect danger before your mind does. And when it does, it triggers automatic physiological responses.We've all heard the truism ""Be aware of your surroundings."" This book goes into great detail explaining how and what to look for, and how to listen to your instincts. There are many subtleties to watch for.This book can save your life."
5,I've bought more copies of this book than any other,"I keep buying this book over and over again because I keep giving my copies away. Any and all of my loved ones and friends now have copies as well...because it is nearly necessary in today's society.But plenty of people have focused on that protective side of the book...there is another aspect I'd like to mention. As a man, I can scarcely conceive of what it's like to be a woman in today's society. This book didn't make me a guru, but it certainly gave me perspective on the difference... about how a situation which would seem neutral or even friendly to a man would seem fearful and threatening to a woman. This is not a statement about women being weak or men being jerks...it's about acknowledging and trying to understand that the world is both a more beautiful and more horrible place than we can even imagine."
4,a gift indeed,"Haven't finished this yet, but Gavin is a professional in writing and experience. His every advice tells you to trust yourself and what you believe in at gut level. If you aren't able to trust yourself, he teaches you how to. Because the world, even locally, has gotten so unstable, I wanted to know and do my best for those most precious to me in every circumstance we might encounter."
4,"Simple, yet informative","Simple read, but very informative. Boils down to trust your instincts. Frightening how ofter we are inclined to over-ride that internal alarm."
3,Worth the read,"The first chapter had me hooked. if you can get through the rest without giving up you'll think the book was worth it. What I mean is he's very long winded and to tell you the truth I could give two hoots abouts politicians I really just wanted to know how best to protect my daughter and to give her the skills she needs to protect herself and listen to her gut instinct. The first chapters, somewhere in the middle and the end did this, and for this reason only I'm rating it OKAY"
5,Help yourself...,"We, as a culture, have never been more violent. That fact alone in bad enough. What makes it horrendous is that the majority of us, while posessing the natural gift of intuition that serves to protect us from harm, have disengaged it. We have shut off our danger-meter. De Becker's ""The gift of fear"" is a practical means of helping to re-educate the public about the many hidden dangers in the world, while dispelling myths about the true nature of the survival mechanism fear. I came away from reading this feeling at least five times safer and more confident than I did before reading it. Give it a whirl. We can all use a little more safety in this world."
1,Not much more than common sense,"If you're looking for practical advice, this is not the book for you. It's packed with repetitive, obvious stories. Let me summarize this book for you- Ladies, if a guy is weird, or abusive, or strikes fear in you, don't go out with him. Be alert, and call the cops if you see him anywhere he shouldn't be after that.If you want something you can really use, which can help you defuse bad situations, you might want to check out a booked called Verbal Judo, which while aimed at police use a bit too much, has a lot of practical advice."
5,Another wonderful book from Robert Olen Butler,"The author of the beautiful Pulitzer-winning ""Good Scent from a Strange Mountain"" sends his readers on another incredible journey with ""Mr. Spaceman."" Not afraid to tread new ground by taking his literary voice into the science fiction genre, Robert Olen Butler has written the perfect novel for the new millenium. ""Mr. Spaceman"" is deeply satisfying -- funny, moving and always surprising. I couldn't put it down and felt a huge sense of loss when I finished reading. A slim book, it speaks volumes about our commercialized society, about dreams, about families, about religion and about love. This is a unique and very funny voice, writing at his best. Mr. Spaceman will stay with you for a long time."
2,Spaced Out,The first strike against this book is the fact the jacket refers to it as 'humurous'. Do not be fooled! There are any number of funny situations in this book but the narration bleeds any and all humor out of them. It is almost as if two different people plotted and wrote the book. Now it IS very well written but a person approaching this book should expect a deadly serious peek into the minds of a wide variety of characters and nary a chuckle. Do not make the mistake I did and expect a 'humorous' book. The other problems I found were the bibical allegory near the end and the total cop out of an ending to the book.All in all I can reccommend this book but not if the reader wants some literary fun or will be operating heavy machinery soon after reading it.
3,Vibrant Colors,This was a cute book. It is not one of my favorite but it had bright colors and fun animal pictures. It seems like they spent all of their time on the illustrations and slapped together the words of the story as an after thought. It is a fun book to pet but a bland book to read.
4,Big improvement,"After complaining for months that I needed to replace my old Norelco electric shaver, my wife bought me the Braun 8985 as a Father's Day gift. Talk about a big improvement - I find that where the Norelco always irritated the skin on my neck, the Braun is much more gentle. I can press down very firmly and still not get the red irritated spots that I used to get before. The razor feels very comfortable in my hand, and although the cleaning stand is somewhat bulky, I really like being able to just drop the shaver in and have it clean the next time I come back. I would definitely recommend this razor."
2,Close shave,Beware of the warranty on Braun shavers. They say try them for 3 or 4 weeks. When you call to say that they don't work for you. You are told there is a 30 day warranty. So no return option after 30 days.
1,"Shaver OK, Base problems","Shaver does a good job, but the cleaning base/charger is failing after less than one year. Called Cust Service, was told had to send to repair facility; none in our state. Means a long time without the razor. Asked to speak with Cust Service Mgr, was told would get same answer. Another non-caring vendor,no more Braun products for me."
2,Problem,"Excellent shave. However, I continue to experience a problem with the shaver each time I try to release it from it's pod after it has gone through it's cleaning cycle. It just will not release the shaver unless I pull the electrical contact from the socket. I hate to go thru the trouble, but it looks like I 'll have to send the damn thing back."
4,Best electric shaver I've ever owned.,"First of all, it shaves very well -- not QUITE blade close, but it doesn't me bleed or irritate my skin, either. I like the cleaner. The trimmer can handle the longer hairs that can get away from an electric; no problems around my chin and nose (where some electrics don't get it done). High grades!"
5,Worth Every Penny!,"I am a sufferer of sensitive skin... particularly right above the neckline. I have tried every possible combination of shaving with a blade and several electric razors. This by far is the best I have used to date. Don't get me wrong it's not cheap and there is a need for steady supply of cleaning solutions and replacement blades to keep your razor at top performance, however, it has been worth every penny.I don't want you to walk away with the impression that this shaver is the only part of the solution... absolutely not. I still use a shaving lubricant and when I have finished shaving I have to immediately spray my face with an antimicrobial (any type of first aid spray). But this combination has been a winner for me. No longer does shaving have to be a painful ordeal and I don't walk around looking like I have a bad case of hives."
4,A day behind Mach 3,"If you want a convenience of the electric shaver, you should definitely look into the Braun line. It is good and solid product, which is very easy to use. It shaves clean and fast. It is the right size and weight. Holds the charge enough for a small trip.The only side effects are:- you have to get used to the foil. I've been using mine for more then a month and it still burns the skin after you are done. (opposite to the razor which might hurt a little when you shave, but completely cool afterwords)- charging/cleaning base is big and somewhat useless. I think simply corded model would be the smarter buy.- not as good as Gillette Mach 3. With Braun I have to shave every day, period. With Mach 3 razor I can usually skip a day without any problems."
4,Still uncertain,"This is the first electric I have used. I like the way feels and it does a fair job of shaving though from what I read I have to give it a month to be really efficient, which I think means that my whiskers have to reorint their gorwth direction to comply with the shaving blade. So the final opinion is out."
3,little improvement,"Switching from a 10 year old Panasonic electric razor to a state-of-the-art Braun shaver, gave me every expectation of a quicker and closer shave. Neither has happened, and I find the sideburn trimmer so badly placed that it is impossible to use for any purpose."
1,The worst buy,I caustion everyone to buy such product. Everything it claims is not true.The rotary Shavers are much much better in my opinion. The worst thing is that the foil breaks every two months when you use the self cleaning. So why do we pay that much for something that not only does what claims but also requires replacement due to its own fault.
5,September Song,"I just wanted to drop you a note to say how much I enjoy your music. Thanks for sharing it with the world. It's stirring and peaceful at the same time. I enjoy ""September Song"" and ""I Will Not Be Destroyed"" and all of the songs on the CD, but I think my favorite song is ""I Need Your Breath On Me."""
4,Great Book for anyone architecting a Domino network,"I've purchased 3 copies for my team to give them a production environment perspective.James Grigsby, Iris Performance Team Leader, Developers of Lotus Notes/Domino"
4,"Very good book, but contains some errors","This book was very helpful to me because does not waste time on obvious things. It is dense and to the point.However, it contains some errors, especially the last chapter."
2,I wasted my time on this book.,"I bought 3 books before I took the exam. This is the first one.There are too many errors in the book. If you already bought it, you need to download the corrections from its publisher's webpage. After I read the other two books: Complete Java2 Certification Study Guide and Exam Cram, (another book is highly recommended here: A Programmer's Guide to Java Certification) I realized I had wasted my time on the book being reviewed. I could have passed the exam earlier.Besides, there is no mock exam in the book. However, some parts are well-written, for example: inner class, java.util (Collection interface)."
5,Best study guide,"I think this is the study guide that will get you to pass the exam in the best way. It is simple and clear and the explanations are making sense to me more than some others do. I became very prepared for the exam this way, and I followed the book 9 chapters in sequence and did all the practice exams. I knew that I was ready for the real exam when I did well on the exam on the CD-ROM. This study guide is very nice to read and I enjoyed it very much. I understand things now that I had doubts at before."
1,The simulated exam software is too bad,"Not mention the errors from the book. The simulated exam from the CD is too bad. It is very hard to use. I just finished with one of the simulated exam. I selected close book version. Guess what, the time limit is 1 and half hour ( stardard is 2 hours) and the default number of questions is 65 ( the book mentions that the stardand exam is 61). It uses higher percentage for pass scoring. I don't know what the author is thinking. What are you really simulated for ? I don't know what will be in the actual exam, the small window drives me crazy. I have to scroll up/down repeatly for the question and the answer options. When I ran out of time, the software does not allow me to review the incorrect and incomplete although the buttons are there. It always poped up one window to tell me that time is up."
2,Maybe the next edition will be usable?,"This book seems to have been rushed into production; it desperately needs a revised second printing. As it stands, however, there are just too many errors and misstatements for it to be taken seriously. Also, the topics are somewhat out of line with the questions on the exam.Finally, a tough blow for people who are studying hard for the Sun Certified Java Programmer exam: in nearly every one of the practice tests at the ends of the book's chapters, one or more of the book's suggested answers to their own test questions are simply wrong, wrong, wrong. If this book's practice exams give you high marks, you probably will not do very well on the actual exam.If I hadn't switched over to the Sybex book, I probably would have failed the exam, but I passed it the first time. However, it cost me a week or so of finding and unlearning all the misinformation that I had already absorbed. So I recommend avoiding that."
3,Ok not sufficient for the Test,"Its good for a start. It has few good chapters like the Garbage collection and few more but not enough for the test. I had to buy one more book ""The complete Java 2 Certification Study guide "" by Simon Roberts and also the Java 2 Exam cram."
5,This book makes me pass the exam,"This is the best book I have even seen for the Java 2 exam preparation. I got 91%. It gives you a thorough understanding of the concepts you need to know to pass the exam. The included mock exam is very similar to the real test. This book alone is enough for you.Thank you, Kathy."
1,Not the best Java cert book,"If you plan on only buying one book, this should not be at the top of your list. The book does a poor job of covering the AWT stuff and doesn't even mention I/O. The book was written by committee and shows it. It does do a good job of opening your eyes to the level of detail that must be mastered in order to become certified. However, there are better books out there (Roberts et al, then Boone et al) and your preparation dollar would be better spent on one of those."
5,A New Way of Thinking,"Block presents the concept of stewardship as a new form of leadership or governance that places service ahead of self-interest and creates partnership rather than dependency. It takes the idea of empowerment presented in his earlier book, The Empowered Manager, to a whole new level. Block is constantly contrasting traditional leadership with the model of stewardship with phrases like ""service over self-interest,"" ""patriarchy vs. partnership,"" and ""dependency vs. empowerment,"" to name a few. The main idea is that commitment to the larger community or organization is what creates effective organizational systems, and we inspire that commitment by allowing those involved to create the vision and determine the path toward that vision. I highly recommend this book for those looking to think more systemically about organizational life."
3,THE MUMMY,"FIRST OFF, THE GAME IS CHALLENGING AND REQUIRES SOME HAND EYE COORDINATION. YOU WILL NEED SOME CHEAT CODES IN THE END UNLESS YOU PLAYED THE GAME OVER 200 TIMES. I HAD TO REPEAT SOME LEVELS BECAUSE THEY WERE TOUGH BUT EVENTUALLY YOU GET THE HANG OF IT. EVERY GAME HAS A SEQUENCE TO IT AND ONCE YOU FIGURE THE PATTERN YOU WIN ALMOST ALL THE TIME. AS FOR GRAPHICS, I DONT KNOW WHY PEOPLE EVEN BOTHER DISCUSSING GRAPHICS BECAUSE OF COURSE THE HEADS WILL BE SQUARE AND THE SCENERY WILL NOT BE AS DYNAMIC , BECAUSE THESE PLATFORMS DATE BACK A FEW YEARS AGO. SO THE GRAPHICS IN TODAYS PLATFORMS SUCH AS PS2/DREAMCAST OR NOW XBOX ARE LIFELIKE. IF YOU WANT GREAT GRAPHICS UPGRADE TO A MORE NEWER PLATFORM SUCH AS DREAMCAST OR XBOX AND TOSS THE OLD TECHNOLOGY OUT. REMEMBER THE OLD SAYING, AS SOON AS YOU BUY YOUR COMPUTER ITS ALREADY OUTDATED. COMPARE THE SONY GRAPHICS TO THE OLD SEGAS OR NINTENDO. BUT NO 360 DEGREE REVOS IN THOSE OLD GAMES HEY! HARD TO FIND THE ONES THAT DID."
2,How many great movies must be turned into bad games!,"I've rented this game, and how I regret that I didn't pick up a different one! The graphics are absurd. The faces are detailed, but Brendan Fraser looks chunky in the cinemas and there is lots of polygon pop up. The control is a pain. Why does it take forever to walk backwards? And why does pressing the jump button take you so far? Some jumps seem impossible to make. The camera can be a problem too. Whenever I start shooting, the camera goes over my head making it difficult to see the enemy. I can't even beat the second level, so I'm not sure what the rest of the game is like. But with the problems I mentioned it will probably just get worse. The only things this game has to offer is the satisfaction of shooting or slicing mummies like Brendan Fraser. The music is pretty cool."
3,To easy.,"This game is to easy. I mean, you could take day-off and beat it. The graphics and gameplay are good, but not worth it. Do yourself a favor and rent it."
5,Classic Wodehouse,"This is a perfect introduction into the world of Wodehouse. Although it does not involve Bertie Wooster or Jeeves, it does involve a set of interconnected characters getting into the awkward predicaments and hilarious misunderstandings that are the trademark of of Wodehouse. I've read a couple dozen of Wodehouse's works, and this is one of my favorites!"
4,Keith,"Jesse McCartney was great in this movie! The acting was good but the story plot was a bit ""messed up"". Its a little disturbing what Keith does to the girl in this movie emotionally. But overall its a great movie!"
2,Not as good as the reviews indicate.,"This movie would appeal to some teenage girls, that is about all I can say. I have seen much better."
3,Pretty Good,"It's a cute movie. I would definitely recommend it for a girl's movie night. It was predictable, but not corny.The DVD doesn't come with any special features, which is my favorite part about DVDs. I would have really loved some from this movie because I love Jesse McCartney, but the movie was still enjoyable and worth watching again & again."
5,The Best!,One of the Best Movie I've ever seen. Very touching. Phenomenal performance. This is definitely one of my top 3!
2,Really buggy release,"This is a very buggy release that Adobe has been slow to fix. Adobe Bridge crashes frequently (and I am working on a Macpro with a 4GB RAM and 3.0 GHZ processors). Likewise, InDesign has a known bug with indexing if you are trying to create an index across multiple documents. Check to see if they have fixed these issues before upgrading if these programs are crucial to your workflow. These issues are current as of August 2007."
4,Children with starving brains,This book is packed full of great information! My 5 year old son was recently diagnosed with ADHD and this book does a great job of explaining( in depth) what exactly this condition is. It also does a great job of explaining how to heal the body and choosing a sugar/diary/gluten free diet. I've followed the suggestions and we are now working with an hollistic doctor. I've seen a change in my son's hyperactivity after removing the sugars and the fast food. He is even doing much better in school!
1,"HOPEFUL BOOK, BUT NOT VERY SCIENTIFIC","It is obvious that McCandless is passionate about what she thinks about and writes about, but she is buying into Shaw, Rimland and others who favor treating the symptoms of autism instead of being brave enough to really look at the root causes. Lisa Lewis and the diet people deserve no respect whatsoever.Let's take a deeper look at autism and stop pretending we know all the answers. I have a son who is severely autistic with CD."
5,My bible for biomedical treatment of ASD,This book is utterly invaluable in determining how your child became damaged and more importantly how to undo the damage. I have recommended this book to dozens of parents of children on the spectrum and it is always top of my book list in how to help/cure your child with autism.
1,I am sorry to have bought this book.,"bsisson@staffnet.com from Fredericksburg, VA , September 6, 1999""Too much verbiage that is not related to the subject This book was obviously written with unneeded verbiage in order to make a large volume. The verbiage simply works to confuse the reader. The subject could be well covered in about one third of the text and would then be much easier to understand. Some of the methods described as the only way to do something are way off the mark. There are easier simpler ways. Not a book to use for this subject. ""I COULD NOT AGREE MORE with Fredericksburg's comments on this book."
1,great anime. lousy packaging.,"this rating is for the packaging only. It seems that the guys at sentai really don't care about packaging, because this is the second anime that i see like this, the other been princess resurrection. I wouldn't of minded paying a little bit more if they were blue-ray and they came like this, but since they are DVDs they will scratch really easy. Again, this review is for the packaging, the anime itself is great. P.S. if you buy this anime, also buy a piece of cloth, (the kind for cleaning glasses). If you cut the cloth and place it between the discs, they wont scratch if you keep them in the box it came with."
1,Did not work long,"Product was as ordered, but did not power the laptop but for a day or two. Total waste of money. Not worth returning."
1,Broken in a few ways Good for the price if it worked.,"I got it and a week later it stopped working. I bought it for the price and it seemed alright quality at first. After investigating, the problem was in the wiring leading to the adapter, and i hadnt even removed the plug from the wall yet. If i twisted the wire just right and didnt touch it it would work. After a couple more days it would occasionally get upset at me and the light on the adapter would blink on and off and wont charge my computer. Now i have no adapter for my computer and im out the price of the product and a decent amount due to shipping. :("
1,Incorrect Voltage,"product arrived on time, but when plugged into laptop, it did not have enough voltage to power up the computer. no mention of voltage on ad."
1,Horrible service,"I ordered the Dell PC adapter making sure it is the right model. I received the wrong adapter that is not compatible with my laptop and the invoice has the right adapter on it. I have emailed customer service several times and have yet to hear anything about it. I would like to get a new, right adapter but customer service is not responding. This is the worst service I have ever had."
4,Interesting and thought provoking,"Mr. Jaworski's book is very good reading, you just have to realize not everyone has the same drama quotient in their daily lives. It is inspiriational with just a little unbeliveability."
4,The Grinch,"Grinch is a great game. My husband and I are both hooked on it. We are, however, stuck right now. We can't find the last part of the climbing gear. Anyone have any advice? I would not purchase this game for kids, it is just too hard. There are a lot of puzzles to figure out. You really have to think in this game. Overall, I would recommend this game."
3,Painstakingly slow,"This book is a slow as the adoption process. Not a particularly good book to read if you are more interested in the adaption after adoption, since it stops at adoption."
1,Horse Lover?,"The first book I have read of Smiley's, I was not impressed. It felt disjointed, awkward, and rather silly at times. She humanizes her horses to the point where it feels absurd. I fell in love with her horses, but I was less impressed with the author.After reading the book, I learned that Waterwheel, one of the horses featured in the book, was dumped at auction (Barrett's January mixed sale) lame and pregnant, and sold for the near rock bottom price of $1000. After bringing her owner in so much money through this book, she couldn't afford to keep her retired? Sorry, but I refuse to buy books written by a hypocrite, and I will never read a Smiley book ever again."
4,Getting the story straight,"The quotes that reviewer Greg Smith has included aren't actually in this book. They are on a liberal web site where Ms Smiley and several others really let it rip the day after the election. And while that may not have been the kindest thing to do, given the usual midwestern subject matter of her books, it really isn't relevant to whether this particular book is good or bad. Ms Smiley is entitled to voice her opinion. (First ammendment and all that.) If you want to read this essay in it's entirety, reviewer SC has thoughtfully provided the URL on every single Smiley title. What a service;-P I've read most of Jane Smiley's books and they are all excellent. Well written. Funny. Heartwarming. I even liked the books about horses, which normally aren't my favorite animal. Don't skip her books over politics, because her stories don't include the kind of rhetoric that her essay did. They are marvelous."
1,awful,"These strings are absolutely horrendous. They're not even playable, really. They make terrible nails-on-the-chalkboard sounds. And yes, I know how to play fiddle. My old strings sounded fine."
5,Courtney,I wont say that I like this book at ALL! But as far as the purchase it came in a very timely manner and it was basically brand new and had all the pages and chapters!
4,"A good ""greatest hits"" CD, live","This CD functions really well as a ""greatest hits"" package for The Choir, in some ways better than their ""Kissers and Killers"" CD (which you also should own). For example, this CD has ""Circle Slide"" and ""Chase the Kangaroo,"" which the other doesn't. It also has wonderful versions of ""Yellow Skies"" (a rocker) and ""Love Your Mind"" (my favorite of their love songs).The first 4/5 of the CD is 5 stars; after that, you can begin to tell that Derri's voice is getting tired (rats, it's on a couple of really good songs, too). So 4 stars overall--but keep in mind, a 4-star Choir CD is way better than most of the stuff on here getting 5 stars. Buy it and crank it up!"
2,Too much of the same,"Unfortunately, I didn't go much on this box set as I found the tracks very similar in sound. However, will selectively choose tracks for airplay on 5MBS at opportunity. This CD is better, in my opinion, played one track in isolation."
3,Definitely no comparison to Messiah,"A faulted hero always seems more human and believable, such as Red Metcalfe in ""Messiah"". Kate Beauchamp in ""Storm"", however, is untolerably winny and tedius. The storyline with the ferry accident is original but seems lengthy and weakens the story rather than strengthens it. It's still a good read compared to most books out there. Guess it's hard to follow ""Messiah""."
4,Great Read,Storm was not as good as Starling's first book Messiah but i enjoyed it very very much!! It had a big surprise and I loved the detail that he went into explaining the things that were done to the people in this book! This was a great book!
2,Extensively padded,"This book probably could have been half its present thickness if the authors had cut out needless repetition and large graphics that illustrate simple points. For example, half of one page is taken up showing a web page with an alert box, just in order to tell you what an alert box is. Scripts are done piece by piece, and after each additional snippet of code, the entire script is reproduced. The index really shows how the publishers padded out the book - each page is two columns of very large text with huge borders on all sides and between the columns. The information contained in the book is fairly good, but I don't like to feel that I've been ripped off by paying for a 1000-page book that by rights should have been a 500-page book. I have found that I tend to reach for my Dynamic Web Publishing Unleashed book a lot more frequently - it covers basically the same topics, plus quite a few others."
3,CANNOT BE USED WITH CORDLESS PHONES ~,for a home based business w/a cordless phone-- cant use it.Has very good clarity @ close range.
5,Good book,"Good item, I got this item on timeGood bookIt was I expected when I order this. I recommend."
3,OK,"Just OK, they were much smaller than I expected. Do not purchase for a woman who's hair may fall near the ears as these earrings will not be seen"
3,J- Hoop Earrings,For the price I was expecting bigger hoops earrings.I like the earrings but disapointed in size the stones are small as well.
1,Very poorly designed & written,"This book attempts to fit programmers in the same literary mold as end users of applications. Very poorly written, it seems to be aimed at simply showing off the Visual J++/WFC API, without giving readers a sense of the basic steps associated with the subjects it covers. Code examples are extremely confusing, because they don't follow Java coding conventions, and they don't contain the function or class wrappers. This leads the reader to wonder whether or not to include the code automatically generated by the Visual J++ environment.I use Visual J++ 6.0 at work every day. It's a great tool (even though it DOES bastardize the Java platform), and this book is simply a marketing tool designed to trumpet the product's features without giving much in the way of information. It's funny: Microsoft used to include this type of propaganda with its products. Now we have to pay for it!"
1,Less than worthless.,A complete waste of time and money. Negative 5 stars. This book contains no valuable subtance nor useful examples. More information is available from online help and web resources. It is poorly organized and doesn't fully cover the command syntax for someone familiar with other high-level languages moving over to VBA.
2,expert in Lotus I am trying to get up to speed in Excel,"I don't like this book yet...I am on page 200 and can't say I know a single thing about the subject. The book seems to be written backwards starting with the ""language"", Too narrative, I am going looking for a better book can't waste any more time. It is the first book of this type I have found to be of so little help. For example, the first reference to ""Dim"" is on page 25, the explanation of the use of this term is on page 115"
2,Bad Index,"I bought this book and I am not satisfied because the examples are not clear, the index is not complete. The contents are not bad and quite complete. I think the author want to make the book as a reference book but fail because it is very difficult to find even the keywords."
2,Beginners book,I bougth this book last year as a beginner in Excel Macro programming. I`m still a beginner. This book is probably a good book for someone who knows thay way around macro programming. I gave up on learning from this book.
2,"Heavy, hard to get through!","I, too, tried several times to get through this book. Even at the height of my fascination with Greece, this book was like a huge, dry steak that I could not digest.I didn't sense that blood-stirring something extra that I expected.But a very thorough book!"
1,what a waste,This band has been around as long as the Stones and deserves a full boxed set of concert DVDs and a few documentaries as well as a full collection of their videos.This release of five videos of songs that are far from the bands best will just get in the way of a better project being released.Who could possibly want to own this?The two concert DVDS by the band are old and not even in widescreen mode and the better one(Albert Hall) is way too short.The band is down to three original members so time is running out for this legendary group.I hope this is not the last dvd released by the band.
5,Good service,"Fascinating book supplied by a reputable book seller: very quick, professional service. The book was well packaged and arrived in excellent condition."
3,LOVE IT! LOVE IT!,"For beginner or advanced such a variety. I would recommed to everyone. I put my ""RETURN TO"" sticker on this one FAST!"
3,The CD,"this CD was average. i have heard and bought much better cds. i would not recommend buying this cd when you can be using your money on much better cds. but this cd was still good. all the words were clear and i understood everything. if you like masta ace and group home then i would recommend it, but eminem has alot better music then this. for example, the marshall mathers lp is the best cd ever. so i think you should buy that one. the lyrics are pretty cool. so for some people this cd would be good, but for others it wouldnt. it all depends on what you like."
3,disapointing effort from the king of rap,"eminem kicked started his career at the top with ground breaking beats like brain damage and cum on everybody,then on the marshall mathers lp he had drug ballad and the way I am along with his number one hit the real slim shady and stan.all these had his lyrics ones he wrote and great beats produced by dr.dre, but game over has too many hooks with other rappers eminem does not do enough work on this albim to make it a big success like the marshall mathers lp,being a big big fan of his i was pretty much ..... with this recent attempt! p.s. better luck next time."
5,A Great Read,"The book I received was a steal - literally a penny, and I was expecting to pay $20. As for the story, it was typical Destroyer style. Great parody of a few celebrities, strong character development for the leads, and realistic ... social behavior, is that can be ascribed to the characters and world these stories come from. Highly recommended!"
2,So is this information believable?,"Received this book today. Started reading it in anticipation of my head gasket replacement. Noticed that the diagram for the 6-cylinder firing order doesn't match the text.Not sure if I can trust the rest of the information in this book, if they're not able to proofread it enough to catch this."
4,Good story....,"I must say that although I did enjoy this book, I was also a little disappointed as well. The main character, Miriam, was well defined and I did get caught up in the details of her life. I found myself longing for the kind of faith she had to face what life threw her way. Miriam's story was most enjoyable.I was disappointed that we know so little about Julianna. Why was she at Miriam's house? What is her backstory? Why was she so captivated by Miriam's story & what kind of changes did it make in her life? The book is good, but in this reader's mind, left too many unanswered questions and a desire for more info about Julianna, past and present."
1,YAWN!!!!!,IT IS THE MOST BORING GAME EVER!!! ( by the way im 9 ) and its very hard and very weird and boring because all you do is put the music in and it says ok here is how you play and all that stuff and the only thing is you play level one once level two once you cant even it two times unles if you wanna hear how to play!!!!! lets just say this BORING!!!
4,Good and Informative.,"The information is good and more than enough to pass the exam. The review question is a bit disappointed. I wish the author or the publisher can use the objective format in the review question rather than the word puzzle format which is a bit waste of time trying to find the answer. Apart from the bad review question format, this is an excellent book to have."
2,Too bad it broke,"This CD player was wonderful...until it broke. I was overseas at the time listening as usual to a CD on the metro when all of a sudden the music stopped. I took the player out of my bag and opened it. To my total shock and surprise the little plastic ring you snap the CD onto was in pieces. How strange is that? Nothing else was wrong with the player, only the fact that I could no longer secure the CD to be played. Since I wasn't in America I could not use its warranty which is only one year after the purchase date and this incident happened eleven months after anyway. After that, I bought a minidisc player which was stolen in Istanbul four months after I bought it. So now I have an iPod which is wonderful so far although transferring the music to it hasn't been going all that fast. Good luck."
5,And now for something completely different...,"This book is not for everyone, but it's nonetheless amazing. Sometime hilarious, sometimes tragic, consistently thought provoking and beautiful.Oh, and strange. Very, very strange, mixing bits of fabulism and the fantastic with cold, gritty reality, and mundane reality, and a healthy dose of lingual spice. Olsen plays on the page like no one else."
2,laughable european fusion,the playing is okay. kinda like second rate mahavishnu orchestra without mclaughlin. the operatic vocalizing is laughable. how can anyone take the europeans seriously?
2,Missing test info,This isn't really a CIT exam guide. Some good study material that can help you if you combine with the Cisco class.
1,Absolutely Not The Book To Buy To Pass The CIT Test.,"This book is poorly organized and material descriptions are very weak. Test questions barely relevant to actual test. I don't think anybody can pass CIT test by studying this book. If you really need good material for CIT test, turn to CiscoPress!"
2,This book is not enough to pass the current CIT exam,"I was very surprised to sit down at the actual exam and find that 80-90% of the questions on the 640-440 exam were not covered in this book. Many exam questions were in fact, well out of the range of this book. Having said that however, I do believe the book contains some useful general information, just not enough to pass the exam. I guess I will wait for the Cisco Press book."
1,disappointing,"Not only was the quality of the video very poor, but it wasn't even the right video. I do not recommend this product to anyone and hope that the seller is ashamed of this blatent false advertising."
2,A big disappointment,"Lawler's intro to the first disk is one of the best attention getters, mood-setters I've heard. From there on out, however, both disks are a big disappointment. I hoped for ""a trip down the Congo"" -- something like an extended version of the first two track on Tenaglia's Athens2 CD. I didn't expect much melody; but I did expect it to take me on some sort of journey, however deep, dark, and nasty. Instead, Lawler soon loses the plot, drifting off into uninspired, percussion-orientated middle ground. This isn't sex, it's banging; neither deep enough to be challenging, nor accesible enough to be fun."
4,"Dark, cool, enchanting","Steve Lawler has found a niche as the master of the 'dark drums', and this CD cements that reputation. From the single conga and voice-over intro to the end, it's cool tribal rhythms, Lawler-style. CD1 is the better of the two and flows nicely from beginning to end. I disagree that it loses steam near the end; to the contrary, I think he really hits his stride at about mid-disc. Lawler's take on house music is not as radical of a shift from the ordinary as you might think, but it definitely feels several shades darker when it's over."
4,An outstanding overview of what is required for prosperity.,"A wonderful book, full of extraordinay insights into the workings of various societies. Bethell demonstrates how more than anything else, a society's legal and social attitude toward private property will determine how prosperous it is. Should be required reading for high school seniors and all politicians!"
1,Sub par graphics.... just to start,All I have to say about this game is that it was one of the most dissapointing purchases I have ever made. It is a rip off of diablo and a poor one at that. This game does not fullfill the graphics potential playstation 2 has to offer. Wait for Final Fantasy.
2,Was having fun until buried by a barrage of bugs.,"I don't mind the barely-better-than-ps1 look of the graphics. The graphics were good enough. I was getting into the story, combat was interesting, I liked the way characters leveled up, the side-quests were often amusing, looking forward to summoning all sorts of monsters until...I couldn't even get past the first big city when one bug after another combined the make the game distasteful. I'm sure it's possible to work around some of the bugs except, at MOST, this is just an average RPG and it's not worth trouble to fight the bugs when there are dozens to hundreds of playable RPGS that AREN'T so buggy.I was impressed enough by what I did see in the game that I'm likely to give Summoner II a shot - very few bug complaints on that game."
2,Typical RPG fare toned-down,"While the voice-acting is decent and the graphics are passable, the game is sorely lacking in the key areas of gameplay and story. Combat is slow-paced and boring and the landscape is a snooze with very little of interest. The plot is about as generic as fantasy plots come and fails to generate a sense of urgency or empathy...although you can see the character, you don't care about him or his plight. Dry pseudo-historical facts thrown at the player (""this is the xth year since the battle of generic name, the yth year since king blah started to reign"") were probably designed to be a Tolkien-esque backstory to the game but only serve to confuse the player with a litany of pointless names and meaningless events. In short: there are too many games out there which succeed where this failed. Play one of those and don't waste time on this one."
1,Best left for a pc not a ps2,This is the worst game I played in the PS2. The graphics look like they come from a bad pc game (the kind of game that can run in old PCs). The fighting is unimpressive given that I supposedly have the most powerful gaming console and controller in my hands. Seeing the main character confront the bad guys makes you feel like your pressing one of the directional arrows in your PC. The final fantasy series in playstation 1 even beats this playstation 2 wannabee hands down. I wish I could have my money back!
1,"Not Very pleased, at all","This game ... is very bad. 2 get 2 the point.A. The graphics were awful, looked like something from early N64, not PS2B. The story plot was bad also.C. world was huge, you could easily get lost and that took any of the little fun out of the game.and D. It was confusing, there were a lot of little mini-quests, but the problem was, even finding how to solve them.Anyhoo, i could go on and on about how bad this game was. But if you want 2 figure it out 4 yourself, rent it, don't waste your money on this cheap piece of garbadge"
1,Are we having fun yet??,"This game simply stinks. The controls are terrible, the plot.. what plot? I got a couple hours into it, and had to stop, simply because my brain was shutting down to stop the pain. I can't believe a sequel was made....Bottom line, if you enjoy playing games... avoid this one like the plague."
3,"Interesting Storyline, not impressive graphics","First of all, I was expecting more for a PS2 game in terms of graphics.The Good: The characters do have some interesting ""feel & look"". The environment is usually nice with rendered images. The storyline is okay. You can have multiple sub quest leading you into a non-so-much linear game.The Bad: Not much FMV's (a still picture that moves is not FMV for me). The 3D rendering has major problems rendering buildings that are far away; in that regards, you see the background picture and then the far buildings start to pop in; looks really bad.Bottom line, it does have a good storyline, so far, and the fact of have multiple sub quests is cool as well. It will attract some gamers until a real complete adventure game comes in on the PS2"
3,Could be better...,"There are some cool ideas, but overall... the execution seems weak to me. The storyline is complex, but the gameplay very thin. Basically you spend most of your time fighting boring encounters and wondering around trying to find the summoner rings to complete the quest.Graphics are average - Mapping is terrible - Gameplay is average. - Replayability is very low."
2,Summonner- alrightbut yet bad,"This games graphics are awesome, but the one thing I hate about it is the way the dialogue is. It is in light blue in a dark blue box, and I can't see it for the life of me! I play in a bright room too! I haven't gotten very far, but the game hasn't inspired me to do it. A real disappointment."
2,Something to Sell at a Yard Sale,"This is an inferior product. I bought it mainly for use on vacations or as something on which to audition tapes or discs when I don't feel like using my component system. Even for these limited uses, it is bad news.Despite its limited use, the CD player tends to skip on discs that play perfectly elsewhere. The tape player is even more unreliable. Sony puts sound mode settings on this unit, but they make absolutely no difference, regardless of the source. The sound quality at any setting is only fair at best. If you want ""mega bass"" (I don't particularly care), forget it. As with the sound modes, the button for mega bass is a fake.I hang on to it only because I don't use it enough to get sufficiently angry to smash it with an axe. I probably should sell it for about $2 at a yard sale, but I hate to rip someone off that way."
4,Sony Boombox Review,I ordered this for my daughter for Christmas. She has been using it since 1/1/08 and she loves it. I received this item within 3 days and I did not ask for express shipping.
2,DON'T DO IT!!!!,"I RECEIVED THE PRODUCT A COUPLE OF DAYS AGO. I'M VERY DISSAPOINTED! I'M 50+ YEARS OLD AND LONG FOR THE OLD SONY QUALITY DAYS BIG TIME. THE LED DISPLAY WAS BROKEN SO YOU CANNOT READ THE INTENDED INFORMATION.THE RADIO IS TERRIBLE I CANNOT GET ANY A.M. OR F.M.STATIONS NOT ONE! THE SOUND IS OKAY, NOT SONY OF OLD QUALITY IN ANY FUNCTION NOT THE RADIO, THE CD, OR THE CASSETTE. SAVE UP FOR A BETTER SYSTEM 98.00 SEEMS GREAT BUT NOT SO...I WILL SAVE UP AND WITH THE PROCEEDS OF THE GARAGE SALE PRICE OF THIS ITEM I WILL GET SOMETHING MUCH BETTER. 2 STARS....IT DID TURN ON.GOOD LUCK"
2,iMac... for which one?,"It's not for the iMac 7,1 2.8 GHz, but for a few dollars (used) it does decode a lot of the shortcuts and hidden functions using key combinations. that alone was worth the price!"
5,This is a really funny and sexy book that will teach you how,"This is a really funny and sexy book that will teach you how to play craps and how to win at craps just like Tina did. She didnt know how to play at the beginning and becomes a master by the end of it. It is also arranged into nifty monthly chapters (Jan, Feb, March, etc) and you learn the high points of Las Vegas at that time. It is, well, a pretty sexy book but what did you expect after the cover. Anyway Tina starts out as a hooker in downtown LV and meets a ""friend"" who gets her to ""volunteer"" to be a ""craps virgin."" Its pretty funny considering her occupation. Anyway she turns out liking the game, meeting a guy and then losing him, and starting another business. She also learns a lot of systems, meets a lot of strange people and has a lot of fun, and you will too! This book will make a terrific movie but I guess it would have to be R rated, still its great fun and I learned a lot about craps and the ""steamy"" side of Vegas!"
3,Medical physics made REAL easy,A laymen's explaination to medical physics. Only basic knowledge required to start learning. An overall review though.
2,Not as good as the Tripods Trilogy,"but worth a read to complete your knowledge of the tripods universe. The universe isn't as detailed as the original trilogy, and the characters aren't as real, 3-D"
5,Gave me nightmares for a month.,"**Very Minor Spoiler**This book, in my opinion, is the best in the series. It gives us much wanted answers, and a surprising twist. The Trippies are maddeningly mad, and it shows how capping came to be. When the Tripods Came is a must-read for people of all ages. It has science fiction and horror mixed with humour, and many grotesque twits."
5,Arg! Pokemon!,"The only thing I have to say is, look at the Teletubbies and the Pokemon craze. Then read the book. Then look at these fads again...from a distance. We may not be threatened in the near future by an invasion from space, but the concept of hypnotising by television/popular culture is close enough to put a chill down your spine. I recommend reading this one *after* the original trilogy. Surprisingly good for a ""young adult"" sci fi trilogy. Reminds me of ""The Giver"" in terms of scale and depth of human nature. Movie franchise plausible, laudable."
1,One of the worst asterix comics,"I am a great fan of Asterix & Co. But this is one of the worst among the 30 odd Asterix books. This book was both written and illustrated by Uderzo. May be if Goscinny was there it might have turned out better. The drawings are drab and the jokes more stereo-typed than funny. It starts well, but after few pages the author doesn't know how to proceed. I am surprised that the author didn't do the usual research about the theme, here about India. Remember how the Asterix and Cleopatra turned out to be a master piece. Total lack of knowledge about India and its environments and relying solely on stereo-type based jokes ruined the storey."
3,"The Plot, the punch lines, and the gags all read a bit stale","An Asterix, old or new, is a must read. But, this one is a tad disappointing. The jokes and punchlines are not as funny, the plot is a bit strained... Which is disappointing indeed. You have to have read some of the older Asterix comics - Mansion of the Gods for example - to understand what I mean. If you are a die hard Asterix fan then go ahead and read/buy this one. Else go for some of the older ones."
1,waste of money,"worked great for one year, then died 15 days after the warranty was up. I've had reliability problems with other smartdisk products too."
1,Beware this company and these drives.,"I purchased a Smartdisk model # XF250. After 3 months of use and about 100 GB of data, I dropped the unit from a height of 16 inches. It was not running at the time. This is an external drive that is supposed to handle that kind of mishap. Well, it didn't. The drive is toast and all my data is gone (unless I want to pay $2K to get it back).Smartdisk customer support first told me that the unit would be replaced under warranty. When I emailed them the serial number, they backed down on their pledge, saying they could not be held responsible for a dropped device.Their response was ""No hard drive is ""supposed"" to fall. Whether it be 2 inches or 2 feet. No hard drive manufacturer is going to warrant a drive that has taken a fall."" Sympathethic aren't they.This whole experience was a disaster of epic proportions for me and a direct result of me wanting to protect my data. Smartdisk has just rubbed salt into the wound."
3,Hewlett Packard Office Jet 710,"This is a great machine if you are looking mainly for the fax, scanner, and copier. The quality of color for printing is very poor. I would not recommend it to someone who is wanting nice color quality. I ended up returning the office jet for another printer of which, I am much more satisfied."
1,A Fleet of Boatnecks,"If you like high necklines on your sweaters then this is the book for you. 7 of the 13 patterns have high boatnecks, 2 patterns are turtlenecks and 2 cardigan patterns have high necklines. There is a nice V-neck twin set pattern, however, the largest size for the shell is a FINISHED 37""!!! The final pattern is a beautifully cabled V-neck pullover. Be aware that the largest FINISHED size in 4 of these patterns is 37, 37, 38 and 39""."
2,The pleasures of knitting,"I was very disappointed with this book. Although the sweater on the outside cover is lovely, the rest of the sweaters were a disappointment. Most of the sweaters in the book had a boatneck top and lacked personality and shaping. I would have liked to see a larger variety of sweater styles. The instructions seem to be clearly written but who cares if the sweaters are not what you want. Sweater styles are not well suited for slightly heavier set women. You would probably need to be a size 8 or smaller for the sweaters to look good on you. Unless you like very simple boatneck style sweaters, I would pass on this book."
1,Don't buy this book,"The patterns are boring, there are no charts and the sizing is for extra petite women only."
3,Boring Boring Boring,"NIce book, but very boring patterns. I can't decide whether to return this book or give it to my [...] knitting neighbor who will love these patterns."
1,replacement battery is defective,"Received the battery satisfactorily. However, it will not charge up so I think it is defective. How do I request a replacement?"
4,Danner Men's Radical 452 GTX Boot,"So far, so good. I've hiked about twenty miles in them. Easy to break in. Have not been in bad weather yet, so review is not complete"
1,Simplistic jingles...no spine-tingling here!,I was hoping to find scary music to play Halloween night to help set a creepy mood for the trick or treaters. I have a couple sound-effects cd's but I wanted SCARY MUSIC. The tunes on Vampyre at the Harpsichord/ Phantom of the Organ are simple child-like tunes that would do better to accompany a soap-opera.If you are looking for scary background music I would recommend Midnight Syndicate's Realm of Shadows or Born of the Night instead.
3,Goodbye to all that,"For the first half of this book I was irritated as heck-- it seemed as though Keating were doing a memory lane romp through all the Agatha Christie-land, with Inspector Ghote being forced to labor under every hackneyed assumption about detection to ever come out of the genre. Towards the end, however, it became a very sad book-- more about the death of empire and the passing of an age than anything else. There was something so majestic in the final moments that I was willing to forgive its other sins and excesses, grievous though they were.Ghote is summoned from Bombay to solve a murder at the Ooty Club-- the last bastion of colonial India. He needs to determine who left a servant dead in the middle of the billiard table and what all the motives are in the little enclave out of time."
5,I LOVE!!!!! THESE DOLLS! 5 BIG STARS!!!!,"WOW! I CANNOT BELIEVE!!! THE OTHER REVIEW HERE THAT I JUST READ! IS THAT LADY FOR REAL????? I THINK THAT GIVING KIDS MULTI-CULTURAL DOLLS IS A WONDERFUL! THING. IT TEACHES DIVERSITY & RESPECT FOR OTHER CULTURES & HERITAGES. I MYSELF COLLECT DOLLS AND I HAVE MANY DIFFERENT ETHNICITIES. I LIKE AND EMBRACE THE VARIETY IN MY DOLL COLLECTION. THIS OTHER WOMAN HERE IS OBVIOUSLY STUCK IN THE STONE AGE. POOH-POOH ON HER!!!! THESE DOLLS ARE VERY CUTE, THEY ARE ALL DRESSED FOR BALLET & IT IS SO NICE THAT YOU GET 5 DOLLS AT ONCE. (THAT IS AWESOME!). I GIVE THIS SET 5 GIGANTIC SUPER-DUPER, BIG, BRIGHT & SHINY STARS. AND I HIGHLY!!!! RECCOMEND THIS SET! WE NEED TO COMBAT THE IGNORANCE AND INTOLERANCE BEING PERPETRATED BY PEOPLE LIKE THE ONE WHO WROTE THAT MEAN, BIGOTED REVIEW BELOW. LET'S TEACH OUR KIDS TO EMBRACE OTHER CULTURES NOT TO SHUN THEM. THAT IS MY ADVICE."
5,A Sure Bet With Kids,"My teenage daughter has laughed herself silly with this book. It is full of all kinds of jokes, many of which are pretty corny. She shared a few dozen of them with me.Here are a couple of her favorites:Teacher: Now, who can explain Einstein's Theory of Relativity?Li'l Jay: Einstein?Teacher: Use the word MOTIF in a sentence.Li'l Jay: My grandma wears dentures because she has no motif.If you have a youngster who has a keen sense of humor, this will probably be a hit."
4,"Simply Beautiful, A must have for any Jazz/New age Collection!","WORTHY OF FIVE STARS, BUT MY FINGER SLIPPED! I first discovered this new age masterpiece as a senior in high school waaaayyyy back in 1988. And while I absolutely loved this cd, I somehow had forgotten it. Then while recently thumbing through my collection, I rediscovered it. And I found that it is just as moving now, as it was almost 20 years ago. I especially love ""Steam Forest"", it's almost VISUALLY moving. If you love Jazz and/or New Age, and you're looking for a different sound, you won't be disapointed with this choice. And while I also love his cd ""White Winds"", ""Down to the Moon"" will always bring back fond memories of my teenage friends, and the anticipation of entering a brave new world."
4,Nice old school new age....,Vollenwider is/was an innovative dude and it is still a nice album to listen to....enjoy this album with a quite friend!

3,Oldie but goodie,"Have been searching for this video tape for some time. Was hoping to find it in DVD format to no avail. My mom gave me a VCR so I decided to purchase this used tape. It is blurry but fine. I suspect its age has something to do with it being blurry. Anyway, I am thrilled to have it. I know the routine and that helps me to get up and just do it. Thanks, Amazon.Jennie B, Sarasota, FL"
4,Definitely Spoozys...,"With a slightly less electronic sound compared to the excellent ""Astral Astronauts"", the Spoozys' ""Astro 99"" mixes more of the same great wackiness with surf rock and noise. Perhaps a bit more bizarre than AA, this mini-album is definitely worth owning if enjoying the other Spoozys album. Each song has little addicting hooks, but the whole effort has a definite ""light"" feel. This can be expected as it seems to be the leftovers from ""Spoozys"", the Japanese name release of AA. Not as tight a purchase as AA in my opinion. But it IS the Spoozys, so it's hard to find too much wrong with it. Let's face it, if you are reading this then you already know what the Spoozys are about, and you'll probably buy the disc anyway. :)"
1,Typical Chinese Junk (not an ethnic slam),"These are poorly made and not even worth keeping if they were free. A good philosophy is to buy the best tools that you can afford... however, if you can only afford this set, I'd recommend buying a single tool or two for the same price. At least half of these tools should be tossed in the trash and the rest are simply mediocre, at best."
5,interesting,"In my opinion this is a very good book, and contains manyinsightful essays on Brautigan' life and work. It's a finecontribution to the growing literature on this neglectedwriter. RB is a kind of an American Robert Walser, alwaysfollowing his own quirky way of thought. His work is oftenseemingly cheerful, like Walser's, but closer reading revealsthe deep sadness beneath his words. This book shows very wellwhy Brautigan's writing is so unique. Like always is the casewith writers, but especially with RB,his writings reflect hislife, and as his depression grew in his last years, his workbecame increasingly dark in tone and subject. I think thosesincerely interested in Brautigan will not be disappointedwith this collection."
4,Moving and great acting,"This movie will stick with you for some time. It really illustrates how the death of someone that was truly loved can have a serious impact on the way a person lives. All actors are great here-Lopez , Freeman and the young actress are great. A special note must be made for Redford's acting-this is Oscar worthy. A great character study movie and an important movie about life and death."
2,UNIMPRESSED !,"I really like all the cast members of this film. However, I found the film to be predictable and very slow. I was not impressed."
5,"No, it couldn't have been better......","...it was what it was - great acting by the legends (Redford, Freeman, Bart the Bear) - beautiful scenery. A movie you watch by the fire and enjoy good acting."
1,Disappointed,Product of poor quality. Dark in color and hard to distinguish characters and background. Had I not seen the movie before I really would have been confused. I purchased the best value offered. Guess I got what I paid for. Lesson Learned!
5,good,very good liked it any one can watch if you rodeo you know the drill share every thing but your woman
5,An Unfinished Life,"One of the best movies I have seen in a long time. Morgan Freeman, Robert Redford and Jennifer Lopez. Lopez and her daughter are running from an abusive relationship. They seek temporary asylum from her former father-in-law (Redford) who lives on a downtrodden ranch out west. Redford blames Lopez for the death of his son and actively disdains his daughter-in-law. Lopez's daughter Griff, begins the healing process between the two. I would highly recommend this movie for teens and adults (several brief violent scenes). Leads one to consider their own relationships and tightly held grudges."
5,Even the Bear Did a Great Job,"Wasn't expecting to enjoy this movie as much, but it was great. Jennifer Lopez as the victim of domestic violence, Morgan Freeman as the wise but bruised cowhand, and Robert Redford as the grumpy former father-in-law/unexpected grandpa were top notch. In the scene where Freeman's character meets the bear face to face, even the bear hams it up.This is a warm movie about forgiveness,companionship and the importance of family. Well done."
5,Excellant,"I loved this movie. Just happened to catch it on TV when I was surfing the different stations/channels. When I see a movie with Robert Redford, Morgan Freeman and Jennifer Lopez ---- than I KNOW its going to be a good movie. And it was. The sceanery was so beautiful I want to go visit Wyoming. The story was a good story and I felt each actor played their parts very well---even Bart the bear. I think it was a shame that the movie got lost in the cracks somewhere and was not played up so more people would see it. I highly recommend this movie. I definately want to watch it again and I intend to purchase a DVD of the movie so I CAN in fact watch it again."
2,subtitle????? spanish?????,I saw this movie on television and enjoyed it so i bought it for my mother. She needs subtitles and was very disappointed to find out they are in spanish not english. NOT HAPPY!
1,"Wow, what rubbish!","So the Pussycat Dolls are having a reality show, to find a new member? Sheesh. Shows how utterly disposable they are as a group. Would you have seen the likes of Nirvana doing so? I think not.Another reason to hate the 2000s, ladies and gentlemen. Call me a pessimist, but I don't see it getting any better. I hope I'm wrong...(I'll be surprised if this review is still up a week later.)"
1,PCD Live,"I was totally dissappointed with this DVD. If that was really their live show in London I feel very sorry for their fans. It was like they were just singing in my living room. The stage was a joke. It was sooo small.There was no stage show at all, no pizzaz, nothing.Again it was a big dissappointment."
4,"Good stuff, cruddy container","One nice thing I wasn't sure about was whether this stuff was gluten-free... turns out it IS, so yay for that. The down side... this jar is HUGE and only filled halfway (if that...). I would MUCH rather have a container that is more appropriate for the contents, because this huge empty thing is going to take up a huge footprint in my very limited cabinet space. I will transfer it into a better jar as soon as I have one. But I just don't understand why the company is willing to waste so many resources (plastic and shipping) on empty air. Just pointless and it makes me think less of NOW as a business."
3,"Good price, but not my favorite taste","It could just be my preference, but I prefer the New Star brand better. New Star is also pricier....but this didn't make my recipes taste as good as they normally do (which is a must when I'm trying to convince people my healthy food tastes good)! Still a great price though..."
2,a rich atmosphere isn't enough,"While the premise of this book is wonderfully original, and while the atmosphere is dark, rich and realistically crafted (yes, I accepted intelligent dogs in Prussian dress), I found the narrative weak and the characters dull. Nor could I find an underlying chemistry to support various relationships -- the deep friendship, for instance, between Cleo and Ludwig.For me, this was far from, as one reviewer said, ""[a] dazzling, unforgettable meditation on what it means to be human."" Thematically, I saw nothing new, nothing ""unforgettable."" The reviewer, I think, confuses appearance for substance: the atmosphere may have been impressive -- but impressive clothes do not the person make.The novel emerges, I think, as an original idea that at best, was mundanely crafted."
1,A disappointing read,"First, let me say that I really wanted to like this book. I liked the premise of it, and looked forward to reading it. However, I noticed a large plot hole in it and that spoiled the entire book for me. One of the author's premises was that the dogs were operated on to increase their intelligence, and had to be ""re-fitted"" with prosthetic hands as they grew up. But the rebel leader, Mops Hacker, was ""thrown away"" by the scientist who had worked on Mops' father. If Mops grew up in isolation, how did he gain intelligence? Who fitted him with his new prosthetic hands as he grew?? I had thought that, perhaps, the mating of the two ""monster dogs"" had produced a dog that did not need the operations. There was no indication of this in the book, however. I find it saddening that this was not noticed. I also found the ending to not be as good as the beginning of the book. It seemed almost ""tacked on""."
2,A talking dog book without an ounce of humor. Lighten up!,"I appreciate deep themes and pathos as much as anyone, maybe more. But every good story should have some humor, without humor, subtle and important themes become quagmires of mud and darkness. How can you have a book with talking dogs and not have one single scene with a cat running by while the dog is trying to maintain an intelligent conversation in a high society setting. Kirsten probably needs to take a vacation and learn to laugh again."
3,Takes a long time to get,"On December 11, 2006 I ordered this pot for myself and used the ""FREE"" shipping method. Today is December 29th and I still haven't received it. Good thing I didn't need it for a gift.The item description reads: Availability: In Stock. Ships from and sold by Target. I checked the status of this shipment and Amazon's website tells me estimated delivery is January 10-26, 2007.I just don't think it should take this long, if indeed the item was ""in Stock"". Hopefully I will get it and be able to start cooking! Happy New Year."
3,good for posta,i also burnt the handle on this one the first time out coustomer svc said not to use it on two burners but i thought that was the point thay will replace
1,MISLEADING REPACKAGING,"The one star rating is not for the quality of the performance in the DVD, but rather because this is a repackaging of the ""Best of Musikladen"" Hall & Oates performance.Nowhere in this DVD does it state where this supposed concert took place, and the cover photo is not of anything contained in the DVD.If you are a big Hall & Oates fan you probably already have this DVD. It's been offered twice before with different cover art. At least in the past both versions stated that it was the Musikladen TV series performances.I feel ripped off for buying something that I already own, when the package art ??intentionally?? makes no note of details of the show."
4,Looks like a good product,Happy to see the padding which I hadn't really seen in the photos. I'll need to do some work to shorten the straps for my application though. Shouldn't be too much of a problem though.
2,"Imbalanced, inessential","This book, Pynchon's earliest published short story, puts on display the traits that will make Pynchon one of the finest English-language writers ever: a free-wheeling imagination; a catholic, encyclopaediac store of knowledge; a troubled morality; and a capacity to be damn funny.If you've read _V_ or the short story ""Entropy"", you've seen this setup before: a college party and a protagonist operating within that system. There are very good reasons it was left out of _Slow Learner_: the humor is forced, the ideas aren't fully formed, and the whole thing is an exercise in imperfection. Which is not to say it's meritless -- the protagonist and the plot live in my brain still, two years since I first read it.It can be found online, however, and even if it couldn't, thirty dollars is a bit steep for a piece like this. If you must get it, get all of his other published fiction first."
3,Cute...but thats about it.,"This is the first book I've read of Katie Maxwell's, and at first, I thought I was missing something really special. The opening scene pops, and I love the main character right away... but then throughout the book I feel like it starts to unravel, and by the end i was disintersted.Three stars."
2,An in depth book,"I bought and read Real World Illustrator 8 by Deke McClelland and Really enjoyed reading it. But I must say that I do not enjoy reading this book. In the preface of the book the authors explain how they learned a lot while writing the book and I just wish that they would have already had a good grasp of the whole concept before they began. The book tells you everything that you could possibly want to know about the program but it does not join it all together in a way that is easy to understand. If in fact you were to study the book really hard I have no doubt that you would master the program as the authors have, but you will have spent a lot of time doing it. I wish the authors would have stuck with one subject at a time instead of jumping around so much."
2,I believed the earlier reviews......,"This may not be the fault of the authors but I believed what I had read in a review on this page about the book being ""user-friendly for new users."" After going over the first 41 pages numerous times, I decided that if I wanted to get the Web site published in a timely manner, I needed to invest in another program and of course at least one more book. Since I'm not one to give up easily, I will purchase other books that are more friendly to new users to get me a better start with this program."
5,Positive,"The seller was very responsive when I let him know one less book shipped than ordered. Immediately he credited my account. Very nicely packed, true to condition of books (excellent), and plesant to order from on Amazon."
5,Read Teenagers and Heed,This has excellent Biblical principles that every teenager and (all) ought to pay attention to. This is written in simple understood language that goes along quickly yet full of good verses and summary. I am going to give it to my grandchildren.
3,George Reeves,"The best reason to watch this film is to catch a young George Reeves, ten years before Superman, in a small but pivotal part as a dashing young Mexican."
3,"Not great, but still some real good stuff","I agree that this effort does not approach the classic original cast recording with Mary Martin and Ezio Pinza -- and the chorus numbers on this recording are particularly bad -- but there is still much to commend it. Mandy Patinkin is very good (as usual), and Sarah Vaughn is a great, very original Bloody Mary (and is nearly worth the price of the album alone)."
3,a tenor as Emile de Becque?,"there is some beautiful singing here from te Kanawa, Carreras and Vaughan, but using a tenor in the role of the Frenchman, forces poor Mandy Pantinkin into a near-falsetto to distinguish his character as the star-crossed lover. I found the overall effect of his character lost on me, which wastes some great songs, and I usually think he's one of the greatest entertainers today."
4,Very good conditioner,"Very good conditioner, a little heavy for my hair so I would choose a lighter Aveda conditioner in the future."
1,"If you're interested in Epictetus, this is NOT the book for you.","If, on the other hand, you're interested in a handful of watered-down pithy sayings, ""interpreted"" (not translated) by a feel-good self-help maven who had never heard of Epictetus before her publisher approached her with this money-making idea, then jump right in!The author admits that she didn't even know of Epictetus before being asked to write this book and had reservations about what a ""dead white guy"" might have to offer her. She doesn't know ancient Greek, is unaware of the subtleties of his language, is ignorant of the historical events and schools of thought that shaped his thinking, regularly distorts his meaning and has produced nothing but a few little inspirational sayings.But hey, it sells.If you're not familiar with Epictetus, you will get a very distorted view of him through this book.If you are familiar with him, you will probably be horrified at the ways this book dumbs him down."
1,A Huge Disappointment,"I was hoping for an accessible Epictetus and instead I get ""Chicken Soup for the Stoic Soul"". If you're interested in understanding Epictetus, or Stoic thought in general you'll be sorely disappointed with this book. What's presented here is far better suited for a page a day calendar than a book (though given how meager the contents are, I doubt it would make it much past mid-summer)."
2,"pleasing, but hard care","When I purchase the playard it was a miracle...When my son was older it became sooo hard to clean!! I begged my husband for a new playard, because after one day I was cleaning the milk and cookies up. The stain wouldn't come out. The fabric can't be thrown in the wash. After scrubbing it by hand the soft material under the fabric bunched up. I could see the bottom of the playard. I don't use it, because I believe it will pose a threat for my son because he can lift up the sides and I'm afraid he'll slip and hit the metal underneat. Again, it's very very hard to clean!"
3,Not as good as the rest of the series,"We love the ""my first board books"" series - they really hold our 16-month-old daughter's interest, and she asks for them again and again. I was excited to buy the ""animals"" book, expecting it to be fantastic, but was disappointed to find that mixed in with the crisp, gorgeous photos that are a DK Publishing hallmark were a number of flat, uninteresting drawings of animals. Even animals that should have been easy to find photos of - wolf, penguin, pigeon - are represented by drawings instead. There are still plenty of great photos, but it's a shame that ALL the pictures aren't photos."
3,Too busy,"It's a good book, but there are too many animals on each page. The book is more for an advanced reader, rather than a beginner. A picture of a bird is sufficient, rather than 10 different types of birds and all the different names. Also, fyi, note the dimensions of the book, it's smaller than I thought it'd be."
4,Large variety of animals,"My First Animal Book contains dozens of colorful photographs of a wide variety of animals. A few of the images are nicely drawn illustrations. Animals are classified into groups such as babies around the farm, babies in the wild, birds, creepy crawlies, giant, etc. This provides plenty for a child to look at. The only downside is that some of the animal names are not going to be picked-up by the age group this book is targeted towards (e.g., cygnet, damselfly). But it is a great book for children to start to explore the wide variety of animals on the planet!"
4,Pretty good book......,"I agree with the other reviewers.... it's a good supplement to the Novell Documentation. The specific registry settings for the policies is a great reference, and tool to help you troubleshoot."
3,Caught Offguard,"Not what I expected. The earrings are nice, but they are soooo small compared to the photo. Totally caught me offguard when I opened the box."
2,Very disappointed in the color,"I was very disappointed in the purple color of the earrings when they finally arrived. The amethyst isn't the rich purple portrayed by Amazon. It's pretty washed-out looking. If I hadn't waited 2 months for them and if they weren't only $60, I would return them. However, under those circumstances, it would be more trouble than it's worth. I've bought other gemstones online and they were very true to the onscreen color. This is my first big disappointment."
3,Probably better in IMAX theaters,"I have several IMAX dvds and had high expectations about this new Blu-ray product. I especially liked the Ganges and Mysteries of the Nile productions and expected even better footage here since they were filming the Colorado River and landscape of the Grand Canyon.I think as a conservation film this was okay. However, if you are interested in landscapes and river rafting, I've seen so much better out there and I was disappointed in the quality and coverage. I have a new Blu-ray player and expected better from this film. I guess it loses something once out of the IMAX, 3D environment it was designed for. It almost seemed over-exposed. Too much time focusing on clever graphics. After all, this is the Grand Canyon - it is not needed and I found it slightly irritating."
4,Good nature film,Grand Canyon is a decent 3D nature film that explores the Canyon in 3D with good coverage. It does have some political overtones about the environment but nothing that is not tolerated in the spirit of the documentary type film. We purchased the film because it was in 3D and wanted a scenic documentary in our home collection. It was worth the price and is enjoyable to watch for the scenry and 3D action.
1,Tree Hugging Diatribe,Recommend putting TV on mute and playing background music unless you are looking for a lecture from a tree hugging leftist.
2,IMAX: Grand Canyon Adventure: River at Risk [3D] [Blu-ray],"Provides an adequate demonstration of the 3D feature on the new TV, but only during certain scenes. The narration is riddled with extremely one sided points of view that the Sierra Club would tolerate, but I hope the rest of us understand it to be pure propaganda. Not a total waste of money, but when we finish showing clips to the friends who want to see what 3D TV looks like: we'll be happy to part with the disc."
1,It product is not 3D!,"I don't know why you say that it blue ray is 3D because it is not true! I was expecting to see in 3D and my son too, but it is not 3D. I can't return this items because I'm outside of USA I'm in Colombia."
1,an environmentalist sermon..... waste of money,"A few years ago our family saw an IMAX 3D Grand Canyon film and it was amzing. I was hoping that this would be similar......It's not. It's an environmentalist wacko rant with contradictory statements and half-truths. There are only a few good 3D ""action"" scenes but they are spoiled by fear-mongering voice-overs. If you're the environmentalist type who thinks humans should have never inhabited the earth you'll love it. If you're looking for a scenic 3D tour of the Grand Canyon don't waste your money on this junk."
1,disappointed,"I bought this because it said IMAX and Robert Redford. But it turned out that another guy did most of the talking and there were just too many shots of his kid and not enough shots of the what I thought I'd be getting... namely the grand canyon.My own kids and my wife stopped watching it after 15 minutes. I watched to the end hoping that it might redeem itself but sadly it didn't. If anyone wanted to borrow it, I wouldn't mind if it was never returned."
2,Dissapointing,"I saw this in the Imax theater when it was first released.... a lot of people walked out in the first fifteen minutes.... It was loud, and mainly pop music which seem to get louder during the action scenes. The film would have stood on its own without the pop music, yet I suppose the producers decided it needed more ""flash"". The title should have been ""Adventures on the Colorado River"" as well."
4,Grand Canyon 3D,"Ive only seen a couple of 3d movies so far, but I truely enjoyed this one, I know its old, and kinda out dated but it was very cool. I thought the effects were good, afew were Great ! Very interesting ! bottom line I do recomment this 3d movie"
5,Best Introduction to Rook Endings,"This book is the best practical introduction to rook endings currently available. It should be useful for players rated anywhere from 1300 to 2300, but is probably targeted at average club players like myself, with a rating of 1800. While there are other rook endings books on the market - Nunn, Korchnoi, Smyslov and Levenfish, ECE - they're all rather esoteric and removed, to varying extents, from the concerns of a practical player. Emms gives one exactly what one needs to know. If one wants to pursue the subject further, one can consult one of the aforementioned tomes."
3,The Art of Listening Prayer...A Good Practical Tool,"It is exciting to think of what the church could accomplish if we truly spent time not only listening for God's voice in our daily lives, but actually doing what He asks of us!!! The Art of Listening Prayer is an excellent beginning tool for Christians who are interested in really learning how to hear God's voice. The book provides practical methods for focusing prayer time so that personal prayer time becomes more than simply a time of petitioning God for a list of needs and wants. For a well-rounded practical and scripturally based understanding of hearing God's voice, the interested reader would be well-advised to use The Art of Listening Prayer in conjunction with Blackaby's Experiencing God workbook."
4,Very challenging book!,"This book is definitely something worth looking into if you have trouble shutting out and being still. It's quite intensive, but it doesn't launch you over a cliff- rather it guides you step by step. I've found it very helpful."
1,Disappointing,"I like stories based on legend, but I don't sit around and read legends for a reason. I also prefer storylines not solely based on adultery. I know that probably doesn't mean a lot to some people out there, but Tristan's relationship with both Iseults was in some way adulterous and I have a lot of trouble admiring a hero who sees marriage as political only. Or maybe has so little control over his emotions that he stays in love with a woman he can't have. Definitely not my favorite Sutcliff."
5,Wow,"Great to see Ian as a young musician, even then the group had great skill and energy. Having watched them over the years, via DVD, its great to see a group who are serious about their craft. This is a great concert."
3,My high expectations were disappointed,"I read this book over 4 months and a number of subway rides (damn, it's heavy to read with one hand while holding on to a strap with the other!). As a big fan of Notes from the Underground, and having heard that this is the ""greatest novel of all time,"" I was very disappointed. I'm sorry, but the thing is just too long. Of course this no doubt reflects the serial economics of the day in which it was written, but I've read other long novels that use their length to much greater effect (yes, Dickens' Bleak House). There are bits that are really good (Grand Inquistitor, teachings of Zosima) but it was only in these that I found meaning--the rest of it was plot and a lot of bombastic speech from the numerous characters, none of whom I could identify with to any great extent. If you want Dostoevsky espresso (intense, but somewhat bitter flavor; quick intake), read Notes. Every sentence is necessary--unlike Brothers K."
4,Bothers Karamazov,Great book --compelling and one of Dostoyevsky's best. The conversation between Christ and the Grand Inquisitor is a passage for all human kind.
1,Snake oil peddaling at it's best.,"I'm surprised that this work is still in print. Basham capitalized on ""The Exorcist"" fame back in the 70's and apparently he's still milking it. He takes a few extreme psychiatric cases and puts his ""demon possessed"" spin on them and cleverly weaves stories out of them to convince the impressionable and gullible that demonic possession is real. Don't waste your time or money on this one."
1,i hate the feeling of being defeated,"i felt defeated reading the book, felt defeated for the characters, but most of all my wallet felt the defeat."
5,the best toy ever,I love it. it's so cool and fun. i love watching it grow and i love the games. it's much better than the first one
4,Marquis Truly Trinket Box,"I love this box. It is small, but very heavy for it's size. I ordered a used one so it has a few scratches on the bottom of it, but the rest of it is in perfect condition. I received it very promptly too. It would make a great gift for someone who is a crystal lover like me. I gave it four stars because of the scratches."
2,"All things considered, I'd rather have sugery....","...than wade through this book again. The biggest problem with this book is its utter lack of focus. The book is about a distinct, highly technical subject and yet the author subjects the reader to constant barrages of pointless quotations, humorless jokes, entire pages of brainteasers and puzzles that are only marginally applicable to anything in the text, yet all of which manage to break up and confuse the text. You could shave a solid hundred pages off the book and still have a book that better prepares you for your CNE exams than this one does in its current form. All of this, and the included software bites!"
3,Excellent but not organised for exam,"The good things about this book is that it has all the material the four CNE courses in one book. However, it's difficult to use this book to prepare for the CNE test due to the way this book is organised. Rather, if one can read this book from the beginning until the end, he/she is definately going to be better in handling Intranet design and implementation is a effective way.The imperfect being no ""Building Intranet With IntranetWare"" section in this book making it imperfect as a complete guide for CNE course.Also, the CD that come with this book is defective and until now I still haven't got back my replacemenet"
5,Wonderful All-Seasons Duvet,This duvet is extremely light and warm. It really saved me from catching a cold. The only downside of this comforter is that it is too comfortable that you would not like to get out of bed in the morning!
4,More Great Boogaloo!!!,"This is another great Boogaloo Joe Jones cd. I'd put it right up there with the two Legends of Acid Jazz cd's. The only problem is its hard to get, so people are charging a premium for it. For $20, I'd say definitely buy it. For $40, I'd say buy it if you have the two ""Legends"" cd's and you must have more. But I notice people are asking $100 and over for this one; and that is insane."
1,thinking about buying from samsung? think again!,"I've been through THREE Samsung players in the past year. Each time there's been a problem, Samsung has been reasonable about exchanging the unit for a new one, that is until the warranty ran out last month! Now I'm on my own! The battery latch is not designed well at all, and mine broke after a 1 foot fall. Also, the headphone jack isn't well soddered so the stereo sound keeps kicking in and out. And don't think you can get your YEPP player fixed if something does go wrong after your warranty expires, their ""service"" department simply replaces defective units under warranty and recommends that you buy another one if anything goes wrong afterwards! Talk about a company that won't stand behind its products!"
2,old news,"For those wishing guidelines and inspiration for a new direction in life, there are a number of better titles. The advice here is mostly recycled from other sources. The author uses the metaphor of ""re-packing your bags"" for discarding whatever's worn out or excessive or redundant in your life to facilitate moving on. The material is fairly low-key and soft-focus, not that useful. The book design and production was done on the cheap too, it seems."
2,Terribly disappointing,"Season 6 marks a real drop off in series quality - poor writing and non-committal acting, with a bitter undertone. You may want to avoid it. Lots of the dialogue is just nasty, with no pretense of being humorous. The Wanda character, especially, is now just mean, and everyone else, (writers, directors, actors), seemed to be mailing it in.We really enjoyed the previous seasons, but this season was not just not entertaining. It was so sour that it detracted from our fondness for the characters and for the earlier episodes. We finally tossed this season's DVD and agreed to pretend it didn't exist."
2,"too big, too bad","I ordered this for my guy, he's 6'1"" and 190lbs.... not a small guy and this watch was too big for him.... not the links, they can be removed, but the case is very big...too big. A great thing to remember.... if you don't know the model...buy it in a store! Save on shipping and TIME!!!"
5,The King Of Tone!,"This is an incredible musical journey. Landau, a top LA session ace, combines extraordinary writing and musical creativity with ""the tone of the gods!"" A must Cd for any serious Fusion lover."
3,More Hollywood Than Theater,"This is a decent movie, but it loses much of the power of the original play on which it is based because it takes many liberties with the original Agatha Christie mystery, including the invention of two scenes that are not in the original. While it is understandable that a movie is different from a play, this one changes much of the fundamental focus of the original drama, making it more about the defense lawyer than about the cunning con artist he is defending. In so doing, it becomes more Billy Wilder Hollywood than Agatha Christie theater.This video is out of production, so I bought one used through an Amazon partner store. The video was advertised as being in clean, as new condition, and that's how it arrived. It was delivered timely. I would give the vendor five stars for accurate advertisement and prompt delivery."
3,Cheesy by today's standards,"I agree that this movie is a prototype for countless future courtroom dramas, but that said, it wasn't too terribly exciting.Marlene Deitrich- icon at large- has always been a bit creepy to me- she's so cold- even when she's not supposed to be & don't get me started on her singing!I still like to watch films she stars in, because I believe one day I'll crack & understand what made her deeply sought after.If I had seen this in 1957, I'm sure I would have ooohed & aaahed at the twists aplenty, but they were lackluster in comparison to the many mystery books & movies I've read & seen.Most of it takes place in the courtroom- so I found I could just listen to it in the background without really paying attention to the screen.If you're interested in watching a film that helped make courtroom dramas what they are today, then you should check it out. I'm glad I watched it. Just don't expect to be thrilled beyond compare."
3,Not Wilder's Best,"This is a great mystery to be sure, but if you can't figure it out an hour and a half into the film, you ain't paying attention. I never got the allure of Dietrich, but Billy loved her. Okay, add an extra star for Laughton, the greatest ham what ever lived."
1,For collectors and historians only,"Compared to the introductory books on Go written by professional players such as Janice Kim, Kaoru Iwamoto and Cho Chikun (and my apologies to anyone I left out), this book falls short in every important way. Somewhere inside it is everything a first book on Go should have, but the presentation is tedious and windy.A century ago, this book and those like it were the only resources available to Westerners learning Go. Today, there are far better books on the market. Buy some of them."
1,Do not buy based on looks,"I bought this based on the hype created by the looks. The product is ok if you have super sensitive ears or use headphones like Bose QC2. If you use a volume level higher than 15, the battery drains in 2-3 hours. If you use @ volume level 15, it plays for 4-5 hours instead of the advertised 10 hours. I sent an email to their support on May 6th, still awaiting a response from them. If i do not hear in another week, I will post a complaint @ BBB.org.Please go for other players, my friends have them, no problems with their advertised features."
3,More gristle to chew on than meat,"If you want to learn about design patters, read ""Design Patterns Explained: A New Perspective on Object-Oriented Design by Alan Shalloway & James R. Trott"" (ISBN: 0201715945 ).This book does very little to explain anything to a level useful for neophytes; instead, it's got a few examples of how to use VB to implement a few of the more common design patterns. The best thing I can say about this book is that it's an easy (although light) read.Also, I had hoped that the CD would contain the text of the book itself (like the great Balena book, which I read more from CD than from paper because it's so useful), but the CD simply contains some sample apps that are marginally useful at best. (yawn)"
3,comparatively disappointing,"Compared with the meaningless trash published in the field of vampire fiction this third instalment of the serial shines brightly as a star but compared with the first two episodes it is disappointing, so much evident is the lack of real inspiration and polish that permeated the other two.First and foremost the writing is good but non as refined, subtle and tense as it used to be.I have loved Mr Schiefelbein's use of language too much not to feel that here it is professionally anonymous.Second, the plot is rather poor: the story of Victor and Paul hardly moves on and all we are left with is Paul's dislike for killing and the need for them to be apart.While reading I got the unpleasant feeling the author might have grown a little complacent depriving this third volume of the razor sharp edge of the first.I do hope the fourth volume will erase this feeling and am looking forward to reading it."
3,Not as good as the first two.,"I enjoyed this book because, over the course of the previous two books, I've grown quite attached to Victor the vampire. However, I didn't feel that this book was nearly as good, let alone as orginal, as the first two books in the series. It was just somehow lacking something that the other two had. It didn't have the heart (or the steamy-ness *LOL*) of the previous books. Luckily, the ending seemed to set it up for further books, so there is still hope that the series will be redeemed.I would say that anyone who has followed these characters needs to read this book, they won't regret it, but I wouldn't recommend it to someone unfamiliar with the series because it is not the best representation of the series."
5,Vampire Transgressions,"Supper, I wish there were more gay novels like this one. I like the way the characters interact with each other. The Author has a way of writing that makes you want to read the book from cover to cover in one sitting. That is, assuming ones eyes don't get tired from too much reading."
3,Not for the uninitiated,"The Kabbalah requires a great deal of contemplation upon messages hidden in its pages. In Mr. Matt's abridged version, we are given many things to ponder. However, not having read the Kabbalah in its entirety, one has to wonder if essential elements to understanding are missing. This title makes for short reading, and for those uninitiated, probably end up more confused than when you started. I would suggest for those who are beginning their investigation into Jewish mysticism, an annotated work would be more helpful"
4,good idea to get a warranty,"An excellent printer, good quality, decent print speed. I've had a little problem with it draining ink, but other than that, great item."
1,Not in the black.,"I installed USB ports into my Macintosh G3 (to attach this specific printer) and finally got the computer to recognize it.... only to learn that the printer wouldn't recognize its own black ink.It was nice that the printer came with two black ink cartridges (and the necessary cable), but the printer told me that both of them were empty.Thinking maybe this printer had a unique way of installing cartridges, I actually followed the intructions. Still the same thing happened.Then I found in their troubleshooting section that I likely had a damaged internal something or other.I assumed I got a lemon and immediately sent it back to Amazon with the idea of getting another one. But after reading the other less than stellar reviews of this product, I plan to look to another printer."
4,Good Performance - Perhaps not the idea cast...,"Good choreography, especially funny for I am a Pirate King.Good recording and video quality.One has to really wonder who chose the cast.Mabel, Janis Kelly, was great in the middle registers, but did not sing up into the stratosphere.Frederic, Alexander Oliver, could sing, but did not quite look the part of a dashing young lad of 21.General Stanley and Ruth were both fine.The Pirage King was not the strong singer that you would expect, but was clearly enjoying himself.Includes a libretto with almost all of the lyrics.It would have been nice if they had also included subtitles for those of us who can not resist the urge to sing along."
3,It Was Okay But It Could Have Been Better!,"I love the Pirates of Penzance and have seen other productions that were great but though not horrible this is far from perfect! Peter Allen wasn't the best Pirate King and not the greatest singer but his acting was good and was kind of enjoyable, I think what really bothered me about this production was that Frederic is 21 years old and the man playing him looked more like he was 51 years old and way to old to be playing a 21 year old, the woman playing Mabel looked kind of too old to be playing Mabel but at least she didn't look as old as the man playing Frederic and was somewhat more believable! There were some good performances from the people playing Ruth and Major Stanley and some good musical numbers with Mabel's sisters but I just could not get past the fact that the man playing Frederic was too old for the part and was badly miscast!"
4,the lesbian sex book,The Lesbian Sex Book was very helpful and it gave me a lot of info about being a lesbian. I would recommend this book to others.
3,Not exactly unbiased,"I had to get this book for a class on deaf culture. Sadly, the author comes off as hate filled towards hearing people, and maybe even towards himself for being deaf. It's like writing a book was his big chance to attack and accuse hearing people to his heart's content without anybody having the chance to contradict his anti-hearing propaganda. If you want a true, accurate insight into deaf culture without the ""Oh poor me and what I've endured"", skip this book and keep looking."
2,Just dont do it,"This movie was ok to pass the time, but if you are looking for a good movie with a well laid out plot or a movie that has some depth do it, look somewhere else."
4,If you are an Olyphant fan,"If you are a fan, you will like, if you aren't, you might not. I like Olyphant's style and he does the character justice"
2,so-so movie,"Ok,I didn't expect much when I bought this DVD so wasn't really surprised to find myself nodding off before the credits rolled.While not being familiar with the video game at all,I still have to question the casting of Mr Olyphant in the starring role.His face looks too ""pretty"" and sensitive for him to pretend to be a souless killing machine (the same applies for his turn as the main villain in DieHard 4).The plot is trying too hard to be twisty for it own good.Dougray Scott 's acting is too wooden,even worse than his turn in ""Desperate Housewives"".Lots of guns,yet abysmal ballistic knowledge from the screenwriters (a M203 is a grenade launcher,it doesnt shoot 7.62 bullets)Brief nude scenes with the leading lady are the movies only redeeming moments.Olga Kurylenko is a stunner.All in all,forgettable pop corn fluff."
2,Below average,I rented this movie because it had Timothy Olyphant in it. I love Justified and thought it would be a good choice. I have to say I did not really like this movie. I am not sure if I watched this too late at night because I never got involved in the story. I was a little lost at some points and didn't feel anything for the characters. Quick conclusion I should have went to bed instead of watching this.
2,This hitman is after everyone looking for him.,"Rated ""R"". Running Time: 92 mins.Based upon the Hitman Video Game series.A man, Agent 47 (Timothy Olyphant), who is shaved bald and tattooed with a barcode on the back of his head, is a hitman. He is after the very people who are after him. He wants answers as to why they are after him in St. Petersberg, Russia. The only person he can trust is Nika (Olga Kurylenko), a woman with a dragon tattoo by her eye and runs down to her cheek.Ever get the idea Timothy Olyphant should do the old Clint eastwood ""Dirty Harry"" movies?I can see why Olga Kurylenko was chosen for her role inQuantum of Solace [Blu-ray] (2008).Option of Language: English, Spanish. Option of Subtitles: English, Spanish, French.Video Game Series:Hitman: Codename 47(2000).Hitman 2: Silent Assassin(2002).Hitman Contracts(2004).Hitman: Blood Money for PC(2006).Hitman Absolution(2012)."
3,Good movie.,"I thought this was a good movie, not a must have. So, if you are on the fence about adding this to your Blu-ray library, rent it first. If you are one of the buy-and-watch enthusiasts, then you won't be too disappointed. There is a lot of shooting, dah, but not very much meaningful dialog. The other thing about the movie that seemed a let down was the ending. No spoiler here with details but it was just two obvious and there was no real building in intensity or suspense at the end. If it where not for the ending then this would be a 4 star. In my opinion this is a watch once type of movie."
3,Ghost stories of... where?,"The author admits that she is from ""the other side of the state"" in the Forward to the book. And having read it I did get the feeling that the stories being told were just be relayed by someone. The tales are all well written and entertaining, but they are missing that Pittsburgher feel.While the stories are interesting and do take place in Pittsburgh, I couldn't shake the feeling that these were generic ghost stories that could have the names and places changed to fit any city. I was looking for a book that captured some of the uniqueness of being from Pittsburgh. I was even hoping to see some of the stories I grew up hearing immortalized in print. This book didn't have any of that.If you are interested in reading some ghost stories that care be retold over a campfire then buy this book. If you are a homesick Pittsburgh native trying to connect to your city then skip this book."
4,It's ok,"The main reason I give this book a four instead of the three I would've otherwise granted is because I bought it for a dollar. Even if it had been awful, I'm not going to complain too much about my lost dollar.All in all the stories are alright. Some are pretty good, actually. Another reviewer here commented that the stories are too brief. Most barely making their way to a fourth page. And while I'll have to agree to that, I am also glad that the writer did not go overboard and scribble a bunch of superflous stuff about ""atmasphere"" and other such snares that tie-up many a book about ghosts.Obviously, if you live (or have lived) in Pittsburgh, this book will be more appealing for you. If you don't, then the locations will mean little to you, but some of the stories will creep you a bit. It's a good book to lay on the couch with on a snowy/rainy day. Which, I'd like to point out, is when book's are at their best."
5,Exactly what I needed.,"Not like all those flimsy decorator brackets. Exactly what I needed.Used together with the following:""John Sterling Fast Mount 300-Pound Capacity 11-Inch Shelf Bracket #BK... """"John Sterling Corporation BK-0100-4 4 Fast Mount Wall Standard """"John Sterling 0111-80 80"" Fast Mount Hang Track"""
1,long bracket,I was unhappy for the freight charge on this item when it was shipped with other items.
4,"left field, centered","Hanging five and walking the nose, Luke Solomon and Justin Harris go the edge, redefine left field. Musical antics supplied in plenty. Zany choices for their first mix compilation CD include artist: DMR, Doc L. Jnr, C++, Detox Twins, Easygoing, Hans Nieswandt, and Markus Nikolai. The thread of cohesion is a relentless bass as bottom. Choice cuts could possibly be Freaks own ""Turning Orange (Losoul Mix)"" and Deep Touch - ""Touchin' U"". Never to settle for complacency, Music For Freaks turn out different and ""out-of-kilter"" as a creative trademark. Lassoing musical nuances into an accessible whole, the end result is quite contagious. Catch it, buy your copy today, and enjoy."
5,an excellent and poignant portrayal of family interaction,"I thought this was an especially terrific book because it's topic, blended families, is so common to our 90's culture. I thought the best part about the book is that EVERY character had flaws. Tess' mother, whose point of view was the most represented in the story, was not perfect. She made mistakes. And Peter, the husband, was not ""the knight in shining armor"". He was a good man, but had faults, as well. This story showed family life, warts and all. Additionally, Ms Robinson did a good job in narrative, by subtly building up suspense for an impending tragedy. Great book!"
2,Gee...,"I just viewed this film. Very difficult to follow what's going on. I did like the bad acid trip viewing perspective, but did not understand what statements the movie was attempting to make.blood addiction= drug addiction?. Black people in white society struggle internally? Who knows?"
2,Terrible for the neck - ok for the face,"I've had this for 4 months and should have returned it after the trial period. It is just worthless at shaving neck hair. Even if I shaved twice a day, it doesn't even touch them. I have to pass over and over again to get any and then my skin is quite irritated. My only success with this razor on my neck is to use the beard trimmer which has it's own issues.It works just fine on the face but nothing special. I still have to take a few passes. It does seem well constructed and packaged well. I wish my original Norelco had as nice of a case. I was hoping the Braun would do a superior job on my neck but I'm sad to say, it is far worse. I'll have to keep looking for something that works."
5,Braun electric razor,I'm a big fan of the Braun electric razor. I've been using this brand for well over 15 years and I am completely satisfied. I didn't realize how much better the new models were until I received the Braun 8975 for Christmas this past year. It works much better and requires much less time to get a good shave. Would highly recommend this product to all that were looking for an electric shaver.
4,Herriots Yorkshire,Nicely done. Photographs and comments on theareas covered. Very personal account by Herriotof his travels. You feel as if you traveled withan old friend.
2,Quality has really slipped -- too flimsy for most uses,"These Bankers Box/Fellowes magazine file holders are too flimsy for use with a heavy load of magazines. A side-by-side comparison with older magazine holders this company produced over the past several years shows that cardboard in the new holders is about half as thick.I feel it's way too much money to spend for these new file holders when they are simply not likely to last and may fall apart with continued use.Please note the older reviews of this product are quite positive -- when the quality was there with heavier cardboard. In my opinion, such reviews are NOT relevant today -- particularly with the apparent slip in quality. In fact, the most recent review agrees with this assessment -- these new Bankers Box/Fellowes file holders are too flimsy. Look elsewhere if you need something sturdy."
2,They do what they are supposed to...,"Nothing more, I don't expect them to last. I wish I had bought the plastic ones.... I have mine set up to hold woodworking and automotive magazines in my garage workshop. I am concerned the humidity might do the cardboard in quickly. Then again, it's probably not all that good for my magazines..."
2,too flimsy,Need to put tape on these to make them sturdy and strong enough. liked the blue colored glossy finish ones better.
4,Romantic,"I liked this movie; sweetly romantic with a bit of a twist: two artist friends (straight woman, gay man) are trying to be sophisticated and avoid any hint of having real feelings in any of their relationships. But whoops! They really do want feelings and one of them ends up with them, despite trying to deny it. Personally, I think there's a hint that both of them end up with them, but the story stops before that can be developed unfortunately. The biggest problem is that this dvd is the worst dvd I've ever rented: no menus and it's got a &*^%&^%$^&*%^&%!!! intro with ads for other movies that you can't skip. Fortunately my DVD player would let me fast forward over it, but if this weren't such a good movie, I wouldn't buy it."
2,Small capacity--needs service in less than 1 yr.,"I bought this dishwasher with the idea of being able to use just the top drawer for most days, when it is just my husband and me. And that is the one good thing about it, and I think it does clean better because there is only one rack for each spray arm. Large dinner plates don't fit in either drawer. Tall glasses don't fit anywhere, same with deep cereal or salad bowls, unless you can get away with only putting 3 in there. The silverware basket came apart when I was carrying it to the drawer to put away, and clean flatware went all over the floor. My husband epoxyed the thing together so it wouldn't happen again. There is no sani- cycle, which I think would be a real asset, with grandchildren / pets in the household. Today it started flashing an error message, that translates into ""the flood switch has been activated, call service center"" Great! it is not even filled with water, and both dishwashers are in failure mode..."
3,medium roast,better than average coffee but not bold enough for my taste! I definitely prefer Emeril's Big easy Bold!
3,Not bad - for K cups,"We've had a K cups coffee brewer for two years and this is the best coffee we've come across so far. In general the brewer produces weak coffee, even if one selects the 'small cup' size. Tully's Italian and French Roasts partially overcome this with a bold roast or perhaps just more coffee per cup. On a scale of 1 - 10 where 1 is a cup of Folger's crystals and 10 is cup of Starbucks coffee brewed on a Clover, this comes in around a 6 or 7. Not fantastic but very drinkable."
3,Very easy to install...don't see what the fuss was about,"When i use the camera with face tracking option switched on, it just doesn't track my face or itll stay on my face and then suddenly move a lil higher to the fan and im out of the area...can be very very annoyin at times"
1,HATE IT,Overpriced! This thing only works when it wants too and I am sick of it! Stay away. I will never buy another webcam from Logitech.
2,Kind of disapointing,"They really tried to ""take advantage"" of a DVD's unique capabilities (that might have been impressive 10 years ago), but really they just made everything more complicated than it has to be. All I wanted was some good test patterns and such - which this has - but you have to wade through a lot of junk. If you're somewhat technically capable and already know what some of this stuff means, it will be very frustrating."
3,no rating yet,Haven't had time to view it yet. Too busy with other projects to sit down and view it yet. Let you know later. However it arrived on time undamaged. I'll have to let you know later.
3,OLD But Effective,"If you can get past the 10-15 year old take that the narrative has on the whole digital television industry, this tool has many useful features for calibrating your HDTV."
2,Not This One,"Just a friendly heads-up for fellow guitarists/Robben Ford emulators; this one's not the best choice for instructional efficacy. I found it to be way too choppy and without focus. ""The Blues and Beyond"" Instructional DVD, followed by ""Playin' The Blues"", are my personal favorite Ford tutorials. Truth be told, his Live Paris concert DVD is well filmed and yields great insight to attentive viewers/listeners/players who yearn to wallow in the delicious Ford flavor. The man is a great player and a good teacher, but this disc is far from his finest product."
3,Me and Julio Down by the School Yard,"I bought this Album Just for this Song. Really... You can't find it on any Albums that are available. I was mifted when it wasn't on Simon & Garfunkels Greatest hits. The Song Set is pretty decent and most recognizable.F.Y.I.I trust the songs go well with the movie, I never saw it.Why 3 Stars, I just feel highest marks are to be given to ""One Band"" soundtracks that are really good. Not to Movie song collection soundtracks, just cause we really liked the movie it went with."
4,Great Mix of Songs,"I got this CD because of the Glen Lewis song. Now, because of the broad mix of music, including the instrumentals, it has become my favorite."
5,awesome,i had this game years ago and lost it. it is a very difficult game to find and couldn't believe i found it here. it is a very fun game and i just love it.
4,Essential Reference on Our Allies Spying on US,"One hundred billion dollars annually is one White House estimate of the cost to U.S. businesses imposed by economic espionage carried out predominantly by our allies-France, Israel, Germany, South Korea, and Japan being among the top culprits. Peter Schweizer was the first to really put this issue on the table, and he deserves a lot of credit. Neither Congress nor the Administration are yet prepared to take this issue seriously, and this is a grave mistake, for in the 21st Century information is the seed corn of prosperity, and our allies are eating our seed corn."
1,Teeth snap in 58 y/o w thin fine hair,"I can't believe I'm reviewing a comb. But the teeth snap off while coming thin, fine, straight hair on my near 59 y/o scalp. Outrageous."
5,Very emotional band !,"Hopesfall is sure one emotional band with not only beautifull melodis but also brutal killer riffs that i will always love and i can't realy get enaugh of these genious known as hopesfall ! ""No wings to speak of"" is a must have if your into original and a very difirent type of metalcore... I would recommend this for you ! The best song here ? "" end of an era"" Gotta love that song and i sure do ! If you into amazing music buy it, what you waiting for ? Peace !"
1,Save yourself! Don't buy this phone!,"I had to return this corded phone (I thought it was cordless, but that was my own fault) because the clarity of sound was sooo terrible. The people on the other end sounded muffled and fuzzy. This simply is a bad phone and once again proved the old axiom true -- ""you get what you pay for."""
5,Bolling Spreads His Wings,"With this, the second in a series of jazz-classical fusion collections, Bolling has reached new heights. Every single piece is refreshingly original - no repeats are duds in this collection.The style and expression are both freer and more intense - indeed this seems more ""musical"" in many ways. Once again it is almost impossible to select a ""favorite"" although JAZZY and AMOURESE are two that stand out. The sound is sheer perfection but it is the inventive aspect of the series that makes this collection shine."
3,A good yarn based on a selective reading of outdated theories,"This is an intriguing book, but the scientific theories it is based upon were discredited decades ago. The mass extinctions and climate shifts Graham gets so much mileage out of are better and more simply explained by current models.The comparative analysis of primitive cultures is what I found most interesting. Though perhaps this book isn't the best summary I could have chosen, since so much of it is drawn from newspaper articles of the 1960s.It was a fun read, it just isn't science."
2,Hancock lacks insight and knowledge.,"The topics covered in the book are nothing new - who built the Great Pyramid and how, pyramids and huge stone monuments in South America, Hapgood's theory of shifting of earth crust, etc. They have been covered before, and covered more effectively.What's most unfortunate about this rehash is that Mr. Hancock does not seem to possess enough technical or scientific knowledge to speculate and ask intelligent questions on any of the things he sees on his extensive (must have been expensive, too) trips. All he does is to repeat what's been speculated in the past, without offering any new perspective. When he muses about ancient myths, he doesn't offer any poetic inspiration either, the way Joseph Campbell did. It's plain that he is indeed interested in these topics, but if you look for his answers to these enigmas, there is none. The whole thing should have been a travelogue, nothing more."
1,Nonsense,"There is so much wrong with this book that it's hard to know where to start. It's not bad as a travelog (Hancock does write well, if rather breathlessly), but as a supposed argument about the past, it's complete trash. Every single outmoded, out-of-date, discredited argument you've ever heard about the past is dragged into play, kicking and screaming: the Nazca lines, the Maya, the Olmecs, the Flood myth, precessional ""archaeo-astronomy,"" the Pyramids -- you name it, it's here. It's as if all these subjects had not been done to death in previous maverick ancient-history theories (ET built the pyramids, Atlantis, Velikowski, and so on) and long, long rejected by any thinking reader.In short, nothing new here. Just more of the same nonsense. Don't waste your money."
4,Love it,"Roxas is one of my favourite characters from Kingdom hearts, and i am so glad i got it, it is in perfect condition which i am happy with :D And it looks exactly like him, i plan on getting Sora soon and of course i'll be getting it from this seller :D"
5,Great Product,I just bought this last week and have only used it once. It works beautifully. It's amazing how much of the juice it actually gets out of the lime. I read a review on the lemon squeezer and it said that over a year the enamel started to peel away. Maybe it needs to be cleaned immediately after use. I'm planning on buying the one for lemons also.
2,Hinge Broke first day.,The device worked well for the first couple of limes that I squeezed. However it did not last because hinge broke after a few limes. The hinge is essentially a rivet and that rivet is not able to withstand the force you apply when attempting to do a thorough job of extracting the juice. The basic design is sound but the build quality needs to improve. Especially as it applies to the quality of the metals used in the hinge. I'm going to fix the hinge and it should last longer in the original.
3,its alright for the price,"afraid I can't get worked up about a big hunk o' plastic. it does the job, and well, and was a good value for the price. The darned thing is bigger by half than it sounds like (my 15"" laptop rattles around in there pretty good if I don't strap it down tight, and it BARELY fits in my huge backpack) but otherwise, a sage way to spend your 21 bucks."
3,Just OK,It does the job but isn't anything super. I would prefer neoprene. In the end I purchased a Manhattan Portage bag that has a neoprene sleeve built in. This case works for me when I put it in any other luggage.
1,Soft Porn in a Sci Fi wrapper,"I rented this movie (thank God I didn't buy it). Plot - rehashed and borrowed from so many other movies. Acting - I don't think there was any. Monster - worst than the worst Godzilla suit.In between the lesbian shower scene (OK this scene wasn't too bad) and actress(?) JJ North humping on top of McQueen on an operating table there is supposedly a Sci Fi movie about an altered human trapped in a science facility in post apocalyptic earth. Eventually everyone starts getting picked off by the Hybrid.It's just bad...In addition you get tips from the director before the movie on how to get girls to take their tops off so plenty of breast shots.Bottom Line: plenty of T&A;, no acting, old, tired plot..."
5,one epic tray!,"I have two of these. They are quite large and heavy- as large as a TV tray. If you drop one better tuck in your toes!This tray is large enough to hold the biggest turkey and all its garnishes and you can still see the elegant pattern around the edges. I've put these in the oven to make nachos and I've baked biscuits on them. Being a very large piece it stays hot for a very long time -long enough to burn your fingers after the nachos are gone.A tea set looks very fine on this tray and it's deep enough to contain the biggest spill. If you are fortunate enough to locate an Armetale tea set the only thing lacking would be the butler.This piece is so beautiful that if you have a buffet or sideboard you'll want to display it on a stand when you're not using it.The nice thing about Armetale is you can mix the classic styles in your collection or if you prefer contemporary, there are a number of styles to mix and match as well."
3,"Two for One, but really just one","The bottom basket does not slide out. It's handy having the two baskets to put those odd and end things. But since the bottom basket doesn't slide, its more or less having a shelf on top."
1,not good,"i can't manage to put the top thing perfectly in place on the body. not a sturdy product, can't really slide it"
3,Could have used a better editor,"There's some great information here, and the authors present the fruits of some painstaking research into Leadbelly's early life. We find out the true story behind his prison stints (and escapes) and releases. We also learn about a possible ultimate source for Goodnight Irene. The stories of Leadbelly's experiences with the Lomaxes are much more detailed and richly told because Lomax wrote many letters and kept an extensive record of his travels with Leadbelly.But a more attentive editor could have helped a great deal. For example, two dates for Juneteenth are given. Bruno Hauptmann's name is misspelled. Some clunky phrases are repeated within a paragraph of one another. The chronology of Leadbelly's trips around the Northeast is muddled and hard to follow at times. The information is all there, and it is great to read all about it, but it could have been much more clearly presented."
2,Cheap,The interlocking pieces are constantly coming apart but my girls love it anyway. Not a quality toy that will last for years and in my opinion not worth the cost.
2,be careful,"While the info in this book is mind blowing and given under the guise of love, please, please, please do not ever ask your guides to step aside."
5,about this book!! ( Kyon),"How would you rate this book should you base it upon living in humanity and life it self? should this book take a part of everyday living expereinces amongst any heart, body, mind, or soul? Would you make this book an everyday accurance to humanity? should people take this book and use it like profaned tv shows would take action in the way that they would act, what i mean is would this be influence on humanity, and would it be positive or negative? my name is Tony the other question is by eric at the same email address."
3,Re: Detail and Typos,"I have to follow-up with the previous review. Having been given this book for my birthday by my kids, I was instantly drawn in by Bowden's immense research. However, I also was appalled by the large number of typographic errors, grammatical errors, and use of slang in referring to the sergeants and corporals as ""noncomms"" instead of as non-commissioned officers. I served in the U.S. Army for 20 years and always called them by either their rank or by the term non-commissioned officers (or its abbreviation - NCOs). I also wonder how much error has crept into the amazing appendices. But I guess we'll never know until someone goes and checks out the French archives originals. Otherwise a useful book on this oft neglected campaign."
5,My favorite Norah Lofts book,And that's saying a lot! I read this a LONG time ago and recently found another copy. It was even better than I remembered it being. One of the best novels about Anne Boleyn I've ever read. And I've read a lot of them!
3,A Good Book for Anne Boleyn Fans...,"A number of reviewers have said that they have read everything they could about Anne Boleyn. I have done the same. I was quite thrilled to find this book, and really enjoyed Norah Lofts opinion of the events surrounding this facinating woman's life. I would also recommend ""The King's Pleasure"" by the same author. This is about the life of Katharine of Aragon, and as can be supposed, fleshes out Lofts' view of this time period. Personally, I agreed with most of Lofts' conclusions about the people and events of the early 16th century. I also highly recommend Robin Maxwell's ""The Secret Diary of Anne Boleyn"", Margaret Campbell Barnes' ""Brief Gaudy Hour"", and Jeane Plaidy's ""The Lady in the Tower"" & ""Murder Most Royal"". All are fictional accounts of Anne Boleyn that are extremely well done."
4,Notturno,"A neat soundtrack to the spy flick starring Tony Musante (The Bird With The Crystal Plummage) with elements of progressive rock and new age, along with the occasional nod to the James Bond theme. The seven takes of the title track have various themes with different instrument colorings that never makes it boring. A worthy addition."
4,Fascinating and entertaining,"This is an absolutely delightful and fascinating synthesis of geological,astonomical and archaelogical evidence. It is a bold attempt to debunk the conventional and traditional view that the structures on the Giza plateau are only the funerary tombs of dead kings. By publishing the book in popular motif, Hancock and Bauval have succeeded in breaking through the arrogance and stuffiness of heavy structured academic form and argument and this makes the book entertaining and wonderful to read. I appaud the authors in not reaching too far into the speculative and sticking to the evidence through a multi-discilinary synthesis. I'm looking forward to Hancock's new book on his on-going quest for lost civilisations. The two authors make a wonderful team."
3,Interesting but dry,"This book presents well thought out explanations for they pyramids, Sphinx, and other Egyptian monuments. The book bases most of its conclusions on astronomical data and alternative interpretations of Egyptian texts.Any reader should be forewarned that the book relies heavily on math. Even though the book is well illustrated, I found the presence of so much math and astronomical data to be overwhelming and not in the least bit interesting. Many of the Egyptian texts presented don't translate very well to English, and the authors often present 3 meanings for 1 word or phrase.I thoroughly enjoyed ""Fingerprints of the Gods"", but this book doesn't really go far enough. At the end (and this gives a lot away), we find that the authors do believe the pyramids were completed around 2500bc (as conventional Egyptian history holds). There really isn't anything here that is revolutionary."
2,Counterfeit Legacy,"While this book is a page turner, my objection to this book is the suthor's heavy-handed approach of the abortion issue. This is not apparent in the beginning of the book but becomes so the farther one reads the book. I was NOT expecting it from this book by the descriptions that I had read. It is rather disingenuous of the author to hit the reader over the head with a 2X4 concerning her views on abortion without being ""up front"" about it."
2,Don't believe the hype.,"What a disappointment this was. Sure, there are a few good songs (Moscow Snow, She's Jive, Hey Little, and maybe Stick with It). Those 4 are somewhat Shins styled songs and are fairly good. But, the rest is just dreck. The second half of this cd has 4 songs (Product, Playful Partner, Cards, and Candy Arse) that I defy anyone to say anything good about. I'm always mystified at groups who obviously know how to write decent songs, but for reasons unknown choose not to."
5,Excellent for Small Businesses,"I have read some unfair reviews on this machine. I say unfair because I love it. I own a 9/11 Museum in Manhattan and just purchased this. It make copies very fast, has a paper feed table that is unbreakable because of the crutch that was ingeniously created below it (our last one broke) and we have faxed up to 30 page docs for billing at a time without the machine getting jammed. So, I don't know what all the fuss is, unless you have a large business that demands major copy machine output. It is a good machine for the money and we have no problems with it. -GMS www.GroundZeroMuseum.com New York City"
2,minimal,"Brother 7820N:1. Cannot reliably print envelopes, including and especially #10. If that's important to you, find another machine.2. Scan for fax very slow. VERY slow. Interminable.3. Software minimal, very poorly designed. Fax and scan management thin, missing functions and management options.4. Support (help; manuals; online) incomplete, inaccurate.5. Will not automatically re-set after paper jam clear. (Have to power cycle.)Everything about the machine says ""absolute minimum""--fit, function, design, engineering, materials, assembly, software (incl driver).A reasonable guess: Brother put the machine out there to hit a price point. Sold a bundle of them on the strength of early reviews."
5,Astonishing,"I picked this book up only 2 days ago and I'm extremely glad I bought it. This book may seem very wild to some, but to me it's like a bible of life! It answered a lot of questions I had been asking myself for years and I really recommend others read this book as well. It's very interesting and fun to think about even if you don't believe any of it. It still gives you something to think about!"
1,Snore,"Nothing in this book is true but it is a comprehensive new age/rebirthing/early 90's generic unified theory of kookiness. The reason this book seems original is because Bob did combine a lot of strange information here, but didn't add much to the mix. Is NASA hiding things on Mars? I think so. Is there a devious secret government? Yes, but you'll find a lot more accurate info elsewhere on these subjects. I recommend Bob's companion volume Something in This Book is True instead of this because it has a much more personal touch and at least Something true."
5,Pretty picture and very sturdy,"I bought this as a gift for family to quickly identify their luggage during an upcoming trip to Japan. The tag is unique and pretty. I love the plastic insert in the back for identification information. This product suits my needs perfectly, is sturdy, and should last many years."
2,Shooting Blanks! - I'm Selling Mine,"This is my first Flower King's album and may very well be my last. The band is very talented musically no doubt, but the songwriting displayed on this album is very disappointing. I keep trying to find something I like on these two discs, but even the instrumentals are just close to being good but never quite win me over. My apologies to all the FK fans out there, but I will be selling my copy of this tepid work. - Ciao"
4,Funny Classic,"This is one of the few movies that I can watch more than once. It is one that I enjoy very much and I consider it a classic. Having said that, I cannot give it the full 5 stars because although it was very good, I would not call it a rating of perfection."
5,Excellent restrospective of a legendary singing group.,"This a great review of the Supremes and their rise to stardom through their TV appearances. Watching the group change over the years (hair, makeup, clothing, etc.)was fun see but seeing the smoothing of their performances, was close to fantastic. Great for the collector."
3,somewhat disappointing,"seems like there must be gobs of better footage out there. is it all copywrite protected? the live songs are good, but too many lip-synched versions, and the extras are just a rehash. too bad the us version had only one disc, while the brits got two. that's crazy. love to watch the dynamics between the three girls, knowing the tense personal relationships that they had. required reading: ""Call Her Ms. Ross."""
1,Very poor quality of video production,I saw bits and pieces of this video on PBS and was very excited to get it. Once I received it though there are blank spaces and missing commentary as shown on PBS. The quality is very poor and with the technology we have today I expected a much better put together video.I would not recommend this video at this time unless it is redone and remastered with improved technology.
5,Another great Motown collection; keep 'em coming!,"I've got this disc focusing on the Supremes, along with the Marvin Gaye and Temptations discs. This is what a music DVD should be! Despite the valid criticisms raised in other reviews about audio and video quality, these discs are nevertheless very enjoyable. I sure hope that Motown will release video collections of the Four Tops and Stevie Wonder...and that the success of these discs will encourage the release of other DVD's focusing on complete vintage performances of other artists from the 50's, 60's and 70's, including the Everly Bros., Little Richard, Aretha Franklin, the Rolling Stones, Small Faces, the Kinks, James Brown, etc."
5,Supreme!!!,"For whatever reason Diana Ross's work has been keep out of the spotlight for way to long. All those great Special's ""An Evening With"" comes to mind as well her first special in 1971. This dvd recalls some great clips from the 60's and those 12 number one songs that made me first fall in love with Diana Ross. We can only hope this is JUST the start!"
5,The Best Documentary Yet,"When won't they release this damn thing on DVD? VHS is so outdated and it sucks. This really is Queen's best doc right now. The clips are really great and the interviews are really good. They start right from the beginning of Queen and go on until Freddie's death. Buy this, you won't be sorry."
2,All the makings of a B movie!,"Bad acting, dumb plot, Naked chicks and a demonic cartoon monster that is released from what looks like the book of the dead and possess one of the girls, than goes on a killing spree to free other toons from the book. somewhat entertaining to watch, is it so bad its good? well, there we're parts I laughed at, mostly the bad acting but all in all its really lame stuff."
4,A fun game for fellow tycoon lovers.,"Although nowhere as good as Rollercoaster Tycoon, this game, with a few good patches, and some added scenarios, could be a winner. The makers of this game could learn a few things from Chris Sawyer, but they're on the right track. It's another game that you can play for hours, and the best thing is, is that you don't even have to know how to ski to play the game! For the price, it's not a waste of time. However, I would like to see Activision offering some information about it on their website. Give it a try if you like this sort of game."
2,Poorly made game,"This game was very poorly made and the graphics were terrible. There is really nothing to be done in this game. It looks like a fun game on the cover of the box, but don't be fooled.As mentioned earlier, if you want a fun game try Roller Coaster Tycoon or The Sims. Something that actually maks your mind think. Ski Resort tycoon is a rip off, please don't make the same mistake I did. I wasted [good $]."
1,Good Try,"First of all, I thought it was by Hasbro like RCT, but it's not, it's by Activision. I have a pretty good computer with 42 Gig, and it says that I have insufficient memory to play. If you know that it will work on your computer buy it, but I don't know if it is a very good game."
3,A good game if you're bored to death.,"I bought this game for twenty dollars. All that came in the box was the cd in a paper envlope. I expected that for such a cheap game. The game came loaded with different buildings, ski lifts, and other structures. Only problem is that to unlock the better buildings, you need to build the more basic structures first. This may seem okay. Its the driving force in the game, but it takes forever to get the good buildings. You start off with $50,000 in easy mode. Building a few building and a ski lift will put you into debt. Now its time to make money. It'll take you at least half an hour to make $10,000 back, and then you spend that money on a new condo and your back in debt. Graphics are good, but the music is horrible. You can only hear it when you zoom out. Overall, turn the game on, leave town for a few days, and then you'll have enough money to play."
3,It's OK,"It talkes about a day to tire of this game. It has some interesting ideas, but can easily be mastered by anyone with any sim experience. The graphics are good, not great. I guess my biggest complaint is that it is very predictable and there are no surprises. The concept is a good start. Like real Ski resorts, they should require designing summer activities as well. Have said that, I still was glued to the computer for 8 hours and I will go back and play it once in a while. The code is questionable as I have had 2-3 times times when the screen freezes up."
3,Interesting medical case and criminal case too,"""Face blindness"" is what the main character is left with after escaping a killer on the street and banging her head while falling into the water during her escape. She cannot recognize even her friends' faces as a result, and the killer knows it. She enters into a relationship with the lead detective as well, and there are some twists that occur as a result of this. Interesting tale."
3,tepid thriller,"This tepid thriller struggles with plot holes and devices and a premise which makes for challenging film making. I thought Milla Jovovich's performance was good, but she struggled to add weight to a story and just didn't justify it. Particularly miscast was her love interest, further weakening an already shaky storyline. The ""reveal"" was easy to see coming and lacked much surprise or impact."
5,This is it. Allan Nation,"It is outstanding that we are still reluctant to understand the proper use of grazing, The author is the original founder of ""rational grazing"" (1957 !!)and even for other non-temperate areas it is still a classic worth reading and rereading, not for nothing is the basis of Holistic Range Management by Savory."
5,Awesome gift unique find,"Got this on an AMazon deal. So cute and will make a nice gift. Great collectible cause its so small, wish I had gotten one for myself too!"
3,"cute, but...","I'd expected more fancy one than this one. Its idea - kittens rounding in a small match box - was not bad, but the boring melodies - only two or three bars - repeat forever. It's a little bit cute though."
4,LIghtweight MP3 Player That Sounds as Good as it Looks!,"This lightweight MP3 player is easy to use and sounds great. Although at 32 MB, it only plays about 25 minutes, Samsung has a rebate offer for a second 32MB card for free, giving you about an hour's worth of tunes.The player looks great, drawing rave comments from friends who want to check it out. It's easy to use and the headphones sound better than I expected. It is really small but easy to control with the buttons.We are very satisified with this purchase. Several friends bought it after trying the Yepp and had the same experience."
4,Great deal!,"After a *LOT* of research I bought my first MP3 player.It is a very good deal, specially if you buy the 32Mb version an add an unexpensive 64 Mb smartmedia card. 96Mb is fairly more music than the one you'll need for a ride on the bus to college or work.The sound is pretty good and you'll usually use it on shuffle without the remote. I don't have to say anything about the look.The software works ok, you'll probably preffer the Yepp explorer (downloadable from samsung's site) than the included Real Jukebox.About the transfer speed, well, when working with the embedded memory is just fine, however, downloading or even erasing music from the smartmedia is kinda' slow.To sum up, if you get it from less than 100 bucks... it's a really good deal."
2,Just OK,"The cartoons are what you would expect, over and over. Maybe worth a few bucks for the historical/social viewpoints, interesting to see what used to be acceptable (more to some people than to others), but repetitive and quickly boring."
4,Ipod arm band,"I use the arm band daily during my workout. My only problem with this product is the closer are strap. Although comfortable, it tightens on a kind of a slide. I didn't like that feature so I sewed on velcro and now I like much better. I have washed it in the washing machine and it came through just fine. Just remember to air dry it!"
4,Great for the treadmill or walking outside.,I love this armband. It makes listening to my iPod so much easier and it stays in place. I use it while walking anyplace.
4,Simple yet effective,"This product is just what you'd expect, but not in a bad way. It serves it's design and purpose well. The clip to hold the headphone wire is particularly nice and efficient.The only slight annoyance is a slip-type adjustment system for tightness around the arm as opposed to velcro or another type of system. I wasn't expecting it, but it's fairly intuitive to get the hang of. All in all, you'll get what you want, if this is indeed it. The Open View Armband is well designed and serves its purpose well. Not a bad investment, especially considering its low price."
4,Cool,"I like the carrier, however it lacks an explanation of the design so I can know where to plug things through. Otherwise its grrrrreat."
4,This stuff is fun!,"This is a great game however with one issue in my case, when i had on both my mac and pc, at one point my home screen shrunk down on the sides so my screen in smaller like it it in the game. Other then that though its fun as a game you play every now an then. or all the time. one or the other."
2,"Great game, bad code","I picked this game up cheap and have been playing it on my dual 1.8 G5. It's a fun game, very similar to Warcraft III but it has major crash issues with dual processor machines. There is nothing worse then playing a strategy game for 2 hours to have it crash on you and lose everything. And the sad part is it crashes more then not. Macsoft support is nil, in-fact there is a patch for this game and all three locations linked on the Macsoft webpage to down load the patch are dead. Even for 15 bucks I would have to pass on this game, not worth the crashing and lost time. I am very disappointed they do not put some effort into porting there games to OSX."
3,You're better off buying the Folies Bergere video...,"Since the price on this video is so good and because your purchase supports the Bellydance Superstars franchise, I recommend buying it...However, about half of the performances can be seen on the Bellydance Superstars at the Folies Bergere video but with twice the energy. If you're a fan of Tamalyn Dallal and Rania then maybe you'll find this video of interest as they are not featured in the other Bellydance Superstar video. I found Rachel Brice's second performance to be of particular interest because it's unlike anything else you can see her do on any of her other Bellydance Superstar performances.The camera angles suck, the close-ups are ridiculous and all in all this video falls far short of my expectations but it is an interesting addition to your collection of bellydance dvds nonetheless."
3,"Great dancing, terrible filmwork.","The cameraman went on vacation and was replaced with interns. Choppy filmwork, roving cameras, a plant in the way obstructing the view, close ups of the drummers instead of the dancer and the digitized background make this a decent DVD but you may need a dramamine afterwards to soothe your jostled stomach.However, the dancers are fantastic, and if you can tolerate the swinging camera, it's an essential. If the cameras in Blair Witch Project made you ill, see the live version instead."
4,A fascinating account of the life of Christ,"""The Aquarian Gospel of Jesus The Christ"" was originally recommended to me 10 years ago. I have read and reread it several times. I must say that on my first reading (especially the introduction) I found it hard to believe. However, the content of the book ""felt right"" and that is the only way I can describe it. As the years have past and I have encountered other books on spiritual matters I find that ""The Aquarian Gospel of Jesus The Christ"" makes so much more sense to me and has become one of the staple books in my spiritual Library. Many may have a hard time believing what this book has to say because it gives no evidence that it is truth, but to quote Pontius Pilate ""What is truth?"", I believe we must each listen to that quiet voice from our hearts for the answer."
5,"Sadly, a gem well hidden away.","A well-read friend recommended this book over 10 years ago, and I put-off getting it and reading it till now. All I can say is WOW. I am familiar with the Akashic records (ala Edgar Cayce), the ""language"" of Jesus in the material, with regard to thought-forms and etheric higher & lower selves. It's quite a treat to receive such a broad insight into the past, and the wealth of information on John the Harbinger as well. I've made it a practice to read the whole New Testament each Christmas; This book will probably take it's place this year. For more answers about the Akashic Records, read material on Edgar Cayce (There is a River) Good reading to you!"
2,For beginners,"There are plenty of writing guides available for writers in every stage of their careers. A Writer's Guide to Powerful Paragraphs is definitely one of those how-to guides better suited for beginning writers.The author models his paragraphs the way I learned all the way back in high school. This is not to say that it's a bad thing, but it is geared more for non-fiction writing of the formal essay variety more than anything else.More than that, this book's formatting is amateurish at best. Every paragraph in the book has a space between it; no doubt put there in order tom make this little how-to book long enough to able to use perfect binding.There's really nothing new here. And for a writer looking to strengthen his/her own writing style one might be better off simply reading works from other well-known writers whose style they admire in order to learn more."
3,A good collection of shows,"It's a shame, but even on those occasions when these shows might have been put on cable TV the Christmas shows seem to have rarely been on during the limited rerun of these programs. Some of them are well-worth the time needed to watch these. The fact that Buster Keaton was in one episode was a bonus to us!"
3,Overpriced,"It was exactly the comb I wanted, But, I found it at several stores at a much lower cost after I bought it."
1,This is not by Jack Bruce,This is not an album by Jack Bruce. It's by someone named Jacen Bruce (no relation)
3,Sometimes you just want to shoot up and die,"When it comes time to check out--just smoke a cigarette and go down easy. Isn't that the way it ought to be? Although this is the second album by Brightblack Morning Light, and a hell of a cool one, I doubt we'll be hearing any further albums from them, since it defies all reason that any of them could have survived the making of this album. I'm quite certain you can hear 'em wheezing and convulsing in the background during the last track. We can only hope the producer politely watched until all band members ceased moving before flicking off the mixing console. Anyway, I've decided right now, ""Everybody Daylight"" will be heard reverberating down the halls of my building when they come for me with a body bag."
1,snoooooze,man this album is boring. i saw them live in LA and it was even worse. the lead singer stormed off stage and threw insults to the audience. avoid this band
4,Got what I expected...,"..after reading the reviews on the product, there were no surprises. As explained by another reviewer, this hose is more flexible than the original that came with the power washer. The only reason this is of significance is that the original hose coiled so severely that it pressed up against the muffler and melted it while I was using the washer. No amount of duct tape is going to suffice on a 2000 psi hose, thus the replacement hose. Upon opening I immediately bent the hose to remove the coils and it laid flat instantly - nice! Curled it back up for storage with no problem."
5,Omigosh!!,"This is an awesome bellydance DVD!! Two beautiful girls tell women like me, how to dance socially and get into shape at the same time! They teach us bellydance steps that aren't so far out that I can't learn or use them while I'm dancing! I won't look foolish, because they've simplified the teaching process, so even a little, old, clumsy person like myself, can learn the steps. If I can do it, anyone can!! I know I won't look as good as they do,but I won't feel like a clutz!! They're obviously intelligent, verbal girls (listen to the interviews)! I also love the fact that they're wearing dance/workout gear instead of bellydance costumes--makes it seem more like aerobic exercise, while having fun! I wish I'd had this way back in '75, when I tried to learn bellydance at the YWCA!!! Bravo, Kaeshi and Amar!! I'll be looking for the next one!"
3,"well, not for me.","I rented this title and quickly realized it's not for me (it wasn't intended to be - I've been performing for many many years). Still I went to the performance part and was dissapointed by the gypsy piece.I've been learning these very moves from different teachers passing them from teacher to teacher, but somehow they don't make any sense if the feeling is not behind them and Kaeshi, a wonderful dancer otherwise, sadly fails to convey the power and the cheekyness that is required for this type of dance. If you don't feel the gesture, it's better to not do it at all!! It just feels silly.But I have seen her dance in other circumstances, live etc, and I love that woman! she is the cat's meow."
2,Nice projector but bad odor,"I recently bought this projector (not through Amazon) and ended up having to return it. It has a persistent burning odor. I thought it would go away after an hour or two, but three days later and many hours, it was just as bad. It was so bad that my wife opened up the windows in our house and it was in the 20s outside.I liked everything else about the projector. It was light and fairly small. The fan was quite and the picture was bright. If it didn't smell so bad, I would have kept it."
3,"A fast paced, funny, and interesting read","This book went by quite fast, but I don't know if that was because it was good or not. It was funny and I found myself laughing out loud. Mainly because of the humourous dialog between the main characters. It had some action but kind of seemed less action-packed than the others of the series. Overall I would recommend this book to others and wish them a good read"
2,Disappointed with this purchase,Two weeks after installation by a professional locksmith our door handle broke off. I have a call into the locksmith to find out if it can be repaired or if it has to be returned to the manufacturer. After spending almost $100 for this handle/lock I didn't expect it to only last 2 weeks.

1,Avoid If You Have Sensitive Skin,"This pillow cover feels like burlap. I was hugely disappointed to discover that the replacement pillow cover is made of the same material. I woke up in the middle of the night scratching my face, legs and arms. I haven't used the product since. I now have to hire a seamstress to make a new pillow cover. Avoid the hassle and this product!!"
5,AMAZING!,This pillow is awesome! It was shipped quickly via FedEx and when I received it it was in perfect condition! The pillow is even thicker than I expected and soo comfortable! I feel like I'm laying on a cloud and it gives me instant relief in my lower back which has been a little sore I am so amazed with this pillow I have been telling everyone I know to buy one even people who aren't pregnant! SOO GREAT!!! I AM IN LOVE WITH THIS PILLOW my fiance might just be out of a job! =)
2,Preg Body pillow,"Hi,I brought this Todays Mom Cozy comfort Pregnancy pillow 1 week back i read the reviews but i feel its not worth the money.1.This pillow takes the whole space,I have a queen size bed and my husband cannot sleep if i place this pillow.2.i am 5.3 height and i feel my head does not fit in the right place and i get lot of neck pain when i use it.3.its a polyster material so its not good during summer4.i have given 2 star because it feels confortable for few minutes then you will start feeling the pinch.I think its good for people who are above 5.3 height.5.For sure its not worth the money i have stoped using it :("
5,BEST PURCHASE EVER!,"I am currently in week 30 and purchased this pillow about 8 weeks ago and it is my best friend!! Luckily we have a king sized bed because it does take up a lot of room, but my husband says I toss and turn less, and I definitely sleep better!!! I don't find the fabric scratchy at all, I like that it stays cool, and at 5'4 it fits me perfectly!"
3,Not as great as I had hoped,I am four months pregnant and am having such a hard time sleeping. I bought this pillow due to all of the great reviews and was very disappointed when I got it. I've been using it for a weeks now and It's getting flat already. I use this with an additional pillow to keep me laying on my side.
3,CAUTION!,"Box is marked ""Pregnancy Pillow"" in big letters. If this is a gift for your spouse, or you haven't told people yet... beware!Oh, and the pillow is really, really, REALLY big."
4,Good even after pregnancy,I bought the pillow once I was no longer able to sleep. The pillow helped a ton! I do wish the portion where your shoulder is would have been shaped a little different but other than that it was and is great.
5,Giant Elf Pants Pillows Are Awesome!!!,"I love this pillow! It's well worth the money and I wish that I had had it during my first pregnancy. It's made my second one so much more comfortable. I was waking up several times a night with hip pain but this seems to have done the trick. I'm about 5'10"" and the pillow is more useful to me with the ""feet of the elf pants"" by my head. This also allows me to use my standard sleeping pillow. I've washed the cover once and the removal and replacement of it are relatively easy considering the size. Now that the size has been mentioned, I must say that this is large! We have a queen size bed and takes up half of the bed. My husband also complains that he can't snuggle up to his wife and has to settle for giant elf pants, LOL. He coined the term but it is pretty accurate. My only other complaint is and its a very minor one, that it is a little noisy when you move around. All in all, I'm very pleased with this purchase and I highly recommend this maternity pillow."
3,Not sure about it,"I bought this product because a lot of people had success with it. I am 5'4 and feel overwhelmed by all the pillow. I have used it 4 times and it now is now off the bed. It felt like I could never get a handle on how to lay in it. I think it would be better suited for a taller person without short legs. It is still good quality, however, and if you are willing to spend the money give it a try."
5,Recommend,I bought this for my daughter. She just loves it! It gives her pregnant belly lots of support. She even brought it to the hospital with her!!
5,LOOOOOVVVEEEE,"I absolutely love this pillow!!! i can't even put in the right words for this. It's seriously a god send. I had a boopy pillow before this, but it was too small and flattened way to quick and I couldn't sleep from all the hip/back pain plus my shoulders hurt from laying on my side, but This pillow is perfect. It's big enough to comfort my entire body, firm enough to give my body the support i need. I've had it for about a month and have yet to see any flattening or sagging anywhere, its also really flexible. I fold it up and use it to prop myself up when i'm sitting in bed watch tv or reading. Seriously, get this pillow. Don't go for anything else."
5,Get this record now: this band is going to be big,"You can say youwere there first. This is a band that brings back a lot of memories. And due to a lot of drug abuse, there was much more forgotten good times. This band is creating a buzz. This is the second joint from the Sling. They have had a lot of experiences touring and playing in front of live audiences. They focus on their strengths this time: noise, power, and freedom. The album begins with a blast of feedback. For twelve tracks it is a hot ride. They bring everything to the plate that is good about music: from The Beatles to The Ramones. Let's forget everything else. This is the coolest band around. The lead singer looks like James Dean."
2,The Majority,"Persons with no military experience are easily taken in by such spook stories; to many, 'the military' is some unfathomly vast entity, and each has their own concept that this is some powerful, complex, and unknowable organization.Likewise for 'the government'. People would have you believe that politicians are proccessed from birth, like suicide bombers, or la Cosa Nostra, with an unbreakable facade presented to 'the public' in order to keep their agenda secret. All these secrets would take tens of thousands of individuals to accomplish and maintain, yet not even one person has ever revealed anything? Even by mistake?As for the UFO nonsense, I hesitate to waste even one sentence on such foolishness, except that it serves as an accurate indication of intelligence level, akin to those who parade their ignorance under the flag of creationism, declaring the world to be as ignorant as themselves."
1,behold a pale horse,i like entertaining conspiracy stories as much as anybody. this book doesn't fit the bill. i totally lost interest in anything bill cooper had to say about 20 pages into the book. there is no compelling anything anywhere in the book. it's all just his guesswork and ramblings about things that are ridiculously improbable. i would give it 0 star if i could.
2,MOST UNIMPRESSIVE,I have read all of Castaneda's books and I am most unimpressed with this book by Sanchez. He has neither the eloquence nor the literary wit of Castaneda. Sanchez has made a career from riding on Castaneda's coattails. He does little to make it easier for the reader to assimilate Castaneda's teachings. Esmeralda Arana (The Path) does a much better job at making Castaneda's teachings accesible to your average reader. I give Sanchez two stars for a thorough reading of Castaneda's material but cannot give a high rating for this boring regurgitation.
2,Great Disappointment,"For one, who read Carlos Castaneda books couple of times and knows the contents pretty well, this book will be a great disappointment. Castaneda is (or at least, was) a cult writer in the Europe; one could not possibly live through the high school or university without running into this magic world - and Dr. Sanchez just repeat over and over again information you already know ""by heart"". I have originals - why do I need the poor copy?Just for the sake of ""impeccability"" - two stars for pointing the Castaneda's books for somebody who did not read them yet."
4,I don't believe the threats...,"So yes, it is insulting to read about prayers/spells/enchantments that use threats against the Goddess. My take on it though is considering when these interviews were done, it was still when pagans had it fresh in their minds to keep our rituals & history secret. What better way then to give the truth and then twist it a little so that anyone that is not of the path wouldn't be able to fully access the knowledge of the Goddess. Or it could've been the personal beliefs of the author reflected in the writing. Either way, I personally noticed if you take the last paragraph out of these prayers/spells/enchantments, it makes it much better and more believable. Whether you choose to believe these threats were used or not, it is a very educational book and I would recommend reading it just to get an idea of our history."
1,The worst ever.......,This was the worst book that I have read. My friend loaned me this book and I am currently putting her on friend probation!!!! I am a 7th grade English Language Arts teacher and I felt like I was reading an essay from my kiddos. How is it that a book can be published with this many typos? This is the WORST!!!!!!
4,Great read,This was a good book. I would have liked to read more raunchiness to the story. The sexual scenes were dull and lack details. I like reading a story that leaves visions. Other than that the story line was great. I liked the ending just wished Monique would have got help for her daughter.
3,COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER,"This book could have been better if the author had a better editor. There were grammaricial mistakes that made the book unreadable. There was a good story line and and it kept you reading the book. At one pont I started to delete it but the it caught my intrest again. In all I like the book but, it took some patience to get thru it."
4,Awakening,"Yes, God truly helps those who help themselves. This book was hard to put down. It is a realistic account of the inner struggle that addiction can take you through in life and the will you must have to survive throught it all. The flesh is weak as Marcus so eloquently discovers in this novel. A bright young man with talent beyond his years who has a weakness that so many have....drugs, however he has been given the spirit to move beyond his weakness and let go of the love he has for his wife who chose not to save herself for her family. A real adaptation of what we see everyday if we only open our eyes. I look forward to the next novel without the misspelled words which could have lost you to complete, however the storyline is what keeps you reading."
3,Quick read but good.,"Choose the book based on the title it was a good, quick read about the choices we make every day."
3,"God helps those, who wants help.","I was expecting a Christian novel but........The book was still a good read, even with all the errors. Many people are dealing with addiction and push a 9-5 daily. It is not my place to judge Marcus of his doing, but knowing that he did try to get help let's you know that he was ready to change, but it seemed his addiction was much stronger. I really could understand all that he went through with his wife, best friend, employers, his Mom. Everyone expected something out of him and he really had high expectation of himself but he had an addiction so.......God helps those....I would really like to get the next book about the Duphree family."
5,What a Difference!,"I own the Nikon D40X, and I'm new to the world of DSLR cameras. I did a lot of reading on this camera and read that people recommended this flash or the SB-800 flash. I thought it was a lot of money to spend on a flash, but I'm amazed at the difference between using the pop-up flash on my camera and using the SB-600 and bouncing the flash. The harsh shadow that is made by the built in pop-up flash on my D40X is completely gone. My indoor shots are much more natural looking and the colors are much more pleasing. I would greatly recommend this flash."
2,Stopped working after 14 months,Hardly used it and it stopped working after 14 months beyond repair.Results were ok when it worked not that great.
5,"A bit of a learning curve, but superb results.","I upgraded to this flash from an SB-400. I had to read the manual a bit, but once I did, I was able to appreciate the advantages of it.I didn't use it as a remote slave yet (only for testing) but the additional range and power allows me to use it in certain situations were the SB-400 wasn't powerful enough. The red assist focus lamps are a lot lets intrusive than the white one on the camera (the flash is already intrusive enough)For 80% of my needs, the SB-400 was enough. But the extra versatility of this one was worth the upgrade for me."
5,worth every penny,I bought this flash to go with my D-40 and I'm very happy I did. Its very versatile and easy to get a handle on with the automatic settings. Its refresh time is phenomenal and indoor pictures come out 100% better then with the built in flash.
4,"Great flash, once you figure it out","The Nikon SB-600 Speedlight flash is a great full featured unit. The capabilities are impressive, and the results up to what you hoped for. The only complaint I have is the instruction manual. I'm a retired engineer, so should be able to understand technical writing, but most instruction manuals are written by idiots. Part of the problem is the normal price you pay for complexity today. It took me 30 minutes to figure out how to use the flash when not mounted on the camera. And to switch back and forth is not that easy either. You need to change both the flash and your camera settings. Overall - worth the price."
4,Good service from Amazon,Does what it says on the box. On tried it enough to tell the excellence of the flash but it's good price and delivery from Amazon which makes it a good buy compared to other places where you might have to take your risk.
1,substitution,Item substituted without permission. Item received not same size. Will not use you again. Still would like the item I ordered.Gregg Athy
5,Worked for me,"I decided to give these a shot, since the name brand 'Vornado' replacement filters were so expensive. They seem to be exactly the same as the ones that came with my humidifier, at half the price. I'll be using these from now on."
1,Not vornado filters,"These are not Vornado filters. They do not fit correctly in my humidifier, and have a nasty chemical smell that I would be afraid to breathe in given my asthma."
2,Way too small,"Dimensions not provided, so took a chance based on reviews. But the opening is smaller (9 inches) even than the one we were trying to replace, so am either sending it back or giving it to charity. Return policy is somewhat punitive--Note to self: Don't order from this vendor again."
4,The curved configuration is a bit of a problem,"The 'backplate' is curved, and only meets the surface of what you're 'attaching it to' in 2 spots...instead of having a flat, rear, contact surface. Maybe this clip is made for some specific device that has that particular 'curved shape'. But I used it for another purpose, and it was difficult (without a lot of superglue), to keep it attached."
4,learning a lesson,"""the accident"" is a book you may never forget. it teaches you not to drink and drive or you may suffer the consequenses. i definately recommend it."
2,I COULD NOT GIVE THIS BOOK AWAY,"I do not care how you feel about Freddie or people who lived his lifestyle. THE BOOK IS TERRIBLE AND THE PICTURES ARE A JOKE. I could not even give this book away to the public library!You can read better and more accurate material for free online. There are many fansites that have reproductions of interviews conducted with Freddie and the other Queen members. A year or so ago, a trade publication dedicated the entire magazine to Queen and I learn new information.Take my advice and search the web for information and photographs, you will be glad you did."
2,An Intimate and UNabriged Memoir,"This book could easily have been condensed to 1/4 of the pages. Each event or memory written about goes on and on, and on... - impatient readers beware.While the author does a great job of providing every little detail, it is amazing to believe that he could remember everything in this much living colour, and doubtful that at the time he carried around a notebook to record everything happening around him.Generally the writing is poor to midland at best and it is obvious the author is not a professional writer. The book also could have been organised a bit better, for it is not chronological, nor are chapter headings or topics given.The reader will sense that the author wrote this book out of memory for his friend, Freddie Mercury, rather than out of primary interest in the royalties. Overall, this book is for only the most fanatical of Queen fans and for those supremely interested in Freddie Mercury."
4,Book is very interesting,"I found the book interesting for the following powerful ideas 1-People who claim to not believe in psychic connections,supernatural phenominon and UFO type ideas regularly attend religious functions whos basic premise is communication with a higher phenominon. 2-The concept of multiple Alien species makes sense.Think about what was facing the Native Americans in 1491? The Spanish,English and French. 3-The concept that the human race cannot be an effective galactic entity without an effective World Government."
4,good pouch,"ended up not buying the lens the lens pouch was bought for, i liked it anyway, used it on another lens. kinda pricey for what it is."
3,Me Vs My Daughter,"My Daughter LOVES Mickey Mouse, however she is young and only seems to enjoy his new Clubhouse style cartoons. The older ones ( like the ones I grew up on) she doesnt care for so much. I actually enjoyed this more than her."
2,"Great idea, poor quality","I've had this dryer for almost a year now, and like the styists who also own it, I find it temperamental. It does a great job while it's working, but the thermostat gets progressively buggier after about three months. If you turn the dryer off, you'll have to wait for it to cool completely before it will turn back on. Now, it turns off while I'm in the middle of doing my hair. The stylists have three or four of these so they can alternate working with one while the other(s) cool off - as I said, when they work, they're terrific. I'm going to replace mine with another brand."
1,ripped off,"still waiting for refund or replacement! item was defective--cap did not fit so barrel broke when i attempted to get cap on. returned the product but have not had any response from vendor. paid them the courtesy of not writing review until giving them sufficient time to remedy situation--over 2 mths later no word. vendor was ""your best hair day""."
5,da freestyle king,"some of yall dont know what yall are talking about. lil' flip goes fad. the only cd that wasnt good was underground legend 2. but other than that all of his cd's go hard. lil' flip will always be the freestyle king. just because he is not at the top doesnt mean he is not one of the best. the others are just tryin to ""steal his style""."
5,A little flavor of the West done up in a delectable way.,"This book is truly a work of art, both in writing and illustrations. This detailed art of Sneed is both gorgeous and imaginative, fitting the text to a T! This is a wonderful story any child would love to read. Every child has dreamed of a horse at one time or another and will surely relate to the story. With Addy's vibrant and comical story telling, both children and adults will be sure to find this book delightful."
1,not very good...,"I espected a quality shoe, But the edges where bad looking over all Not worthed. Sorry!!!"
5,Pillar to understanding society,"Along with Paul Fussel's Class, these books are provocative views of modern society. Like ""Class"", Gabler doesn't really tell you anything that you don't really know but he does lay it out in a manner that I, at least, had never considered deeply. In doing so, he revealed a weakness that I recognize in myself and in much of the people in this society. Weakness? Gabler doesn't judge. He presents the case and steps back but there is some amount of consternation. How else can you view it? When a person's life becomes nothing more than fulfilling a part in the play? Is that good? Or is it the natural outcome of a society that finds itself more and more removed from the constraints of Mother Nature?"
5,Awesome!,"Very compelling read. If you want to be challenged to think, this would be the book. I highly recommend it, and i'm sure i'll be lending it to several of my friends."
4,2 Corinthians; New Testament Commentary,"I like the indepth of the Word of God by Dr. Kistemaker. Which makes understanding of God's word more simple, specially understanding the biblical language."
2,Disappointing performance and durability,"This design might work for fruit with exceptionally thin rinds. Anything else doesn't turn inside out completely, so the rim folds over as you squeeze and traps most of the juice and pulp inside.The hinge pin on mine broke after a couple months, rendering it useless. It's certainly not something I would buy again."
1,Squeeze 1/2 the juice,"I wanted a handheld squeezer like the one I have for limes which works super great! I used this orange squeezer:first time use on normal oranges, it was too big for my hand to squeeze so my husband had to squeeze. Second time I tried with some blood oranges which are smaller in size. After it squeezed I noticed that the orange still had a lot more juice left. I guess is that it needs something on the juice meat side and once closed the skin side of the squeezer did not reach down enough. I am disappointed and will probably not use it."
2,Requires way too much strength,"I owned the lemon-sized unit and the lime-sized as well...ended up giving both to Goodwill. Much too hard to squeeze for me even though I have larger hands I also have a bit of arthritis in my thumb joints.Bought a small electric citrus juicer which works far better for me. I buy large bags of lemons and limes from Costco and juice them up, pour into ice cube trays and freeze for drinks and cooking. Works really well and really fast."
1,Enlightened Parents?,"I thought it was very unwise to leave three girls home alone just for the sake of a weekend camp-out. If these girls are young enough to come jump in bed with you, then it is highly unlikely that they are teenagers. I enjoyed Spirit Song and Phoenix Rising. However, when this book started out with the story of leaving the children home alone, it certainly made me question Mary Summer Rain's judgment!"
5,Best version of Sym #2,"I do not own this entire boxed set, but owned the 2nd symphony and song cycle 2 disc set. Sinopoli's tempos and transitions are slower than many of the established favs, (Bernstein & Solti), but I think they are perfect. The finale has a more glorious and steady flow and not as hurried as other version seems to ""rush"" to get to the end. Sinopoli savors this moment and it is wonderful. Fantastic intonation and a very warm tone overall. Looking forward to hearing his visions of the other symphonies."
5,Gesundheit!,"Gesundheit! Is the story of Hunter ""Patch"" Adams and his struggle for healthcare reform and alternative health solutions. The book is a very easy read and much of the problem is stated so that the layperson can understand the problems with the medical care system, as it exists today. It also goes one step further than most by offering a solution to the problem. Under the idea of ""friendliness"" Patch and his group of Clowns have helped treat over 15,000 patients and have spent the last few years fun(d) raising to build a hospital on the Gesundheit Land in West Virginia. The book doesn't do the land or the project justice [...]"
3,Laughter Medicine,"Patch Adams, MD, is clearly one of a kind. A man with a vision about changing health care. He has many good ideas. But, many are far too Utopian for times and the systems and the people.His book is almost all philosophy. Not much for stories. Which disappointed this reader. The few stories he shared were about trips to Moscow mostly made with groups of clowns, etc.This reader thinks Adams could have gotten his message across far more effectively and enjoyably if he had practiced his own medicine, so to speak, in authoring the book. I wish him better luck next time."
2,whiney,the main character is whiney. the hero is annoying and their attemp at a love story fails. not a good book at all.
5,My favorite book about Chakras,"I bought this book because I wanted to understand more about chakras and how the aura works. It not only explained that it perfect clarity but also describes how they work on the basis of liberating and manifesting creative energy, which I found to be very enlightening. This is the book to have about chakras!"
5,A User's Guide to the Chakra System,"I have been using this book as a learning tool in a class that is designed to help me with aligning my Chakra's. I am impressed with the various tools such as exercises, stretching and information. It is full of flowing information and each Chakra lesson fits nicely in with all of the others. My teacher has used this book for many years and hers is full of marked pages. I hope mine will be as lovingly used as I continue with learning about my Chakras."
5,We want more!,it's been so long since the last release! We need more! We want to buy more seasons of Falcon Crest and Knots Landing! Release them now!
3,German release,"As you may have read here, the first season will be released in Germany in early May. If you purchase a region-free DVD player with an NTSC convertor (such devices start under $100), you can view the discs from Germany. Note that if you order from amazon.de for delivery to the US, they will waive the 19% value-added tax, which will cover a good portion of the shipping."
4,My first purchase from Amazon,"I was very excited to get the 2 DVD set of Tina Turner Live Amesterdam/One last Time. It arrived very quick, it surprised me. Live in Amsterdam was awesome couldn't be greater! One Last Time was a bit disappointing. It appears that the sound is off, it looks like Tina was lip singing. The only way I can describe it is by the video is a lot like one of those old Chinese kung fu movies where you here what they are saying before their mouths move. Over all I am happy with my purchase, mainly because of it being Tina."
3,See's Candy,See's candy is always good! The candy we recieved through Amazon was good but not fresh. Most pieces were starting to change to a chalk color and were dry. We were disappointed in the quality of our shipment.
4,The Cult - Best of Rare Cult,"I think I own every CD The Cult ever made. This is a good album, and I would recommend it."
4,TONS of fun!,More songs would be good but the game is a blast!What I love:-Competition against others-american idol competitionwhat I hate:-no Paula :(-it only comes with one mic :(
5,Require resource for small business,"I've had this book ever since I started my company 20 years ago.One of three books I could not have made it without.Others are Hawken ""Growing Your Business"" and Kamoroff ""Small Time Operator"""
4,Hootie Does No Wrong,"The first time I saw Hootie and the Blowfish was in 1993 when I was a freshman at USC and they played a frat party I went to - I was completely hooked! They continue to be my favorite band! Darius has the most amazing and distinct voice - I can't get enough. The only reason this rating isn't 5 stars is because they didn't record my favorite 2 cover songs they used to do (maybe it's a copyright thing) --> ""Mustang Sally"" and ""Love the One You're With."" But I can't complain too much - this whole album is a treat!"
4,Something the fans deserved!,"Finally, a collection of the stuff that for whatever reason, didn't make the original albums, or wound up scattered (get the title now?) over various soundtracks or import versions of the albums...all in one place. The band has been doing 54-40's ""I Go Blind"" for years. in fact it was recorded back during the Cracked Rear View sessions...appeared on the Friends TV soundtrack...Use Me has been a concert tune for a long time too...nice to see these and all the other songs together that up until this album have been a case of get 'em where you can find 'em. Thanks guys...and thanks for continuing to be consistently excellent...for those of you who STILL (!) aren't familiar with these guys, get their new Best Of collection...and this one...then go out and grab Cracked Rear View...and then the rest of 'em!"
3,Nice item but make sure it fits!!,"This item does what it claims to do, and does it well, but make sure it will fit the side of your tub! It is adjustable but does not open very large and so as a result I risk electrocution every time I use it because I sort of balance it on the tub side! Measure your tub wall before you buy!!!"
2,Disapointed,"Was so excited to finally have a real mixer! And it has been wonderful, I really have loved it for mixing. After the first year the black knob on the front just split apart and fell off! We have now owned our mixer for about 4 years, light use only. Last month the beaters quit running, I would guess the gears are plastic and stripped. Not sure what to do now? Maybe they are all made with plastic parts inside, or maybe the artisan is a better built machine? I'm sold on stand mixers, just not on kitchen aid!"
2,does weezer deserve a tribute?,"Do they really? All these bands sound the same. Nerdcore, riot nrrd, emo or whatever its called now. All the songs sound like the originals except for GOD and the excellent ""pink triangle"" by (now defunct)Awkward. It was done with a Rolling Stone swagger not associated with Weezer. And they even had horns. A great cover of an alright song. Look for this album in the used bin. It would be worth it for the Awkward song. Also try to find the original with out the more popular bands. Mostly local band here in LA/OC area"
4,"good, but should have wires to attach.","unit works good, but needed two small wires to attach to water heater. Should come with in my opinion."
1,Canon Pixma MP800 - Unsatisfactory,"I purchased my Pixma MP800 in June 2006. After a few uses, the printer malfunctioned with a 6800 error and Japanese characters. Canon service offered no suggestions to correct the error. Instead, they shipped me a REFURBISHED, dirty printer, not a new one (totally unacceptable). Since they also sent a new printer head and ink cartridges, I installed them in my original printer. That worked, so I returned the refurbished printer to Canon.I print/scan infrequently (fewer than 5 pages/week). With almost every use, however, the printer had a low ink cartridge, so I continued to use my very old HP Deskjet 730C for most printing jobs and the MP800 for scanning/copying only. All to no avail: the MP800 has again returned to the blinking Error 6800. Nothing works (print, copy or scan), the printing head is locked to one side, etc. Needless to say, I must now purchase another printer and scanner, but it will not be a Canon."
3,One Major Flaw,"Over all Canon produces great products, Cameras, Copiers, Scanners, and Camcorders. This printer is no exception. With the proper hook up (USB 2.2) the speed and ease of use is unmatched. The photo view screen is a bit blurred, but the photo produced is great. Beware though if one ink cartridge is empty, the whole unit shuts down. Oh yes and that flaw I mentioned, for some numb-skulled reason Canon has deceided none of its printers marketed in North America will print directly to a CD/DVD disc. So if this is an option you want or need, Canon says ""TOUGH, OR SO WHAT""."
5,Very pleased !,"After many years with various ink-jet printers they all fail in comparison to the canon mp800 all in one printer. I am especially pleased with the photo printing that it produces and the high quality resolution it gives to my prints. So far it has done everything better than any other printers I have tried. The dual feed is nice since you don't have to change out the plain paper for the photo paper everytime. Also convenient is changing the cartriges, very simple to do and the indicator lights up to let you know it is inserted correctly. I would highly recommend this product."
3,a deadbeat movie with a loose screenplay,"this is a no-big-deal movie. trying to portray the struggles of a bunch of song writers and singers who messed themselves up with drugs, endless chain-smoking. all the songs(if you could call them songs) in this movies were so bad. no wonder these people were losers. we simply couldn't feel anything about this drug addictive female singer/mother. the screenplay was a quite a loose and failing one."
1,Disappointed,"Frank Turner Hollon's short novel left much to be desired. The only redeeming quality that I myself found was that it was a quick, short read that could hold your attention enough to be distracting. Though an interesting subject, I felt that it was lacking and empty. The writing seemed to show a scarcity of creativity and hardly showed depth. It seemed that a 26 year old wrote it--and indeed, a 26 year old did write it.The Pains of April should only be read if no other reading material is available at hand."
2,Another user for whom the enamel has worn off.,"We purchased this juice squeezer about six months ago and had been using it for a few times a week with no complaints, until the enamel started flaking off... Now it's in the trash and a stainless steel model is on the way."
1,Poor construction,I was able to juice six lemons before the handle cracked. I guess making a lemon squeezer that is strong enough to squeeze lemons is too much to ask for.
1,Broke the first time I used it,"On the first use, the metal at the base of one of the handle cracked and broke. I am not a very strong person, in fact, quite the opposite, so I am quite positive that it was incredibly weak metal, and very easy to break. Overall, I would not purchase this item again, nor this brand. Terrible!"
2,Good construction with one design flaw.,"I was sick of the cheap plastic lemon squeezer I had been forced to use in my Navy days as the anti-scurvy officer aboard the USS Belle-haven, Connecticut. I stayed away from lemons in general for many years after my retirement, but was delighted when I ran across the Amco Enameled Aluminum lemon squeezer. What a dream, aluminium construction and a beautiful yellow patina! I've been using it now for several months and am delighted except for one issue. When you squeeze my lemon, the juice runs down my leg.Happy squeezing!"
1,big piece of crap,"just received my lemon squeezer 1 lemon and then handle cracked ....if i try it again handle will break off,total crap!!!!"
5,Excellent for multiple lemons,"Excellent for squeezing multiple Lemons and cleans easily, just as was reported on America's Test Kitchen. But for a single lemon a hardwood reamer is faster."
1,Broke after second use.,"I used this squeezer to juice 6 limes, and I was very pleased with how it performed. I then handwashed it and placed it away in a drawer.Fast forward one week. I cut a lemon in half and started using the squeezer. After just starting to squeeze, the handle snapped apart from the body, leaving me with a broken juicer and flecks of yellow paint on my counter.I'm pretty disappointed given the otherwise good reviews on this item. My only guess is that they've changed up the manufacturing and the new castings just aren't as good as they once were."
1,juice isn't worth the squeeze,"don't do it! this squeezer snapped in half the second time i used it. it is aluminum, but the hinge is thin and unsubstantial. quite likely made in china."
4,This works fine but...,"This was a spur of the moment purchase for me. The squeezer works perfectly fine, but as I can perfectly squeeze a lemon fine by myself, I'm not sure how much utility this provides while it takes up space in my kitchen drawer. It is a nice tool to have if you make a lot of salad dressings or lemonade."
4,"Good quality, effective product","As others have commented, this squeezer does not necessarily get every single drop of juice like an upright juicer might, but I find it much easier to use and certainly less of a hassle to clean. It is well made and sturdy and definitely gets the job done for my teas, lemon water, etc."
3,Bad paint job,"the device works great, but spend the $ and get the stainless one.The paint peels from the acid.Don't bother with the lime ""sized"" one. At least lemon and perhaps even orange."
4,"Easy to Read, Easy to be Motivated","I enjoyed this book, it's an easy read and very thought provoking. The best thing we Canadians can do is to contribute to our RRSP through payroll deductions. It's definitely an eye-opener to the idea of planning ahead for your future and David Bach tells how to do it. I've bought copies for each of my teenage sons."
1,"Save your Money, Folks","This book is a waste of money, folks. What this guy tells you, you are able to figure out for yourself. I buy the guide so that I don't need to go through all of the combinations and permutations for puzzles that need this type of solution. I buy the guide so that I am sure that I have the right item to solve a problem. I look for accurate information and not misleading strategies. This book did not satisfy my needs. It was misleading, inaccurate and incomplete."
4,The Efficient and Effective Hair Straightener,"I thought this product was fantastic. My hair is long and very curly, and to blow dry my hair so that it was perfectly straight would take more than an hour and a half and by the end of the day my hair would be dry, stiff and frizzy. When I tried the conair straightener, I plugged it in and within a few minutes it was hot and ready to go. Although it took a while to get all my hair straightened, my hair would remain staright for 2 days! Because I move around a lot it was great that the hair straightener was easy to pack up and light weight. I now bring it everywhere with me. No more blowdryers for me!"
5,Great Buy,I had almost given up looking for this product - but found it on Amazon's website and for a great price. Love the product - no other straightner works as good as this steam straightner on my hair.
4,good stuff,"I really like this product. I usually blow dry my hair with a round brush until it's almost dry and then I use the straightening iron on it. I also put a small amount of gel in my hair before blow drying. It works best this way. If I sleep with my hair wet and try to use it in the morning, it's a little more work."
1,Before you jump into this....,"You might waant to read the review I posted on vol 2, it was scary nor will I be nurnt a second time."
2,LENNY,"WELL--I THOUGHT THAT THIS BOOK WAS DECENT. IT TOOK ME FOREVER TO GET THRU IT, THOUGH.I TRIED TO FIGURE OUT---WHY??? THE ONLY THING THAT I COULD COME UP WITH IS--THAT I WASUNCOMFORTABLE WITH THE AUTHOR'S WRITING STYLE / PACE --WHATEVER. I DID NOT FIND THESTORY BORING--QUITE INTERESTING, IN FACT. I ALSO READ AN ADVANCED EDITION."
4,Jennings delivers again.,"This was the second book of Mr. Jennings that I read, the first being Raptor. It followed the same format of a sweeping trek across a continent displaying all of the diversities of it's peoples. I give it a 4 out of 5 stars only because the supporting characters weren't brought to life as well as in Raptor. Kubilai and Marco's uncle Mafio were the only memorable characters, but to me they didn't compare to Wyrd, Theodoric, or Strabo from Raptor. Still, it was a great story and impossible to put down."
1,wrong advertising,"This item is too difficult for a six year old even advertised for 5-8 years old. You cannot return the item once opened, so do not order."
1,Same Messed Up Tape Issue,"I guess I should have paid attention to some of the reviews concerning issues with the tape. The DVD comes completely sealed and looks okay, but did not play in either my laptop or in either dvd player. I am not sure if anything is on the actual disc. This will be the first return for Amazon for me, but not sure what I will do after this as far as obtaining a copy for my collection. I was able to see the movie via the Redbox. An interesting film, but soured because of the delay and issues with the product."
3,Lady J,"The movie was not the best but it had some good moments. The music was synchronized with the scenes and some of Thomas Crawley's performances was awesome! The story line really wasn't that strong & some of the acting was amateur. It could've been a lot better, nevertheless T.Crawley did an outstanding job playing a male dancer."
4,Eye Candy for the Ladies...,This is definitely not a major production but the eye candy alone earned this film 4 stars. The plot could have been better but the casting was on point.
3,Not enough shaking!,I was expecting more with this movie-particularly the acting and the strip scenes. The story itself was not bad though.
3,Not what I thought,This movie is misleading because I thought it was going to be about one thing and it was about something completely different.
3,Nice Video,This video is out takes from the Blue Planet series. While it is visually great there is little information to go along with the video clips. Good if you just want something pretty to look at and are not looking for any sort of information.
3,From a Financial Advisor,"While this is a decent book with decent advice, his thoughts on Modern Portfolio Theory are dated and stubbornly backed up with tired quotes.Specifically, he paints a straw-man argument against what he calls ""Active Management,"" which is only an empty shell of what a knowledgeable financial planner would advise.While the basics of Modern Portfolio are sound (asset allocations over individual holdings), I find his touting of Indexing and condemnation of Active Management to be out-of-touch-with-reality."
2,"goofy 70's exploitation film, on a very subpar dvd release","This is one bad release, a goofy 70's exploitaion film starring Seymour Cassel, Sondra Locke, and Colleen Camp.The dvd quality is awful, faded picture and shoddy picture quality, and the worst offender, there ARE pauses in playback whenever a new chapter begins, just plain bad, music is typical 70's stuff.I'm sure glad I didnt pay much for this!The company who released this subpar product is called ""Cinema Pops""."
2,Buy it cheap in a 50 movie pack and get 49 more movies,"I got this movie as part of the 50 movie pack For <$16.00Suspense Classics 50 Movie Pack CollectionThe quaility seems to be about as good as the stand alone release. The title is changed to ""Seducers"".For the money, this is a great deal because it lets you look at older movies you are considering for purchase. You can then spend a few more bucks and get the ones you want in (hopefully) a higher quality edition."
1,"So bad, you'll laugh till you cry!","This is one of my all time favorite movies. It is so horrible, you'll laugh till you can't breathe. I have made all my friends watch it and they had the same reaction. Also, it makes a great party game..every time someone says ""George"" you take a drink. The opening theme song gets stuck in your head ""who's the one who spanks my bottom when I've been bad? My..good..old..daaaaad!"" This is the perfect movie for a laugh and belongs in any ""b"" rate collection."
2,"Typical ""B"" grade horror flick",I purchased this video just to see Colleen Camp and Sondra Locke before they got famous. The movie was a bit over the top and alot of unnecessary mayhem.
5,Very happy with shoes. Great Deal!!!,Very durable and my daughter loves how the feel. Better quality than her more expensive pair. Highly Recommend these shoes.
3,Padraigin,"This will be given later to a newborn to help with her library of traditional books. Let's not the traditional books die out, please."
2,Poor Retelling,"I got this book to use for preschool homeschool and I am disappointed in it. The illustrations are fine, but the stories themselves are terribly dumbed-down. Long tales are reduced to a few paragraphs, offering only the barest bones of story. I replaced it with Michael Hague's Treasured Classics, which offers more detail - and beautiful illustrations - without being too far over my preschoolers' heads. The only disappointment is that this book contains The Selfish Giant (told in so few words as to make it worthless) but the Hague does not. Don't bother with this bland book - you could tell the stories better yourself."
2,Wasn't Impressed!,"I was definitely disappointed in this book! With all of the reviews, I thought it would be great, but the retellings were just not what I had hoped! I thought ""The Little Mermaid"" was the worst of them all! Terrible retelling of that one! I would rather just have gotten the actual stories of these fairy tales! I was not completely happy with this purchase!"
3,"Why So Short, Nellie?","After two double albums from Nellie McKay, I was a bit thrown back her latest album is so short. It clocks in at just under 32 minutes and that includes a song that's less than 30 seconds long. What's the deal, Nellie? Couldn't you have waited a bit longer until you wrote some more songs to put on the album? Or at least made it less expensive. *Sigh* For those wanting ""Obligatory Villagers"" I suggest downloading it here at Amazon (or somewhere else) instead of buying it for $14.99."
3,Obligatory Villagers,This is a pleasant enough CD but not as good as the previous ones ' Pretty Little Head' and the superb debut ' Get Away from Me'. Moor of the same really with an eclectic mix of styles as usual. Don;t like the first track much but unlike most CDs it gets better as it goes on. I find it a bit over orchestrated at times and there is a lack of faster tracks this time. Well worth a listen though.Simon Fyffe
5,Why did it have to end???,"As I always do when a wonderful series of books come to an end, I could hardly believe that it is over. The end is a little mysterious, possibly confusing, but if you followed the series, you just didn't care. Nick Bantock is surely one of the most talented writers of our generation. His books are so comfortable to read."
5,Life-changing.,"I am only on page 14, but I already know that this book is going to change my life. Geneen has an against-the-grain look at dieting, weight loss and cultural expectations of women, and has already made me question the way I treat my appetites and my body. I am looking forward to reading the rest of this book."
4,Great book with lots of good info,I loved the stories that were given and it helped me look at my issues in a different way. Thank you!
3,nothing new.....,"It is a good book.I've read a lot about eating disorders,diets and so on.This book summarizes everything.There is nothing new for me.I was looking for a book with a different idea about food.I find the book ""Brain over the binge"" insightful.It gave me real tools to overcome food issues."
1,One more for the dead camera club,"Took about 250 pictures, then the CCD died. Did a good job while it lasted."
1,Durability Redux,"Took great pictures for a year and then the power switch got flakey on me. For a while it took two presses to turn it on. Then had to press it repeatedly for 10 seconds then 20. Time got longer to turn it on before I finally sent it in for repair. Estimate was $180 to repair a $250 camera. Ummm, naaahh."
1,Mine went bad in less than two years,"Just wanted to add a voice to the chorus of people whose A610 died. I took excellent care of it, and then one day I turned it on and all it could do was take pictures of darkness. Sad that so little quality goes into products these days. Canon should be smarter than this; it makes it very hard for me to trust them with my money again."
1,Canon cameras are terrible!!!!!,"I bought my Canon camera thinking it would be a good quality camera. It worked fine up until I owned it for just under 15 months. The screen went black, and like so many others with the exact same problem, Canon REFUSES to fix it. Saying it is out of warranty. Bottom line is that Canon produced a line of defective cameras, and I for one will NEVER buy another product that bears the Canon name. Now, all I have is a really expensive paperweight!!! I hate to throw it away! Maybe someday, Canon will come to its senses and offer to fix it. But I won't hold my breath. If you are even remotely considering buying a Canon camera, I would strongly recommend not doing so. Their customer service is absolutely among the worst I have ever seen and experienced!"
1,had to return it coz it was too difficult to figure out,"I bought this camera, and unfortunately, I had to return it. It came with SEVERAL booklets, and one would just refer you to another. It was just too difficult to figure out. I'm a novice, and this was my first digital camera. I wanted something simple. I'm sure it's a very good camera for someone with digital camera experience, but this is NOT the camera for a first-time user."
4,Read the book,"We bought this camera to keep my 78 yo dad busy during a family gathering. His first venture to digital technology, he spent LOTS of time reading the book and trying things out. The biggest problem in his learning was that the chip that comes with the camera is so small as to hold less than a dozen pictures. So, when you buy the camera, BUY A BIGGER CHIP AT THE SAME TIME!!!!"
2,Pictures are soft and noisy,"Features and functionality are very nice, but I cannot get a single sharp image; pictures are all blurry and noisy no matter what setting i use. Like the previous reviewer, I also get the camera shake icon way too often. I assume from the generally favorable reviews that the camera is a good one and that I simply have a lemon."
