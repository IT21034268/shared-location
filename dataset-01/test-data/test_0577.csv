2,Flickering - but amazing customer service,"First we have to say that the Bulborama service was amazing - they did everything they could to assist us with our issues. Unfortunately using the bulbs in numerous fixtures, and trying new bulbs sent to us, they continued flickering. The flickering does stop when you turn the unit off, and then on again - but starts again after about an hour. The light is bright and shows true color. The customer svc rep told us it may be our fixtures. We will have to see how other brands of bulbs work in our offices. Again, we were very impressed with Bulborama's service."
5,In Search of Satisfaction,I though the book was very well written. The Dialog was excellent. I truely enoyed the book. Also I read it to a senior citizen group and they could not wait until my next visit. They would be sitting and waiting when I walk through the door. I give it my top rating.
4,"Yes, I AM Satisfied...","This is the 2nd book I've read by Cooper. The 1st was THE WAKE OF THE WIND. Cooper really knows how to tell a story. She wraps so many life lessons into her books. I think that's what I like most about her. I haven't read her short stories because I don't really like short stories. Each character in this book is given their own voice & Cooper fully develops each. Her writing is so good it's as though YOU yourself live in Yoville! I recommend this book for anyone, if you have teenage kids get it for them so they can see how every action has a consequence. Also for bookclubs. My bookclub is reading it now for the month of January."
5,Still the same...,"The L word soundtracks are amazing,such great CDs filled with very good songs!... and this one's huge (2 CDs!)without a single disappointing song,it is a selection of the best female voices of the year 2005 and maybe 2006.The first CD is the sexy one with pop/rock and a little techno and the second the classy one with indi/jazz and a trip-hop tune by Esthero,one of the best band on that category.Anyway if you loved the two first soundtrack you will love and even more this one.Lesbian mixes are definatly the best even for guys!... loll"
2,Where's the Beef?,"I saw this book at the local bookstore and browsed through it. It looked really cool so I bought it. After watching the ESPN video-version of the book, I assumed the book would have been of the same caliber. It isn't. Although there are many excellent photos the composition and the editorial is weak. Where is the Beef! This book lacks statistics and a continuity that would make you believe this book was made for the non-baseball fan. Because of the fluff and ""image"" of this book, the video is a much better value. I should have spent I few more minutes in the bookstore browsing before I wasted my 40 bucks!"
1,Very poor quality,I was so happy when I found this drum. My son loves to watch Pooh Bear and that drum looked like the one Christopher Robin had. But it got broken the same day it came. Very very poor quality. I would not recommend to anybody.
3,Quality of Balsamic Vinegar,"I cannot claim to be a connoisseur of vinegars, but I've tasted a few different Balsamics in my life, and this one doesn't surpass some of the cheaper versions. It's good but not outstanding. I would not buy it again."
2,Weak Songs and Weaker Vocals,"There is honestly only one place I agree with some of the other reviewers: the playing and the production are good and the appeal for Yes fans is very obvious. The tracks are thickly layered and crisp.But that's where my two stars stop. The songs are tedious and the singing is horrendous to the point where it doesn't sound like the vocals fit the rest of the record. I'll say it this way, the vocals are downright unlistenable. To be fair there is a part in The Promise that is excellent, really nice harmonies. In fact it sounds like Yes all over again.My advice is that Yes fans may like it to a certain degree (the other reviews give that indication). However the band should have taken Peter Banks' advice and worked on the vocals more. Perhaps with professional vocals the songs would have come off better.Syn fans best avoid this one."
4,A Great Present for the Roseville Collector,"I bought this book to give to my husband for Christmas. This will be the book he takes with him when we hit the antique and flea markets. There are no pictues, so you have to know what you are looking for, but it gives the buyer a general idea of how these collectibles are priced. The one failing this book has is the same failing almost all price guides have: The prices are usually for high end antique shops. Therefore, the prices in this book are usually higher than the ones we see here in our part of the country."
1,Corporate Greed,"Corporate greed...When is it ever enough for you pigs? Top dollar purchase for an edited,no bonus feature set.Classic show,embarrasing edits by Paramount who may have reached a new low.You people suck."
5,"genuine, refreshing, awe-inspiring, jul3ia.","i won't begin, in the thousand words permitted me on this site to fully express my Love for the message these songs encompass, or for the singer who wrote them. each song is special in its own way and because i am fortunate enough to know jul3ia, i can say that she has not written these songs merely because the melodies were nice and the lyrics were brilliant (although these things are true). these songs are completely honest and 150% from the heart. this is why they induce such a sense of freedom and the urge to stare wide-eyed at the world as though it's the first time you've ever seen it(in fact it may just be!) ""the 3 is silent"" is the soundtrack of the soul...i would personally encourage anyone who listens to this cd to feel free to imagine jul3ia singing these songs just for you...indeed, i do believe that is her intent."
4,Kypton 3Cell Lamp,"The Kypton lamp is one of the best lighting sources for the Mag-Lite, however it does not compare to the Mag-num Star Xenon lamp for the MagLite. The sharpness of the Xenon lamp far exceeds the Kypton lamp in candle power, and the overall brightness and range of the product. Although I gave the Kypton lamp a four (4) star rating, I would give the Xenon lamp a rating of five (5) or better if I could.Thank you"
5,Pat McManus,Pat only continues to make people laugh. Another great short story edition to the many he has already written.
2,"Fun to read, but not at all plausible","The exciting style kept my interest all the way through, so I enjoyed it, but the plot was so implausible that I kept gagging on it. The actions of the characters was almost uniformly stupid. I know it was just to keep the plot going, but really! Just one example, why didn't the bad guys burn the lawyer's office after they took the files! There are many worse ones from beginning to end, but I don't want to spoil the plot for anyone.One of my pet peeves is the absolutely inaccurate science. If someone is exposed to radiation, they do not become radioactive, do not pose a threat to anyone, and do not have to be kept behind lead walls. The plutonium health effects were laughably wrong. No wonder the public is confused on the subject of radiation.I couldn't put it down, but it was painful."
5,Critical Mass Should Be Critically Acclaimed,This book was outstanding. It was wonderfully read and extremely entertaining.Not your usual terrorst wants to take over the world book.With the reduction of nuclear arms in the sovier union and the state of their economy is it possible that someone might sell an old nuclear weapon to a rebel group. This book made you think about this and many other things.I rank this book right up there with the best of the best authors.I highly recommend this book to everyone.
2,This Martini needs to be either stirred or shaken,"I quite like many of Martini's books, though some have disappointed me. But I found this one sadly lacking in plausibility. It seemed to me to be more of a parody of a thriller than anything else. The characters lacked depth and I just plain lost interest in them. I sort of hope that the sequel hinted at in the epilog never happens."
5,Still our favorite rice pasta,"I keep trying other brands recommended by friends or on Amazon, and keep coming back to the tried and true - Ener-G Foods pasta. I've been using these lasagna noodles for over 10 years and everyone loves them. Most of the people I cook for are not on a gluten-free diet, but they eat these as enthusiastically as I do. These noodles work well whether I boil them the day I'm making the lasagna (when I have failed to plan ahead), or put the lasagna together the day before, wrap it tightly, and put it in the refrigerator to let the noodles soften overnight (my preferred method). Great stuff."
5,An Excellent Book for New or Potential Jack Russell Owner,"A very useful and informative book full of good, solid information about the JRT. We recommend this book highly to people interested in potentially purchasing a JRT. We have been so pleased that we give a copy with each puppy leaving our home. A super and inexpensive reference full of wonderful color photos."
3,For your puppy,"A well-constructed book to help you out during your puppy's first months, but in my opinion too centered on it. Once the training stage has been covered there's not much left; nevertheless, useful for first owners of a Jack Russell."
2,Don't be fooled: It's not even VG's virile member.,"Notice the edit when the camera moves down to his nether regions. Such chutzpah: Using an amply endowed body double to stand him for him. I'll bet his conquests are disappointed.Otherwise, pretty amatuerish, low-budget affair, e.g., a long single take of him driving with the camera mount crooked and his face forced out of frame. Good 10-minute shot of the back of his head and the backseat, though. Maybe an amateur can be a director, but not a DP.Still, VG's bizarre personality offers some dark ironical humor (I think it's ironical). Anyway, better than Ron Howard or Spielberg."
1,Wake Up!,"What are you people talking about? Forget all good reviews posted here. THE FILM IS CRAP.Watch it if you want (like myself) to see the Chloe Sevigny doing a fellatio. The film has an excuse (or meaning if you like) for the wanderings of the hero, but why such graphic sex scene? I can only assume Mr Gallo is trying secure audience. Maybe is because I don't have an open mind...Get lost: sexual liberation is from the seventies, man! This is no Caligula, which even the porn scenes can't spoil the film."
1,Most boring film I have seen,"Thank goodness for 4X fast speed - other than the beautiful photography, which is across the country from the car, NOTHING happens except for the highly publicized sex scene (which could have been tastfully edited to a few shots, rather than coming across like a porno). This ""could"" have been a good 10 minute short. I cringed when I just read that it was originally 118 minutes. THANK goodness I rented...."
2,Skip the DVD. Download the porn scene.,Yeah. Yeah. A fine work of art. Degenerate art perhaps. Skip the DVD. The movie sucks terribly. Just go to any number of celebrity porn sites and download the oral sex scene. That's the only part anyone really cares about.My only question about that scene: Did Chloe really swallow or was she just acting?
1,"Self-indulgent, boring film",This is the most boring and slow-moving film I have ever watched. It was an impulse buy and I regretted not reading all the reviews on amazon before buying. The only thing that could redeem this film would be the soundtrack. I would totally sell this DVD away or give it to someone who wants to watch chloe sevigny performing fellatio.
4,Could be what Easy Rider was for the 60's!!!!,"Vincent Gallo has come up with a ""in your face"" docu-drama, kind of an alligorical case history of depression, boredom, and yes, sexual freedom never quite aquired in mainstream cinema. The film seems to work no matter what ones feelings are for it. In a maze of films where people have their heads blown off every 10 seconds, THE BROWN BUNNY comes through cheap,fast and thought prevoking. Vincent you have BALLS!!!!!"
2,Keep the FF button close,"The premise of the movie is decent, and the ending is almost good, however it's a torturous ride to the end. 90% of this movie is the main character driving... Just driving, no dialog, no music, just road noise. I recommend hitting the FF button whenever the car is moving."
5,"Excellent poetry, highly recommended","I have followed Jim's writings for a few years now and they have never failed to give me inspiration, comfort and food for thoughts.At times, you will learn uncomfortable truths, but you will also learn a lot about life and about what it means to live with AIDS. James Hyde has taught me many things - buy this book and see for yourselves!"
4,484 picture capacity,"i like this card as it affords me the luxary of loading a huge number of pictures and not having to worry about running out of memory. i can't notice it being any faster, but then i am not a professional. i have a canon pro1 and it meet my every requirement."
5,An Executive Decision,"Lexar Compact Flash Cards have a good reputation amongst many digital photography professionals. The ""WA"" (write-acceleration) feature provides added value to distance this card from the competition. Excellent return on investment! A MUST buy. ~""O"""
2,Old firmware does not work with Canon DSLR cameras,"Some of 80x Lexar CF cards including this 1G ones do not work with Canon EOS-1Ds Mark II, EOS-1D Mark II, EOS 20D, and EOS Digital Rebel XT. Lexar released a firmware update on June 3rd, without which you may have a problem of images disappearing. Be careful not to buy a CF card with old firmware since YOU have to bear the cost of sending a defective unit for upgrade service.[...]"
2,Early failure,"This card worked fine in my Canon Digital Rebel XT for less than three months before failing. If you get this, be sure to carry spares!"
1,Putamayo strikes out again!,"This is not a good introduction to Kermit Ruffins. I own all his cd's and have seen him play many times.This is another case of a record label having no clue. He hardly even plays any of these songs. Pick up any of his first 3 or 4 cd's to get a better idea of his talent.Putamayo may be well intentioned, but once again they are way off the mark."
5,Thomas fan delight,grandson cannot get enough of Thomas-anything with thomas is a must buy --good price sine most of Thomas is expensice
5,Next Big Thing!,"Blueprint has a great sound. These are talented guys. Darren McClure has an awesome voice, and writes some deep and meaningful lyrics, that everyone can relate to. I predict this band will be a big success someday very soon! A good crossover album, with a bit of alternative, a bit of rock and catchy lyrics you can sing along to. Dont miss out, I think this first album will someday be a rare collector's item!"
2,You have to be a rocket scientist to set this machine up.,"Toshiba SD-V295 Tunerless DVD VCR Combo Player.I have never been so disgusted with the setup of this machine. After a month, sometimes it will tape and sometimes not. All the wires are hooked properly, but yet it seems to have a mind of its own. I do not recommend this product.90 DAY WARRANTY. MINE DIED ON DAY 120. CHANGE THAT TO ZERO STARS."
3,"This was a gift ,",I purchased this DVD/VHS player for my foster daughter for Christmas.She is very happy with it.
5,Queenie's a Gem,"What a surprisingly great book! We chose Queenie, One of the Family on site from the library because of its whimsical illustrations. Now, after reading it to our three year old, again and again, we're constantly surprised by the new things we discover together. Now a family favorite, it's a thoroughly engaging book: the detailed illustrations are a delight for children as well as adults and provide a starting point for endless discussion. The text is easy to follow, thoughtful and melds seamlessly with the pictures. The book as a whole is funny and charming."
2,Disappointing,"I loved ""The Witch and the Warrior"" and was really looking forward to reading ""The Rose and the Warrior"", but ended up feeling disappointed. The cute adjectives that were used in previous books were way over-used in this one, and to tell you the truth, they weren't so cute anymore. Might be nice if Karyn Monk tried a different plot formula for her next book."
3,What dose it do,I bought and used has it says on some web site no go but it smells very nice the seller sent very fast and free product with it very great.
4,The power of diamonds,I used this and some other pads from this vendor to polish some concrete countertops I built. Worked really well - the surfaces are glass smooth. Only drawback I found that that the printed grit number on the back of the pad can be smeared by water. Since you use these with water it can be an issue. I wrote down all the colors of pads with the corresponding grit numbers and saved it - away from the water!Good solid product.
1,For non-readers,"Do you really think cliches are the ""secrets of success?"" This is a book to give to someone whom you know won't actually read it."
2,A Mediocre Maria muddles up this Turandot,"As the other reviewers have noted, this is a dazzling production of a brilliant musical score, but if your lead is not up to snuff, why bother. Much praise has been given to Maria G., the lead, but I found her singing mediocre and her pronunciation non-existent. The other soprano who sang 4 performances at the Metropolitan Opera House at the same time was Lise Lindstrom and she is magnificent as Turandot, vastly superior to Maria G.If you must get this production, you are better off buying the original one with Placido Domingo and Eva Marton. It may not be in HD, it may have a a few glitches here and there with the singing, but it is totally superior to this particular version. Sorry Maria G., learn how to enunciate."
4,A good inexpensive golf cart,I like this cart. It folds more easily than the cart I had before. I am curious that the pencil holder is not big enough to hold a regular golf pencil. I used a round file to open one of the tee holes on the handle to hold a pencil. It doesn't have a wheel lock but I just turn the cart sideways on a hill and results in no problem. This is a good product for the price.
5,Used it a lot,"I've been using this pull cart for about two years now, and it has served me well. I look forward to many more happy days walking the courses."
3,Scares my child,"Having enjoyed them as a child, I searched several toy stores for a jack in the box. However, the jack in the box scares my normally fearless 20 month old daughter. Although the music brings a smile to her face, she frightenly clutches my arm in anticipation of the surprise inside. She often brings the toy to me, but she refuses to turn the knob herself. I don't remember the suggested age for this toy, but MY daughter is too young."
4,Once Well-Loved,"I loved this book when I was a kid,would take it to school,and read it every day.It is the movie in a book!,with pictures from the movie.It was a definite favourite for me,the picture of the muppets as babies was very cute."
4,great family entertainment,"My kids love this movie and my wife and I like it, too. It's not a great movie, both because it has a rather creaky Jules Verne plot, and like most Harryhausen movies it sometimes becomes too enchanted by the ""movie magic"" to pay enough attention to the actors, but these are not things that your kids will mind, and you probably won't be bothered by them, either. What the movie does have is the same thing that is one of the strengths of Verne's books, which is its ""larger than life"" feel. I was always transported by his books into a world of high adventure, and this movie does that for my kids (and it takes me back there, too).The performances in this movie are all solid (and Herbert Lom is very good as Nemo), and the special effects are interesting and entertaining. And it might interest your kids in the book, which is even better."
4,Harryhausen Classic,"One of the best films to feature Ray Harryhausen's ""Dynamation"" stop-motion photography, with a well-handled story with interesting characters bolstering the excellent photography and effects. The giant crab is a standout!"
4,MYSTERIOUS BLU RAY RELEASE,"BOUGHT THE DVD, BLU RAY LIMITED RELEASE WAS REALLY A VERY LIMITED RELEASE. A FOLLOW UP TO 20,000 LEAGUES UNDER THE SEA."
3,Not Harryhausen Greatest but still enjoyable,Not as good as Harryhausen Sinbad movies and not a great Capt. Nemo story but the cast is good so it's ok.
1,Price gouging,True piece of crap! The blu-ray is quite fuzzy compared to the Twilight Time restoration of Picnic. The special effects are bad and the story is so hokey.
4,Captain Nemo returns!,"In the Civil War (I forget the year), union men escape from a Confederate camp via a balloon during a bad thunder storm. They crash-land on an island filled with giant animals, including a colony of bees! Captain Nemo makes his return in this movie. Great action/adventure flick!"
2,Albano-Waite Tarot Deck,"I Only Have One Complaint About This Deck And That Is... It's Too Bright. The Box Says ""In Vibrant Full Color"" But I Think This Deck Goes To The Extreme. I Like It Though Because It's A Waite Deck Which Is Similar To The Rider-Waite Tarot Deck, One of My Main Decks That I Use. I Kinda Have To Laugh At This Deck Because It's Almost As If The Deck Is Telling Me ""You're Blind As A Bat, That's Why I'm So Bright!"" I Would Recommend This Deck, However, Only To Those That Like Loud Colors."
5,Perfect,"There isn't one flaw on the entire CD. And believe me, I was looking good and hard. Couldn't find a one. I just have to admit that everything about RJ Helton is 100% pure perfection. Having also written 8 of the 12 songs on the album is a definate bonus. RJ's got quite the life laid out in front of him.... there's no doubting he's going to go so far for many, MANY years. And I'll be right here supporting him the entire way."
4,"Not the best, but better than Donald Duck Barrino's CD",The album could use some pizzaz but the voice is good and so are the songs and the interpretation. Way better than The Duck's initial effort at releasing an all-squeaks CD.
1,Save your money on this one!!!,"Vocals are weak, music is thin, lyrics are dull. There are good reasons why he didn't win on American Idol, folks!"
5,Well well well!,"During American Idol-Season 1, he didn't really impress me, but listening to his CD changed that! I have a new found respect for the guy, spreading his love of God through his music. God will bless him."
4,One of the Stronger American Idol Albums.,"RJ Helton proves that if there was going to be a guy go up against Kelly Clarkson in the American Idol Finale it should have been him, and not Justin. While I never was a huge fan of either, RJ's album is much better and enjoyable than Justin's boring self titled debut. While the album is nothing groundbreaking, combining pop, adult contemporary, and r&b, it's still one of the stronger albums to come out from an American Idol singer. While the album relies to much on ballads, the majority are very good, such as the beautifully sung Forgive, and the stunning Missing Me, backed by a gospel choir. Uptempo tracks are catcy and fun such as Freedom and My Devotion. Hopefully RJ will have the same type of career that Kelly and Clay are having, and not like Justins. His debut album proves hes got alot of potential, and has the makings of having a long and respected career."
1,Not even worth the price at your local Wal Mart,Ok I have listen to most of the this album and its a joke. I mean come on American Idol is over. Just go on with it. Id rather buy William Hungs CD. Doesnt the album cover say it all. He looks like someone you see at your local county fair in Iowa for free and nobody wants to see. MUSIC MAN get a life your propably just some queen friend RJ. Perhaps he might do well at performing at some junior highschool dance in Des Monise Iowa! If this album is so good why isnt it on the billboard! Hell its not even on MTV!
1,DRAGGIN ITS TALES,"The title is certainly appropos, that's for sure! In the tradition of such films as TALES THAT WITNESS MADNESS, TALES FROM THE DARKSIDE, etc. THE THEATRE BIZARRE is a collection of six stories that are truly strange.Unfortunately, I wasn't impressed by any of the tales. THE MOTHER OF TOADS is sloppily filmed and incoherent. I LOVE YOU has a twist ending, but is slow and monotonous in getting there. WET DREAMS is almost effective but gets muddled by the end. THE ACCIDENT is a misfit---it's not a horror tale and makes little sense. VISION STAINS is just dull and SWEETS is just repulsive.All in all, a waste of celluloid and time."
3,It Lives Up to the Title,"This is a rather strange collection of short stories, told in a theater. Very unusual, but a bit too opaque for me. Recommended for those who want to see something out of the ordinary. If you like the films of David Lynch, Luis Bunuel, or Alejandro Jodorowski, you may like this."
2,RF moduator failure,"I bought two of these for the game selector and the RF modulation. The RF modulator didn't work on either one of them. The instructions said it has a TV/Game button, there is no such button. The game selector on the other hand works fine. So if your TV has RCA inputs it works fine but, if your TV has standard RF connection you will need a seperate RF modulator hooked in series with it for it to work."
2,Never could get the hang of it.....,"I ended up pawning this. I couldn't get the hang of it even with ""typing tutor"" programs. It works well on Linux."
5,A Christmas Treasure,I absolutely loved this book from beginning to end. A great read at Christmas time or any time.
5,Amazing story of the power of the GOSPEL,"Absolutely loved this book. It was a little hard to read in the beginning, but towards the end it is powerful and I was so so blessed by it. God is good."
4,Peace Child,"A true story of hope and courage in the face extreme adversity. Amazing story, not soon to be forgotten. An intelligent story about one family's adventure into a culture far removed from civilization."
5,Enlightening Book,Peace Child is a very enlightening book about the lives of missionaries. I highly recommend it.
1,caution,Unless you know what you're doing... don't buy from these people. Tne disk would not work on my Panasonic It could'nt be formated. ... I was told to call Microsoft. I decide to take the loss being as it would be a too much trouble to send back. They charge a re stocking fee and then theres the postage. I will never buy from these people again.
4,Good Family Fun,Played this game with some friends and really enjoyed it. Had to buy it for ourselves. Looking forward to some family fun.
4,Great information terrible binding,An extremely thorough guide however the binding leaves much to be desired as countless pages of my son's book have fallen out. I started taping them back in but it became pointless and now just stick them between the pages that are still attached to the binding!! I came back to this item to see if there was a hardback edition but didn't find one :-(
2,Books are fine. Order messed up.,"Books arrived in as described condition. However, 2 Charlie and the Chocolate Factories came and no Great Glass Elevator. No response from vendor when I wrote them. I'm more than a little disappointed with this outfit."
5,Beautifully written....,"Ms Potter, as always, serves up a beautifully told story of loss and love. Unlike many other readers, I am NOT a fan of Gabaldon. (I'll always think fondly of Jamie, but prefer scenes of brutality to remain asexual.) Ms Potter painstakingly shows the reality of war and loyalty issues, complete with base villains, with no distasteful scenes of sexual torment. The research is impeccable, the characters three-dimensional, and the tenderness heartwarming. In Ms Potter's books, a reader is allowed--encouraged--to root for the heroes and be assured of justice in the end. Bless you, Ms Potter, for giving us yet another splendid book!"
5,Works very well,"Didn't have a clock in the car, so removed the ash tray and set this in the space. This is the exact right size and right price, pretty accurate and works in the coldest winter days and hottest summer days."
3,eBay Timesaving Techniques for Dummies,"The author stresses that a degree of understanding Ebay is assumed. So, if you are an Ebay newby, buy another book. Also, its primarily for those who are starting an Ebay business--if you are just selling your old trains or something similiar, buy another book. If you are starting a Ebay business, it has some pretty good suggestions."
4,I dont know what I did without it,This volume goes into much more depth than I expected. It is a wonderful resource for those with an interest in the uniforms of the Afrika campaigns.
3,No where near as good as season 1,"Dirt season 2 has nothing on season 1, acting is great (to be expected) but the dialogue is shonky, the storyline is repeated a bit from the first season but they don't pull it off as cool as they did it in season 1. Not overly impressed, but Courtney Cox helps to brighten it up somewhat."
4,a good deal,"""The Deal"" is a good movie-- is there something negative about Christian Slater that I'm missing? He's good, and so is the supporting cast. It is good that it takes a while to figure out what's going on-- that's suspense, right? Other movies of his have also somehow missed a wider audience-- ""True Romance"", for example.I can't stand movies with low production values-- so this movie has good ones. The soundtrack is also great-- another prereq for a good movie. I can't find the soundtrack foir sale-- any help would be greatly appreciated."
1,Major disappointment,"I found this book on a list of ""Cthulhu Mythos"" related items and thought it would be good. Big mistake. The first couple of chapters were good, with the proper atmosphere and creepiness. Then came the next hundred or so pages, which suddenly turned the story into a mishmash of sex, sadism, and filthy language, and even a bizarre message of ""oneness with the universe"". A few vague references to Cthulhu does not make a ""Mythos"" story."
2,Not the best.,As usual the reviews here are misleading. This book was an ok read but nothing great. It was too long on mundane discription and too short on plot. And the liberties that the author takes with common sense is shameful. I won't give away what little plot there is except to say that it was unbelievable especially the ending. I wanted to throw the book against the wall on that susposedly dramatic scene. It was so soap opera melodrama. If you like to read books just to see how bad they can get than do buy this one. It started out with so much potential but took the dreaded easy slide into clich`e ville.p.s. just for the record the secondary characters of Jack and Charlotte are the best thing here. Too bad they don't have a book of their own.
4,The truth about the new workforce,"I am a fan of Bruce Tulgan's and have been since I read Managing Generation X. This book brought the lives and jobs of many people to my attention through the use of testimonials. For every major point in the book, from How to find a job you are interested in to achieving life/work balance, there were credible testimonies which supported and made Bruce's points come to life. This book not only captures the mindset of the new worker, but more importantly, their heart. Great Book!"
3,Great if you're a fan.,"This is a pretty cool DVD, but doesn't contain enough videos or live footage. If you're a fan, go ahead and buy it, but otherwise, just check out all ten of these videos at redhotchilipeppers.com, as repeated viewings won't be necessary for you, anyway. The live performances are pretty cool too, even though ""Stone Cold Bush"" is taken from more than one performance. The best video on here is ""Fight Like A Brave."" It's pretty cool and stylish. ""Taste The Pain"" and ""True Men Don't Kill Coyotes"" are also pretty cool, but the rest are pretty boring or cheesy."
2,Not as good as the cd,"If you must buy a Red Hot Chili peppers DVD, I recommend their ""off the Map"" This is a collection of video, its not live (that's not a complaint though). I own the ""what hits"" cd and I think there is a lot of good songs on their that are not on this dvd. Probably they didn't make the videos for all the songs, which is understandable. The songs are not their better work, and you will find yourself snoring to this, or annoyed. I don't even know the name of the first song at the moment, its either under the sun, or return to the sea, or something like that, if you know the song Im referring to, then this is basically what a lot of the songs on here sound like, not a lot of the peppers aggression here. Best video is higher ground"
2,Dry - Historical Scholarship,"Detailed but dry history -- I don't see what contribution to enhanced understanding of the events this book brings, or for what purpose the work was undertaken. Mainly of interest to the specialist or student of millitary campaigns I guess. For me it was disappointing and dull."
2,Can't do it,"During the first 5 season's, we had minor changes to the cast (a different actress playing Gladys Kravitz, a different actress playing Larry Tate's wife). These changes were not as good as the original actresses, but we made due. However, the changing of the main character husband, I just can't pretend not to notice. One of the things that made the show so good was the chemistry between Montgomery (as wife) and York (as husband). While the focus was Samantha's witchcraft, York was every bit important to the show as Montgomery (if not more). York's absense left a void that could not be filled by anyone else."
3,"Worth the Read, but Not At The Top of the List","Good sound thought in this book, especially her call for Christian action rather than Christian thought, words and piety...Not exactly a thought provoking, invigorating book, but worth the read nonetheless.Good, but not her best---and she is really, really good!!"
3,Aweful!,I just don't like rats. They are vile and digusting creatures. I don't like planet Jupiter either. It is a dumb name.
5,The Dark Portal.,"In the time when the earth was green and blessed by the lord of the mice- the green mouse, a young mouse called audrey is shocked at the dissapearence of her father. On what supposed to be the most important day for a mouse, turned into a quest to find her father- and the truth. In her way stands the thing all mice fear most- the Grail and the lord of rats, a half god, half demon that is held within it. The Dark Portal is definitley a book I would reccomend all people to read. This book is not only superbly written, but it also has a great story line. This story portrays a mouse who shows true bravery, and burning desire for loved ones, in the face of uncertainty and danger lurking benind every corner. This story has adventure, fantasy and a lot of emotions in it, blending together to make a masterpiece and I think is destined to be a definite classic."
4,Reissue of HOB title 'When the Gates Swing Open',"When I first saw the title, I was looking forward to 'new re-releases' on cd format. When I received the cd I found it was identical to the HOB release of ""When The Gates Swing Open'. The music, the vocal, the emotion of Clara Ward cannot be discounted. This is a marvelous release of the voice of Clara Ward, but it has been previously released. If you do not have the HOB album, it will be a great addition to your collection of Clara Ward. Her voice is in good form and the messages inspirational. This is one of the recordings issued before she went out into the highways(nightclubs)with her singers. Enjoy."
3,Hard to get into!,"This was book 2 in the series. I really had a hard time getting into this one. The characters seemed stilted, with little emotion or interest. The story seemed drawn out through the whole book. What could have been told in one chapter was dragged through the whole book. I just didn't enjoy this one at all. I usually love Amanda Ashley's writing but this one was almost boring to me."
1,Not worth your time,Sequel based on the premise that what happened was REAL. OOH! Scary!! NOT!!! The film work was amateur but the idea would be that they had to do some of that as it was supposed to be amatuer. I'm not a big fan of that.
5,DONT STOP NOW !!!,"For all of us who truly love the finest productions,this is one that must be swallowed.A beautiful collection of 24 separately filmed VIDS spanning much of Bryan's fabulous career.Heck, I'm gunna' go watch it now.........HELLO to the MAN!!!"
2,A one-eye opener into suffering of dogs in Iditarod,"Although the book is an eye opener about the Iditarod, Jonrowe should have told us more about the suffering the dogs endure. She does tell us that mushers sleep on their sled while the dogs race. And, during the race DeeDee says numerous accidents happen-- mushers hit trees and bounce off rocks. But she doesn't give enough details. The reader is never told that dogs die in the race, that they develop ulcers, lung damage, anemia, rupture discs, paralyis,pneumonia and viral diseases."
5,An absolutely must read!!!!,"For anyone who has started the whold ""Dakota"" series will think this is the best one yet. She wraps up the whole story lineand the characters are ones that you will love forever. I could not put this book down. I am orginally from North Dakota and probably loved it all the more for that reason. Debbie did a great job in talking about the midwest way of life. I loved it from front to back cover."
3,"Promising start, but overall disappointing","I enjoy books that portray magic in a modern setting, so I was intrigued by the promise of this book. The author does a good job of stage-setting, weaving strange happenings and an increasing sense of magic and mystery into the otherwise mundane setting of the English countryside. Unfortunately, just as the magic begins to manifest, the main character is sent off to ancient Atlantis, on yet another variant of the ""teenager is the chosen one who must save the world."" The book never really recovers from the change of setting, and any sense of reality or character development is lost. The are other authors who do a much better job of sustaining both the sense of magic and the development of interesting, believable characters."
3,Musical sound is weak,"I was expecting a lot more beautiful crystal chime sounds than what this product delivered. Glass tinkles that were barely okay. I returned it. I gave it three stars because someone who likes glass might like the look, but the pretty musical sound is what I wanted. Rob Nokes at [...]"
5,Malarky,"Of all the family games we've played over the years, this is the best. It relies on creativity, not knowledge (although knowledge helps).Many times the answers can be hilarious - and you can laugh until it hurts.Also teaches the fine art of quick thinking and interaction.Enjoy."
5,Great game for family with kids.,"It's really a fun, educational and highly interactive game. This will allow your family to have a great time together, we really look forward to playing this. My kids friends (ages 10 - 14) ask to play when they come over. The questions are just great.Everyone gets a chance to be creative. This really is a fun family game. We first read about it in Good housekeeping Magazine where it was voted, by parents and kids, as the best game of 1999.That's my two cents. We really do like this."
4,"Fun, but Beyond Balderdash is better","This game was fairly fun. But, we had problems with scoring. We had to adjust the rules to make more sense. The game centers around bluffing others into believeing you have the right definition of words. It's always fun to get a chance to ""lie"" when nothing is at stake. My husband was the one who said Balderdash is better. I think they're about even."
3,The game was not as good as we expected.,"The game asks you to bluff to questions you might ask of life.So far so good.I guess we ran into a pack of dud questions as it was'nt very funny.The true answers were generally lame but hey you be the judge.Question; On nutrition labels, why does the total number of grams of fat often far exceed the sum of saturated and polyunsaturated fats? WHO CARES? The real answer is just as dry.Is this a game or a test."
2,Bad Choice,"I read the reviews and thought this would be a good game for my family. I have played Balderdash and thought that this game might be similar or better. I was sorely dissapointed and wish I could return it. The game is poorly made, not intuitive and the questions (or words) used on the Malarky cards are terrible. The cover slips are very difficult to use and simply frustrated my kids. This is not a game for kids. Very very dissapointed. I seriously think most of these reviews are made-up or were added by people working for this company."
3,Great debut novel!,"[ASIN:B002BWQ676 Identity Crisis]]Debbi Mack's first novel is worth far more than the 99 cents I paid to download it. It's not a great novel, but it kept me turning pages, and there was tension on every one of them. I kept wanting to learn what would happen next. I am looking forward to Novel No. 2Identity Crisis. The characters are well defined and distinct, and although the arch-villain seems a bit stereotypical, he is satisfyingly evil. And the first-person protagonist is fully developed and sympathetic, a solo-practice lawyer willing to bend the rules on occasion to look out for her client's interests -- and the client herself."
5,Blast from the Past,I was thrilled to find this peice of entertainment history available. I used to watch these movies years ago on Sunday afternoon television and jumped at the chance to purchase them on DVD.
3,problems but resolved,I bought two of these for my pontoon boat. They work well. The cords are long enough for easy use. One of them failed within a couple of weeks. I returned it to Minnikota and it was quicly replaced with a new unit.
1,"In the author's own words: this is not a ""how to"" document.","It's nice to get your colleagues to write glowing reviews, but this book only provides hope and no help to the sufferer of chronic bowel problems. It contains excessive extraneous information (the author is allergic to chickens and uses a Macintosh computer), as if you wanted to know. Dr. Gershon admits ""I have cured no one in my lifetime,"" and that he can still hear his beloved father asking him the question: ""What disease is that going to cure?"" Gershon says he always had trouble answering that question, and he will leave readers with more questions than answers as well. It's hard to believe this is a serious book since it provides no index, even though published by a major book house. One wonders why someone would write a book only to disappoint readers?"
1,There is no material to review,If you're looking to read and assimilate information about options and then test yourself on the information just acquired - this is the exact wrong book!This book contains only questions and multiple choice answers. The answers are in the back. The learning method is to take the tests blindly and then see how many you guessed correctly. It is learning in reverse.I was hoping for an explanation of a term or concept and then a follow up test. There are only tests. As such it may live up to the letter of its title but it fails miserably as a teaching tool. For what it purports to be and for what it delivers it seems ridiculously overpriced.A very unsatisfied customer.
2,The worst ever,"I bought this cd thinking the music from the movie was going to be on it. NOT EVEN CLOSE. Don't bother getting this cd, its not even worthed. I wasted major money and Amazon should've had the songs on preview, but they didn't help either. A Shame."
3,If you are looking for the mozart piano concerto no 23 version...,"according to IMDB web site, here's the info...Piano Concerto No. 23""Written by Wolfgang Amadeus MozartPerformed by Jenö Jandó and the Concentus HungaricusCourtesy of NaxosBy Arrangement with Source/Q"
3,A first glimpse at some of our cultural differences.,"May this book trigger your interest and curiosity further on the human species. How fortunate we are to be different ! At a time in history when the word 'globalisation' has become an evidence, let us all realize how much we have to loose by unifying or not our cultures. Do we really have to have the same burger chain everywhere ? Maybe not. Does is make sense for us to speak a common language ? Yes of course, as long as the other languages remain. One currency unit ? One clothing style ? One operating system ? Miles or kilometers ? Can these open a dialogue ?Let's not forget where we come from and how we became the way we are. Learning about our differences is probably the best way to make the most of them. This book pushes us in the right direction.Enjoy !"
3,possibly worth owning for the artwork...,"This book + CD release from frequent Nobukazu Takemura collaborator Aki Tsuyuko is more of an art object curio than an actual album. Which is fine... except that the music on the CD, which at first sounds appealingly naive, playful, and eccentric, soon becomes tedious yet ignorable, with unrelentingly dull electronic organ sounds prevalent throughout.The accompanying book, however, is rather lovely to behold, with fanciful child-like art mingled with some visually intriguing musical scores. In fact, it's almost worth buying Hokane for the wonderful cover image alone..."
1,What clock? I can't even see it...,"First of all I received this clock and the ""auto set"" feature didn't work out of the box...nice. Then the LED's are so dim that you can hardly see it at night. If you have it on your nightstand and you're a couple feet away, it may be ok. If you plan on using it let's say, in your living room, well maybe you'd better look at something else. I'm going to return it. Enough said."
1,I found a way to set the time!,1) Stay up until midnight2) At EXACTLY 12am press the reset button (under the 9V battery --just throw away the black cover!)3) Repeat every month (or when you get tired of looking @ the wrong time)HERE IS A REPRINT OF THE MANUAL (it does NOT work)[...]
1,do not buy!!!!!,This clock keeps loosing time minute by minute. there is no way to set it...... throwing it out. Horrible! I am looking for a replacement now on Amazon.
1,Not the model number i ordered,"We had model 40010, the alarm was very nice to wake up to. the clock became inoperable, lost time,etc. I found a new model 40010 Insta Set on amazon and ordered it. Plugged it in with a 9volt the time did not agree with the time, the pm did not light up and the alarm sound is alarming, unlike the first one. I have to set the clock at dst instead of pst to get the right hour.I will return this one, but which do I order to get the same as we had before and why did the first one fail?I can't locate the company to find out which model will replace the original Inst Set 40010 I ordered."
4,Very nice,"It's a very nice book and the story is well written and fun to read. I like it a lot and the message of peace and not wanting to do every silly thing just because the others are doing it appeals to me. The drawings are nice but unfortunately only black-and-white, so my son doesn't find this book very interesting. I hope he'll like it more when he's a bit older. He much prefersPuer Zingiberi Panis: et Fabulae Alterae (Latin Edition)which is full of colorful pictures.See my 'Latin Reading List' and 'Best Latin Books for Kids and Teens'."
2,A promotional tool only,"Sorry to all the people who liked this video, but the entire thing struck me as a big promotional tool for the Complete Symphonic Recording. The majority of the songs on this video are lifted directly from it, even in studio scenes.The only two highlights really are the Norwegian version of One Day More (which unfortunately they talk all over) and Linzi hately's version of On My Own."
5,Blondie Rules - Record Companies Suck!,"Great DVD quality of previous Best of Blondie VHS, plus 3 additions. Missing is Nothing Is Real But The Girl Video from No Exit, as well as about 7 others. Packaging [stinks], as does everything EMI Records does anymore. Blondie deserved so much better in both its Greatest Hits CD and DVD. However, don't take it out on the group. They are GRRRRREEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAATTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTt.Bob A"
2,Please go away!,Alan Jackson what can I say! Boring boring boring! Only song worth anything on this CD is Where Were You When The World Stopped Turning and the duet with the ultimate George Strait.It rates two stars for those songs alone!
4,Probably the first decent album this year!,This Drive album is something everyone can enjoy. Finally people are finding Country music and it is about time people did. Of course the bait to buy this album is for Where were you when the world stopped turning probably Alan Jackson's greatest song yet. There is so much more great stuff like Drive and the duet with the one and only George Strait. This cd stands out in country music right now because this album is so much more country style then to what else is out. Although most country albums right now are also very good Drive has that special kick to it that other albums do not have right now. Anyone who likes music can hear this you don't have to be Mr Country to like it. This better win a award at the 2002 CMA's like album of the year because this is crafty work.
5,His best ever!,"I bought the album because it contained ""Where were you..."" Every single one of the tracks is a potential top ten. I particularly like the title track and ""Work in Progress"". You can't go wrong buying this one!"
1,All broken now,"I bought a dozen of these glasses less than a year ago. The last one broke today. You have to treat these glasses like fine stemware. If they bang together in the sink, they crack and break. If they fall over in a sink full of dishwater, they break. I had started washing each one individually, but the last one finally broke.Perhaps, if you have a dishwasher they might hold up better, just don't over crowd them.I compared this manufacture's glasses to some that I've owned for years. The rim at the top of this glass was noticeably thinner than on my old ones. Perhaps I just got a bad batch, or they are really skimping on the amount of glass they are using to make these.The smaller, 14oz tumblers from this manufacturing have much thicker rims and I have not broken a single one.I can not recommend this product."
4,"Great quality, no breakage, wish they stacked.","Great quality, no breakage, wish they stacked. These look fantastic and my wife loves them. I just wish you could stack them at all to save space in cabinet but they will not stack at all (not even 2). Otherwise, fantastic, high quality and have held up quite well already to the demands of a five kid family!"
4,Simple and fun,Kids (4 and 2)don't even know they are learning as they rush around the room to find the corresponding colour or shaped object in the room. Have even purchased more for gifts. Ideal age 3.
2,can doo roo,My wife bought this for our kids and this item is a little cheap but does keep your kids occupied for a few minutes.
2,useless index,"Although once you go page by page looking for a topic you can find it, the index is one of the lamest I have seen. They should have spent more time on developing it. Unless I can remember seeing a topic someplace in this book, I will choose my others to reference first."
4,MIS,"""Mejico Maxico"" by MIS is a super-cool, super-hip DJ/producer cd from Mexico City.I found the music very spacey and forward-thinking. It's tons of fun. It's a little goofy at times, but never cheesey.The music is upbeat and happy. There are some Mexican influences throughout. You don't need to speak Spanish to enjoy this CD.Overall, a really cool CD. Very promising debut disc - all-around good stuff!"
5,the best book in the series so far,this is probably the best book in the series. mrs perry did a wonderful job describing the events in the book .I've only read a couple of mrs perrys books but i know that this was her best one .Her descriptions were so good it actually felt like it was real life. If your a resident evil fan you have got to read this book.
4,"""Nemesis"" A Friendly Read","Once again, Racoon City is awash with zombies, mutants, bioengineered badies and surgically enhanced nasties. 'Nemesis', though the fifth book in the series, is never short for new and unexpected horrors as a courtesy of S. D. Perry's skilled imagination and writing style. It seems with Umbrella at the helm and Ms. Perry there to guide their unscrupulous activities in new and horrific directions there is a never ending way for mutagenic virus to wreak havoc. As expected, blood does flow and, as usual, the body count rises rapidily in a repetative but otherwise well paced and evenly told tale."
5,Great,Perfect doll(as well as the other Generation Girl dolls)to inspire girls to do whatever they feel (such as acting like barbie).
4,A Barbies a Barbie,"Being an older collector I think the older Barbies were fine. I'm a little dissapointed that Amazon.com does not carry the black ""Nichelle"" barbie doll, that would be my fav, but over all this Barbie is a great toy for children and a great piece for collectors like myself. This Barbie even comes with her own video camera, magazine, ect. A great birthday or rewarding gift for any Barbie loving child!"
3,oh well not to worry,"Not my Favourite generation girl, it looks like the second edition Barbie has turned out alot better, there's something weird with her face. The body is new as well and unfortunately does not fit into it's outfits properly - the red striped body suit, and other swim wear. The box setup did look excellent however, similarly with the other dolls in the set, maybe I shouldn't have taken her out."
5,A Nice Little Surprise...,"""Shadows and Dust"" got me into this band, and that, in my opinion, is their best release and one of the best metal albums out there. I was really disappointed by ""Serenity in Fire."" It was mostly filler and just plain boring. However, Kataklysm has found their sound again and have put out this killer album. It's not as good as ""Shadows and Dust,"" but is pretty close. If were disappointed their previous album, get this and you'll see Kataklysm can still produce some amazing material."
2,"coasters, coasters, coasters","Using these on an iMac equipped with 4x Superdrive so far has burned coasters half the time (3 out of 6), either using the built-in disc burner features of MacOS X or using Toast Titanium 5.2. The coasters actually look discolored or cloudy, like something happened to the plastic of the DVD in the burning process.Also, the discs are not labelled with their speed -- they burn only at 1x so even when they do burn successfully it is incredibly slow.I would give 1 star but the cases are very nice."
1,Piece of junk,"Top portion of pot is not well attached to base; after a few months use they separated, had to glue them back together. The advertised ""glass"" bubble on top is made of plastic, broke off soon after the base separated. Probably costs them a couple of bucks each to manufacture these pots in China, then they sell for $50."
3,Decent but not what I expected.,"When I first pulled the knife out I thought it was awesome but as I looked at it more the more I didn't like it. The blade is loose, it is not wood handle it is plastic, and it is very bad metal that will not sharpen(I had a Vietnam vet try to sharpen mine and he couldn't do it). I have read some of the other reviews and I don't know what knife they are buying but I got a different one."
1,Good gag gift,It's a cheap knife. but if you didn't know that from the price than you don't care anyway :P lol. I bought it as part of a gag gift survival kit. It did it's job. more of a stage prop than a knife...
1,Frigg'n sucks.,"TERRIBLE. I ordered the knife and it came quickly, but I went to try it out, and the damn blade flew off the handle!!! Literally. Not figuratively. And it wasn't even the same design. Now all I have is brass-ish knuckles because I threw the handle-less blade away. So if you want a cheap-ass knife that has a flying blade, then by all means, get this product. This product is made of disappointment and shame. Look elsewhere."
3,Someone messed up,"Don't get me wrong, i like the knife and all but i ordered THIS ONE (wooden (plastic) handle and gold outside but instead i got one with the handle in silver and instead of the imatation wood i got a red and black one with a scorpion in the middle .... i didnt feel like dealing with returning it and waiting all that time to deal with just a handle, its not like i hate it or i would have but it would have been nice to have the RIGHT one"
1,you get what you pay for.,I made the mistake of listening to the reviews of other people and i know better.this knife is a joke for little kids not only is it NOT functional I would be embarrassed to show anyone this knife admitting that i paid real money for it.That was my brain fart for the year.
3,Loyal Crowded House fans...,"This DVD is for loyal Crowded House fans. Everyone else, stay away. The video quality on some of the tracks is like watching a 2nd generation VHS tape. If you enjoy their music and are curious to see their interesting, albeit non-elaborate video interpretations, then sit back and enjoy. Make sure you buy it on sale!"
1,NO GOOD,I bought this item for my 1.5 year old hoping it would last until maybe 4 years of age BUT the wheels are already giving out only after about a three weeks use (time frame). I would NOT recommend this product to anyone. Spend the money on a different and better product.
1,Uncomfortable!,"The sales manager gave me a $10 discount because it was a display model, so I thought I would give it a try. The head rest was as hard as a block of wood with absolutely no contour. My son could not rest his head back at all, and certainly would not be able to take a nap in this stroller. Also, it doesn't have a 5 point harness, so my one year old was able to twist around too much in it. The trays and storage space are nice, but overall this stroller is just not well designed."
1,HORRIBLE STROLLER!!,"I read the reviews before I posted this one and I may have just gotten a bad stroller but this stroller is terrible. First off, I can't get it to work, the left front wheel sticks and the stroller doesn't go (Imagine that the brakes are on but you can't get them to undo) Of course, that occured the first time I took it to the mall so you can imagine how that trip went! I had an umbrella stroller that I bought for $20 that worked perfectly, it just didn't have a basket underneath so it was really a pain when there was shopping to do - I should have kept it! I have written baby trend so I am hoping they will send me a replacement but we shall see...in the meantime buyer beware! Just as a heads up, the lot number of my stroller is 051 made on 8-25-05 - I would perhaps avoid that lot."
3,"Good basic stroller, but not for tall moms","I registered for this stroller because at the time it got a ton of good reviews online. People said that it was nice and lightweight and was very reasonably priced. I found this all to be true once I got it, but unfortunately it was too short for me. When I had on even a slight heel the handlebars hit me about 7"" below my hips, so I looked like a hunchback pushing this thing around. But, as long as you're not really tall, this is a good buy if you want a no-frills, light stroller. I didn't have any issues with it falling apart, although I only used it about once a week.A bit of advice I learned the hard way: IF YOU ARE TALL, try out strollers in person before buying them!"
1,Serious Regret!,"I like to save money anywhere I can but I wish that I had not bought these even though the pair was under $10. I feel ripped off and like someone else stated the specs. are a joke. These drivers are only useful at low volumes and even there they are not clear. Higher volumes make them sound like all frequencies are blending together into one obnoxious noise. My amplifier is fine for the power requirements and I am guessing that their 150 Watt rating is peak for the pair, so that would mean that RMS is around 75 Watts each. These are bad sounding speakers which I will be returning. By the way I installed them into a 95 Toyota T-100 Reg cab and I am a professional installer."
3,Doesn't work well with Windows Vista 64-Bit,"I bought this axis 1650 server and a Canon MF4150 for setting up my home office. Here are some problems I met:1. The CD that came with the server is not for Vista (64bit) - You'll need to download all these software again from Axis website yourself.2. The manual doesn't explain how you can install a printer after you set up the server. (Basically you need to set up a ""local printer"" with a special port called ""AXIS CAPT Port"" and then specify the location to your printer's driver.)3. I have problem connecting to my MF4150's scanner using AXIS ScanClient on my Vista 64-bit PC. It says there's an error and never connect successfully. It works fine on my laptop running XP though."
1,DO NOT ORDER THIS VERSION ITS CENSORED!!!!!!,"Look at the order screen, this version is rated ""teen"" fallout is supposed to be rated ""adult"" THIS VERSION IS EDITED, ORDER THE OTHER, THIS EDITED VERSION IS MISSING QUESTS ETC WHICH MEANS ITS NOT THE FULL VERSIONS OF THE GAMES! BUY THE VERSION THAT IS RATED ADULT NOT TEEN."
1,"Watch out, there are two versions!","First off, there seems to be 2 versions of this tri-pack. This Fallout Collection version may be the Euro/UK version and has a poor record of working on N. American systems. For me, it causes frequent reboots that makes it unplayable.The other is the Fallout Trilogy pack (also available on Amazon), which seems to be the superior version based off of the US releases. But I have not gotten the other version yet to confirm how well it works.Aside from that, from what I was able to play, even if you use patches to improve the graphics, the game has aged horribly. Just skip all these and stick with Fallout 3 and you'll be happier."
2,Came with a present,I bought fallout collection for 20$ its a great game for pc but it came with a present a virus this was probably becuase i bought it used but it litterally killed all the games on my computer except halo i would reccomend this game to people just make sure not to buy it used
1,Not planning on reading the rest of the series,"A shallow and transparent allegory espousing a narrow Christian worldview where good triumphs over evil by violence, rather than by the power of love. Add to that as story which lacks depth of plot, and has almost no meaningful character development. The result is a story which I found offensive to the extent that I regret reading it to my kids.So ... if you looking for a fantasy novel that bolsters your belief in a titanic and violent struggle between good and evil, then you may love this book. If like me, you call yourself a Christian but believe that God calls Christians to overcome evil with acts of kindness, you will find the book deeply obnoxious. If you are of a faith other than Christianity, there is a good chance you will find it to be a shallow and preachy treatise on a particular Christian worldview which thinks it knows all the answers and does not have patience other faiths."
3,ok product,Ever since my son was a year old he has been a dinosaur kind. i bought this bag when he was 20 months but ended up not using it much because of the size.
3,Ok experience,"I received the book relatively quickly, but it wasn't in as good condition as advertised."
3,"Good read on market strategy, goes after Crossing the Chasm","I loved the author's Crossing the Chasm book and picked this one. The author has done a good job again breaking the market scenario into small pieces/stages and explains the strategy on how to implement them during each. Also I liked the analogy of Gorilla, Chimpanzee and monkey and their characteristics to companies reflecting on how it work & coordinate which makes it easy to comprehend.I liked few comparisons the author makes between selling in Tornado, selling in the High Street, and others, which he has probably gained insights after working in that industry for years.A good read, and in my opinion it should be followed by Crossing the Chasm."
3,"Full Tracklist - Artist, Name, Time",Tracklisting:1) Rotterdam Termination Source: Poing (Easy Synth DJ Paul Remix) (5:54)2) Dance 2 Trance: Hello San Fransisco (7:18)3) Nu-Tro-Gen: Rollin' Reptiles (5:11)4) Immaginazione 2: La Musica Del Futuro (5:00)5) TFX: Deep Inside Of Me (4:51)6) Ramirez: El Ritmo Barbaro (5:51)7) Frequency: Systematic Input (4:51)8) Glam: My Mother Said (Wild Techno Remix) (4:28)9) DHS: House Of God (X-Energy Remix) (6:27)10) Out Of The Ordinary: Der Weisse Hai (6:50)11) E-Trax: Yo Te Quiero (4:53)12) Ghetto Brothers: Pumpin' Bass Manoeuvres (6:34)13) Joe Inferno: Tribal Church (3:54)14) B-Sides: Magic Orchestra (C.J. Bolland Remix) (4:58)
2,Dull,"There is very little wrong with this performance. The singing, playing and conducting are accurate and skillful - and I am confident that Herreweghe has thoroughly researched the material to give us as accurate a reproduction of Mozart's original score as is possible with this only partially completed work. Yes, everything sounds very correct - but unfortunately also very dull. It's like trying to experience a great building through architectural drawings - the drawings may be 100% accurate, but they give little sense of the emotional impact of the original. Herreweghe seems to have no emotional connection with the work beyond his obsessive academic correctness. Has he actually read the text of the requiem - do they mean anything to him? This is so very, very disappointing."
3,tough to follow examples,Tough to read. HW problems are difficult without good examples to follow. Definitely not for self-teaching.
5,This CD rocks!,"this CD is so awsome. I love the Song so much. the only reason i didn't give it an ten is because i think it could be better. The CD shows that Will Smith really can rap after all these years. If you liked ""Men in Black"" you'll like this too. Some of the songs on the full CD aren;t that good, so i'd recomend getting the single. I really like this song, but it could be better. 9 11/12 rating"
4,Fibroid Education,"This book was very helpful in understanding what fibroids are and my options. When I went to my GYN I was very educated and they were not able to scare me into some procedure.All women should learn about their bodies, healthy or unhealthy.Remember doctors are running a business, you are running your life!"
2,Weak and Outdated,Basic stuff. This book collects dust on my lab shelf. Transimpedance amplifiers - you can find this stuff on the web for free. Absolutely no talk of charge integration.
3,3 stars for looks...but functionality you can get for a whole lot less!,"I was tempted to shell out the almost $40 for this little gadget...but after buying a new intel iMac duo, I was a little short on cash. This gadget looks cool and gives you easier access to the back and side of the computer, but you can get the same functionality for a whole lot less.Go to your nearest kitchen supply store or the kitchen supplies section of your grocery store. They should have a plastic ""turntable"" that sells between $7-$12. I was able to get a white one, lifted the base of my iMac onto it...and it works! Now when I need access to the side for the disc drive or the back for one of the USB or firewire hookups, I just have to lightly pull the side of my monitor and the little plastic turntable goes to work.... It may not look as sophisticated, but I just saved myself over $30!"
5,Excellent Replacement Safety Sensors,"The safety sensors arrived today. It took me about 17 minutes. Installation was easy. The only way installation would be easier is if I had someone else to install the sensors. When I plugged the garage door opener back into the outlet, the green sensor lights came on really bright. Note: If your safety sensor lights are getting dim or not lit on your old safety sensors, just replace them. Now my garage door goes down all by itself without me holding the main opener button down. Try them. They are excellent."
5,product is great and much cheaper than Sears,"I am glad I searched for this item on Amazon, I would of payed alot more going to Sears. Thank you"
3,Photography and Content,"4/21/11 the photography and its content were a little different than expected based on the book's title..the analogies for 'black' has been better depicted in other books to be read to children, especially to be read to children of the black race."
5,Billboard raves...,"""Irishman Mark Geary, offers an outstanding sophomore release in ""Ghosts."" His obscurity should end here: With sparse but superlative meditations like ""Beautiful,"" ""You're the Only Girl,"" the pretty lullaby ""Mid-nite Sun"" and the nearly nine-minute ""Hold Tight,"" Geary's songwriting and delivery recall such top contemporary practitioners as Ron Sexsmith. ""Ghosts"" also evokes Van Morrison, particularly his early-1970s era. Perhaps most satisfying about the album is that such a project can be released in 2005 at all-apart from occasional drum programming, these are fully organic, natural-sounding recordings; vocoder, synthesizers and other sound manipulators need not apply. ""Ghosts"" is a collection of superb songs delivered with a quiet intensity that will endear itself to listeners."" Billboard Magazine"
4,Compact but a bit grainy,"This has been a good travel/weekend camera. The pictures are a bit grainy compared to my 6 MP camera, but it's good for the price. It does have a neat ""digital camera for dummies"" setting that's very user friendly and great for those who are new to the digital camera world."
1,Misleading title...,"While the author covers components, principles of operation and general theory, there is very little information concerning the art of tuning a four stroke engine. For someone new to engines in general it may not be a bad investment. If you're fairly knowledgeable already and are seeking to expand your own abilities, you're not likely to find much worthwhile advice here."
3,Opposites Attract,I was a bit disappointed in this book. While the story lines were cute they seem to end quiet suddenly for me. I would of liked to have seen maybe less writers and longer stories or maybe 20 pages more per story. I mostly bought the book for Lynn Kurland so I could add it to the list of her other books I have. It after all contains the story of 1 of the families she so often writes about.
4,Healing Yoga for Aches and Pains,The tape help with my hip and back pain. I was able to get back to walking and continue my normal activities.
3,Candlelight Yoga is better...,"The time for each pose is too short, you'll be busy with changing your body position rather than focus on breathing. I found Candlelight Yoga does a pretty good job on teaching breath, the movement is simple to learn and you'll feel very relaxed after you are done with it."
3,basic yoga,"Well explained and demonstrated poses by both instructors. I wish it were a little longer (doesn't get to one hour). In spite of my physical limitations, I find this video a little too basic. I prefer to have more variety of poses. The woman's voice is more soothing than the man's."
2,An okay read,"I love the fact that Ludie wanted to tell the truth about her sister, Tommie, but I found that Ludie only really knew Tammi as a child and only provided tidbits about her adult life. She appears to have known about as much of Tammi's adult life as I knew. I really didnt find any new information as her singing career blossomed. Everyone today knows that abuse does not cause brain tumors. When I read about her illness and her mom's illness it touched me deeply. I appreciate Ludies's efforts but I did find her being evasive on some issues. My true frustration comes from the double talk. I found myself skipping pages because I was reading the same thing over and over and over again."
1,Trash,"Save your money. There is absolutely no plot, no character development, no drama, no crisis, no resolution. By the end of the first chapter I knew this book wasn't to my liking, but being stubborn, I decided to give it a chance and now I wish I hadn't bothered.The only reason this book even got one star is because there was no other choice. Believe me when I say this book deserves ZERO stars for being utter trash.This is my first time reading Amanda Ashley and also my first time giving zero stars for a review. I love romance novels, and I've read some pretty dumb ones, but this is the worst ever. By the end of the story I was wishing Tracy and Dominic into oblivion."
1,Keep moving don't even bother,If I could put less than one star I would have. This was a true waste of time and money. I should have taken the advice and not picked this book up. Believe me you will regret getting this book.
3,Good Enough for Me!,"This was the first paranormal romance I have ever read, so I don't have anything to compare it to. I love vampres though, and Dominic turned out to be everything I had imagined a vampire to be. He was seductive, lonely, and powerful. However, since it was set in present day, I would have been creeped out by him if I was Tracy. He was too foward, too soon, and spoke strangely. And there is no way that end would have happened in reality. Throughout the entire book she acted one way, and at the very end she switched completely! And that whole thing between her and Bryan was too weird for me. Half of the book was difficult to get through, but the rest I couldn't put down. After all was said and done, I loved the ending."
2,Please enter a title for your review,"One of the most creatively ambitious bands in the scene, but the music confirms what the band name and album title suggest, that their perspective is very self-conscious and their primary ambition is just to stand out. I'll give them some credit for fully abandoning the screaming and metal riffs, but the kind of meandering minor-key arrangements they've found their way to strike me more as the product of looking over their shoulder at what other bands are doing than following their own creative muse. The layering seems haphazard, creating a cluttered effect where all the instrumental parts mutually relieve each other of responsibility for providing a foundation for the song. They're putting the decorations up but they forgot to buy the tree is what it feels like."
3,"Lakers fans will like it, Bulls fans will be disappointed","This is a good book to read, but I wouldn't consider it a complete autobiography of Phil Jackson. This book primarily covers the 1999-2000 season where Phil coached the Lakers to their first title since '88. There is very little about his tenure with the Bulls which is why I say that Bulls fans will be disappointed when they read it. And then it switches over from Charley Rosen writing to Phil writing and back and forth. On the positive for Lakers fans, Phil goes into great detail on how he brought a dysfunctional Laker team together and took them to the promised land."
1,Worst of benny meng,"I currently have Benny meng trapping hands and sil lim tao video which I love, and I thought this would be the same. What I wanted to see was more information on bridging the gap, and the applications as well as drills [like the sil lim tao video was] instead this is simply a video designed to teach you the form nothing more. The applications were mostly left out and no new drills were presented.The ONLY thing this video would be good for is if you are trying to learn this particular style of chum kiu. and since I already practice a different style of forms this video was useless."
4,Great Alternative to Costly Monitored Alarm Systems,"My neighborhood has started having some issues lately and I had considered installing a monitored alarm system. I checked out the cost and I really didn't want to pay it. I found these here at Amazon after doing an internet search for door alarms and couldn't believe it would do what the packaging said (for only 12-14 dollars a piece!). After they arrived (batteries came with them!), I stuck one on the back door and one on the front. They work great. I have had them for over 3 months now and feel very secure. I have not had to replace the batteries yet either. I don't know what these other reviewers are complaining about. Could be operator error in the placement of the sensor? I would give the product 5 stars but it was a bit confusing at first where I was supposed to put the smaller sensor. I just now purchased 2 more for my daughter's new apartment."
3,Late,"""Campfire Tales"" is a story about four teenagers who, on their way from a concert, get involved in a car crash. While waiting for someone to stop and help they decide to keep themselves enteratained by telling each other urban legend stories. It's a wonderful premise however, I guess I'm a bit late to this movie. It was extremely easy to figure out what was really the case here. I guess the true moral of this story is that not everything is as it seems. Still....it's a guilty pleasure."
1,THE ONLY SCARY PART OF THIS MOVIE WAS THAT IT WAS MADE.,"How STUPID a movie can you make? Well, Campfire Tales has taken the worst parts of every other movie in the teen shlock genre and combined into one terrifyling aweful turn-it-off-or-trash-it garbage circus of lameness. If you consider yourself to have any taste at all, you will not be caught dead with this movie. And finally, I must say that I am ashamed of the good folks at New Line for sinking so low. THANKYOU."
4,This was actually pretty suspencful,"I rented this movie about 3 months ago and expected this horrid direct to video release.I was very wrong!The movie is about 4 teens who get in a car accident on their way home from a concert. The teens decide to go in the woods and wait for help and to pass time they tell each other creepy urban legends.Story one is about a newly wed couple who spend the night out in the woods and find out there is somone or something lurking out there.Story two is a classic urban legend with a modern day twist to it.It's about a stalker and a dog.That's all I will tell you.Story three was the only one that was really truely dumb and it's too confusing to get in to.All in all if you are waiting for a good little movie that will make you jump try this movie out. P.S.I lett one story out,but I don't wanna tell you that one because it's very creepy."
3,"Cheaply constructed, but they just eat them anyway.","I bought this for a rat. He liked it well enough, but preferred the tunnel versions. Mostly, I got tired of buying him these things and having them last less than a week. Rats nibble, and this is a cheap product... I knew what to expect. I started cutting the legs off old pants and putting those in there for him. This ferret hammock was good enough to provide me with the hardware I used to attach 70-odd different pant legs to a rat cage, over a period of 2.5 years. I think I still have those little clips somewhere..."
3,Not my Favorite hammock.,"I don't use this one very much, mainly because all four of my rats love to use one hammock together, but they can't fit well on this one. It curves in too much which decreases the surface area. It hangs very low as well. No matter how I hang it I can never get it the way I want it. At any given time I'll only find one of them in it. When I use some other hammocks I'll find them all together sleeping. It's not a bad product it just doesn't meet my rats needs very well. Perhaps for 1-2 rats it would work better, but I have 4."
4,I am starting to see a pattern here,"I have to agree with a previous reviewer. I love Marcia Lynn Mcclure books, she quickly became one of my favorite authors. After having read most of her books, I have to say they are all basically the same. I am fine with everyone being beautiful, but why do the lead characters all have the same feelings? I will keep reading her books, but they arent' as fun as what they used to be. Some of the main female characters cry too much for my liking aswell...I prefer them to be stronger."
3,"Ya, ya, ya, ya.....annoying!","For the most part I enjoyed the story, but not once in the entire book did the author use ""you"". It was always ""ya"". In one 5 short sentences dialogue by Myra ""ya"" was used 5 times! Attempting to show ""dialect"" is tricky at best, but to pick out one word and use it exclusively is like fingernails on a blackboard. Also I didn't realize this was what I'd call a ""bodice ripper"" which isn't my favorite genre, so I probably won't chose to read anything else by this author."
3,Anime,This was not my favorite series. The main character is more whiney than most and it detracts from the storyline.
4,The story continue's,This dvd went a little fast but if kept you watching from beginning to end.I think it rounds off the series very well.
1,VERY Difficult to Read,The information in this book is very difficult to read. It is a photo copy of the original book. A VERY POOR photo copy. The Alphabetical Table of Lucky Numbers can not be read. The copy is so bad the print appears as small blobs of ink. This is a pure waste of your money. It does not rate one star. DO NOT PURCHASE THIS BOOK!!
2,How poor writing style can overwhelm a potentially fascinating subject,The title to this review says it all! Porch's editors turned what could have been a great book into a dull exercise in the use of superfluous adjectives. I couldn't wait to put the book down!
5,Great resource for longtime Christians as well as newbies,"I attend Community Church of Joy, and was excited and anxious to read the book written by two of the leaders of my church. The book is thoughtfully written, and easy to understand and follow for new believers, but not too simplistic as to leave veteran Christians bored. The concept behind each Life Shape makes it so easy to learn how to apply biblical principles to your everyday life. I am a very visual person, so having the shapes to refer to made it easy to get what the scriptures are saying."
4,Good product for the price...,"Very good product, some quirks but good value if bought on sale. Only worth it if the price is under $500..."
4,An all female ballad compilation from avex! This time about heart break!,"""Girl's BALLAD Best ~tear drops~"" features ballads about heart break.Featured on this album are artists on the Avex Trax label such as Do As Infinity (Hiiragi), dream (My Will), Max (Ishou ni...), hiro (love you), SEED (My Love), Uno Misako (Now is the Time), Ozeki Miho (Lemon), Kayo Aiko (Ienai kotoba), sifow (My Dear), Shimatani Hitomi (Itsu no hi ni ka...), AAA ( Deai Chikara) and Suzuki Ami (Negaigoto).In songs such as ""My Will"", the lyrics are about wanting to convey one's feelings to someone you love but can't.In ""Itsu no Hi ni Ka"" (Someday), the song is about wishing for one's love to be received by the other person... someday.For ""Negaigoto"", the song is about loving someone but afraid to commit.Not all songs are about the low side of a relationship such as sifow's ""My Dear"" (about doing anything for someone you love).All in all, a good balance of J-POP ballads from a variety of artists from Avex."
3,Oxy Silicon Oven Mitts,"They work very well to protect you from the heat. My husband has large hands and these mitts are too large for him. We feel a certain insecurity when using these gloves while picking up large and heavy pots / roasters, because there is so much extra 'mitt' that we have to be very careful that we are securely holding the vessel to transport it."
1,bad grips,They look good but they just don't work for human hands. It is next to impossible to grip something with these. I returned them.
1,replacement keyboard,"The price was excellent, the delivery time was very good. There were no instructions included and the first one didn't work. We took the computer to a repair shop and he said the cable was damaged by being folded in packing. The company did replace it but it was very frustrating. We ended paying as much for the cable and repair shop as we would have to have ordered it from HP."
5,A Great 80's Sci-Fi Classic,"I used to own the hidden and hidden II on VHS. Because it is a great movie, I just bought it on DVD recently.I still find the hidden a great and fascinating sci fi movie after all these years. Just about everything about the movie is great, especially the plot. The sound effects were also great, especially at the part where the detectives track down the stripper in the mannequin warehouse.The Hidden has action, mystery, drama, and suspense which makes it a unique film.The Hidden II is an okay movie, but not as good as the first one. The sound and special effects were pretty good but the graphic violence was a bit too much.Even though the plot wasn't that good, I watched the movie a few times to finally understand what was going on. When I first watched it years ago, the only thing I didn't understand was what happened to detective beck. Then I realize what happened to him when the good alien explains to Juliet that the same thing is starting to happen to him."
2,"Children relate well with the story, but this is another book full of poor grammar.","It is so disheartening to see how poor grammar in children's books has been ignored, perhaps has even become acceptable...?The book contained 56 paragraphs. Six of the paragraphs started with ""But,"" and one started with ""And."" Three other sentences started with ""But"" as well.There were several sentence fragments:Everyone shut off their flashlights. Except Gilbert."
2,painful to fingers when you open the cabinet,"These knobs looked good in the package. When installed, they bent as they were screwed in place.When you turn the knob to open the cupboard, the edges are curved in and it can be painful to hands of all ages.It is not a pleasant experience to open the cupboard...they look good from a distance."
2,Another disappointment!,"Another MCSD study guide disappointment! This book lacks depth on almost all topics. Key facts are omitted. As usual with study guides, this book has it's share of typos and errors. Errata is badly needed. Book states that this is all you need to pass the VB Desktop Exam, however I doubt that is possible. Not worth the price, look elsewhere!"
1,"Incorrect information, errored code,horrible learning tool.","This book although covers most of the material on the exam, it misleads you with its errors. Horrible code examples, half of them do not work, as well as incorrect Q&A at the end of every chapter."
1,cd look used,cd look used and it was skipping. It was supossed to be new...I have no idea how new CD could be already scrached??? But I guess that's what I get for the price.
1,Worst phone i've ever bought,"I hate this phone more than anything in my life. I bought it back in February and have had it replaced 4 times since then. Do not buy.CONSpoor receptionpoor picture qualityfreezes up like a computerdoesn't ring very loudpoor sound quality altogetherBULKYPOOR SCREEN QUALITYno antenayou can't see the screen in the suncan't read the outside screen when the light is outvery slow response to keystakes pictures in purse when closed (only 2 of mine did that)POOR BATTERY LIFE, won't last a whole work dayannoying warning about hearing damage if the ringer is on high (except for the fact that i can't even hear it when it's on high)annoying clicking when you open or close phonethe home charger won't stay in the phone, only my car charger stays connectedsometimes the buttons won't workPROSyou can change the ugly cheap plastic cover"
3,Not bad.,"I'm a pretty tech-allergic person. I've had this phone for about a year, and have been very happy with the reception I've gotten in and around urban and rural areas. Cons are that the camera lens and external display are not very well sealed, so dirt is sneaking in to fog them up. Unattractive, but not life-threatening. In addition, the external display seems to have gotten confused these days and doesn't consistently display the time and other icons, but rather a blank blue screen. The other day, the audio stopped working, meaning that people can call me, but I can't hear them, even though they can hear me. Despite all that, I am trying to replace it with the same model because I like the basic features and don't need fancy bells and whistles."
4,In the throws,"I've owned the book for a month now and have been very satisfied with the system presented. I'm a guitar player of over 40 years and from time to time have chosen to decline offers for income producing gigs strictly because of my sight reading skills. The next time I'll be ready, partly because of how well this book addresses the step to step process. I recommend it to anyone who seriously wants to have a firm grasp on the written language of music."
1,A WEAK BOOK,"THIS BOOK IS SO BORING. THE EXAMPLES ARE PAINFULLY BAD. BESIDES BEING A GENERIC BOOK ON READING, THE AUTHOR DOESN'T CREATE ANY INTERESTING WAYS TO READ MUSIC.I AM CURRENTLY ENJOYING THE WILLIAM LEAVIT METHOD MUCH MORE."
3,Not for the beginner,"This book deals with learning how to read music on many levels. It starts with basic concepts and ends with advanced sightreading.It is not written for casual reading, you will need to spend time with guitar in hand. Bring along a metronome as well.This book assumes that you have been playing the guitar for a while (2 years) and that you have never given serious thought to learning to read music.The music presented is mostly classical and not familiar to most players.It would really benefit from an accompanying CD which it does not have.Good luck."
1,Disappointed,"Ordered this item thinking I was getting theMSR Packtowl Personal, which is perfect for taking on bike rides. Not this item! Unlike the Personal, the Ultralite is flimsy and stiff out of the package, and does not feel like a cloth I'd want for wiping sweat from my face. In addition, the one I received was jagged on one side, as if cut hurriedly with scissors. I should have stuck with the robust and soft Personal towel."
4,"Great towel, dries quick","This towel is awesome. I took it backpacking for 6 months and it worked like a charm. It dried quick and took up little space. Even after backpacking I still keep it around for the gym. I can use it as a workout towel or for the shower after. I don't mind leaving it in my gym bag because it just doesn't take up any space.I would have given it a 5, but I did notice that when backpacking that it tended to pickup the smells of my dirty clothes rather easily. It aired out fairly well, but it probably has something to do with the material its made of. A lot of my friends and family ended up buying one after seeing mine."
5,Good- buy the biggest one.,"I love this towel for not only as a small cloth, but as a camping towel. It is smaller than you think it is when you buy it. Please, do yourself a favor, and if you want a pack towel, get this one."
5,The start of a highly under appreciated legacy!,"This CD is simply amazing. It's truely a breath of fresh air in a dank swamp of mediocre music. The songs are exceptionally crafted and are equally catchy as they are heavy. Each track on here is a winner. There's just not enough I can say about this album.As it's been stated in other reviews for other TL albums, TL is for fans of Clutch, Machine Head, Soulfly, Static-X and the like.Stand-out Tracks include:Cosmical Satanical, Blood Sucking Super B*tch, Want's You, Soul"
2,Boring....,"This book is very colorful so it does keep my son's interest. On the other hand, I think the story although simple, is not clear enough for my 1yr. old to follow. Maybe an older child practicing their ABC's could appreciate this book. It is a good way to show your child the letters of the alphabet but I think there are more interactive ways to teach a child the alphabet."
2,Know what you are getting.,I was shipped a purple cane when I had ordered a red one.The plastic pouch is not sturdy and will not withstandeveryday use.
1,4.7 GB? Not quite,"I bought the 10-pack at another store and not a single one of them registered 4.7 GB. Each one could only store 4.4 GB. This is not good when you're DVD project is tailored for a 4.7 GB disk! I would understand if one or two did not have the full capacity, but not the whole box. Try something else."
1,"terrible, don't buy one!",I now own a $1600.00 paperweight! I have had problems with it since the beginning. I have only owned it for 17 months and it needs a new bulb! Yes the same $694.00 bulb everyone else is talking about. And did I mention the over-heating problem it had since it was 3 months old. Run as far as you can from this TV.
5,Calamity Jane,This was great! I wanted the book but did not want to pay $32. The service was great-quickly received and in very good condition. Thank you
5,Dont get it twisted,"This album is good hip hop, not main stream like Eminem. Mr. Capone-e Has made a long way, still drops those tunes for the ladies, keep representing."
5,Deeper Plot lines then I remember,"I remember this series as a student in fifth grade. I loved the space ships, loved the action, loved the wave motion gun. I bought it purely for nostalgia and recently watched it. I was impressed by the deep plot lines and sub-text that runs through out the show. The messages of duty, sacrifice and honor where all there, and as a child I was introduced to these concepts and I am sure it made an impression.You can grip about the transfer, and the American cuts (the parts that were cut out are floating around somewhere.) But you can't quibble with the story."
2,Decent,"This is a good fluff piece for Christians who are not serious wrestling fans. Unfortunatly if you are like me; a Christian who is a serious wrestling fan, it is lacking.There are numerous mistakes in dates, opponents, matches, locations and other things, that about 10 minutes of research could have resolved. While it is great to focus on these men finding Salvation through our Lord, if you are going to document their career's you could at least make an attempt to be accurate! Also, to write a book on the premise of it being a preaching tool a bit more research should have been done on each wrestler!The main problem with the inaccuracies is they will cause a hard core wrestling fan to lose interest in the deeper meaning behind the book."
5,CalciYum! A Must for Every Kitchen,"CalciYum! has been a blessing in my kitchen. Not only are the recipes delicious and the instructions easy to follow, but I also know that my daily calcium needs are being met. The book has a wonderful resource table that lists the amount of calcium in each of the ingredients. This way, I can even boost the calcium in some of my own recipes. With a nutritional analysis for every recipe, an ingredient cooking guide, and tasty recipes, I recommend this book wholeheartedly to anyone."
4,Eloquent if a bit brash,"I picked this up because I enjoy Frank's voice. The essays in this collection-- written to his ""peers"" in an attempt to explain America at his time definitely show a nice range. Frank occasionally writes so boldly that it can turn one off of the work, but in the last few essays, esp. New York, he hits his stride and writes some beautiful, flawless essays that perfectly define his times-- just before America's cultural explosion in the 20's-- and still hold true today."
3,Carnivors need not apply,"This is a good cookbook for vegetarians and relatively inactive ones at that. The meal plans in the back are based on about 1500 calories which would be about 700 or more deficient if you are relatively active.If you like meat, poultry or fish seek out a different cookbook.It does have desserts BUT many of the recipes state sugar substitute without giving any hints as to which of the many to use. Since they vary in sweetness and some are packaged as measure for measure equivalent to sucrose, having a recipe saying one packet or 1/8 tsp. may leave you under or over sweetened depending upon what variety you use."
5,Love this umbrella,I purchased this umbrella for the summer and I am impressed with it. It's easy to crank up and it's nice quality.
5,Very well made umbrella and extremely easy to use,"I purchased a couple of these umbrellas and am very impressed with their durability, as well as with their ability to block out the sun. The tilting feature is fantastic, as you can easily adjust the umbrella for various sun angles. The cranking mechanism works very smoothly and it takes just seconds to wind all the way up or down. One piece of advice would be not to leave the umbrella up during very windy conditions. I did so, and the umbrella fell over. Aside from that, it's a great product."
1,Not happy with this purchase,I received this product timely and packaged well. There is nothing wrong with the vendo's service. The product is too lightweight to withstand even the lightest wind and the crank stopped working right within a week. The umbrella rocked at the place where the two pieces of pole are screwed together. Each pole section has an insert that is pressed in that is a threaded piece and the weakness of this construction made us have to clamp this area to stop the movement. Then the joint at the tilt mechanism started shifing back and forth also. This umbrella is probably suited to an area that gets no wind at all. I made the mistake of disposing of the box too soon or I would have returned it. I would not purchase it if you have any wind over 5 mph.
1,Not worth it!,"This is a very lightweight umbrella and a disappointing product. The pole bent in two different places within a week of use and it no longer stands up straight. It's constantly getting knocked over by the wind and even the smallest breeze has sent it flying across my yard. While the umbrella looks great, I really wish that I had spent a bit more and bought a more sturdy product."
3,Nice umbrella but pole is small-won't fit into base,I like this umbrella but unfortunately the pole is so much smaller than the base that it won't stay securely in it. With that being said...any kind of wind the umbrella gets taken and flies away. It has not been damaged which is a good thing but I haven't been able to really use it. Live in a pretty windy state so any wind no umbrella. Might trying rigging something up to get it to stay in the base. Overall though..great product for the money.
3,It was ok.,"I liked the writing and the storyline. The descriptions were just deep enough to make the story believable, but not so deep as to annoy me. However, I really hated the main character. I found her to be weak and fearful and she whined an awful lot, especially for a vampire. In the end, the book was just ok."
3,Mis-named,"I am fortunate enough to have purchased this book used for 1/3 of the publisher price. Besides CRC Press publications being extremely over priced in fair market value, this book is nothing more than a nutrition terminology dictionary.On the positive side - the definitions are concise and it is clear why this publication would be useful to students in the university level.Do I regret my purchase? No, since I was able to get it for the price I did. Will I use it in my dietetic profession, yes. Could have I have done without it as a reference, sadly, yes."
2,Really worn....,Book came fast but was pretty much falling apart and had a lot of writing in it. No way for me to resale this product when my class is done.
2,"Get Words, Music, Pictures instead","This book told me more about ""Profit Techniques"" than picking techniques. Practically all of the material is excerpted from the (mostly excellent) transcription book ""Words, Music, Pictures"", and not even presented in a very logical context. The few sentences that specifically deals with picking, are just general remarks that aren't very helpful in the practical sense. From a picking wizard such as Al, I'd expected some killer exercises and top-notch advice, but this book was probably hastily assembled to capitalize on his name (I doubt he had much input on it at all). Nothing wrong with the transcription excerpts, except that they aren't really right-hand etudes, and you can get the full versions in the other book (WMP)."
4,Almost a shop manual,This book was a pleasant suprize. The black and white photos are pretty good. I would recommend this book for any 993 owner.
2,No color pictures,"I am disappointed in this book, which should have color pictures rathere than black and whites."
4,Cutting Edge Revisionism,"Searching, devastating analysis of French investigator J.-C. Pressac's attempts to shore up the Holocaust myth with Auschwitz blueprints and records long secreted in the Moscow archives. Mattogno painstakingly analyzes crematory records and capabilities, the ""testimony"" of Auschwitz commandant Höss, and a wealth of other documentation -- to convert the latest, most tangible evidence from the German concentration camp into hard, new nails hammered into the coffin of the Auschwitz lie. Cutting-edge Holocaust revisionism!"
1,Dont waste your money,"This book is a waste of money. It is pseudo science, full of miss representations and distortions. There has been a good rebuttal google it on internet to see it.As with all other holocaust deniers there is always a hidden agenda. They are apologists for the Nazi regime. Most are avid Nazi's or Neo Nazis and as such are enemies of freedom, enemies of civil rights, enemies of freedom of speech, enemies of womens rights and enemies of any people of colour. If they were in power we would soon see what they are like!"
2,it's okay I wound't recommend for cats,"I bought this because i like the idea of just spraying on pets. and the reviewers saying that it works.my experience was little different. first of all, the smell was really bad. when I was spraying on my cats, I got headaches by the smell.i though the smell will be gone after drying up. but it wasn't. it was still there forever, and i had to wash my cat after few days later.because my cat hair felt really oily and my cat looked like street cat after i sprayed this.I wouldn't spray this on furniture. i don't know not many people will able to stand this smell. i have on extra bottle that i bought but i don't think i 'll use that any more."
5,Excellent Vegan Once a Day Vitamin for a Great Price,"Rainbow Light Just Once Multivitamin is a very good once a day vitamin. It is food based, so that means it is better absorbed and utilized by the body than are synthetic/isolate vitamins. The balance of vitamins and minerals is good -- not perfect, but very good. It is vegan. The company issued the Vegan-Guard on the label. Note: the current photo on Amazon does not show the ""Vegan Guard""-- but when I checked, the UPC matched and the product is indeed vegan."
2,high absorption,"In use of these Multivitamin tablets, I found them to absorb other medications. I have therefore stopped use. Also very expensive"
1,severe fading issues,"I received this mailbox cover as a 2006 Christmas gift. It went out in my garden area in March and by the middle of April had faded to a light blue. I have tried repeatedly to contact the manufacturer and the phone message box is always ""full"" --no wonder if everyone else has the same problem I did. Maybe if these are kept indoors they are good but I sure did not have any luck at all with it lasting and holding the color in my yard.--Kathleen in KS"
3,Lean for Dummies,A short book which presents the basic principles of Lean Enterprise from the Toyota creation.
1,Save your money,"I do not understand the 5-star reviews. To me, this book was useless. I blame not the authors, but the editor. To me, the book seems to alternate rapidly between novice-level triva and material of interest only to the experienced security engineer (I work in system security). I simply can't imagine any one skill level or interest set for whom this volume would be appropriate. O Reilly's mark on a book used to be an assurrance of quality, but I advise the potential buyer to review this one before forking over your hard-earned money."
5,Great set,This a great table with 2 chairs. I put it in a small area of my kitchen and it works great...... When it came all the parts were there and it only took my husband just a few minutes to put it together.The color of the wood was great for my kitchen.
3,Not Bad Condsidering Its Price,"It was easy to assemble and it was within my budget. The table finish is great, but the table itself isn't sturdy. It can be wabbly. Over all an okay value."
4,Beautiful and Inexpensive - a worthwhile buy,"This is an excellent choice for someone on a tight budget. It is a beautiful and sturdy product for a low price. Mine arrived withing two weeks of ordering, and I have been very pleased with it so far. The only downside is the difficulty of assembling the piece. There are no pre-bored holes in the wooden componants, the guides marked on the underside of the table are unreliable, and the metal componants didn't fit together. It took me around 3 hours and quite a bit of sweat to get the entire set put together (granted, I did not have an electric screwdriver or drill, and I put the first chair together with the seat backwards and had to do it again. Be careful of that). This piece was a bit of work, but well worth both the money and the effort that went into it."
3,Pool cover,Cover is about same quality as covers I have paid twice as much for. Will be happy if it gets me through the winter. Looks to be a good value. Time will tell.
1,I'll be surprised if it makes it through the winter,"This 28' Diameter Winter Above Ground Swimming Pool Cover is supposed to have an 8 year Limited Warranty. It didn't come with any warranty paperwork.The product is VERY thin, it was pretty stretched out where you could see through some of the the fabric strands and had several of the gommets for the cable already ripped out of the cover fabric. I've bought cheap ones locally that looked more durable than this one.Maybe I got a dud, but I didn't have time to worry it. I needed to get the pool closed, so we did the best we could with."
2,Definitely not what I was looking for.,"I am a secondary school music teacher and was hoping to get tips from this book to help my students who really struggle with sight-singing. As a music teacher, I would like to tell you that this book takes an EXTREMELY BASIC approach. ONLY PURCHASE THIS BOOK IF YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW TO READ MUSIC AT ALL. I can see how this book would be helpful to someone who doesn't understand the concepts of note values, pitches, etc. But seriously, this book was no help to me nor my students at all, and will certainly not be to you if you have a basic understanding of sight-singing already."
1,Big Disappointment,"I read the other reviews and bought this CD player, thinking I had found a good player at a reasonable price. The player has skipped from the beginning. Often won't play CD's, but puts the ""error"" message up instead. Using the program buttons, or the search buttons, will cause it to stop playing every time. Guess I'll have to junk it and try to find something else."
5,Luv it,My favorites are kissing cousins and live a little love a little is a more mature Elvis love his so called love scene.the other 2 movies i keep going to sleep on
5,Great bargain for outdoor living,"I needed two umbrellas for the back yard, but couldn't really afford to spend a ton, and was wary of inexpensive umbrellas because they usually break in one season (or less!). These, however, are wonderful! They came within 4 days of purchase, and I had them shipped to work so I could get rid of the packaging material in our dumpster. They roll up and down easily, and the shade of dark green I chose looks great next to the patio furniture and my flowering garden."
2,"sad portrait of ""modern woman""","i was told i would love this show and bought the dvd and watched it and came away sad. here is the modern woman, in touch with her sexuality and life and decides to give up romance and love to stick with the thrill of being a whore. sad commentary on what we view as modern and independent these days, just sad"
3,Not as good as season one.,"this season did not hook me in as well as season one. Not sure why, but the episodes aren't as crazy in this season."
3,Good story adapt,"It tells the story well, and adds a human emotion to it that the game did not go into. Though, it seemed to rush at the end"
3,mmm...zombies.,"Don't be confused by the low rating. I liked this book, I really did. It gave you a little bit of insight on how the characters in the game were thinking. It was pretty true to the game, but I wouldn't recommend reading this book, or any in the series, if you have the intention of playing the games at some point. Reading book then playing the game is a no-no. It will ruin the unmatched expeirence of the games.Resident Evil-wise, the book was decent.Book wise, it was just a very long fanfiction put into book format. The writer has a style that reminds me of a teenage fanboy (or girl), but somehow it works for her. Read this if you have nothing better to do in an afternoon. You probably won't want to put it down."
2,NOT RELAXING,"I got this DVD for Christmas, and I'll have to admit, it's not one of my favorites. I am used to Bryan Kest and Rodney Yee, and I found this DVD too fast paced for a good stretch. I often have very sore muscles and like to sit in a pose for a while and work that stretch and this DVD doesn't allow that. It is a good DVD if you don't need much stretch and want a good workout sweat. I would say this is more for weight loss than relaxation."
5,A yoga practice to take you to the next level.,"An intelligent sequence of strengthening and stretching exercises, set to interesting but not intrusive music. Initially aerobically challenging, but within a week satisfying, fun, and relaxing. I own 6 Yoga DVD's, and this one is my favorite. Not for the practitioner looking to meditate or breathe incense!"
3,Not for a Primary Teacher,"This book has great info., but as a primary teacher I found the material hard to relate."
2,fakeraid,This is not an actual RAID controller. It is basically a SATA controller with software-RAID drivers.
4,Quick Release Works Pretty Well,"I got these collars after my dogs got their teeth intertwined in each other's collars more than once (they play rough). It's not easy trying to break up up a 100lb rottweiler his 50lb companion when their both panicking & stuck together yelping. I've found both collars loose around the yard from time-to-time which means they had enough force to yank them off. The bummer thing is that when we try to grab them by their collars (like when someone comes to the door), the collars pop off. I fear that they'll somehow get out of the yard and loose their collar with their tags but they are microchipped. There's more of a chance that they get hurt or choke while no one's home than there is for them to get out."
1,Almost burned down my new house.,"I never leave reviews and if I do it's on the positive side but I had to leave this one because if this light did damage to anyone's property I would feel bad.I purchased this about a week ago because it was cheap and it would give me extra light to do work around the house. I read the instructions, put it together and plugged it in. Within 5 minutes we smelt something burning and on a hunch I went over to the light and sure enough it was super hot. I quickly unplugged it to find that the front glass was completely shattered and parts of the paint were starting to melt. I know Halogen lights are hot but if we were not around this thing who knows what would have happened. The light is ruined and so are my spirits for this light. Great price, great service from Amazon but I would be scared to ever use one of these lights again."
2,Only one things ruins this book,"My Granddaughters mostly enjoy this book. It is well written and interesting. It helps encourage an interest in ""real"" genealogy - the history of what our ancestors were, not just who they were by some dry statistics.But the author's insistence on continually stating that her female ancestors did not go to war actually rubbed me the wrong way! And I am mostly a pacifist. Women did not go to war in the past. Making it sound like these amazing women were even more amazing for not going to war is disingenuous, and a slam on those fine men who did risk their lives during WWII, or other wars when they faced the draft.W#hen I read the book, the girls and I have agreed that I will simply leave that part out. They have grandfathers, and great grandfathers who risked their lives during several wars (WW II and Vietnam) We have appropriate discussions about the reality of war. They pretty much understand what the Gramps did and why."
5,Dum Dum Kicks Ass!,"This single is really good! It's really different from all the other bands. Compared to Blink 182 and Green Day, this band is totally different. It's not that heavy but it's really 100x catchy! If you're looking for a change from Green Day or Blink 182, please try Dum Dum. It's not that ""DUM"" after you listen to them."
1,"im pissed, false advertisment! i want my money back","iordered the product last week, just got it today, it was suppose to be a 5"" lift kit for a 07 f150. they sent me a 2"" kit for a 04 f150. i'm pissed and want my money back now. on top of that, it didnt even come with the u bolts! i cant even use it. 130 dollars and a week waisted.its the day after and i still havent heard anything or got a refund im pissed"
3,Classic Style Game,"This seems like its the game that never ends. The ""tutorial"" levels have taken me over an hour to get through because each of the turtles have there own special ability. Its one of those games where you can't really die you just restart from a save point."
1,Dont buy it!,this game should have the name of the jump turtles! you never fight with any boss until the end of the game!!!....i buy it cause i wanna feel my times when i played this game in the super nes. but really guys...this game its a sh....///
3,"Healthier, but not very thick","The puck will last you quite a long time, and will lather nicely on your face, but does not hold as thick a lather as other shaving soaps I have tried. For the price, there are no complaints; it is certainly worth that amount, but I will probably invest in more quality soap next time."
1,Piss poor at explanations,"This book sucks, plain and simple. DO NOT TRY TO LEARN FROM IT. They don't actually explain how to do anything and give confusing, if any, explanation of the examples. Then the back of the chapter exercises have retarded questions asking you to do stuff that they never explained how to do even. For example : ""Add, subtract, and multiply the following numbers without converting to decimal."" The most this was explained in the chapter is that it was possible, but never said how the freakin' hell to do it. Everything, all the fundamental concepts, are left to you, the reader, to figure out what the hell it is on your own. The most this book tells you is the names of the fundamentals."
5,Absolutely Delicious!,"I love chocolate, but I am on a low carb diet and the two don't mix. With this delicious sugar free chocolate available, I've been able to stick to my diet. It has an amazing flavor. It's sort of a cross between milk and dark chocolate. The bits of hazelnuts in the chocolate are so yummy. The fat content is up there, and each bar has 180 calories, so even though it's sugar free, you still wouldn't want to sit down and eat two of these a day, but if eaten in moderation, they are wonderful! I highly recommend these candy bars. I ordered an entire case."
1,Not Happy,"Add me to the list of unhappy ones. Second batch of ice cream and the motor went. Ridiculous to pay this amount of money for a freezer and have the motor quit. I might expect it from a $25 freezer. White Mountain use to be the best of the best for ice cream but now that the name has been sold to a ""group"" that only cares about money and does not care about the USA-has there product made overseas with shoddy workmanship- the product is not going to be recommended by me as it use to be! My freezer is on its way back for a refund of money. Think I'll try a cheaper brand of ice cream freezer. Looking for one made in the USA, so far have not located one."
1,Disappointed,My children purchased the White Mountain Ice Cream Maker as a Father's Day gift for my husband because after using my father-in-law's White Mountain their father was convinced it was the best one to own. Sadly the first attempt to make ice cream left us disappointed as the motor seiged early in the churning process. Though the company was happy to accept the churn back for a full refund we were very disappointed that we did not receive a churn equal to the one my father-in-law purchased years ago.
1,"Used to be good, now they make crap.","My first white mountain lasted some 25 years before the motor finally went. So of course I had to buy another one. Little did I know that the company had been sold and now the parts are made in china. This on lasted a little over a year and the gearbox broke. Thinking this was a fluke I bought another one . Big mistake as after about the 6th use the gearbox gave way again. Now I'm just pissed. Taking the gearbox apart it's clear of the cheap poor quality. The shaft that holds the primary gear is just cheap metal and there is no bearing , so the fast spinning gear just grinds the shaft down until there is so much slop that the gear will no longer stay engaged with the geared motor shaft.. Pure crap. White Mountain no longer stands for quality, look some where else or have someone custom machine a bearing for the primary gear shaft."
1,Video nasty,"I was forced to watch this when I was about twelve. Luckily I'm smart, so after a period of nightmares, I was able to work out that if the message of Christianity is so weak that they need to scare little kids into believing, the whole thing is probably a crock.The shame of it is that Christians tend not to be so smart (look around any congregation) and their kids mostly inherit their stupidity, so I guess a lot of them weren't able to brush off the message as easily as I did. Pure child abuse, committed by hypocritical church leaders who shoved this filth on us while condemning, for example, Philadelphia with Tom Hanks because of its sympathetic portrayal of an AIDS sufferer. Evil scumbags.Kids, if you're reading, it's all rubbish. Now go and have a beer and relax."
4,A Thought provoking wake up call to what may soon happen,This video has been around for over 25 years. At least that is when I first viewed it and found it to be so impressive that 25 years latter I want to use it as a tool to minister to my family and others as well. It involves three couples. One couple has accepted Christ into their lives and another couple laughs at the thought of a Savior. The third couple is questioning at first and then the husband accepts Christ. The rest will keep you on the edge of your chair
3,"nice to look at, but a little light for the price you pay","This is a nice glimpse at Adrian Tomine's sketchbook. It's not a full comic. Just a few dozen colored drawings of people that he's seen around the city, with notations about their mannerisms or the environment that he made the drawing.It's not a traditionally bound book. It's accordian folded so you can cut out the ones that you like, and put them on the wall or uh ... hang from your rear view mirror. You'd have to be a pretty hardcore fan to feel that $25 bucks is a fair price for the amount of material. Amazon's price is a little bit easier to swallow. a little."
4,Sweet and romantic.. excellent but..,"The attitudes that have been established by the characters in the previous 3 books do not stay true in this book. I realize with all the books having different authors that it would be difficult at best to guarantee the mannerisms stay the same. But that was my only complaint about this book. This was a sweet touching book about a man falling in love, with not only a woman, but her child. There were times I actually almost felt a tear coming on. I liked it, and would recommend it highly except for the one fault I touched upon."
1,Rip off Alert,"Do not spend your money on this product as you will find the popping ratio extremely poor. One cup of popcorn will have 1/2 cup of un poped (old Mades) kernels left over which is unacceptable.This is a non returnable item so if you buy this one you are just out of luck, so I recommend staying away from this one."
2,great popcorn terrible price for shipping,wE LOVED THIS POPCORN BUT COME ON SHIPPING IS WAY OVER THE TOP WE WOULD SETTLE NEXT TIME FOR SOMETHING WE CAN BUY BUT NOT SPEND 3 TIMES ON SHIPPING
1,Shipping is INSANE!!!,"I love the popcorn, but the shipping costs are INSANE!! A total rip off. Wabash Valley Farms or Amazon or whoever is charging the shipping is out of their mind. 5 Stars for the popcorn. Minus 4 stars for the terrible cost associated with shipping. Argh...Yes, the popcorn is tender and luscious, and it melts in your mouth like you're eating cooked grasshoppers, but come on!!! Can't you ship this product for less?Shipping the 6 pound bag is even worse. *sigh* Too bad really."
5,good popcorn,I love this popcorn. Only downside is the shipping and packing. Cost almost as much as the popcorn. Need to pack it better. Bag split and a bunch of loose popcorn falling out of the box when the guy brought it to my door.
2,"Too small, too much shell & not enough white fluffy part","I purchased the baby white by accident. We usually get the medium white, which is great. The baby is so small when popped that the taste and texture of the hull shell really overwhelm it."
5,SEEMS TO BE OF GOOD QUALITY,I USED THESE SNIPS TO CUT SIDING FOR MY HOUSE. THEY SEEM TO BE OF GOOD QUALITY. I CUT 14 SQUARES OF SIDING WITH THEM.
5,Of the Best of the PS1!,"I got this game as a gift during the Christmas of 99, and since that time it still is ranked as one of my top 10 favorite games! The graphics my be crap by todays standards, but this game had a great story, awesome gameplay, and (at the time) mind blowing us of the dualshock controller!Whether you've played this game before or not, if you want a trip down the nostalgic lane then play Ape Escape!"
3,Ape Escape,This game is way overrated A mediocre game at best poor graphics fair gameplay. Overall nothing special Nothing horrible
4,Pretty Good,"This game is alright. The way you can get new gadgets and need to go back through the levels is okay, but after you finish that there's zip to do. You can olny resort to the bad arcade games, which have unbelivably bad graphics. This game is compltely 2-D in some parts, which can get annoying. It's better to rent this game than buy it."
5,Great Book,"It only took me three days to read it, great book i will buy the next book in the series...."
1,"Malo, realmente malo","Este libro no ofrece nada, ni en el campo financiero, ni en el campo filosofico. La mejor inversion que puede hacer, es ahorrarse la plata de comprar este libro."
3,magnet does not last,I got it about a year ago and the magnet has already become so weak that the mitt will not stay on the fridge... Beware.
2,Where's The Other One,Maybe it's just me but when I bought this I just assumed there would be 2 ... one for each hand! Makes no sense to me why anyone would only want one. The one I received looks good but I haven't eally tried it yet. Still trying to understand why one one ... ? Would have given 2 1/2 stars because it seemed appropriate. The one I received I would rank it at the top due to my first impression. Can't exactly rate the second one so that one scored a zero.
4,"Grips well, and comfortable to use.","I bought this mitt as a replacement for an old-school fabric model by KitchenAid which had been left on the hot stove plates a few too many times. I like it - inside, the lining is soft and has a bit of padding, but not too much that you can't grab with it. The outside is an interesting blend of silicone with grooves, strategically placed so that it helps to hold on to what you're grabbing that much better. (If you've ever used an Orka mitt, you know how hard it is to really grab things sometimes.) The entire hand portion of the mitt is covered in the silicone, so it's just about as workable as other silicone mitts when using it on wet items.I like this mitt and would recommend it. The magnet in the wrist is a nice feature as well - I place it on the side of my oven so it's always nearby when I need it."
5,One of the best career and life tools I ever purchased!,"I attended a workshop given by Mr. Mercer many years ago. His advise and his book remain one of the best resource tools I have. It has great advise and tools for communicating with co-worker, clients, board members and the butcher! The most valuable tools have to do with understanding your and the other person's communication style. One of the most common sources of frustration in dealing with people is not adapting or flexing your personal communication style to ""understand"" the messages being sent by the other person. And more importantly, people often want to receive information in a differnt manner than how they ""give"" information. Buy the book! It has been a must read for every person I have ever had the pleasure to train. Most are now senior staff members in their respective professions. I like to think Mr. Mercer and I had both had a hand in their success!"
5,RIVETING!,"I watched series one and series two was no disappointment. I could go on and on about how fabulous this was. I planned to watch it over several weeks. I hate to admit this, but I sat down in front of the tube for hrs every night and finsihed in a week! I couldnt wait to get home to watch it !I can name this review / show in one word....riveting!"
1,Dont buy this nailer,"This nailer is not working at all.. after few shots it stopped working and we had power outage. We are afraid to use this product, we dont want any harm or damage caused. The product is very low quality and not safe to use."
1,Unit quit working,"Unit never worked right. Only drove 1.25"" brads about an eight inch into the wood. Unit completely quit after just a few attempts. Stay clear, this is a really cheap product. Don't know if I'll ever see my money again. Attempting to return."
1,A piece of junk,"I absolutely agree with those who gave one star reviews. This is a piece of junk. I used it first time trying to nail pine molding to the window, tried four or five nails, none of them went all the way in. Second time I tried it on birch wood, after two/three nails, it went completely dead. I have never bought a tool this poor quality. I don't know if I should get it fixed, because it could be just waste of money."
4,Java 2 for Dummies is GREAT!!!,"I'm a college student working on a programming degree and I will say that this book is EXCELLENT!!! Featuring an easy to follow no non-sense format, I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn Java without the complicated text book aspect!!!"
2,Definetly not for AP Computer Science,"This book, unlike c++ for Dummies as many other people have told me is definetly not a good book for reviewing over the AP Computer Science test. This book barely cover half of the A topics for the test, the easy one too like objects and arrays. This book may be good if you are just trying to learn java as a hobby but this book is definetly not good for the AP test. If you are learning then get Barron's guide to ap, if you are reviewing get barron's and maria litvin's."
4,Are you sure this is her second album?,"She sings with the best of them,is produced by an all star team of producers and can worship and praise with the greatest of ease. My question again is: How can she be so good for only her second album. A must have."
1,No Videos Available,"The reason the Disney MP3 was so appealing to me is that they supposedly have movies that you can buy on a chip. I was able to buy ONE movie (High School Musical) and have not been able to locate any more titles. When I contacted Disney, they said they are not available. My kids were really disappointed. Now they have 1 movie to watch on their new Mix Max. I should have stuck with the Mix Stick."
4,inexpensive celery flakes,Hard to find in supermarkets (checked three different chains and none had it) and VERY expensive. Great deal and good service.
1,bug in products,Went to use and found that there were bugs flying around the container! Will not buy again ever! Contacted Marshall's two week ago and not a return call or email. will never purchase again ever!
4,A Really Great Movie,"This was so good. I loved it. It's about Nanny and her story (told by a young man who was raised by her). Macy Gray and Jimmy Smits were two of the more known people to star in this, but Nanny took the cake. She was amazing and what an actress. I wished this movie was a little longer, because it was so enjoyable and over before I knew it. You'll enjoy the music too - it's really beautiful."
5,Light weight and small,It gets hot and thats to be expectedthe stand that is!! As fare as the stove is concerned it works great and lives up to the hype on u tube
5,One of Disney&#65533;s Best Golden Books,"The artwork in this book is very colorfully attractive and true to the Disney's Jungle Book movie. It is amazing that so much detail was put into the illustrations.Another excellent feature about this book is how well the story was condensed from the film. It's almost all here. Often the Golden Books base their stories from segments taken from the movie. That is not the case here.The story of Mowgli, the man-cub, befriended by the animals of the Jungle in India comes to life in concise and easy to read words. Bagheera the wise panther, Baloo the bumbling bear, and all his other jungle friends are all here as they make their way to the man-village. Mowgli saves the day by fending off the sly tiger, Shere Khan.This is a very good book."
5,New Beginning,I love my new video and the timeliness in which I received it. I will definitely use this vendor again!
1,Buyer Beware,"It is my own fault. I bought this book on the strength of the earlyreviews, failing to notice, for instance, that this...""book"" is a 33 page pamphlet that contains no specificcontent related to what one needs to know to pass the Series 7 exam. I mistakenly thought I was buying an exam prep book. If you need a pep talk to keep you focused on studying for the Series 7 exam, then perhaps this publication will be of use to you. But I doubt it. In light of the dearth of decent, resonably priced, study guides to Series 7, I had hoped this would fit the bill. It didn't.... END"
1,Mediocre at best,"One great thing about book reviews is that they give you insights into what you can expect from a piece of literature. I found many of the reviews for this book to be totally misleading. If you buy this book, you will buy a book that is very poorly written. Every paragraph is littered with gramatical errors. I could overlook the technical errors if there was an underlying message that I found useful. I looked over the 18 pages of text that is this book and couldn't find one piece of information that was useful. I'll sum up the book for you and I won't even charge you for it: you can do it, don't study for long periods of time, you can do it, drink lots of water, you can do it, think of happy places, you can do it. This book was a complete waste of time and money."
4,Great kit...big kit,"This kit has had all the necessary taps and dies I've needed. Only complaint is how big the case is (they could have used the lid and shrunk the size in half). All things considered, I would buy it again."
4,good size coverage at a reasonable price,"With a good range of thread sizes covered, this is a great set to have on hand for touching up an old thread or tapping a new one. Taps and dies cut easily and yield a smooth thread that fits accurately with standard nuts and bolts. The set lacks i[...]if you are in any doubt or need to refresh your memory. It would also help to have included a better drill size reference but, again, the internet can fill that gap - [...]."
4,Big box,"Just got this and everything looks good, it is just that the case is twice as big as it needs to be. My dad has something similar and the case is half the size or less. This case is the size of a briefcase pretty huge for the amount products inside, it makes for hard storage."
3,OK,The product is good but the so called super savings is sorta fake. You can actually get this tap set at home depot for less and it is not even on sale for them. I was disappointed in the savings because I sorta rush ordered the product because I thought I was getting such a good deal and a limited time offer. I did the research and found out that the price was pretty much average or comparable to everywhere I looked.
5,This book will make a difference in your bottom line!,"Covers all types of retail loss problems, in depth, and accurately. If you are a loss control/prevention professional and want to see a program that will work, a training program that can be implemented..I would highly recommend this book. Not only does he outline the problem, but provides workable solutions that will fix it."
4,give it sixty pages and you'll be hooked,there are so many threads to this highly entertaining and ultimately compelling blackish comedy that you may well find yourself wondering what on earth is going on after forty or so pages. i urge you to persevere. the threads soon begin to intertwine and what quickly emerges is an affectionately written and brightly amusing thriller-of-sorts with unexpected twists aplenty and enough memorable scenes to make a pretty good movie (in fact i think they're making it into a movie right now - i vote that rufus sewell should play lorimer).
3,Not one of his Great Books,"William Boyd has written some great novels, but unfortunately this isn't one of them. The characters are well developed, believable and it does become important what happens to them , particularly Lorimer, however the twists and turns in the plot lack tension and suprise. In comparison with the books I've really enjoyed, Ice Cream War, A Good Man in Africa,The Blue Afternoon where there were always developments in the plot that were unexpected and created a tension in the plot that pushed on to the next resolution.This book has a similar, recognisable structure, but there aren't quite enough ""unpredictable"" suprises that put it up with the greats. I look forward to the next novel with hopes of a return to ""Greatness"""
2,Not what I had hoped for.,"Whilst I can see and appreciate the main themes within this book - being afraid to be yourself and the absurdity of the British class system. I didn't really feel like I got to know any of the characters that well. The twist and turns of the plot seemed pretty far fetched to me. I found it more sad than amusing. Perhaps it speaks more to men than to women, I wouldn't recommend this book to a friend."
1,Conversations With Pioneer Women,"This book was in extremely poor condition and should never have been listed as 'good' condition. Binding is very bad, pages are loose and ones that are still attached to the spine break loose as soon as you turn the page. Had the condition been listed appropriately, I never would have purchased."
2,Lower quality,There are 4 strings that hold the tunnel up inside a cage. Unfortunately two of them broke so the tunnel isn't able to hang. All my sugar gliders did was sleep in the tunnel. There were no chew marks or scratches on the strings.
4,Good Product,"Smaller than I thought it would be, but my ferrets enjoy messing with it and it's easy to clean :)"
2,Really not very good,"If you want your amp to sound like a Tascam cassette 4-track from 1993, this is the pedal for you."
1,Misleading,There was no grip. All metal. Disappointed to say the least. They even have 2 videos showing it with the blue and yellow grip. Again mine came with no grip at all.
5,Terrific book!,"This is a book I find myself reading again and again just because it's so entertaining. The breed information is accurate, as would be expected from Brian Kilcommons, but the presentation is often ""howlingly,"" laugh-out-loud funny. This is a great book for anyone who loves dogs, and mutts in particular."
5,Great!!,The reeds arrived sooner than promised and thet was very much appreciated because my son was down to his last reed!!
3,Beware of what's really included here,"If you read the description, you would believe there is a 1/2"" bit in there, but if you zoom in on the picture, you can count all 15 bits, and there is obviously nothing bigger than 3/8"" there.UPDATE -- Good news, it's seems the description has been updated and there is no longer any mention of a 1/2"" bit. Good job."
1,Severe psychological damage.,"Oh yes, I was forced to watch it as a child. Yes, I had nightmares for years. Yes, I believed that if I didn't do everything JUST PERFECT that God would abandon me and the United Nations would chop off my head with a guillotine behind a church.The decapitation scene was HORRID HORRID HORRID and this movie absolutely terrified me as a child. It did not bring me closer to God- it drove me away. This film is NOT appropriate for children. I literally looked over my shoulder for YEARS after seeing this film. Therapy? Yep- three years of it."
4,Great economy scale>,"this is a great scale for the price. mine was less than twnety bucks including shipping. unlike higher priced scales, this one is a bit slow to measure (2-3 second for weight correction) changes in weight. thats about the only complaint. otherwise it is accurate and reliable. for twenty dollars this is a great buy."
4,"Angels, Devils and the parents who love them!","This book was not at all that I would imagine it to be! It was kind of scary, so i had to read it in the daylight! This story was about two twins- One good and one very, very bad! Their names were Angela and Diabola. Angela means angel, and she was obviously the good one. People's hearts melted when they saw her and it made other mothers jealous. Diabola, on the other hand, was a complete Devil. She slept in a cage, wished that people would die and drew gory, disgusting pictures. The story contniues until the girls get to kindergarden.They soon discover that they have special powers. But with Diabola, this could be a problem. Can Angela stop Diabola before its too late? Or will Diabola destroy the city? Read Angela and Diabola, by Lynn Reid Banks and find out!"
4,Nicely read & enjoyed by an 8 year old,"We purchased the audiobook version of this book. It was an interesting story that my 8 yo loved, but my 6 yo was somewhat frightened by it(and he's not frightened by much lately). The characters are very interesting, deeply drawn and the relationship between the ""good"" twin (Angela) & ""bad"" twin (Diabola) is complex & rich. The reader did an excellent job (very important in an audio book). In addition, the layers of the story were sufficient for my husband & I to enjoy the book as well (we listened on a long car trip).The only reason I gave this 4 stars was the fact that my 6 yo was too young for some of the content, making this book not appropriate for all ages."
4,Amazing book!,"If you were a mother with twins it could be hard.But imgiane ifyou were Mrs.Cuberson-Jones!One as an angel called ""Angela"" and another as a devil called ""Diabola"".Watch out for Angela's beauty and Diabola's devilness. With a lot of 'twinnish', a language which is used by the twins to communicate, Diabola talks to Angela because she does not know how to speak a lot of English. But when they go to school the principal thinks Diabola is a genius. But wait till she makes her funny mistake! Watch out for a ton of fun!"
3,Does the job....,"I used the wireless remote to plug into my router which is in a room upstairs, so the kids can't sneak onto the internet at times they should not be on.It works from one floor below in turning the router on and off. The only issue is that the remote button does not indicate whether it is in the ON mode or OFF mode......therefore you have to check each time to confirm..."
2,Worked....Kind of!,Bought this to turn on outside lights. Worked well till the weather became colder. Then would only work occasionally.I use it indoors now and does what it's supposed to.Disapointed that it wouldn't work in the cold (says it works great for Xmas lights) but for the price what can you expect...
3,Does not work for plasma lamp on a DC adapter,"I purchased this for an old Lumisource 12 inch tall plasma lamp with a big DC adaptor. I had to tape the adaptor on as it would fall out of the socket of the Skylink base unit otherwise. The base unit has about a 1 cm lip around three sides of the socket that prevent a good snug fit for the boxy adapter. It DOES TURN ON THE LAMP but it does not turn it off. At least it does two of the three things I got it for. First it seperates the lamp from the household current so that the adapter does not get warm even when the lamp is turned off and suck up electricity needlessly. Second, it allows me to plug the lamp into an interior wall outlet located behind a big piece of furniture in a small room where the adaptor would demmand extra space. Too bad it only turns the lamp on. I have to turn it off then on again at the lamp's switch to reset it. It works great with my standard AC plug appliences but I did not get it for any of them."
4,"works through walls, ceilings, and desk","used to reset a cable modem and router, this works as advertized. only con is that the plug doesn't accomodate our flat desktop style surge protector console (had to purchase a short 6-inch extension cord)"
1,Bad reception,"I purchased this item based on some of the reviews and was concerned about reception. It was to replace a 10 year old unit that I believe was suffering from age...the reception had dropped off. I suggest steering clear of this unit, it was fine for the first two weeks and now you must be less than 10 feet away for it to work. I replaced the battery, nothing changed."
1,Ordered two - one was DOA,"I ordered two of the WS100As for an indoor application and one of them was DOA. I called Amazon for a return but the product was out of stock by then, so I asked to return them both (and still have not heard back from Amazon BTW). I instead ordered an equivalent product from Intermatic, and they both work great."
1,Lacks advertised range,"The unit was advertised to work at 100 feet as I walked up to the unit clicking it on after each step it finally turned on at 21 feet,totally worthless for my application, yes I'm returning it."
5,The best remote control outlet,"This is the second switch I have purchased, but this time I choose channel B, because I have a channel A within the same house area. I have try 3 other different brands remote control outlet, this is the only one perform the best, for around 45 feet and go through walls, still work, haven't fail once. The channel A I have since a year ago, still going strong on the remote battery. Good product and I recommend it."
4,Now it works correctly,The remote would not work over 6-10 feet.Customer service mailed me a replacement that day.All is fine.
4,Good unit.,"Ordered two of these from Amazon. Figured I may find a couple of uses for them. However, they are all on the same frequency. No way to change.So, if you have two applications within 100-150' of each other, one will turn the other on and vice-versa.No big deal as now I have one unit driving my alarm with two transmitters.Another quirk I want to share with you is that the receiver (big box), must be mounted vertically on a wall with the mains jack (what you'll plug your device into) pointed down! So, I guess that means you cannot leave it laying on the floor (?).My only guess for this requirement is that there is a mercury-whetted relay inside that needs the mercury at a certain point. Cannot hazard a guess of what may happen if mounted other than their requirements (?)This would be a good thing for the mfg. to touch upon in their blog above.Otherwise, good unit and a good value."
2,You have to press 1-8 times to work,"It just kind of sucks to have to wait 2-10 seconds to get the receiver to respond to you pressing On or Off for a light in a dark room...I had bought another one 2 years ago on Amazon, a different one, but similar.. That worked fine for a year until the battery ran out and I replaced the battery 3 different times but it never worked reliably again.This one seems worthless as well, luckily it wasn't too expensive.. I am trying another brand next but think one i've used before so I think it'll work :)"
1,Caution with this item,"This item is very unreliable, the distance that the device can detect a signal is very short, not as advertised. The device is not weather proof. After 1-2 weeks the device was not functional.I would not purchase this item."
3,It works...,"It works but the range is really short... even with line of sight the best I can get is about 25' It does work, but I found a much better unit for a few bucks more.... and the range on it is anywhere in the house... could not find any location on my property that it still did not control the unit and it has the option of up to 4 different channels for the wireless to eliminate conflicts."
2,Interesting but there are much better books available,"This is an interesting subject and LaHaye has some good insights, but overall this book is underwhelming. For starters, his system of classification and division of the temperaments is not even internally coherent. Then his descriptions of the four temperaments are inconsistent and overlapping. For the best book on temperament and personality type readPlease Understand Me IIby David Keirsey instead. One positive aspect of the book is the combination of psychology and Christianity. When we are filled with the Holy Spirit, we can overcome many of our weaknesses. However, much of his advice is too general or theoretical. For a more practical book combining Christianity and psychology, readEscaping the Matrixby Greg Boyd and Al Larson."
3,slow flow??,"I often hear of yoga studios offering a ""slow flow"" yoga class, but I haven't been able to find any ""slow flow"" DVDs. I've seen music CDs for ""slow flow"" but no videos. I was hoping this DVD would be ""slow flow,"" but it's just vinyasa (flowing yoga) to me. Can anyone recommend a good ""slow flow"" DVD?"
3,Good for beginners; skip it otherwise,"If you are just getting into Yoga, I recommend this DVD. It gives clear, concise instruction, teaching you Yoga-speak, without taking forever to explain the poses.The moves flow, the overall tone of the program is meditative, and if you are a beginner, this is a good way to start toning your body and increasing your strength and flexibility.However, for someone who has been practicing Yoga for at least a year, you will want to find something much more challenging. I was disappointed that my body did not even warm up - I didn't ""feel the burn"", and spent the work out as cold as if I were sitting on a couch doing absolutely nothing.I find the setting a tad bit sparse - it could use a little softening up, but overall the lighting and mood are excellent.Yee's narration is flawless.Beginners - go for it. Intermediate - look for something more challenging."
3,Not what I expected,"I thought the video would be much more challenging (as the name implies), but it was fairly easy. I hardly felt a ""burn."" I recommned it to beginners-intermediates, but if you are fairly flexible and looking for a challenge, don't bother with this video. Also be aware that it's an hour long."
3,Yoga Burn,I bought this video on the recommendation of two of my yoga students. The video was good. It was slower than most which is nice to see. I did find that once you got to the final pose you were already moving out of it. I will practice with this video in the future but probably save it for a day that I am feeling a little slower.Rodney does have a nice soothing way of explaining the poses and of course he demonstrates beautifully. If you do get bored with this video just sit back and enjoy the sight of Rodney Yee.
3,Just ok,"I definitely loved his Power Yoga, this dvd was just ok. I expected maybe longer reps/holds. But I'm still a fan of Rodney Yee so will still try other of his dvds."
4,Great Yoga DVD,"I recently bought this yoga DVD and have quickly become a huge fan of Rodney Yee. I have been taking yoga classes casually for the past 5 years but this was my first dvd purchase. While Yoga Burn does not necessarily make you sweat this is a real workout if you concentrate and wonderful for posture and increasing flexibility. You feel the workout in your legs, arms and abdomen for the next few days. Instructions are easy to follow if you are familiar with basic yoga poses. The only thing problem is he doesn't focus on breathing so you need to remind yourself or be very conscious of breathing through the poses. Overall, highly recommended."
1,No closed captions!,"I am giving this a one-star because this DVD was not closed captioned. I would like to again caution that from my experience with two DVDs from this company, probably none of the DVDs from this company (Gaiam) are captioned. If you are looking to buy captioned DVDs online, I recommend double-checking with the manufacturer's website."
1,Perfectly horrible and a waste of money.,"The Canadian psychologist posing as a semi-pro gambler has, again pulled the wool. Stealing Charles Einstein's simple but powerful count system, he renamed it HiOpt, then HiOpt1. Fortunately, he had Julian Braun calculate the change indices so they are reliable. Of course, he only presents indices from -6 to +6, then only for single deck. But, if you send him money, you may get something closer to what you actually need.In the text of the book you'll find useless platitudes and tired generalizations, some of which may be slightly true. The book is full of absurd accusations of cheating. When Mr. Wonderful wins he is a brilliant strategy player; but when when he loses he's been cheated? One might think that he must have spent more than a hundred hours at the tables lifetime, but the quality of the writing says otherwise. Save your money. Humble is a phoney, but he's made good money in peddling printed tripe."
3,This book is a worth while read but...,"This was the first book I read on blackjack and overall it provided a thorough description of how to play the game, outlined basic strategy using tables and desciptions, and a coherent explanation of Hi-opt1 counting strategy. What it didn't do is provide sound reasoning for using the hi-opt1 counting system over the more common, and in my opinion simpler, braun method. The book also fell short in how it explains betting correlation. It gave a textual description of how to do it with a few short paragraphs but then spent most of a chapter discussing how to mask your bets. The emphasis on betting correlation seemed to get lost among a lot of ""covert ops"" to disguise your card counting. Many of these secret methods are useless until you actually learn how to correlate your bets anyway."
5,Stan Freberg: Tip of the Iceberg,"Brilliant use of music & wit, rather like a Spike Jones with fangs. Very worthwhile for anyone who hooked up with Americans music since the 50s. Billy May's orchestra and the other musicians terrific. Half the price on Amazon compared with ordering from your local shop !"
2,merely ok,"My dad loved Stan and I grew up listening to the occasional record of his hits. I really enjoyed many of the skits on those LPs (especially the first few ones on the history of the US). This collection has pretty much everything I enjoyed as a kid, but the other stuff is not so good. The tracks I enjoyed are the second half of disk 1 and the first half of disk 3. I'm going to give this to my dad and hopefully he enjoys it more than me."
4,"Good camera, but one complaint...","No reason to not like this camera. It performs wonderfully and I've gotten some great results from it.The only problem is that it drains the battery like an alcoholic on a bender drains his liquor cabinet. If you take the camera with you on a trip or something be sure you have a fresh battery in it and a couple of spares.Also, the dial that turns it off and on can too easily be moved by the slightest brushing against any case you put the camera in. Too many times I have turned the camera off and put it in its case, only to find out later that the on/off dial got messed with and the camera was turned on and the battery drained. Not a flaw, exactly, but something to be careful with when handling the camera or putting it away."
4,Highly recommended,Catches your attention from the start. Looks like another Robin Cook and Michael Palmer. Looking forward to her future books.
4,not as it is pictured,"The skin is fine, but it is one color. This is not a two toned product. If you are looking for the two tone, but a diffrent skin"
2,Less quality than original,This is fine material.. really it is not the same quality than original cover skin.
1,DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!! BUY IRONCLAD!!!!!,i Bought several different styles of Irwins gloves and they all fell apart within a week. Spend your money on any style of ironclads gloves and they will last 10 times as long.....
1,Terrible Product,I had to continue to send back this product because it wouldn't work. I ended up going through 4 before I gave up entirely. This product is NOT reliable and I didn't even want to give it 1 star.
1,Dead in one week.,My title is my review. The thing worked for a week. After that it wouldn't power up anymore. Chinese junk.
1,Limited Life,"Works great at first! But just over a year later... it bit the dust. Hmm.... ironic.... the Warranty only covers the first year. I would have thought I just recieved a bad one, but then I was over at a friends house, and we wanted to watch a movie, but his RF modulator stopped working a few weeks prior. Low and behold... same exact model and same exact symptoms. The red light turns off after being plugged in for 1 second. If you want something that will last for less than a year, get this, otherwise, get something other than RCA."
5,Great item,"I had a 1995 tv that could not be hooked up to my Ps2. then, i got this, and it worked like a charm. VERY VERY VERY easy to use and install, and most importantly, it just plain works. Inlcudes the coaxial cable required to hook to tv. The instruction guide is useless, but honestly, you dont need it"
2,Not worth the money,The CD arrived in excellent conditons and promptly. The merchandise is not worth the money. Too much of the original story is missing in the interest of cramming it in one CD. Will leave you with a lot of questions on how did sherlock homes arrived at his results. Your imagination will not be enough to fill out the gaps in the narrative.
3,An average camera,"I had this camera for several months, and the results are mixed. Sometimes I am very pleased with the photos, but other times they come out very blury, especially under low lighting. Sure, a tripod helps and many of the manual controls help, but I am mostly interested in taking pics of my kids, which requires a camera to snap descent pics w/o all the hassle. In the end I decided on a higher-end camera with optical stabilization --- Canon S3 and have been very satisfied with it. All the research in the world can still lead you to the wrong camera... in the end what matters is a retailer with a generous return policy."
2,Canon Powershot A630 8MP Digital CAmera,"Received the camera quickly. I needed it for a vacation I was taking and it worked well for the first 2 weeks. It did malfunction the last day of my vacation by not opening properly, so only had small slit which was exposed to my shots. Small disappointment, but I hope to rectify this with the warranty or with Amazon.I have always been satisfied in the past with my purchases from Amazon.Canon PowerShot A630 8MP Digital Camera with 4x Optical Zoom"
1,Chronic focus problem,This camera has a serious focusing problem. It has nothing to do with light or moving the camera. This camera also runs through a set of four batteries in less than a couple of days. This product is unreliable and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.
3,Indoor shots are so grainny,I bought this camera A630 to upgrade from my old A95 camera. Sport shooting mode is not availble with the new A630 camera unlike the A95. I'm so disappointed with the indoor shots so grainny and poor in details and clarity. New camera suppose to be better than the older ones but unfortunately this is not the case. If you plan to take a lot of indoor shots then you should not buy this camera A630.
4,Too much noise,"The cam is not so bad for usual circumstances using flash light, but for me as an designer there is too much noise. Even when I set ISO to 80 with still images and long exposure time, there is noise that overlays too much of the resolution, using a camera that has a 4 megapixel resolution if it makes very clean noiseless images the result is as good or better then that of the powershot 630 / 8 MPixel, but with that much of noise all the megapixels are useless. Generally it needs a lot of light to make it a minimum of noise but its still there."
3,"Good value, but garrish color by default","For the price, this is a very good camera. My main gripe is (or was) the way the color is punched up. With the default setting, the saturation is outlandishly high. I paint in oils. When I used the camera to take pictures of my pictures, the portraits looked like people with bright red lipstick and clown dots on their cheeks. Sunny skies looked almost bright purple rather than cool blue. Eventually I discovered that there's a ""neutral"" setting that's not the default. It's much better, but still somewhat too saturated. I would recommend that if you want natural looking images, use the ""neutral"" setting and set the white balance manually rather than using one of the presets."
2,I'm getting rid of this camera.,"I went from the Olympus C-5050 (not a point & shoot but not professional either) to the Canon A630. I like to take a lot of natural light pictures and this camera absolutely stinks for this. The flash doesn't produce a lot of light and the natural light pictures are uselessly blurry even when I brace it on something to hold down movement. I've been very unhappy with this camera in every indoor setting, shaded outdoor setting but I have been happy with it outside.I wanted a lighter camera to take fun shots with but even my fun shots like the llama show I went to.. are pretty much useless. I'm going to be getting rid of this camera. I've taken hundreds of pictures on it and it's just making me madder every time."
4,Smoked Glass Casing for Outdoor Camera Use,The casing is execellent and was fairly easy to assemble and wire for use. It is a very heavy item and needs a stong place to be hung (and strong installers:). The only bad part is the smoked casing which makes the picture received look dark way before it is close to dark outside. Wrote the company an email to find out how to get the smoked glass replaced with a clear glass and got no response at all. Wrote two separate people noted at the company site. No part number listed in the paperwork and could not find the part after multiple searches.
3,An Old Fashioned Story,The Little Island by Golden MacDonald and Leonard Weisgard is a simple fantasy fiction story about a small quiet island. In it we learn about all the creatures that call the island home. In a relaxing way the book also moves through days and seasons. The old fashioned illustrations make the reader think of pictures in their mind. This book would be great for first and second graders who love nature.
3,Perfect!,Works as expected. No need to buy the OM at their ridiculous prices. This one works perfectly! I would definitely recommend this product to other Wii'ers.
4,Great deal but shipping is too risky...,"FInally I saw these sold by amazon and not a third party seller which would charge so much on shipping you could get two more sets. SO i jumped to get these from amazon, good deal esp. with free shipping. I give this four stars because when this fragile set ships it is extremely vulnerable to breakage. I don't think it's amazon's fault, they're probably not meant to be shipped. And that is what happened to my set. Went and got this set from the store to go with my existing set of Sango Black dishes, bowls, mugs."
2,wrong size,They are not 16 oz. Ther are more like 18.5 oz. Which maybe OK for home use. I sent them back.
2,Poor quality,"I bought these bowls for a gift, they are beautiful but the handles are very fragile. I had them sent to me twice, and both times one bowl came with a broken handle."
1,Broken,I really truely wish I would read reviews and stop ordering from Amazon.All four pieces are broken. One in tiny bits. Stupid me just opened the package from a month ago!
5,A Great Help,"This book is a must-read for anyone who is dealing with the loss of a family ""pet"". I read this book following the traumatic loss of my dog and it was truly comforting."
3,So-so.,"Some of the stories/characters are mentioned in the Amazon.com review. I looked forward to this book and was for the most part disappointed. The Judge Whitney-Cody McCain stories are the best of this bunch, but that being said can't Cody move on to another love interest? None of the rest did much in the way of holding my interest, making me care or engaging my emotions/imagination. Three stars are what I give any book that's readable and that I finish. Why three stars then? Well mostly because I like a lot of Ed Gorman's short stories and these just didn't appeal to me-you might like them. And, I did finish the book."
3,More a social commentary than a true archealogical work.,"Being a lover of all things ancient Roman, from the Latin language to the classical culture and also being a longtime student of Latin and Mandarin, I was very much looking forward to this book.However, from the viewpoint of the anticipated content of this book, and its actual contents, I was disappointed. I was expecting a 'blow by blow' description of the search for the ancient Roman heritage of Li-Jien (the Roman influenced towns of ancient China) and its discovery; but instead it was more of a 'how to survive in China on $10 a day' book combined with social commentary and an insight into the author's lovelife. As an Australian myself (the author is Australian), I was hoping for more.However, disregarding the above, it was still an enjoyable read; but not what I wanted when I purchased the book.This in mind, would I buy it again: yes; hence the 3 stars."
3,It will do.,"I bought the item because the Starbucks, where I have coffee every afternoon, is not well illuminated. As I am almost an octegenarian, this interferes with my reading the Wall Street Journal. I became acquainted with the above item because my son gave a cheaper version, at Christmas, to all the grandchildren. I was intrigued and when I told him of the problem, he recommended the above version as being better suited. He was correct, though at times, when in use, it shuts down when it should stay on. I was able to diagnose the problem as due to my head movements, or general vibrations in the area, slightly shifting of one or more of the batteries so they loose contact. It's annoying, but could be easily corrected by the manufacturer.Joseph Findling"
4,Lace up shoes and book review,"I am very happy with the way my ordering process went when I ordered my lace up shoes. However, I ordered a dance book at the same time and i have not received it. I am very very upset about this. I have already paid for it, and it has been over a month since I ordered the book."
3,Not what I ordered,"I ordered the Irwin 341008 Speedbor set of 8 pieces because of the larger sizes it contained. I received a substitute set of more pieces but it did not contain the larger sizes I was looking for. I had to go to the Big Box store to get the sizes I needed. Guess I should have gone there in the first place. Although the substitute set was not what I ordered, it was a nice set. I kept it."
2,MEDIOCRE,"I see that Mr. Harvey is capable of doing a funny show without profane language, but overall this one wasn't all that great for me. Certain parts were pretty funny. His skit with Rickey Smiley on stage was lame. The whole ""I'll kill your whole family"" comments were definitely not funny. Quite disturbing actually."
4,Steve Still Got It Without Profanity!,"I saw Steve's latest Don't Trip... and I must say that the boy is still a nut without all the profanity and foul language. I listen to his daily morning radio show and he has me laughing so hard that I literally have to pull over and wipe the tears from my eyes. Don't Trip touches on reality and things that we as normal ""church folk"" can relate to. When it comes to laughter and craziness and those mmm huh stories, Steve does it best. I applaud you Steve for taking a stand for the ""Lawd"" (as Steve would say)and keeping it clean."
5,Awesomely funny performance!! I can relate,"I totally, totally have to disagree with SoulSista1 - ANYONE who plays an ACTIVE part in the church can relate to ANY of the people he portrays in his script. For EACH Christian he described I put a face with it so I felt this DVD totally wiped me out; I cried all the way through it. My family and friends have laughed at this so many times that I brought 2 or 3 copies just to pass around (in case I don't get one back). It's been said that laughter is the BEST medicine and believe me I will turn off or leave a performance if there is any cussing. I made a committment to Christ when I got saved many many years ago that I would not cuss and praise Him with the same tongue. In this DVD Steve proves you do not have to use those words to be funny. LAUGHTER has been a huge part of my life and Steve (in this DVD) has enriched this Christian's life. God bless you Steve!! Now that you've gotten to this point in life I hope you stay there."
4,Hilarious,"Real funny performance,especially as Steve performs without ""cussing"".I sent a copy to my family in England who enjoyed it as well."
4,Weber 41429 Rolling Cart for Weber Q and Baby Q Grills,"This worked pretty well for out Weber Q grill.The only thing that could be improved is how well the grill is latched into the stand.If you move too quickly the grill will slide out of position and could possibly fall. The grill legs just slide onto a little shelf like area to set them in. However, keeping that it mind it works well."
3,Okay,"I havent yet used it to roll my Weber Q along grassy knolls or beachfront property but as a stand for my Weber that is on my lanai it does its job.Note that when scrub cleaning the grates, I have to use a third hand to hold the cart steady as it can sway back and forth under heavy scrubbing. Of course, I can always take the grill OFF the cartstand to scrub it but that would be more work!!! Get the other stand which looks sturdier if you dont anticipate taking the grill anywhere."
2,Very unstable - dangerous!,"I'm surprised by the positive reviews for this product. I'm only giving it two stars instead of one because it is pretty much as described, an inexpensive and flimsy stand. The dangerous part is that when the Weber Q is placed on it, it is very top heavy. When the Weber lid is open, it only takes a few ounces of pressure to tip it over backward.They have ""clips"" to hold the Q in place, but they don't hold and if you lift up the Q at all, it will pop out. I am not going to return it, because it is pretty much what you pay for, but I won't use it either, as it is too dangerous, especially around children. I'd consider the much larger ""stationary"" cart (which strangely enough also has wheels) but it seems to have its own drawbacks. I'm going to stick with a heavy metal table.I would strongly recommend against buying this stand."
2,Over-tightening detaches threaded head,"I bought this product looking for a COAX cable which did not require me to permanently damage my thumbs or break out a wrench to attach and detach. These do fulfill that requirement. The springs added as strain relief don't appear to do much, but do produce some minutes of enjoyment by fiddling with them.On the not-so-great: this cable is only double shielded, while quad shielded cables can be found at a similar price. I bought them anyway for the connectors.The connectors, however, are not as strong as I would have hoped. Merely hand tightening one of the ends deformed the crimping that attaches the movable, threaded, portion of the connector to the rest (which is attached to the cable). The threaded portion popped off, and no longer stays on, meaning I have a cable with 1 end that won't attach to anything."
5,A different kind of calculus book,"It's a lovely book. What's especially nice about it is how it places calculus firmly in the world, first by embedding it in history and second by showing that its purpose is to solve interesting problems, physical and otherwise. That's different from, and much better than, ordinary calculus books, with their handed-down-from-Sinai exposition and phony ""applications"". A student who gets through the book will have a liberal education in mathematics, physics, and economics."
1,No Widescreen?! What a joke!,"Like many formerly rabid Lucas fans, I really wanted to like Episodes I and II. However, I finally came to the bitter realization that George Lucas was not a god, and that maybe ""Howard the Duck"" wasn't as much of an aberration as we originally thought.Now, both episodes are being offered on DVD in pan and scan ONLY?!?! I don't think I'm being cynical to think that this is so that die-hards will buy the pan/scan versions NOW, then spend MORE money buying the widescreen editions later. (then to be followed even later by the ULTIMATE edition - with bonus Jar Jar scenes that originally hit the ""cutting room floor"") <sigh>Gheez, doesn't ILM make enough money to support itself without GL having to resort to consumer abuse?Would it be SO HARD to offer a chopped-up version and a widescreen version at the same time?!?!"
5,AWSOME MOVIES FOR AN AWSOME PRICE!,I actualy prefer full screen and both of these moves are state of the art. A great addtition to my collection.
5,Different and challenging,This is a killer on butt and legs and pretty amazing all-around workout. I started going back to some yoga and and started Pilates to improve my flexibility and strengthen my lower back which also helped to compliment this program. I liked trying something different and will keep it in my workout mix.
4,Good instruction but short in length,"In my novice opinion this is a good, all Capoeira workout- I've recently been introduced to Capoeira and love the fun, challenging workouts that are part of this beautiful martial art. This video is a good way to practice what you learn in class - especially for a beginner who is still learning to combine movements. The workouts are short, but challenging."
5,Good ride in North Carolina,"My daughter loves this car. She got it for her first birthday and was THE hit of the day. She loves to ride in it or just sit and watch other kids.The first one we got had molding problems with the axle assembly, but Little Tikes shipped another and no problem with it. I have two complaints from the ""parent"" side. It definitely needs a seat belt (the customer service rep at Little Tikes told us it had one) and also the handle for pushing it needs to be better mounted. The screw that holds it in the back of the car has already come out and we have replaced with a larger one. This is still not going to last long term. Get with it Little Tikes you make a great product, it just needs some refining and you know it. I agree with other reviewers that rubber tires would be nice as well.Other than that...she is the envy of every child in the neighborhood."
3,No Door???,"My 3 year old son LOVES this toy, but I can not believe that it was not designed with a door that opens and closes. It was difficult for my son to get in and out up until about 3 months ago."
3,Would be great with a seat belt,"My son is 9 months old...he loves driving, shifting, and putting his cell phone in the little slot on the side. The handle is great so we can push him but it really needs that seat belt. Right now he keeps sliding forward and getting stuck under the steering wheel when we put him in it. He gets very disgruntled over that and is done playing immediately. I figure when he's a little older (my niece is 24 months and loves hers) that it will be great for going to the mall.As was stated before, if you don't read the directions the wheels will almost definately be backwards (both my son and niece have this with front wheels on wrong).We got ours on sale for $20 and for that price I would give it 4.5 stars, for $60 I'd give it the three I have here."
5,almost a year later and we still love it!,"We love this little car. We have had it for almost year and my daughter(now almost 2)still wants to get it out anytime we are in the yard! The other reviews speak of how loud the wheels are and this is true, BUT we live in the country and on grass it works GREAT! I went through 2 strollers before I found this car and I cant think of another toy Emma has that has been used as much as this car!"
3,"lots of fun, but difficult to put together","I bought this for my 18 month old and there are good and bad things about this toy. The good is that she absolutely loves it. We couldn't get her out of it. The bad is that after taking 2 hours to put together (one of the tires didn't have the hold completely drilled out, which gives you an idea of the quality) , one trip around the block and through our living room, and the wheel fell off. Since you cannot take the tire off once it is on, and you can't hammer the wheel on with the tire, we were out of luck. Then this sticky white glue like substance came out all over us. It went back to Toys R Us. My advise, if you buy in the Toys R Us store, pay the extra money and have someone else put it together for you. That is what I did."
5,Little Tikes Deluxe Cozy Convertible Car,My son loves going out in this car!! Everytime we go outside he wants to ride in it. It converts into something he can push himself later as well. I'm so..happy I purchased this!!
4,"great product, difficult instructions","this has been a great investment. my husband and i ran into toys r us w/our daughter (9 mo at the time). when we tried her in the floor model, she had a ball! we had to get one. they only had one in stock, which was in a damaged box. so, we decided to wait. glad we did. we saved by ordering through amazon. and, the super saver shipping took only 4 days. anyway, my husband spent THREE hours trying to put it together. now, granted he was a bit tired before he started the project. so, i'm curious if others had as much trouble. in the end, he had to make some modification to get the wheels to function correctly.great to have. just wish it had a seatbelt for my climber! we really have to watch her right now. i would recommend it to anyone who's looking for something like this."
4,You Don't Have to be a Genius is Indeed Ingenious,"This book will not only help people enhance their creative skills but put them on the road to realizing their dreams and aspirations. The exercises are fun and really make one think about what they want for themselves. Just like the characters of Wendell and Max, Hoepner's book gave me the courage to take the risks and push my creativity of writing in a new direction and publish my first book. A book well worth reading."
4,complicated returns? this is your best choice,"PC version on Win XP. I only used for my personal return and this is my 3rd year with turbotax product. It is the only one that has any chance of handling more complicated returns with business income- none of the others even listed the forms I need. This year there was a glitch with form 6252- it imported data from last year but did not prompt me in the interview. I called support on tax day and had a live person within a few minutes. Later I used the chat for a follow up question.service- 5 starssoftware- 4 starsoverall value- 5 starsI completed a complex return and 2 others a little less complex in less than a day. The help window on the side and other pop-ups (on request) answered every question I had (other than software issue) I also recommend ""It's deductible"" which integrates wonderfully with turbo and pays for itself many times over."
1,Yep. TaxCut works TurbTax doesn't,"Worked an hour, not too many problems, however, got to the end and got an error, ""Form not available."" Intuit attempted to point their finger at IRS. . .TaxCut worked flawlessly including the form that Intuit said was ""unavailable.""Earlier this year after >10years w/Quicken I also switched to MS Money after Intuit excuses and lack of service. (I am very impressed with Money)Suggest avoiding TurboTax, at least for a while until Intuit manages to get their act together."
4,Women Power!,I loved this book! It reminded me how strong women can be and made me want to be as well! The book was really entertaining and uplifting. You feel like flicking off all the jerks that ever treated you bad after reading this book!
2,This is absolutely pedestrian...,"If you're looking for an admirable, intelligent, witty, and emotionally strong protagonist, put this book down immediately and run. I am a fan of ""chick books."" I LOVED ""Bridget Jones' Diary"" and even ""4 Blondes.""Granted, every women is insecure and enjoys reading about other women being insecure so that it all feels normal. But, Tracy is very unknowing and not endearing in a ""Mary Jo Buttafuco"" way. Any woman who dates a man (Will) for 6 years and allows him to treat her like a homeless man Will would walk over at the West 4th subway station, is just plain infuriating. Also, I wouldn't waste my time reading about a character who doesn't realize her boyfriend is cheating on her even after Will's friends meet Tracy and are SHOCKED that Will has a girlfriend. It goes on and on...."
2,Don't you just love whiners? (Please sense my sarcasm.),"Throughout the entire course of this novel I felt that the only thing that Tracy did was whine! She whined about her boyfriend, her weight, her job... And I never got the impression that she would ever get off her duff and do anything to fix the things she didn't like about her situation. She is not a strong character and this is not a hard book to ignore."
5,Fun from Start to Finish,"Literary snobs aside, most of us understand sitting down with a book is done for pure entertainment and no one does it better than Wendy Corsi Staub - aka Wendy Markham. SLIGHTLY SINGLE is yet another fun read from the author of the chilling FADE TO BLACK and LONG WAY HOME. This is not formulaic writing, it's funny, touching real life - I don't know why she's using a pseudonym but Corsi Staub/Markham's long and diverse list of books make it clear this woman can write. Narcissitic twenty-somethings are hardly a thing of the past - and this 30-something enjoyed living vicariously through Tracy, cigarettes and all!"
1,He don't know much about geography (or English),"He has a degree in English, but it doesn't show in this poorly written, poorly researched guide to US geography. (Can you tell by the title it's about the US?) Here's a quote (page 66, discussing Crater Lake National Park):""The lake, which has an area of 20 sq. miles, is known for its intense blue color....The lake covers 286.3 sq. miles."" And growing by the minute, no doubt. The entries are not listed alphabetically, or any other order that can be recognized. The text reads like a weather report - breezy and not intended to hold together from page to page. There must be better books than this."
3,"great Sign, poor arrival","This sign is just what I wanted to post over my toilet. Its well made and a funny sign. The only problem I had was the condition of the sign when it arrived. The sign was bent and it had to be pounded flat with a rubber mallet. This worked so I didnt bother to send it back so I have no Idea what the company would have done so I can't speak to that. All things considered I have to give this 3 stars for its condition on arrival.additional.. also the sign reads violaters will be vanquished to another realm.. its BANISHED vanquished killed or what ever,, lost in translation I bet. Still it looks great on the wall behind the toilet. LOL"
1,Very poor book,"I didn't even get to use it. This book doesn't have any content ! It is just like a homework book, the teacher has the one with the lectures and this one is the one that have the question and that is it.! You don't learn nothing from this book."
2,QC issues,"I'm on my third X1 in 3 weeks. The first two worked for a few days then became intermittent before dying. I have two ARC AAAs and two Inova X5s that I've owned for several years. They have been reliable. I avoid chinese made products when I can, but I have to wonder if the River Rock light (sold at Target) wouldn't have been a better choice."
1,JUNK!!!,I bought this light at target for $19.75. When i got home i tried to use the light. I took it out of the package and turned it on... nothing happened. Then i banged it on my hand then it came on VERY dimly. Orignaly i thought it was the battery so i replaced it. I did the same thing... NOTHING HAPPENED! I am very dissapointed with this so i will be getting a refund in a couple days.
5,"folks, use Alkaline batteries only","I note that several folks recommend lithium and other types of AA batteries. But Inova specifically specifies AA ""Alkaline"" batteries.This is important, because non-alkaline batteries may produce levels of voltage and/or current that can damage the LED bulb. Which may explain some of the negative reviews, with people complaining ""it broke."" Although the other AAs will physically fit, they apparently are electrically incompatible.I suggest if you want a flashlight that can handle lithium batteries, that you buy only a flashlight specified for lithiums.I've noted many otherwise attractive LED flashlights using AA or AAA batteries, whose manufacturers state that only alkaline batteries can be used. Buyer beware."
3,Not very bright,"This flashlight was a lot dimmer than I expected. Maybe I just assumed that all LED lights were bright, but this barely has a range of 10-15' that you can actually use to see things clearly at night, and the light doesn't spread out, it just stays in one little spot. Don't use it for finding your way in the dark, because you can't see anything outside the area of light. I'd only recommend it for things that require localized light such as fixing something or rummaging around in a glove compartment."
4,It is All about what you are Looking for,"Well If You Are Looking for Soft Porn, then this is Good one to have. The Girls are Beautiful, it is Well shot and you will find some Humor."
1,Lame,"Bought this in the black leather. It looks good by itself and it is true to size, but it just looked so chunky on my feet because of the very round toe. The black colour was not very rich and always looked very dull even after polishing it. The threading has also started to fray a bit on the band round the back. Bottom line, I have retired this shoe to the back on my cupboard in case I have to use it as a last resort option"
4,the dust does blow forward,"i just stumbled upon this very nicely designed package when i stumbled into a small music store browsing. i dont mind saying that firstly i have always been opposed to ""best of comps"". i am a vinyl collector and have a very nice beefheart collection that i am very fond of. my prise in his catalogue is a white label pressing of ""lick my decals off baby"". this has always been, in my opinion, his most rewarding release. anyway. i saw this anthology and was pleasantly taken off guard to know that his music has been collected in a such a respectful manner. since all of my beefheart is on lp, this was one compilation i completely support and it has been added to my collection. on a final note: it took an artist of beefhearts standing to make this a decision that was easy to make. thank you rhino!"
1,Not very good,"I just checked this out from the library hoping to improve my child's writing. The video gives steps and strategies on how to write an essay but gives NO EXAMPLES AT ALL! It is just energetic young people telling the camera (or you the audience) the steps and strategies. These are the correct steps and strategies, but without examples, the strategies are too abstract for a young student."
4,I feel more organized,I purchased this to organize my life a little more and what a success. Now I don't even have to get off the couch to play my x-box or watch a movie. That remote is so handy.
3,UNUSABLE SIGNAL,"GOOD PRODUCT, BUT IT WORKS BAD IN GE AND RCA TV SET,IN EVERY INTESE SCENE APPEARS A TREMOR ON THE IMAGE AND THE ""UNUSABLE SIGNAL"" NOTICE APPEARS ON THE SCREEN, IF YOU HAVE ANOTHER BRAND OF TV SET IT WORKS PRETTY GOOD."
4,Suits my needs,"I'm using this device as part of my cheap surveillance system in my living room. It's hooked up to an RCA to VGA converter and I use it to switch between two cameras. The remote is a must for this type of set up. The only shortcoming, the scan option scrolls through all four channels and cannot be programmed on just the active ones -- pretty much rendering scan useless for me....but, that's not that big of a deal."
3,"Two Really Good Movies, Two So-So...","We usually like Hugh Grant movies. He's usually funny and a little romantic. This collection was a little different. Two of the movies (Mickey Blue Eyes and Two Weeks Notice) were funny, romantic, great! The other two movies were ""strange"". One, Music and Lyrics, was rather slow, drawn-out, boring and we couldn't wait for it to end. The other, An Awfully Big Adventure was strange, hard-to-follow, kind-of-creepy, tragic and sad. This movie was rated R, the others were PG-13. We also had trouble with the design of the DVD case. It has a swinging insert holding one of the double-sided DVD's, which came loose during shipping scratching the DVD's, so that they skip and freeze. The replacement was in the same condition. We would suggest replacing the case, if you order. However, for about $10, it was still a good deal, if only for the two better movies."
3,"Nice that it's available in the US, but...","This DVD appears to be a conversion from VHS or even the original film, since there is a break in the middle with a placard announcing that reels are being changed. It has no features of a standard DVD: no menu, no chapter breaks, no subtitle options. It is subtitled in English, and while not terrible, the translation leaves much to be desired compared to Racine's beautiful poetry in the original French. Marie Bell's performance is excellent, though in my opinion, a younger Phedre would be more convincing. Other performances are also solid. The sets, costumes, and staging are fitting and have aged fairly well for the most part, though this is clearly not a ""modern"" performance. Despite the DVD's faults, it's the only version of Racine's Phedre I've found that's compatible with U.S. DVD players, and I am glad at least to have it available."
5,This is a very relaxing album,The haunting music on this album transports me to a state of total relaxation better than any music I've experienced. The repetition of Indian chant and the soothing sound of Celtic harp make a wonderful combination. This is not for pure etertainment or dinner music; it is for meditation and relaxation.
4,Great Entertainment Center!,"I just bought this computer one week and two days ago and I'm loving it! The possibilities seem endless. You can hook your TV, VCR, Camcorder, Cable Box, Digital Camera or whatever else you might want to connect. You can view your TV and record. The picture quality is good, not great on the TV. It supports the current region lock so watch out with those PAL DVDs. It can be difficult to set the TV Signal but I finally got it right. Support is good for 12 months toll free. There's quick buttons to launch the software of your choice on the front of the PC.So far, so good!April 4, 2006I'm still enjoying this wonderful system. Still no major problems that wasn't my own fault! HP is a good way to go."
4,Perfect bow tie,"Got his for my 13-year-old son. He loves it! Color is a little more burgundy than scarlet (thus the 4 stars), but it's a great tie and looks sharp."
3,This was not one of the better books by Kleypas,"This book started strongly and I was ready to really enjoy a new Kleypas novel. But, it went downhill quickly. The writing was as good as usual, but the story had almost no conflict or tension. It was basically a simple love story where two people meet and fall in love. While I'm happy for the characters, I expect a little more from such an excellent author."
3,Not her best,"I'm a great fan of Lisa Kleypas. I eagerly await her books, but although this book was okay. It didn't measure up to some of her previous books. I was a little disappointed."
2,"Major disappointment, read her other series instead!","My advice, read her other series instead. Wallflowers is great, so is Hathaways (save for book 4). As for this series, sorry but as someone who enjoyed Kleypas till now I say, unfortunately, skip the entire series."
4,"Great for early readers, just be sure to read all reviews.","This book series has been great for my son's early reading. He fell in love with the antics of Fox and his friends. The stories have good morals, but be sure to read the reviews. There is at least one book that shows Fox smoking (though he gets sick) which might not be what you want.Fox at School is one of the good ones of this series."
2,don't waste your money on the cleanser,The beautly blender is great for flawless and easy application of make up. The cleanser bottle does not dispense cleanser and you cannot open the bottle to acess the fluid. Buy the single packets of cleanser or use a gentle face wash or baby shampoo to clean the beauty blender.
2,Andre Love Songs,DVD sound track faulty. Loud crackling sounds causes annoyance and not possible to enjoy. No reply from Amazon to complaints after receiving a replacement copy which was also faulty.
5,a lovely Collection,"This Program has a variety of Rieus Songs, that from other dvds are on. It takes some of the most beautiful and romantic Songs of him and puts them on to one convenient dvd. Everyone who is a fan should buy."
2,Not quite good,"The sound is stereo, with some audible distortions in the mid range.The image is neither 4:3 nor 16:9, so it appears surrounded by black bars on my widescreen TV!"
4,Smooth Sounds,".I like the sounds of violin, especially when supported by a good orchestra. In this CD, Andre Rieu performs several popular songs. The songs include: Romeo and Juliet, Chanson D'Amour, Romance Anonyme, and Morning From Peer Gynt.My only question is why my wife does not like this CD. I don't think it is the music, as she likes these song on other CDs by different artists. If anyone can suggest why she would believe it just ""grates"" against her, please let me know because I like this music.The quality of the CD is excellent and the orchestration sound. These musicians play the songs artistically. I enjoyed the music and recommend this CD.."
2,"Shadows, a shadow warrior's nemesis","I rarely give up on a game but here I am, half way through and throwing it in because Team Ghost Recon fights all their battles at dusk in urban environments covered in shadows. I guess I'm spoiled for newer games where your character's eye adjust to the light."
4,Ghost Recon 2,"The game arrived promptly, no hassle. Ghost Recon 2 has a great single player, though I didn't like the multiplayer that much compared to other PS3 shooters."
4,Remains the Best Book on Providing Quality Customer Service,I've used this information for almost 10 yrs. in training staff involved with providing public service. It remains one of the easiest and most illuminating products for staff development on the market today. Always useful and continues to represent the better qualities needed for providing excellent customer service.
3,Better than having to look up items on your own,"I bought this after reading about it in USA Today. While it isn't all I hoped for, it was very helpful in organizing and valuing most of our many donations for the year. You have to buy an upgrade to value electronics though, which is a pain. Also, the installation is only good for one tax year. Since I picked 2003, it says I need to buy another copy for 2004 (not so much of an issue for 2004 buyers...). It did export nicely to my turbotax.Oh, one more thing - you can track medical expenses and miscellaneous expenses in it, but you can't export them to turbotax. Its up to the user whether they want to waste their time doing that, but I did not realize that at first."
1,Dont' Waste Your Time & Money,"I have two serious issues with ItsDedubitle. First, I have not been able to get the software to load properly. The download version was purchased and didn't work. Tried to re-download from Intuit and had the same install issue (cannot find database).Second issue is lack of timely and competent support. The chat support took 48 minutes for a representative to arrive. After answering a number of questions, the rep simply said they didn't know the answer. ""Have a nice day. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?"", then an abrupt message saying I was disconnected from the Intuit support server.The reason the product was purchased was to save time; I've already took more time than doing the form by hand. Save your self anguish, time and money. I threw away $20; wish I had contributed it to a worthy cause to deduct on my taxes!"
1,It's Deductible Problem,"This was an excellent program at one time. This program now has a serious glitch in version 7 which renders the progam inoperable for non-cash donations, usually the most common ones made. It is missing a file ""WSNonCash.pdf"". I found this on two disks each from a different source, one directly from Intuit and the other purchased from a retail outlet. I would not purchase this product until there is some announcement that the problem has been fixed. Intuit is supposed to send me a new disk which I just discovered is on backorder. Maybe this means they are fixing the program."
3,Misleading photo,"The picture clearly shows a Toyota/Denso throttle position sensor, but the sensor received is a generic item with only a ""made in Taiwan"" sticker. I am disappointed, since I never buy generic parts... only OEM or Toyota."
1,dairy of anymphomaniac,"film was warped about half way thru the video was then useless to me,i did no.t remember it after that"
4,good,I loved the main character very beautiful. Which is what I want to see when I am watching an adult movie
2,Not the quality I expect from Little Tikes,"My kids (1.5 & 3) got this for Christmas and it's going back. Like others have said, the net doesn't stay in place. The way it loops through the hoop to secure is pretty crummy and the loops loosen and fall out as the ball goes through the hoop. My other big complaint is that the adjustable post doesn't lock in position. The yellow plastic piece that is supposed to lock the adjustable post into place won't attach to the stationary post. At this point we don't need to raise the hoop but when we are ready to raise it that option is totally off the table the way the unit is now."
1,Fell apart after 1 summer season!!!!!,My mother bought this for my son for a Birthday Present in May. We put it up for him to play with in June- by August the hoop would not stay up anymore. It was like the sun had made the plastic too hot and now the hoop is too heavy for the base to keep up. It is very frustrating! I think the plastic they make these toys with these days are cheap!
3,The Finest Jazz Program Ever (missing some material),"Quality wise, this is a vast improvement over the VHS version of the Sound of Jazz -- which looked like it was recorded underwater. As the above reviewer states, there is no performance by Thelonious Monk -- though he did appear in this program and his group is listed in the end credits. The packaging has no notes inside of any kind and, inexplicably, has a photo of Charlie Parker on the back -- who never appeared in this program. So, a mixed bag, but --until someone issues a better version -- it is worth having."
1,sound of jazz,"This is a disgraceful reissue. The best tv show featuring jazz ever is hacked up and cut down without any acknowledgement. Thelonious Monk doesn't appear, except in the credits. I can't imagine why this was done, but it should be taken off the market."
5,HC needs another album,"As soon as I bought the Hot Jazz CD, I went looking for Tall Tales. Too bad I found it in the pop section rather than the country or near bluegrass where it belongs. I am totally impressed with this group and play these two disks more than the other 70 or so artists I have, combined. The female singer has an awesome 40's type voice and in a way reminds me of Mandy Barnett. The instrumentals are extremely well done, though I wish they had left ""Polka dot and Moonbeams"" on Tall Tales a complete instrumental. If you are looking for a western swing album, but don't mind a jazz blend, this is the group for you. They need to get their next album out soon!"
4,music for the happy side of your soul,"I dunno, like the music a lot, but then i almost like every swing-revivel cd out there. This is the first review i write, i'm writing it because i feel i have to explain why i gave this wonderful cd ""only"" four stars. Well, thats because i discoverd ""andrew bird's bowl of fire"" before i've discovered ""hot town"". Their album, ""trills' is kind of above all ratings so i cannot get myself to rating this album as high as theirs. If you like this album, you're gonna adore ""thrills""."
5,This game is so much fun!,"This game is so much fun! You learn things about people that you never knew... heck, you learn things maybe *they* didn't even know. My friend introduced me to it and ever since then, I've ""Cubed"" everyone I know. It's lots of fun to do with new friends as well."
5,The Baby Blue Cat and the Whole Batch of Cookies,"This was a beautiful book by Ainslie Pryor. The soft illustrations, a little bit of humor, and a wonderfully kind mother cat made it a book that my son and I loved together when he was little. I wanted to buy this as a gift for my new nephew and was very disappointed to find that it's out of print."
3,Useful for folks who need to move from ERM to XML based modeling,This is a useful book for analysts and programmers who are coming from an Entity Relationship Modeling background - and who need to understand the theory and mechanics of developing XML Schemas for applications.
2,Just another useless modeling idea,"The book is poorly organized. If one does not know the context of the topic ahead, it would be very hard to follow. The book did not even mention where to download, how to use its companion modeling tool. The reader has to figure that out.There are a lot of theoretical sections that I don't see necessity to be empasized or even presented.The author conveyed the idea of AOM (Asset Oriented Modeling), but I am still clueless about the value of this AOM modeling. I am not convinced to adopt this modeling methodology to solve a real world problem. To me, it is just another proprietary practice of modeling, with no or very little pratical value. The material is very difficult to be tied to technical implementation, thus it is only good on paper.I don't understand why there are so many good comments about this book. But after going through the book briefly, I realized it is a waste of time and money."
1,The Paris Pilgrims,"This book is ridiculous. Carlile puts words in the mouths of characters under many sets of circumstances which he could know nothing about--intimate dialogue that is absurd when created in this manner. I realize it is billed as a novel, however, I thought there would be more depth of character shown here. This book is shallow and disappointing. Carlile takes factual circumstances and builds private conversations around them. The scene where he has Hemingway having intercourse with McAlmon--am I naive? I have read a lot of Hemingway--did I miss something? I never got a hint of this type of relationship. And the way he sets the event up is absurd--like a dream sequence. It is idiotic. However, if there were no mention of the sexual escapades of the group, it would have been too boring to continue. I was glad when I finished this. I didn't find it to be well written."
3,It just wasn't THAT bad!,"I am surprised by the almost across the board dislike of this book. Yes, Carlile paints unflattering portraits of Hemingway and many of the expats and his descriptions can be extremely vulgar. (If you're offended, or even made uncomfortable by homosexuality, then this is definitely not the book for you). The writing isn't scintillating but I've read far worse lately from far more celebrated authors. I found the story of the Hemingway's 20-month stay in Paris very interesting. Not being a big fan of Hemingway's, the book certainly did nothing to tarnish his image for me. I loved the fact that James Joyce's wife thought her husband wrote absolute nonsensical drivel. Despite his place at the top of the lists of 20th century authors, there are a lot of people who agree with her. Carlile certainly seems to make the expatriate society seem more like Peyton Place than a golden era of intellectualism - but maybe in hindsight it was."
4,Paris Pilgrims,"I could not put this book down. I think it perfectly reflects the time period and Hemingway's true personality. ""Paris Pilgrims"" is a great companion book to ""A Moveable Feast."""
3,Super Man... Maybe I've gotten too old!!,Maybe I've gotten too old or this country is such a mess that I don't believe anyone can save us like I use to.
5,Incredible historical account!,This is one of the best books ever published on the history of the 5th Air Force in the early days of WWII in the Pacific. An absolute MUST READ for any historian . . .
2,Hydaulic cylinder leaks - disappointed,"I received the product and assembled it. Used it once straight away to put an engine on a stand. The second time I tried to use it there was a puddle of oil on the floor, and it wouldn't hoist past the 1/2 way point. It seems to have a 1 year guarantee, but I can't find an amazon contact on this page. The product is only 4 months old and has only been used once."
1,Buyer Beware,"While the Skylink G6VR seemed like a great and affordable replacement for my remote as it was cheaper than just buying a replacement remote and receiver I soon found out that sometimes you get what you pay for.This product is cheaply produced, buggy in it's operation, unreliable and is just an all around bad product. It only works 10% of the time, and when it does work it would open and close the door with a single push of the remote not allowing enough time to get into the garage. After 2 days of only working maybe 10% of the time it stopped working all together. Thinking I had just received a bad unit I ordered a replacement and the replacement was just as bad.For all prospective buyers please read the reviews and avoid this product."
4,GREAT SHOW - HOWEVER...,"No one does a biography like A&E, and this 100 minute program is the best on Ms. Minnelli so far. However, please know that the above description is incorrect as there is NO interview footage with Beyonce Knowles, Martin Scorsese, Robert DeNiro OR Goldie Hawn. However, there is some new footage in this updated version of the 2004 biography, including comments from Mary J. Blige and Alan Cummings, news footage of Liza's wedding to David Gest and one very short (maybe 5 seconds) clip of Liza commenting on Gest. While it doesn't include as much as promised in the description, Liza purists may want to replace their 2004 version with this newer, updated one."
1,Sucks bigtime!,"This movie is a TOTAL JOKE! You would think by looking at the poster that it's action-packed and stunning like ""underworld"" or ""Resident Evil"". NOT!! The actors were super slow with the fighting scenes (like they're practicing)and the dialogues were stupid. Waste of talent for Ben Kingsley (who is always good as we all know). You can't tell if the setting is in England or the US because the actors can't decide with their accents. Waste of money and time.."
1,So lame it's almost funny,"It's unforntunate that I wasted so much energy anticipating this turkey. If you happen to be a fan of B movies, then you'll probably actually enjoy it. Thin plot, lame dialogue, and special effects they must have stolen from Monty Python (cue the spraying blood and flying body parts!). If; however, you're a fan of good fantasy films don't waste your time or money!I've recently found out that they're making a sequel! Who are they kidding!!! The first one barely paid for itself!"
2,I really dont know what to say,"I just got this off a shelf because I saw the header ""Game included"" (as Im a avid gamer/game collector) and though 20 bucks for a movie and a game is a good deal.Now for the movie itself. Just to take a look at the hot T3 gal Kristana ""terminating"" vampires and humans with more than her sword made it actually worth the time spent watching the movie. The effects were very lame, the fake limbs, blood, blood squirts were mostly unrealistic and didnt come close to look real.Fights might have gotten a lot more choreography done, some of them actually look like they are done impromptu.The plot is completely lame also, hope the video game is not like the movie."
1,Whoops,"I am a huge of ""bad"" movies...but this movie is far too bad for even the likes of me! Being a fan of the games series (and having hard time finding a theatre that was actually showing ""Bloodrayne"", I was excited to finally see the movie when the DVD was released. And after the first five minutes...it was obvious that this movie was going to be deadly. Ms. Loken is a fine actress but the story, along with the costumes, the others actors, and the direction was terrible. Michael Madsen was absolutely 100% DOA and Ms. Rodriguez was also hamming it up. Pass this movie up folks."
1,The Worst Movie of 2006 Thus Far,"Director Uwe Boll has a unique specialty. He takes popular video games and makes them into horrible movies. His most recent flick was Alone in the Dark starring Christian Slater and Tara Reid that had a brief theater run before being rushed out on video. Since Boll is planning on producing movies based on popular video games such as Dungeon Siege, Far Cry, and Hunter: The Reckoning. In order to make these movies in time to cash in on their popularity, Boll is doing rush jobs in producing these motion pictures.Now, Boll is out with a vampire flick called BloodRayne based on a video game of the same name. This flick boasts Ben Kingsley in its cast, but the level of acting in this movie is uniformly bad. The script is cliched and just plain awful. This is the single worst movie of 2006 thus far."
1,The game has a better story.... this is definately a B movie,"Billy Zane. Since Titanic, he's become the headliner for many B movies. Though I thought I'd still give the movie a shot.Poorly written, it hardly reflects the game. The movie has none of the stunts or weapons Bloodrayne gets in the game... but from seeing the movie, I'd guess their budget to be about $1000, and they probably couldn't afford the special effects to make it possible.Poor acting, poor storyline and poor special effects make this a definate B movie.Theres even a funny part at the end where Rayne is 'recalling' her adventure through the movie and shows her slicing her former circus master's stomach with blood spewing out... and you see the white CO2 compressed air too...So, if you're a fan of the game, you'll probably be disappointed in the lack of storyline.D-"
1,"WHY,WHY ,WHY,WHY!!!!!!!","Uwe boll you stink why do you keep massecreing our eyes with your films and even worse your pressence. You have no talent what so ever and you should be banned to do any films in the future. Thank god They pulled you out of doing FEAR EFFECT and put some one better than you. And to anyone who like his films shame,shame,SHAME ON YOU!!! Message to all studios STOP FUNDING HIM!!! I know i'm shouting alot but you can understand my anger. But seriously to all studios your losing money by giving it to him and he's most likely laughing at you. If anyone agrees with me please press the yes helpful button so I know I am not alone with this problem."
1,stupid!,"this movie was a waste of money!! completely stupid, cheap and not worth your time or your money ... or your intelligence!"
1,Uwe Boll......,"Seriously just needs to give up. He's made the 3 worst movies i've ever seen. Everything about this movie is a disappointment. The best actor in the whole movie, Billy Zane, is hardly in it at all, and all the other actors were either terrible, or just obviously didn't care about the film at all. The action sequences were horribly performed, the blood & gore was laughable, and the ending sequence of the movie made absolutely no sense at all. I'm glad I didn't pay anything to see this, it's not worth paying for the rental. Horribly disappointing........."
1,awful,"I have never played a Bloodrayne game. One of my exes was a big Bloodrayne fan, loved the games, so I knew the basic premise of BR but nothing more. So I watched this movie with no preconceived notions, I wasn't going to be constantly mentally comparing the similarities and differences in the game and the movie.But the movie was awful on its own, whether it was close to the games or not. The acting is stupid, the story is horrible (if a vampire can't touch water, how do they stay clean, and by this logic, wouldn't any kind of moisture kill them?) and it's never explained how Rayne was forced to become part of the circus. Her acting especially, was shallow and lame. I didn't feel as if she was putting ANY effort into her role as Rayne.Everything was a train wreck from the start. The acting is laughable, the plot is contrived, the characters shallow, and the whole thing one huge disaster that should never have been green-lighted."
2,Could of been better.,"This movie drag on for what seemed liked days... Not much of a story, nor was there a climatic scene. I've never heard of the director before. Is he new? I did like the idea of the blades being old fashion though.Joss Whedon should of made Bloodrayne. Look at what he was able to accomplish on a television budget for Buffy and Angel. The Angel episodes especially seemed to be higher in visual quality than this movie.If you do buy this, just get it for the game."
1,Multistate really means only 1!,"We were pleased to order the Multistate Turbo Tax State 45 Multistate 2003 until we read the fine print on the box when it arrived. Our purchase price only buys the information for ONE state, additional states require additional payments! Now, I realize most people only need the tax information for a single state, but our college student managed to earn money in three different states this year-and we live in a 4th state!"
2,Defects in this software,"I had used Turbo Tax for several years but surely there is a better program available. The program with the State download ""free"" had glitches in it and would not setup. Contacting Customer Service was a difficult ordeal to acquire a replacement per instructions within the software. After waiting a very long time on the phone to talk to someone they argued that I buy it even though it came with my program as a ""free download"" and then even the replacement download was difficult to setup and expired after 8 hrs. Customer Service does not want to hear they have defects in their software even after a very long wait on the phone to talk to them. I cannot recommend Turbo Tax Software and will try something different next year."
1,New York Commuter / New Jersey Resident Still Wrong,"ATTENTION INTUIT: A BAD free state download is worse than no state download.Unfortunately, this year's version still does not know how to back out taxes paid to NY State (where I work) and apply them to New Jersey (where I live).Will you guys just fix this already?!?!?!!!!!"
1,correcting information in state tax form not possible,"I did my federal tax with turbotax delux and my state tax also with turbotax.I made some errors entering information. The federal form allowed me to make corrections after I was done.However, the state interview denies me access. Maybe I need to start all over or do it by hand.The State program is grap. I send an email to the company but did not get any reply."
5,Turbo Tax,"Have been using Turbo Tax for close to 20 years, used Parsons Tax Edge first. The product has always worked well for me and it sure beats the old fashion paper and pencil method."
1,total bs...puts women back about 50 years,"working in a high stress casino postion I have seen women with better educations and job reviews earn LESS than men..because of the mind set of *men need it more* , tell that to single moms busting their butts working 40-60 hours a week doing a better job than many of their male counterparts yet earning less. Todays women do not have *trophy* degrees as this author seems to suggest nor does the fact of being male give them any entitlement as he also suggests to a higher salary.This book is a slap in the face to all women working toward a better life and taking pride in the fact they are not lazy little princesses waiting for the knight to come take care of them.The most sexist book I have seen in a long time."
4,Does what it's supposed to do,"I have 4 devices, a wii, dvd player, tivo, and playstation 2, hooked up to this all through the composite plugs. I do not notice any signal loss to my tv. I have an older tv that has only one set of composite inputs and this works great for it."
1,Buzzes,I could just hear the audio above the buzzing sound when I plugged this product in. This device was sent back immediately.
1,Cannot open mixer,I bought this mixer because I thought it would be a cheaper version of a typical metal can mixer and it is!!!!!!!! After every mixed drink the can gets stuck! DO NOT BUY!
1,This does not work.,"I purchased this product for a drug test. I stopped using one week prior to taking this pill, i followed instructions as indicated, took on empty stomach, drank plenty of water, several hours later I was still testing positive. This item does not work as advertised."
1,liberals,"When will these liberals ever learn? Instead of actually getting out there and doing something, they just sit back and take shots at Republicans all day. While the Republicans are just trying to do what they feel is right, the Democrats give them as much hell as possible. Did you see that happening when Clinton was the president? Of course not."
5,Pleased customer,"Love it! Meets all expectations and has brought much enjoyment to myself and others. User friendly, small and compatible, can easily transport if wanting to take with on vacation. Great investment!"
3,the basics,Its a good book but not very in depth. I needed a better wiring diagram. Even though i bought this book and will use it I will be looking for more detailed information on my VW T4 van.
4,An excellent and coherent summary of broadband technologies.,"An excellent summary of the several broadband technologies that are currently searching for a marketplace. This book is notable for it's strong sense of organization and it's consistent level of detail. If you're interested in broadband network technology this book is a good stepping off point for something more technical. If you're trying to learn enough to make a buck by betting on a winning technology, this book will give you the basic understanding of broadband networks that you will need to decipher the steady stream of press releases that are coming from the companies that are betting millions on the broadband marketplace. I liked the book."
5,an excellent and approachable book - a very unique book,"George's writing style is excellent. He merges concepts from broadcast, telephony, data, and video with ease. Although the topic can be quite technical, George's focus is on the basic engineering challenges to solved. Business types will love his economic and market analysis."
1,Knock off brand sent instead,"Instead of receiving the Hoover brand vacuum cleaner bags that I ordered, I received EnviroCare Technologies (knock off) Hoover vacuum cleaner bags. These bags do not have the same allergy filtration as the actual Hoover bags. The picture online is of Hoover vacuum cleaner bags although they sent a knock off brand.I did call Amazon regarding this and they refunded my money. From other customer reviews that I have read, many customers are receiving knock off brands. So if this happens to you, please call Amazon so eventually this will stop."
2,They're Alright.,"I'll start off this critique by saying I looked like a gym prostitute that had fishnet gloves.The gloves are mesh on the back as detailed on the amazon page and it does provide ample air flow. However, between the mesh and the leather, there is this spandex material that actually has the finger space stretch. This caused the glove to be overly loose on me. I had bought these gloves thinking they fit small, so again it looked like I was trying to fit my chicken tender fingers into a gaping hole. Also, (for me at least and I know people have different sized hands)the leather was short on the finger end. It did not protect even my second joint and above, so I ended up developing calluses in the middle of my fingers.Overall, I think these gloves would better fit a Chip and Dale stripper; As these gloves do not provide ample protection."
5,Easy to learn even for beginners,"I had no experience with Fortran before getting this book(I'm an economics major and have a little experience with econometric softwares). Because this book starts with the very basic, it is not difficult to follow. Also the book offers a lot of examples to make me understand deeper. I recommend this book especially for those who haven't learned Fortran language."
3,Maybe 3.75,"Well written but not the most likable characters. The baddie was just too bad and he is in future novels in a redemptive state which i cannot buy. I myself write stuck on certain characters, so I see what is going on, but he needs to become enlightened and leave this guy behind. Good narrative flow and you are really in the story. Like the garden wall. You were totally there."
2,"Too much narrative, too little action","I really don't understand the ""I couldn't put it down"" reviews for this book. I put it down, permanently, about halfway through. It just goes on and on and on without much happening to keep the readers attention. While it has good, but not excellent, plot line, it takes forever for it to unfold and even when it does, the story plods along. This is one I was really let down by after all the sterling reviews. The only reason I even gave it a two is that it is one of the best formatted Kindle books I've read - someone took their time with this one."
4,WOW,"What a great thriller, which was available for $0.Much of the book reminded me of the Gillian Flynn books I just finished (Gone Girl).The beginning was a bit raunchy, the first 60% great, and the ending pretty good.Time to get the next in series."
5,My newest favorite!,"Every time I read another CJ West book I'm sure it's my absolute favorite. Then I think about all the others and remember why they were my favorite at the time. I guess I've never read one of his books that I don't love, and this one is amongst them."
4,Right out of Charlmagnes Tales of Chivalry,"I have loved this movie since I first saw it in the 80s. It may not be the best acted but it has great heart and spectacular visuals. Orlando, Ruggero, Bradamante, Rinaldo and the others take their inspiration from the legends of Charlmagne and his knights and create a fairy tale of a movie to enjoy. I can't wait for it to come out on DVD as my VHS copy is starting to wear out. A movie to see if you enjoyed Legend, Ladyhawke, Labyrinth and the Princess Bride"
4,A must have for the Medieval Buff,"Based loosely on the Epic Italian Poem, 'Orlando Furioso'....this 1983 Italian flick (in English), fits nicely in a collection of the other 80's medieval fantasy flicks of 'Flesh & Blood', 'Excalibur', and 'Sword & The Sorcerer' (to name a few). Great scenery, martial combat, and costumes.it's ridiculous that we can't have this on DVD already !"
2,Cheesy fun,"First off, let me say that I am a huge comic book fan. For that reason, I really DID enjoy this movie. But, it is safe to say that anybody who is not a diehard fan would definetely hate it. The origin of Captain America is different in this movie than in the comics. Also, Captain America doesn't even change into his Captain America costume until the last 15 minutes. Here are the facts: The bad guys in the movie are generic, the actors are really bad, and the movie is very low budget. BUT, it is kinda just fun seeing live action super hero stuff so if you can just relax and have a little fun, it will be enjoyable. Perhaps not long-term enjoyment, but the movie is good for at least few watches. I hope this helped."
4,The Blast is a blast,My 9 year old grandson really enjoys this boat. We live on a lake and he can run it flat out which appears to be about 15 to 20 miles per hour. The run time is about 15 minutes on a charge which is about right for his interest level. It takes about 6 to 8 hours to recharge the battery which means one run per day unless you buy a spare battery. He is ok with a single run. The first motor burned out after a few runs but the company was very helpful in troubleshooting the problem and sent me a new motor free of charge. The second motor has made 20 times the number of runs and is still running strong.
5,good stuff,"We used to stock up on this when we went down to Hilton Head every year, but the Piggly Wiggly stopped carrying it several years ago. We are not big ketchup fans, but this is the best hamburger ketchup out there."
3,"EMD GP loco book good, but lacks depth.","Here's a good basic book for any model railroader who models the 1950s and on. Rail fans who are intersted in early GP locos will be somewhat disappointed at the incomplete coverage. The GP series of locos by EMD were the most widely sold locomotives in history and hundreds are still running on short lines and regional railroads. There are lots of pictures, but more of the original locos and fewer of a few current ones would have been nice. In fact, that is the major problem with this book -- far too many pictures and too much copy are devoted to a few GPs still running on 2 or 3 short lines, mostly in the Northeast. More extensive coverage is needed of the locos as they were used when new in the 1950s and early 60s."
1,Hamel and the discovery of Korea,"Actually it's pretty simple, the book is outdated, the information too old, and there are many better books or websites available, just make a search for Hamel and Korea and you will find better ones than this book"
5,Great shocks,"Put these on my Avalanche 1500 last week and it took me less than 1 hour to do both. That includes the cleanup after.Replacing them was easy. With a little work and some cleanup after, I saved a lot of money.I am 65 years young and if I can do it, most anyone can.After I got done, I took my wife on a 160 mile round trip just to see how the ride felt. The ride is back to what it felt like when we bought the unit 7 years ago, smooooooooth!I would definitely recommend these to any of my friends"
4,Faces featuring Rod Stewart,"The only reason this doesn't get 5 stars is because I share the same feelings that the band had toward Rod. At this same time he had awesome SOLO albums coming out. Can you imagine the Faces with Rods full creative attention? Oh well, whatever, its still great stuff lots of fun and I can still remember the concerts. Faces were the ultimate live band that would party along with you. Those of you that were fortunate enough to see them live will really appreciate this."
4,Good old sloppy rock n roll.,"Faces is a straight-up raunchy rock band. Good stuff, the recordings aren't great but this is still a great rock n roll album. Rod's voice is best over a loose blues-style band playing songs about fights and drinking mixed with a couple ballads of relatively good quality. This is the kind of rowdy band that would never see the light of day today, so get em were you can!"
4,"A great compilation, but","if you're a fan of the old albums, get them (Long Player, Oh La La, Gasoline Alley, A Nod is as Good as a Wink). You'll miss the left off songs a lot after listening to this collection."
5,Worked Great For Me!,I bought these on a whim from a local drugstore. I thought they worked great. I followed the directions exactly and used them over my whole face. I am in my 40's and am getting that peach fuzz on my face. This worked great!
1,NEVER again!,"I've never used a home waxing product before, but they can't get any worse than this. My skin is extremely tolerant (I work in skin care and am exposed to plain chemicals and products on a daily basis), but even with my hardy epidermis, I got a painful bumpy rash as soon as I pulled off the strip. It also only removed about half of the hair.I tried this product and Nair cream on the same day. Both gave me a painful and ugly reaction, though I've never experienced adverse effects with any other product. Save your skin and your wallet the trouble."
3,Marin Chewables,the product came all damaged-poor packaging and our dog would not eat the tablets like the ones we bought from another place. Maybe not as fresh.
2,Not a very good example,I was disappointed in this book due mainly to the fact that the siblings and friends treated each other so poorly. This is bad enough but there is never any talk of the parents intervening and teaching the children how to treat each other with kindness and respect. Children do not need to be encouraged to treat each other in mean spirited ways. I would not recommend this book to anyone.
4,Good Characterization & Character Dynamics,"I like science fiction that has both good characterization and believable science; Ms. Downing (who also wrote under the name of Paula King) is very talented at character development and her science seems pretty solid (I'm not a physics expert though).Ingram's editorial review omits the fact that the book isn't just about Jason Roarke, but also about how young Magda copes with senseless tragedy. Both characters grow up a little in this story, and it's very enjoyable suspense. The other characters in the book are pretty realistic, too -- not stereotypes, so you get some exposure to group dynamics, too.My two favorites of Ms. Downing's are ""A Whisper of Time"" and ""Fallway""."
1,too easy and unrealistic,"The exams in this book are too easy, unrealistic and they are very much alike. Besides, the questions don't cover a wide range of topics. A waste of time and money!"
4,Warm feelings,"This is a fantastic book that you can pick up and in a few minutes have a nice, warm, happy feeling. The stories are well written and personal. It reminds us of the romance we all have inside but sometimes don't allow ourselves to show."
3,"Good, but....","If you are looking for something that is lint free you may want to try something else. These pads right out of the package left some lint behind on some boots I was treating. It wasn't that big of a deal, maybe it would be better to wash them before using."
5,Perfect for Touching Up.,"These pads have been perfect for touching up my car interior. I tend to use leather protector, vinyl protectors, cleaners and etc. to self detail my car. These pads are more effective and efficient than paper towels, plus they are re-washable."
1,Dissapointed,"Thought I had found a bargain for waterproof, desert boots but had in fact found some very subpar materials and a very cheaply constructed boot. Remember....you do get what you pay for. I sent the boots back at my expense; no return shipping was covered by the company."
3,Ok read,"This book was OK, but I often felt confused by the characters. Jace was always so hot and cold. When the book was finished, I wondered where the rest of the book was. I felt like the intimacy was missing...sure a few flirty episodes, but not much real romance. An OK read to let your mind wander for a few hours."
5,So much more than I imagined,I only remembered Man of la Mancha from the hazy VHS days when I was little girl. Watching this dvd was a great experience because there is so much more in the movie than I remembered or imagined. It's a great story based on reality. It's a classic and a great pre-cursor to reading Cervantes.
4,Maltin's review is off base,"Granted, a VHS version is not a Broadway experience and Peter O'Toole's voice falls short of Richard Kiley's, but this movie is far from ""plodding"" and ""abysmal"". First, Sophia Loren is exquisite as Dulcinea. Secondly, the power of the play itself overwhelms any weaknesses of the small screen or the individual performers. This version is an approachable production which allows the general public to experience the magic of Quixote. It is a theatrical experience well worth the time and expense."
3,Misses the stage show's depth and intensity,"The stage musical was a vibrant, confrontational, brutal, fairly experimental piece of theatre when it first debuted in the middle of the turbulent 1960s, its consciously ambiguous message acknowledging the brutality of the world but suggesting that by living a courageous, engaged, aggressive life, we can stand up to the darkness we encounter. In its original incarnation, ""The Impossible Dream"" (its real title is ""The Quest"") is a subtly drawn, carefully shaded anthem about living life out loud, about fighting hard even though we can never win -- NOT about being a mindless optimist, as many people present it today. Though the source material is excellent, this film version falls into the trap people still fall into today with this show, treating it as cute, as optimistic, instead of as a call to arms against the violence and hypocrisy we will never fully defeat."
1,FAKE,This is not the real deal....trust me it is FAKE ...made in Bance instead of france and it is not the same product...dont buy this
5,A basic for any vocalist's collection,"Nicolette Larson was one of my favorites in the late 70's-80's and remains a clear recognizable voice on this CD. Extremely well thought out liner notes, obviously created with love for this woman whos passing makes this all the more bittersweet. This is a wonderful collection! As a vocalist, I LOVE some of these songs and play them again and again. I didn't get a chance to see her perform live, but this collection does give you the ""feel"" of her work."
3,Good product but it came craked,"Its a nice hous, I used for a little squirrel. I put 3 stars on this because it cames cracked. The window hole is to close to the door hole so it is some king of week on this part."
5,The Best Bar None,"Lets put to this to rest once and for all, there are only two Marx. Bros. documentaries to even consider when debating which is the ""best"", one is the ""Unknown Marx Bros."" and the other is the ""Marx Bros. In A Nutshell"". Any Marx Bros. fan would enjoy either one but as far as which is superior there is absolutely no contest,""In A Nutshell"" is not only the better documentary but one of the best showbiz documentaries ever produced. Yes there is a $20 price difference between these two tiltles and while I can't justify or condone why a 20 year old documentary carries such a hefty price as ""Nutshell"" lets just leave it to the old adage that you get what you pay for. Nuff said."
3,cautions!,"The following is from a message I sent to someone. My relatively low rating is based on the fact that Intuit couldn't be bothered to point these two things out. This is using OS 10.3.2.I too discovered that I had to scroll all the way down the license window before the 'accept' button became active. I wasted many hours finding this out. It wasn't my intelligence---pure desperation! I also have never seen this before. I can't begin to tell you all the useless things I have been doing all day!!One interesting point I noted. When I finally did do the install and started up the program, it wouldn't work. It claimed that there were missing fonts. It turns out that the five fonts installed by TurboTax were installed with the default setting of 'off.' Once I activated them in FontBook, everything was OK."
5,Squall Leonart,I got this as a gift from one of my friends on my birthay. This figure is amazing it has tons of articulation and great poseabillity. the gun blade is crafted down to the last detail and the figure its self is a perfect replica of squall.This figure is a must buy for any final fantasy fan
3,Very Simple game good for 4 and under,This is a cute game. This version and graphics are old but still work good. The bad thing about it was my 5 year old finished this game in 20 minutes. I would recommend this for children under 4 and under.
5,What an improvement over the old ones.,"Oh, my! I haven't seen anyone who bought the other (color) Typhoons have the melting problem described by the previous reviewer. I hope it's rare. This is my opinion. I'll let you know if it changes!My husband's favorite is creme brulee so I make it a lot. I have had 2 other torches & have been frustrated (another story). I decided to try a different style. I am VERY happy with this torch. It is very easy to fill & use. There is great control (flame strength) and the best part for me is I can hold it at any angle and it does not fluctuate in flame control or go out altogether when I hold it down. Dont' waste your money on those wands or cheapos out there. This feels good in control & weight. It has a ""safety switch"" too. Hard for kids to move it. A+"
5,A great cookbook!,"The polenta recipe alone is worth the price of the book. It is a no-stir recipe, and very easy.There is also a great chili recipe with lamb and beans. It is a very eclectic collection with some unusual and delicious dishes. It is a cookbook well worth having."
1,Waste of money,I bought this camera over a year ago and used it once. After having the pictures developed we never used it again.
5,Best Tool to Learn Remote Viewing,"I purchased these tapes and have been using them for some time now. I would say they are quite straight forward. As far as technique, the TRV tapes give you a step by step easy to learn process that anyone can follow.The tapes also inform you about how the process of Psi works. It is a skill that is trainable for almost anyone and highly effective. I was stunned by the results."
3,A Bigfoot story,"I consider this fiction, but it's a decent story. While parts of the story could have happened, I find I am a skeptic of this partiular story."
1,terrible,"I can not believe that,this book I have already wait over one month!until now I still not received it yet,I order it February 4th,today is March 7,I can not believe!!!I have to cancel this book,because I can not wait long time"
2,Don't Waste Your Time!,"I picked up this book after a recent obsession with the circus and circus performers. The cover looked promising as did the description. This book was hardly about the circus apart from the description of ""boning"" the limbless girl. I always find it concerning when I read a book I know I could have written better. The book read like a rough draft. There were very unsatisfactory descriptions and blunt, womanizing depictions of sex.The names and character profiles were even beyond belief, save your time don't read!"
1,Degrading Flick ! ! !,"The Contract stood in the ranking with no other movie that I've seen. Treach is the voice of a fella' named Bishop. His goal in life was to be a hit man if you will (A professional that's contracted to kill). The jobs that were assigned to Bishop were frivolous than those compared to a hit man. Bishop's roll was more like a gangbanger with a conscience. I know it doesn't make any sense, but neither does the movie.(((( I DIGRESS, BUT HERE'S MY DISLIKING ))))Harsh Profanity & Violence can be tasteful in certain movies but not cartoons."
5,Book,"Awesome to do business with, quick delivery and good price, would do business again and recommend anyone to buy from this person"
1,More of the same,"This book strikes me as any other books in its genere, nothing special. I think the author appeared on Dr. Phil. He should read Dr. Phil's book on a winning personality. To me these self help get rich quick new age plans are just a modern day pyramid scam. Who wouldn't want to buy a cool looking book with a bunch of happy people on the cover? Once the reader gets to about page 10, you realize it's just more of the same recycled schlock. By the way if you don't have a job, chances are you are not going to cough up 10 bucks for this peice of work. I got it off the free shelf at a used bookstore."
3,In search of a job!,"I have read this book and it really helped me in finding the job that I have right now. It was right after when I came out of college when I found about this book. One of the other things that really helped me was using[...]to look for jobs because it has jobs only from employer websites and far more jobs than you will find on other job boards. It helped me, hope it helps you too."
2,ok book,the book was ok but many of the tips were common sense. I went and looked online to find a better alternative and one of the best ones I found was [...]. It has alot more job listings than you would find on any other board and it has jobs directly from employer websites. Just a tip!
5,Great book. Extremely helpful.,"Beshara does a great job of hitting all the basics of an effective job search. It not only makes you think strategically about landing your next job, but provides lots of great tatical advice on how to succeed in the process."
3,Good Book,"I just started using this book. It's got some great reccomendations such as always having a routine when searching for a job, and having people and things in your life that make you happy can take some of the sting and stress out of looking.The ""scripts"" he reccommends are rude and arrogant and I would probably not hire someone who said those things to me. Mr. Beshara would actually have the job seeker tell the hiring manger ""I understand you have no jobs open, but I'm a top performer with a proven track record in-------- and I could replace your weakest link."" This may be okay if someone had a truly exceptional background such as an MBA from Harvard and 10 or more years of experince and impeccable references, otherwise not a good idea."
2,early Bad Religion,The recording quality is poor and it just isn't the same as 'adult' Bad Religion.
1,Inconsistent,"My husband bought me this scale as a birthday present. I have two complaints. The scale is 2-3lbs off (it underweighs). But, that's not all...The scale is inconsistent. You can step on it two different times in a ten minute spread and get two different weights. The weights usually vary by .5-2lbs. This scale's time is up. Time to shop!"
1,Save your money,"This scale was wretched. I stepped on it one second, and it said one thing. I stepped off, and ten seconds later tried again...wow! A COMPLETELY different answer! My husband tried it with the same results...or lack thereof, I should say"
3,Descent,"All wires are kind of very stiff, but I guess its supposed to be that way. I would recommend this works well."
3,Bit of a let down,"I bought this for the Couture/Belfort fight. Big mistake. The fight gets stopped due to an accidental cut to Randy's eye. There, I just saved you 20$."
2,questionable quality,"The watch itself and all its features are great, albeit somewhat bulky. However, I started wearing it and not 5 days later after MILD use (no exposure to heat, water, excessive sweat or stress on bands) the band on one side detached from the watch, so I had to send it back. Clearly a design/ manufacturing problem. Will replace it with a polar watch."
3,size does matter,The shirt was OK but I did return it for a refund. I went to order a larger size. It is difficult to order a shirt not knowing it would fit. I could of kept the shirt but did want to see how the next size would fit. It is all lot easier to purchase a shirt at a store than on the internet.
1,WestPoint Heated Mattress Pad,"This is the second heated mattress pad I have owned - I have waited this time for a review since the first one (a Sunbeam) only lasted 1 season. This one lasted almost 2 seasons. I purchased a full size pad, which has 1 control, which was great, when it was new. Now that I am into the second winter - I froze last night!!! One half of the pad quit! I looked at the waranty and it is good for 3 years, only problem is - I have to pay to return the pad -- that will be almost $20, and by the time it would come back it may be spring. This time I am going to try buying a little more expensive one - and from a local store (even though Amazon is GREAT and I buy all the time). That way when things go bad, hopefully I can just bring it back to the store. Just a note - Mine is 2 years old - so it is not the one pictured - but by the same manufacture - West Point."
4,Nice for the price!,"I ordered this heated mattress pad, because I live in a very old and drafty house. I needed something to warm the bed BEFORE I got into it. This pad was reasonably priced and I thought it was a good buy. However, you have to remember to turn the pad on before you get into bed! And then it takes a little while to warm up, so getting into bed is still a chilly experience. The item description did not mention that this pad turns itself off at random intervals. Maybe this particular pad was defective, but I can't seem to get a replacement or a reply from the company to find out if this is normal. All in all, the pad works reasonably well for the money, as long as you remember to turn it on a half hour before bedtime."
3,Man on Fire,"I gave this movie 3 stars because I like Glenn Scott and enjoyed the book by A.J.Quinell. If it wouldn't be for Glenn Scott I would rate this movie much lower. For those who read the book, this movie would be a great disappointment as it was for me. But as with all great books, one gets lured into a joy that a favored book made it to the screen. This one did it - limping."
3,"Not as good as ""In a stranger's Arms""","I only bought this book because I absolutely LOVED ""In a Stranger's Arms"". Unfortunately, this book just doesn't have the same flow or chemistry. I'm enjoying most of it, but there is TOO much dialogue. I'm finding myself flipping through most of it, which is something I hate to do. Considering I've read ""Stranger"" about three times since I got it, I'm very disappointed in ""Worth Any Price"". I personally can't see what Nick sees in Lottie, and the book delves more into his relationship with the men in his life than her. Get this one at the library!"
4,From the hero's point of view,"Kleypas writes well, and I enjoyed this even though (as mentioned by others) the plot's a little unbelievable. It was a nice change to read a book that seemed mainly on the guy than the girl though.I'd agree that Nick's big secret didn't seem particularly serious considering his hangups, and that Charlotte's was worth looking deeper into. And yeah, I would have been more impressed if the story had been about Radnor/Howards/Charlotte.It would be a pity if this is the last of the Bow Street Runner books. I liked the 1st 2, and always wondered what would happened to Nick Gentry. Now I'm wondering what happened to Charlotte's sisters, especially Ellie."
5,Realism Can Be Beautiful Too,"If you want to feel that there's hope for human-kind, that kindness, generousity, and patience are everyday virtues, that one can be clear-eyed and not be cynical, you will probably like this film. I revelled in the timeless calm and playful atmosphere of this little movie. A firm five-star, thumbs-up! I expect that most viewers will wish they had experienced such a school year, and such a master teacher."
5,Blanche is at it again She indeed Passes Go,"Barbara Neeley in Blanche Passes Go has yet written another supurb black feminist text. What makes this so well written is you don't realize the issues are so deep and multi leveled as you are in the process of reading the book. She is able to give many classic examples of class race and sex in terms of abuse of the black american women. She also has the ability to bring you in to the mystery even if mystery is not your favorate spear. She has dead folks all around with, Carolina catering recipes abounding in the book my mouth was watering. She solves a mystery but more importanly, why do men abuse women? Rape, physical as well as mental abuse are also examined. The silence these women must suffer are explored. Read it is great."
3,An AWA Book that reflects why the AWA went under,"In an attempt to join the bandwagon of Pro Wrestling books, Larry Nelson had a great idea. Too bad that he loved these people so much, that he was afraid to actually name some of the actual men and women that starred in the more interesting aspects of the bussiness. The book is shallow and leaves you thinking if Verne held Larry on a Headlock, to shut his mouth. The book is entertaining, although I would not recommend it to anyone under 21 or still in awe of the bussiness (MARKS) it infers that the reader already has a knowledge of the bussiness and its darker side, while leaving a lot of room for imagination.Not a bad attempt, but I bet you that Larry has a LOT more stories, of the wild and fun world of Pro Wrestling."
3,Not worth it.,"It does include hits but it also includes songs that no one has ever heard of even back in 1986 such as ""French Kissin' in the USA"" by Debbie Harry which wasn't even a hi8t she didn't have another hit after Rapture. Anyways this collection is a not buy just buy a different collection."
3,Tillers,Hi this is product that I have been looking for. I have a small yard and do not need a big tiller and you are the only place where I have found it. Thank You!
4,Box Torn up because of weight,"This thing is heavy!!! so heavy that when it was shipped to my place, the box that came with it could not hold the floor jack and things were poking out of the box. All the styrofoam inside was squished and torn. I feel sorry for whoever is carrying and shipping this thing. I know I would hate it.I ended up with some minor scratches when receiving, I didn""t mind. its going to get scratched up anyways in my garage. Besides, you could repaint it if you really really want it that nice looking.Used it a few times. works great like its supposed to on my 1998 Toyota Avalon. This seems like it will last me forever.Great buy if you don""t have one."
5,Messiah as it should be,"This is a wonderful performance, and even though the dumb cover states it is in Italian it is NOT! It's a great English language performance. There are no negatives about this performance, and lots of positives. In my opinion, the ""trumpet concerto"" (The trumpet shall sound) in part 3 is worth the cost of the DVD. The baroque trumpet is outstanding, and coupled with the performance of bass David Thomas, it just can't be beat. Buy this DVD just for this part, then enjoy the rest of it ... you will not be disappointed."
3,Maybe it's me...,"Bought this for one specific purpose - and it doesn't work for me. Despite recipe with 1/3 butter, dough sticks, and is useless for my purposes. Seems to be made with decent quality, and I may find some other useful task for this..."
2,Light on Application,"I was disappointed by 'Living with Less' because I was hoping for a book that would give me some very specific applications on downsizing my life - from a biblical perspective. Instead, what I got was really a book about following the things that really matter to your life and to Christ. Don't get me wrong, there's nothing wrong with that. But there are a great many authors and books that do that in a much deeper and more complete way. I reccomend ""Don't Waste Your Life"" by John Piper and ""The Cross Centered Life"" by CJ Mahaney. Just be aware that this book will NOT include a whole lot of instructions on ""Living with Less."""
1,AWFUL. Just AWFUL,I agree with D. Katz 100 percent. This item is horrible. I bought it at 5 dollars and I still regret it. The worst thing is that it is looks horrible. If it performed badly at least I could look good but it didn't even have that.
5,Funny British Comedy,"Bean's Rowan Atkinson stars in yet another funny British show. The Thin Blue Line is one of my favorite sitcoms, loaded with tons and tons of the funniest jokes you will ever here. Just to warn you, this whow may not be as appropriate as some parents would like."
4,almost complete but still splendid,"this dvd box set really gives the show the credit it deserves with series1 and the xmas special on disc1,the complete series2 on disc2 and some intresting extras on disc 3.The reason its not a 5star product is because it has scenes missing from the show.To get the real complete line up of the show you would have to buy the complete thin blue line region2 dvd= the whole show, all 14 episodes unedited.this is still one of the best uk sitcoms ever writen.A BEN ELTON COMEDY AT ITS BEST AND A PERFECT CAST."
4,Excellent for Beginners,"I received this as a gift. Being that I've been an eBay PowerSeller on several different accounts, I honestly didn't think I'd learn much from this.I might have simply put the book down after the first chapter, but one thing I can say about Joseph Sinclair is that he is very easy to read. I ended up reading nearly everything in there. And even though I already knew most of what's in there, I did end up learning quite a bit, and was able to take a new perspective on everything that I already knew.Overall, I'd say this book is best for those new to selling on eBay, but even the most hardened eBay vets will be able to grab scraps of goodness from it."
5,A book that will change your life,"Dinnerstein's thesis is that many of the neurotic features (e.g. sexism, self-hatred, exploitation of nature...) of the present human condition emerge as a direct result of the fact our earliest parent is most often and most consistently female. Drawing on a variety of theories and sources such as psychoanalysis, feminism, and literature, she paints a disconcerting picture of the human present and future; a picture that she hopes will, given its simple and ingenious solution, spur us to change. She lays out her argument lucidly and with brutal thoroughness, coaxing even the most unwiling reader's complete argreement. The implications of this book for humanity are ignored only at our great peril."
5,Premier Pet KeepSafe Break-Away Collar,"This is the best collar on the market:practical, rugged, awesome, need I say more? I have two dogs that each have one and they are very active and they have gotten caught in cituiations that requied the collar to break, great feature, also great price."
3,"OK, so it's not the best book you'll ever read...","...but while I respect the opinions of my fellow reviewers, please give this one a chance. EVERYONE out there---straight AND gay---can relate in one way or another to one or more of the personal declarations in this anthology. What is of interest here is the inflexible march of time and how things change and evolve as the clock ticks on...from oldest to youngest, the contributors share with us a chronicle of feelings, perceptions, fears, hopes, expectations, aspirations, losses---you name it, the list is almost endless---not only for themselves but their families, friends and loved ones as well. Leave your judgement behind---this is real life and it really happens, whether or not you choose to believe or accept it."
5,Bill Monroe's Collection of Classics,"Wow, Bill Monroe was highest caliber of talent in Bluegrass. All of the songs of this collection are awesome. Bill Monroe demanded and got perfection from himself to his band."
3,Gift for a bluegrass lover,"This is not something I would buy for myself, but the person I gave it to seemed pleased with it although he told me he's more a fan of the Monroe brothers. Oh well. My best evaluation is that it's a fine recording for those who like this type of music."
2,Misleading picture!,"I ordered this product because I had objects that were too large to fit in the more commonly found 3-divider version of this box (i.e. horizontal dividers, obviously the vertical ones are adjustable). Based on the picture and what seemed to make sense, I assumed that the two-divider version had the center divider placed in the middle; it is actually just like the three-divider version with one divider removed (i.e. it's divided into 1/3 and 2/3 of the total space, not 1/2 and 1/2). This make the box unusable for me. I wish the picture was more illustrative of this. In fact I will add my own picture that will clear this up."
2,better production,"I totally agree with Robert Swinney, the version of this play with Warren Mitchell as Shylock is by far the superior production. What a pity that you don't present more than the one version."
1,Booooooooooooooooooooooo,"the reason this gets a 1 star is due to the fact that they failed to leave only the best song to come out in 1984, that being Joe Espositos ""You're the Best Around"" most notably seen in the first film of Karate Kid (during the breath taking all valley karate tournament montage) now that's what I CALL MUSIC! I was just discussing with Lupus Fury the stupidity of the people that put this album out, how could they skip over this song??? they should rename this album ""Now that's what I call a gigantic rip-off because we failed to include Joe Esposito""that sounds much better."
4,Oldies but goldies,"Vacuum tubes technology, a must for electronics technicians and engineers only 30 years ago, has limited its action to a few applications. One of them, and for artistical reasons, is audio amplifiers. But the main application nowadays, is RF high power amplifiers. Radio and TV transmitters, for example. One single tube is able to handle the whole power driven by the final stage of the transmitter. That is sometimes an adventage for engineers. But anyway, there still are thousands of transmitters in the world that are using high power tubes. I work on one of them, and this book is the ONLY ONE, and I mean this, that has allowed me to know the deepest secrets of this technology that, of course, was never taught to me this deep in college. By the way, the historical background the author gives us is very amusing. Read the book and you will know why."
4,I like it.......buying a second one.,"I feel compelled to write my first review cuz this item should have at least 4 stars.I'm back buying my second.This is easily the most attractive of all the feeders I've seen so far and I'd like to address the two negative reviews.I've had this feeder for over a year now and we have a ton of grey squirrels but none have ever figured out how to get seed from it. When it is shaken, the seed mostly drops in the tray. That said....the population of red tree squirrels is increasing recently and they are able to climb right through the caging. They sit inside and will even let me walk up to the feeder at times. I don't have a problem with these small squirrel, it's the greys that are destructive. And lastly another review mentioned plastic hanger......it's actually metal wire with a plastic coating.Buy it......you'll love it."
2,Gimmicky,"This performance is a ""cutesy"" one, replete with little swells in the musical line, exaggerated dynamic contrasts, and rhythmic breaks that collectively weaken the overall impact of the music."
5,Fantanstic!,"What can I say about this record? How about fantastic! I loved this CD and I love the Wolfe Tones! Great Music and Great Lessons. It's a shame that some very narrow minded people don't like them. Alas, the opinon of a fool can not keep me from enjoying the great Wolfe Tones! Who are, by the way, very well loved in Ireland."
1,Watch Out!,I found the author to be very disturbing. The only reason I'm hangind onto this book for awhile is to see if it increases in value with time in the event the author should reach the Ted Bundy acclaim to fame.
3,"Interesting facts, but what do you do with them?","I'll make my review short and sweet. I applaud Jason for his efforts. It took a lot of guts to do what he did. He is a very bright person with great potential. For a freshman book, it is not bad. I will make one, and only one criticism. He should have collaborated with a seasoned forensic pyschologist in order to give this book some real bite. Maybe in his sophomore effort he will give this a try. I look forward to Jason's future productions. If I didn't study so hard for law school, I probably would have done the same. Happy reading!"
2,Required editing and further information,"As a fellow UNLV honors graduate, I was disappointed at the casual writing style and numerous gramatical errors. I also thought that Jason became too intrigued with Gacy. He hardly gives his reader a glimpse into the behaviors of the other killers that he contacted. He placed his family in real and serious danger to prove his own worth, yet this book does not seem to be a worthy product of that risk."
2,The Last Victim Revisited,"I read this book when it was originally published. I knew the author and his family quite well so my mind was probably more receptive to it being a ""great"" book. Alas, upon re-reading it, I realize that it is not a ""great"" book at all but a fairly mediocre one. It is obviously written by a ""first time"" author and has an almost child-like narrative form. To give credit where it is due, however, it is nonetheless, disturbing and the guy had guts. I am sad to report that the author took his own life in early June of this year. That is the reason that I decided to read this book again to see if I could find any insight into why he would do this tragic thing...I think I did."
1,Worst book i have read in years,i am sorry I believed any of the good reviews about this piece of trash. It seems like the whole book is just the authors erotic fantasy. You would hsve to a moron to believe that a visitor at any maximum security prison would be led in and left with a serial killer unguarded.
2,Confused,"After reading this book I am a little confused on how exactly I felt about it. As with other readers, I was also skeptical about everything Jason Moss stated in his book about certain correspondence he claimed he had. I was also sick of hearing about his poor life, fights with his mom and so on. I was however a little disturbed about his relationship with Gacy and the fact his family seemed ""OK"" with it and the lengths he went to build this relationship. The book gave me the eww factor I think more then anything. Would I recommend this book, probably, but only to skip through it at the local library."
2,Very disturbing!,"I found this book to be a highly disturbing account of a young man's need for acceptance, manipuation and control of those who are mentally weak. It leaves me with many unanswered questions. In reading this account, I was highly disturbed by someone using manipulation and control to gain trust with these violent people who are very much victims themselves of mental illness. Moss has demonstrated that he is able to apply the same principals of manipulation, deceit and control as these violent predators. I'm am left saddened that someone would feel the need to resort to these tactics to enter the psych of the mentally disturbed. Does that make Moss a hero, or a predator of those who are mentally unable to think clearly and act appropriately. Does he then not become a predator to them?"
3,"Doritos, cigarettes and crime stories.","While reading this book, I had two distinct feelings at the same time. My supposedly educated self felt it was getting the shaft. My Doritos-eating, GPC-smoking side couldn't put it down. While not a work of art, the book does offer a dose of mindless entertainment for true crime readers."
1,Terrible Book!,"The author apparently had alot of spare time to mess with serial killers. All poor Jeff Dahmer needed was to be loved.Too bad John Wayne Gacy didn't make soup out of the author.The worst of all the books on serial killers I've read.I wanted to use no stars, but, I had to choose one :("
2,"A mediocre book written by an obvious ""non-author""","The idea was there, but it's obvious that Jason Moss doesn't need to continue writing. I was extremely disappointed in this purchase. I forced myself to finish this book simply because I refuse to quit reading anything in the middle. Jason should have let someone else represent his story for him. I think that would be too much to ask from some one as self-absorbed as Jason Moss. If you insist on buying this book, skip around through the communications with the criminals. Do not expect to enjoy anything else..."
4,Intriguing look into the mind of the author,"The author is almost maniacally driven to succeed in all areas of his life, and I think I find his motivation more disturbing than the actual interaction he has with these serial killers. The events that occurred after writing to these killers were not shocking to me, it was the naivety and denial the author was in to prove his self worthy of the attention they bestowed on him.I find it a little odd that he did not share more than a few excerpts of the letters that he and Gacy wrote to each other. It is almost as if he is still treasuring them and wants to tease the reader with what few paragraphs he gave us. I could not imagine spending my Sunday afternoons on the phone with Gacy, with this kind of dedication to his ""project"" it makes me wonder if he were becoming the Jason Moss he invented.One more thing, Jasons' parents were stupid to let him go to Illinois alone to visit Gacy in jail."
1,"Better than watching TV reruns, but not much else","With a behavioral psychology background, I was drawn to the subject of the book as well as to the ""fresh"" perspective of its young author. What a disappointment. Toward the end, I could barely suppress my urge to trash this self-serving excuse for a book. The book's content is greatly lacking, unless you enjoy reading about the inner thoughts of egotistical teens. As compared to more ""scholarly"" works, the text was sorely lacking in documentation and references to other studies of the subject. Spend your money on something more worthwhile."
1,mausoleum,"this movie would not play in my dvd player only my computer,it's deffinitly not worth the price i paid. POOR picture quality,all the good gory scenes were cut out. would not recommend this movie to anyone......"
5,Excellent!,One of the most detailed and comprehensive regional ichthyofaunal guides available. A must for the freshwater fisheries biologist.
5,"Not Wilson's best, but worth your time","Great beginning and ending. While the work lags somewhat in the middle the nuance of characterization and skill in exploring the small individual choices that people face in this scenario. The wide cast and non-judgmental ambiguity helps ground the surreal premise in an effective human narrative.This, combined with the uniqueness and skill in crafting the alternate world's politics and religion make this a highly engaging work. Not as good as Robert Charles Wilson's Darwinia or The Chronoliths, but a fine addition to the field of scifi."
2,Very Hard to Unlock!!!,"This cap is extremely difficult to unlock.. It takes two hands and long fingers to hold the key and turn the cap at the same time. The key will not stay in the unlocking position so you can turn the cap with one hand as other caps I have used.. If it's raining,,, forget it because you hands are too wet!!!"
5,Right to the point -- the perfect manual for GarageBand!,"I bought several books on how GarageBand works and while some had some helpful hints, the author of this book, Bob LeVitus, knows what he's talking about. Every sentence and page has valuable advice on how this thing, ""GarageBand"", really works. He also includes the limitations of GarageBand and alternative software suggestions for more elaborate recording needs. The author is very knowledgable about home-studio recording and he has excellent suggestions on microphones, speakers, and inexpensive technical gear incl. audio interfaces, etc. that will make your recording project a professional adventure. This book is so interesting and has so many useful tips, etc. that everyone playing around with GarageBand should read it in order to easily use this Apple application and to get the most out of it -- saving you a lot of frustration at the same time."
5,Akebono Pads - Great!,"I have used Akebono pads on at least half a dozen cars, and they've been great! Low noise, low dust, perfect!"
2,xpw what???,this is supposed to be better than ecw was???ecw was the innovator of extreme wrestling and this @***is just @#$*.rob black should and needs to stay in the xxx movie biz and cut his loses xpw really really sucks i wouldnt recommend anyone whose a true wrestling fan to order anything from xpw...period
2,Skip this one,"This was a quick read and it was okay. I felt like the hero Ky was just a 1 dimensional character. Kate was a little more developed, but not much. I didn't like how there wasnt much of a story or hardly any secondary characters. Kys brother and wife were briefly mentioned, but outside of that no secondary characters to bring more life to the story. I just felt the story was flat and it seemed like a lot of the relationship focused on sex and the treasure hunt. I wanted to put the book down, but I only kept reading just to see what happened at the end and not much happened. I know this book is one of Nora Roberts earlier works and I know her books have gotten much better since then. At least the ones I have read so far. Also when I was reading this book it reminded of Daniel Steels writing for some reason."
3,"Treasures Lost, Treasures Found",Really did not like this novel very much. I could almost know what will happen next. I did not feel it is one of Nora Roberts better books.
3,Good,"It was a light book. Nice to read, but nothing outstanding. Nora Roberts has better books than this one. Hope this is helpful."
5,Lifesaver,"I looked at this little tool and said, ""well, I guess I'll give it a try...sigh"", but I read the instructions, slid it over the broken tap, and backed the broken little sucker right out. AWESOME!"
3,Wow!,"I'd been looking for a neutral mix that I could mix with juice and fruit. I found this and all I could find were good reviews. The ingredient list and nutrient lists looked great. I opened the canister and it had a pleasant mild vanilla scent. My first try I mixed it with milk, vanilla yogurt, some vanilla sugar free pudding mix and frozen strawberries. Sounds great, right? Put it thru the blender and OMG! it was the most vile, disgusting concoction I have ever smelled or tasted! I could only choke down a few swallows. I was so disappointed. And I don't have a picky palate. Later I tried it again, this time with OJ and strawberries. It was just as bad, came out green. I haven't decided yet if I'm going to send it back. Maybe I can get used to it. Maybe it's PMS messing with my taste buds, but, nothing else tastes bad. We'll see."
1,Janina's (from Canada) review is totally right!,"Anyone in the world who actually took the time to learn of his life and miracles would be transformed. I am one of them. And as Janina said on her review: ""We need some talent like Mel Gibson to proclaim his life to the world."" He would make a huge favor to humanity."
2,For fun...only if you want a huge gigantic pond!!!,"What a disappointment. I was hoping this would help guide me in the right direction as we are considering a small pond for our ducks who currently use a pool. This booklet is only for massive ponds. It's only for food and fun, not for food or fun."
5,"Dear Salada, *please* bring this back! Even if but once a year!","This tea was addictive in the best way possible. Everything about it was perfection. Perfect color, perfect aroma, perfect taste, perfect 'dry bite' to it. I continue to look for this tea every time I shop (online or in brick-and-mortar stores), and I dream of a day when I find it again.P.S. In the mean time, I have found a rough replacement inZhena's Gypsy Tea, Earl Green, 22-Count Tea Sachets (Pack of 6), but it still is just no match for this Salada version."
5,Awsome,MOnster hunter freedom is my favorite game of all time. it is so fun. the action won't stop. There are also so many cool armor and weapons. IN this game you fight a lot of creatures. In this you you migh get stuck. Later you might be able to pass it after you keep on trying.
3,Not as good as I thought would be,This game is too complicated and isn't as fun as an average person may think. The point of the game is to kill monsters- end of story. Dull and boring
1,new to archery,"This video was not helpful for archery instruction. However, it was narrated by Ronald Reagen. It was produced in the late 1940's. It features Howard Hill known as the ""World's Greatest Archer."" This video could be of interest to buffs of odd, old films. I did find it entertaining. The film gives a good sense of the culture at that time. It's full of sexism and dangerous archery tricks involving women down range without the warning, ""Kids don't try this at home."" Not for archers, feminists or peta memembers. He kills a jaguar which is termed ""the devil cat."""
4,awesome!,"My hamster really liked the blue circle tube! The loop is bigger than the normal tubing, which is great because my hamster is big. :) 100% satisfaction."
3,Plastic is easily chewed away by gerbils,The base cage of this collection has metal sides and top that is very durable. These tubes however are made of a plastic that rodents with sharp teeth can chew through fairly quickly. Have had to use tape to patch a few spots that have been eroded.
3,Hamster escape,My daughter has a very clever hamster that we should of named Houdini instead of Mr. Whiskers. Some how he weighs the tubes down and they fall of easily from where they are connected to the cage itself. Maybe not a bad product just a bad Hamster.
4,One of the original Blueprints for the New Age,"If you are lucky enough to have obtained one of these books many years ago, you like me will be keeping it for the rest of your life. I believe there were few that discovered new techniques the west could adopt without running around with a bindi on your forhead of chanting words that mean nothing to your trained brain or birth spirit. Not much published is new to the New Age since this book, save your time, money and sanity and work backwards from here with a copy of Brian Grattan's Mahatma I & II and possibly Autobiography of a Yogi."
4,Incredibly difficult to find but worth it,"I have been looking for this CD for a very long time; I really just wanted to download tracks #3 (Myoho) and #6 (Bois de Boulogne: Theme and Improvisations) but it is not available ANYWHERE. The others are a little repetitive. This is reminiscent of the 80's new age electronic music (actually, it IS 80's new age electronic music)."
2,careful: this is not the full soundtrack.,the CD is far from featuring all the songs played in the film. Repeats two or three several times. Classical music only. This is not the actual soundtrack!
2,"Great story, poorly written.","I was really looking forward to reading this book but getting through it was a struggle. The writing is amateurish and clumsy. There is so little factual information that at times I began to feel that the credibility of the story was in question; better identification of the accompanying photos, for a start, would have been helpful.These gripes aside, it's obvious that the author loved this elephant very much. If you can get past the clunky writing style and some of the icky-sticky New Age philosophy, it's not a bad read."
5,Modoc,"Everyone should read ""Modoc"". It is a great read and an inspiring true story.No matter what your subject preference in reading is, you will enjoy this book."
5,Incredible!,"This is a fantastic book and stands as the only book outside of Murakami's Hard-Boiled Wonderland and McCarthy's The Road that I've actually felt compelled to buy and give to others. I read the book solely because it too was pushed my way by someone urging me to read it despite it not being my typical cup of tea. The story was fantastic and every bit the tear-jerker you've read about elsewhere. A triumph of spirit and the bond that can be built between man and animal. I cried like a blubbering baby in my backyard while turning the pages of this book - and have enjoyed inflicting the same upon others. It's really, really good - and not just for animal lovers. Beats the heck out of stinker Life Of Pi too."
5,The greatest love story ever written,"If you are an animal lover, this is the book to read. Be prepared to use up a box of tissues!This is my favorite book of all time. They are missing a great opportunity by not making a movie of this story. Be aware, it is an intense story all the way through."
5,Elephants are a miracle,"It may not be the most well written book I have ever read, but I guarantee that you willNEVER look at an elephant again the same way that you did before reading about Modoc. If only I had the room, I would have an elephant in my back yard."
5,The Greatest Elephant!,"If you love animals, this is a must read. Amazing what this elephant and his best friend went thru. Was able to get right into the story and was engrossed thru the whole book. Wished it had never ended."
2,Lackluster,"My bookclub picked this title for our read a couple months ago. I wanted to be excited about this book, I love elephants, though i'm not a great fan of the circus. But, there didn't seem to be any highlight to the book, everything was about the same intensity, there were few highs and few lows.This book did do one great thing for me; it gave me the motivation to read the other books collecting on my shelf!"
1,"Good story, but poorly written.","I am surprised by the overly positive reviews. The dialog is bland and contrived. The author attempted to fictionalize entire scenes out of scant detail. I would really like to read a well researched, nonfiction biography of Gunterstein and Modoc. It is written with almost no sense of time. At the end of the book, I was entirely surprised to learn 78 years had transpired. How long were they in India? Were world events irrelevant? How did Gertie and Bram support themselves during their search for Modoc? How long did they search? So many questions and NO ANSWERS! I'm sure the North Circus has some history. Do Gertie and Bram have any progeny?"
2,Let's Be Honest,"""The True Story of the Greatest Elephant That Ever Lived"" - that should have tipped me off. Not only was this story implausible and undocumented, it absolutely gushed with admiration and enthusiasm for the subject. It was as if every sentence ended with an exclamation mark. I found this immensely annoying, and it caused me to enjoy the book less than I might have otherwise. Some reviewers have said it wasn't true, but was still a well-written, exciting story. I beg to differ. The conversations were stiff, the descriptive passages were too elaborate, and the over-all style reminded me of my 8th grade English students. I would not have finished this book if it hadn't been a selection of my book group."
5,Top of the line sponge,This is a very nice and soft sponge. Works very well as a facial cleaning sponge but would work as a bath sponge nicely.
3,"Beautifully done, but wrong for my own purposes - your mileage may vary","In retrospect and to be honest, I ordered this book by mistake. The book I really wanted (and eventually got) was Francoise Giroud's spectacular _Christian Dior_ (which I've also reviewed for Amazon). This book is a retrospective of a Dior exhibition at the Museum of Metropolitian Art in 1997, and as such is a comprehensive, beautifully created overview of the exhibit, with several hundred outstanding photographs - many in full-page format - of the dresses of Dior's classic period from 1947 to 1957. The problem from my own standpoint is that the ""models"" in this book are all mannequins. What I need (for my website, and my own research) are pictures of the dresses and gowns as they were worn by real people. Therefore this book fell short of my own (erroneous) expectations - but it needn't fall short of yours; if you know what you're getting, it's a more than worthy volume."
2,Can't compare to actual Birkenstock,"After wearing them for a while I decided to buy actual Birkenstock clogs. These ones never felt right on my feet, the leather material is of terrible quality and the sizing was way off. One of very few unhappy purchases I've made through amazon (obviously its not their fault)."
1,The only dummy is the person who buys this book,Just read the 7th edition--it only took a couple of hours to go through it. It is a schill for AOL and Geo-Cities. It also pushes Netscape Composer which is probably an out of date web design package. Briefly describes HTML in a very very basic manner. You will not be able to get a web page up with what is published in this book. The book convinced me to get a copy of Frontpage.
5,Outstanding support,"I used this volume for a 13 week Sunday School study of Hebrews, along with multiple other references. This is the one from which I learned the most, and I used it extensively to guide my approach in challenging the class to make life changes with regards to living a life of faith. Easy to read, thorough, and highly practical."
3,The Duke tries to attone for a lost opportunity.,"John Wayne wasn't just considered for the role of Dirty Harry, he was the top choice. The role was his for the taking. He looked at the script and was intrigued, but he felt it was a little too hard edged for his fans to accept so he passed. Of course, Clint Eastwood took the role and the movie became a huge hit and a classic. When the Duke saw ""Dirty Harry"" he realized he had made a big mistake passing on it. It was too late to change the past so he did the next best thing which was to have his own Dirty Harry-like movie and call it ""McQ.""Unfortunately, ""McQ"" lacks the taunt script of ""Dirty Harry"" and it meanders along very slowly. The performances are good. The Duke, Eddie Albert, and Al Leiteri are all fine. Colleen Dewhurst is fantastic in her short amount of screen time. Yet they cannot cover up the weak script. The end result was ""Dirty Harry Lite"" and a rather forgettable film. An ok movie; but no ""Dirty Harry."""
4,John Wayne may be older but he can still dish it out.,"If you can get past a near 70 year old John Wayne driving a Trans-Am this movie is very enjoyable. Wayne continues his typical role of a good guy who follows his own set of rules. This movie helped begin the modern crime action films that emerged in the early 70's and Wayne is quite believable in this role. The action is fast paced and the story is intriguing. The suprise ending is good as is the ending shoot out. This may not be one of ""The Duke's"" more remembered movies but should be added to any John Wayne or action movie collections."
4,"Look for Tom Valentine's old buddy Eddie Albert and future Magnum, p.i. star Roger E. Mosely in here, too","John Wayne was so busy pumping outWesterns with his crew/family in'71 that he had to turn Dirty Harry,which ended up being done superblyby a (then) novice named ClintonEastwood, Jr. (age 30). By '74, w/Westerns going the way of the Buffalo,Wayne was talked into this fine filmrole by a very underrated Directornamed John Sturgis. Moves a bit slow-er than we would like, and 'The Duke'was a bit slow by then as well. Butthis film and his next (see my reviewof Branigan) were two of his best mademovies in his remarkable 50 yrs. infilm. Wayne was born in 1907 in Iowaand his birth house is still therefor visitors to see."
2,Bad undercard!,"The undercard for this event in quite terrible, no good fights untill Kaos vs. New Jack, and thats only good after the match ends and GQ Money comes out.The only really good match on the disc in the exploding ring deathmatch between Grimes and Supreme, but even this match has its flaws. Unlike the infamous Terry Funk, Cactus Jack exploding ring deathmatches, the explosives are next to the beds of barbed wire and not under them, so really it just looks like a fireworks display next to the wrestler when they land on them. So you have to ask yourself is one really good match worth the [money] you have to pay for this disc? The DVD comes with these extras, match histories and a XPW ""best of"" video clip which is pretty cool."
5,For anyone who loves motorcycle stories,"Not as good as the first ""Leanings"", but an enjoyable read anyway. Peter writes in a way that I wish I could write to convey my motorcycle experiences. I also subscribe to Cycle World and have seen some of these same writings, but I throw away magazines, while I will keep this book forever and be able to re-read at my leasure. I would recommend this book highly."
5,Excellent Egan,"Being a sports car enthusiast, I have read and loved all of Peter Egan's automotive writings. Wanting more I read both Leanings books. The same excellent writing, just about bikes!"
2,Leanings 2,I love Peter Egan's writing in Cycle World. This was a chance to review past work and some writing which I had missed. He has a style that connects to the average rider and sometimes see things in a new light.
3,An insider's view of Insider's Paris,Who wouldn't be tempted to peek into the window of an incredibly chic Parisian maison? Here's your chance. How did the editors convince these fabulous homeowners to open their doors and even some of their receipe files?
3,Funny but could have been funnier,"STORIES FROM A MORON, like the LETTERS FROM A NUT books, is a series of letters to various magazines, submitting all sorts of wacky and just plain odd stories to them. Stories that are clearly not worthy of publication and especially not worthy of publication in the type of magazine it is being submitted to.At times, it is very funny. Especially the writer's dealings with Fencing Quarterly. He submits a story that has nothing to do with fencing, gets a polite reply, then adds all sorts of fencing references to a still not fencing relating story and resubmits it. Very funny stuff.Although, my main problem with the book is that the focus is more on the stories that are submitted than on the replies (which are funnier). Plus, we don't get to read the query letters that were sent with the stories. Just the story, and then later in the chapter, some of the replies.It is worth reading, but it just isn't up to the LETTERS FROM A NUT series."
3,Dolor spot light,The solar spot light is not as bright as it indicated on the website or on the box packaging. I wish their was a capability to attach the light to a flag pole.
1,Bought it this past summer after I ran a spotlight over with the mower,At first it was great. Bright enough to light the tree or the flag. Now since late November.. its dead. That's insane. My cheap solar lights from Lowe's which I bought for 3.00 each are still working even after a Long Island Winter.
1,Piece of Junk - Do NOT buy this item.,"Was torn between varying reviews about this Solar Powered light.Went ahead and purchased it anyhow, much to my displeasure.The unit works but is very dim even in the darkest locations.The solar collector which pivots on the unit broke within minutes of installation.Don't waste your time or money."
4,Good light but uses up battery fast,"These lights are quite nice in that they seem sturdy (for a plastic light) and quite bright. I am giving them four rather than five stars because I find that a full-day of solar charge (and I live in sunny Southern Arizona where right now a full day means 10+hrs of sunlight w/ few or no clouds) only provides battery power for a few hours at night. I purchased two lights and have found the same with both. I have other similar lights from a different manufacturer that are smaller and not as bright but last for several more hours, so I guess it is a tradeoff."
2,Very bright but not weather resistant,"I bought several of these about 4 months ago and had been 100% satisfied with their build quality and brightness. During our first rainfall of the season, however, I noticed a few of them flickering on/off and then several of them (I bought 5 total) stopped working entirely now, even days after the downpour. I suppose that some water got into the electrical/battery system..."
1,Kind of dissapointed.,"I must say that I am not too impressed with this product, it has a very weak glow and only lasts at the most, 5 hrs. Sorry, no good review here!"
2,A typical David Stern book - Not worth buying,If you want commentary on the New Testament from a true Jewish perspective I would recommend Amy-Jill Levine's version. This commentary is written by David Stern and his book is written from that of a Baptist minister's perspective.
3,It Was ok.,"I bought this book cos I thot it would give some detailed background to Jewish practices. It only does this in some instances. The focus seems to be on Messianic Jews mostly. There is some useful information in terms of history etc, but not what I expected."
2,Not up to Kleypas's normal standard,"I fell in love with Lisa kleypas after first reading the Suddenly you & have read nearly all of her novels but this is my least favorite. Her novels are usually filled with amazing dialog & humor but this one...not so much.The characters are in love & have some hot kissing scenes as ""kids"", then her Dad finds out & banishes him. She's injured in a fire & can't stand the thought of someone seeing her ""disfigured"" legs so she never marries and remains a virgin. Couple years later, Dad is dead, hero is a rich American now & comes back for revenge but finds love & doesn't care about her scars...there, now you don't have to read it."
2,Kleypas phoned it in,"First let me say that I am a big fan of Kleypas' writing. I have read all of her books multiple times. I was disappointed in this latest effort. In my opinion, it did not break new grond or have the emotional impact of other novels. The characters are hollow and she rehashes class conflict and Victorian sensibilities that she already explored in better fashion in previous novels.Just reread old ones."
4,Great Book,"I thought the best part of the story was the Olivia and Shaw story line. Aline kind of got on my nerves with the whole oh my god I am burned and my legs are scarred so he won't love me. And at the end of the book even her own family is telling her how stupid and vain she is being. I mean to be so cold to the poor guy just because she was not perfect. But like I said, I loved the flawed character of Gideon Shaw. And I especially liked Olivia and I wish this book was thier story instead. I like that she was so practical about her love for him and told him she did not want him to stop drinking for her, but that it wouldn't stop them from having an affair."
3,not her best but not bad,"This book was so so, I guess i just felt like something was missing. I think the plot was just to thin and it needed some more substance. The ""hero"" of this story is too keen on vengence and i only wished that she had shown more of this charater's heart. I recommend this book for leasure and just for sitting by the pool."
2,Ho-Hum,"I am not a great fan of the 'great misunderstanding' plot device. And not much character development went on with the major characters. We were 'told' not 'shown' what they were like.That said, I loved the 'secondary' romance between Livia and Gideon. I found it much more interesting and less predictable. For me, they stole the book. [And I can't help wondering if they did for Kleypas too, since she ended the book on their story.]This is the last Kleypas I will just buy off the shelf without reading reviews first. She's like the little girl with the curl, 'when she's good, she's very good, and when she's bad, she's horrid.'"
3,Readable but not Memorable,"I found this book to be a bit of a disappointment. I agree with the other reviewers that the Livia-Gideon story was far more compelling. McKenna and Aline just didn't have the sweetness or innocence that the other characters had. Instead, they seemed silly and self-important."
2,Not the best,"I loved the begining but the heroin got tireing after his return. She doesn't desearve him. As he yelled at her at the end. ""You were going to make me misserable my hole life because of these scares. You didn't think I loved you enough to overlook them."" I liked the sisters story better. It went on too long. Of course if she explained after they had sex it would have been O.K. but that would mean the end of their story line but she could have used the rest of the book for her sisters story. I think she would be better off writing shorter stories. A part of the book Marcus says Giddian will just use her and brake Livies hart to Aline.Aline says were stronger than you think. This coming from a woman who wouldn't eat when McKenna left. Hadn't even dated for what 12 years. Livie hadn't even went out in public for 2 years since her loves death."
3,Frustrating Motivation,"I'm unsure how to feel about this book! It was full of so many up and downs, back and forths. The H&H;'s motivations were never clear for very long, as they'd change the next page. First of all, McKenna returning to ""get revenge"" 12 years later isn't a very psychologically sound reaction to being dumped. I suppose nowadays we'd just say ""let it go!"" :)I never saw any clear reason why Aline would fall for him--he was gruff, nasty, and surly almost the entire book. Then Aline's brother Marcus tries to ruin McKenna & Shaw's business, yet they pleasantly turn back up at his house, acting like nothing happened, doing business with him again.Aline kept going back and forth. She waits 12 years as a virgin because no one's as good as McKenna, yet when he pops back up, she keeps hiding from him, keeps her ""big secret"" (that didn't seem so insurmountable after all) from him. All in all, just a sort of confusing read."
4,Very good bowls for wire frame cages,"These are very good bowls that clip on very securely to myMidwest Cat Playpen. I have two of them in the playpen. They are deep enough to hold a good amount of food / water, and secure enough that I do not worry about spills or leaks. Very nice product."
4,Excellent and easy to transport,Bought these to use while traveling with our dogs and their crates - so easy to install / uninstall - so glad we purchased them!
1,"Great concept, but doesn't work","My hound dog recently decided that chewing on the spout of her Lixit water bottle was a good idea. I thought perhaps giving her a different method for obtaining water would be a better idea, so I purchased the Lanca 2 No Spill Cup. It attached very easily to the door portion of her large plastic crate, no problem at all. Day 1: When I got home from work the cup was no longer attached to the door, and the no spill lip had been removed as well. Day 2: When I got home from work not only was the cup no longer attached to the door, and the spill lip removed, but she had chewed on both parts. Obviously this poses a choking hazard. So to those fur baby parents that have chewers, this may not be the best product for you. It can be removed from the crate door way too easily."
1,I was dissappointed!,"This book was just plain bad. I had read Joan Johnston's books The Cowboy, and the Texan and loved them so I expected this book to be the same. It was very poorly written, and it seemed at times that a fourth grader wrote it. The two main characters were kissing each other before they had time to build chemistry together, and it was very choppy. This must have been one of Johnston's first books ever written. I usually do not talk badly of people's work because I know they work hard on writing these stories, but I felt I should warn people, Don't buy this book. SAVE YOUR MONEY!"
1,Shame shame shame!,"This is the worst SYBEX book I have ever purchased (out of 12). Yes I do believe I cought an ""occasional error"" it falls somewhere between page 1 and 786. The typos are embarrassing and too many to point out, was the editor on vacation when this was going to print. I only blame Lisa Donald and James Chellis, the authors, and WILL avoid their future books, sorry guys, your names are on the hard cover. I also do not appreciate the lack of authors emails or an email to send feedback to for the book. In closing can I get a refund? Very, very disapointed,"
2,doesn't even fit Norpro-branded half baking sheets,"these norpro mats are too big for their own baking sheets! i have two 12x18 sheets, and these mats are too big by about a half inch. i'm not a fan. i have to add more baking time, and the bottoms of my baked goods never seem to get as nicely crisp as when i use parchment paper.buyer beware!"
2,Not the best written book,We purchased this book a couple years ago and was surprised at some of the contradictions within the book itself. It appears that a lot of copy and pasting of prior article were implemented into the book and therefore was all over the place some of the times. I will not say you won't get anything out of the book but I will say it is not the best book for the buck. Do we use the book? Yes...do we own others...absolutely. Actually we have found the internet to be much more informative than this book. For the price I would avoid the book because there is now a lot more options out there then there has been in the past.
5,Great Children's CD,"I love this CD. We listen to Elizabeth Mitchell CDs to and from school each day. Elizabeth has an amazing voice and this is very kid friendly, my 10 month old daughter has started dancing and shaking a rattle to the songs."
5,Wonderful gift for children,"This beautiful CD is so wonderful for all ages. My 2 yr old granddaughter listens to it in the car, beautiful music, I just bought 3 more for friends with new grandchildren. I listen to it on the way to school and on the way home. It is very soothing and calming,"
5,You can't lose with E.M.,My son and I love her music; she has channeled the perfect sound for kids and parents looking for special moments together. We listen to this and all of her albums playlisted on WinAmp in the evening on repeat. I find myself letting it play on long after he's gone to bed.
5,Perfect for kids/adults alike...,We love this album! It has a fabulous folk sound and I enjoy it as well as the kids as the tunes are not condescending to children. The album consists of a variety of classics including a few from other cultures. Mitchell's voice is lovely and unpretentious. A perfect album to any children's collection.
1,Dont Buy this item.,I purchased this product few weeks ago after install it had been caused damage to my motherboard and CPU. I do not recommend it.
4,"Cleanse and Purify Thyself, Book One : The Cleanse",Great book! Everyone must read for a healthy lifestyle!
2,Beware of books that advertise,"I have been researching fasting, cleansing, and detoxification for a while now and ran across this book. From the site it sounded like the all exclusive answer to your cleansing questions... however, there is a huge flaw. It talks about two formulas to use in ""the cleanse"", and it doesn't give you those formulas... instead you have to go to the website that sells the products at a not so reasonable price. I was immediately disgusted with the fact that this is actually and book length ADVERTISEMENT, not a book. It may give you some great facts, but it is fluff for the sell of his products. Well, beware... there are much better books out there like Daniel Reid's ""Tao of Health, Sex and Longevity"" that cover the topic of cleansing and much more. Be wary of any book that withholds information for no good reason besides profit."
3,Be Careful!,"I had to send it back because the recovery process (on 2 CD's) did not work. The unit was unable to boot from the ""free"" CD/RW-DVD unit that comes with the laptop. Tech support was unable to get it to work either. Even though the ""free"" CD/RW-DVD seemed to work OK within Windows, when I first installed the unit through the USB port, I received a message that I was installing a high-speed device into a low speed port. The laptop is supposed to come with USB 2.0 ports, not 1.1.I am waiting to receive another complete unit. Hopefully the problem was with the ""free"" CD/RW-DVD and not with the laptop itself. Also, mine had at least one bad pixel. We will see how the other one works. Stay tuned for any updates!"
1,no customer support,"I have a MM10. Technical support is the worst I have encountered for any product. The people are horribly rude. My Hard drive crashed and the CD's supplied by sharp do not work. I checked with a few experts in the field and was told their is no cooling mechanism for the hard drive and it will crash because it overheats. Unless SHARP changes its attitude and offers better and reliable customer service, buying their products is only unnecessary anguish"
5,Coolest Computer Out There,"If you are looking for an sleek and cool looking computer this is it. If you don't need a desktop replacement, but are instead looking for a lightweight and thin computer that will turn heads buy the Actius MM10."
5,Just works!,"No problems, they run nice and quiet and cool. Working flawlessly. Don't know what the noise complaints are about! Used to cut both mine and my sons' hair!"
2,NO RESPONSE FROM COMPANY,"I am not happy at all with the company with whom I bought this from. I received the product and picked up the clippers and it is very heavy. I decided that I don't want it and wanted to return. Found out that since it not through Amazon that I had to contact the company with whom listed on here. I sent 2 emails asking them about their return policy and I NEVER heard back from them. Now the 30 days is up and it's mine. Thanks so much for nothing, BEAUTY4FAMILY. I will make sure that I never buy from that company again."
2,Too Much Self-indulgent Tripe,"There's some really good material in this book, but you have to plow through an awful--and I mean awful--load of self-indulgent tripe to find the occasional gem. When the chief authors aren't patting each other on the back and trashing the competition, they're staging made-up interviews with each other or writing about their dreams or other nonsense. The Montreal team essay is a rarity in that it looks in depth at something that actually happened on the field,an incident where a player loafed and cost the Expos a game and then was probably wisely traded. But there is just way too little of that. What there is instead is way too many stats that are difficult to understand or to read and too much from some writers who aren't all that impressive. Tom Austin is truly lame and his comments on what he thinks are the game's worst pitching seasons are sometimes almost laughable."
1,Just as weak as they say,"A big surprise to me to read these new ""reviews"". When I got this book last spring all of it's ""press"" was so good I was too embarassed to say how I felt. I don't think this book is very good at all. In fact it's very poor and boring, especially if it's your one baseball book like this you will buy. Next year I will choose something I have heard something about from people I can trust to know what they think. These new reviews are right. This book is a ripoff."
5,Truly great MGM masterpiece,"Excellent early 30's vechicle for Greta Garbo and Ramon Novarro. Both stars have never been better in both looks and performances. Lighting of the film is a real highlight and it's performances like this that make you wonder why the great Ramon Novarro didn't stay one of the greatest heartthrobs of 30's romances, he is sensational. Garbo as always is exotic, mysterious and totally captivating. Any real lover of Hollywood's glamour era when stars were real stars should purchase this video."
2,Difficult to finish,"I bought this book based on the reviews of others who had read it. I found it somewhat boring and the characters uninteresting. I usually like strong female characters, but not this one. I did not like the relationship that she had with her family and the surrounding story was uninteresting as well. I would not recommend this book and would only read another book by this author from the library!"
1,This software is extinct,"I bought this from a discount site, and boy was it a mistake. I was thinking it might be fun for my toddler to use since he likes to bang on the keys of my laptop so much. However, this is so dated, basically a bunch of cheap dancing clip art. If you have a smart phone, there is much better toddler-friendly software to be had for free. That they are charging $23+ dollars for this here is wishful thinking."
2,a below average book,"according to me,this is quite a ridiculous book.in this book,nancy is not allowed to enter the mapleton country club.so what does she do?she sneaks inside the club at 11 p.m. at night and also takes puppet,slave ned with her.talk about illegal!even if she wants to sneak inside in the night,why should poor ned do the same?otherwise it is quite an OKAY book,but not too worthwhile."
3,Mega Man,"it was ok, i thought it was more like super mario kind of game and was a little disappointed"
3,Pretty good book on debugging,"The book pretty much spends the whole time explaining the 9 rules (which are pretty darn good), but unless you want to spend a lot of time reading examples or don't understand the fairly basic concept of the rules (also available at www.debuggingrules.com) it seemed like there was a lot of filler in the book. Many of the war stories were entertaining, but somewhat repetitive. Also, most of the war stories are based on hardware issues and circuit design. As a software developer without much of a background in Electrical Engineering I had a hard time following many of them. Would have given the book an extra star if he mixed in more war stories related to software."
5,Invaluable resource for ANYONE!,"I am a computer animator and educator. I frequently reference this helpful guide. An easy short read and filled with great anecdotes to illustrate the underlying concepts. I find myself applying these rules to troubleshoot everything: hardware or software. I have used this to help me fix pool filtration systems, resolve car troubles, and sort out computer problems. I recommend this to all my students and to anyone who lives in this modern and complex world."
3,Caliban's mirror,"Houston: The Unknown City shows us a sepia picture of a city with a hidden presence in the Texas-Gulf Coast corridor, the nation and Latin America. Johnston gives a lot of information. Sadly, the writing tends towards geneologies in the style of the Book of Genesis and giddy recounts of old parties.What's interesting to me about Houston is not here: power, honor, corruption, cocaine, oil, medicine mixed with social graces, noblesse oblige and lucha libre. And cars.I think this book is most interesting to see how the Houston upper class sees themselves. Paraphrasing Wilde, the Houston dislike of realism is the rage of Caliban not seeing his own face in a glass, etc.The book's good for Houston socialites, people who are interested in Texas and Kitty Kelley. So, I suppose a kind of a compliment."
4,my review,"The book has lots of resourses for the dog lover to have handy, my only drawback is that the paper the book was printed on is almost like newsprint paper, very cheap and rips easily, I would suggest taking the book apart and putting the pages in page protectors and then into a binder"
1,They Don't Work!,These underarm shields literally fell off after only 10 minutes. I was never able to use them. Don't buy!!
5,Wonderful computer cartoons!,Buy this book if you are in the computer industry and you'll get real belly laughs! Rich Tennant did it again!
5,Yankee History in a Box,"This is a must for any Yankee fan, especially if you don't get the YES network. I do have it, so I've already seen most of these episodes, but I get impatient with all the commercials on the TV broadcasts. It's a real pleasure to watch these videos without all the commercial interruptions. They are also a wonderful way to introduce my 11 year old grandson (a huge baseball fan) to the Yankee greats of the past. There's no need to pay full price for this set though. Bargain prices abound, so be sure to look around for the best deal."
4,Great for most Yankee fans,"I have caught of the few episodes of Yankeeography of the YES network but wanted to see more. It's better without the commercials of course. The coverage is good, but perhaps updates at the end would have been a nice touch, like the passing of Bobby Murcer since the making of it. Overall I think it was well done in following the individual Yankee careers in less than an hour apiece. I may have elongated some things, like Lou Gehrig's ENTIRE speech, etc., but for the most part is great for most fans, except maybe the diehards, who aleady know this stuff and are looking for more."
1,Only a coulple of good songs.,"Not sure why almost all of the songs on this CD are very slow kind of lullabye songs. Very Boring. Kids don't want to relax with only slow songs! Not what I expected with such great, normally upbeat artists as contributors."
2,Not worth buying the whole album,"Some of the songs on this album are just self-indulgent for the artists and not really good songs. Instead of buying the whole album, I'd recommmend just buying the songs from Jack Johnson and the Indigo Girls. The Dave Matthews song was wholly disappointing as it was dark and possibly more self reflecting than entertaining for kids. The Bonnie Raitt song was good, but more for parents than kids."
3,Very interesting,"Very interesting book, since at the time I was really trying to learn about ascension, but some parts were very hard for me to understand. It is a great book for people that are really into this though."
5,Extraordinary tale,"I received this book as a gift and from the moment I picked it up, found it difficult to put down. It was a great read..well researched and well written. Mr. Worall has given us a hard look at an unforgettable character..a man with remarkable talents and drive..a masterful criminal whose rapid descent into evil is carefully unfolded... a glimpse of one of our greatest poets...a look at the seemy side of auction houses..great detective work...and a lot of interesting information on papers, pencils, and the art of forgery."
4,This book covers more than just one subject,"A well researched, carefully written book that covered much more than I expected. What did I learn? Mark Hoffman is possibly the smartest psychopath in history. Emily Dickinson remains as always a mystery, (perhaps this helps to explain our fascination with her), the Mormon church includes in it's development corruption and many inconsistencies, which is not so different from other world religions. Trusted names in the auction business cannot be trusted, and frequently, renowned experts in historical documents can't tell a fake from the real thing. In Emily's own words, ""A little madness in the spring, is wholesome even for the king...."""
2,Not engaging,Read the first 100 or so pages and couldn't stand to finish. Not an engaging read at all. I'm glad I got it free or I would have been even more disappointed.
3,Opportunity missed ..,"The premise linking a forged Dickinson poem, forged Mormon documents, and the forger enticed me to read this book.Parts of the book describing how forgeries are done and detected were very interesting. Alas however, there are no pictures of the forged documents that the author talks about. Thus you are left to your imagination when things such as ""the second loop in the S"" come up. Finally, I printed off samples of ""The Oathe(sic) Of a Freeman"", ""Salamander Letter"", and ""Anthon Transcripts"" from the web. Do this if you want to follow the descriptions in the book.Often the author states ""in pictures of Hoffman from the..."". But NONE of these pictures are in the book. This took a lot away from the quality of the work. Behind the book there are two pictures of Dickenson poems, one forged and one real. That's it.The writing is good in parts but somewhat disjointed as a flowing narrative.There is nothing new in regards to the forger, Mark Hoffman, and his Mormon forgaries."
2,Typos galore,Good read ruined by appalling typos. Words dropped from sentences. Bad editing. Very difficult to read when faced with these irritating and unnecessary errors.
2,Full of grammar errors.,"Fascinating story, full of grammar errors. Just when I was getting into the story, the authors grammar would ruin it."
5,Awesome book about Space history and Human Rights,The book contains many supporting documents that prove the point of the Author. The website pointed to Amazon for me to buy the book and it helped me make my decision for buying the book. The website is .... and has a reader survey seeking opinions of readers. Definitely worthwhile cause to give verbal support to help right a wrong.
3,Computer how to book,"This book has practically nothing on actual photograhy. It does has a tremendous amount of information on what to do with your pictures once you've taken them though. If you're looking for a book to improve the initial qaulity of your photos, this isn't it."
4,ddub,"Well thought out. Well constructed. Well, hell. This is a book worth reading and reading and reading and ..... you get the point. Whether you are an atheist or an atheist hater (the only two possibilities, yes?) you should read this book and leave your preconceptions at home with the pets, where they belong."
3,Not terribly interesting or informative...,"I picked this book up as a christian who is interested in maintaining a well-rounded viewpoint. I was hoping to encounter some interesting arguments or data to challenge specific points of the christian religion, but I can't say I really did. Ultimately, I feel like the author spent a lot of time dismissing Intelligent Design, which I can understand since it isn't hard science, but also ended up doing a lot of handwaving over his points of contention in general. Maybe I expected too much, I don't know. I think it's a worthwhile read since it's one of the highest ranking books on the subject, but that doesn't speak too well of the genre in general it seems. I appreciate the author's civil style and friendly tone, but ultimately I just wasn't persuaded to even reconsider anything, and that may make his attempt a failure."
5,"Deep, Deep Muffin Pan!","I love baking! This muffin pan is great for sconces, bigger muffins and giant cupcakes. I have made many cupcakes with this Wilton Muffin Pan and I just love the surprise when I present friends and family with jumbo chocolate, fruit and nut cupcakes. The responds is one of shock since everyone is used to small bitesized cupcakes. With this pan, no one is cheated out a big and delicious muffin, cupcake or sconces. Love this muffin pan and bakers will love it too!!!!"
5,Great weird drama,I was lucky to see this film when it toured the country last year. It is edgy and slick. Fine performaces by new names as well as a long time star: Karen Black. This show is not for the faint at heart . . . the freakiness creeps up on you and then bites hard several times. Very well made and an entertaining ride.
1,what the......?,"This is a rediculous movie. Terrible acting, combined with a poorly written screenplay makes for a long setting. The characters were developed so poorly, that even through the terrible abuses that were heaped upon them, I simply couldn't bring myself to care.The only saving grace of the film was the intensity of the color scenes.I only paid $1.65 for this movie and got it used... I still think I overpaid."
2,"Firecracker? More like ""Sparkler""","I can't believe some critic described this as ""the movie David Lynch wished he could still make."" Give me a break! It's more like the movie David Lynch is GLAD he never made. With a skilled director this could've been amazing, but the direction/editing is amateur at best. Some of the colors and shots are well done, Karen Black is great, Patton is convincing when he's playing the older brother...but the rest of the acting is horrible. It's never quite clear (whether it's due to directing &/or acting) whether Jimmy is half-retarded or just psychologically screwed up. The psycho Indian girl comes across as a cheesy Log Lady (Twin Peaks).Do yourself a favor & rent some David Lynch. This is a turkey!"
3,smaller than my hedgehog's cage,"I know everyone has commented about how small this thing is, but I didn't believe it.But you should!I just added picture of this with a mug in the middle to give you a better idea of the size before you buy it.Once I'm sure my hedgehog can't climb out of it, I will probably buy another one and link them together. It seems like you can link them together and double the floor space."
3,Product Features are all wrong,"I ordered this because it said it was for ""ferrets, rabbits and guinea pigs"". It is NOT. It also says the panels are 55 inches long, they are NOT. They are 5 1/5 inches long - BIG difference.It is also NOT 24 feet wide, it is 24 INCHES wide.Someone wasn't paying attention. Guinea Pigs are WAY bigger than hamsters. This thing is smaller than my GP's cage... not very useful as a playpen.I notified the company horseloverz and they are supposed to make changes. I'm sure this is fine for a hamster (as the box states - hampsters and gerbils) so if you have hamsters, go for it. Do not get this for a ferret, rabbit or guinea pig."
2,My Hamster Escaped from this!,"This is advertised as an add on to your cage. It even has a place for a connector tube. I do not recommend this item unless you plan on using it only under close supervision and NOT attached to a cage. My daughter's dwarf hamster escaped. I think he climbed out over the top by hoisting himself up on the purple connector square. In any case, he's gone and is no where to be found. My daughter is very upset and so am I. Be very wary of this product. It is well made but not to be used as an add on to the cage, no matter what the box says!"
3,Fun to scale,"I bought this for my daughters dwarf hamsters and it took about 3 seconds for one of them to scale the side and go over the top. It's a great idea, but creates a false sense of security for the kids. It's going back."
2,not tall enough,We have a hamster that loves to climb. He figured out how to climb over the top in 5 minutes. It was a waste of money for him. Our other hamster who is very mellow it works fine. So depends on the nature of the hamster to wether this is useful or not.
2,Not as good as I thought,"My hamster climbs out of this playpen in 5 seconds, and he completely destroyed the mat. The mat is very very thin and doesn't do any good. I tried putting a top on the fence, but he still got out. I suggest getting something different for a hamster."
2,Does not work according to specs.,"When not on timer, it will turn the lamp on before dusk and sometimes early mornings when there is plenty of natural light coming in. By using the timer feature of 6 hours, it will either not turn on or turn off before the 6 hours."
1,"Good Range, Too Many False K Alerts, Detector Lasted 2 Weeks.","This radar dectector stopped working right after 2 weeks of use. The K & KA bands would go off non-stop, back and forth between half and full bars as soon as I powered the thing on. I'd unplug & plug back in the detector, shut it down for a while, turned off settings, but nothing seemed to work. I called Beltronics and they asked me where I bought it from. As soon as I said Amazon, the guy on the phone got rude, said Amazon was not a authorized seller, the problem sounded like a faulty antennea, and they wouldn't honor the warranty. If I wanted it fixed it would cost me a minimum of $65.00 plus shipping. He said that for all he knows, the detector could be stolen and repackaged. Amazon, Ebay, etc. are not authorized sellers of their products. Also, trying to get ahold of the seller isn't that easy either. (I won't name the seller unless I get taken for a ride.)Beltronics Vector 995 Radar and Laser Detector"
3,Speeding ticket,"We got a speeding ticket the first time out with this product! Not sure any detector could have save us, The cop was hiding just over the crest of a steep hill. By the time i crested the hill and the alarm went off he had me!"
5,Another great product from Beltronics,I replaced an older Bel detector with the V995 and they have made great improvements over the older model. Does a great job even catching radar over the crest of hills. Very few false alarms except you get a few in town but that is to be expected. Easy to use and mount and the price from Amazon is the best.
3,a mile and under,"I was a little disappointed with my first trip with the Vector 995. The best warning I got was a 1.2 miles before I was on the police radar patrol.I travaled through Mich, Ohio, Ky, and Tenn. Bel will not honor its warranty if you buy with a Amazon dealers so I recommend you buy the protection plan or buy it from Bel. The online reports that I have gotten is up to 2 miles is a good detector!"
1,Little Cloud Is NOT A Good Book,"I'm sorry, I just think that this book goes too far. This book does not promote ethically conscious responses to adversity. What does it teach children? ""Hey if someone is bullying you, violence should be your first response. No, more than that, permanently disfiguring violence should be your first response.""And don't get me wrong: I am all for violent responses to bullying and in response to things like genocide...in fact, I'm ready to kill people myself if I have to in order to save victims of horrific crimes against humanity, but small children aren't fighting our wars, and small children have more options on the playgrounds and in schools than resorting to violence straightaway. So we don't need to indoctrinate them with an ethic of violence before they are mentally and emotionally able to handle such notions."
4,TMNT collection is great!,"I would recommend this to anyone who grew up with the TMNT. Only ""complaint"" (not really, but not sure what else to call it) would be that there is on season on two not sequential discs. Oh, well. Still great having the original turtles all in one collection!"
5,my neice and i love it,reminds me of my childhood. really happy with the product. but i still wish they would release it on blu-ray
1,for God so Loved...,"Music is a powerful element. Like fire or water out of control, it can destroy all in it's path.While I don't dislike 5%ers, I find it appealing that this album provides a 90 page document to ""educate"". Seems that if listeners become addicted to this 'music', the messages to the subconscious will be the real catalysts in the recruitment of 'new converts'. Know what you are getting into before you do it.We have only one command, and that is to love one another."
2,lame,"lid doesn't actually fit snugly as others have said, but its also a cheap, thick plastic that doesn't really do much to help in viewing things."
5,a good book at a great price,"It got here fast, well packed and as advertised. I was suprised to find out it was a libray book. It is in great shape. No tears or folded pages, No smudges or finger prints on the the phots inside. Very informative on The N&W railroad, also on how the photographs were taken. A great book if you are modeling the N&W in any scale."
5,Everything that I expected,I enjoy this product and the delivery was quick and efficient. Be sure that everyone around you is fine and don't need anything else because you won't be able to hear much of what is going on around you with these on. Cheap and affordable and great for personal use.
3,Sound is not good. Get the Sony V6 instead.,"These and the sonys are uncomparable, trust me. I was amazed when I discovered that the sonys which I payd $50 for had the same sound as my Grado 325i that costed $300. Actually the sonys have deeper bass (lower frequency) and have other advantages. The sound of the Grado and the sony is very very similar, despite the fact that the Grados are open headphones and the sonys are closed.Get the sony V6 for an incredible sound that is the best advice, and it costs you nothing!"
1,A Big Disappointment,"The reviews were so good on these earphones and the price was incredible, so I thought I'd try them. Just awful! The bass was so loud, it drowned out everything else. The ear cups are huge, and they hurt the top of my head. I guess you get what you pay for!"
2,"Too much bass.. good for movies & hip hop musci, not instrumental","I first bought a cheapo JVC Harx300 and find it has too much bass (I should have read ""extra bass"").I then bought the Audio Technica M150 based on 5 star reviews.I find that Headphone reviews are the most subjective to me.There is simply too much bass from both headphones (or many headphones in the market),.. I play bass guitar and do not know which instrument can give off so much bass.These are more suited for watching movies with rumbling effects.Maybe it's what the general public wants - but in no way does it represent sound coming off real musical instruments."
3,Very uncomfortable if you have big ears,"These headphones are VERY uncomfortable if you have big ears. There is not much space for your ear, and on top of that the speaker parts rotate so they 'perfectly fit', meaning if you have big ears ALL of the force is on your ear itself. If you have small/normal sized ears they probably are really nice though.The sound quality was just ok. Too much bass and it's not very well defined imo, like they turned up the bass just so they could claim '12 hz' or whatever extreme. It does also a good job of keeping room noise out."
4,Awesome for the Price,"Just got these headphones today and I'm really liking them.Pros:Very ComfortableCHEAPLook niceGood soundLong CordCons:The bass sounds odd, sounds hollow."
4,Awesome just wish they were a little louder,"These are sooo great for the price. very comfortable, lots of bass, pretty clear. only down side is they don't play that loud. my original apple earphones are louder but its loud enough."
2,Very Uncomfortable for people with almost no hair,"Pros:-Good sound-Isolates most soundsCons:-UNCOMFORTABLE AS HELL (if you have short hair or are bald, like me :P)-HeavyIf you have a lot of hair, it's ok. But if don't, be careful."
1,cheap product,"I purchased these a month ago, and just used them for the first time today. I plugged them into my computer, only one side worked. I thought maybe it might be my computer jack, so i plugged it into my zune. Same thing happened. Not only did one side not function, but if i moved the cord in any way, the sound would come in and out. These were cheap, in cost and in function."
5,Great set at a great price.,I've ordered 3 since 2011. My first set is still working and in good condition. The other 2 were for my brother who keeps breaking them while sleeping. lol. So don't buy these if you plan on using them while sleeping. Tossing and turning will only break them and render them useless. Use those ear bud sets when you want to sleep to your music. Not this.
3,you get what you pay for,"Bought this after reading reviews claiming this is ""the best"" headphone. Also bought Sennheiser eH150 ($30) and Sony MDR-XD200 ($22.39). My comparison:* Sennheiser eH150 has the best sound quality!* Sennheiser eH150 is too tight. You can probably bend it to make it loose, but don't last long* Sony MDR-XD200 sounds somewhat better that JVC* JVC looks kind of cheap. But you can't beat the price ($17 including shipping) for what you get..."
3,The 5 buck bang,I ended up picking this up for five bucks when they dropped the price on em. So i got a pair. Not bad for that price or even for 15 MAYBE 20 bucks. Sounds pretty good everywhere but the best quality sound comes from the reciever when you use the jack adapter that comes with it. For the 5 bones i got em for is a no brainer.
2,Just OK,These don't sound great nor are they comfortable. The round cup is big yet somehow annoys the ears. Maybe it needs more padding. The real pain is at the top of the head where it creates a pressure point on the skull. Yes they were only $13 but I should have spent more on something more comfortable.
4,Good sound,"The headphones sounds good, I use them the listen to the TV at nightok fit, more comfortable than others I have usedseems to be good qualityWas delivered on timeThanks"
3,Just ok...,"Comfort 5 stars,sound quality 2or3 stars, durability ,so far so good,aren't very loud, with iPod ,could be volume settings, but was expecting better sound from JVC, because of past experiences."
3,"Decent, low bass though","It is okay, but the only problem I have with it is that the bass sound is to low, and the headphone cannot adjust or change it. My ipod can't either, but my ipod was never the problem because my old headphone played it well. Basically, the bass is low for every song I hear. Also, the wire is so long, but I tied it up so that is not a big problem. Overall it is decent. Hopefully the one you get sounds right."
2,I returned the camera...,"I bought this camera shortly before Thanksgiving after dropping my HP digital camera and broke it. I chose this Sony camera for the 12x optical zoom and I thought it would take nice photos of my 9 month old son. I ended up returning the camera back to the store I purchased since the flash took long to charge. Every photo of my son had him looking like a dear in headlights (since the red pre-flash light caught him off guard) and/or he was already crawling away and I missed the ""kodak moment"" since the camera wasn't ready. I literally took hundreds of photos to get one of him smiling, when with my old camera I could get one good photo quickly. The camera would be great for still photos or when a flash is not needed. I'm not the best with all the manual overrides the camera offered, so I guess for a ""point and click"" kind of person, this wasn't the best camera for me."
2,Sony's planned obsolescence,"Liked this camera quite a bit for the first year or so, but then thigns started going sour.First the ability to freeze the focus by half-pushing the shutter release button stopped working. It turns out that this is due to a dimple that the shutter button puts into the micro switch, over time and usage. Very poor design.But fine, I could live with it.But then one day the whole shutter button broke and came off entirely. If you search online for ""DSC-H2 Shutter release button"" you will find hundreds of people with this same problem.Sony wanted $180+ to fix it. Instead, I managed to order the parts for $20, and hope I'll be able to fix it myself, or this thing is done for.Disappointed in this camera, and disappointed in Sony for not admitting this is a faulty product with a design flaw, and covering its repair."
2,Great camera until the button broke,"There have been a few reviews about the hardware quality of Sony products. I suggest you thoroughly research the various issues mentioned. I was generally pleased with this camera until the shutter button broke...it just fell off. This happend 3 days after the warrenty expired. Due to the high cost of repair, I will just buy a new non-Sony camera."
3,Good Pictures but.....,"I enjoyed this camera for about 3.5 years until the shutter button popped off. I was on Vacation in Cancun on a tour, got off the bus to take pictures of the ocean and when I went to take pictures later on the tour, I couldn't no shutter button. I bought the replacement and it still falls off. Sony did not stand behind this flaw. So I'm eery of Sony cameras and their policy to stand behind their product.Have a Blessed day.Merry Christmas"
4,Great Glasses,"I bought these glasses about a year ago, when I was shopping for stuff for my first apartment. They are wonderful! They are really durable and a great color! They are also great if you do not have a dishwasher. In my tiny apartment, there isn't any room for one, so I have to handwash all my glasses. They are really easy to clean. I can easily get my hand and sponge inside to wash them out."
2,great at first,"My husband and I registered for these glasses when we got married and loved them at first. They looked great and were easy to clean and drink out of. However, shortly after, they begin to chip and break. Now a year and a half later we maybe have 4 left. Buyer beware!!!!"
5,Cobalt blue vs. deep blue,"These glasses look great, are a good size, and feel good in the hand. My only complaint is that the color is a real COBALT (which is quite purple) instead of the blue which is shown on-line and on the actual box, but this is probably great for all of you who decorate with cobalt."
3,If it wasn't delivered broken.....,"I would have enjoyed my glasses more. When I picked up the box I heard nothing but shattered glass. I passed the deadline for a return so I hesitated to open the box and found that only 1 had broken, so it wasn't so bad. Besides that I love the color of them. They are really nice!!!"
4,Stunning!,"Marian Gold has a beautiful voice and a phenomenal range. This is the album from which ""Cosmopolitician"" originates. A marvelous piece of work and a must-have for any Alphaville fan. I give it four stars because I think Marian Gold's other solo album, ""So Long Celeste,"" is a tad better. Unfortunately ""Celeste"" has yet to be released in the States, and is in fact out of print."
1,Nothing special...,"I was not impressed in the least by Gandhi's Way. Mark Juergensmeyer does a good job summing up Gandhi's thoughts, but they are not anything special. The solutions to the problems created by the author are not solutions that would work in real-life conflicts and many of his ideas conflict with each other. The conflict resolutions that are good ideas (along with those that aren't) are nothing special or spiritual at all. It's absurd to pretend that considering another option is something spiritual. Don't waste your time reading this book; anything it suggests you could have thought of on your own... in a quarter of the time."
5,Kevin Kent's Nanking is Mesmerizing,"I couldn't put this book down. Kevin Kent has written a tribute to an American herione who saved 10,000 lives during the siege of Nanking. His fictionalization of the storyline seems plausible. He intertwines fiction with fact beautifully. I highly recommend this as a satisfyingly good read."
5,The most overrated Pokemon game EVER!,"This is such a fun game! The reviews don't say anything about this game.First off,you take a test to see what Pokemon you are like. Then you get a partner that suits you perfectly. Together, you get other Pokemon to join your team and complete missions!This is such an overrated game and you should get it."
3,Don't buy RED.,"My son has a Nintendo DS but wanted the Red version of this game. We have the blue version as well but they DO NOT interface well. Nintendo is embracing WiFi and leaving the SP series behind. Blue rescue team is fun for a couple weeks, then gets boring as there isn't the depth of prevous games (Blue, Green, Ruby, Emerald, etc.). No breeding, no ""shiny"" pokemon, no real depth. Ranger doesn't seem to be so great too. Wait for Diamon and Perl which should introduce >100 more pokemon and work nicely with the wireless croud. If you don't have one, its going to be the reason to buy a DS."
3,liking pokemon,This game was bought for my 4 yr old nephew. He really enjoys this game. What helps is my sons were into pokemon also and they help him a great deal. My nephew thinks he is the bomb because he has a game system like the older boys. I am glad they keep the older versions so that others can buy. We don't buy the newer version of systems for the younger ones. We just pass them down from the older kids as they get new ones so the younger ones don't feel left out. He has had great fun with the games that we order him. I am hoping to find other games he may like.
4,Well Liked!,I purchased this game for my daughter. She requested it as a reward from Handipoints (the chore website). She really likes this game.
4,I Thought This Game Was Good But...,"I like this game because you actually get to play as a Pokemon. But in reality, though, I am more anxious for Pokemon Diamond and Pearl instead. This game was fun, no offense, but I like games where you get the freedom to move around. Pokemon Dungeon hardly lets you move around alot. I also miss the feature where you get to save no matter where you are at. That's another reason why I want Pokemon Diamond or Pearl. You could be in the middle of nowhere and you would still get to save. I like the personality test at the beginning, though. Another feature I miss is pressing the START button to open your menus to select items and things like that. This game does not let you do that, you have to press the B button instead, and that's kind of hard for when you're in a hurry."
5,Great buy!,"This set is one you should definitely buy! I like the look, and also was impressed with the quality."
3,Not Boring,"This work is not just about construction. It has distinct chapters, including welding by sound, underwater welding, and welding by robots. This may be a good tool for shop classes or some science classes. Boys and tomboys who want to become architects or engineers may love it.The work shows exciting 3-D graphics. It provides spellings and definitions for terms that will expand your vocabulary.There is only one woman interviewed here and no people of color are interviewed. Thus, it is not a diverse work. Still, welding may sound boring, but this program was pretty entertaining and informative."
5,Best puzzles available,"All of the Melissa and Doug puzzles are the highest quality puzzles I've ever seen. My son, now 4, has LOVED puzzles since he was just a year old and these have always been our choice. They stand up to his rough and tumble way of playing and I have even accidentally stepped on them many times when he forgets to put them away and they've never broke or even cracked. LOVE these puzzles and will continue to buy them. Although I think the 48 piece puzzles may be better for younger children. My son still enjoys them but after two times he is now able to put it together REALLY fast. I think it's time to move up to something bigger..."
4,Gift for Great Nephew,"I purchased this as a birthday gift for my great-nephew. It was well made, fast delivery and I think he is enjoying playing with it."
1,Not quite up to expectations,"My 4 year old son got this puzzle and another M&D puzzle last week for his birthday. The graphics are wonderful, but that's all the good things I can say about them. The pictures are already starting to come off of the pieces, the pieces are really hard to get apart, and there are wood fragments coming off this puzzle like crazy. The ends of the pieces are sharp and it gives me the willies to touch them because of the wood shards that are sticking out of the pieces and board. I would have a cardboard puzzle over these any day."
2,Disappointed,"My daughter loves this puzzle and the colors and picture are visually very appealing, but we've only put it together maybe 4 times and the wood is splintering and the picture is peeling off. It's very disappointing and nothing like our experience with other Melissa and Doug products."
1,frustrated by the poor quality!!!,"I agree with prevous reviews expressing frustration re: poor quality of this product. Normally we love Melissa & Doug wooden puzzles but this one is made of thin wood, pieces and pictures breaking off, and the worst... too many pieces easily fit into the wrong places!! Very frustrated every time we've used it - going for donation now."
5,This Brush is PERFECTION on Weaves,I just started weaving my hair and my normal hair brushes just were NOT cutting it. This brush untangles the hair with minimum effort. I love this brush - couldn't live without it!
5,Greeley at his best!,"I love Andrew Greeley. As with many of his readers, my Catholic faith was, from time to time, a tad wobbly. However, Andrew Greeley reminds me of why I am a Catholic and makes me happy about it."
5,Captures True Duprees Sound,"We see many Duprees concerts a year and this CD truly showcases what they do best- keep this fabulous music alive!!! We play this music in between the concerts to satisfy our need for their great harmony and stage presence. Not only are the four singers capable, their band is wonderful, truly great! Highly recommend this cd as well as their Live At The Sands Volume 1."
4,Excellent Heuristic Overview of Computing,"The text is written well, simple and not boring. The idea of building a computer from nand gates to a running an application on an OS is an epic challenge. It isn't enough to just read the principles, but you need to use them. That's where the beauty of the whole package is."
4,A Tidy Synopsis of a omputer System,"This book, and the course on which it's based,covered double the information, in about half of the time, as my senior-level Operating Systems college class. Of course, I took the class twenty years ago, but that just goes to show how much better organized, and knowledgeable the industry has become in that time."
4,Looks good,I think I will have to give up my day job to engage in this project. I got through the first chapter. It took a lot of effort to figure out stuff like 'put the information into the simulator' without telling you how. The authors have written for PC so getting things to happen on an iMac all takes time. I want to do it and I probably will. The time or possibly my wife is going to kill me.
4,"a little scary, but a very good movie","Another marvel Hero is adapted in a T.V.movie. Doctor Strange is less popular than Spider-Man, Hulk and Captain America but if you are a comic books fan, you have to see this movie specialy if you are a live-action super-heroes collector. Like all others T.V. super-Heroes (Hulk, Spider-Man, Captain America), the origin is very different from the comic books. In this movie, Dr Strange is a psychiatrist(in the comic-books, he's a surgeon). In years, i did not see this movie at tv and there is no chance to see this movie at t.v. The only chance to see this movie is to buy it, and do it fast before this movie becomes unavailable. I do not recommend it for children under 10, because there are some scary scenes. Why they did not do a second movie or a regular series ? It would have been interesting. I heard a few years ago there was suppose to have a big budget movie."
1,Average movie,"Well I don't know too much about the comic's origin but I'am willing to bet it's ten times better. This movie allegedly a shot for a tv series suffers from absolutey no story to cheap to zero special effects, and no action.Peter Hooten as Stephen Strange is ok but nothing special. The story with Lindmer and evil Morgan LeFay and takeover of Earth is easy to follow but really there is no budget or great special effects to elevate the movie to the comic book level it needs to be interesting to the audience.The first fourty minutes are nothing more than wishy washy soap opera stuff until Strange meets Lymer but even then as mentioned when Strange does battle with Lefay there are little effects to make it worthwhile until the last half of the movie. I will say it does become more enjoyable near the end as finally we see a couple of visuals in play. ""Dr. Strange"" is a pretty average flick but comic lovers should like it.;"
5,Excellent book for radiology residents and medical physicist,This book provides a highly readable and a comprehensive review of the basic physics and current technology for the diagnostic imaging modalities in radiology and nuclear medicine. Its thorough up-to-date coverage of all imaging modalities combined with an extremely well organized layout for introducing the various topics makes the text especially useful for radiology residents preparing for the ABR examination. The level of detail covered makes the book an essential reference volume for medical physics graduate students and medical physicists as well. All topics are covered in sufficient detail and depth to make it an extremely useful one to select for the primary text for the physics course on diagnostic imaging for radiology residents as well as the introductory course on the same topic for graduate students in medical physics.
1,"If you want to feel your eyes bleed, buy this video NOW","There was some slight excitement among NIMH fans when they heard that a sequel to the beloved Secret of NIMH would be coming out. Unfortunately, the movie was not made for them at all; it's barely even a continuation of the original. The only reason it was ever made was that MGM wanted to take a well-known name in animated film and capitalize off of it, nothing more. The target audience is little 6-year-olds too young to have seen the original, and who have a taste for bright animation and a total lack of quality.Any true fan of NIMH will only feel disappointed after watching this; they'd be better off watching Saturday morning cartoons. In closing, I can offer no advice better than this: buy the original, and the book it was based on, too. You'll be a lot better off in the end that way."
5,Still Woman Enough,"This is my first time trying to write a review, but I though it was necessary to let you know how I felt about this book. I really though it was well written and I really enjoy the way she wrote it. She really wrote from her heart and very brave to let everyone know her life. I think everyone should read this book even if your not a fan.Thanks for letting me tell you about this book.."
4,Faute du meilleur,"I bought this because it was in the shop, whereas the one I wanted, McFedries' Idiot's Guide was not: I already had his Windows 98 book, which I had found invaluable. ""For Dummies"" often failed to answer my questions, but McFerdies nearly always did answer them."
3,Its not a teaching book.,The book for the most part is having a discussion with you about Windows XP. Offering comments or critiques. It is not a book that I would recommend for learning via book. A Few areas actually go into depth. I see it as a PowerPoint presentation discussion about basics XP and should have been sold as. It lacked detail in networking and wireless needed for many user/owner issues.
4,WINDOWS XP FOR DUMMIES,"HAD BOUGHT WINDOWS XP TO UPGRADE MY WIN 98 AND FOUND THAT THERE WAS ENOUGH OF A DIFFERENCE THAT I NEEDED A LITTLE EXTRA HELP. I JUST STARTED USING COMPUTERS AGAIN AFTER BEING AWAY FOR 13 YEARS AND THEY HAVE REALLY CHANGED. I HAD TO UPGRADE BECAUSE ALL THE NEWW EQUIPMENT THAT I BOUGHT HAD TO HAVE XP, 2000, OR BETTER TO RUN. THIS BOOK HAS THE HINTS THAT I NEED TO GET ME FROM STUCK TO UN-STUCK IN A SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME. TOO MANY OTHER BOOKS ARE TOO TECHNICAL FOR THE AVERAGE JOE TO UNDERSTAND."
4,INFORMATIVE BOOK,"The book, on the whole, does as its title asserts - uses good photographic images to show the reader the various shapes used by Wedgwood. It also offers some guidance as to the rarity of colors used and a basic historical reference.Even with the wide variety of shapes shown, there were some missing. The identification of the designs was most informative."
1,The Mirror Crack'd,"The bad review is for the movie itself, which is really awful. All those stars deserved better. However, the DVD arrived timely and in great condition, so no complaints about the seller."
2,A disappointment.,"This book was saved from 1 star by its many examples - including modern ones like stability analysis of the ALOHA protocol. Other than that, there is nothing in this book that is not better presented elsewhere. Instead of developing the readers intuition this book immediately assaults the reader with rigor and notation. Key concepts are completely unmotivated or so hopelessly muddled that the reader is left wondering where a particular line of reasoning is going or why it is important. There are numerous typographical errors and the typesetting is difficult to tolerate, especially for the long periods of time it will invariably take to get through this tome. Much of the material in this book is better covered in the standard random processes book of Karlin and the second volume of Feller."
5,Virtual Amp On A Budget,"Stadium sounds without the road crew needed to tote stacks of speakers.Play it through your amp, or plug it into your computer. Considering the forty stomp boxes you'd need to get the preset sounds,that's already a $[...] savings.Eleven amp models. That's a $[...] savings.An electronic tuner and a drum machine. That's another $[...] savings.Makes even an inexpensive guitar sound great.Put an Audacity program on your computer and lay down multiple tracks.And only $[...] bucks.DigiTech RP50 Guitar Multi Effects Pedal"
2,Too late,I wanted this product delivered for Christmas but it was out of stock.Ended up going to the local music shop where I picked up an even more impressive model for almost the same money!
3,Solid title for DS,"I've been a Resident Evil fan from the begining of time, so it is safe to say that I played every game under the title (or at best most of them). Resident Evil DS is a solid game to have for fans of the title. Of course you have to take into consideration that it won't be as graphically impressive as it is on other video game consoles, but it has similar game play and brain teasers that made Resident Evil popular. Overall I'm pleased with the game, and I hope there is more to come in the future."
1,"Bye, CA","I've used and upgraded CA products for years without trouble. Easy to use, operated quietly in the background. Solid.After installing the 2007 version according to the instructions, this upgrade proved to be nothing BUT trouble. Made several software programs function irratically or not at all. Made Windows XP thoroughly unstable, never previously an issue on my system. A disappointment for sure.Rather than 'argue' with Security Suite 2007, I gave in and bought different software."
2,not recommended,"Trying to install this software (the three license version) on two separate computers (XP Pro/XP Home) has left a bad taste in my mouth.The update feature has so far been a crap-shoot (with pretty bad odds of success). In my 10 or so attempts, I've seen the update feature complete successfully only once. At other times the update feature ended up hanging while checking for updates or after completing the downloads, or simply reported a failure to install packages. This is over a DSL connection with plenty bandwidth.The application at times behaves erratically, with the control center showing up slow, only partially, or not at all. Sometimes a reboot helps, sometimes it doesn't. As a separate issue, attempts to delete messages using my yahoo web mail account with the firewall enabled have failed.Of the packages that I have tried recently (McAfee, Norton, CA) this has been the worst installation experience. It seems to be working now, but my level of confidence in this product is low."
2,Still holding on...,"Fresh from the meatgrinders at Epitaph Records is the band Pulley. They have finally put out a release as gaudy as the mid-seventies Ford Van on the cover of their album. The harmonies of the album are well orchestrated, despite the predictable progressions that many pop-punk bands have been moving towards on the West Coast. Lighthearted and upbeat, the album lacks any real technical depth save for their energetic attitudes. The very self-explanatory ""Huber Breeze"" reminds me of a good type of beer in the midwest, and for that I am very thankful; the album goes well with a six-pack. Pulley is Scott Radinsky on Vox, Mike Harder and Jim Blowers on Guitar, Tyler Rebbe on bass and Tony Palermo on Drums. Visit the band on the web at www.x-members.com."
5,Love it,This is my favorite version of Miracle on 34th Street. I watch it from Thanks Giving on through the new year.
5,Miracle on 34th Street (Special Edition),"Beloved Edmund Gwenn, a secondary but deluxe actor. In Spain he acted in a film of the years 50's titled 'Calabuch' whose work in it was very appreciated."
4,Beasts in my Bed,"For those who are true Durrell fans, Jacquie's viewpoint helps round out the overall picture. However, she is not quite the writer Gerald is. The best parts of the book are Gerald's footnotes scattered throughout the book. Since I am collecting all Durrell's books, this made a good addition. Would be a good book for any woman getting involved with a wildlife expert."
2,CAREFUL!,This feeder is only for large aquariums with lots of fish because the smallest amount of food dumped in the water is great (for about 15 big fish at least !!!!)
4,Great Book Hits the Target,"This was a very timely book for me. I have been dealing with two Narcissistic people for quite a few years and I just was getting frustrated with trying to figure out the roller coaster ride that I seemed to be on weekly--envy, resentment, praise, anger all came into play. The book helped me to sort this out and in a way that I am now working on applying the straight forward strategies. I have recommended this book to my graduate social work interns, particularily the section on Narcissists in the work place--abuse of power. But really this is a great book for everyone who is concerned about raising insightful children and making the world a better place to live. I highly recommend it."
4,You Can Read the Book,"but it won't change anything about your narcisstic mate. Go ahead and read all about it, but he/she won't change because he/she thinks the world of himself, and sees no reason to adapt himself to anyone else's world."
5,"EXCELLENT book, especially for anyone going into Social Work","This book was excellent. Informative, well-organized, easy to read, and thorough in it's presentation of Narcissicism at various levels, including narcissisim in teens, the elderly, parents, and in the work place. It also discusses societal implications and how the U.S. perpetuates narcissistic qualities. I highly recommend this book for anyone going into the social work field, particularly those who specialize in addiction. This book will not only help you to recognize the signs of Narcissistic Personality Disorder in clients, but it will give you the tools needed to cope with narcissistic behavior in your personal life. Highly recommend."
2,Too Technical,"""Why is it Always About You?"" starts off being quite helpful but then falls into the ""why did I start this"" catagory. The book becomes very technical after the first couple of chapters and the jargon becomes disruptive to the non-professional reader's apprection of the subject.I didn't finish it and am now looking for something in a more ""reader friendly"" format. Big dissappointment."
1,Harsh,"I haven't completed this book but I can't give it a thumbs up. From growing up with nacissistic parents, I often wonder if I have the traits as well. The author is a bit harsh in the way she describes certain tendencies. For instance, on pg. 13- ""Those who are less successful at developing a talent or skill may rely on petty games of oneupmanship to sustain a sense of superiority. These are among the name-droppers, status seekers, and know it alls of the world..."" I agree with these statements but think she could write in a less shame producing manner in the event you may have some of these tendencies. I believe you want to walk with people on their journey versus hammering out the unwanted characteristics. She is the hammering type sadly. I recommend the book Children of the Self Absorbed.Children of the Self-absorbed: A Grown-up's Guide to Getting over Narcissistic Parents"
5,Fabulous!,This was a wonderful book to help sort out and validate my impressions. It also gave good advice for handling difficult people and relationships.
5,Outstanding Survival Story,"This is my first Meg O'Brien book and I must say I really enjoyed it. I loved the story line and the fact that it was written in first person past and present. I also enjoyed the characters and their colorful personalities. The story was very suspenseful and full of surprises. You will keep going back and forth on ""who did it."" And you will be surprised at the end. I highly recommend this to anyone who likes suspense."
5,"Cute, fitted jersey for the devout baseball fan!",Great to wear to games or even as on overshirt on a warm summery day. Cute and nicely fitted to show off those curves.
1,Give me the good old days,I would give this a 0 star rating. After using it for a little more than a year vertical lines have appeared on the sides. They line up with where the screen is set for a standard screen. If I set the picture size to Full or Zoom they will go away in a couple of weeks. Now the TV is turning off. There does not seem to be any rhyme or reason for it. Sometimes it happens after a couple of minutes sometimes it takes hours. I bought this set when it first came out and it cost me around $1000.00. I took the TV it replaced and put it in my basement office and it is still going strong at 20 years old. Just think what this will do to your wallet as well as the environment if all these TVs only last a few years. I will never consider buying another Westinghouse product.
5,Excellent old fashioned Britsh comedy,Excellent old fashioned knee slapping hilarious British comedyI couldnt stop laughing
1,Yesterday's hero,"once midnight oil were held in high estemm by those with a social and environmental conscience, alas that was many years ago. Since singer Peter Garrett joined the conservative Australian Labor party, and was elected into Federal government back in 2004, their once powerful lyrics have been reduced to cliched sloganeering. Garrett's enviro-credibility has been left wanting, and his once stringent anti-nuclear stance has been compromised with his membership of the ALP, whose leader is pro-nuke.Garrett's current stance opens for debate as to how serious he ever was concerning the pivotal issues of our times.give this one a miss - if you have the oils in your collection, you've got enough. nowadays my passion for the oils has incurred head injuries as i recall their long abandoned anthems."
2,Meh,I have to say that I didn't feel this upgraded DVD was so superior to the original to justify the expense/ duplication in my collection. Won't buy any other rereleases unless I see ecstatic reviews.
1,garbage,"One of the lamest, most boring, dreary, plotless pilesof shallow trash ever to insult the name of Dr.Who. Give methe Peter Davsion era anyday,or the Pertwee era for that matter.Heck, Hartnell was better than this! This is up there with theSensorites for boring ""so what"" value. It's pap! What's more the superficial mish mash of time travelers who decide to dress up as The Phantom of the Opera and Fu Manchu for no apparent reason are only moderately less pointless and silly that the totally out of character Doctor who has decided to dress up as Sherlock Holmes and start babbling about ""elementary"" etc, like he's swallowed the complete works of Conana Doyle. I suppose if Tom Baker had put on a dress and started acting like Miss Marple, that also would have been acceptable? This just looks a bit less stupid, but scrape away the ""style"" and the substance is just as rank!"
1,this stinks!,what the heck this thing broke off the 1st day i played with it it ws dumb and had no point... budda would be dissapointed.
5,Our collective conscience would rather disbelieve,"The book is well written with meticulous citations. The author makes his points aggressively and with a degree of anger, and rightly so. While our collective conscience would rather put the Native American slaughter behind us, Churchill rebukes such apologism and reminds us that the destruction of native peoples and cultures has not ceased, it has simply become a victim of its own successes. It is tempting for the culpable to point to differences in intent to set the Nazi regime apart from European colonialism. While guilt may rest more heavily on Hitler and his Third Riech, it is merely because during the Indian holocaust there were greater numbers of guilty to share the crime."
2,Confusing & distracting,"I was looking for a DVD to focus on arm toning, but this is half arm toning and half cardio, and all a big plug to buy their TransFirmer step product. If I am toning my ARMS, why would I need to purchase a special step system, unless I am perhaps walking on my hands? There should be no need for any special equipment beyond dumbells. The cardio is done at a pretty quick pace, and feels like I need to be an aerobics instructor to keep up. Very confusing for a novice to follow. Also, it's kind of distracting to see all the huge fake breasts on the instructors as they jump all around and their breasts never move. I found myself wondering if there were I-beams in their bras and thinking that just trying to pull a sweater on over those things would be a good arm workout. I think the weight training part of it was good, but since that's only half the video, I am disappointed overall."
2,NOT GOOD TO USE A WORKOUT TO MAKE ADVERTICING,"The Firm - Jiggle Free ArmsHello.I bought this item because I was looking for a workout that helps to stop jiggle arms. the exercises on the DVD those for arms are good, what I dont like is that in the DVD there are serveral, a lot of exercises using an equipment called Transfirmer Board.I prefer more exercises target to the arms and not exercises target ed to the use of the board.CV"
1,the horrible screen protector!!!!!!!!!!!!,Do not put this protector on your screen! When you try to remove it it will leave a sticky film that's hard to remove. It's not worth it!
3,Huh/,I was to understand this was a brand new item and when i received it it was in used conditions. Not horrible but could have been better.
5,An amazin resource!,Ive had this dvd for a few years now. Before i actually had my own homestead. This dvd and its extras have been a huge resource for me. I continue to get new ideas each time i watch it!Thanks so much Marjorie!!!!!
5,"Food Production Systems, Great DVDs",Thanks to your Food Production Systems; for backyards or small farmers: DVDs I planted a small garden this year and am preparing a larger one for next year.
5,This is a Great Video!!!,"This is a great video. It was most helpful. The video is something that I will refer to over time, many times. The information is vast as well as all the resources.I have bought several to give to friends as gifts."
5,Get ready to watch this about a dozen times.,"This is a great product. It's like a semester course on homesteading. Whether you live on a 1/4 acre or 100 acres this is a resource that you need to see. Majorie creates a great learning environment. If she has a sequel, I'm in line to buy it."
5,Excellent DVD!!,"This DVD got me started on Home Food production. Like the titlesays you only need a backyard. There is so much practical information and ideas offered in this DVD that you will want to watch it several times. On top of that it also gives you ideas of additional routes to go with your own situation for irrigation, garden plots, livestock, Etc. I HIGHLY recommend this video as well as anything else from Marjory Wildcraft!"
5,GE Security keysafe,"I bought this for a elderly customer of mine who has fancy locks on her doors and sometimes she gets locked out. After reading the directions it was a breeze to set the personal combination and hanging the key safe was also no problem at all . I recommend this product to anyone looking for a sturdy, secure and convenient way to keep a key on the outside of their residence."
5,Effective and easy to understand,Definitely a great book for a beginning VBA student. It slowly builds up everything and gives you a good background on VBA before you go even deeper.
2,Not very deep in details,This would be good mostly for a person that doesn't know Excel at all and is interested in dabbling in it. If you know a little already then I would advise a more detailed book.
2,More of the same,"This is a typical J-Walk book with lots of padding eg. the complete history of Excel starting from version 1 plus lists, lists of lists etc. etc. Why would anyone want to spend 100's of hours learning all the complexities of VBA so as to be able to display a simple Message Box or reformat a range? Where is the incentive? Provide real, practical and useful examples as an inducement for people to make this sort of investment or you are merely writing to satisfy your own ego."
3,Not what I had hoped.,"Be aware that this book is not from the same publisher as the well regarded ""The Best American Series"" by Houghton Mifflin. I had hoped for equal, in-depth and fair analysis of political issues that would increase my political IQ. Instead I felt that each essay was based more on opinion than facts, although selective facts can be used to support just about any opinion. And I don't think they were chosen with balance in mind. There is only one article which is negative about the Bush tax cuts but not a corresponding positive article. There are 6 articles on Gay Marriage however.If possible, look closely at the sources of the articles (listed in the table of contents) and read the brief descriptions by the editor at the beginning of each article before buying this book."
1,What kind of lame junk is this!?,"1: Does not include AC adapter, and requires AC adapter - if you have not lost your AC adapter, you could simply use it WITHOUT this.2: Wow.. It ""displays your DS in great fashion"" how amazing.. I'm sure all your friends will be saying ""Wow, Billy really displays his DS in great fashion! I wish I was as cool as him.""3: It holds your DS in an upright position? That's a feature?4: It's $10 and it does NOTHING useful.and 5: If you need a replacement AC adapter, your not going to buy this AND an AC adapter - which makes absolutely no reason to buy it."
3,Never Really Quite Got into it.,"past Hal Hartley soundtracks have been great; beginning with True Fiction to Henry Fool. hut somehow I've never got into it. The Yo La Tengo materials are good; but not great. I extremely enjoy the instrumental segments of the soundtracks; with this one it had too much vocals for my taste. In my opinion, this is the weakest of the four soundtracks. Regardless this soundtrack still is better than most of there. Gotta love Rambo III!"
4,great product,"We ordered this item, and it's not only useful as a trivet to place hot pots on, but also great to use as a oven mitt. It's very flexible so when I pulled out a hot cookie sheet my fingers didn't get burned! I highly recommend it. It is a bit tricky to grasp the hot items, but you just have to arranget it so."
5,WADDODLES OF HOLLOW LAKE,"THIS BOOK IS SO WORTH READING, ONE THING IS THIS STORY RELATESTO THE MAJORITY OF ALL FAMILIES IN AMERICA AND ELSEWHERE.AFTER SEPT.11 IF EACH FAMILY WHO SUFFERED COULD READ THIS BOOK IT WOULD CERTAINLY HELP THE HEALING PROCESS.DORENE STANDISH"
5,Great for babies under one,This is a wonderful touch and feel book. My little girl loved it until she was one and 1/2. Now she is two and does not even want to look at it.
2,overpriced,"I am a massage therapist and I have used Khepra in the past for my client's sessions. I had always felt the price was high but I loved the balm and endured the cost. However, during a recent episode where I was running really low and hadn't ordered a new bottle from Khepra yet, I ran to the local beauty supply store and bought a 128oz bottle of their ""foot balm"" for $8.95. The smell is similar to Khepra, as is the ingredient list, and the usuability for foot massage. Massage therapists don't make very much, so to find this savings is tremendous. I saved one hundred bucks and my clients and I are just as happy!"
4,Well written and thorough,One of the better textbooks I have read. I was actually able to buy it used for $35 and sell it back to the bookstore for $50!
5,NO COMPLAINTS,I received this book quickly and it was in the condition that it stated. Happy customer!
1,arrived broken,motor is broken. Makes a burning rubber smell and doesnt turn. Postage wont be worth returning.
1,Terrible book,"I cannot understand how 10 folks rate this book full star. Probably some hanky panky going on with the publisher.This is NOT an expert book. Read up on Tom Kyte's or Jonathan Lewis' books if you want a real expert taste.For example:#1 Which expert wants to know HOW to ""uninstall Oracle from Windows""?#2 Which expert knows not what Level 0 or Level 1 backup is?!#3 Which expert needs a 200-page syntax description on PL/SQL packages? This reminds me of the silly hey-days of Java API books *bah!*Please don't buy this book - or even read it."
5,Great Read,"If you like lists of random knowledge, or if you enjoy learning the reasons behind the everyday things we say or do, then you will enjoy this book. I got this book for my friend for his birthday. It was soon being passed around from person to person, each sharing their newly acquired trivial knowledge."
3,A disappointment!,"I was very happy when my package from Amazon arrived since I ordered several books for my son, who is to become a big brother soon. I was equally sad, when he took a short look at the book, whereafter he threw it away, and hardly listened to my storytelling. I see his point though. I must admit, that the pictures in the book are rather pale and not very convincing. It is a very short book, has no ""logical"" sequence and takes you only from one situation to another with no link to the pages before. Futhermore the pictures are not really clear, at least my son did not understand them. Ex. the baby is crying - why? The baby cannot walk it says picturing him in a chair, but my son can sit in a chair too, but he can also walk. I am very sory to say this, because I hoped this book to be a help for me and him to prepare ourselves for the baby. Unfortunately it was not."
4,"A solid, but not excellent, choice","We bought the book for our two-year old son in anticipation of his new baby brother. The story is simple enough and the pictures are colorful. There is nothing wrong with buying this book. However, since it is has paper pages (not board), we really can't give it to him for his own parousal like we can his other books.The book mentioned the positives associated with the new baby. A page on how the older sibling's life might adjust in a manner perceived not in their best interest (for example - being quieter at times) was not the focus of this book."
3,dont think my kid gets it,"my first born is 20 months old, and we have been reading this book to him almost everyday for the last 3 months in anticipation for his little brothers arrival, he understands a lot, but this book didn't help, 20 months is probably too young for him to understand.personally i do not like its story, but thats up to the individual i guessit's a well made and has nice pictures"
4,"Good, but didn't like lack of mother-infant attention and bottle-feeding","My son really likes this book (he's 2) and he calls it the ""big brother book."" I like that it shows the dad being involved in infant care, but I don't like that it doesn't show the mother doing any infant care at all and that it only shows the baby getting a bottle. I want my kids to see breastfeeding as the normal way to feed a baby. Other than that, it's good."
2,Not for small children.,"When I ordered this book, I intended to use it to help my 2 1/2 year old adjust to the idea of a new baby in the family. This book is written for older children. It was not what I expected based on the book's summary. It is very wordy -- don't get this for a child less than 4."
4,Good book--I wish the baby was bestfed!,I really enjoy this book and my 3 year old does to. The first night we read it he wanted me to read it again 3 times! He really does enjoy it and we have read it every night since.My only complaint is that the baby is bottle fed. I teach my children that babies are breastfed since that is how we are intended to feed our babies! Our babies don't get milk made for cows--they get milk made especially for them!
1,"FIFA 2006 ""Voices""--","Disappointing selection of songs. Where is L.Pavoratti's rendition, during FIFA a few years back, NESSUM DORMA! It was incredible and belongs in this CD.CD should include songs from previous FIFA Championships - that made the people STAND UP and SING!"
1,Another Clarke classic ruined,"Clarke is deservedly considered one of the giants of science fiction. In recent years, for some reason, he has been producing many collaborations, and in every one of them, Clarke's genius trips over the banality of his collaborators. Why anyone thought one of my favorite books, The City and the Stars, needed to be reworked, I'll never understand. How bad is the pollution of Clarke's original? At one point in BTFoN the characters travel to earth's moon. But in TCATS, we learned that the moon was destroyed millions of years ago! It was a major plot point when the protagonist discovered the reason that the moon was destroyed. Did Benford even read the original? Does Clarke not remember it? Was the editor asleep? This is quite simply a bad book."
3,5104 Liteon dvd recorder,"This particular model is easy to use through easy guider system,like most Liteon recorders makes nice recordings.This recorder has the allwrite system but I recommend avoiding recording on the RW- discs,they tend to be tempermental.The R-,R+ and RW+ all record without problem.As with most dvd recorders the laser needs to be cleaned a lot,I would recommend cleaning laser every 10 hours.Walmarts sells cleaning discs by Philips and Maxell that work great in this particular model.Units can be set to be Region free so they will play dvds from around the world."
5,A great all-around camera...,"This camera (and all Canon SDs in general) is perfect for a non-professional photographer. It produces great quality pictures, is easy to operate, and offers many features that are both useful and fun for the user."
4,"Canon PowerShot SD800 IS, Digital Elph","I have been a Canon Elph user since early in 2004 and completely wore out the SD100. The quality of the pictures was always excellent and the size of the camera great for traveling. On the original one, the battery charger gave out on me first, and I ordered another (not cheap), then the camera just quit working a month later. So,I now own the new and improved version. I am surprised that Canon has not replaced the little plastic part that holds in the battery. My other one (just like it) broke right away. Also, I do not like the USB port door. I can't imagine it will last long. But, I would buy the camera again. Good price and good pictures."
2,Dust Spots,"Overall, this seemed like a great little camera but I ended up returning it. I took 100+ pictures when I first got it and at least 3/4 of shots using a flash (50-60 pictures) had numerous spots from dust in the air being illuminated by the flash. These spots ranged in size from small to very large. Regardless of how good everything else was, I couldn't see keeping it when numerous pictures were trashed because of this. Supposedly, this isn't that uncommon of a problem with digital cameras, but I couldn't see how multiple dust spots in most pictures would be acceptable. I have seen dust spots on my other 2 digitals but pretty rarely. One other thing that didn't impress me was how under-exposed many pictures were when using the flash."
4,Great Camera,"This is my first digital camera, and before I bough this camera I did a lot of research. I wanted a camera easy to use and this one is just fantastic it takes great pictures and video. I would definitely recommend this camera to anyone you wont regret it."
4,A Masterpiece..But.....,"From any aspect you look at this camera,it's a masterpiece.Enough has been said about the picture quality of SD800IS.No doubt about it.Just I would like to mention few problems that look strange to me.1- After using the camera almost for a month,I noticed taht the body of the camera is getting faded.Specially the edges.This shows the cheep quality of the body painting.How nice it would be if a company like canon would have been used all metal body with no painting.2-The cover of the battery and memory holder is very flimsy and made of poor plastic.3-And the most important annoying thing,you can not see the battery life on the screen!it only start flashing when it reaches to the end!!Pleaaaaaaase CANON!"
5,most amazing,"I have a DSLR at 2.5X the cost of this camera but this camera can take better pictures. It powers up quickly and the picture quality with or without flash is amazing. There are many manual features as well but the auto mode is so great that point and shoot is all you need. My heavy and bulky DSLR camera now sits in a draw most of the times. If you are just looking a camera to take great picture in any conditions, this camera is it."
3,Indoor pictures not good,This camera is light. Wide-angle works great. But the indoor and night pictures are grainy and blurry. I have an old A80. It performs much better on that. I think it is beucase the flash is not as strong.
5,Excellent Camera,"I had a Canon powershot A75, and this camera its amazing with the new features, the IS , the wide-angle lens, excellent pictures, the zoom evens is greatI recomended this camera for everything, its amazing choice!!!"
3,Why we cannot stamp the date on the photos other than postcard mode?,It is a big design flaw. The camera only allows you to stamp the date on the pictures for postcard mode only (1600 x 1200). Is there a way to work around this issue?
5,Owned many cameras,"I used to have the 3.2MP Powershot. It was very good but is now un-retreavable at the bottom of Lake Superior. The SD800 Stability function makes for much clearer pictures, the camera is much faster. The older 3.2MP would miss action shots because it was slow not the case with the SD. The battery lasts twice as long."
4,"Excellent battery, sometime very slow response","I had it about 5 months, only charged once total took 485 pictures some with flash, even recorded a few videos.Sometime when you want to take a short even fully pressed the bottom; it won't response, and showing try to flash on the LCD.Apart from that, Very easy to use and excellent picture quality, never need to extra edit again. (At least I did not edit any pictures.)"
3,Function red-eye is not working,"Got it just for a few days but really love it. Upgrade from canon A80 which still love but it is bit bulky to carry around. The pictures are so clear. The video is good too. One small thing is I can't figure out how to do color accent and color swap even though followed the advantage manual, but it is just me not the canon. Hoppfully can some one read it show me steps how to. Darn meUpdate 12/24/2007: After playing about few weeks, I decided to update the new reviews.Beside loving and all this unit (the pictures are so more clearer compare to my old Canon A80) , the red-eye function is so NOT working. After took about hundred of pictures of my son at night time inside my house, most all came out with terrible red eye, compared to my Canon A80 with this function works perfectly. I am so disappointed."
4,Greate camera with couple flaws,"I bought an Olympus FE280 but it did not take very good night and people pictures, so I returned it and got this SD800. So far I'm very happy with it. It takes great pictures under all conditions.IMHO, there are couple flaws that I really don't like. First it does not have an ongoing battery indicator - it only comes on when there's about 2-minutes of battery life left. This problem got me once when we were at an Ice-Skating event and battery died :-(The other issues is that there's no optical zoom (only digital zoom) when using the movie mode.The cheaper Olympus FE280 had both these features do I don't know why Canon didn't include it."
5,Wide angle on this Canon is fantastic!,"This is a great product. Very small, fast with no lag speed. Many adjustments.....but most of all the photos are great!This model has a superior wide angle lens not found on th 1000. Highly recommended!"
2,lens error,"As with another reviewer, I too finally got the lense error, where the lens is stuck open. This in fact is the second canon I have had this problem with, and so will not purchase a canon again. They do take great pics, but are either prone to this error, or you have to handle them very gently, neither of which works for me with kids in the family."
2,Not as good as I expected,"I bought the SD800-IS to replace my Kodak 6.1 MP camera, and I can tell you I wish I'd stuck with the Kodak. I was so confident the Canon would be better I shipped my Kodak to a friend of mine who had an older 2MP camera, so now it's gone.My main complaint against the Canon is inferior detail, and noise. My Kodak was rated at 230 pixels per inch and the Canon is only 180 ppi. The Canon may have 1 MP more than the Kodak but the detail is less because the ppi is lower. There also appears to be more noise at all ISO levels. Maybe as I fiddle with the settings it will improve things, but until then I have to say I am disappointed.It would thrill me to find out these problems can be corrected by adjusting the settings, but I'm not optimistic. If anyone has any advice or can direct me to a website that can help it would be greatly appreciated."
5,I love it!,"I got this camera for my birthday and I love the ease of use and great photo quality. The video works well, too, just don't zoom while filming because you can hear the lens moving."
4,A lot of Camera,"Good camera. Nice and small and fairly easy to use. If you want to keep it simple, controls are easy. For more complex photography, the menu system gets somewhat involved. Only substantial complaint is that the red eye reduction mode does not seem to eliminate (or even reduce) red eye effect. Camera should have red eye elimination system built in (similar to what HP has on their comparable cameras)."
2,Last Cannon for a while.,"I have had 3 Cannon digital camera's in the past and for the most part been happy until this model.This model struggles with light contrasts when half of the picture is in shadow and the other is bright. Here are a few examples:1. When shooting from a shadow or shade and taking a picture of something bright like a snow capped mountain or sun rise. Awful!!!2. Taking a picture during dusk on the beach where the sun will be bright but the rest of the photo is dark. The camera just struggles to adjust.On this latest trip i was on a friend had a DSC-T200 which took amazing photos of exactly the same things I did without having to tweak any settings. Plus if you do a feature comparison - they are not even close.The choice is yours, but I might go the Sony way next time.Good Luck!"
2,white spots,"I bought the sd800 also, and have white spots on 50% of the pictures I take indoors with flash.. I got my lenses cleaned by a tech and still the same problem... It looks like it documents the dust in the air.. so if you have a very dusting place.. youll have more of these white spots.. I take pictures of dancers... so theres more dust sweept of the floor... this is my theory Im not too sure yet.. but whats really frustrating is that I paid 500$ for it and I had better results with a disposable cam!!! Im still in talks with the shop owner cause Im really not happy with this product!!! ONe thing is for shure is that I dont think its normal to pay that much and then having to deal with spots on pictures."
2,A waste of money,"This video really didn't help ally my fear of flying. Although it attempts to cover a broad range of topics, the tape is only 28 minutes long. Subsequently, topics are introduced and dispensed without covering most of the questions we fearful fliers have. Overall, the tape seems like an airline propaganda video you'd show to children who have never flown before their first flight rather than anything that would help thinking, questioning, adults overcome their fears."
1,Terrible Video,"This video is more for the person who isn't very scared to fly. If you're like me, and can't even bear the thought of being in an airplane, this video will do nothing for you but pound statistics and things you already know into your head like Driving isn't as safe as flying etc. Don't waste your money; this is a terrible product."
2,Lots of WRONG information,"Much of the information given wrong so in my opinion, none of it can be trusted. For example, Page 51 describes a Bumble Bee (Metraclima Carbor) cichlid and says his adult size is 4 1/2 inches, which is OK for most medium size tanks. But in reality, these guys can get up to 8 inches and can be rather aggressive which could be a disaster for the novice hobbyist. The reason I give it 2 stars instead of 1 is because I really like the pictures of each species, and they seem to be accurate."
5,Just What I Always Expect From DAC but Even Better,"This is, without a doubt, one of the best David Allan Coe albums I've ever heard. I always expect great stuff from this guy, but Unchained/Son of the South really stands out. There is not one bad song on this album. A true gem."
3,Solid review of industry guidelines but EXPENSIVE.,"""Assessment, Remediation, and Post-Remediation Verification of Mold in Buildings"" is a useful summary on professional mold assessment and remediation from the point of view of the Industrial Hygienist's industry. There is no new information in this summary. It is quite expensive for an 18 page booklet. See Mold Warriors by Dr. Ritchie Shoemaker for some of the latest, up-to-date information on mold and the illnesses it causes."
1,Bad product,"I would not recommend this, this is very hard and caused much pain to my mother for whom I purchased it for due to hemroids and riding in a car. Don't buy this, there are softer products out there that work better"
3,"beautiful lamp, but impossible lightbulbs","I bought two. This lamp is beautiful, heavy, and works well IF YOU CAN FIND A BULB. It came with a bulb, a 40 watt b-8 candelabra base frosted bulb. But one of the bulbs was dead. The reason I buy lamps online is to avoid the narrow aisles of some hardware store or the chaos of Home Depot. the local hardware store didn't carry these bulbs and I'll have to go to Home Depot to find the ceiling fan type suggested by other reviews. What a pain.."
1,this was horrible,"i got this for my b-day and i need to tell you now, it stinks. okay atfirst it was alright, then it started doing weird things. like it would start doing things by it's self then my music started coming in fuzzy,so i tried some new head phones! but it didn't go away. then i just played games on it for a few months, but when i charged it it went funky the wheel almost popped off, and now i can't even use it it's so horrible! do not pay for this worthless piece of junk!"
4,I won't lie...,"The product was just what I expected. The screen is larger than that of an Ipod and the display options are fantastic even though there are two. Not very good if you want it for videos though. It only plays .amv videos and some videos won't convert to this format.EDIT 02/02/2008:This little bugger is durable!!! I'm about to purchase another one now! I've had mine since June 07 and the only reason I'm getting a new one is because I sat on it hard while it was in my back pocket! It is so durable! The plastic glass screen broke before and I just pulled it out and went along! If you can figure how to work it, you're set!Con: 'Occasionally' the screen freezes on the hourglassFix: Leave it on until the battery runs out then leave the On/Off in On position and plug it into the charger. When it charges back up to full power (when the light goes off) it will work again moving past the hourglass screen the pond startup."
2,Joy of Uke I,"I did not like this video. Too many played songs and not enough instruction. Very disappointed in it because it gave very little instructions on how to play. It is mostly Mr. Beloff playing the ukulele like he is in concert. I was looking for a video that gave me specific instructions. This was not instructional. If you are looking to hear someone play the uke, then this is for you. If you are looking for a ""How To Play"" video this not the one."
3,Not the best..but not bad either,"If you suffer from Catholic guilt, this may be good therapy. Great sacrilige ! Sadly, the story wanders and doesn't make too much sense, but there are definately a few scenes that I've earmarked for future reference. Worth a look, but only on sale."
1,Unbelievable,"Well, after ordering this item on 1/1/08, i didn't expect to get the item RIGHT away, but after not recieving the item by its' ETA, or word on when i would get it, i contacted the seller, who said his shipment was damaged, and would send me a free product along with the necklace i ordered. So, after selecting what else i wanted and sending the link off, i waited for at least three more weeks - with no word from the seller on when i'd get it. Contacting him again around 2/1/08, he said the original was enroute, and the second was to be shipped on monday. Now, the original did arrive tuesday - he sent two of the same necklace - with the same problem... the clasps are near immobile. And then on thursady, i got what i THOUGHT was the second necklace - but it was another copy of the first. Like the style, but can't deal with this again."
1,WRONG COLOR,JUST WANT TO ALERT people who ordered this on amazon that the picture showed a deep brown and I received blue. Had to return it and still waiting for the credit. Also realized that you can not use it on stovetop. Price should have been a giveaway.
3,Soapy,"It is like playing hooky from work; watching soap opera all afternoon long. The characters are so emotional especially the two main ones that the story which has a good plot ends up being non-believable. Sullivan seems to be written with split personality; so is Ginny. The path of the tale is interesting but the narration in regards to each role lacks conviction. And, for an FBI agent, Sullivan is very soft-hearted - with tears in his eyes and all - that sometimes his dialogues appear to be spoken from a female's point of view. The person behind all the killing is not hard to determine even though the writer tries her best to sway her readers from the real killer a few times; that part is fun."
1,Highly Disappointed,"I was looking forward to this book. The plot sounded interesting, and I am a great fan of Dinah McCall. To say I was disappointed is an understatement. Is this the same women who wrote Jackson Rule and Dreamcatcher??? The romance was forced, and almost like an afterthought. The part of the book about the fishing camp had nothing to do with the main plot, and was distracting to the story line. This book, in my opinion, was poorly written. I expected much better from an author with Ms. McCall's experience. If you want to read this book, wait until it comes to your library."
5,Healthiest/tastiest chocolate bar I have ever found,"This is the most delicious and healthiest chocolate bar I have ever tasted. It is sugar free, with 14 grams of fiber. There are no artificial sweeteners, and the taste is incredibly rich and creamy. I recommend buying the dark chocolate rather than the milk chocolate version because dark chocolate has all those important polyphenols. It is a little pricey but worth every penny."
4,Mini Dessert!,I love these cake molds. I have baked at least twice with them and both times my cakes have turned out wonderful. It is a great way to control proportions if you watching what you eat.
5,great,This product is great. We love watching these old tv shows. The product came quickly and was just as it was said it would be.
5,Thank You Warner Brothers,"Thank you Warner Brothers for releasing one of the most fun to watch shows in the history of television. I have all three seasons to date and the two movies when they came out on video. It is refreshing to be able to watch a show such as this without all of the colorful language that many of today's TV shows seem to possess for one reason or another. I look forward to seeing the upcoming release dates of seasons 5 to 7 and I do hope that Enos the complete series is not too far behind. The Dukes of Hazzard is one show that one never gets tired of watching and the word ""boring"" is not in this show's vocabulary. I also own the complete cartoon series (The Dukes) and it is just as fun to watch as the live action series. Again, THANK YOU WARNER BROTHERS for a suberb job well done."
5,Perfect,"When I purchased this yarn & when I received it on time, I was greatly impressed with it! Actually it was bigger (more yards) than I originally thought, & with me needing to make a baby blanket with this yarn bundle, I'll easily have all that I need and then some. Great experience all around and I'll definetly come back again to purchase more yarn as I need to."
4,Good value,"As others commented, there was no need to install a driver for Windows 7. Worked fine with my legacy Pentax portable printer with an infrared adapter; did have to get the alignment just right."
5,Works for my Intended Use,"I am using an old Toshiba Satellite 2540CDS for work, and it runs Windows 98. I needed to get an Excel spreadsheet on it that I was using to capture data; however, the CD drive and floppy drive were busted, so transferring the data that way or even getting USB drivers onto it were a no-go. Because the Toshiba had a built-in infrared port, I decided to buy this infrared adapter to put on my current computer and attempt to transfer the Excel spreadsheet between the two computers. Long story short, it worked.As a side note, my current computer that I used the adapter on is running Windows 7 Professional (64-bit)."
5,Brilliant piece of hardware,"Based on other reviews on Amazon, I bought this adapter so I could download the workout data from my Polar RS400 watch. My machine is a Windows XP box, which needed a driver from the mini CD that came with the device. My only complaint there is that there are drivers for ~50 different devices on that CD, so you have to know which specific chip is in the adapter in order to install the correct driver (this information is on the packaging).The driver installed painlessly afterwards, and Polar's ProTrainer v5 software immediately knew to use the adapter to communicate with the watch. The only grief there was figuring out that the big, clear red button at the bottom of the watch screen is not actually where the IR port is located -- the port is at the top of the watch. Once I got that straight, the Polar software and the watch communicated flawlessly.HUGE savings over the ~$50-$60 Polar wants for their branded IRDA adapter, and this thing worked perfectly. Big win."
5,Characters that grab you right from the beginning!,"I loved this book. I have recommended it to all of my friends and family already. Ms. Coakley-Thompson has the ability to create believable characters that I actually *cared* about and couldn't wait until my ""ME"" time at the end of the day to return to the book. It is a fast paced book, and I found myself casting the characters, wishing this would be made into a movie. If you are familiar with the D.C. area at all, that's an added bonus... I could actually see the places the characters visited and talked about in my mind. Terry McMillan needs to watch her back - Ms. Coakley-Thompson can REALLY write...her plots are interesting, the dialogue flows... what more can I say? Walk, don't run to your nearest book store and buy this book. If you have a book club, add this book to the list. You will not regret it!"
4,Students liked it,"I bought this product for my students at school. They enjoyed watching The Magic School Bus, as they always do."
1,Thoroughly tested; thoroughly disgusted.,"I tested this item with three flashes, two flashes at a time. Two Vivitar 285HVs, and my Canon 580EX II set on manual. At first, I thought that the pre-flash of the Canon might be the culprit for why the flash wouldn't fire. The slow and obvious recharge cycle of the Vivitar with the slave, though, clearly told me that the Vivitar never fired. That is, the Viviatr never emitted the slow whine that says, ""I am charging!"". After thorough testing on different flashes, on the shoe, off the shoe, with a PC cable and without, I can definitively say that I received a nonfunctional unit.The bottom line is that I could not fire either my latest flash (the Canon 580EX II) nor my older flashes (The Vivitars).I cannot recommend this product."
4,Pretty Good Book...,"Any books covering a heavy topic like accounting must be entertaining, informative and layed out properly so that the reader can follow along without too many problems. This book does all that and more, by providing real-life examples and lots of information regarding the application of accounting. Good shipping & great price directly from amazon."
5,Great down to Earth tax guide,"Yitz really took a lot of complex topics and made them easy to understand. If you have a home-based business and you don't understand the tax sytem, read this book!"
2,More labored than magical,"For a book with its title, I expected more magic. The romance took too long to heat up, the secondary characters weren't well-developed, and the prose, at times, was stilted instead of flowing. I found myself reading quickly at the end, not because I was dying to see how it ended, but because I was dying to get through with it."
2,XML APPLICATIONS,"Have bouhgt many WROX books and found this to be by far the hardest read, made simple things difficult and ponderous (suffering from verbal diarrhoea), referring too much to later content. Go read something else even from the web it'll save you money and time."
4,A Good text to help understand Anthropological Theory,"This was the required text for Anthropological Theory. I would have been hopelessly lost without this book. It helps understand some very hard concepts. I gave it four stars because I felt that some of the theories were not discussed in depth as other theories were. Overall, this book is a great tool to help begin to process theories in anthropology."
3,smells icky after,It smells great but only for a few minutes. I didnt really feel like my puppies were really clean
4,The best and only Gwen Guthrie collection available,"When I saw this CD, I bought it immediately, as I'd been searching for several of Gwen Guthrie's work for ages, and for some of her songs I only had cassette versions that didn't do her justice!It's amazing how all of Gwen Guthrie's fans say the same thingabout this collection: It's either missing one or two of her 'must have' hits, or the editions of a particular track on the CD is lackluster. I agree, I remember a different, better version of ""7th Heaven"" on the radio and in the clubs. I am only speculating, but perhaps the versions we were hearing were produced on a different record label or were produced by a local DJ, and are unavailable for that reason today.For fans, this collection is our only option. You may be a bit dissapointed because of a missing track, but it's a must have CD nonetheless."
2,"Seller is excellent, book is disappointment.",I had thought that with the title (Windows XP All-in-One Desk Reference for Dummies) the book would be a good reference resource to keep at deskside. Unfortunately it turned out to be more than 700 pages of info geared toward a beginner. I am not.
4,Joop---as in Yop,Joop cologne is one of my favorite scents and i have used it for years. It is getting quite expensive but is a bit cheaper on line than in retail stores.
5,muy buena,"muy buena,esta fragancia siempre ne ha gustado,es especial para usarla noctunamente,y estoy muy contento por haberla adquirido a un buen precio"
1,fake,this perfume doesnt last on the cloth.....you cant barely smell it...i think is imitation...im very dissapointed of buying perfume from here because i bought 2 and cant even use it
3,Official Prisoner Companion,"Saw original TV show in 60s,AUSTRALIA,always thought related to Danger Man. Interresting to see insights to show, how rover came about, and the ""futuristic thoughts"" of the day. An interresting read full of what ifs! yet still clear as mud answers to base line of show."
5,a great knife,this knife will outlast any of your other in my experience a high end CRKT are the best knife you can buy
1,Not the best of British Mystery series,"Compared to the Poirot, Midsomer Murders, Miss Marple, Mrs. Bradley mysteries and the Jeremy Brett Sherlock Holmes series, this set of DVDs is a great disappointment. There are only a couple of the DVDs worth watching the rest are victims of marginal acting, weak plots and dull screen writing."
4,Great Game. 1 Problem,"Don't just stand there, Bust-A-Move. It's the Arcade Classic that has cost me over $100.00 in quarters in my lifetime. And now it's on the GBA. There are Puzzle Levels, 2 Player Battles, or CPU Battles for those of you without anybody to play with.The Only Problem with this game is there is no save option. I got to level X and realized this, not cool.Here's a code to unlock some stuff in the game, making up for the no saving part.At the Start Screen hit: A,R,L,A,B,R,L,A. It will unlock 2 extra characters and a new world."
4,So cute!,I love the colors of this set. The animals in this set are much more addorable than the ones on other sets I have looked at. I can't wait to get it all put together in the baby's room.
5,amazing debut,"this volume was a pleasure to read: hilarious, thought-provoking, and enlightened. Kona Lowell is a wonderful writer and I look forward to reading more of his work! I recommend this book to all."
3,Cobra TT Racing Wheel,"The racing wheel was fun to use at first,but it takes awhile to get a feel for it.It was a little hard for me to turn the wheel,but i got used to it.The only good place to use it is the living room where there is probably a table in front of the tv.Otherwise you have to move a table back and forth after your done with it.If you use a small portable table it would have to be a heavy one otherwise it would shake and move a lot when you turn.I didn't have time or space in my room for a big table so i had to have my brother hold the wheel down for me on a small movable table so it wouldn't unattach its self and so the table wouldn't move.I didn't have a problem with the wheel it was that there wasn't any good place use it."
2,mr dibbs 30th song,"the only way i'd get this one is on vinyl, and if your into turntables, theres no rapping and this is the weakest rhyme sayers cd i've ever heard,Slugs voice does appear on this cd but its not even song format, dont waste your money on this one"
4,worth every second,"Craig Peyton's solo album ""Lifeline"" is one of those recordings that only improves upon repeated listenings. With so much attention given to instrumentation, production, and composition, Peyton's crafted songs create a desire to be heard over and over again. Stylistic influences range from jazz, to progressive instrumental and fusion, but the cohesive sound is as accessible as it is hard to categorize."
5,people who havent played should'nt give meaningless ratings,"This is an outstanding game...if you haven't played it, don't rate it, since you have no viable opinion of it."
5,"musicians enjoying themselves, energising and warm.","If you like rock music, which isn't one dimensional..listen to this. I'm a golden oldey and got a great kick from this CD. Even my daughter loves it, especially Star,Star. I live in Ireland and can't figure why this band aren't mega mega stars."
3,"Cute, Educational, but bad quality!","My daughter (10 months) loves to play with this toy. It is cute and educational. However, the quality is very poor like other products made in China. Every single time you set a piece in there or take it out a bunch of sawdust comes off. I have to constantly wipe it out and I am getting tired of it! Too bad there aren't that many of these puzzles that are for younger children and are good quality products."
5,Great toy,I am a big fan of Melissa and Doug puzzles. My daughter is 14 months and this is a perfect toy for her. Puzzles are great toys to encourage problem solving skills and Melissa and Doug craft puzzles that will endure the test of time with toddlers. Two thumbs up!
5,Fantastic Toy,My 1 and a half year old loves this puzzle. She is so proud of herself when she matches the colors and shapes and gets all the pieces back in their spaces. Its great for helping me teach her shapes and colors as well. She will often go get the puzzle and bring it to me so I can watch her put it together. I highly recommend this as a learning toy.
4,Great toy & opportunity for teaching!,"This is a great puzzle! It gives a chance to teach both shapes and colors to your little one, all while they are learning to solve puzzles. Behind each puzzle piece is the corresponding color to remind you child which piece shold go where. My son received this puzzle for Christmas, and he plays w/ it so much that I will be buying one for my godson's B.Day this spring."
3,"Sexy CDI girls, but nothing more....","If your looking for something to play with your friends and have fun, pick this game,but if you look for deep gameplay, you should pass by. That's a great deal if you pay under 20$."
1,Hard as hell.,"You all know why you picked up the game. Lets not beat around the bush. Here is the problem tho, its hard as hell. To unlock things, or characters. Its not fun at all, and should be for what the game is. Looks great and thats about it. Im a seasoned gamer, I have played and beat many games in different groups of gaming. This game is really hard and will make you more angry than happy. Rent before buying. Terrible game."
1,UPDATE: Terrible,"The game is terrible, I admit I bought the game for the girls on the cover. After I recieved the game I was so excited to play it. I popped it into my Xbox and the first 5 minutes of playing the game I was bored. There is No Story, Terrible Controls & Difficult AI. To be honest I just gave up on this game after 2 hours because it is not fun, the only thing good about it is girls in skimpy clothes. If you honestly want that kind of game I recommend the Dead or Alive Series way better than this.Pros:-Decent Graphics (for the time)Cons:-Terrible Controls-No Story-Difficult AI-Repeatative Gameplay"
1,Watch out for new DVD!,"None of the other reviews are about the new DVD. I just received that DVD and the sound is unacceptably bad. I taped the opera years ago from a TV broadcast, using rabbit ears, and the sound was excellent. So I think the problem must be with the new edition or with the copy I received. I agree with the other reviewers that this version of Rigoletto is very excellent, and also interestingly novel in the translation, which I find to be a very appropriate although not literal one."
1,Unacceptable sound,"For years, I hoped for a DVD release that would contain subtitles. Althoughsung in English, I find it almost impossible to understand what is being sung.I own a copy of this wonderful production on laserdisc but there are nosubtitles. Then this product appeared. Yes, it has subtitles!! Wonderful!I bought it from Amazon almost immediately upon its release. Unfortunately,there is something seriously wrong with the sound track. My copy has a kindof pulsing sound to it with the result that a kind of beat not synchronizedto the music becomes apparent; it is *terribly* distracting. It's such adisappointment. It is simply unacceptable even through low fidelity tv speakers.I strongly recommend seeing this great production but not on this dvd."
2,not sized like the Boston clog,"I bought this clog as a Christmas gift for my daughter in a size 42. Looks very much like the Boston style clog--beware--it is not!! The height clearance inside the clog is much smaller. My daughter has a high instep and literally couldn't get her foot into the clog. The Boston style is much nicer. Pay the extra money for a nice shoe that actually fits someone with a ""not standard"" size foot. Not the shoe's fault, of course. It is a pretty decent shoe. But you can tell the difference..."
2,Betula Licensed by Birkenstock Black Suede Clog Size: 37,Disappointing. I wear size 37 Birkenstocks and these are one half inch shorter than my other clogs!
5,Bought for my German husband - he loves them,Bought them at a discount price. Excellent value. My husband uses them and like them. Product arrived on time and in perfect conditions.
1,i believe is fake,smells nothing like dep store ... amazon refund it my money... will not buy fragrance from amazon...
1,I do not think it's real product,I do not think it's real and I can not return it because of shipping policies!!!!It doesn't smell like real one and it doesn't stay on you for a normal period of time.They say I can't return it becuase it flammable but they were able to ship to me so why can't I?I am very upset
4,Good Budget Friendly Holster,"This Galco holster is a nice holster, its very well made. It fits the gun quite well, it was a little tight when I first got it, but it did stretch and now fits very well. I do wish it rode a little lower, feels like its going to fall out, I know it won't, but it feels funny. The clip is very strong and I have no doubt it will hold the gun firmly. Part of the feeling that gun is going to fall out is just the size of the gun itself, a S&W Model 60 snub nose revolver. I like that the holster has the rough side out, it makes the holster ""stick"" better and not slide/move around. I like that this holster has a thumb break to help retain the firearm and also make it less likely someone will try to take it from you. I highly recommend this holster, it is very budget friendly and very well made."
3,So-So -- Better than nothing !,"The book was alright -- didn't really contain as much data as I would have liked (although probably a book with a ton of data, photos, patterns, etc., would cost a lot more). But it is definitely a good place to start, at least. I enjoyed the lighthearted comments in the book."
5,my son had a blast with the sports book and the net,My son was given the book as a gift. He thought it was cool. Then he sat down to use it and now he's amazed by the internet. We want all of the other 300incredible books now!!!
4,Good if your patient,"This game is one of the biggest suprises for me this year. I bought it the same day as MGS2 and never played through the game untill a few weeks ago. The game starts out a little tedius and the battle system is very simple. The story however, after about 15 hours of gameplay, is VERY VERY good. This was a huge suprise to me expecting it to just a game of run around kill the evil kings and bring back stan. If you are willing to stick with the game for 10-15 hours you will not be let down."
2,awful,"Let me start with this, I rarely trade in a game or give it away. I am very much a collector. I found this game used, dirt cheap and I remembered seeing an ad a while back. I picked it up and started playing... er watching. That's what I spent most of my time doing. Then I traded it back in. The cut scenes are long and boring. The humor is low brow and very rarely actually funny. The art style is strange... The characters and houses are similar to the sprites in other RPGs but everything else has a dark appearence. I can't say the whole game is bad because, I didn't get through very much. I just couldn't sit through the loading, the talking and the boring exploration. Games are supposed to be fun. This wasn't. It's just not fun. It's not like Tim Burton anything. It's just dark in appearance. That's it. Bottom line- for RPG collectors only. Then prepare to sit and wait .....and wait."
2,Eye Candy and one icon character,Evil King Stan is the only thing that makes this game worthwhile other than that its age shows with the turn based battle system.The Characters are interesting but the game is pretty bland story wise and unoriginal at times.Overall a great rental rather than a worthwhile purchase.
5,"""Solid Production""","Songtress Stevie Holland has great command of her voice and her sultry, elegance is complimented well by the orchestration of each piece."
5,Teaching tool,This is a fun way to teach 1st graders about the body. It opens up discussions and the students are really interested.
5,my two little girls love it,My seven and six year old really like it. They are learning a lot from this video thank you.
5,My Cat loves it!,My cat loves this food ! I do not want nasty things: (euthanized or sick animals) in her food anymore. Try it :)
3,Maybe JUST enough to pass....,"If you go through ALL the questions and try to relate the answers, and you have general knowledge of how money works in the US, you may be able to pass. Technically, the book DOES deliver what it is supposed to, which is a ton of sample questions and answers that have appeared on previous exams. If the author went one step further and provided EXPLAINATIONS to these answers, I would have definetly given it 5 stars. I used this and REA's Money and Banking and I scored a 48, which is the minimum passing DSST score. The only reason why I even bought this book was because there wasn't an 120collegecredits.com guide for it yet.120collegecredits.com is your best bet for study guides for the vast majority of your clep/dsst/Excelsior exams. Visit the website for more details and good luck on the test. BTW, I already sold my copy of the rudman book, sorry :("
3,Finally,"After 3 days delay, finally, I have received this tiny memory card today. The item from Upgrade Nation Inc. on Amazon looks different from the one I bought in Walmart. Unlike the Walmart one, this item's back does not have ""Sandisk"" logo. I like the Walmart one much more. And this item do not have package which make me a little surprised. Does the item a used one? If I can choose, I like the item in a tiny transparent plastic box which I can use to store the memory card."
5,SanDisk,VERY good price for so much product Great for shooting HD video on as well as still pics! Thanks! mv
2,deception,"the card works just fine, however...picture says 30mbpsactual is 15mbpsthis is a deceptive practice that is all to common now.in my opinion, that says it all."
2,Incorrect advertizing,"The current picture for this item shows a Class 10 card which is what I thought I would be getting. When it arrived, it was a Class 6. When I researched the fine print down below the item listing I saw that is was listed as a Class 4. I guess they should make up their mind. For me the Class 6 was a disappointment. At the present time I can't decide whether to keep it or return it. The lesson is - items on Amazon may not be as pictured."
1,Misrepresented by the Seller,"This review is for the seller, not the product or for Amazon itself. The picture of the item clearly shows 30MB/s but as some other reviewers have said, what was received is a 15MB/s. That is clear misrepresentation by the seller and I would urge Amazon to bar them from their site."
4,Ordered class 6; got class 10 (better); works fine,"Ordered Qty=2 class 6, 16 GB; got class 10 (better); both cards work fine, and are a decent deal at less than $1/GB for a high-speed card. Work well for 20MP raw pics and HD video on my Canon 60D."
4,simple design,"Basically a spackle bucket with aerator! Works like a charm. When it arrived, I assumed it was missing the plastic tubing and contacted the company. They immediately mailed me a tube! However, when putting the batteries inside, lo and behold, there was the plastic tubing curled up inside. Strange place to pack it, but I appreciated the way they reacted to my request."
4,"A good ""reference"" book","This is a ""reference"" type of book. Will be very useful if it is available when you need it. The content is good and pretty concise, providing ways to understand people's types and to use the understading to improve working relationships. However, it is not very deep. Therefore, it may not give much helps for personal relationship. (However, this is ""warned"" by the title)"
5,A must-have for every Western Movie Fan,There's only one word to describe this book: Incredible!!! It contains some of the most beautiful movie poster artwork you've ever seen - especially all these western classics from the thirties. This book shows us how bad the movie poster artwork is today.Uwe Reber
1,"ATTENTION: Amazon is a RISK to order collectibles from, damaged goods",I ordered 3 star wars figures and 2 of them had their hang tagsbent and torn. Yet they never were on a peg???This has happened multiple times when ordering figures.Two words: QUALITY CONTROL
3,"Fun, but a little flimsy","Well, I was so excited to get these cubes home to my kitty, so when they finally came I was really happy! When I unwrapped them, they were a little more flimsy than I was expecting. I put them out for my kitty, and in five seconds flat she was running through them and playing like crazy. She really does love them, my only complaint is how flimsy they are. They ""fold out"" to make a cube, and sometimes when my cat runs through them, the cubes snap closed and scare her. They also fall over a lot, making it difficult for her to get herself out of the cube. I have only had them for a few weeks, and already the wire in them is bent and that is making them even less sturdy. I KNOW this isnt because of my cat because she is just a tiny kitten...she only weighs 4 lbs! On the whole, I would recommed it for people with kittens, but I wouldnt leave your cats alone while playing with it...because they can get stuck in there when it collapses!"
1,"Very Poor,Not Recommended","This book is more about the perpetuation of misconception and stereotypical ignorance,whilst masquerading as a scholarly type of work.The author selects a group of sportsmen that are commonly misrepresented enough by the ignorant and,most often envious,Media and unhealthy public and cleverly sells this rubbish to these groups of sad characters.It picks 'evidence' and mixes and matches it to suit itself to achieve the desired end,typical tabloid type journalistic tactics,i sincerely hope the buying public are savvy enough to see this.My recommendation is to avoid this drivvel ,unless of course,you belong to the aforementioned group of dolts who look to denigrate a decent sport that promotes incredible health,strength and quality longevity.One of the most ignorant pieces of writing ive ever seen."
3,broken cd cases,CD cases were broken for the 3rd time this year. I did not have a problem like this last year.CD's seem to be ok.
2,Too many hits missing.,"No ""31 Flavors"", no ""It's a Mad World"", no ""Blue Holiday"", no ""Don't Go Home, My Little Darling"". Too many hits missing.Stay away from this one."
4,"IF YOU LIKE THE SHIRELLES, YOU WILL LIKE THIS","The quality of the CD is not the greatest, but remember that these are copies of very early productions. The songs still bring back great memories, and they are still great to listen to and dance to."
4,T.M.N.T Leonardo,"This is a very durable toy. The swords are cool too. However, disappointed with the pack that is supposed to go on Leo's back. This did not attach and will not. My son has fun playing with him though and that is what really counts...I guess."
1,crazy price,"I payed 250 dollars for it, it's was ok but not really any better than one I could have bought for 1/2 that price (125 dollars) I paid way to much when I paid $250.00. And who needs that laser what a joke."
2,WAY too complicated,"There is way too much in the way of welding skills and sheet metal fabrication. Certainly not a ""How To"" book but more of a ""How I do it"" book."
1,Disappointing,"Don't get me wrong I do enjoy David Garrett (here comes the however!) A few months ago I purchased a DVD and listened to his rendition of some of the rock classics. All great. Then I decided to purchase this DVD, thinking I might like to have it as background music when entertaining friends. It's a yawner! BORING. I'm so tired of most of the music he picked... It's all been played over and over and over by anyone with talent. He's young, attractive, seems to be compassionate and certainly talented, however, if he can't write his own music I'm not buying any more.By the way, it's only 45 minutes long with two bonus songs ... not worth the money as far as I am concerned."
3,QUALITY,"I purchased this item through Amazon from [...]. I was disappointed in the DVD cover graphics which were poorly printed difficult (if not impossible) to read. The ""reproduction"" DVD is of mediocre quality...""OK"" but inferior to the original. When I wrote the ""Seller,"" I received a less-than-polite response. I would not order from this seller again. ~0:-("
2,self inflating air mattress,The air matteress did not inflate as noted. also when I self inflated it did not hold air.Randy Mays 817-891-2050
3,Speedy Shipping,"This item arrived very quickly and is a quality product. However, I prefer the 360 degrees scent...this one is heavier and spicier, rather than light and floral."
4,No higher truth,"The item was original, beautiful and creative. However, the pewter is so soft, I don't wear it because I'm afraid I'll bend or break it."
1,D&G: My Granny's Fanny,"If this is real D&G, I'll eat it. The tie has the look, material and feel of ties that are sold on 7th ave. for 3 for $10. I brought this issue up with Amazon, but never heard back from them. I do not know how knock-offs made it to this level, but they did."
1,overpriced,"Got this same watch from ShopNBC for $84. It was a nice style but very, very thick and uncomrtable to have on...plus the strap was so thick that I couldn't get it to close properly... I had to return it because it was essentially unwearable."
2,No spin to this spinner,"Bought this ring to fidget with during class, but when it arrived it didn't spin very well. Used some graphite, helped a little, but then it went back to the poor spinning. Still looks nice, but it doesn't spin well at all."
1,Horrible - and dangerous,"Cheap. Very, very cheap. Like other reviews said, it's ok to look at, but not ok to own. The base is also very sharp. It's possible to cut your hand or the surface that this thing rests on. I'm sending it back. Not worth the price paid."
1,"Cheap and not ""jumbo""...","Lightweight, flimsy and will not handle the jumbo rolls...replacing it immediately. Don't waste your time and money. Has me rethinking the other items by Ponder on my wish list."
5,immensely entertaining!,I suggest this for anyone that grew up hearing fairy tales. I feel that you should have some understanding of the fairy tales to get the full humor of the book. I am working my way through the volumes. Each one builds upon the previous. Finally! A great fairy tale book for adults
4,Review of Fable's: Volume I,"I must admit I didn't get into this novel as thoroughly as I had expected. The back story is interesting and the concept is novel, but the dialogue and characters seemed, at times, too expected. All personal bias, I freely admit."
2,Kindle Fire version should work better,"I figured since this was one of the books in the Amazon kindle book store this book would work well with my Kindle Fire. The problem come when a two page layout is stretched onto one page of my Fire it is unreadable. This has happened twice so far and I am on # 3 of a 5 part book. Seems like the fire should be able to rotate with these books or a simple zoom would work. The pages are already small but I can live with that, the horizontal panels could not be even read with a magnifying glass because the font totally turns to chicken scratch. Overall the story gets a 4.5 and hate that I miss out on these pages and I will not be ordering the next book unless they can get this issue solve."
2,Not Bad,"While Fables Volume 1 wasn't particularly as interesting as I had hoped, it was far from bad. The comic turned out not being my cup of tea simply because I felt it attempted to make fairy tales ""darker and edgier"" but in a run down, pulp fiction way. Despite my own feelings, the art isn't bad and the story is mildly entertaining."
3,not bad,"Its not a great story, but it has piqued my interest. im hoping the next installment meets or surpasses expectations."
3,"Some chapters good, not up to date, missing information","I purchased this book to consider as a resource for a PMP study group. It does not cover PMBOK 2000, it covers the older version. The book does not cover all the knowledge areas even for the old version. Our reviewers felt that some chapters and explanations were good but some were clearly missing key points. We dicovered that the review questions were taken virtually word for word from another book. Our study group decided to go with 2 different books instead of this one."
3,More like a novel (or boring textbook),"First off, there's a lot of information in this book - probably too much unless you enjoy reading pages of lengthy paragraphs. If you're a visual person like me who prefers graphics, charts, tables or bullet points to help you understand or study, you'll be disappointed. There's also very few direct references to the exam itself. (Mulcahy's Study Guide is excellent in this regard. It's more succinct and focussed on what you need to remember and how to study for the exam).The second half of the book has many sample questions and useful explanations with the answers, but WHY does it give 5 choices where the exam is four!??Overall, you can't beat the price. But I'd recommend you pay the money for the Mulcahy book - its excellent, and has numerous handy tips on the exam and how to prepare for it."
2,Errors,"For one of the questions, the key is ""d"", but the explanation makes ""e"" the right answer. I don't know what to trust or not to trust about this book"
2,OK for general PM Concepts,"Not sure this is the book to study for the PMP. Agree that its missing the tools techniques and concepts but he made it clear up front he was not going into it. Also, the intergration knowledge area is missing. I think if he went into the format of the exam , it would really serve its purpose better.Read this after you have read the PMBOK and another REAL PMP EXAM prep book! This is great to read the day before for leisure with no pressure!"
1,I do NOT recommend it at all..,"I checked out this book from a local library, and didn't use it at all during my prep. It even doesn't cover some very important(for the exam) chapters in PMBOK. There are much better resources available.."
2,birkenstock sandals,"These sandals looked the way i thought, but are way too wide for a typical female's foot. I ordered a woman's sandal but received what seemed to be a man's sandal. I had to use the last hole and if they stretch any, will be too wide for me to keep on my foot."
1,BRICKWALLED!,"A couple of reasons to avoid this CD - first and foremost, it's hard-limited to hell....as a result, there's no clarity at all in these recordings which have never sounded so bad as on this CD. It's beyond me why engineers these days have to brickwall their mastering of songs to make them louder, the massive compression just kills the highs and ruins the sound. Secondly, the version of 'Come Into My Heart' presented here is an alternate take from the same session, not the hit version....a pity really, as although this version is stereo, the hit version only ever appeared in stereo on a rare ABC-Paramount stereo 45 in 1959.If you want Lloyd's ABC recordings in better quality, seek out the 18 song 'Greatest Hits' CD issued on MCAD-11184 in 1994. A 100% improvement in sound!"
3,THE DREAM TEAM - Average,"THE DREAM TEAM was an okay movie.. I wouldn't buy it unless I was a Keaton fan or something. It was okay to watch, and good to pass the time away if it come on TV."
2,dissatisfied,The 12volt 5 watt incandescent miniature light bulbs (clear) (E10 base) are not something that anyone in the US internet web sites seem to be able to replace. They are made by an unknown factory in China. When all the bulbs burn out you are in the dark. Wake up Amazon! you need to stock these as replacement bulbs for this product with a link TO the product.
2,DON'T BUY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,This toy came a few days ago. I deciuded to do it before the other toys I had bought. I wish I had never bought it in the first place! It took a hour to put together and it did not work good. You can't read the instructions because they are little bitty pictures. After geting it to work sorta the wheels are hard to turn. If you are looking for a working toy that is fun to put together you don't want this toy. I do not ever want to see it again!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4,Schrade TM1 Tradesman Hawkbill Lockblade Knife,"The purchase of the Schrade TM-1 Tradesman Hawkbill Lockback Knife was a good experience. The odering process was easy, communications were very complete and shipments were timely. Quality of the knife met my expectations."
4,"Good product, dont let it get too hot","Good product, the orange ""film"" that is around the lightbulb eventually begins to shed off and you are left with just a white light bulb. But cant complain for the price"
1,Strange smell,"Strange smell emitted from this lightbulb when first used. It's the right color, but the smell was kind of strange"
1,The audio version,"The audio product is read by a woman who is performing, not reading. She races through the material. She is artifical, annoying and renders that audio product useless.Don't publishers LISTEN to the reader in an audition first? What a waste. I have so little time to read, so audio is usually necssary. Thankfully, audible allows you to listen before you buy. Buy the book instead."
4,Mindset,"Very compelling evidence for parents and teachers about the choices of language we should use when teaching young people. This is about a growth oriented psychology, not rooted in knowing it all or being the best or competition."
1,Misleading Information,"This book is identical to Dweck's 2006 book ""Mindset: The New Psychology of Success."" If you own or have read that book, there's no need to get this one.It strikes me as basically dishonest to market this book as a different title, as Amazon does. For example: Amazon offers to bundle these two books (with a third) for a discount price--the obvious implication being that they are not the same book.The book itself is fine (I'd rate it a 4 stars by itself), but the misleading information prompts this review."
5,Love this stuff!,I love this sunscreen because it's so easy to apply. Often times my coworkers will want to eat or drink outside and this sunscreen allows me to brush on a new coat of sunscreen without ruining my makeup or rubbing lotion all over my body. I can easily slip into the bathroom and put on my exposed skin and be out and ready to go without taking too much time or making a scene.
5,The wounded hawk,Another exciting book by Sara Douglass which once started is near impossible to put down. 2nd part to trilogy looking forward to the 3rd.
2,jUNnKy!,"Got it at Lillian vernon cheaper and it is cheap. My son has it for a while now -code needs resetting, alarm has to be turned on and off (no 24 hr off) and I believe it's ringing 10 minutes later than wwhen 1st set-so problem with alarm. It ways about 3oz-not what you would call solid-a gadget du jour. Don't expect to have it for too long."
3,Take It Easy War,"A very Australian ""Take it easy"" approach makes a story of Vietnam War diggers less dramatic and more entertaining than military activities, insurgency, mortal dangers and simply death following in reality did.Unlike ""Kokoda"" concentrated to a great extent on operational issues, this film about fathers of recent Australian servicepersons in Iraq emphasizes on inter-personal relations, highlighting team actions and mateship as substantial values grounding military achievements.Rather romantic, this movie is an easy viewing about a steadily debated passage of Australian history the Vietnam War is."
2,It could've been worse,"I know that this and #1 stretched the storyline of Cap a little, but it was a TV movie after all. At least these were better than that stinkeroo movie that came out a few years ago. (PEEEUUU!) Also, Reb Brown at least had the build that made him playing Cap believable. Anyway, Marvel can't seem to make a decent adaptation of their heroes from the comics to the big/small screens so I'm afraid that this is one of the better ones."
3,at least he has the right outfit.,"This one is fun, and alot better than the first made for tv one. Reb brown has the build and is great as captain america here, only they skipped the whole mythology of the comics and came up with this storyline instead. But it could have been worse for a tv movie from 1979 for sure. the print is in ok shape too, but this and the other oneare of their time truly and I could never understand why they couldn't follow the comics more."
1,Terrible,"This movie completely ruined the first. The original was charming, the songs were great, the animation and the voices were amazing. The first movie had me crying in some scenes it was so good. But this one completely ruined it. It was like some cheap made for TV cartoon, even the animation didn't match up at all to the first. The lines were flat and had no meaning - the ones that did were the same from the first movie. I felt nothing throughout the movie but boredom. The storyline and plot sounds quite good at first, but that is not the case once the movie starts. As an avid 'Lilo and Stitch' fan, I felt completely dissapointed by the sequel - and if you're a fan, I would advise you not to even go near this 'movie'."
5,Stitch the Movie,I received this days before I expected it to arrive. This was great. My son will be so excited on Christmas.
1,Please don't buy this movie.,"This movie has pretty much nothing going for it. The Animation is awful, and the story is dumb. I really wish I could have back the 64 minutes it took to watch this piece of junk.It has been likened to Saturday morning cartoons. However, I disagree. I have seen much higher quality on Saturday mornings.Lilo and Stitch had a beauty to it. It was evident that an incredible amount of thought and care went into each and every frame. Even the supposed villains had motivation and charm all their own. You felt for Stitch, but you also felt for the aliens that were hunting him.Not so in this movie (although I am giving it one star because of an awesome, new villain who is in the shape of a rabbit).Disney released this trash just over a year after the original came out. How much care do you think they put into this one?"
3,Very enjoyable and fun!,"True that this Disney sequel follows in the same line as all the other Disney sequels in the fact that they are never as good as the origial, but this is still an excellent film. If your a Stitch fan (as I am), you can't go wrong with this film.It is very funny and fairly clever. Makes a good addition to any Disney film collection."
3,Sadly disappointing,This sequel is sadly disappointing compared to the original movie. The characters are too flat and too many of the gimmicks of the original movie are recycled.I expected something different for this movie.
1,Disappointing Sequel,"Compared to ""Lilo and Stitch"" this is a giant step down. The animation, music and story remind one of a cheap Saturday morning cartoon. I was tremendously disappointed. My two kids walked out of the room after about 20 minutes. The new characters are too cute and not original at all as compared to Stitch. Animation is poor and choppy. The music must have come from a Barney or Care Bear movie. The story line is booorrrring.I absolutely loved ""Lilo and Stitch"". It is one of my favorite all-time surprise likeable movies. I didn't expect much but was pleasantly surprised. I will forever be a fan of the original.This sequel is not worth the investment. I wish I hadn't bought it. Ten minutes into the movie, you'll wish you hadn't bought it either.Too bad. A sequel had a lot of potential."
2,Nothing new here...,"I don't know.. this is real bland religious paranoia. Mostly a rehash of other ""Illuminati"" writings by better authors. I read this stuff for the humor this kind of writing has, but this just left me feeling blah... it also is very dated... diatribes against the Beatles don't hold a lot of water now adays.Lots of better paranoid works out there.. skip on this one (or just get ahold of some Chick tracks, as this reads as a novelization of Chick comic books.. now there's an idea!)"
1,A WASTE OF MONEY!!!!!!!,"People, please do not waste your money on this junk.We will publish our manifesto (The Illuminati Manifesto) soon, now that the times are better and ripe for us to come out in part.In the meanwhile, do not pay any attention to these conspiracy theory-idiots who have written countless volumes of lies about us.Visit OneWorldOrder.Ord which is the ONLY Official Illuminati website on the internet. There you will have an opportunity to get a glimpse of who and what we really are."
4,Tranquil Cove,"Most of the CD I love. I wanted a CD that would provide soothing background music. However, I'm a music major, and track #1 has some repeated piano motifs that call my attention to the music rather encouraging me to relax. For maximum enjoyment, I skip over that track and part of another."
2,The Santa Clause 2 -- not #1,"Though this was an amusing film, it is nowhere near as enjoyable as the first one. Both my daughter and I felt that the scenes at the North Pole with the toy Santa were over the top and rather disappointing. More time spent with the real Santa and his hunt for a Mrs. Clause would have given this tale the depth and touch of seriousness that made the first one such a success. Not a badly spent afternoon, but don't give up anything for this one. Waiting for the video would not be a mistake."
4,Good follow up to The Santa Clause,"While The Santa Clause 2 may not pack the same punch as the original Santa Clause starring Tim Allen, this sequel is a fun addition for your Christmas viewing collection. Taking up the story of Scott Calvin (Allen) eight years after he became Santa Claus, this hilarious sequel presents the problems Scott faces when he finds out that his son Charlie's name appears on the ""naughty"" list. Scott faces the dilemma of either finding a wife by Christmas eve or giving up his much-loved position as Santa Claus forever. You'll love watching how the story unfolds with the help of his loyal elves and much warmth and holiday fun."
3,Fun for younger children,"In Santa Clause 2, Tim Allen (who inherited the role of Santa when he put on the red suit) discovers that he must marry and marry fast! Meanwhile, his teenage son has become a ""tagger"" and is in big trouble at school. Tim (minus Santa's extra pounds) falls for the pretty school principal, and before you know it, they are married.Adults may find the script to be poorly written and the plot corny. However, I think young children who still believe in Santa will love the story and the cute reindeer. The North Pole and Santa's workshop are well done and the movie oozes happiness.Tim Allen looks uncomfortable with the dialog and hams it up way too much. Elizabeth Mitchell, as the principal, lacks charisma and is instantly forgettable. The elves try way too hard to be cute, but in spite of this it's still a colorful and cheerful Christmas movie and children will enjoy it."
1,price,the price for this on dvd at wal-mart is $15.87 for the same movie. i will have to buy it there unless you will match the price of wal-mart's.
3,The Santa Claus 2,I loved the first one..the 2nd was fair and the 3rd one was a disappointment. But still good to have the 3 set and fun to watch.
2,Does Not Live Up To Expectations,"This is a children's movie, that, unfortunately, fails to entertain adults. Tim Allen does a very good job as Santa Claus, however, it is the writing that disapoints.The opening of the movie fails to grab you and make you want more. The movie starts off extremely slow. There is a little tension as Santa must find a wife by Christmas, but the story from that point on is highly predictable. The viewer knows the first woman he meets will not work out. If she did, then what would they do for the remainder of the movie. The next woman Santa meets is the most unlikely choice, therefore, it is the one that works out. Again, highly predictable writing. The ending is forced. It is as if the writers ran out of time and just slapped an ending on the movie.Your children will probably enjoy it, but adults should wait and rent it. Save your dough."
1,Do you really think Walt would approve?,"I'm a very liberal person and i have no belief in political correctness but somehow i don't approve of how the legend of Santa Claus is being portrayed. Is this really the way we want our kids to think of Santa? (those kids that still believe in Santa that is). Please remember folks that the legend of Santa is really based on a real person, Saint Nicholas. This film as well as the first version isn't how i would like to remember 'ol Saint Nick. Somehow after working and meeting Walt Disney, i don't believe that he would of approved of this film either."
