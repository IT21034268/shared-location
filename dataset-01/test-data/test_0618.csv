3,OK addition to the Guild 2,Not too much to say it adds a few things but the gameplay and graphics are the same. Recommended if you can get it cheap just for the additions and new storyline.
1,This book is TRASH written by fanatics!,"I have never been so offended by a book. Even worse is Justin Lookadoo's website. This book assumes that all boys want one thing and will do anything to get it, and that all girls are either good little religious freaks or hookers on the street. Just reading the chapter titles alone should make you put this book right back on the shelf. Don't waste one second reading this garbage... As for the copy I have, it's made good kindling for our fireplace."
1,Extremely One-sided,"Continuously puts down males & says that all males are out to get a female into bed, ex.: ""If a guy tells you that he loves you, he is lying. He just wants to get you into bed."" Another example of being biased is tickling. If you are dating, tickling is only a way of ""getting the blood flowing."" If you aren't dating however, it is ok. Rubbing a girls back is a way to ""feel a girl's bra straps."" If you are truly a Christian, you wouldn't critisize on a biased scale, and you would give some guys credit. Not all guys are sex-driven hormone-raging freaks. I think Justin should stop trying to get all the females to be on his side & give his own gender some respect."
3,Soft and organic but doesn't fit.,I bought this mattress pad for my new baby's crib and was so excited to use it. Finally the day came to set up her crib and I was so disappointed to discover that it doesn't fit her mattress. It is so soft and would have been perfect - and my preferred mattress pad - if only it would have fit. What a waste of a potentially great product.
3,Talking in Riddles,"Who to trust? That's the ultimate question. It is a world of law enforcement, government sector, high profiles, and criminals. Betrayal seems to be the main subject matter. A woman starts acting recklessly and her friend later found her dead. The friend thus investigates not knowing that a big undercover is taking place which coincides with her pain of losing a friend. The writer tries to confuse the reader with many different characters and secretive typed dialogues. Good plot but with disconnected tendencies the story appears bland."
3,Please tell me the titles of the other books in the series,"I have this book, but after reading the reviews, I realize that I should read the prior books in the series first. Please tell me which books preceded this in the series. Please disregard the rating, but I couldn't submit my question without making a rating.Thanks"
2,XP Issues,"I installed Chessmaster 9000 this morning and I'm very disappointed. The graphics are great and the program is very robust, but it keeps freezing up on me. I'm trying the tutorial area and after 15-20 screens, or when it accesses the CD (presumable for more data), The program closes and Microsoft asks for an error report."
5,The best chess program ever!,"Chessmaster 9000 is the best of all the Chessmaster Games, and probably the best chess computer game period! It is an improvement of Chessmaster 8000, which is almost as good as 9000, in some ways:1. I think it has different players2. Josh Waitzkin made another chess course, ""Psychology of Competition"".3. ""Larry Evan's Endgame Quiz"" is in the classroom for the intermediate player.4. There are more classic games in the library5. The new 3d chess sets are some of the most awesome things in Chessmaster 9000These are probably the best new things in Chessmaster 9000. However, if you don't know if you should buy it or no not right now, then you probably shouldn't. Chessmaster 10th Edition will be available on August 10th, I think, so you should probably just wait for that one. So don't buy Chessmaster 9000, now that the 10th edition is coming very soon."
5,Super Learning Tool,"Chessmaster9000 begins with the basics. It teaches proper moves of each piece. My 7-year old grandson is learning from this CD. However, it can challenge many avid players. It really covers all the bases of Chess."
5,Chessmaster 9000,"Chessmaster is the premier computer chess player for a PC. However, I found Chessmaster 9000 to not be as user friendly as previous versions. I did own Chessmaster 5000 and liked that version better. Chessmaste 9000 had upgrades to the skill level, which is fine. However, some changes were made to features that I did not find to be improvements."
1,can't install on windows 7 laptop,cannot install on brand new toshiba portege with windows 7. can't rate the game because can't install. wish i had purchased a program that i definitely knew would work on my laptop.
2,Greasy,"I bought this because of all the good reviews. However, my daughters and I have a chronic skin impetigo condition and I had been hoping with this to finally make it go away. I'm sure this is good for humid areas, but not only did it not clear away the fungal infection, it was very greasy. I should stick to my old $1.00 cream. That clears it up in 2-3 days."
4,Three CD set covers Como's 1970s covers,"If your interested in hearing some of Perry Como's takes on 1970s era hits, this package will be well received. He turns his mellow vocals on Snowbird, Close To You, We've Only Just Begun, Something, Yesterday and many others with good results. This three CD set does contains some of his big hits, It's Impossible, And I Love You So, Papa Loves Mambo, but not all and it is not meant to be a greatest hits collection. The sound quality for the most part is excellent, but a few selections are over modulated and this distracts from the overall quality. But this is the best compilation available that offers listeners an excellent array of Como's covers of 70s hits."
2,"very good info, but the writing style is terrible!","Chief Brunacini obviously knows his stuff regarding fire command. However, the way this book is written makes it extremely unpleasant to read. His over-friendly style is hard to follow, and the use of parentheses is way out of control. He puts text in parentheses (xxxx) several times on almost EVERY PAGE! Some of this text is so long you have to go back and re-read the first part of the sentence to remember what he was talking about. The worst part is, this ""extra"" info is usually completely unnecessary.Finally, this book could be half the pages, and still contain the same amount of info. There are just soooo many repeat topics.I usually read quite fast, with good retention, but I have read this book three times in a one year period, and I can hardly remember any of it."
4,Very handy!,"I really like this set. It makes measuring oil for various recipes much easier. I love being able to dress pasta with one hand and stir with the other.It does drip a bit, so the dropper shouldn't be held outside of the base or a dish for too long."
4,Very Unique.,"In the year 1600 two warriors disappeared from the battlefield at Sekigahara when a meteor crashed. Those warriors names were Kyoshiro Mibu and ""Demon Eyes"" Kyo. 4 years later a bounty hunter named Yuya captures Kyoshiro. She soon finds out that he is sharing a body with the soul of ""Demon Eyes"" Kyo. I bought this series a DVD at a time when it came out. It's a visually stunning anime. It also has very good voice acting and music. There are also a lot of cool characters that use some awesome techniques. It gets very weird at the end though. This anime does lack something that is hard to put my finger on. I think for me it would have been more interesting if there had been a little more emotion between Yuya and Kyo. The struggle he had within him and his feelings for Yuya may have made the series 5 stars for if they were explored little more. All in all this is an impressive series and it's a good buy."
4,Liam Clancy-A Great Balladeer,"This CD delivers some of Liam's most tender singing. To agree with the other reviews, the title track is sub-par, and I would reccomend another version. Most of the songs are great, but the last 2-3 aren't so great. Most buy an Irish CD to hear Irish music, and these last few are overproduced, and the last one is an English music hall song. Still, a good CD-Recommended."
2,Infinite Mistakes,"What can I say...as a student I am not impressed with this book at all. It is full of mistakes. How are students supposed to correctly learn the material if their texts are full of mistakes?I especially recommend that you steer away from buying the solutions manual. The text's solution guide does not even match the manual.I would love to sit and list all of the mistakes, but frankly it would take me an infinite amount of time.The book also includes free access to [a website], which inconveniently does not list the mistakes in the book. I would give the authors more credit for their book if they would put their mistakes on the website instead of forcing students to wade through murky waters."
5,terrific!,"Back in the 70's we were into the new jazz fusion sounds, but I never bought this Fullmoon album. I heard my friend play it and it was terrific and the life of the parties. But I never got around to buying my own, until now, some 35 years or so later, but in CD form...and it's still terrific and even better since I haven't heard it for awhile. Still the bomb! This Japan CD version has an added bonus song that's great in the same style of music."
5,Just as good as the first,"The second stage is just as good as the first, only it is half the length. They also include the Extra Stage movie Battle 14 which is about the Sil-Eighty and its two drivers which is about the length of two episodes. In the extras on the Battle 14 disc they include the uncut movie. The Third stage is a full length movie and does seem to com to somewhat of a stopping place for the series, but don't worry! They made a stage four and it doesn't feel like they just tacked it on."
1,The worst computer game! How could they?,"I am eagerly awaiting the PS2 version so I can see if its an easier game to play. The controls (stinks). Its very slow on my computer. The graphics look good, but not good enough. Maybe the console versions will be good. If not then I will play the GameBoy Advance version which will (chances are) be a little easy. I'd rather watch the mating habits of pocket lint than play this game. I warn you, wait until the console (GameCube, GameBoy Advance, PlayStation2) versions come out, rent them and then decide if you want them."
4,This is a very good game............,This is a very cool game. you'll get addicted to it for awhile then about a week later you'll play it every now and then. This game is very action packed! Each time you beat a mission you'll get some new outfits. (an outfit is a set of weapons to use during a mission just incase you didn't know.) If you're mom dosn't like you to get games where you kill people just put on a sad face and tell her that there is no blood(because there isn't.) and say please alot.
1,Not worth your money,"It barely follows the story line of the Sum of All Fears, same dumb format as Ghost Recon, and only 11 short, easy missions. It doesn't even allow you to choose your own weapons, you have to choose from a pre-made package. If you are a first time FPS player, get this. If you are a hard-core FPS player, it's not worth your money."
4,Halloween Night,"I read the book called Halloween Night by. R.L. Stine. I gave this book 4 stars because it is very suspensful and it draws you in more and more every page. The characters aren't who they seem to be and the plot gets thicker every chapter! It is about this girl named Brenda and her friends Traci and Dina that hate Brenda's cousin Halley. They are out to get her, it seems innocent enough until something goes wrong! Her plan backfires. Now the bad things are being done to her! But by whom? Is it Halley, the jealous cousin? Is it Traci.. her best friend? Or is it Dina, the one you would least suspect? You'll have to find out for yourself and check out the book Halloween Night by R.L.Stine."
2,"""SEQUELS SUCK"" - ( Jamie Kennedy : Scream 2 )","Sequels suck, and Halloween Night II is no exception. Again Brenda suspects Halley, but like the original, she's totally wrong. There was only one person other than the murderer to suspect, and that was Dina ( who was released from the ""hospital"" ). Dina is the prime suspect, but like Halley, it is too obivious, so, who else is there ???"
5,Works great,"Used it with adapters for cell phone, battery chargers in India. Worked great. Fits tightly at both ends (US two prong on one end and the standard 3 pin plug used in India). Would definitely recommend it."
2,Not what I expected,It was not what I expected I need more detailed information and this seems to be a cheat sheet I can't say I would purchase another of this type of material. I can't blame the publisher I thought I was purchasing something else
1,smells bad,"I purchased this after seeing many positive reviews...unfortunately, the negative reviews regarding smell were right on. It smelled like permanent solution and did nothing for my hair."
2,bad deal,This will not staple or brad into wood.could not use on wood.Would not recommend to the wood hobbyist.Maybe good for papper
5,Best FPS,"This game is fantastic. The Ghost Recon community has created wonderful mod packs to add weapons, maps and missions. The only disappointment is UBI.COM. Their (UBI) online gaming system is terrible. The best way to play online is to have a friend host it over the internet."
4,Not Just About Schizophrenia,"A memoir about a son's investigation into his father's downfall due to paranoid schizophrenia.A poignant look at the travails of the mentally ill in this country that made me think twice on subfreezing winter nights when I get to go inside a nice warm home. I was also touched by the themes of family and connectedness with humans, be they homeless, mentally ill, or just family members that we've lost touch with over the years."
5,a lot of great tips!,I stumbled on this book on one of my online classes. It was a recommendation from an instructor. I found that it has great practical tips to help to get people lives easier. I applied lots of them in my own home and shred few with clients and friends/ I recommend!
5,rectangular grill pan,"this is the most wonderful pan ever. i found it by accident, began using it to discover that meat stays so moist in when cooked on this. went online and purchased 4 more for members of my family. worth the money!! great on electric stove, which is what i have."
2,Too many typos,"Seems like it might be an enjoyable book, but you can hardly read it for the typos. The word ""the"" is spelled ""lithe"" on the first page and there are two additional words with incorrect embedded hyphens. Clearly, somebody threw the Kindle edition together on the fly and didn't even bother to read the first page.Amazon: why do you let publishers get away with such lousy Kindle versinos? It's your platform, how about defending your users a little bit, OK?"
3,Was it worth it? Yes,"A must for the Pet Shop Boy fan who wants a complete collection. Two tracks stand out as being excellent (and that is why my 3 point vote) - Fictional's cover of ""Opportunities"" and Momus's version of ""So Hard"" make the disk worth the cost. Nice sound quality on all tracks."
1,Forgettable!,"this books is thin, both in content and in pages. Ill sum it up for you. You remember better if you pay attention, and you recall better if you relax. With no particularly insightful tips, or techniques save your money, this one is forgettable."
4,Worth the price used,"After a brief but helpful introduction, the authors provide 99 recipes in three main sections: vegetables (55), meat (18) and fish (26). The sections are further divided by ingredients, so you get three cauliflower recipes in a row, and, later, two with scallops, and so on. I'm personally appreciative of the number of bean/legume recipes (10), and there are several good ideas for pesto and lasgane sprinkled throughout.The recipes range from very easy to mildly challenging, but the authors do not cut corners with ingredients. There's no garlic powder or canned crushed tomatoes here (canned peeled are okay). The illustrations by Miriam Dougens are nice, but I always prefer photos. This book will not lie open and flat on its own.EDIT: also, there's no index."
1,"""Disappointing""","The buyer must be informed that this work is a mere pamphlet, containing barely twelve pages, five of which are the composed of the introduction. It also should be noted that the obscure Christian mystic St Dionysius the Areopagite's work the ""Mystical Theology"" contained here is essentially useless without the rest of his body of writings; it is difficult to get an idea of the whole with only a part of this sage's theology. So for anyone seeking to find a comprehensive view of St Dionysius the Areopagite's theology in a single volume they definitely should not look here. Instead check out Colm Luibheid's ""Pseudo Dionysius: The Complete Works"" (Classics of Western Spirituality) for a full-scale treatment of his theology."
4,Ricky Ricotta Robot,"We love Dav Pilkey. He writes perfect boy humor. This book was geared to boys younger than ten generally. If it encourages reading, it is good - and this does."
4,"Clean, sturdy and professional, improve the pockets","The notebook is very clean looking, professional in appearance and function. The hard sides make it more sturdy and durable than soft sided notebooks. The paper is good quality, no bleed through and holds up well to my scribbling, the perforation is a good feature. Labels are a neat idea, I see someone suggested them and Cambridge came through, thanks!I think the pockets are a great idea and very sturdy, but they're just barely big enough for the notebook's paper (when ripped out along the perforation). They aren't quite long enough for 8.5x11 copy paper, the top 1/4 in. sticks out the top of the notebook and the pockets only hold a few pages before it starts getting difficult slide anymore in. If you're going to include pockets and call it a ""business notebook"", the hard cover should be big enough to cover all the papers you'll put into it.All in all, it's a good notebook and worth the money. It has taken the place of my padfolio!"
2,Not their best,I don't think I'll be spending much time with this CD. It doesn't effectively convey the darkness this band is capable of. I don't care for the bass heavy mix either.
3,AutoLISP Programming Principles and Techniques Rawls/Hagen,"I am AutoCAD Programming instructor at a technical college and have used this book for several semesters.The book is a good reference reference with a good DCL section however I feel it is lacking in ""real world"" applications.Also it needs to be updates to include visual lisp functions."
3,Good but no good to me,"Shipping was fast, and RTA was faster. It did not work on the model drill motor I have. Although it was listed in the models it would fit. The service was great, they returned it with no problem even paid the shipping. I am just sorry it didn't fit."
2,battery loses charge in 2 days,I have 2 of these batteries. They both lose all their charge after one day. But model # 840639 19.2V UniSource(tm) 3-5 Hour Battery & Charger Kit is a battery [i have 2 of these also] which holds a charge for over 2 weeks! But i can not now find the 840639 for sale on the internet.
5,Great Flavor!,"I am an Earl Grey fan, and had tried many different brands. Once I tried Stash, I never needed to check another. It's a wonderful tea, with a full bodied flavor. A great pick-me-up at any time of day... and it comes in decaf too for evening enjoyment."
3,I Like Chai,I think I'll go back to the regular version as the DOUBLE SPICE was just a bit too much in the evening. I would have been fine in the morning but I'm still a coffee girl then.
2,different ... not like chai to me,"This tastes nothing like my two favorite chai teas, Celestial Seasons and Allegro. It reminds me of Constant Comment (an old Bigelow tea, I believe)."
4,NICE <3 <3 <3,"As I type this review, I am enjoying a nice warm cup of Double Bergamot Earl Grey Tea. You can really taste the background notes of Bergamot with a hint of some kind of spice that I can't put my finger on. I will purchase again."
2,not a strong enough flavor,"I didn't think the flavor was strong or distinctive enough. A pretty inoffensive tea, but after being spoiled by Tazo's Teas, it's hard to look at a tea like this the same way."
5,Delicious!,"I didn't like tea very much until recently, and to me sugar and milk make tea taste disgusting. I've enjoyed a few flavors but when I got my hands on this, I knew it was meant to be. You take the teabag out of its pouch and it smells delicious, better than any tea I've ever smelled. Seriously, they could make potpourri out of this stuff! Compared to other chai's that I've tasted, this is my favorite. It comes in both decaf and caffeinated, so you can have it anytime... and just, yum. I highly recommend this tea!"
3,Meh...,"I tried this product to see if I could make creamy, starbucks quality spiced chai at home and was underwhelmed. A much better product is provided through Mocafe, Precious Divinity Spiced Chai powdered mix."
3,A bit of the same from this Genre,"I first was introduced to power metal in the late 1980's with bands like Iron Maiden and Savatage. What I liked about them was (esp Savatage) that there was more than meets the ears. The songs were well writen and played. With bands like Heavenly, the songs are played well, but the songs writing suffers. Now this band is no better or worse than any of the other power metal bands of today (esp the Euro ones) I can put on a CD from Rhapsody, Stataverouis, Hammerfall or Angra and I would never know the difference.The production and overall sound is above average, but it wouldn't hurt if the drummer knew a different beat than the one that sounds like a motor. Can you say HEADACHE?"
2,Doctor Who The Myth Makers,"Peter Purves narrates the story as Homer who participates in the story of Doctor Who and Troy.Unfortunately, the story is long and the narration sometimes goes off to side comments which really drags down the story. It's over 4 hours but it seems much longer due to the narration!Too bad the actual audio is gone along with the actual taping of the television episode. Wondering if it was much better than this audio narration. It probably was!Not a very good story and glad that it was finally over when the story ended!That's the problem with the older episodes as many were destroyed and sometimes the audio was saved for certain episodes. Unfortunately, this was one of them!"
1,Not Happy At all,"On 11/25/09 i went on the site I typed in the make, model, and year of my vehicle and it said that the part was a match for my vehicle and it wasn't. I am still waiting for my refund and a response which I am very unsatisfied with how this is turning out so word to the wise make sure you know what you are getting because you may not get your money refunded back to you."
2,I love Larry's stuff but this was just a bad movie,"The debate over this movie appears to be heated. Here are my two cents. I have been a Larry fan for many years and have seen him live several times. The Blue Collar shows/movies are wonderful platforms for Larry to shine. Regretfully, this is not a well written movie and Larry suffers for it.One of the bright spots in the show was the supporting cast. Larry's partner, played by Iris Bahr, shows great talent and promise in her role. She made the most of a quirky character.I would recommend that if you just want to see this movie, rent it. If you are a die-hard Larry fan, go ahead and pick it up for keeps. I'm hoping that Larry gets a second chance to be highlighted as he is absolutely hilarious and could really do well if given a quality script to work with."
3,decent movie,"decent movie, but only if you like Larry the Cable Guy. Get out the pork rinds and r.c. cola, and you'll be just fine."
5,"An excellent ""Goldberg Variations""","This is really an excellent interpretation of Bach's masterpiece. If you are going to buy a version of this work on harpsichord, you should consider this recording. Gilbert gives a beautiful performance which moves you like many other harpsichord versions cannot. Gilbert's approach to repeats is also very reasonable. He'll use repeats depending on what form the variation takes so that the ""flow"" of the work as a whole is preserved. Overall, a very impressive and recommendable recording."
5,Great new Christmas tradition!,"Joyful and educational addition to this wonderful biblical series. This dvd was so interesting. It shows where many Christmas traditions came from. I especially like the poem by Buck Denver, it is warm and fun at the same time. I highly recommend it!"
1,Something is wrong here!,"I saw the writings by Chokyi Nyima and Tulku Urygen. Two great teachers and worth something.So II open the book and see a quote by Sogyal Rinpoche (page x) along with a lot of editorializing by Schmidt about the ignorance of the world. Then the book opens to another quote, ""Those who follow the path of lust cannot attain the great way..""And I remember that Sogyal Rinpoche was sued by his female students for improper sexual advances, including having them do strip teases, etc..And I see writings of Chogyam Trungpa, the alcoholic who made new students strip in front of a group, among many other things.I think it's time for a valid, honest people's spirituality which does not demean others and is not hypocritical. Reject those who purvey something which looks like the devil's rear end, if you pardon the Christian image."
1,Beyond gender and beyond sanity,"If I understand this weird little book correctly -- and I fear that I do -- Fernbach is telling us that the only way to ""save"" the human race is to transform the human body through evolution, no doubt with the aid of mad scientists, into a genderless something-or-other that would, among other things, do away with sexual orientation, and thus ironically do away with homosexuality. But perhaps this is what he had in mind. The only way to save the village is to destroy it."
3,good nutritional information,"Although very self-praising, this book has some good information that can be applied to good use when beginning a juicing program. It is very lengthy and convoluted. I could not bring myself to try the coffee enemas, nor do I think they are as healing as is portrayed by this doctor. I was not able to find his record of cures of cancer using coffee enemas within the NIH pubmed archives. The concerning part is that his daughter moved the clinic out of the country to Mexico, where medical guidelines are not as strict, which may be a red flag."
4,Salt lamp,Love this lamp. I'm not sure yet but I THINK it's helping purify the air. Not sneezing as much.
5,Love the Lamp,I love this lamp. The appearance of it is beautiful!!! It was received very quickly and without any damages. I intend to buy some more as Christmas gifts.
3,Leadership handbook,"Great guide and information, very helpful in my school studies would recommend to others if needed for leadership guide information."
3,Worth a Look,"Interesting movie for fans of the WWII Black and White genre. Reasonably good plot and characters, if a bit simple. Due to when it was filmed the movie is a bit heavy on Greek resistance flag waving and such, but if you can get by that its not too bad at all. Its the ""kidnap the bad guy"" plot with a very good location and some twists. Not quite the Guns of Navarrone but watchable and collectable."
4,Good product for me,"I have used CD Fix-It for my karaoke disks, and this product seems to work great. Some disks needed a second cleaning, but for the most part, it was a quick clean and the disk was ready to use. I don't believe in using highlighters or anything like that to repair disks. And there have been times where other peoples karaoke systems would damage my disks. This product does the trick. And when you're spending on average $15 per disk to purchase (and you can't copy some karaoke disks), this is definitely a product to have in your arsenal."
2,You have to have a top-of-the-line machine for this,"I waited to buy a new computer before getting this. I bought a brand-new computer with what I THOUGHT was enough memory, a good graphics card that ran well on everything BUT this and even a new joystick.Suffice it to say that I was surprised when this game locked up frequently and one of the flight demos would not even play!Suffice it to say I was even MORE surprised to air my concerns on the forum for this game to be told that my brand-new computer is too antiquated for this game!The game got traded-in. If you don't have a dedicated platform for gaming only with a lightspeed processor, a $10,000 graphics card and 3,000,000 GB of memory you'll have problems with this.I never could map my joystick buttons to even be able to fire a weapon.And suffice it to say as well that I did not like the on-disk ink-sucking ""manual"" and ""reference card""...a disturbing trend among most games these days.At least Ubi-Soft still have done well with IL-2 Sturmovik!"
1,Lock on really flies,I found this game flies best if you remove it from your computer and toss it like a frisbee. I looked forward to this game for a year....What a BIG disappointment.
4,Greatest Comeback Ever,"I bought Lock-On after waiting for the price to drop because I am an avid gamer and was also afraid of spending so much on a simulation that might be beyond me. Well I worry no more, the game can be patched to 1.02 with a download and a double click, absolutely easy and the game goes from very playable to extremely playable. Some complained about bugs before, well supposedly this fixes all of them, I've not crashed once despite modding the game numerous times using a program called LOMAN. The game is stable, run well if I use modest (still looks great) settings on my GF4 ti4200P. The cd comes with an extensive manual that I got printed out to help me learn, and the game comes with great tutorials. I'm having a blast despite a simple joystick. Completely unique gaming experience if you love flying and want insight into modern technology while enjoying yourself."
2,Needs work!,"1)Does NOT work with win98 like the box says.2)System specs on box are LIES! You need alot closer to the top-end system specs to play with even medium settings.3)Support sucks! No keycard in early release boxes, no manual at all and pdf manual on disk is riddled with errors(like the program).And terrible message boards.4)F-15 radar doesn't work right5)Aim-120 missle doesn't work right6)UBI.com game service doesn't work right.7)Game has a HUGE memory leak in it.8)the sky is blue, and so will be your computer screen.9)Does not support motherboards with Nforce2 chipsets even after 2 years of delays.Spend your money on liquor and get drunk this weekend, you will have a better time than playing this hacked-together peice of crap(or trying to play it, anyway)."
1,"Hey man, hippies are cool, dig?","Man, the heavy cat who came up with this sticker must be a real square. Must be on a bad trip and needs to chill out in the bummer tent. I wouldn't cough up any bread for this un-hip sticker. Peace out."
2,Standard Fare,"Although I have enjoyed JLD books in the past, this one was disappointing. They plot trudges along, only held up by various dangers that befall the main character. There is very little original material and it follows a well worn trail used in Westerns before it. Our heroine is a bit spunky, although static, and her two love interests are also standard Western style (blue-eyed kind cowboy & I'll-take-care-of-you boy from the West). The ending was the worst part of the book, as it ended very abruptly and will obviously be finished in a sequal. All in all this book just deserves a large yawn."
1,Read ALL ingredients,As another viewer pointed out this product contains CORN SYRUP not at all organic. In fact the only organic thing in this product is the Fig. For those of us trying to maintain a healthy organic eating lifestyle you MUST read the list of ingredients before assuming the front label is accurate. This goes for all products not at all an attack against Paul Newman products which my family does consume we enjoy their products that are truly organic.
2,They don't come in indigo for my size. Annoying.,"I have a short body size for an adult. But for my measurements they only sell dark blue. I have always liked indigo. Why not that light indigo in shorter, smaller sizes? Annoying."
2,wrangler jeans,I had to take 3 of the 5 pairs i ordered to a Seamtress to have the button hole redone. 3 Of the 5 pairs could not be unbutton to put on or when you did get it unbutton you could not get them to button back up. The button hole was to small and really not a button hole at all. ALSO the zipper does not unzip or zip up very easy. Not a very good quality at all. Will not order them from the site again. Thanks
1,Fabric is too Thin!,"After one wash and only being worn 3 times, one of the rear belt loops tore out of the fabric.Substandard fabric."
3,duh,i ordered this thinking it was an actual ebtg record... i wasn't aware of the back to mine series at the time. but i really liked it nonetheless.
4,"Tasty, especially on vinyl","Found this on vinyl at Towers SF and with the exception of only having two songs per side, it's worth the effort. Excellent production. The songs seem very fitting to those familiar to EBTG with perhaps the exception of the R&B ""Someday We'll All Be Free."" Best track is the lovely Beth Orton's ""Stars all Seem to Weep."" It grows on you. Pour a glass of scotch, turn the lights down, vacuum tubes 'a glowing, and chill."
3,Necklace,"the chain left a little to be desired, but the pendant was BEAUTIFUL and more than made up for the chain."
1,Not for Witchery fans,"I love Witchery, but this Satanic Slaughter stuff is pretty awful, really. A bunch of worthless generic black/thrash tunes, with no inspiration whatsoever . This looks like a despicable attempt to cash in on Witchery's deserved success. Get all the Witchery albums instead!"
2,"Great product, if they send the right product.","I ordered Weathertech Extreme Liners for my 2011 Tacoma DC Sport last week. I made sure that I was specific, and double checked the item description, but I ended up getting front liners for a Dodge Dakota, and rear liners for a Buick Acadia. I'm disappointed. Customer service was great, and sent me a shipping label to send the floor liners back, but come on. I got a refund and am ordering these from Autoanything.com."
4,Baxter Skin Toner is Effective,"People often complain about this product and say it is too gritty. But that abrasion is exactly what I like about it. I wet my face, and put the product in my hands and rub them together. This helps emulsify it, and it applies very nicely. It feels like a mini-facial and I love it. It takes the old skin off. I am over 40 but am often mistaken for under 30! No kidding. I know that taking care of my skin is important and it helps me to look younger. Defoliating is part of that care process. My local aesthetician dropped this product and now I have to buy it online. It is gritty but with careful application and emulsifying - it works great. Even my aestetician didn't know how old I was... :)"
1,very dissapointed!,"I'm very dissapointed with this product - it contains only 5 songs (althoug they're greate), and a 30 min interview with guys (WHO EVER NEEDED IT???). The songs were available for free on the Il Divo site! Don't buy!I feel quite cheated!!"
5,Wonderful!,The Il Divo DVD at the Colisseum is wonderful. I invited friends to watch it and we ended up watching it twice. Great DVD! (ordered from Amazon)
3,Il Divo at the Coliseum,"We enjoyed this DVD, but expected it to contain a lot more songs. It was obviously only a small portion of their concert. Why isn't the complete concert included, we wondered."
5,Awe inspiring Amazing Grace,Their rendering of Amazing Grace in the Coliseum is the best that I have ever heard.
3,Not nearly as good as I expected.,I was disappointed with his CD. It seemd to be thrown together for the Christmas season without any rhyme or reason and not nearly up t the standard set by them on their fist albums.
1,Disappointed,"I was looking forward to this CD. I was so disappointed that it didn't work on my CD players, only in Europe! There was nothing I Saw to indicate this. If Amazon is selling products to consumers that don't work in the US, there should be a notice indicating such. I am hesitant to make another CD purchase."
3,Decent album of originals and standards,"I think Don tried pretty hard with this one. It's a decent album, naturally paired with Chain Lightning with which it shares a similar feel and mix of songs. Don does a nice job here of some of the standards, like Love Hurts and Love Letters, and invents one or two of his own: I particularly like Crazy Eyes.Songs like Isn't It Strange, and the title track, are a little overblown though; the subtlety of his previous work is lost in these, but Don's tunes and lyrics are nonetheless catchy throughout.The remake of Castles in the Air is welcome too, but merely different from, not better than the original."
2,Boring,"Good theme and good material. However, the filming and the acting wasn't the best quality. The idea behind the movie was good, but I didn't even finish watching it because it just wasn't that interesting."
3,Standing Firm,"I purchased this film based on its high reviews, but was a bit disappointed. I agree with a previous comment.... the intent was fantastic - good role models and encouragement to keep praying for lost loved ones - however the movie lacked content. It did not reveal the transition and transformation process, which would have added a lot to this movie."
4,Nice,"I saw this and it was ok. Im glad that the character turned to Jesus. It shows that no matter what happens in your life, Christ is there. His grace is sufficient. Nice film about overcoming tragedy with the Love of Christ!"
1,Dissapointing,"Despite the promising title and concept the book is very dissapointing, bland and boring. It is hard to believe that Lonely Planet authors did not have more engaging stories to tell. I think Lonely Planet has lost its edge trying to be all things to all travellers. I mean who needs $300 a night hotel listings in the ""backpackers' bible""? Most of the stories in this collection are tame and uninspiring. If you are looking for ""disaster"" travel stories, check out the collection of twisted travel writing Fortune Hotel (ed. Sarah Champion) available through Amazon's UK website. That is a fantastic book!"
1,boring - a huge disapponment,"I am a regular reader and user of the Lonely Planet guidebooks for several Asian countries, and I love the way they are written and all the funny little comments and horror tales.I expected this book to be full of hilarious stories from around the world, but it isn't. Most of these stories are boring and lame. The good ones don't justify paying money for this book. Several of the stories are poorly written."
3,Mediocre,"While purportedly a collection of travel horror stories, I couldn't help but think that I've routinely had worse encounters on my trips, and I'm not exactly an LP reviewer. Some of the stories are amusing, a few shocking, but most are quite mundane. My sense is that Lonely Planet had some content that they thought they could cram through their publishing channel. Don't get me wrong, I love their guides and enjoy reading about travels, but this book is not a particularly good value. The upside is that you do get exposed to many various cultures from far-flung locales in one short book."
5,good product! ecnomic size~,"It's a super good kitchen while in-expensive oil clean product,and just make the kitchen clean job much easier nowAnd it comes this large economic size... super!"
3,smells like grandma's place,"this product didn't blow me away. we mostly got it cause it reminds us of our grandma's houses. it smells like palmolive. i think it works well, but i'm pretty neutral about it. it will probably last us a long time since it needs to be diluted a lot. i have used it on soiled wood furniture and it did its job. but it's not aromatherapeutic like mrs. meyer's clean day (my fave cleaning products ever). also, i'm iffy on supporting colgate/palmolive. wouldn't necessarily buy this again. vinegar does the same thing."
1,Yuck-o,"Product itself leaves a film on my hardwoods. Ok for cleaning wood furniture, beats Pledge and conditions better than Pine Sol. Amazon packaged it poorly though and it exploded in the box, all over the new bed sheets that I ordered at the same time---major packaging error there too. Would not buy again based on both product performance and packaging."
5,Well made traditional resource for study.,All of the publications from the Loeb Classical Library have the original texts and manuscrpts printed on the page opposite the modern translation. There are footnotes and references throughout the printed pages as well. Each book fits easily in the palm of your hand for easy storage or transport. Having your Homeric Greek or Ovidian Latin adjascent to the modern english hastens the learning curve and inspires further study.
5,Excellent service,"When the Cd arrived, I played it and found that it skipped on several tracks. I sent an email about my complaint and to my surprise I received a phone call within minutes. The individual that I spoke to assured me that I would receive another copy within a couple of weeks. I received my second copy and it plays very well. I offered to return the first Cd, but it wasn't necessary.Thank you very muchBob O'Keefe"
2,Overrated Elitist ...,"There are two or three incredible songs here, but as a whole album it mainly will just make you mad at the underground. The beats are mostly hollow sounding and Devoid of Funk. If this is the future of hip hop, as most white, hornrimmed glasses wearing, backpack wearing, art school attending ""critics"" call it, I'm gonna go back in time. Hop in the Delorean and cruise away from this one."
1,No offense but ginnie sayle is out of date,this book helps not much of anythingit was written too long ago. this is the 21th century!!!! this book was written when i was like under 10 yrs olddd!!!it says woman began to experience orgasms in the age or 30 like that's when u first starts to let urself go w/ sexhaha that's funny...i couldn't go on reading this anymore it was so.. incorrect and boring.waste of my time! like seriously
5,Excellent Product!!,"Excellent non-stick product! Highly recommend to anyone using a dryer to make""raw"", organic bars in a dehydrator."
1,DON'T BUY IT!!!,"The first time I plugged this thing in, it MELTED itself! What a horrible smell! It's all plastic and I set it up exactly as instructed and now it's just destroyed! I couldn't send it back because I don't have a printer to print the shipping label so I wasted about $40! Don't buy it!!"
2,Such Pretense,"Cinema doesn't deserve to be treated this amateurishly. I realize this is personal statement, but his disconnected use of film images and his utterly pointless narrative don't conjure any subconscious subtext or personal insights. What's the point of sitting through four hours of this? At least Italian cinema received slightly good treatment."
4,A Terse but Well Illustrated Caravaggio Volume,"Though this Harry N. Abrams 1989 monograph on Caravaggio is dated and not at all the thorough investigation of a fascinating painter's influence on the history of making and living art, Alfred Moir's CARAVAGGIO does offer an exception introduction to the painter's work. The biography is confined to the opening forty pages and contains enough of the highlights of Caravaggio's career to pique the interest. But the real pleasure of this 'old standard' book is the presentation of the color plates of many of Caravaggio's most interesting works. These are not crowded, each painting being given its own single page opposite which is a fine discussion of the painting both technically and about the subject.For a fine quick reference book for the paintings addressed in the continuing stream of biographies of Caravaggio written today, this volume is a perfect foil. Just don't expect a scholarly volume or excessive detail. Grady Harp, December 05"
2,wax refill,"While this product was fine, it was extremely expensive for the one pound that you receive. I suggest shopping around."
4,paraffin wax refill,"The wax melted just fine and it had a nice light scent,not over powering. We discovered one block wasn't enough to fill the container so purchasing more than one block is a good idea for now on."
1,The Making of a Bartimore Album Quilt,Although this book is written well I find that I expected more out of it. Would love to have larger photo's of the quilt and maybe a few patterns themselves to pick and work with.
1,Horrible,"OMG, I can't believe how bad these things taste - I tried the carmel variety and just about got sick. I took one bite, spit it out and threw the whole thing away. What a waste of money. Glad my kid likes 'em because otherwise I'd be out a bunch of money."
4,It's French,"The chorus is a film with a heart of gold. It's sweet and touching, with some great tunes. Plus it has the guy from Cinema Paradiso. A charming little movie."
5,WOWZERS!!!!!!,"WOWZES! I LOVE THIS MOVIE!!!!!!!!! i have waited for over 10 months for this movie to come out on DVD because I missed it when I was in France last year. And boy i couldnt' wait for it to come out. I was so happy when I got it, and it is SOO wonderful. Filled with beautiful music, great vocalists, and a great storyline, this movie i'd say is one of my favorites. it's AWESOME!!!!! I'm just learning french at High school, and i am still in shock that i have it! I love French and this is awesome! I truly recomend it to anybody who loves music and who loves a good storyline. its a good one...trust me. C'est magnifique!!!!!!!! Je l'aime beacoup!!!!! hehehe"
5,"Charming, Classic French story","This is a traditional French film re post WW II France and how young children were affected by the traditional French society. The acting is superb even if a bit corny, the voices and music are angelic, the story is a real tear jerker with light touches of comedy from time to time.Dialogue is French but rather simple French so perfect for a high school second or third year class. Sub-titles are pretty well done but sometimes miss the subtleties of the French culture.It has become a collector's item in our family to be shared periodically with the Grandchildren to understand more about their Granpère's roots."
4,Amazing.,"Aaron Hale is brilliant, and deserves more recognition. The song ""Another Day"" is his best. You can listen to the entire song on his Myspace profile."
3,Wrong Filter,You need to take your GE Microwave apart and measure size to be sure of what to order...I ordered these for mine(JVM1950DR1WW) because that is what is in the user's manual and they will NOT fit...Too small...Taked to GE but got no help...Found that the JX81H is what I should have orderd...Amazon took the JX81J filters back but I will be out $5 for shipping...Not filters fault but GE's...
3,Item came slightly dammaged,The item came in a bubble wrap envelope and was bent and dented when it arrived. Since it is thin metal it was easy to press back into shape. May not be fitting as well as it could because of damage but is working fine
3,Wishful Review,"Not much I can say about this group, heard them once and I think these contemporary jazz group are far better of than the other styles of performing. Even though where I reside one can't actually get to listen these kind of music. Hearing them once was enough to get a liking towards these kind of jazz band.I must say, that from what I have heard, they are neat performers, a touch of class."
4,A book for its time,"This book is one that we can turn to in fifty years to find out what we were thinking about at the end of the twentieth century. There have been few books that have ended up in this category, I don't mean best sellers (but many are) but works that make us take a good, hard look at society. This is a smart, thoughtful, and most important, non-condescending look at what it means to be a Christian in this age. I think if you are looking for answers in the book, there are very few, because it acknowledges the search for answers, not the answers. Read it for the wit, and the chance to know one of the great apologetics of our time."
5,Another Good Book,"This book is very helpful to people who are serious about reading the Bible. Some of us, myself included, are mostly 'head' people. For us, this book guides us in seeing the Bible through the heart as well as the head. Rev. Gomes lifts up some hard issues for people in the church, and with grace and graciousness, helps us to use, pehaps, a different paradigm in understanding how scripture guides our thinking on these issues. For 'heart' people, The Good Book helps in understanding how our God-given mind can help our heart in understanding what the scriptures are really saying to us today."
3,"Okay, but not a keeper.","This is a fairly good romance with amusing characters, but the plot that the author sets up never really develops. Andie and Max are very likeable as new neighbors who are immediately attracted to each other. Max pursues a reluctant Andie. Sound familiar? What bothers me is the things Ms. Gail starts and doesn't finish. Max is a retired homicide detective, but the author doesn't use this to advantage. Some intrigue at the hospital where Andie works fizzles out. There is a wimpy stalker. A deep, dark secret in Andie's former marriage that has left her so scarred, when finally revealed makes me ask: is that all? But most of all, why would a head nurse ignore a bad appendix until it becomes an emergency? And why on earth would a surgeon have wanted to carve up Andie in surgery until Max threatened him? What was that all about? In other words, the romance is amusing, but don't look for much in the way of plot."
5,I Love Popolocrois!,"I really love this game. I would highly recommend it to any RPG / Anime fan of any age. It has a good story line and awesome little movies here and there. I was a little skeptical at first. I thought it might be cheesy with not so great battle action, but I am very glad I gave it a try. The only thing I could see change is the random, pop-up battles out in the fields. But you get used to that after awhile and the quicker you move the less fighting you'll have to do between locations, so it's really not bad. I enjoyed this game very much and hope you will to!"
2,This game is horrid,"Hi I am a heavy RPG fan, and I know a good RPG when I play it. And Popolocrois is not a good game.The story line is bad. The story is, this little boy (ten yrs old) sets off on a ""Magical"" journey on a potion that will wake up his mom who has been in a ""Mysterious sleep"" for ten years. The story sounds corny, yes and it does not get any better. The game does not give good directions on where to go next.The gameplay is dull, you kill all monsters with one or two hits. This game is not turn based combat, if it was it would be halfway decent. But you fight around on this grid.The graphics are cartoonish a lil, which I like how they made the characters.So overall this game is bad, very bad. PLease dont listen to the other reviews, they are people settling for less due to the lack of RPGs on the PSP. Instead of wasting my money and time on a crappy game, I'd rather just wait for a good game."
3,"Functional, but ""cheap-looking""","I bought this same product a few years ago. Needed another one so I ordered the exact same thing. It's super functional and all that. but this version is ""cheaper"" quality than the old one. Previous version had pretty good ""pleather"" feel all the way around. The new version now has a cheaper feeling pleather for the cover/binder, and the zip lining is now cheap nylon instead of the pleather. definitely lower quality, not as nice looking. functionality still good."
4,Good Case,"i got this case to keep all of my kids WII games in.It's exactly as shown and is just the right size, saves tons of space too."
4,book,I have bought several of these books and they are really good but with this purchase I found they changed the look and handle of the product. Plus the picure does not match the product I recived they need to update info on product.
3,This case is okay,"This case is okay and takes care of a storage problem. I have two niggles: the plastic sleeves are not terribly sturdy, and the sleeves open to the side, hence the CD's tend to slide."
4,Great CD/DVD wallet,"Overall this is a great CD/DVD wallet. I can't think of much to say other than it holds plenty of media and I haven't had any problems with it yet! As someone who doesn't use a wallet like this on a daily basis, it works perfectly well for me. When I looked around for which one to buy, people had really frighteningly strong opinions about which was better...All I can say is that I'm happy with this one and would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for one."
4,case logic cd case,"The cd case i purchased turned out to be a great buy. Had some doubts on the quality of the cd case, but when it arrived i noticed it was decent quality. In all i do recommend this case."
2,"Good CD case, worlds worst zipper design.","Bought this item from a wholesale club and while it does everything a cd storage case should it has the WORST zipper of any cd case i own. The end of the zipper is sown into the case so when you try to close the case you really have to struggle to grasp it with two hands and tug & pull till you find the right angle. Believe me, after a couple of times doing this you will understand. Buy a case from another manufacturer. The headache isn't worth it."
2,Changed the product again,"The picture is not what you will receive.It looks like Case Logic is trying to do cost control at the expense of quality.The handle is about 25% as substantial as the previous version, shorter in length and secured by a rivet at each end.The zippered nylon cover seems to be as light weight as the sleeve pages.I have bought 25 - 30 of these Case Logic binders over the last few years but this will be the last. Targus has a product that costs a couple of dollars more. Case Logic seems to have the idea that someone looking to store 320 DVDs might be put off by a couple of bucks for quality. Maybe they should start an ""economy"" product line with this version or call the prior version a ""deluxe"" product."
5,Great Case,The CD case is a great way to store your old cd's without the bulk of the cases. I still like to keep the cd's so these are perfect!
3,Material seems cheap and not durable,"I've purchased Cases from Case Logic before and they have been really nice material that just seems very durable, but this case has a very thin cover and side material. Time will tell if this lasts."
1,Different version for the same item??,"I bought one of these about a year ago, and bookmarked it so I could always come back and buy a duplicate. I just received my 2nd order of this today, and it's slightly different. The handle isn't fully leather, so it's not as stiff as the original book I ordered, and when you open it, the sides feel like the vinyl version of this book, so those things really kill it for me. It's a shame. I don't feel like going through the process of shipping it back because it's not the end of the world, but what is the deal with updating a product without updating the product page?"
3,not as happy,I am not as happy with the new design...like the older much better...there was better quality in the old ones
2,Avoid this hassle,"Bought two of these because they hold so many DVDs and I wanted to rid myself of the DVD cases/clutter. I actually like the look, case seems decently sturdy and stands up by itself. Problem lies in the zipper; no matter how many CD's you have in your case it is hard to start the zipper to close it. One of the two wallets zipper already broke and now I'm looking to replace because I hate the fact that it is not zipped closed. I have spent minutes trying to get the zippers going. I would avoid this product..."
3,Great case but not what was pictured,"It would be great if the sellers of this product would in fact use a picture of the actual product instead of being lazy and grabbing whatever picture of whatever CD case they come across. This case, although rather nice for what it is, DOES NOT HAVE A HANDLE. Obviously, I'm not going to go through the trouble of returning it because a handle on the spine is not a deal-breaker. But it is a frustrating thing to have to experience, from a buyer's perspective."
1,"Half-Priced, Huh? What a Surprise. Could It Be Because It's Too Cheaply Made to Sell Well?!","The title says it all ladies and gentlemen. The exterior is not thick nor durable, the disk sleeves are easily bent and damaged, there is absolutely no place for a DVD label. It's just not worth buying."
2,POOR QUALITY,"C/L used to make sturdy with the zipper flaps made of koskin.No more! The sides are made of flimsy cheap thin Nylon and the zipper does not close the case compleatley on the top.I would estimate about an open 1/2 inch of space remains left open on the top when tring to zip the case completely.You might as well but a wallet that is all nylon, at least some other brands like Fellows have thick nylon sides.This is cheapo stuff....The price is low so is the quality - I dont like the fact that air/moisture/dirt/dust can get in the case more easily due to it not sealing up compleatly at the top of the case when zippered!!"
4,Caution: Do not read in public!,"Unless, that is, you have no problem with people shooting you strange looks...Jay Ingram writes a truly engaging study of language - one which will have you laughing out loud, and others laughing AT you. You will be unable to resist trying out the intricacies of speech Ingram highlights, and when you are caught audibly comparing the sssss to the sssshhhh sounds you'll understand what I mean.This book had me thoroughly enthralled. Since its scope is so broad, Ingram does not go into enough detail for the book to be inaccessible. Indeed, it will only ignite a curiosity and appreciation for language you never knew you had!"
1,Movie Headache of 2009,"The year 2008 had ""Cloverfield"" as the Number One Movie to Create a Banging Headache.The year 2009 has ""Gamer.""For any movie fan whose not into fanatical internet game playing, there should have been an advisory on the DVD box warning us that the movie ""Gamer"" is strictly for those who spend endless hours and days obsessed with game playing.I really wanted to like this movie. It was like watching directors like Fellini or Ken Russell or John Waters on a bad acid trip.Gotta stop and run to my pharmacy and seek something stronger than Tylynol for my poor aching head."
4,"Wasn't horrible, but could have been better...","I found this movie entertaining. I didn't have that high of expectations, and I enjoyed it more than I expected. There was a lot of sexual content that was unneeded. The last 15 minutes of the movie I found to be a bit cheesy, and rushed with very little conclusion to the overall problem. This movie would be hard to recommend to everyone, but it still easily be a flick enjoyed by some.I didn't like some of the choppy static. Stereotyping gamers was at times to the extreme: the 17 year old boy and the morbidly obese slob dipping waffles in a bowl of syrup. Ick!There's a lot that could have been rethought and done better. I was hoping for a more conclusive ending. But this movie wasn't HORRIBLE. If you're having doubts, by the trailers or reviews then maybe don't see it. But if you still have interest, you may actually be entertained."
3,Dang!,"The only reason this got a 3 rating is because Gerard Butler is so watchable. Other than that it was so predictable and few of the other actors were at their best. The performances seemed forced and wooden. And I thought Hollywood had learned that most people don't like nudity simply for the shock value. It was a poor effort and I hope we don't have to see the likes of this again. The Jason Statham ""Death Race"" was much better."
3,great action,"Good action movie. Sit back, grab a coke and some popcorn, and enjoy a decent movie without any predispositions."
1,The Lambs are silent no more!,"So as to not get overly invested in this thing, these are just some words that desparately need to be said.If our ""society"" has denegrated to this as a form of entertainment, or it this is what our children are experiencing when playing video games then we are in far more trouble than I thought!Even with the great visual definition and depth, the aesthetic in me still needs to go find a place to vomit!"
4,Brand Warfare 10 rules for building the killer brand,"Yo pienso que este libro es uno de los mejores libros que yo he leído. Una de las razones por las cuales yo considero este libro esta categoria de cuatro estrellas, es porque se ve que el autor le esta dando la oprtunidad a los lectores que tomen la ventaja de uasr las más correctas claves para el éxito y obtener una riquesa financiera, y además de eso, porque lo está dando al costo de un libro ordinario."
1,This book does not achieve mediocrity,"This book is worse than average on the topic of branding, which is a topic that is over covered and generally not well covered.Mr. D'Alessandro slanders advertising agencies as never caring about the brand or results but rather just sychophantically coveting a revenue stream. This statement is a breathtaking combination of ignorance and stupidity. Obviously an agency cannot survive without the ability to deliver results. The market makes sure of that.Don't buy this book for three reasons:1. It offers nothing new2. It should have been an article not a book. It has very little content of substance.3. It is often wrong in its conclusions, such as the importance of entertainment and emotion in advertising.The book is a hodgepodge of capricious anecdotes with little information for a serious student of branding to learn from."
3,Brand Warfare,"personally, i wasnt feeling this book all that much. it was cool to just read and to learn for school, but i wouldnt pick it up out of the blue and read it. i think hearing abou this personal experiences gets pretty boring. but, i will say that its not a HORRIBLE book, it killed time and brought be some z's at night. i would recomend the book to anyone concerned about building a brand of any type."
3,A good book if you have lots of money,"This book is good, but the experience behind it is clearly colored by managing the marketing of the John Handcock brand of life insurance products. So he talks frankly about the value of Corporate Sponsorship of Celebrities and whether it's worthwhile to try to name a sports arena after your brand.For those of use who don't have multimillion dollar marketing budget the advice was useful, but not too much of it was simply not applicable."
4,Good value for price,When we ordered these chairs we were a little concerned about the quality given the price but decided to risk it. Overall the chairs are of decent quality and go very well with our table. The chairs are shipped flat packed with adequate packaging to prevent damage to them. The assembly is very easy consisting of eight bolts and four screws. While these chairs are not designed to last a life time the quality versus the price is good.
4,Laugh All Night,"John Welter is one funny guy. He also has alot of heart, plus a brain. I never laughed so hard in a book one minute, then stopped, took a deep breath and gulped down tears the next. Doyle Coldiron, the protagonist, is a secret serviceman with a sense of humor about catching bullets for insignificant dignitaries. He falls in love with a coworker, plays midnight secret softball, and babysits a drunken diplomat, all the while exchanging the wittiest dialogue with everyone he encounters. Too bad Welter can't turn them out faster-I can't get enough of him."
4,Serious students of the Holidays phenomenon take note:,"Restad knows her stuff and doesn't hesitate to engage controversial aspects of the season. This is part of an ongoing conversation, and should be read in dialogue with the (in my mind) better book, The Battle for Christmas by Nissenbaum. However, Restad's book is an excellent one for anyone who seeks to understand the ""whys"" of the cultural traditions that bombard us. As well as get some handle on the ""hows"" of doing things differently in your own life."
5,Excellent resource,"I meant to buy this when Tom first published it, but didn't do so at the AMWA meeting, and I've been kicking myself ever since. I'm happy to have found a used copy in extremely good condition at a great price. This is an invaluable reference for anyone who edits scientific material, since the correct reporting of the statistics used is as important as any other part of the work. Thanks Amazon!"
1,you get what you pay for,"The saying is very true in this case... I picked up this on a sale from AutoZone to do some very basic work. Within couple of minutes the 1/2"" drive went free on one side soit was unusable. When I tried to use the other smaller drive with an adapter, that worked for some time before giving up... There was no way to tighten back so I had to use a wrench.I wouldn't recommend the drives although the sockets might be ok..."
4,better than the review,"I read the book in the context of one person's experience, not for a global understanding of the Vietnam war. It was a moving and informative look at the life of a person who paid a painful price for her service."
3,the comic was a reprint...,the comic was a reprint... worthless but atleast i got to read it... the action figure is pretty sweet too
1,CyberHome DVR1600 failed after less than 3 months,"I would not recommend this product. After 2 1/2 months, this player started rejecting about 40% of my DVD's. I received an error message: ""bad disk."" I can play these same DVD's on other players, so I know the problem is with this CyberHome player (CyberHome DVR1600). The CyberHome warranty policy is 1 year for parts, 3 months for labor. I still have the expense of paying postage to send it back to the company. The customer service is not good. I spent 25 minutes on hold and nobody picked up. One must go on line to get a case number in order to send the product back, and the normal wait time is 24 to 72 hours for customer service to generate this number. I regret this purchase and if I had it to do over again I would have purchased a different brand."
2,DVR 1600 MU1 - Buy it on your own risk,"I have given it two stars only because of the Cyberhome customer service. Actually, there is no customer service. Here is their message on 888 customer service number:""Thank you for calling the Cyberhome Entertainment service center. If you have any questions regarding the operation of your product, we have an extensinve knowlegde base to support you at www dot cyberhome dot com slash service. Our phone and e-mail support is currently not available.""No comments!I did not find the answer to my question at this WEB site.There is no way you can post your questions on this WEB site.There is no way you can get an RMA at this WEB site.Otherwise almost all functions worked properly for me, except for playing back the recorded DVDs on the computer. There was no sound. I can perfectly watch any other DVDs on the same PC, but not the ones recorded with Cyberhome DVR 1600 MU1. I am going to return this DVR back to the store.Good luck!"
1,"Worked, Died, unable to get support","Unlike most of the complaints here, my recorder actually worked for a while. The quality is garbage and you will find that most people won't be able to view your disks. The menu system is clunky and difficult to navigate, even after 6 months of learning the paths.The worst part of this recorder is the complete lack of support. Face it, if you buy this you are on your own if anything should happen. Their Support line tells you that they are down (how can they be ""down"" for a month?) and the web link for support doubles back on it's self.The fact is that they were first with an inexpensive recorder - so they sold a bunch of them. Now there are better brands at a better price, all available right here. Skip this one and buy a brand recorder from a company that actually support their products. At a few 4.9 pounds, this doesn't even make a good boat anchor."
4,Great Deal,"First, for the price you can't beat this recorder. I read all about the downsides of buying a recorder with no HD and still took a shot with it. Using it to record live TV is a snap. Quality is outstanding. If you use a DVD+RW , it's just like having a VHS but 100X better.Transfer of VHS Tapes just as easy.Playing of pre-recorded DVDs were no problem also. The user interface is a little complex at times, but if you read the manual + a little pratice, this can be overcomed. I had no problem with the playback of DVDs on other machines (I have two others different manufac)<br /><br />***Read manual BEFORE you buy blank DVD+R/RW There are some that don't work to well with this machine.***"
1,be careful with your money,This product worked great the first day and the second. The third day (i tape my soaps daily) it started making a loud sound and then pausing during my timed taping. I went to watch that recording and it had a noise in the background of the recording.I took it back and for $20 more bought a magnavox recorder. I hope it works better.
4,All the best in one place...,"I have been reading this book for 8 months now, and I'm still not finished......Because each time I read a new interview with a writer that I become intrigued with, I put this down & go and read that author's books.This book is outstanding. I started reading travel/adventure memoirs about three years ago, my first being ""Falling off the Map"" by Pico Iyer. Pico's in ""A Sense of Place"" as well as my other favorite, Bill Bryson. Jeff Greenwald and Redmond O'Hanlon were both new to me from this book, and I highly recommend reading their books. I also found out which author that I would be better off staying away from. (Paul Theroux) I just didn't click with his viewpoints.All of the interviews are enlightening - and I think I'm finally on the last one. I'll be sad when it's over. I really enjoyed learning about so many authors in a genre that I am just starting to sink my teeth into."
3,Track list shown on preview is incorrect,"This single consists of two audio tracks: Tears for Affairs and The Last Song. The CD also includes an alternative video for the song ""Lloyd, I'm Ready To Be Heartbroken."" The video is an mpeg file and comes in both PAL and NTSC formats. This CD single does not have the third track ""Super Trouper"" as it would seem from the listening preview shown for this CD. Do not buy this CD single if you are expecting ""Super Trouper"" to be included. It is not.I only gave this item three stars, because the product description for this CD is incorrect. Camera Obscura is a five star band, as are their great songs."
3,"Real knee sock, but thin","I had been looking for real knee socks for quite a while now. Love them in the winter with boots or to keep my lower legs warm when out in the winter snow. These fit well and are long enough to cuff, but the knit is quite thin on these. I expected a heavier weight knit. I would not order them again because of this."
2,EXPENSIVE,They might fit nice and I really do need a rayon blend sock. But $21 for ONE PAIR OF SOCKS is too Pricey!
1,YUK NASTY!,I bought this thinking it would be a good alternative to Nescafe Iced Java syrup since its no longer available and this stuff smelled weird and had a horriable aftertaste to it that made my want to puke! I will never buy this product again since its nasty!
3,Okay,Good when you photograph a lot vertical and need more energy.It's a little bulky and the pricetag slightly to high for what you get.
4,So adorable,"I bought 2 of these rain coats, one for my x-large labrador and one small for little terrier. I love how they look on the dogs & they do keep them dry. The hood is adorable!!!!!! The only problem is the elastic in the neck is tight so I have to make adjustments to loosen the elastic. My dog will not go outside to do her business in the rain at all, I really have to push her out the door. Now that we have this coat she will go out & get it done, that's after she stares at me thinking ""Are you kidding me lady"". I just love these coats & they work so very well."
3,DVD review,Interesting but not outstanding. You guys would probably get more comments on your products if you didn't have a minimum word rule!!
4,"Good assessment of social effects, bad conclusions","While reading most of this book, I felt it was a good analysis of the impact of gin on this culture. However, I believe the conclusions in the last 20 pages are wildly simplistic and badly supported."
3,Feminine spiritual writings - primarily prayers,"Like its companion book, Laughter, Silence and Shouting, this volume is a collection of feminine voices, some historical or non-Western but primarily contemporary Christian voices. Of special note are prayers of Emily Bronte, Emily Dickinson, Frances Ridley Havergal (hymn writer), Christina Rossetti, Susanna Wesley, Helen Keller ...The collection contains a wide variety of theological views - the traditional (Wesley, Underhill), the deep ""primitive"" (Grace Nichols) and the overtly feminist (Miriam Therese Winter). In addition to prayers, there are several prose excerpts and, surprisingly, some single sentence editorial comments ""explaining/justifying"" the inclusion of several items.The result is a book in which a reader will find items to love - and to hate. This is a bit to glean some favorites from and discard the rest as chaff."
3,IT WAS TERRIBLE!,"If you're into this kind of movie, well, it's probably just about what you're used to. I used to be into this kind of thing, but I don't feel it anymore. It was still watchable, and I sat all the way through it in one sitting, but this kind of movie doesn't inspire me anymore.In my opinion it wasn't over the top in gore or breasts. It really seemed like it was trying to be a legitimate movie about a disco exorcist."
2,Ugh...cheap fantasy,"Let me preface by stating that I love fantasy movies. I love the genre. To be able to escape the mundane and experience the impossible makes for a nice few hours of entertainment. This movie though...not so great. I do have to say though that the director himself stated that he opted for horse riders who can act vs. actors who can ride horses. Big difference in quality.The story was average: group of knights help village, one falls for a girl, there's a dragon somewhere, blah blah. The only saving grace for the film was the setting. My God was the setting gorgeous. Besides that pass on the film."
4,A stylish mono for a man (or woman),"This monosling bag is a pleasant ""gadget bag"" that houses my plethora of electronic devices and such with ease. It is large enough to house a netbook at extremes(though I would not recommend it due to lack of padding on the bottoms)yet small enough to hold several pdas or smaller electronic devices with it's overall girth. It is a fine traveling companion for cities and the like and stands up well to dirt and moisture. The strap itself is sturdy enough but, was unfortunately ripped fairly easily by a firm grab from one of my friends. It certainly isn't as sturdy as a bookbag strap that carries heavy books and it isn't meant to be. the materials are solid and you will not feel like a pansy(if you are a guy) if you wear it. Recommended."
4,Irony?,"I assumed since the main sponsor was an HD television manufacturer (Vizio) and the DVD is billed as ""The Official Broadcast"" (which was broadcast in HD) that this DVD would be in HD.The lack of HD video and 5.1 sound (stereo only) is disappointing. To be fair neither the listing, nor the packaging claim HD picture quality or 5.1 sound. The object the camera is focused on is clear when it's not moving too fast (i.e. NOT an Oregon player-BURN!). Everything else is grainy.While I'm disappointed with the quality, this game way too momentous and and amazing to return the DVD. 3.5 stars.[46"" Samsung edge-lit LED and a Sony BluRay 5.1 player (upconvert capable) home theater system]"
1,"An old-fashioned, dictatorial approach","I finally figured out what bothers me about this book. I want more options from which I can choose, yet Martha's approach suggests that there is only one way to do things. Wrong! I need a book that takes a broader view of decorating options."
2,disappointing...,I really like martha stewart and think she has a great style and ideas so this was a very disappointing purchase as it really brings nothing new and only covers basic things...
1,wasted my money,i just kept opening the book from one page to another the book did not go straight to the point when i think i am about to gain the chapter ends i recommend this book for college students who needs to know all definations and terms
4,Very Fun Stories,"What a light-hearted, fun book. Both stories had laugh out loud moments and very sweet romantic interludes. Very enjoyable reading."
2,"Old fashion, sappy and comfortably boring","First off the Forgetful Bride: In my opinion it was a waste of a good plot and a great male character. Cait was shallow, with no sense of humour and absolutely no imagination. The author should've made the hero ditch her so she could have an epiphany and go beg for a second chance.The second story was better in terms of characters, though I found them all a bit too proper for my tastes. That bit about a College student wanting to sing carols while cutting out paper stars to hang on a palm tree with her biker boyfriend was just too much. After 2 years at Harvard, how sheltered and naive can you be? The whole book was also very platonic. The chemistry was artificial at best. It would've been more realistic for the characters to form a historical book club, rather than get married. It felt like the couples were formed out of loneliness and desperation rather than love or even passion."
2,Another Heather Graham bomb,"I feel like all post-Austin Powers Heather Graham movies are all the same - Heather Graham's character mopes about not being able to find a guy and she wants to have a baby. I'm not sure if it's coincidence of Graham's preferences, but she always seems to play a desperate woman who seems to shed any sex appeal she had with her personality. Moreover, the movie just isn't that funny. There's only so much of sad, pathetic loser one can take before it stops being funny."
4,Very nice little speaker,"These are very nice little speakers. The mounts are very easy to use. There is a little bit of a tin sound if you play them at very loud volumes, but if you are looking for a nice sounding speaker at low to moderate volumes. These are great and they are priced fairly too!"
4,Great Quality for the price,"These speakers are a great value for the price. I paired them with the PYLE PLMRA120 Waterproof Amplifier in my FJ-40. They sound great even at highway speeds with the top off. The only thing that I think could be better is the mounting brackets. I'm sure they are fine for home/poolside (stationary) installations, but are a bit flimsey for an auto. The only reason I gave 4/5 instead of 5/5 overall rating was because of the mounting brackets."
2,"Sound is good, but bracket broke","I can only give these speakers 2 stars. The sound is fine, but the bracket, specifically the screw holder within the speaker box, broke when I tried screwing in the bracket to hold the speaker up. Because of this, I cannot hang the speaker and there appears to be no way to fix the screw holder. Thus the speaker is worthless to me now. So if you buy this, be very careful when screwing in the bracket...it breaks easily. If you get past that issue, the speakers will probably be fine.-JohnNChoose, bid and save! Join the fun at [...]!"
3,a couple of gems,"i agree in that this isn't as good as their debut - they're definitely going for a more pop/commecial sound with this record. especially on the opening track and track 6. still a zillion times better than pop/commercial music tho :)there are still some really really good mellow tunes on here, track 8 for example is pure listening bliss, on par with anything off the first album. the final track is very nicely spaced too. chilled."
2,Waiste of money,I purchased this album because of the other reviews on site such as this one. I never listen to the album because my other ones are so much better. It's not a horrible CD by any means... it's just not all that good. Parallel Life is a MUCH better album. If you like this kind of music though.. I would go with Enigma all together because it's much higher quality and flow.
4,The Perfect Stranger/Another Perfect Stranger,"Having seen the movies on satelite TV, and now viewing them in my home, they are so very good.They manage to incorporate all the angles/arguements used by many folk, in conversations that are believeable and easy to follow. Both of us found them to be moving, as we each remembered how Christ came into our lives and created a longing for our children to know him."
5,Awesome exhaust,Have this on my 02' z28 camaro and it sounds awesome. Not too loud and not raspy at all but gets loud and sounds really nice when you put the pedal to the floor. Installation was easy and only minor adjustments were needed. Tube are very heavy nice stainless steel with flawless welds. Love it
4,Great movie,"This movie and it's counterpart were both very good. I did like this one betterbecause it felt more real and emotional. I could feel the loathing from the motherfor the Lyken girl. It was suppossedly less violent but more real. They both hadreally good scenes that the other did not have, but the movie had to be more then justa bunch of violent scenes. I also was disgusted with the tone that the mother was sorryin any way. She was a brutal, horrible person that also lied about it in court. What's toforgive? Overall this was the better movie and acting, but Paula should have beenportrayed as more abusive."
2,Don't bother...,"As someone who goes to the Los Cabos area atleast once a year for the past ten years, I had a feeling that this booklet was a listing of the authors favorite places to go, not necessarily a coverage of all area eateries. Several of my favorites were not mentioned, and the hotel restuarants were skipped over, many of which are great places to go. Even at [price], I was sorry I had spent the money."
1,A Waste of Good Trees,This is probably the most sycophantic book I have ever had the displeasure to read. I strongly recommend you go elsewhere if you wish a more sober character assessment.
5,great product!!!!,I absolutely love this product!! My son is adorable in it and literally cries everytime I try to take him out of his bath! It's the perfect size for him at 8 mos and we will no doubt be using it into his first year. The non skid surface is perfect so he doesn't slip all over the place and the hot water indicator is helpful to!
1,Baby is scared of the duck!!,"My daughter is 8 months old and is petrified of the huge duck head, especially the quacking! We have tried to get her used to it but she shakes and screams every time she sees it."
4,Love this tub!,I bought this duck tub for my son who outgrew his baby tub. My son is 14 months old and fits perfectly in the tub with room to grow too. I would have given the tub 5 stars but the ducks beak doesnt squeak...it's supposed to.
3,develops spots,"Good, functional bath. Loved it until the back foam started to develop spots of mold. Maybe 10 different small spots. We used it for 11 months. Really too bad as it's a good product, but now a waste a money since we have to buy a new one. We aired it out every day, tried to clean it, but nothing helped."
4,Great but could be better,"We have twin daughters who LOVE this and I love that they can sit up and be in the bathtub. They are 10 months old so too big for a baby tub but I don't feel comfortable with the big, hard bathtub yet.My only complaint so far is that it is SO hard to fill it with water without wasting water. I have to get the correct temp and then use a bucket or container to get the water into the duck because of how wide the tail is that I end up wasting more water than I would like to. To improve the product I would ask that they make it so it can be filled with water right under the tap so that way I am not wasting water and time doing the bucket method."
5,Love this!,This duck tub has been perfect for my little boy! A great transition after his infant tub. And just the perfect size for him.
4,Great tub! Baby loves it,"Our baby loves the tub! It's comfy, she can sit up an play and it fits nicely in our tub. I'm not sure why they added the ridiculous ducky sound piece in the duck's beak, but love it aside from that dumb addition."
2,Not what I was looking for,"I bought this tub after reading all these reviews for my 9 months old daughter. Took me a while to inflate it my blowing with my mouth. It is not sturdy and my baby doesn't like that. It's not roomy enough for an infant so I doubt it will serve till 24 months, as description claims. The ""HOT"" indicator is too sensitive, even for a warm water it already alerts you that it's dangerous. Ducky's nose was quacking but only for two times we tried, then it just died. It's a whole ordeal get my daughter sit still in that tub, she gets scared of it shifting around and can't even relax back in it because she fears or fall out of it or something. I suggest buying something that is not inflating but like infant tubs, made of plastic."
4,Better than the regular hard plastic tubs,"I love this inflatable tub because once my son was able to sit up, the hard plastic tubs became useless. This allows him to actually sit and play in the tub. My only complaint about the tub is that it seems to loose air more than i'd like. I have to put a little air in it every few days, but it's worth it for my son to actual enjoy baths and save on water that it would take to fill the entire tub."
3,Strong Smell,I bought this tub because we are traveling overseas. The tub is nice and cut. My problem with this tub is the smell... This tub has a smell that does't go away easily.
2,No quality control,"I really tried hard to love this item but I had to get three of these within a month. The first one leaked very badly in both the middle sitting area and the actual duck itself. I exchanged it as defective. Amazon sent me another. The second one had a slow leak for the duck but the sitting area was perfect without leak. I had to fill the duck with air 3 times within a week so that was pretty much defective too. I hoped 3rd time would be a charm. I tried to exchange again but Amazon only allows one exchange so instead I had to return and repurchase. The third one came in and its missing the ""quack-er"" in the nose which my son loved with the previous two. Its the same exact product so they simply forgot the quack-er.I'm very disappointed but I'm going to try this third one anyway to see if this one also leaks. If it does, I'm done with this brand for good. I'm surprised to see it get such high reviews overall, am I just that unlucky?"
3,I really want to give this five stars but....,"I really would love to give this bath 5 stars, as my son LOVES this bath and loves to play in it and I feel comfortable with him playing and bathing in it as it is super soft for him in case were to fall backwards, however, after only 3 times of using it, it got a hole in it, which my husband patched, and then it got another hole. Very disappointed."
5,My Daughter Loves It!,"I bought this Ducky tub for my daughter after she out grew the sink. She is 9 months and fits perfectly. There is plenty of room to use this tub for a long time. This tub makes bath time so much fun for her. The beak quacks, which makes her giggle every time. Clean up is a breeze! You just dump out the water and a suction cup lets it dry in the regular tub. This Duck also inflates and deflates easily. Great for travel! I would recommend this tub to anyone. Bath time is so much fun!"
3,"It's okay, but.....","This tub is okay as a second tub, once your baby is able to sit up unaided. My 7 month old son loves it, the colors are nice and bright and the non slip bottom and inflated sides makes it great. I don't think it will last him till he is 2 though, as already it seems a bit small. I still love it though, it is high enough that i don't have to bend over too much like with some of the plastic tubs. The suction cup doesn't work well for me but that's okay as i leave it inflated and just turn it over to drip dry in the bath when i am done with it. The HOT indicator seems to say hot all the time, but again, no problem since i test the water temp myself anyway. All in all, for the price, it can't be beat!!!"
5,Ducky Tub a Huge Hit in 5 Households,"After we started using ours, we keep buying this cheap gift and giving it to friends with new babies. It's cool - safe - durable - and something they never really thought about. Better than that $48.00 Polo oufit they won't remember."
2,not in color,The book is in black and white. It's difficult to appreciate textile arts without being able to see any colors.
1,freakish and pretentious,"I use the words freakish and pretentious to describe this book because not only is it filled with ""the cloud"" (frenetic repeated techno-graphics used so commonly in early 90's websites) it reeks of turtleneck sweaters and black berets. The graphic design and images are distracting, at times distasteful, and on occasion, enough that I want to slap the book shut and hold it with two fingers away from me at arm's length.Some of the images scare me. Take a look at the front cover. You see the eyeball EYEing you from inside the egg? If you perhaps think that a cookbook is about how food should eat you, then maybe it's for you. Or if you want to create food and have a nice display to put next to it when you display it in a gallery, maybe this book is good choice.This is not a cookbook. It is a graphic design study with the subject of unappetizing food."
5,Awesome as expected!,I absolutely love Fullmetal Alchemist and to finally be able to complete my collection of the anime was great. I love both the original and the brotherhood but lean more towards the voice actor choices for the original. Stuck to the plot of the manga as promised and every episode makes me tingle with anticipation. Get the second half of the series and you won't be disappointed!
3,"Good, but somewhat outdated","This is an interesting introduction to artificial intelligence, but it is rather outdated. In addition, while it gives a general overview of the entire field (at least how the field stood during the writing of the book), it doesn't give as man concrete examples, or as many code examples, as an in-depth developer might want. I would recommend Russell & Norvig's Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach for the serious developer, and forego this guy."
1,A huge waste of money.,"First of all, let me just say .... I'm not a moron. I know how to read and I read the instructions and followed them to a tee. (I'm a woman) This is the biggest piece of junk and a huge waste of time. After ""painting"" for two hours I only managed to get a 2x2 foot section of wall painted and even then .... it needs a second coat. I had my husband look it over to see if maybe I put it together wrong. We re-did the whole thing and even then it just wouldn't put out enough paint to be useful. I tried changing the batteries twice ... Duracell and Energizer. No luck. I'll be cleaning it out and taking it back tomorrow. This piece of junk makes me question every product that Wagner puts out. Don't waste your time or money. Shame on me for trying to find an easy way out of painting ... turns out the old fashioned way IS the easy way. The ""good"" reviews are probably employees of Wagner. Seriously, this is worthless."
4,Very Informative,"Great content, a lot of information. Only complaint was that I noticed 1-2 typos and it seems that a book that has made it all the way to publication should have perfect grammar and spelling."
5,Awesome,It is a wonderful book. I really enjoyed it. You should read to find out what happens. When people suspect Chip as a pro how can he get out of it? Read this book to find out!!Yeah!
5,Did they Bug My House,Any of the stories in this book could have come straight from my house. Excellent read I enjoyed every word and the cd was a special bonus. I will tell everyone I know to go buy this book!
4,Love Rick and Bubba,Book was in excellent condition and i received it in a timely manner. This isn't a deep book. If you buy it for what it was meant for.... a lttle time with silliness... you will enjoy it. Especially if you like Rick & Bubba humor.
4,The Japan you didn't know about,"I initially bought this book for a class, only intending to read the assigned sections. After reading the introduction, however, I knew I was going to be reading it all. This book was very illuminating, showing me an aspect of Japan I knew very little about: its women. The contributors to this book explore all ages and classes of women in Japan and their relationship with the media, from the ""cute"" phenomenon to the representations of upperclass women in magazines. This book is not only a view of women in Japan, but also subtly reveals how our own society influences and is influenced by Japanese media."
4,Just the Beef,"I never took a course in complex variables so a professor recommended this book to me. The format is simple and straighforward. Every chapter begins with a terse exposition of the subject matter to be covered. Immediately following is a longer section of ""solved problems,"" where the theory is put into use. The final section consists of problems for the student to solve. The techniques necessary to solve these problems are covered in the earlier ""solved problems"" section. It is apparently intended as a supplementary textbook, although to me the book seems perfectly adequate by itself for self teaching. No good if you like to learn through reading alone, but for the hands-on type it is very good."
2,Not useful :(,In my opinion there were too many names in this book. Most of them were the same names but were just spelled differently. And there were a lot of girl names in the boy section and vice versa. I thought it was poorly organized and edited. I did like the front section with the name lists and categories. But overall I was really disappointed in this book. Not a good buy.
2,Didn't care for this book,If your looking for a typical name this book is has way to many different names. We just used the top 100 names in the front of the book.
5,"So far, so good","Great price.It was thinner than our old battery so I was concerned at first, but I guess they are packing more storage in smaller spaces now. After a month in the camera (turned off), there has been no noticeable dormancy drainage.I haven't tested it, but the camera is saying that there is over 240 minutes of battery life on a single charge, which I find hard to believe."
1,"NOT ""The"" Aimee Allen","Just so that the customer does not get confused, this is NOT the Aimee Allen that recorded ""I'd Start a Revolution"" (the theme to WB series ""Birds of Prey"").This Aimee Allen (with the same spelling, what a coincidence) appeared AFTER the other Aimee Allen lost her record deal and the record company killed her debut album before release.The rocker Aimee Allen is still recording as an indie, and had a song on the ""Hairspray"" soundtrack."
4,Such a simple yet fun idea!,The Munchkin Play N Pat Water Mat was purchased for use with infants that I work with at my center. They love batting at the floating objects and seem to be fascinated with the little bell that jingles inside one of the frogs! It was a great purchase!
2,Does not really accommodate 14 guage wire,"This switch does not really accommodate 14 guage speaker wire. When I tried to secure the wire, the tab that you close broke due to the size. I returned it and ordered a different brand switch."
4,"Cute, but lose shape","Overall, this is a good product. The sponges, however, do not go back to round in shape once you squeeze them. The only other drawback is that the material is a little scratchy where the screen print is painted on."
5,Temptingly hot!!,"Great love story about a unlikely beauty. She's actually smart!! He's tough, beautiful, and seductive. Made me wanna go to the dessert!! A must read and will make you want more."
1,Not my kind...,"No, not my type of book. I really hate to put this review on here with all the other wonderful reviews about it! lol; however, I guess people do need to hear from those of us that have differing opinions. I really thought I'd like it after reading IJ's 'A Magnificent Rogue' - but I was wrong. It was very slow reading & I was having a hard time staying in it then the heroine started acting extremely stupid & the hero turned into an a real jerk. I suppose I would have to say that due to his raising, he might have actually come a long way in life, but I still couldn't enjoy either the hero or the heroine. So... I can't say I'd recommend this one."
5,Incredible book!,"This is the most amazing book I've ever read. Mr. Halpin writes with amazing honesty about his experience, without whitewash or apology. The book bounces back and forth between hilarious episodes that are all the more funny because often the people around them don't get it, to the laid-bare terror of dealing with cancer in someone you love and can't imagine living without. I can't stand sentimental books, and this isn't one, and yet some of his revelations took my breath away with their poignancy and honesty. I tend to be a library borrower rather than a book buyer, but this is one to own."
5,So funny and real,"My 18 year old daughter read this book first. She kept laughing out loud as she read it so I was curious and read it next. We both loved it! It is written in a conversational style that is exactly the way we talk, too. I could totally understand Mr. Halpin's viewpoint. It was touching and interesting and funny and sad.I liked his irrevrence and point of view about the whole topic. The point of a memoir is to tell a story from your own point of view, which is exactly what Mr. Halpin did. I could also totally relate to his comments about his mom and in-laws. As a teacher myself, I hope Mr. Halpin someday writes a memoir about his teaching life. I would like to read that. I highly recommend his current book to others, it's awesome!"
1,Worried About Who?,"I went into this book thinking that it would be a mature account of what it is like to be the spouse of a woman with stage 4 cancer. I was wrong. This is an account by an immature, self absorbed spouse who is far more worried about himself than his critically ill wife. It is not about his wife's struggle with her illness, it is not about his struggle to support her; it is not even an insightful diary of one struggling in a diffcult situation.At one point, I thought that if he sobbed uncontrollably one more time, I would throw the book out the front door in frustration! When he is left to care for his daughter, he treats every encounter as an amazement as if this were someone else's child in which he is surprised to find enjoyment.If this is what passes for ""thoughtful"" or ""insightful"" revelations of a 30-something in a crisis, heaven help us.I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone."
2,ehhh--not so much,we stuck the wire out the window but it's in direct sunlight and the outside temp is completly wrong. have to tinker with the location and see if it works better in a shady area but i'm afraid it'll read to cool. The inside temp works fine. i don't really think it was worth the money.
2,updated,"wow, how quickly things change.. not long after writing that i had this for a year did the little bugger crap out on me. i am just now getting around to writing an update but i have replaced it with a slightly more expensive remote thermometer.always just had a analog thermometer but when this little inexpensive thing popped up, I couldn't pass it up. It's nothing spectactular but I've had it over a year and have had no complaints. I like the easy digital readout and how I quickly know if I should simply open my windows because it's cooler outside (I keep my inside A/C set on 75F)."
4,"Horace, not Homer","I'm really writing this because I have to respond to the reviewer who thinks the title comes from Homer. Reynolds Price wrote and read about the two lines that give the title of this collection. He cites the Latin poet, Horace and says that the English poet, A.E. Houseman translated the poem. It is beautiful but Price writes beautifully also. I like the first novel the best, I think."
5,Created a Fantasy Childs Space,My daughter put these up around the bed I bought my grand-daughter for Christmas and my grand-daughter was in awe! :-)My daughter said these were easy to apply and quite colorful and beautiful.
4,Stone Smaller,Stone was a bit smaller than I expected (wish amazon would publish in BOTH metric and inches!) but still very pretty. Color true to photo.
3,not worth it,very small made in china totally not worth 25$ try like 5$ would not reccomend it to anyone garbage thought it was bigger but its not.
3,Not very happy,"I got this for my Mom as it's her birthstone (Dec. 2). However, while the stone is very clear and bright exactly as photos. It had a small crack on top of the stone. It might not be too obvious, but it is visible to naked eyes. If I had enough time I would have requested a return, too bad It came 2 days before her birthday."
4,"Sterling Silver Blue Topaz Pendant, 18""",Bought it for the wife and she liked it. Only problems are typical ones; pendant was a little small and necklace needed replacing to avoid it breaking and losing of the pendant. Necklace is freebie and has the freebie quality.
2,If I knew then what I know know,This product was awesome for about 5 to 6 months then stopped working.If I knew it would have went out I would have got a different one. But then again it was only $13. so i guess I cant complain much. Still it was a good product till it gave out.
4,This is not a 5.25-in device,"Amazon currently lists wrong dimensions for this device. (6.4 x 5.4 x 1.4 inches) This led me to think it was sized for a 5.25-in. bay.No, its demensions are 3.9W x 3.7D x 1.0H, i.e., for a floppy disk slot.I don't find the right reader available for 5.25 in bay, so I suppose I'll buy an FD bay adapter."
1,Poor Quality,"I bought two of these. One had bent pins on the CF card slot, out of the box. I also bought two other Sabrent products, both were bad out of the box. That is 3 out of 4 products bad out of the box. They have poor quality control on this product made in China. It is cheap junk, stay away."
5,CUTE BOOK,"ILLUSTRATIONS ARE CUTE. MY NEICE WILL BE ENTERING PRESCHOOL SOON, SO BESIDES BEING A GOOD BEDTIME BOOK, IT WILL ALSO HELP WITH COUNTING, NUMBER RECOGNITION AND COLORS."
5,I loved this movie!!!!!,"I love Joshua Jackson anyway, but he just fit his part. I also like Margot Finley, because she was his girlfriend in Mighty Ducks 3. So, it is kind of like a follow-up romance. I have never watched Romeo and Juliet, but I like this movie because it ends right! I give this movie a 10!!!!!! You have got to watch this movie!"
5,One of the best toys I have ever had!,I am 9 years old and I got it when about 6 years old and I still play with it alot. I think that it is one of the best toys I have ever had! We set it up to a TV/VCR combo portable TV and it works great. I think you should buy this.
1,No longer available,"Well,The description said in stock, and ready to ship. Purchased and paid for the item and several days later my money was refunded. No explanation, nothing. I asked what happened and they said the product was no longer available.Dont believe the in-stock label..."
2,WON'T WORK WITH A 2GB SD CARD,"Sorry for the caps, but i wish i had known. I got a great deal on a 2GB SD card, right here at Amazon. I bought it because i saw that these refurbished cameras DO NOT INCLUDE an SD card.I have no idea how good the camera is. It is too old to handle the 2GB card, so i am dead in the water. Nothing in the manual or vestigial website about how large a card it WILL take.I priced a 1GB (hoping it would work) here in town and it cost twice as much as my 2GB. If that doesn't get your frustration up, ... well, then i congratulate you on being more at peace than i am.So. Not a bad price, used to be a decent brand, the manual sucks as do they all... i wish i could find out how large a card i can use. Anyone?Limited SD compatibility. It is like the betamax\vhs debacle never happened."
1,Horrible book,"Dont waste your money on this book. Terribly written and all information is known to anyone looking into painting a car. Does not cover spray tips,candys, pearls or even proper gun setup. I wish I would have seen this in a store first, it would have saved me $13."
3,"fun for little kids, and fun for hardcore collectors...","but not much fun for people in between. I find most of the Hello Kitty books overpriced, but I was lucky enough to get this one 50% last year. It's very cute & full of religion-free Christmas fun, but honestly, it's a bit dull, but makes a good gift for any Hello Kitty fan, or for little girls around 6 years old. And it comes with some punch-out ornaments so you can make your tree just as cute as the book!"
1,Not for older children older than two,This book is for two and under. There aren't a lot of words in this book. If you have a child that reads and likes Hello Kitty this isn't for them. Don't waste your money!
5,Cat LOVES it,"I wasn't too sure if my cat would like it or not, but after she sniffed it for a few seconds, she couldn't stop eating it! She loves it. She purrs and meows for it as if it's a treat! I'm super impressed and will definitely keep buying this for her once all the grass stops growing. A must for cats!"
3,Arrived in Sketchy Condition,"Like the other reviewer from February 2007, my unit arrived in sketchy condition, kind of like what you'd expect from a ""scratch & dent"" bin. Otherwise, it seems to perform as claimed, though I'm starting to realize it may not effectively wind my particular watches (3 brands). This is the 2nd ""low end"" watch winder disssapointment I've had, may have to bite the bullet yet..."
2,Watch winder came broken.,"No battery power, and came with a broken wire to motor on one side. Hade to have wire attached. Then it worked. Like most winders I don;'t think it will last more then a year."
2,Not Worth It,"This book, although well intentioned, is not worth the money. The information is so old that in one part (on organizational computer programs) my husband and I were laughing out loud because they were talking about technology from almost 20 years ago. That being said, the book does have a couple of good ideas if you can get around the rest of the 'dated' material.If you are looking for doula business advice, a much better option would be to take the Business Doula course that is offered by Childbirth International. I both read this book and took the CBI course and the CBI course is up do date - just started this year and has everything 'good' that's in this book plus tons more."
1,I do not recommend this puzzle,"5 pieces were missing, 1 piece was an extra and several pieces were broken. I will not purchase this brand of puzzle ever again."
3,Upholstery on the bench is not as pictured...,"This vanity set was shipped to me within 3 days...very prompt. Arrived and all pieces were in tact, with the exception of a few dings on the legs of the vanity. The upholstery looks NOTHING like it does in the picture. It's a mauve and gray colored rose-print. Not my taste at all, and I was kind of disappointed, as one of the reasons I purchased this set was because of the nice print on the chair and the fact that it matched my bedding. Not really a big deal though, just went to Walmart and bought fabric to re-upholster. For the money, this is a pretty decent vanity. Exactly what one would expect for 80 bucks."
3,Its a pretty piece of furniture,the drawer was broken and also the piece that it slides on was broken. Fortunately i have a handy man that could fix it but would have rather recieved it in tact.
2,"does not work in our microwave, otherwise ok","I tried putting these bowls in our microwave at 20 percent power for 10 seconds, and they started to spark and food (strawberries and green beans) had burn marks on them. The bowls are a good size, the lids snap on well, and they do fine in our dishwasher, but you may not be able to use them in the microwave - and they are clearly advertised as microwave-safe."
3,3 stars for the 3 usable bowls,"We got the old version of these for our daughter 3 years ago and wanted to get more for our new baby since they were so great. I was annoyed to see that 3 of the lids it comes with are the kind I loved.... super tight fitting. The other lid is a vented (i.e. as slits in it) lid for the microwave. First, I try not to use these bowls in the microwave because even though they're BPA free, it's still not great to microwave food in plastic. It wasn't too long ago hat we didn't know BPA was bad for us either! Second, what I loved about the lids was that I could toss the bowls in the diaper bag and not have to worry about cheerio dust getting all over the inside of the diaper bag. Vent holes = cheerio dust escape holes! Not good."
3,"Good size, ill-fitting lids","We have two sets of these for our 16 month old boy. They're a great size for sending food with him to daycare -- one filled bowl holds enough for his lunch, another for fruit, etc. However, we have found that, after several months of use, the lids to NOT fit tightly and they constantly leak. The lids are so loose on some that if I try to pick it up solely by it's lid the lid will come off. And only 3 of the lids are useful -- the fourth has vent holes for use in the microwave.In summary, these are ok for dry snacks/foods, but not so great for liquids. The lids loosen with wear to the point of not sealing at all. Still, we got enough use out of them that I feel we got our money's worth."
5,good bowls,"not as bad for you and Earth as everything else. Plus, I use one of the bowls myself for food. The lids really make the bowls convenient."
4,Great for snacks,"I use these bowls primarily as snack bowls. A little too small for a toddler meal, but great to put a snack in and love the lids to be able to cover and easily transport. Love that they are dishwasher safe, and microwave safe (although I only heat up for less than 30 seconds to be on the safe side). Stack inside eachother nicely."
3,"Ok for crackers but limited uses, IMO. (no travel, microwave)","I have had a set of these for about a year, and have found that they're fine for food storage and doling out snacks in. The lids work ok, they colors are nice.The reason I'm not raving about them is that they are pretty wide and flat, and if my toddler tries to pick them up with 1 hand, things go flying more often than not. Also, their shape makes them inconvenient for the diaper bag, so find myself usually choosing more compact containers (that fit upright in a bag) when we're on the go.My big problem with them is that I'm not keen to microwave plastic of any kind (I know they claim to be microwave safe, but it still seems like a bad idea to me), so I transfer to another container to heat-- more dirty dishes. I found a set of glass custard cups that come with lids that are only a few dollars more than this set, and I find they are much more useful for this reason."
3,A little wobbly,Three stars for one reason... wobbly. This is easily fixed by putting a few pieces of 2x4 underneath the bottom brackets near the wheels. I used the casters and when I need to move the rack I just kick the 2x4 out of the way. I find this could be an easy design fix. The casters could be improved by making them lock but all-in-all it is a good product. Easy to set up and does the job just fine. I've had it for a few days now so I'll make adjustments to this review if anything comes up.
4,It is good,It is very convenient for my family to use. The only shortatge is that the stem is not strong enough. One side is already broken by my mom.
2,Won't be using this novel anymore.,"I was hoping Maroo of the Winter Caves would be a tie in for my sixth grade class's study of humans in the Ice Age. It started well enough, but by the end of the book my students and I agreed that there was not enough character development or attention to detail to make the novel a worthwhile book for Literature Study. One of my students suggested I have future sixth graders read the novel in order to see what a undeveloped book is like."
1,just not good,"This DVD may be the worst DVD in history. Especially the special features section. I mean can you really pack a DVD with more usless information. For example there is a short called Y2K: Shutdown Detected (it should have been called Y2K: Please Shutdown your DVD player and smash this disc) You know something is wrong when your making of section is longer than your movie, they should have put a little less effort in the making of and more into the feature project then they would have something that was just awful instead of what is currently on the disc. Please for gods sakes save yourself the misery and don't watch this DVD or anything on it or near it."
4,Handy,"Easy to install and sturdy, this shelf looks nice and is big enough to hold several toiletry bottles I wanted to keep within reach of my claw foot tub."
1,Worthless,it was okay for the first month i owned it and then it just stopped working. but for the price i bought it for i should have known that it would brake down on me. just don't buy its not worth it.
1,Don't be misled,"I bought this off amazon thinking it was Felson's text in new edition. But it was very basic and has these annoying spaces for you to fill in the missing ______________. The missing word is in the margin.I returned it.It doesn't have very many images of pathology. I cannot recommend it, even for medical students. If you are a student, I would recommend you approach your radiology department for a tutorial before wasting money on this thing."
5,"Breathtaking, fantastic, and almost as good as live","I saw the Angelite choir, Huun-huur Tu, and the Moscow Arts Trio (with special guest Urna from Mongolia) perform in a small abbey in Luxemburg. I went because I love Huun-huur Tu, but I remembered the ""Mystere des voix bulgares"" record from when I was younger. The concert was utterly mesmerizing, intoxicating, invigorating, etc, etc. This CD gets close to that experience.If you can find it, the Zebra records release of the first three groups performing together is even better."
5,I DO BELIEVE IN MAGIC!!!!!!!,"I bought this single the day it was released. I saw it on the disney channel a numerous amount of times. It was originally form the disney channel original movie ""Now You See It..."" starring Alyson(Aly) she is also seen on the disney series ""Phil Of the Future"" as Kieley. I always knew she was a great actress but wanted to see what her and Amanda(A.J.) could do in singing. Following this single came ""No One"" from the Ice Princess soundtrack along with ""Walking On Sunshine"" from the Herbie: Fully Loaded soundtrack. I right away fell in love with these songs aswell. I highly reccommend this single and all the stuff Aly & A.J. put out. The videos are so cool and I love watching them. Hopefully they will make a dvd with the videos and other cool extras. This is one of the best re-makes I ever heard.Do You Beleive In Magic(Single)- 10 starsNo One(Ice Princess soundtrack)- 10 starsWalking On sunshine(Herbie:Fully Loaded soundtrack)- 10 starsInto The Rush(album)- 20 stars"
4,Decent Guide,"I used this, along with resources on the internet, to plan a couple of day hikes to Grand Staircase National Monument last year. It seemed to be a decent guide and helped us pick out a nice hike in Lick Wash. I don't generally use guide books on the hike itself and I always refer to resources on the web as well, so I might not be best person to review this. If you are just trying to decide where to hike and figure out what options you have in the are you are in, I would recommend this book. (The Monument covers a pretty large area - we were staying in Page, AZ, so we stuck to the southermost hikes). I just wish we had more time to hike the area while we were there."
4,Camera Work Needs a Little Work,"At first, the camera was a little dizzy, but either you get used to it or the cameramen get better. This DVD is just amazing. The concert rocked and the bonus features were awesome. The audio was really good for it being a live concert too. It was definately worth my money. Rock on Cheap Trick!"
2,Ignores Important Facts,"While relationships between America and France aren't the greatest, they are nowhere near as bad as this author says. What about Montesquieu, Voltaire, and Rousseau? These three frenchmen's ideas and writings played a big part in writing many important U.S. documents like the Declaration of Independence and the U.S. Constitution."
1,Surprised at the high reviews,I was terribly bored by this CD. The Foster-esque production and same pop-style songs wore very quickly.
1,save your money,"amateurish production. Does not to justice to Mr. Josephs' piano playing abilities. He is drowned out by ""boom box"" bass, drums and back-ground music. The end result is a cross between noise and music."
5,Pressman Triominoes in Tin,"This is a great game. We were introduced to it by friends who had a travel version - very basic, cheap plastic. We liked the game so much, we looked for a better quality version - and of course Amazon.com had several to pick from. We liked the tin this came in and the better quality triomino pieces that were solid and remind you of ivory. Delivery was fast and the product is super. We bought 2 - one for us and one for my wife's sister. When my brother from Colorado visited, they liked it so much, we bought 2 more and had them shipped to him. Great new version of dominoes."
5,Great for practicing addition/subrtaction with kids!,"Our family received this for Christmas and it has been a big hit! The game moves quickly for the most part, and you can start/stop at almost any time. It is fun to play with just adults, and even more fun with young children. Our 6 yr old has learned to add & subtract numbers quickly using this game (we make everyone figure our their own score). We have been playing a quick game right after dinner almost every night of the week!"
3,Okay...,It hangs almost too low to the ground and sometimes it seems like it takes up too much space. Also I didnt realize that I can't hang dresses on it!
5,Recommended Reading for Married and Singles Alike,"This is one of the few books I have purchased this year that completely deviated from my expectation. Treat Your Man Like A V.I.P. provides the reader with the right blend of realism and romanticism. I'm not sure why the author chose to target married women, because there are so many singles that can benefit from her insight into the minds of men. Reading Xxavier's book has given me a clearer understanding of what kind of mate I desire to be and has provided me with a guide for getting there."
5,Makes me believe in capital punishment more than ever,Anyone who opposes the death penalty should read this book.Why the people who committed this crime are still drawing breath is beyond my comprehension.
5,Where's the justice for the victims?,"A case of cruel and unusual punishment. But not of the killers - of the family and loved ones of the victim. A murder, an investigation, a trial, followed by death sentences. But then no relief for the family of a woman who was brutally murdered. Years of appeals, challenges to the death penalty. A governor who spends his last days in office letting violent prisoners out.The young mother was murdered in 1977. In the 1990s, the family is still being tormented, waiting to hear if a new trial will be granted. One of the authors is the victim's aunt. I Googled the case to see what became of it. The victim's husband, originally sentenced to death, had a parole hearing in 2007. Thirty years after the crime, the family still not granted any peace, but instead having to attend a parole hearing to keep this monster in jail!"
4,"Very good collection of Abida, though not her best of works","A nice collection of songs--mostly spiritual Sufi--are collected on this CD. Virtually all the songs on this one are in Sriaki or Punjabi--whereas most of her best songs are in Sindhi. A good collection, nonetheless.-Abro"
1,BAD CAM BUT GOOD FOR KIDS,"I GOT THIS CAM WHEN I WAS ABOUT 10, ME AND MY FRIENDS MADE STOP MOTIONVIDEOS, IT WORKS GOOD FOR KIDS BUT IF YOU NEED IT FOR MOST OTHER THINGSGET A BETTER CAM"
4,Alot of Music for a Single,"Not a bad little single. The two remixes of ""Vulcan"" are worth the money."
4,Did what I needed it to do,"This antenna gave our home wireless network the boost it needed. Upstairs or downstairs our three desktop systems vary between ""very good"" and ""excellent"" connections. Our adapters are all pf the ""B"" specification as we largely only use the network for internet connectivity. It is connected to the Linksys Compact Wireless-G Broadband Router (WRT54GC) which was also purchased here at Amazon because I wanted a smaller footprint, and B routers are no longer available. Four stars instead of five for a small matter. The antenna has to be positioned off vertical (tilted out from the router) for best connection, so it looks a bit funky on the wall."
1,Antenna doesn't meet expectations,The Antenna does not appear to add any range whatsoever to my wireless network. I still can't get reception more than 40 ft. away. What a disappointment :(
4,"Some Improvement, But Worth The Money?",Only buy this item if you are willing to pay a lot and get a little.
1,YOU DONT GET WHAT YOU BUY,"I BOUGHT THIS ANTENNA FROM ANOTHER PROVIDER WITH A BETTER PRICE... I RECEIVED A DIFFERENT PRODUCT, USELESS AND NOT LINKSYS, THIS PRODUCT WAS SOLD BY WIFI WORLD, DONT BUY THIS PRODUCT FROM THIS MERCHANT, IS NOT LINKSYS. PLEASE TAKE NOTE OF THIS BECAUSE THIS STORE IS OFFERING LINKSYS PRODUCTS AND THEY ARE SENDING CHEAP PRODUCTS TO FINAL CUSTOMERS.PAY MORE AND GET THE ORIGINAL ONE."
3,"Works, kind of.",Bought this for my girlfriend. Worked great for the first day. After that though it will only work when it is not plugged into a surge protector.
4,Ornament Light Control,"We really like the convenience of the device, but the top of the ornament had to be trimmed to accept the control wire connection, the ornament tab was larger than the connector."
4,Culloden DVD,I saw Culloden when I was kid and really liked it. This is the first time I've seen it in almost 40 years and it was better than I remember. There was a delivery hiccup but it was a problem at the post office and not with the vendor. Thanks!
1,"Imaginative, but unreadable","While as an elementary music teacher and college piano professor I can appreciate O'Brien's love for pop music and his vast knowledge of it, I found the book to be unreadable. Imaginative writing does not include incomprehensible stream-of-consciousness lists of associations and trivia...I tried repeatedly to slog through it, but found it profoundly dull. And it's no small trick to make the Beach Boys and Beatles insipid."
3,It's OK,This book was OK because it wasn't really touching like the Andalite Chronicles and it wasn't really exciting like Megamorphs 2. I don't like David the new Animorph because he's a coward and doesn't have the stuff a person needs to be an Animorph.
4,Introducing David,"This book, Animorphs #20, is one of the better Animorph books. This is due in part to the plot elements, and the rest to K.A.A's (and ghostwriters') usual excellent writing style. This is the first in a separate ""subseries"": a trilogy within the normal Animorphs series. Marco, the narrator, discovers that a kid at school, David, has discovered the blue morphing cube which gave the Animorphs their powers. Now, the Animorphs must get it back before the Yeerks fimd out! The suspense is high in this book; if you are going to buy it, make sure you will be able to read the next two soon after."
1,"Okay, but confusing (And STUPID IN A WAY)","Here's the deal: the Animorphs give David the power to morph. I think that David is a JERK. He killed a crow for, no reason, disobeyed Jake, almost gave the Animorphs away, and is JUST A JERK!!!!!! I hope that everyone agrees with me. Anyway, I love the Animorphs. But this book had like, two funny parts in it (which, by the way, were hilarious). This book is confusing and basically boring during the helicopter."
4,World Atlas,I received the atlas in a short amount of time. It made it quite nice since I was started school soon.
2,Not well designed,"Yes this allows one to exercise creativity in card design, but it is not user-friendly. I felt that it was necessary to punch out the shapes first because it is not easy to see what the shapes are because the background paper is the same pattern as the shapes. However It takes so long to punch out the paper shapes that it just leaves one feeling frustrated and sick of the toy before you even start, the glueing process is a pain also. The papers are not of a pretty texture and appearance either. finally, the card stock that you glue the shapes onto says in a very visible location ""[...]"". I do not appreciate having their advertisement on the card stock, especially when it detracts from the appearance of the cards."
3,Encyclopedia of Rhythm & Blues and Doo-Wop Vocal Groups,"A lot of excellent information, but too many little known, obscure groups not listed."
1,do not buy it if you have a powerbook,"You'll not find it in their (false) advertisements or website but this unit requires an external power supply. So you pay a premium for portability that in fact is nonfunctioning. And the helpline is wortheless: after a 20 minute wait, I was told told it was the fault of my PowerBook G4 - rather than the fact that the WD passport is non-compliant with the USB power standard. WD's solution? Send a power cord - that is back-ordered, with no estimated time of arrival. Nice job, WD."
2,Works on my laptop but not on desktop,"I swear, I have been working on this ""plug and play"" hard drive ALL DAY and now after investigating on Western Digital's website I see that the desktop USB port likely does not have enough power for it. So, I need to buy a power supply for it or just get another hard drive altogether. Which is probably what I will do. The cable it comes with is WAY too short. So, if this was for my laptop it would be great, but it's not."
5,The Best Laid Plans...,"It isn't often that an author can get so completly into the mind of the person he's writing about. But in this case Flacco did just that. The reader gets to know Peernock over time and it isn't long before he begins to ask how can one man be so callous, so uncaring? Flacco does an excellent job in answering those questions even though there really isn't any good answer. To probe the mind of a man like Peernock is an overwhelming task but Anthony Falcco was up the job, we got to know Peernock. At the same time, throughout the book the reader is compelled to scream at Claire and Natasha to run, as far and as fast as they can! More Anthony, we want more!"
2,Review For Lisa Goldstein Fans,"Isabel Glass is a pseudonym of Lisa Goldstein. I've been a fan of Lisa Goldstein's work for many years and have read all of her books. I never would have known that she published a couple books under a different name but for the fact that she acknowledged this on her website. Relative to the quality of work that her fans could normally expect, this book is horrible. The characters are 2 dimensional and turn this way and that as the plot dictates. If you are not a fan of this genre you will find this book ridiculous. There seems to be one reason for publishing this - she needs the money. I have no problem with that, but by acknowledging that she is the author she has endorsed them to her fans, most of whom will not be impressed. TO ISABEL GLASS READERS: If you enjoyed this book I suggest you read some of Goldstein's other books, like Tourists or Travellers In Magic. There's a whole lot there for you."
5,Great Gloves for road bicycling.,I just washed these gloves again and realized I bought these back in 2009. They are like new! They are great for road cycling in the summer; cool and comfortable. These are REALLY a great value. Big ups.
3,"Good gloves, not for me...","I bought these thinking that some extra padding and protection for my hands would be nice since they're always a little red and dirty after a long ride.I have big hands (I'm a woman), but the medium size gloves are still too big for me. I was hoping the cotton tops would shrink once I got them wet, but after a little time using these I've found that they make my thumbs and the heels of my hands go numb. I have no problem with numbness without the gloves.I was disappointed, but not with quality or price which were actually quite good. I'm going to give these to someone who can use them."
2,Low Quality Video Tape,"The video plays like a copy from a copy. Poor picture quality and sound. I own other Cabin Fever original video tapes, and this one is not original. I was not pleased and should have returned it when I had the opportunity."
2,Survival of the fittest Sea Monkey,"...I recently purchased this product. I followed all of the enclosed instructions and many sea monkeys did indeed hatch (over fifty). However two weeks later, I returned home to find that all but one had passed on. The instructions included in my ""Magicquarium"" package said nothing of aerating the tank. Perhaps this caused their early demise. The cause of their deaths remains unknown but be aware that the instructions provided may not be sufficient information with which one may raise healthy sea monkeys."
5,New Bosch Alternator,Exact new replacement alternator fit perfect and was cheaper than a rebuilt unit from a local store. This is my first purchase of auto parts from Amazon and everything worked perfect.
1,Error Filled,"Credibility was lost on page 10, Fact 22 Abraham Lincoln. Abraham Lincoln (no middle name) was born on February 12, 1809, the second child to Thomas Lincoln and Nancy Lincoln (née Hanks), in a one-room log cabin on the Sinking Spring Farm in southeast Hardin County, Kentucky. How could this fact slip by the proofreaders I'll never know. I had to lay the book on the shelf to collect dust for a while before I could pick it up again. Illinois proudly calls itself the ""Land of Lincoln."" However, Kentucky, just as proudly proclaims herself ""The Birthplace of Lincoln."" And, FYI: Kentucky happens to be the birthplace of Jefferson Davis as well."
1,HOOKER DID NOT COURT THE HOOKERS,"ANY HISTORIAN WHO CONFUSES THE NAME OF A GREAT GENERAL WITH THE ANCIENT PLYING OF HUMAN FLESH, AKA, HOOKERS, SHOULD BE FIRED FROM HIS POST AND REDUCED TO THE ENGAGEMENT WITH SADAM HUSSEIN. PERHAPS THE CONTEMPORY WORLD WOULD BETTER SUIT HIS KNOWLEDGE BASE."
5,One of the best,"The first time I heard this album was through my father. Each day, after his day at work, he would go into his room and play a vinyl record. When he played this one, I fell in love with the music. It is phenominal and worth every penny.If you are a music lover, you will definitely enjoy this beautiful presentation from a legend ... Earl Grant."
3,ok for younger kids,"The toy is very much a toy, do not expect professional results, but it is quick and easy to use for a child."
3,Not Horowitz at his best,"Sadly, I have to remark that this is not Horowitz at its best. Yes, the ""Horowitzian energy"" can be found within each tracks, but in order to induce this energy, Horowitz has sarcrifised clarity, tonal quality and balance, this goes especially for the 2nd disc. NEVERTHELESS, this disc has jewels amoung a few ""rubble"", and should be appreciated by all Horowitz fans or people who wants a taste of Horowitz's power. However, if you want Horowitz at its best, buy the recently released studio recording Horowitz made during the height of his career (1960s) or his legendary concerto recordings."
3,Not as good as I was hoping....,Hmmm...why ddidn't this one work for me? The focus is off and the characterizations lack depth; the story shifts around too much.But what amazing promise Goodman shows. And what joy for the reader that she worked hard and got better!
2,Where is the plot?,"This book fell very flat for me. This has nothing to do with the Jewish themes (I love Roth and Singer) but rather with the fact that there is no sense of plot in the first 88 pages at all (that's where I threw in the towel). This is an example of one of those books that tries to be two things at once but successfully accomplishes neither. First, is this a novel or a short story collection? One reviewer calls it a collection; another calls it a novel. The fact that each chapter was published as its own story either in The New Yorker or Commentary shows that this is a patched together collection of short stories trying to pass as a novel. This led to me feeling cheated. Is the writer just trying to get the most ""bang"" for her buck? I felt no ""pull"" toward the characters at all and--for the life of me--I could not understand the favorable review snippets on the front pages and back cover. I sense these reviewers were friends of the author. Definitely pass this up."
2,frustrating,i will say this book is well written and intense but very very frustrating. The hero believed the heroine was guilty of fraud until the last few pages of the book. If you love someone you trust them and believe them. The hero didn't even try to listen to her or investigate further. She was pretty much a doormat and would fall into bed with the hero all the time knowing how he felt she was a gold digging tramp. He only believed her at the end because the guilty parties were caught. She wasn't even mad that this is what it took for him to believe her. The hero's actions of not believing her didn't ring true for someone that claimed to love her all along. Way too much misunderstanding that could have been cleared up if heroine tried harder to explain and hero tried to listen and believe.
3,Okay ghost story,"Harry and Alex arrive at camp Spirit Moon, where the other campers play jokes on them and try to scare them. But the jokes turn scary when a girl sticks her arm into the camp fire and a boy put a fork through his neck.It's an okay read. I had sort of expected more but it's not bad."
3,Ghost Camp Gooooodness,"I just read R.L. Stine's Goosebumps Ghost Camp.I liked this book because during the suspenseful parts, they use alot of adjectives, such as cold, and tense. They also made it so that the beginning is simple and average, when the ending is unusual and weird. And the characters were also truely detailed with a lot of thought. This is my review, I hoped you liked it."
5,The best book for raising children,"The book was great!! I think people don't like the book because it causes them to look at what they're doing wrong as a parent. I recommend this book to all my friends. I read the book five years ago, and I have good kids. I even took in a troubled teen, and it worked with her as well as my own. She turned out great. I would pray before I would listen to all the negative advice. Read for yourself!!!"
1,What a claim!,"What I would like to say is that the Bible is silent about most of the material discussed in this book. The Bible teaches that we need godly wisdom in applying its principles, not someone to write a legalistic ""how to"" manual. Don't take it as ""gospel""!"
3,Just a note,"This item is not compatible with the GMini XS200, Archos' site mentions this in their product listing but Amazon seems to have missed it."
3,REMIXED 4 THE BEST,"AS MANY PEOPLE THINK THIS IS A REMAKE,I THINK IT'S NOT. YOU CAN PLAY AS ONE OF MANY YOSHI'S,AND TEAM UP WITH BABY,MARIO,PEACH,D.K.,WARIO,AND BOWSER TO RESCUE BABY LUIGI FROM KAMEK.EACH BABY HAS A UNIQUIE SKILL TO GET YOU PAST OBSTACLES.WITH 5 WORLDS TO CONQOR THE FUN IS LIMITLESS.TAKE DOWN KAMEK,BOWSER,AND A CERTAIN TRAITOR TO RESCUE ALL THE BABIES."
2,Why did Amazon recommend me this title?,"I bought this game years ago and it was one of the worst games I have ever played. I am only writing this review now because Amazon sent me an e-mail recommending it.This game is just terrible, an insult to the legacy of Yoshi's Island. It is best summarized by probably its biggest issue: this game uses both screens of the DS for gameplay, but the space BETWEEN the screens is also used, meaning that there is a blind spot in the VERY CENTER of the gameplay. It is nothing but frustration when you keep getting hit by enemies that come out of nowhere from that blind spot, and especially when you play the levels with moving platforms you find yourself being force to play with your character in that blind spot.Any platformer that thinks it's okay for your character to be invisible knows nothing about good platforming.I also remember disliking the bosses, but it's been so long that I can't quite remember why."
2,PIECE OF S...,"Cheap is the way to describe this...even the dog wont go near it. Insubstantial filling, so dog may as well just sleep on the floor. Otherwise a very good transaction with dealer"
1,I just didn't like it.,"I've been buying Latin music since about 1980. I'm from New Zealand so Latin music was very hard to come by but I imported heaps and have over 1000cds mostly Latin.I've got everyone and I know what I like and what I don't.I bought Olga - Te Acordaras De Mi and really liked it but I have a feeling that it didn't represent the true original Olga.I bought this Live album, and thought it was ....well just not my cup of tea. I'm sure the true Olga fans love it but I just didn't like it."
4,A lighter Starflyer 59,"I own two Starflyer 59 albums right now: this one, and Gold. In comparison, Gold is definitely the better album, so if you don't have it, I'm gonna go ahead and recommend that first.Starflyer 59 began with a darker sound, ""walls of feedback"" if you wanna call it that. On this album (and judging by the reviews, also on Fashion Focus?) they show a more lighter, poppier sound. Sometimes they pull it off great, as shown by 'Play The C Chord'. This song probably warrants the purchase of the entire album on its own, it is just that good. The rest of the songs...meh. They have good qualities, but don't reach the same point as 'Play The C Chord' does.Other great songs are '20 Dollar Bills', 'My Name', 'No More Shows', and 'Going Places'. It was a good effort uhh I guess, but I still recommend their earlier stuff first before getting this album."
4,Assembly not as easy as I had hoped,"The puzzle is very colorful with big sturdy pieces. My only issue with the puzzle was the lack of interlocking pieces. It made it difficult to keep the puzzle together while working on it since straight edges just lay next to each other. A careless move would cause it to come apart. Only the outer frame is stable. We still enjoyed the puzzle and discussing the state names, birds and flowers."
3,Annoying music!!,"My daughter got this Tumble Time Tigger as a present from the grandparents. Yep, it's cute. Yep, it does tumble (once you remove the strip). But, oh my gosh, the music and Tigger's talking is extremely annoying. If I hear him say one more time ""I can whoop dee doo"" or ""tigger-ific"", I will get a sledgehammer and break Tigger into a million pieces. Surely the Fisher Price people could have thought of something better for Tigger to say. And surely they could have picked a better song than MC Hammer's Can't Touch This (or is it Rick James' Superfreak?).Overall, a nice toy, but consider yourself warned about the annoying music and sayings."
2,"I think Tigger is getting returned (or will be a ""bottom of the toybox"" toy)","I had low expectations for this toy but my 3 year old wanted it so much that we bought it for him this Christmas. I knew he probably wouldn't work properly. We removed the battery tag and he tumbles quite well. However, he does not respond in any way to clapping. It is very disappointing that he just doesn't work like he should. Why pay money for something that only provides a little bit of fun and happiness when the product can't even work right?Christmas was a bit over a week ago and though he likes Tigger he never plays with him. Definetly do not pay more than $25 for this item!"
1,Tumble time Tigger is a Flop,"My son owns a lot of Tiggers toys as tigger is his favorite. But the Tumble time Tigger was a complete waiste of time and money. We bought him and tried him out and returned him the next day for a full refund. The Tumble time Tigger doesn't tumble at all no matter the surface you use it on or how loud you clap and chant. We tried it on the counter, table, hard floor, and carpet. In the end he always flopped over on it's side like a fish on land. We tried clapping and cheering for the toy as advertised and nothing but a big flop. Honestly if three people clapping and cheering for it at the same time isn't loud enough to get it to work. It doesn't work like it should and you can forget a small child being able to operate it. It's my opinion that the Tumble time Tigger is a waiste in time and money. Not recommended."
4,Excellent guide for your first warehouse implementation,"My experience has been in project management and data modeling. This book was an excellent source of information for project management issues, lifecycle concerns and warehousing particulars.With a background in logical data modeling (with its normalization and entity-focused approach), I was able to utilize this book very effectively in the implementation of my first ""true"" data warehouse (as opposed to the ""faux"" warehouses that the customer labeled as such simply because of the large number of entities in the RDBMS). The conceptual difference between logical modeling and data warehousing was well explained, with numerous pertinent examples. The full SDLC for the warehouse is covered equally as well.A note on my ""4-star"" rating: I'm reserving 5 stars for the book I write! This book is a good value."
5,The best book for DW project manager,"I must say - this is number 1 for DW project manager. I wish i had this book for 3 years, then my success in this field could be much, much bigger. But anyway, i will recommend for new project managers only this one. I have lot of DW book at home, but there is no better choice."
1,Very difficult to read,I find this book very difficult to read and understand. It tells you a great deal about what you're supposed to do to build a warehouse but does not tell you how to do it.
5,Excelent,"I've been involved in a DW project and began searching books about DW. I take a lot of time to find this , and finaly think that I no made a mistake. It covers all aspects of DW with samples and recomendations. It's the best in that topic."
3,"Not very easy to read, but extremely important to the understanding of the military instituition.","This is a book that the casual reader will find boring and tiresome to read. Even so, this book is fundamental for the understanding of the military institution. Written by a participant in the Napoleonic campaigns it attempts to explain the Napoleon phenomena in rational terms exploring the organization and logistics of the Napoleonic armies. While Clausewitz explores the psychology and the reason in war, Jomini explores the more mundane aspects. Both are essential for understanding the military organization and thinking, but Jomini served as the basic framework for the organization of all major modern armed forces in the late XIX and XX Centuries. Anyone interested in studying the military organization has to start by reading this book. Unfortunately not many military have read it, but they should."
5,A Brilliant Book!,"This is the book I've been waiting for - a brilliant synthesis of science, medicine and healing, philosophy, and spiritual thought. The author does a great job of weaving together what previously were thought to be disparate and unrelated topics, and fully explains the shortcomings of our modern scientific approach and how we can easily overcome it. This is a book that is on the cutting edge of understanding and explaining how we can use more of our human potential, and it should be read by every adult in this country."
1,Beware!!,"This tank is not good for goldfish!! We have gone through 2 and they both died gasping for oxygen within 2 days. This tank does not provide enough surface area for the fish to get oxygen. We learned the hard way. Plus, it was hard explaing to our 4yr old."
2,Not what was described...,"I love the theme of this aquarium, hence why I purchased it; however, it stated in the description (and appears that way in the picture) that the space craft lid had a light in it. It does not. It would have added a neat touch to the ambiance of the product."
1,Cruel and inhumane!,"This product is cruel and inhumane! A lot of people stick bettas in tiny bowls like this, which is horrible! A 1/2 gallon bowl IS NOT enough room for any fish. Bettas need at least 1 gallon, the very least. You can buy a 2.5 gallon Minibow tank with a filter and light for under $30 most places, and get a small 7.5 watt heater for around 10. Just because you see bettas living in tiny cups and horrible water in pet stores, does not mean you should continue to torture the poor fish. Bettas in particular need warm water, and if you live in a cold climate there is no way to heat this tiny thing. If you buy this and torture a fish in it, your fish will be listless and likely not live very long. Take my advice and DO NOT purchase this product."
3,Better photos would have made buy easier,"I love the JLO brand and when I saw this top on sale I went for it. I got it in grey and it bothers me a bit that the description only shows photos of the item in pink. It was hard to imagine it in grey and I have to say I think there are some important differences from the pink photos than of they grey I got. I can still recommend this top if you find it on sale, but for original price of $28 I think is a bit too expensive compared to quality."
2,Fat Facts and Fat Z's,"Greg Critser, author if Fat Land, did a great job with his research. In Fat Land, Critser, explores the political, medical and social aspects of how Americans became the Fattest people on earth."
1,With the Fat Went Our Memory,"Well, the future of journalism is here. The author walks in to take a bow for having figured out a puzzle he made for himself. What he doesn't mention, and most of us are so unconscious, we don't know, is that there is nothing new here. Author's guide: find someone to blame, and make lists, short ones. Oh supersizing is an important contributor? You're kidding! I have read at least 10 articles about that in everything from Nutrition Action to searing journalistic tracts like Self.What is done here, that wasn't done in those pieces, is the story has been reduced to cartoon, complete with a villain (Earl Butz). And as the New York Times review points out: the irony is that after playing the conspiracy card, the ending makes a plea for a simple solution: the fat people need to eat less. Wonder if the publishers got to the author or if the need to conclude just elicited this saccharin bromide."
4,Good Book,This is a great book about the both the cultural and political influences in the US that helped to create the culture of indulgence that exists in the US. Good book.
3,Not Exactly News,"This book details a variety of reasons for America's obesity epidemic, including the overuse of high-fructose corn syrup, increase in size and availability of junk food, and a decreased value on physical education in public schools.Nothing Critser says is exactly earth-shattering and, like many others who have addressed this same issue, he presents the problems without proposing any new solutions. Critser describes ways some fast food restaurants are trying to include healthier foods, but dismisses that largely as a marketing ploy. He also describes ways in which some public schools have begun to reform their food programs and increase their physical education programs. These examples, however, are few and far between.The overall tone of this book was one of hopelessness. I think by now we all know that obesity is a problem. It would be nice to read a book that has some innovative ideas for fixing it, rather than another one simply exposing the causes."
4,Diet book,A good history lesson that is interesting and a fast read. A basic look at how kids and adults can get fat without knowing the makeup of the foods we consume. An eye opener.
4,Supersized Read,"I felt guilty sitting on the couch reading this book. So I upped my cardiovascular workouts and began weight training. Then I questioned the food I put into my mouth. Will this book change your life like it did for me? Probably not, but it will empower you to question what goes into your tummy. Critser collects a wide range of facts, anecdotes, and myths about sugars, sodas, and fast food. In the end, you'll wonder if it's all really bad for you or if you've just been making bad choices."
4,Use Carefully,"Attractive Attributes:Small and lightweight; easily fits in your hand. Comes with a nice, padded, snap-closure carry case.Limitations:1) This drive is formatted with FAT32. If you wish to reformat it with NTFS, you will need to do so on a computer that has Windows XP. Windows 2000 is unable to reformat it. 2) Though it doesn't get dangerously hot, I'm uncomfortable with the temperature that it reaches, knowing that heat shortens the life of anything electronic. This thing needs air circulation like a regular hard drive. 3) The padded carry case does not include a spot to carry the USB cable along with it.Conclusion:I think that this can be a good and useful drive that will last a long time, if you are selective about where it is used, how often, and under what circumstances."
3,Fresh and Promising,"Jonna Turner's book combines the style of Nancy Drew, the angst of afternoon television soaps, the fantasy of a bored traveller in Memphis, and a good but incredulous plot to provide a couple hours of fast read entertainment. Her main character Jeagan is refreshingly unpretentious and so naive, that an aspiring Agathe Christie or Nancy Drew will find him or herself at home in her shoes. Here is a character more concerned about matching her outfits than analyzing her clues. Still Jonna Turner is a fresh and promising author."
3,Nothing special,"It does brush out a lot of hair, but it doesn't reduce the shedding. I expected after all of the hair that came out for my dog not to continue shedding immediately after."
5,"It works, cat is happy","Really works. My cat is shorthaired, yet after first round of brushing I had a small bag of brushed-out fur. Cat seems to like it too.I bought the biggest one, but for my average-sized cat I could have used medium size."
1,THIS ITEM IS USED and DIRTY-----NOT NEW!!!,"When I received this item, it was USED and DIRTY! It was put back into it's original packaging that was all torn up and hadn't even been cleaned. There is moisture on the razor itself and hair inside the package! The thing is disgusting! NOT WORTH THE 20 BUCKS!!!!"
2,Doesn't work as well as I'd hoped.,"Not sure if I'm doing something wrong, but this tool doesn't seem to work as well as my regular old brush or my tool for getting under fur. Teeth seem too fine for my dog."
3,I'm feeling a little letdown,"It just didn't live up to the hype for me.I'm not sure what I was expecting, but so far, the furminator has not lived up to its miracle-tool billing. Yes, it removes some hair, but on our thick-haired newfoundland it is quite difficult to use. On a breed like this, if you have put in the amount prep-work (washing, pre-brushing with other tools) to get the furminator to work, there's not a whole lot left to do.Our dog spends a great deal of time playing outside and as-such tends to collect misc. things in her hair. She's not a yard dog, and she's anything but neglected. A tool that's third in line behind two or three other combs/brushes simply isn't of much use to us.For a thinner-haired dog I could definitely see the value. For dogs with a really thick undercoat... I hope you have a lot of time on your hands."
4,"great, but not for me","this is a great product-no doubt about it. for me, however, it was a waste. my dog has odd silky/kinky hair and it wouldn't go through his at all. i tried it on my long-haired cat and it was fabulous. the only drawback to that was that he is an indoor cat and there was no place feasible for me to brush him without the hair flying literally all over the room. it almost worked too good on him! anyway, i gave it to a friend who will get a lot of use out of it, i'm sure."
5,THE INCREDIBLE FURMINATOR,"The FURMINATOR is absolutely INCREDIBLE. (My daughter recommended it. She is also a ""cvat-person"".) I live with MANY, MANY cats. The first time I used it, the pile of fur I got out could have been used to create at least half again as many cats. If you live with cats, the FURMINATOR is a MUST-have!!!"
4,FURminator,"We have two dogs with LOTS of hair -- this is one of the most helpful grooming aids my husband has used for our dogs. It is rather amazing to see how much fur comes off, and how little the dogs mind being ""deep-brushed"" this way. The only thing that was not very helpful -- for man's hands at least, is the rather slender handle."
5,magical,the reviews on this product are through the roof! and i totally agree...this thing works wonders and is worth every penny....but try and pay in the $30 range....i think the retail price of $60 is a bit over kill.
3,"Good, but not as good as I had hoped for...","I had no problem with the seller on this product, but I do have a problem with the product. It is a fine comb, and it does an okay job, but for long haired pets I would recomend something else. We had a $5.00 brush from our local super store that I think works better than the firminator. I got this brush because everyone raves about it. But it is really not all that it is cracked up to be. I have an alaskin Malamute (Zoe :) and she has really long hair. Now this is an older version of the brush so maybe the newer modles would work better, but I am not sure. All I can say is that it is not bad for a brush it works okay, but it doesn't work any better than the brush I already had, and for much cheaper! So just beware, that if you have a long haired dog, it may not be your best option."
2,Not the best for a lab,"I had great expectations for this product after reading the reviews and hearing from other dog owners. But,I must say I was not overwhelmed. (Does that mean I was underwhelmed??) Sure it worked, it got the hair off the dog, but much less than I expected. I wouldn't recommend it based on the price. My dog is a lab and perhaps the furminator works better on long haired dogs."
5,LOVE the furminator!,"ABSOLUTELY worth the price - especially on Amazon, they have the best deals. The furminator really works! We've been brushing a few times a week and vacuuming less often!"
3,"Good idea, but -",This tool does not cut cleanly. It is painful to the dog. Don't try it on your hair.
5,great tool for long hair dog grooming,"After hearing about this ""comb"" I wanted one and was not dissappointed. It is better then I heard about. I use it every week to stay ahead of my Golden Retriever's long hair, she is only a puppy still but it's fantastic. Hal"
1,Check the breed list on their website to be sure it's appropriate for your dog!!!!!!!,"If you have a non-shedding breed, such as a Maltese, Poodle, Havanese, etc., please DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT! Go to the Furminator's website and click on the MS WORD document that lists what breeds this tool is to be used upon. Unless used on a shedding breed, it will RIP the hair out from the skin and will be very painful for your dog. It's a great tool if you have a dog listed on their site, but please check to make sure before you purchase and use this."
2,Use if you want a bald pet,This brush literally took all the hair off of my pet... Do not use this on a softer coated pet it will give them bald spots!
1,Not that great-CUTS HAIR,"Have 3 dogs, 2 long hair 1 short. None of them liked it at all, they squirmed and could only take about 5 minutes of it and I was being very careful and gentle. It's not worth the price at all. I will use it as a infreqent grooming tool, to cut out some of the undercoat before I go back to your basic wire grooming brush that get's out the lose hair much better and which at least 2 of my pups enjoy (can't please then all)Cannot recommend it at any price really"
2,Terminator rips fur,"The 1.75 inch Furminator for toy breeds feels like it ""rips"" away at my Pomeranians fur. She is 7 pounds and fights me the whole time I use it. So I don't recommend it for this breed. She loves other tools used for de-shedding, and she will just lay in my lap so it's not the dog."
5,Dog Brush,"My dogs just love this brush and does remove a lot of hair. I would recommend this product to others, you will love it as much as I do."
2,Disappointed,I was disappointed with the Furminator. It seemed to cut the top part of the fur rather than get at the thatch underneath.
3,Furminator Ok,"Pruchesed large 4"" Furminator to use on our English Mastiff. She has a very thick coat and shedds a lot. This does remove a lot of hair, however she does not like it. I do make a point to only use light pressure. Not sure if she does not like the static electricity that it creates or if it is ""pulling"" the hair out. Prior to the Furminator we use a rubber Zoom Groom and a deshedding blade which she would tolerate the process fine. The Furminator removes the same amount of hair in half the time, but , again, she does not seem to like it for whatever reason. I will use it for a while longer to see if she just needs to get used to it."
3,ok,"Tool too sharp for long coat chihuahua's.Tried it on the horses, tines too short, works ok, but not great"
5,Great buy FURminator!,We used this product that our son had on our two large dogs when visiting at Thanksgiving. It's great and decreases rolling fur balls around the house. Was thrilled to find it at Amazon for less than 1/2 the price at Pets Mart and free shipping. Definately 5 stars!
4,Removes a lot of hair,I have a medium and use it on my 40 lb dog and 2 cats. It certainly removes a lot of hair. However it is very sharp and sometimes pulls at my dogs long hair. She doesn't like it much. But it does the job.
5,FURminator,Wonderful! My dog ( a Brittany) loves it. Makes a great gift too. Would surely recommend it!
3,BEWARE!!! NOT a brush,"This is NOT a brush. It is the equivalent of the old-style comb with a razor in it that they used to sell for human heads. It actually is cutting the hair. If you want to thin the hair on your pet, that's great, but it's not ""brushing"" as one would normally expect. It isn't removing loose hair, it's cutting hair that's firmly attached."
5,Loving this Tool,"We have searched for the perfect tool to groom our old english sheep dog and had pretty much given up hope of brushing her ourselves until our Vet's assistant told us about the FURminator. What a wonderful and easy tool to use not to mention it does not hurt our dog! Amazon also had the best price on the FURminator, so do not even try to beat it!!!"
2,Furminator,I was disappointed with the product. The main problem is that even small amounts of fur has to be removed from the teeth constantly in order for it to work.
2,Furminator is #1,This dog grooming tool is the best ever! I have two dogs with lots of fur and the tool works wonders. I highly reccomend it to all furry pet owners.FURminator Large Yellow deShedding Tool with 4-Inch Edge
5,Awesome Tool,I have a Chesappeake/Chocolate lab that sheds like crazy. This brush/comb took off basically the hair of an entire new dog. I know it's more than anyone would usually spend on a pet tool but it is completely worth it.
1,Worthless product in our home,"Considering that some people have actually raved about this product, perhaps there is just a difference in the pet's hair that makes it work for some and not for others.I tried it on both of our cats who have been heavily and continuously shedding. I got next to nothing off their coats with this brush. Then I used a cheap rubber slicker brush from Walmart and got gobs out. It sounds wonderful but sure didn't work for us. I was glad that I got a refund because it was a big waste of money and time."
5,The Best Pet Brush Ever!,"The FURminator is by far the best pet brush I've ever used, and I've used a lot. Aside from the volume of hair, what surprised me most was its ability to collect hair from underneath the top coat. I can't recommend it enough. It is simply the best."
3,Furminator is just OK,"I had high hopes for this product (furminator) but it is by no means a ""miracle"" tool. I would rate it as just OK. My previously purchased (and misplaced) pet brush produced more quantities of fur. For the price charged, it should do a better job."
2,not for non-shedding breeds,"We heard and read such great things about this dog comb, so we decided to pay the extra bucks and order it. Upond arrival we read that it does not work for non-shedding breeds. Our dog is a ""non-shedding breed"" and it is true, it does not work on her. I wish this information had been given before we bought the product."
5,It works great!,I have huskies and do they ever shed. The furminator works great. And the dogs actually seemed to like it better than the other brushes I use to use. People that see them every week have commented on how good their coats look. They also say their clothes aren't as hairy after playing with them. I wish I had gotten one sooner.
5,Great Product but do not buy in stores,"My cousin told me about this product. I used it on my cat and it worked so well. I am very impressed. However, I bought a small one at the pet store for 40 dollars. Buy it online. It is much cheaper."
3,OK..but not for a puppy,"OK..So I gave the Furminator 3 stars because it does what it says that it does, but I think the marketing could have been a little better laid out. I have a 13 week old english cocker spaniel puppy and there is fur everywhere. I bought this to help with the shedding. I do get lots of hair off him but according to the groomer, the hair I have been getting his his puppy hair before it even grows out. I won't be using this product anymore because I want his hair to grow. Even though its winter and I know he is going to be getting a winter coat, I still have a hard time rationalizing removing his puppy fur before it has a chance to come in."
2,"Not as advertised, so what else is new?","This is a hair cutting device, not a comb. If you used this continuously on your pet, you would have a hairless pet. So if that is what you want, be my guest."
1,Not worth the money,I expected great things from this product after reading great reviews. I have a german shepherd. All this product did was make her hair fly all over the place and up my nose! A regular brush catches the hair much better and my dog seems to enjoy it more.
5,The best there is!,This is the most impressive brush I have seen. We have owned others and they were average but this is spectaculor and the dog likes the feel of the brush. We have removed more hair from her this year than ever before and that means less fur shedding in the house. It is one of the first things my granddaughters grab when the come to the house to see who will be first to brush the dog. GREAT BUY!
5,best hair remover around,"I absolutely love this product.And so does my dog.It cut the hair I get on the floors and carpet in half, if not more.Highly, highly recommended."
2,my kitty's opinion,"I thought my cat would love the Furminator. But, try as I might to comb gently through his hair, he pulls away. He much prefers a regular brush."
5,Where do I get a new coat for my pet?,"This is an awesome product for anyone that has a pet. I use it for my rabbit, when she tolerates being brushed. It really does get TONS of fur out. Sometimes it's so effective I wonder if it'll ever end. A great investment for pets that shed a LOT, and for the sake of your clothing and furniture."
4,Fur pile almost the size of the dog,"Our dog's shedding was driving me crazy. There were clumps everywhere. If I washed his bed, he would transfer it from the floor to his bed. If I vacuumed floor, he'd transfer it from the couch to the floor. It was a never ending battle until we got the FURminator. It really takes off a lot of loose undercoat. What comes off on the brush won't end up on the floor. Our dog seems to enjoys being FURminated. When I take it out he goes over to his bed and lays down."
5,"Bought it at the right time, for the right price!",I bought a large FURminator for $7.99... and I'm glad I did! It looks like the price jumped about $20 in the past week. My two cats love it and it has significantly reduced what they'd normally be shedding around the house!
5,Furminator,"We have a large lab that is shedding all over the place. This produce removes tons of her dog hair, and she actually likes being brushed by it. Well worth the money."
3,Gets ahead of shedding,"I was very curious about how this thing works. Now I know: It pulls the hair out. The hairs catch in the tiny teeth and those that are starting to loosen in the follicles are gently pulled out. This is great for people who really want to keep their homes clean and hate dog hair, but for any who are into the ""look"" of a full coated breed it probably removes too much. The directions are honest because they warn you not to stay in the same area too long. Obviously, the pulling will make the skin sore if it is too strong or too long. I suspect that too strong could pull out hairs from follicles not ready to shed. Ouch! The theory is to keep up with the loosening hairs before they come out naturally and are left on the furniture, etc. Dog hairs are lost at a constant rate, so this will require an equally constant rate of removal to be effective. Happy grooming! If that meets the purchaser's needs, go for it. For breeds that blow their undercoats I think a slicker will work better."
3,Expected more for money,"Takes forever to comb thru my Zelda's coat with this. (Think german shep/chow mix) Teeth are great at grabbing undercoat but very short which means lots of parting and pulling, over and over and over... Does seem to grab more undercoat w/each pass over other brush/rakes, but significantly more passes required. Maybe over time I will be able to decrease the frequency with which I comb my dog thus saving time/effort, but I have had this for over two weeks and still havent finished brushing my dog out yet!! Not worth 5x cost of other tools that do similar duty."
5,Brilliant,"I took more hair off my cat in a few minutes than I could in hours with a regular brush. Her fur is very cottony, so it's usually difficult to brush out. No complaints."
5,Great Product!,This product works great! We have 2 one year old cats with medium length hair. The FURminator has gotten out knots from their coats and removed piles and piles of excess fur. The cats look forward to being brushed with it!
4,FURminator,We have a 17yr. old long haired cat that has given up grooming...if it were not for the FURMinator he would be covered with dreads. So effective you need to be gentle and careful or the cat will be bald.
2,FURminator disappointment,"This works fine on my golden retriever puppy and my tabby catHowever, it doesn't do anything for my two golden doodlesThe tines are too short and the head is smaller (width of area from tines to back of head) than I expectedI was hoping to find a tool that would allow me to save money by grooming my dogs at homeIf I had seen this myself at a local pet store, I would have known it wouldn't work and I would not have bought it"
5,Awsome product,"I have 2 continually shedding pugs...This product really helps..I get a lot of hair each time I comb them...and they fight to be groomed, now"
2,Wasn't a miracle for me.,"I really wanted this to work, to find an answer to my couch and bed being too hairy for my or my guests' likings. BUT, the Furminator was not the answer to me. I have a 75 lb. mix- he has short hair, looks like a black lab. This brush simply did not take all that much hair off him. Also, he flinched when I touched the brush to him- lightly! Eventually he would stand for me to brush his back with this-- but he didn't like to let me at his sides, belly, etc. I'm going to try the just a pet-hair vaccum and go for the couch instead of the dog now. I think this product must work best for pets with long hair."
5,The Furminator is FABULOUS!,"The Furminator is a great tool. It works ""slick as a whistle"" and it's sturdy handle and blade make it easy to use and effective as it strips tons of undercoat from my shepherd/chow mix. No more ""house of hair""!!!"
3,Construction is lacking,"The brush itself works great. I have a yellow lab and it takes a lot a hair out but the construction of the tool, I found to be crap! The handle broke after a month an the don't offer any replacement parts so you have to order a new one."
4,aliceupnorth,"So far, it really removes the hair. My Golden, Bailey, does not seem to like itmuch so I have to be more careful when I'm brushing her."
4,furminator not just for dogs! great on shedding out horses!,Love the furminator to shed out horses. Only drawback is getting dirt out from the blade. Have to do it immediately and work at it each time.
5,A MUST HAVE for all pet owners...,"This is absolutely one of the best products on the market! I recommend that all pet owners get one. It is perfect for getting that undercoat that seems to fly all over the house and matt up your dogs fur! My dog has shortish hair and it works wonders. His coat has never looked so shiny and beautiful. Normally when I brush him he shakes and shivers all over, but he doesn't seem to mind this brush at all. In fact, I think he looks forward to me doing it. I definitely recommend this product. It is sturdy and easy to use and you WON'T be disappointed!"
4,Furminator's good,"Doesn't work well unless the dog has been shampooed the day before. Still can't seem to make it work like the videos I found online, but it does help a lot."
5,Just what I looking for!,"I called lots of groomers, and found that they were no longer willing to groom cats. They said it's too difficult, and too many problems come up. My cat has long hair, and is very sensitive, but she lets me use this grooming tool on her! It's really helping to keep the knots / mats down, and she doesn't shed as much as she did."
5,I love the Furminator!!!!,"My boyfriend has a large hairy Siberian Husky. Since moving in together, I've been going crazy over how much hair the dog sheds. I love the dog but her hair drove me crazy. Hair flies off her body when she's walking... Then a friend recommended the Furminator. My boyfriend was skeptical that it actually works better than the old brush his had forever. So we did a comparison brush with the his brush and my new Furminator. That's the last time he brought up the topic. As I pulled the lump of hair off of the Furminator, he tossed his brush in the trash..."
4,Dog Brush,My dog is a 4 lb. Chihuahua and even though this is the small brush I have to be very careful with it because of her size. My daughter has the medium sized furminator for her mid-sized dog and two cats and it works great for them.
4,Great so far!,"I just received this and have only been using it for two days, but so far this is amazing! My lab actually likes to be brushed with this, and the Furminator removes A LOT of loose fur! I am hopeful that this will help the problem of constantly sweeping up fur in our house. Am recommending this to all my friends! My lab is 95 lbs and the small size works fine (it just may be faster with a larger one?). I bought the small in hopes my cat will let me use it on him, too."
1,Where is my FURminator?,"Well... I know that the FURminator is a great product, I would highly recommend it to anyone with a dog or cat. Big Problem though - I still have not received my order and according to the distributor it shipped on 12/3/11. I am very disappointed and have no idea where my order is or when the distributor will correct this issue. I should have just paid full price and purchased it in store which it looks like I will probably do so at this point."
5,FURminator deShedding Tool,"This is a great product, it really works as described. My cat loves to be combed and it helps keep the shedding to a minimum."
5,"Fabulous, and the animals actually enjoy it!","Our family includes six dogs ranging from a Chihuahua to a Doberman (two of them, a collie and a labrador retriever, have long coats) plus one (very wary) cat. I purchased this product after reading an enthusiastic review of it in a glossy dog-enthusiast magazine; the price at amazon.com was far less than half the price for the same item in the leading mail order pet products catalog. Not only does Furminator work as represented, extracting huge fluffy clouds of fur, especially from the dogs with long coats; the animals, even the cat, also seem to enjoy the grooming and happily remain passive and relaxed until I've been thoroughly over them. This one's a winner!"
5,A must have!,"This is an awesome tools for dog, and cat, owners! I bought this for 2 Norwegian Elkhounds who have a TON of fur!! It is easy to use, easy to hold, and the dogs love not having all that extra fur coat during the hot summer months. I recommend to use this outside because the amount of fur that is removed is remarkable!!"
5,Works really well on my Old English Sheepdog!!,I just received this product yesterday evening and it works really well on my Old English Sheepdog. I would highly recommend.
5,outstanding tool,This tool tops all others we have tried. It cuts the under fur without pulling or cutting the animal.
4,Great comb,Great dog comb for getting out the undercoat of my Pomeranian. if you don't comb one spot too long the dog wont mind as much. Just remember to make long strokes and move around.
4,Best dog brush I've used so far,My dog sheds like crazy and I couldn't find a brush that would actually minimize the shedding until I had somebody tell me about the furminator. So I got on amazon and searched it and bought it. This this does amazing things to my dogs coat and keeps the loose hair problem down to almost nothing. I love this thing. Although one extra thing it could have is a little button that will push the hair out of the brush and into the garbage. But other than that... You would be making a mistake by not buying this product.
2,Grooming,I have a Golden Retriever and my stripping brush does just as good a job of removing her undercoat as this product. I think the hype has influenced its reputation more than its performance! Its OK but NOT marvelous.
4,Furminator,"From our 21-year-old, who owns the dog for which the Furminator was bought: ""I would say very good, but not great. She still sheds a little even after I've furminated her, but her coat is much softer and smoother."""
4,"So far, so good...","So far, we are quite pleased with the product. Our dog (a wolf hybrid), enjoys the feel of the Furminator...at the very least, he doesn't fight us! We have come up with piles of fur, and it seems to have reduced the amount of fur spread randomly around the apartment! The big test will be in the spring, when the wolf sheds his winter undercoat (it comes out in chunks).Also, can't beat the price we got here! In stores, the same Furminator was going for $40+. Definitely worth ordering online.Thanks!"
5,Wow!,"This shedding tool works and works and works. I cannot seem to get down to the end of the shedding. You could fill a pillow with dog hair (if you wanted to). It is way better than any brush I have used. Other retail outlets sell the same thing for 3 x the price ( I know because I bought one for that much) and it is the same thing. Do your dog a favor, not to mention the person who vacuums your house!"
5,Necessary,"Everyone with an animal needs this product whether you have a cat or a dog. It is a quick, clean way to help a shedding pet!"
3,Well.......,"Ok, this thing seems to work but I've come to the conclusion it really doesn't. What it does, I think, is CUT the hair--leaving plenty of hair ready to shed (i.e. pulled out by a regular brush or comb). I have a Border Collie mix, with medium to long hair. She sheds horribly and hates to be brushed or combed. The Furminator is no exception but I think it is painless in every way (meaningly no better or worse than regular brushing). However, as I stated above, it cuts the hair but doesn't necessarily remove shedding hair. A lot of hype, some help, but not a replacement for regular grooming or brushing."
4,Not sure if it is worth the price but it does the job just fine,"This tool is crazy expensive but it does get the hair off pets nicely. I have a coworker with two cats and allergies and it seems to work for her, her kitties love it. My dog, on the other hand, doesn't like it nearly as much. But to be fair, he generally doesn't like being brushed for more than a few seconds anyway."
2,My cats don't like it.,I think it's great but my cats try to run when they see it instead of their normal brush making it hard to use.
4,It does what it says,"This ""brush"" pulls out a lot more hair a lot faster than a regular comb or brush. We have a Great Pyrenees and when she is shedding, there is a LOT of hair. She does not like the feel of this tool as much as the regular ones. You can not use it on her legs as it seems to hurt her. I do believe it shortens the time it takes to brush her, but I am not sure if the overall results are any better."
5,Well Worth the Price,"My vet recommended this for my black lab-rottweiler dog who sheds an incredible amount... we furminated her for the first time and got a HUGE bag of fur... now we furminate her briefly once a day, just a few quick passes, and it has DRAMATICALLY cut down on the amount of time we have to sweep and wash her bedding! It's super easy to use, the dog doesn't seem to mind at all, and it's the easiest brush to clean that you'll ever use! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT!"
4,Cheapest place to buy the Furminator,I had heard great things said about the Furminator from friends so when shopping for it....I looked at alot of places and seen the price always around $50. I was able to purchase it thru Amazon for $30 which included shipping. It has worked just as my friends had told me except I was able to buy it for much less than they did.
5,Works great on German Shepherds,"Remarkably, German Shepherds that are abandoned are rejected for largely for two reasons - they shed heavily year-round and they follow their owners around everywhere. This product eliminates one of those reasons. Our German Shepherd loves being combed with the FURminator, and it does a great job of getting all of the loose fur off the dog in a short period of time, though ""Babe"" tends to enjoy the attention involved in grooming anyway. I highly recommend this product."
4,works,It works well in removing hair but it will continue to remove hair if you did it every day! We have a Golden Retriever and you can get a waste basket full of hair every day if you wish. So it does not end the shedding problem.
3,Good but not worth more than $10.,"The brush works great at removing hair. Works well for long hair and short hair alike. HOWEVER, this item is NOT worth more than $10. Several Chinese manufacturers sell the same brush for ~$10."
3,Furminator for use on large pony,"Better and easier to use than a regular shedding blade. Worth the sale price, but I would never pay the full price for it! I don't have a dog or cat to try it on, but it worked reasonably well for the pony."
2,Disappointed,"This tool works well on my short haired hound, but is quite useless on the long hair of the border collie and mutt."
5,Why did I wait so long to purchase the BEST brush ever???,"I have heard many good things about the FURminator but kept waiting to buy it. It's by far the best brush I've EVER purchased for my Labradoodle, whom has more lab in her than poodle: hence...shedding. It seems like I could brush her for hours and still get fur out of her.What's different from the FURminator compared to a 'regular' dog brush? It actually brushes out fur where all other brushes seem to 'style' the fur. It brushes out fur I never KNEW she had! And the best part is, it brushes out easily so it ends up in the trash rather than on our floors and furniture.The other great thing about the FURminator is that she LOVES being brushed by it where she couldn't wait to get away from other brushes.Highly recommended, highly affordable, and it WORKS WONDERFULLY!"
5,Amazing Deshedder- Buy the Furminator now..,"We have two labs and our old tool broke so I ordered the Furminator. This tool arrived and within 5 minutes we were using it on our labs. My wife who usually does the grooming could not stop exclaiming how amazing this tool worked. I collected bags of hair. If you have shedding dogs, get this tool now.... AMAZING Product"
4,furminator,"Great product, very effective hair removal, helps keep my house clean andmy dog's coat smooth. Everyone with a dog should have one."
2,Furminator with a Chow Chow,"I bought this bc I have a Chow Chow with very thick fur. I normally use a rake tool but thought I would give this a try. I got the medium, and when i tried it, the fur came out but it came out in small pieces and didnt stick to the tool like it did on the rake. The fur just blew all around the house like tumbleweeds, as opposed to sticking on the rake until it filled up. The same process was being achieved, but I felt like it would take 5x as long with the Furminator. Chows shed that undercoat in little chunks, not like a Lab would shed. This part I didnt like bc my dog has so much hair and I have to rake her undercoat so deep, the furminator didnt get as deep as my rake did, the teeth were not as long. I beleive this tool would work great on a shorter haired dog that didnt have as dense and thick of an undercoat as a Chow does, but I did end up returning it. The rake I feel is the best for my favorite breed of dog. I hope this helps."
4,El mejor producto para el pelo de mi labrador,"Luego de 2 años de probar con diferentes cepillos para el pelo de mi labrador, este sin duda es el mejor. Es importante seguir las instrucciones. La única desventaja es que debido a que se trata de acero inoxidable hay que usarlo con cuidado para evitar lastimar al perro. Por lo demás es excelente!!!"
3,The FUR U NOT,"I have to say after purchasing this, I was very dissapointed. My dog is a very shedding dog. I could of done better with shears. Sorry furmantor, should of named it FUR U NOT"
5,multiple pet family fuminator,"I have 2 shedding German Shepherds and 5 dust bunnies disquised as cats. This tool does a great job on them. The dogs have even started liking to be groomed, because this tool does not pull their hair, but believe me, it takes the undercoat out!! I would recommend this tool highly. I love it."
4,Once you get the hang of it...,"Once you get the hang of it, the Furminator is a great tool to reduce shedding, and my dog seems to really like being deshedded. He just lays there like he's getting a massage, even when I feel like I might be tugging at his hair a little too hard. The only reason I didn't give the Furminator 5 stars is because while it's pulling the undercoat and loose hairs, it also cuts little pieces of some of his hair. It's not a huge deal, and I'll definitely continue to use it. I just wish it wouldn't cut the tips of some of his hairs."
4,Works Great,"We have several dogs, and this thing does a great job. The dogsenjoy having it used on them, and it really gets rid of excess hair.It's a little pricey for what it is I think, but it gets results."
4,Furminator works well on Akitas,"I have two Akitas which means I have alot of fur to brush. I typically use a slicker wire brush. I can get alot of fur off with this but it takes time. I believe the furminator gets as much fur but in half the time. My female has been shedding for the last month (I think we are at the end now) and I have been using the furminator 1 - 2 times a week. It takes me about 15 minutes to brush her has opposed to the usual 30 or more. It works well and is easier to use the the wire brush. Neither one of my dogs like their legs/paws brushed, but the tolerate the furminator very well. I would like to say it has reduced the amount of fur in my house, but when my female sheds it is pretty constant so it is hard to tell if I have less than I would normally have when she sheds. I am hoping that the blades last for awhile, especially having two dogs. I would not call this a miracle brush, but a good tool that works well and gets the job done."
2,Furminator,I really am not impressed with this product. It does not work anything like the viedo showes. I have a lab and a chow mix and I hardley get hair off of either one with out a lot of pressure and both of my dogs really do not enjoy it. One actually wines when I brush him. It is not worth the money at all. The shipping and service from the company was great but the product sucks.
1,Disappointing,Id heard so much about furminator so was excited to get this. It really didn't brush any better or even as well as the brush we already own.
4,Love all the stories in the book,Ever since I use bible stories to my kids during bedtime. I love all the stories here because it has a moral and my kids follow them. They also love the colors and how it was illustrated in the story.The Earth Dog Story
1,Disappointed!!,"While reducing the Bible to a readable story might be a good idea for the very young, I will never buy another book by Zonderkidz or Zondervan. I was shocked to find that Zondervan has defiled the word of God trying to be politically correct. In their words ""God made the most wonderful creature of all - a person"". Not a MAN?!?! But three pages later he made a woman, why not a woperson? Just plain stupid and disappointing!! I am afraid of what other trash they put into this book."
3,The content is a little boring.,I think it is hard to brief the Bible stories into a simple children's book. The general book quality is good in both the illustrations and words. And it is relatively cheap compared with some other similar books. But I have to say the stories were told in a very blank and plain way that my child didn't find it very interesting. I wonder if there are some better books out there.
5,The Beginner's Bible:Timeless Children's Stories,"We bought this book for our granddaughter,Sailor. Her mother works so is not able to take Sailor to church. She wanted to have a good book to read the bible stories to 5 year old Sailor. It was perfect, lots of pictures and the stories are written in an easy to understand way."
4,good book,Good book for really young kiddos. I would not recommend it to anyone 6 years or older. Stories are watered down.
4,My daughter likes it,My daughter attends a Christian school and they use the same Bible in school. She liked that she could read the same stories at home too.
1,DEFACING HOLLY'S BEST WORK,"Fair enough, this album is a compilation of some of Buddy Holly's finest work, mostly recorded in 1957-58 on the Brunswick and Coral labels.BUT -- on this album a vocal group called the Picks overdub their vocal harmonies over these tracks.I believe this was done around 1990.These Picks overdubs have been repackaged many times under many different album titles on different bogus ""labels"". This is merely their most recent resurfacing.In my opinion it is a tragic defacing of Holly's great classics.I strongly urge anyone even thinking about buying this to at least hear the REAL Holly first. And even then, make sure to sample what you get here before paying honest money for it.Buddy Holly was an extraordinary talent. Treat yourself to the real thing."
2,great cookbook but not on Kindle,"I love this cook book; I've just ordered a hard copy because I returned the Kindle Edition. I can use the Table of Contents to get to a section, for example: ""Soups"" or ""Main Dishes"" but I can't select a recipe. If I want the last dish in a section, I have to page forward until I get there. Too cumbersome. I won't be buying anymore cook books or reference books on Kindle. (Also, the pictures don't work out.) I love, love, love my Kindle, but not for this. I won't be buying anymore cook books or reference books on Kindle."
3,Good Book,"I liked this book okay! I bought it after I read the book ""Breaking the Pattern"" by Charles Platkin...that book was acutally what inspired me to eat healthily. This book is great once you make the decision though."
3,Not too impressed,"I was not very impressed by this cookbook. Although the recipes sound delicious, they are complicated with lots of ingredients. As a busy mother, I don't think I would take the time to make most of these dishes except maybe on special occasions."
4,Profound Marital Theology,"This is a great and perhaps life-changing book for many marriages. Unfortunately, the language is intensely theological. Those familiar with basic theological terms within the Orthodox Christian tradition have an incredible tool in their hands. This is one of the few English works on the theology of the masculine and feminine - the roots of their being and differences, their special charisms, the impact of the fall on cross-gender relations and the recapitulation of those relations in Christ through the mystery of marriage. If you can follow the language in this review, you can follow the language in the book. I wouldn't be without this read. It has a way of reworking modern thought from two people constantly butting heads in a marriage to the realization of an important interplay between masculine and feminine differences and how they can serve to achieve not only a better whole, but salvation for those two as well."
2,No Replacement Rockets,"The rocket launched very nicely a few times, but then the top rubber part of the rocket blew out and isn't fixable. I went to the Estes web site to try to order a few replacement rockets, and the part isn't listed. I've tried to contact them twice, and have gotten no reply. At this point, the thing is useless."
2,Product needs work,I also had a hard time getting the rocket to fly. It seemed to help to extend the cord for the rocket fully. Like it had some kind of built in safety mechanism.
5,51 Jewel Swiss Automatic Zodiac,"I have seen other brands of watches using this same automatic movement selling for $5,000.00 U.S. retail! I didn't pay nearly that much. The Zodiac is just the right size, and has the appeal to those of us who like Sports watches. The clear display back lets the owner view the working movement in action. The leather strap has a high tech clasp, as well as ""dimples"" located on the inside of the strap to secure the watch on the wrist so it doesn't move to one side or the other. Overall, one of my very best watch purchases of the 50 or so that I have owned. This one is a real ""Keeper"", and I will be owning it until death do us part!"
3,"it's not great, but not too bad","Some of my favorite artists are on this cd and that is why I bought it. Everything I expected came from them- such as Somewhere, Someday by NSYNC and We're a Miracle by Christian Aguilera. Both songs are incredible. But there were a few surprises on this cd also. I really like M2M's Don't Say You Love Me. I also like It Was You by Ashley Ballard and Lullaby by Mandah. Both unknowns but very talented. Everything else I could do without."
3,"Not Bad, Not Great","The album is a cross between cornball bubblegum pop tunes and rather lovely ballads. The best track by far is Christina Aguilera's ""We're A Miracle,"" which surprised me. The song showcases Aguilera's exceptional vocal capabilities and soulful intrepretation, right up there with Mariah Carey and Whitney Houston. If there was any reason to purchase this album, it would definitely be for the Aguilera track."
5,Good Varius Artist CD!,"I think pokemon is the dumbest thing, personally! well Im a 14 yr old girl, I only got it cuzza ""Have some fun with the funk"" by Aaron Carter wich is not released on any of his cds. It has a good variety of songs like ""Dont say you love me"" M2M and the unreleased n sync track ""Somewhere Someday"" and those other songs that have absolutely nuthin to do with pokemon (Thank god) but there are 2 songs about pokemon for the little fans, so, if ya like this kinda pop music, yup, and if ur a nsync fan that has ta have everything get it."
5,one of the best!!!!!!!,"i have one word,WOW!!!!I bought this at almost a year ago and i still love it! It has some of the best music for pokemon i've ever seen."
2,Don't Say You Love Me,"My younger sister got this Cd because she loves Pokemon. I listened to it and truly almost all the songs are sung by whiny teenagers(ex: Aaron Carter, Ashley Ballard), and people that think they are still teenagers (ex: NSync, Vitamin C, Emma Bunton). But I love M2M's song ""Don't Say You Love Me"" They really have a lot of talent,(even though I don't think they wrote the song) especially for their age, and they are not annoying like most teen pop artists(ex: Britney Spears, Christina Aguielera, Aaron Carter). I am going to order their M2M's single now. I hope they continue singing."
1,Pokemon more like Pokepuke,"this is a horrible cd,it's a disgrace to the words Compact Dic NO MORE POKEMON NO MORE POKEMON2600"
5,Lovely movie,this is again a great addition to any pokemon fan collection. Mt son really enjoyed the movie and watches it over and over again.
3,I REMEMBER THIS...,"Back when I was 8, when this movie came out, ANYTHING POKEMON (except the cards) HAD TO BE MINE! I had no idea what pop music even was back then put Pokemon=best in the world back then. I gave this CD away (along with my 2BA Master CD) 2 or 3 years ago, (found it hard to let go of Pokemon, my taste for it lingered into 2001/02). and from time to time I still listen to the samples from time to time. I think they should have improved this CD by putting ""Is There Something I Should Know?"" by Duran Duran or ""Do You Really Want To Hurt Me?"" by Culture Club. My advice: If you're over the age of 10, don't buy this. 6-10: buy buy buy now!"
5,Exelente descubrimiento de musica para piano,"Me gusta mucho el piano, y buscando autores poco conocidos (al menos por mi), encontre este disco,y me gusto lo que escuche."
5,LOVE this show,I cannot say enough good about the Wild Kratts. We love the show. I frequently watch with the boys and they learn so much about some pretty random animals. But they have a very fact based show mixed with enough imagination to keep the boys interested in watching them over and over again. My son has often come to me telling me about one that I may have missed while doing other house hold chores. I am glad to have something more educational and less crass than say spongebob to put on for my boys.
5,Nice Change of Pace,"This is a great album for a true Alanis fan, but probably not for less serious fans. I was disappointed in You Learn, because it sounds like she forget some of the words in it. The best song on the album is Uninvited. It gives me chills to listen to it. Not a smashing success, but definitely worth the money."
1,not so hot,"I just couldnt get into this one. her voice is tired, her lyrics sound less intelligent when she loses the polishing of production and she doesnt have the verve to carry on song after song without the flash and dazzle she gets at live concerts. i guess alanis is more of a corporate creation than i wanted to admit."
4,"normally, i don't go for live discs, but...","I just downloaded this off Itunes (hey, it's cheaper and no shipping). The tracks I've listened to are just phenomenal -- the quality of the acoustics is really high and audience noise is at a minimum (which is why some live discs just bother me -- if I can't even hear the song because of 1000s of screaming fans, why bother?). The cover of 'king of pain' is worth the price of admission alone. And 'uninvited' sounds better than ever - it remains, for me, her best song. Needless to say, Alanis's voice is as emotion-drenched as ever and she acquits herself well in a live setting.No THANK YOU PERU (err, hon, it's Brazil) debacles.If you like her, you won't be disappointed. If she's not your favorite, this might suprise you. Try it."
5,Way off the top list chart,"All I can say it that, this CD is way off the top hits list. This is the best album of Alanis."
4,The Ultimate Alanis Collection.. but a Little Raw,"UNPLUGGED has the potential to be absolutely stunning, but, as it was recorded live, it's a little rawer than her studio recordings.Unplugged is a collection of all of Alanis' greatest hits (as of the late nineties), one cover, and a few tracks only performed live. For some of the songs, the sheer potency of a live album adds to their apeal. Highlights would include Joining You, Ironic, Head Over Feet, That I Would Be Good, You Learn and No Pressure Over Cappuccino. But the angstier songs like You Oughtta Know, These R The Thoughts and I Was Hoping sound wrong. Her heart simply isn't in them as well live as on the studio recordings.This is an essential for the Alanis fan, but a bad place to start for the Alanis novice."
3,Interesting story,"Muckraker has an interesting story, which is good. Callahan really captured the high school bullying experience.However, the editor didn't do a diligent job, and it's riddled with grammatical errors and typos, which is bad. There are many detailed descriptions of people, places and things -- ones which could have been more streamlined and made punchier, again, something the editor didn't seem to focus on. I enjoyed it, but I've also had to skim some of the descriptions to get through it."
3,Rob Roy is a great builder (of cordwood masonry),"It's important to know before you buy this book, or his book about Underground Homes, that they use the cordwood masonry building technique, more or less to exclusion. Roy has saved this technique from oblivion but he tries to pass off his books as ""complete"" in the sense of including various techniques. They don't. I'm not saying not to get them, but remember that caveat."
5,Great selection of Vocab for a short period of time!,"This book contains crucial SAT vocab words, not too many words like some other books do, so you can really learn them in a short period of time. Also, for each words, it gives easy and clear definitions with part of speech and really good example sentences. Memorize all the words in this book, then you'll have a good background vocab for SAT verbal."
5,excellent quality,"Excellent gardening glove for women, which is hard to find. Strong, comfortable, flexible."
1,Wait until bugs are ironed out!!!,"This latest expansion to EQ is nothing but trouble. Go check out the Everquest message boards (...)The game has been down for two days now awaiting fixes for this newest expansion. Not to mention in order to SEE any of this expansion Sony suggests you have 512MB RAM and a 64MB Video card, but only a select few video cards will work!Customer service is non-existant, spend your money on something else."
5,Newest technology available,"Like it did nearly 2 and half years ago, Sony and Verant will blow away the competition with this new expansion. It has been dubbed Everquest 1.5 by many of the staff because it is a huge stepping stone between the original EQ and EQ2. It uses the newest graphics engines in a marriage with the most advanced gaming systems ever developed. This is definitely going on the wishlists of hundreds of thousands of people worldwide, and I wouldn't be surprised if it ends up being the number one selling computer game of the 4th quarter if not the year!Buy this game if your system can handle it, if it can't maybe you should put two things down on your holiday wishlist.-Loyal Everquest Customer for 2 years"
2,They lost the recipe.,"Don't expect this to be an expansion to EQ as you know it. It is nothing like EQ, Kunark, and the Velious expansion. They changed the recipe - and is isnt for the better.They lost something in this expansion. Some zones in it are very nice, and others are just plain 'intolerable' for a 'pay-for-play'game. The bazaar is a nice feature, as well as being more independant on porting yourself around the game universe, but the gameplay - has me shaking my head sometimes.Advice...quit neglecting that poor dog and take him for a walk."
5,$10 a month and worth every penny,"$10 a month is cheap for the entertainment value you receive from everquest. First of all, the game is incredibly more engaging than any of the ""funnier"" games as the other guy mentioned.... and it requires a lot more involvement of producer staff...thus the $10. But when you look at it, it's only $2.50 a week. Compare it with a trip to the movies....So if you're only interested in big guns and blowing people up, yeah, don't pay $10. But if you want something really interactive, with a community of players that you can actually interact with, then get this. Much better than the other online RPGs, btw.."
2,The same old thing over again,"This is obviously what Verant had in mind when Everquest became a big success. Release expansion after expansion to keep current players interested (while still bringing in money by selling the expansion), and to reap in new players with the slogan ""Hey! We have three expansions! Buy Everquest, plus all three expansions!"". They are selling the expansion at almost full price of retail software ([$]? Come on now...), PLUS it almost guarantees that existing players will keep their accounts. The game will still become a big bore when the gameplay runs dry. Shame on you, Verant. I hope this isn't what happens to all future MMORPG's."
3,EverQuest,"Although I obviously do not have this expansion set yet, I have been playing EQ since november of 1999. It is a very addictive but exspensive game. This game owns your life. When I stopped playing I had so much more fun with my life. I went out with my friends just about everyday when I quit this game. I saved a lot of money to. The game itself really isnt that fun when you break it down. What do you do? Sit in one spot waiting for a certain monster to pop up, sometimes for hours and even then it doesnt show up. Then if you are lucky and you spot the critter, you need to be even luckier in order to get some rare item off it. After all this waiting what do you do? You either sell it or keep it, and repeat this painstakig process."
1,TOO LAGGy,"OK I love the graphics in this expansion and stuff like that but just to tell you the truth this expansion LAGS on a 2.2Ghz 1Gb RAM Geforce 4 Ti 4600 with 128 megs, and this is no joke. I would recommend to get thsi expansion only for the bazaar feature because it is very convinient."
2,Weak,"I read Monsta Kody's autobiography first and it was good, then I read this cause Monsta is on the cover. It's hella weak. The author is a white lady, now there is nothing wrong with this until you start reading and you see the ""N"" word used incorrectly over and over. Anybody that has any sense know that street cats use that word 100 times a day but it is pronounced Nigah. She doesnt get it tho, it is spelled out the way a racist would say it with the ""ER"" on the end of the word. I aint saying that she is racist but to me it's a sign that she wrote a book about something that she didn't understand...so how can the book be all that good. She isn't naming sets, she is calling Ese's ""Essays"", the stories are not that interesting...maybe if I woulda read this before I read Monsta's book it woulda been readable. If you are interested in this subject and you have have limited funds buy Monsta Kody's book instead."
2,glorification of gangstas,Members of the Crips and the Bloods speak out in this book. Most of it is inane--the babbling of uneducated kids who don't know how tragic and foolish their lives are. It's gets tiresome after a few pages. I did not enjoy this book.
3,Interesting,"Pretty good book. I enjoyed reading. Author could have done a better job translating text. Ex. ""What's up my Nigga"" vs What's up my Nigger"""
2,"Has value, but lacks broader understanding","Although it is definitely refreshing that the author allows the gang members to speak for themselves in this book, she has not really done her job as journalist and author. I would like to have seen her spend more time examining the SOCIAL FORCES that created the gangs, putting them into some kid of overall context. Why Southern California? Why South-Central? Why now at this time in the country's history? many important questions are not even raised, much less explored."
4,DVD,"Received quickly - the DVD did freeze a couple of times...had to keep trying to get it restarted, even after cleaning it, but it eventually worked through it. Aggravating, but no big deal."
5,a weathervane of changing music,"I bought this album some years ago, not realizing it was done in 1996.Talitha apparently had her ear to the ground, because some of the beats she was using are everywhere now. Blending Scots Gaelic sources with WorldBeat and electronic music, she's created an interesting fusion album that catches the listener's ear and never lets you forget that this is traditional music, only modernized. In ten years, this album has held up very well, sounding as hip and cool as your new cell phone tone. Oh, there are a few tunes that sound as if you're back in the 18th century, such ""Griogare"", mournful and beautiful, but generally it's as modern as a microchip."
4,organizer,"Very nice organizer, sturdy, easy to use. However, picture makes it look higher than it actually is. Larger bottles cannot easily fit into it."
4,functional...but a little shallow,Very functional. I only wish it was a bit deeper so all the pencils can stand in it more comfortably. Worth the money.
1,Make sure to look at size dimensions,"I was so disappointed in this Vanity Organizer, I think the picture is very deceiving, the picture almost makes you think it is quite a large unit,showing it large in the picture, it is not, if you are looking to store even a few items in this you will be greatly disappointed, make sure to look at the dimensions, I would also suggest to this seller to show a true picture with something sitting next to it like most other pictures of products you buy, I hate being fooled when I purchase something especially for that price, to much of a pain to send it back because I purchased several items along with it."
2,Temporary use only,We bought two of these mats last Christmas. We used one for playing on (we have tile floors) and one as a safety net under my son's crib. Less than a year later the top layer is peeling off and the handles have torn off. This is not a sturdy mat. I am very disappointed in the quality. I am in search of a better quality mat as we are now using the mats for physical therapy. It is unpleasant to have pieces of the mat stuck to your child as she rolls or moves across the mat.
2,Top layer peeled off,Loved the mat. Have had mat for just under a year. Used on hardwood floor as soft surface for baby to play until it started peeling. The cute star pattern is coming up in big chunks. Baby likes to pull them off. Have to retire mat.
1,"Made for tumbling, only if you are really gentle.","I purchased this as a Christmas gift for the kids. Within an hour of this being played with, the cheap plastic material this is made with had a hole in it and one of the handles was beginning to tear off. This is probably best for a baby to roll around or sit and play on. Amazon promptly had UPS pick this up and we were refunded very quickly. I was surprised at how little this weighed, now I know why. I love Amazon, just not cheaply made tumbling mats."
5,If you are sensative this book is for you.,For many years I could not figure out why it was so hard to be in crowds. Why I wanted to get away - to escape. Why it felt so uncomfortable. I now know. I was picking up and absorbing the feelings of others and it was affecting the way I physically felt. I would recommend this book to anyone who is looking for answers regarding their sensitivity issues. I not only recommend this book but I have attended Dr. Mesich's classes and would also recommend them.
1,A Huge Disappointment!!!`,"There was virtually nothing helpful in this book. I expected substance, not ""flower essences"". If you are looking for helpful information in dealing with the sensitive trait, this is not the book for you."
1,"If you like spilled fuel, buy this!",I've tried using this this more than once to refill my mower and have had to wash the spilled fuel off the mower and my hands. It may be OK to fill up an automobile or other equipment with large fuel tanks but it's not worth a flip for filling small yard equipment.
5,"No comparison to the Bob Books, says our 3 girls","We have 3 girls all under the age of 5, and we're huge fans of Dora. So, the familiar characters, themes, colors and storylines keep our girls' attention and interest much better than the highly recommended Bob Books. Our 2-year old screams out the correct answers, our 4-year old works on her sounds & phonics, and our 5-year old is determined to read all the short sentences herself...and we just bought the series 4 days ago."
2,Good Books - Not Great for the Beginnning Reader,"My daughter is a kindergartener, coming out of two years at a Montessori Pre-school. Last year she was working on an advanced kindergarten curriculum, so she has been reading for about a year now. I purchased this set for her since she has completed the Modern Press First Phonics Series. She was very excited about the Dora books, but they were definitely not an easy read for her. She needed help with sounding out three letter combination sounds (str) and compound words. I recommend the books only if you are looking to challenge a beginning reader."
3,Prefer Clifford Starter kit,"My daughter (who is going to be 3 soon) is a big Dora fan. I got this book set based on her liking of the character. Although its nice, its not an easy read nor is there a repeatability in the pattern. She had been gifted for her 2nd B'day with a Clifford book set, which she really knew to read on her own. (Of course she memorized the flow of sentences). Even though she has been owning the Dora for 6 months or so till now, she has not been able to read this all by herself. So I find that the Clifford book works more for her!!!"
3,clearly a B movie but not bad,"This is an ok movie with an interesting twist. For Adrian Paul fans, it is worth the purchase."
1,Whose face is shaped for this??????,"Ugh! This is the worst shaped face cradle I have ever seen! There was absolutely NO contour for the forehead, cheeks or mouth. If your patients are dolphins, toucans or someone with a pointy face, no forehead or cheeks, then this is the cradle for you.This is the most ridiculous design I have ever seen. Bought it, received it and returned it."
1,Works better as a doorstop,Bought this item at the local Lowes. Good thing I kept the little box. Like another reviewer said its inconsistent. Never reads the same edge twice in a row from same direction. And on a smooth sheetrocked ceiling with nothing else in between not even paint it doesnt find a darn thing. If you can't return it then at least use it for what its meant for. DOORSTOP!!
1,it's not even worth a one-star rating,I cannot believe Stanley has the nerve to sell a piece of junk like this. The measurement is completely inaccurate.
1,Can I go zero stars?,"Worthless as teats on a boar hog. As best I can tell, they've designed it to light up at random - either that, or my walls are alive, and move their studs around at will.I'd have been better off using dollar bills to light a fire."
1,Garbage,"AC sensor beeps constanly, never get the same reading twice. Instructions are horrible. This one is going back to the store!"
3,Good,"The pictures were good but not a lot of close ups. Pretty basic information, same as textbook information."
1,Do not read this guy's books,"Be aware this guy is a major exponent of disinfo..... and, is part of a network pretending to do Wilhelm Reich justice but is actually working to marginalise and diminish his discoveries.... you want to learn about Orgone, read Reich's books....then Trevor constable's."
1,Just Plain Irritating !,"There may be some good info somewhere in this video, but it is just very irritating to watch. The constant double exposure and fading in and out between images makes it hard to concentrate on what the narrator is trying to convey. It is sort of like a project for film techniques class. The soundtrack is great if you like punk, but does not exactly add to the experience. If you want an art movie, buy it. If you are looking for the secrets of the universe, buy a book."
3,Its Okay....,This DVD has some great information and shows some really weird old depictions of serpents and how they were a common fabric of life. I was a little disappointed in the presentation overall but I it is still worth the view.
3,Great story but...,"The book was received in excellent condition, but unfortunately looked like a school text book rather than something for my personal library. The words are a classic but the appearance detracts from the joy of ownership."
1,Nothing like the book...,"I have to start by saying the Kidnapped is one of my favorite books. I've read it many, many times so I know that no movie version can do it full justice. Actually, the best version I'd ever seen was the Disney version with Peter Finch, so I was very interested to see if this one would be more faithful to the book. I was extremely disappointed: while David's character is ok (albeit a bit boring), Alan is completely and utterly changed beyond all recognition. Not only does he look and act like someone out of a Dumas novel, but near the end he is actually portrayed as a *coward*! If there is anything in the world that Alan Breck Stewart is NOT, that would be a coward! Arg, I was yelling at the TV, it was that bad. So if you're a fan of the book, do yourself and everyone around you a favor and give this one a miss."
4,intensive tables,"almost complete tables, as much as this is possible due to the shear amount of integrals. requires some getting used to in order to use the tables on the fly. nice to know that there is a web page which lists corrections to wrongly printed integrals, however I would prefer correct tables from the get go!"
1,Piece of junk,The glass cooktop broke 2 times in a year due to the poorly designed vent and the company refused to cover it under warranty. The keypad failed after 18 months. The quality and service do not match the price tag!
3,Not too warm for Michigan weather,"I like the jacket and the shape that it has, but it is definitely not warm enough for Michigan weather."
5,Sharon,"Sharon has become very near to me. She is to me as a spirit guide who, having led John through his life, comes to me and leads me forward. There is nothing but good vibes coming from this book. You won't be let down, or hurt. I could not put it down, and every break at work, every lunch, and each night, Sharon was with me."
4,an album of elegance,"mr. roberts returns to the trio format of ""time and circumstance"" (1997) with this wonderfully elegant album. unlike songbook albums, mr. roberts does not work through selections from duke ellington's canon, but instead explores ""ellingtonia"" as he sees it. the result is a restrained album full of the lyricism and soul of ellington, but partnered with the classicism of roberts. jason marsalis is developing into a fine drummer adding yet another jewel to the family crown and roland guerin is a revelation on bass with some beautiful solos. if one were to seek comparisons, this trio reminds me a great deal of bill evans later piano trios-- intellectually lyrical."
5,A Great Read,"""The Last Campaign"" is political history at its best. With the current campaign settling into a dull gray, how refreshing it was to read about colorful candidates spouting interesting ideas. Karabell writes beautifully and has an eye for the amusing and the provocative. I highly recommend ""The Last Campaign."""
3,Room for improvemnet in an otherwise interesting book,"I have to agree with the reviewer below me that the book was a bit shallow and misinformed at times. I couldn't understand why the author wrote about the two fringe candidates as much as he did about Harry Truman and Tom Dewey. Even when discussing the real players, the book drifted at times. Nevertheless, these disappointments were compensated by the storyline itself: perhaps the most interesting and surprising presidential election of the twentieth century. If you're interested in the 1948 vote or Cold War politics, this is a fine book. Otherwise, leave it off your Mothers' Day shopping list."
2,"Pass on this one, but not this band!","Nothing stands out on this album. If you want to hear Single Gun Theory at its best, listen to ""Flow, River of My Soul."" This has to be one of the most creative albums of its genre."
5,Contains one of the kewlest dance tracks ever.,"""Exorcise This Wasteland"" rocked the alternative dance scene in the early 90's. It is a must have."
3,Peacefully introspective,"For those of you who adore Tanya Donnelly like myself and have loved her since the glory days of Throwing Muses, The Breeders, and Belly, do not look for more of the same from Tanya on Whiskey Tango Ghosts. That's not to say that this album is bad or even lacking; it is, however, vastly divergent from the invigorating and life-affirming timelessness of Star.The entire album is unplugged (big surprise!) and incredibly introspective, if not somewhat listless at times. Although admittedly, this album will take a few listens to be fully appreciated, it nonetheless fails to galvanize and energize like the Tanya of old did. Overall, I found it to be enjoyable and even profound at times, just not as exciting."
3,Nice---but wanted more..,"Being a beginner when it comes to Photoshop & reading the reviews I purchased the book. It is very nice, visually stunning and very well written, however most of the screen shots are for MAC while the written explanations are Windows based. The book covers each step briefly, yet maintains a level that everyone can understand. It left me wanting much more...Nevertheless; I find it very useful as a reference manual because of the short, brief & concise explanations."
2,Broke Three Days After Warranty Expired,I loved this camera until it broke three days after the warranty ran out. Kodak says it is aware that there is a recurring problem with the lens cover suddenly not working but they won't repair it and don't offer any assistance for the repair. Boo on Kodak!
4,Great Camera,"This is a great compact camera that is easy to use and at the same time is capable to do more. The viewfinder or digital display is large enough to see your photos. The resolution is great. The dock is a wierd design, but you do not have to use it. Overall I am very pleased with this camera."
2,PS to my previous review,"I just saw a thing on ABC News Primetime last night---Arthur Leigh Allen, by DNA comparison (from his autopsy, and saliva from the flaps of authentic Zodiac letters) isn't the Zodiac killer. Several other suspects were eliminated by DNA comparison also. I guess everyone needs to return to the drawing board."
2,Genetics Prove Graysmith Wrong!,"Although his book ""Zodiac"" is the ultimate guide to the Zodiac killer case, a genetic ""fingerprint"" has now been produced from the material off of several of the Zodiac letters. Graysmith's ""revealed"" suspect, none other than Arthur Leigh Allen, has now been eliminated as a suspect by SF police. Bad timing for Mr. Graysmith I am afraid! Still, I recommend Graysmith's other book ""Zodiac"" highly."
1,Arthur Leigh Allen was proven to not be the Zodiac,"I have not read this book, but if it focuses solely on Arthur Leigh Allen, then it is a waste of time. I just saw this case profiled on Cold Case Files on A & E last night. After Allen died, samples of his DNA were taken as well as finger and hand prints. They were then compared to DNA and palm prints taken from a authenticated Zodiac letter. (The one that he sent a piece of one victim's bloody clothing with) Both the DNA from licking th envelope and the palm print on the letter do not match. His DNA and prints were compared to what was found on the other letters as well, and there was no match whatsoever. Arthur Leigh Allen may have been weird and troubled, but he was not the Zodiac Killer."
2,What a disappointment!,"Overall, Ms. Hunt interprets Bach's gorgeous music in a mannered, unidiomatic and--yes--unmusical fashion. Her dynamic range is too wide for Baroque music and the quality of her sound often inappropriate. Even her pitch is unfocused. This is, I'm afraid, not her repertoire. Incidentally, it's good to hear a nicely intoned oboe d'amore."
3,Addendum to my earlier note. On cantata 82,"If you can find the Victor or Victrola LP of Mack Harrel's 82. please. please listen to it:""Of that of which we cannot speak, we must remain silent."""
5,One of the Two Best CDs of the Year,"This is simply one of the most beautiful, heart rending performances captured from any studio by any artist at any time. Too many superlatives? Give it a listen.Nearly everyone I've played this for has had the same reaction. A tightening of the face, narrowing of the eyes and a connection between heart and head that is almost disconcerting. Mrs. Hunt Lieberson goes to the very soul of Bach's profound music, finds every nuance and without eschewing her formidable technique, lets loose in this music which has rarely been sung this beautifully with a seemingly inherent understanding and of each works richness and complexity. This is a singer born to sing this music.This and Hunt Lieberson's Handel albums are THE must have discs of 2004."
2,Not their best,"Black '47 has put out a few albums since ""Fire of Freedom"" and tweaked their sound, but none have ever topped their first, or even come close. ""Fire of Freedom"" is as close as Black '47 got to a masterpiece. This album has a few fun tracks (most notably ""Those Saints""), but otherwise they're mostly blah. Black '47 is a great live band, though, so if you already have ""Fire of Freedom,"" get their live album before you get this or any other Black '47 album."
4,Good training,The book provides you a guide to design a workout tailored to your abilities to improve your fitness and increase your performance in the game of bowling
2,Misleading product.,"I bought 8 sets of the string lights thinking that they would link together like a series circuit. However, when I was taking them out of the boxes I noticed they only had one plug per set. But the weird thing is that like other string lights, the plugs have holes in them for another one to connect to it, but not from the opposite end. Meaning, I could connect all 8 sets to one another, but they would all be starting from the same place and serving no purpose.Therefore, do not buy this product as you cannot use it as you may think. I am in the processes of trying to return them now."
5,Superbly well written book on grief.,Grollman's long experience as a grief counsellor is evidenced here in his concise and empathic coverage of all aspects of the grief one may experience in the loss of someone close. It is by far the best book on grief I have ever read and was of immense benefit to me following the death of my wife.
5,Very comforting when one is grieving...,"The book I found most helpful, nd keep reading over, as I try t deal with a tragic and painful loss..."
2,Not a Gentle Book,Other reviewers describe this book as gentle. It was definitely not gentle for me -- my husband has been gone two months and this book shattered me like glass. Reality is fine and we all need to seek it at our own pace after a loss but this book hits you in the face with it. I am glad others have found it helpful but to me it was devastating. I felt wounded and was useless for the whole day I read it.
1,I read all the great feed back and really this book is a waste,"This book was a waste of money and time. I read it in 15 minutes. There are books so much more helpful with realinformation, I would say DO NOT BUY IT"
4,I like it,I founda lot of information in the book. I read it about everynight after homework. I am still choosing the right dog for me and my kid sister.
5,Great loss of life,"Dave Bryceson's (1997) book is the culmination of years of painstaking research and what is, for the author, an enduring fascination for the impact of this great maritime disaster not only upon the lives of those who perished and their relatives, but also the great sense of public participation in the private grief of those affected by it.Just very occassionally, in more modern times, a great human catastrophe affects a whole nation or group of nations. Not so much because of the number of people killed or injured, but for reasons that are more subtle than that.'The Titanic Disaster' captures the effect upon ordinary people of this enormous public tragedy, through a collection of press reports, announcements and published photographs which followed the events of 14th and 15th April 1912."
3,Accurate but not in depth.,"This book is accurate with VERY few errors. It covers all the topics required for the exam but not in the depth required to pass the exam. This book is good on installation and configuration issues but weak on the theory behind topics such as WINS and IP ADDRESSING. This being my first MCSE 2000 exam, I failed it the first time around. A lot of question that came out weren't covered in the book. This book should be complemented with another book. I read Mark Minasi's Windows 2000 server(Fantastic book, I give it a triple 5 star rating). I passed the exam second time around. A WORD OF WARNING MCSE 2000 EXAMS ARE MUCH MORE DEMANDING THAN PREVIOUS EXAMS. I HAD A FIXED LENGTH EXAM 55 QUESTIONS IN 2HOURS 35 MINUTES. I FINISHED WITH 1 MINUTE TO SPARE. THE REASON IS THAT A GOOD 85% OF THE QUESTIONS ARE SCENARIO BASED,WITH MULTIPLE ANSWERS. THIS REQUIRES ATTENTION TO DETAIL ALSO AFTER 90 MINUTES YOU ARE MENTALLY DRAINED."
4,Good live set from the Chieftains,"This ia a 1988 live set from the Chieftians, recorded in Boston and Toronto, doing what they do best: traditional Irish music. This was before they branched out into recording with pop and country musicians. Of particular interest here are the solos, where you can hear the individual musicians and their traditional instruments. The CD is just over 40 minutes and a worthwhile souveneir of this period- 4.5 Stars."
5,Awesome book!,"An excellent book for any parent with teenagers of dating age. Easy to read, understand, and talk about with your child! It gives clear, concise, and fun examples about what a healthy dating relationship can (and should) look like!"
1,Please,"Can we insult the intelligence of the reader here? Moderate Republicans don't defend a book that is blatantly visceral in its attack. I sure wish the authors would stop writing reviews on their own books and allow people, third parties, review their book instead of the obvious attempt to skew review counts in their favor."
5,DARREN AND DANIEL DID IT AGAIN!,"The first time I heard ""I knew I loved you"" I absolutely fell in love with the song. The lyrics and the melody blew me away. The album is very personal and comes from the heart's deepest places. Affirmation is one of those album in which you could listen to every song. All of the songs on this album are very memorable and contain lyrics that is so hard to forget. This is album is very beautifully written and very poetic. I REALLY REALLY recommend this album for everyone. This is the one album you will not be disappointed in!"
1,Get rusty easily,Installed these clips in the bathroom mirror last October and now it is February and they are showing visible signs of rust.
4,Just what I needed,"Item was as described and was just what I was looking for. the price and shipping were good too. Thank you, it did the job just as I expected it to do."
2,A good but outdated book on home exchange,"The Authors are experienced home exchangers and did a great job writing this book in 1991. They surveyed over 500 exchangers to get their information and stories. The problem with the book is that the Internet has completely changed Home Exchange, as has the availability of technology such as cell phones and personal computers. If you want to read entertaining essays and stories about home exchanges between 1960 and 1990 and want to understand the pre-Internet home exchange world this is an entertaining book. The cartoons are amusing."
5,Love this book!,"Wow, I grabbed this because I liked the cover. I'd never heard of 'paranormal romance' before, (I work in a bookstore, I grab books at random alot!).This book turned out way better than anything I was expecting. Normally any romance novel I read I forget about a week or two down the line. This book was different in that the romance took a back seat to the story and actual character development (something completely unheard of in most romance novels).It's a Cinderella story, a mystery, a romance, historical, paranormal--and an all around good story.Abe has created a world that I would love to see her explore again, her new take on dragons is amazing, and so totally creative. I am in awe of her word-smithing and would happiy hunt down another one of her books."
1,A Love Story of Shape Shifting Dragons,"Sorry I just blew the who pltt of the book. Simple, and at times too sappy. Wanted some excitement and maybe some swordplay, ended up with a romace between to dragons in a victorian setting... Yawn."
1,BEWARE...NOT WORTH YOUR TIME READING!!!,"I will not go into the details of this book as other reviewers have already done that, however, I must inform you that this book is horrible & is not worth your time reading!!!DO NOT waste your time & money....the book is slow, boring, not interesting enough to read & to top it off the girl gets raped...so beware for non-adult readers!... but...even for adults it is a useless piece!I wish I had not bought it & will not be buying from this author again...as I do not believe she is very good!"
1,"Not for kids, and a waste of my time","I thought this looked like a nice series for my 13 year old daughter, to help pique her interest in books, since her best friend has the whole series. I enjoy fantasy, and thought it was fairly well written to start.Wrong. I will not let my daughter read these. I only read this one, but it was enough. As other 1-star reviews have said, the hero is a bully who thinks rape is not a problem as long as he's overwhelmed by lust, which he barely disguises as love in his own mind. If you don't want your kids reading graphic descriptions of sexual intercourse, avoid this series."
3,didn't love it,"Why didn't I love this book? I'm not sure; the story had a lot to love...dragons, alpha male trying to woo his lady love. A heroine who is strong and stands up to those who try to bring her down.I think I couldn't completely enjoy the book because parts of the dragon culture bothered me. To protect themselves, the dragons kill those who try to leave the dragon community and live among humans. The dragon council was made up of domineering men and Kit, the dragon leader and hero, didn't have a supportive comrade. The author's excuse was that it's the way of the 'drakon' but it felt stifling."
4,Great Product,"This product could very well be a 5 star. I have only used it once, when I went out of town for 5 days, and I was not disappointed. I have tested it a few times, and it has not failed to kick in. I have not left it on for a month continuously, and that will be the true test, but so far, I am very pleased.I live in a hurricane zone, and this is the time to be prepared, and having this product is a must."
1,What the hell caused this trainwreck?,"I'm an incredibly avid Hooverphonic fan. I bought all their albums on the release dates and have never been disappointed... until now. What were they thinking releasing this under the Hooverphonic name? It's a complete bastardization! Perhaps they should have released it under a pseudonym, kind of like what XTC did when they released their Dukes of Stratosphear album. But either way, this album was terrible."
1,benny goodman carneie hall,"Disk quality is very poor on some of the tracks. It sounds like the CDs were made from a record in that there are annoying scratching sounds on some of the tracks.I also received the same CD from my son as a Christmas present, and when I played it, the same sounds were there. Now I have to return both of them. Bummer!"
2,A Great Show Ruined by Static,"I have the original LPs of this recording and they have aged (50 yrs old). I think this concert was the acme of Jazz in the 30's and 40's. I was expecting a clear, crisp recording on this CD, but am highly disappointed by the noticeable and very distracting static present throughout the 2 discs. This is especially evident in the band (#14 on disc 2) which contains ""Sing Sing Sing,"" which, to me, is the ""signature"" number of this concert. In addition, the producer has added recordings of comments by BG at the end of Disc 2, which were introductions to specific numbers, but without any music following. It is like having a reference in the back of a book and having to go back in the text to find out to what it referred. These should have been injected before to number being described or else omitted. They made no sense where they were. It was as if the producers needed fillers to complete allotted time of the disc."
5,Benny Rides Again...,"All right all ready about the hiss and pops. This album is exciting. The additional music and the vibrancy make it worth the price of admission--plus.I've probably listened to the previous version, on LPs and CDs, as often as anyone and I'm glad to have this in my collection."
1,Nothing works with this Instant Video,Have rented and purchased this video. It freezes at 20:22 whether I try to see it from the video library or download to Unbox. Have already tried uninstalling and reinstalling Unbox. Nothing works with this video.
2,The Snake and The Spider,"I just read Ms. Kinksbury's book and there where things in it that didn't ring true because she didn't dig deep enough. She never disclosed the real name of Spider or that he was 18 years old, not 22 when the murders took place. He told the truth about what happened and nearly paid for it with his life, while his partner was made to look like a hero. Anyone who thinks he didn't cry over what happened to those two boys and himself doesn't know what their talking about. He's not the animal they have labelled him to be. Just a very messed up kid who didn't care anymore......"
5,Wow!,"Another wonderful story by Elizabeth Lowell. ""Lover In The Rough"" had me hooked from the very first pages, couldn't put in down."
4,A Sight for Sore Eyes,"I picked up this book in the... bin at the local bookstore, and I couldn't believe my luck. The book is worth owning for the photography alone - beautiful, spare, art quality photographs of everything from fruits to oils to seafood to meat to herbs and spices.On the minus side, this book does not supply in-depth information about any ingredients. If you are looking for that sort of comprehensive information, you are better off choosing a book like ""The Joy of Cooking"" or ""How to Cook Everything.""If, however, you want a feast for the eyes, this worth well more than the money I paid for it."
3,good but slow,R.L. Stine has done it again with another monster blood book.Evan Ross grows to gigantic size after eating monster blood.
2,Sheds A Lot,"I've had this bed for over one year now. It has maintained it's shape and the dog still loves it. Very easy to pick up and cart about - it's light and portable. The downside is that the fluff from the bed goes all over the place; it sheds really badly. The shedding from the bed is so bad that I can really only use one side of the mattress pad/bottom cushion. The bottom cushion is reversible - fabric on one side and fluff on the other - but because the bed sheds so much both sides end up looking fluffy. The bed is ok, but I would look for a sale and not pay too much for it."
2,Sheddy beddy,"The bed arrived quickly and is beautiful, however, the fur lining sheds everywhere even after washing the entire bed and pad. I would not buy it again because of the shedding issue."
4,Great for feminine care and post delivery,"I am in my third trimester, I bought this bidet in preparation for my delivery, hoping it will provide great feminine hygiene. It does what it supposed to do. Thanks to my handy hubby, installation is not a problem, just put a lot of tape to prevent any leakages."
1,Poor video quality,"The dvd skipped in several segments. I played it in my SUV entertainment system and also in my home system and the same ""skips"" occurred. I could not see visibly see any ""deflects"" on the DVD itself. Did not send it back as having to pay shipping was not worth it.....not blaming the supplier....just not a quality copy from the producer....."
1,This book is not worth your money!,"I am not sure why the author bothered to write this book. I guess he needed some money but how he found a publisher is a mystery to me. This book is unintelligible, boring, stupid, pointless, confusing, obscure, convuluted and frustrating. It's rare, thankfully, that other authors don't have such utter contempt and disregard for their readers as this one does."
5,Wonderful sequel to Isle of Lies,"Brianna Cameron is the widow of an abusive husband. She is content to live with her brother Ian and sister-in-law Moira(hero and heroine from Isle of Lies). Brianna is the only survivor of terrible coach accident and is rescued by a mysterious stranger. Royce, Brianna's savior in warrior's clothing, is himself healing from a battle which left him scarred and bruised. He tends to Brianna with kindness and both of them heal both physically and mentally. With this healing comes a love that they had both wished for....but, unfortunately they don't live HEA right away. A scheme hatched by Brianna's presumed dead husband rips them apart on their wedding day. How can they be man and wife when Brianna's husband comes back to claim his wife? What will happen to the relationship that Brianna and Royce share? BUY THIS BOOK to find would how the story ends! This book is definitely a keeper!"
5,Interesting from beginning to end,This is a very fine novel; it seems so real.You really feel for the characters.The writer creates scene after scene of believable episodes.It's an easy read and very clean. A good family book.
3,It's a teaser,"It's a fine album, so why did I walk away feeling let down? Perhaps its because there were so many changes between the original production and ""SP2,"" and relatively few of those changes are reflected in the hybrid Encore album. Why include Rex Smith singing a lyrically unchanged version of ""Where's the Girl"" and NOT ""Madame Guillotine,"" which would have been very different from the first CD? Why include the concept album version of ""You Are My Home"" and NOT the wedding song version used in SP2? Rachel York's ""Storybook"" and ""I'll Forget You"" are priceless. Rex Smith's ""Falcon in the Dive"" was a wonderful reflection of the energy he brought to the role. I don't regret buying the CD, but I would be excited to see a revival CD that would be a truer reflection of SP2 in the future."
2,WHY; WILDHORN? ARE YOU THAT GREEDY?,"I heard this CD, and the only word I have for Fran Wildhorn is this: SHAMELESS! Please, don't buy it. Rachel York sings like a godess, and Rex Smith actually sings, unlike Terrence Mann, but why aren't they on all recordings? Why didn't Frank do a real new recording. And guess what? He's says that this one is for us, the fans. Well, I think this one is just for his own bank account. I'd rather hear Rachel York my whole life through, instead of hearing the unbearable and untalented voice of Christine Andreas. if you do this again Frank, no ones gonna buy your CDs"
5,Outstanding book... aspiring writer.,"What is most notable about this awe inspiring, heartfelt first novel from George Ha is how well he creates his own teenage character, struggling to fit in his modern day high school world. He is a loner, he is a geek, call him what you want, but he is definitely an inspiration to those of us who really struggled through high school, or are currently struggling. His well thought out emotional entries comfort us, knowing that in this crazy world, we aren't alone.I recommend this book to those of you who enjoyed Perks of Being a Wallflower or Catcher in the Rye. His Holden/Charlie-esque way of looking at things may just bring a smile to your face or a tear to your eye. He has an entry for just about everything.VERY awesome book. Great things to come from this young gifted author."
4,It's about time we had another China Bayles mystery!,"I always look forward to these books, and this one did not disappoint. China and her friend Ruby are pulled into an old murder that seems to tie up with a new one. Brian, China's fourteen year-old stepson, finds the remains of a skeleton on an archeological dig. This skeleton, though interesting, has no historical significance becasue it had only been in the cave for about thirty years. It turns out that the body found had been shot, and China and Ruby, each being extremely curious, are trying to identify the body. The identification leads them on to a newer, fresh lead and before long they are on the tail of a cold-blooded murderer. I love these books for the characters, and also for the interesting information about herbs that Ms. Albert literally sprinkles in with the book. China never disappoints."
1,"Art beautiful, hero a boor","I thought the art in this comic was some of the best I've seen in the harlequin manga line. But I confess I hated the story. The hero was a jerk who hired this woman to be his secretary, and then when she travels with him to Italy, tells everyone she is a fiancée because he is afraid his 90 year old grandmother will die if she learns that he isn't really engaged. (He was previously engaged to a woman who looked just like the heroine). Then he leaves on business, stealing the heroine's passport so she cannot leave Italy. Somehow in this process the heroine has a car wreck and falls for this manipulative guy, who while not especially villainous, has basically hired her under false pretenses and controlled her and has been dishonest with her.I disliked the plot and struggled to finish this one- which is too bad. The art was spectacular."
3,"Great book, horrible edit","This duo is an awesome set of books compiled into one. If you really enjoy the thoughts of war and those of a monarch, you would find this book amazing. The editing in this edition of the book is poor at best and in some places has completely taken away the emphasis of statements.I personally went out of my way to purchase this book because I have heard so many great things about Machiavelli and his school of thought. This book only reinforces my view of him and his work. You won't find things equivocated in this text; only cut and dry info for every man/woman who plans to take over the world, or possibly a small country."
3,A few coins short of a pot of gold.........,"Mariah Carey.Thats the name of one of pops most highest paid singers.She kept her fans in suspence,with her song,""heartbreaker"" which hit #1,giving her yet another hit.Her 15 #1,""Thank god I found you"",is also included on the album.But,really,there are some flaws.Some of the songs are absolutly awful.""Bliss"" sounds like birds chirping and other pretty sounds to hide the dusdurbing lyrics.""bliss"" chourus is ""ON and On and on ON and On and on""and it really does.The song is not fun,but instead tedois,and you will be praying that it will end.The song is over five minutes long.""Heartbreaker"" is a nice song,bounchy and fun,but the remix,which features Missy Elliot and Da Brat,has no charm due to the obsenites that come from the rappers mouth's.I found the remix to be a little boring.""Did I do that"" Is sexy,but the man's screaming voice cancels out mariah's. Overall,this is a nice CD,but some of the songs are really bad."
5,"I never get tired of her, how about you?","The un-diva's newest is also her best, but then, I'm biased. Best jams are the ""Heartbreaker"" remix with Da Brat (who may end up changing her name, 'cause she ain't no kid no more, if ya know whut I mean) and Missy and the Snoop cut...but see, Mariah can sing a telephone book and it'll sound good to me. Love the cover, too."
3,not Mariah's best for sure,"I am a big fan of Mariah's, but I was very disappointed in the new ""Rainbow"" album. I am sorry to say that the only song I bought the album for is ""Heartbreaker.""I think her music in the early 90's was much, much better. I'm not sure if she's white or black."
2,Mariah's second worse album.,"The first being ""Emotions.""Track 1: Heartbreaker 10/10. The best song on the album.Track 2: Can't Take That Away 9/10. A sweet song.Track 3: Bliss 2/10. It's too long, plus it's a very weak song.Track 4: How Much 2/10. Sounds like something from 1996.Track 5: After Tonight 3/10. Sounds like ""My All"" part 2.Track 6: X-Girlfriend 2/10. It's on the wrong album.Track 7: Heartbreaker 5/10. I hate this remix. But Missy Elliott and Da Brat are funny like always.Track 8: Vulnerability 1/10. Mariah, please no more interludes!Track 9: Against All Odds 1/10. The worst Marah cover.Track 10: Cry Baby 9/10. I really like this one.Track 11: Did I Do That 3/10. Half Mariah song, Half Mystikal song. Make up your mind which is it?!Track 12: Petals 9/10. Very personal.Track 13: Rainbow 1/10 Mariah, please nooooooo interludes!Track 14: Thank God I Found You 10/10. The second best song on the album."
1,Shrieky strikes again,"Mariah Carey's final album for Sony is one of the worst records ever made. Every song is pure crap. Her cover of Phil Collins' Against All Odds was God-awful(it was as bad as Mariah's desecration of Def Leppard's Bringing on the Heartbreak and that Aussie kangaroo Kylie Minogue's version of The Locomotion). Heartbreaker(which featured Jay-Z aka Mr. Beyonde Owls) and Crybaby are pure garbage. Every song here is a classic example of crap. Original music from an original artist is by Portishead, whose singer Beth Gibbons makes Mariah look idiotic in comparison with her incredible vocal range. Avoid this awful rainbow and buy Ritchie Blackmore's Rainbow's Rising which is a real musical pot of gold, that's for sure!"
5,she can do it again!,"with thank god i found you rising in the charts she will soon make another fantasy with her may be 15th number one song on the billboard!can;t take that away is another sure win hit and against all odds may be a dark horse, after tonight hopefully can see its day!"
4,mariah is on fire,i really think that mariah is the best singer and i would love to meet her one day. her songs are really good and they stick with me throughout the day.she is really talented and i hope she comes out with another cd.
5,Bliss,"From the reviews that I have read, it seems that the negative comments are always too focused on her image rather than the music itself. All that aside, the music speaks for itself. If you love listening to Mariah's sultry alto, check out Petals and Rainbow (interlude). If you miss the ""whistle register"" (I believe they are called flagellos), check out Bliss and Heartbreaker. If you love the ballads, check out the terrific After Tonight and the remake of Against All Odds. I guess what I'm trying to say is that there's something for everybody here, so if you dislike her for no apparent reason, your opinions don't count. True, the songwriting has not differed much from the Butterfly album, but why does one think that change equals a good album? I say, if you've got the right formula, stick to it! It didn't sell 3x platinum for no reason."
3,Mariah................trying to take it to the next level,"This new one from mariah is a solid cd. I think that she was trying to do something different. At first I said that it was weak, but when I really listened to it, it started to grow on me. Out of all the songs on the cd, 9 songs stand out. For 9 songs I think it is worth it. If you are not a mariah fan then you might want to stay clear of it...then again you might not. This is the closest she ever went to hip/hop but at the same time keeping the old style. Songs like ""petals"" and ""X-girlfriend"" will have you thinking who she is talking about because the lyrics just make you think. The title might make you roll your eyes but if you really listen you will see that its a few tracks thats really tight.Overall this was a good album(not her best)..but good."
1,HORRIBLE !!!!!!,"From class to trash... That album cover suits more a single cover shot!!! sounds all the same. Like I said her peak was 1995/96 after The mega smash DAYDREAM CD. mariah just went down hill, But however Rainbow Hit #2 on the charts, gave her 2 more #1's.. sold in the U.S over 3 million copies. So is mariah the number one female act ?"
3,Taste The Rainbow....... STOP! it's poison!,"If you were to line up all of mariah's albums side by side, ""Rainbow"" is truely Mariah's worst cd of all time. I hate saying that, because I'm a huge fan but it's a non-biased oppinion. Ironically, amazon's review says ""Against All Odds"" is the weakest track on the cd and that happens to be one of my faves! This album is all over the place, some of the interludes are better than some of the actual songs if that tells you anything. 'Rainbow"" also includes one of the worst mariah songs of all time in my oppinion, which is ""Thank God I Found You"". What was she thinking, oh wait, SHE WASN'T THINKING, when she did a duet with 98 degrees. Where are they now? who cares. You can't even pick off 5 songs off this cd that you absolutely love, like on other Mariah albums. ""After 2Nite"" is ok, ""Heartbreaker"" is ok, and that's the problem, it's all just ok. ""Thank God I Found"" other mariah carey albums to listen to."
2,"""Emotions"" is still her best cd....","I had a lot of expectations from this album, considering ""Butterfly"" was a disappointment. I figured she would put out a great album this time. I was wrong. She is trying too hard to make everyone happy. The only two tracks that are great are ""Against All Odds"" and ""Petals"". They are sure fire Number Ones. Her version of the Phil Collins song puts his to shame. But the rest of the album is a blur. And what was she thinking when she made that cover? Does she think that 99% of her fans are guys?"
5,Can You Believe This?,"I really hated Mariah Carey before... But I when I heard some sample of this album, I began to like her... She is really being honest with her music and herself and I really like her hip-hop musics. Also Jimmy-Jam and Terry Lewis songs are unbelieveable! This album, I think shows the vision of her being the diva of the 21 century. Ballads songs and high notes cannot be the options for the 21 century diva!"
3,What Happened to Mariah?,"I lost Mariah when she released BUTTERFLY. She's trying too hard to be R&B & HipHop. I mean, ""Dreamlover"" was a great R&B song, one of my favorites by any artist , But after BUTTERFLY, it's just hard to listen to. She has a beautiful voice, but all she does is whisper on a lil' weak voice on this Album. ""Bliss"" & ""Against All Odds"" are examples. Only until the end of ""Against All Odds"" does she let loose. She just doesn't have it anymore, no matter how good her voice is. But I give her 3 stars for effort on trying something new."
5,Still the greatest!,"Its amazing that after all of her great albums she still does not let her fans down. Its a great album, Cry Baby is a great track and so is Mariah's Theme. I saw her on MTV and she was great, i wish people would stop with all the gossip and stop being jelous, she happens to be an extremely talented artist,, the kind we only see every so often. Rainbow is great, i liked butterfly better but it it is still great!"
2,Disappointing,"Mariah has lost her touch. This album can't compare with its predecessors. On #1's, the songs were lovely, almost enough to make one cry. ""Rainbow"" literally brings tears-because it's such a letdown. Mariah screeches, sounding as if she has laryngitis. On most songs, she howls with background vocalists and superfluous rap artists. She's better by herself on ballads. The only good songs on this CD are(in order from best to not quite as good) ""Against All Odds"", ""Can't Take That Away"", ""Heartbreaker"", and ""Thank God I Found You"". I identify so much with those. To others who are considering purchasing this CD, buy those 4 songs as singles if you can. And Mariah, take a break and rest from performing so your beautiful voice will return."
4,Awesome!,"This is a 'must-own' CD from Mariah. It contains some of her best hits such as ""Heartbreaker"", ""Can't Take That Away (Mariah's Theme)"" and ""Thank God I Found You"". This album includes vocals from ""Jay-Z"", ""Usher"", ""Da Brat"", ""Missy Elliott"", ""Snoop Dogg"", ""Joe"" and ""98 Degrees"". This album comes with a mini poster inside. So, own her ""Rainbow"" CD now!"
3,Where Did This Butterfly's Wings Go?,"I have loved Mariah since Vision and was disapointed even when I saw the cover. That girl does not need to dress like Britney to get attention. As for the CD, it was completely AVARAGE! It was a display of an avarage artist. Mariah is not the avarage artist; she is capable of so much more. Butterfly, Fantasy and all the rest are ten times more beautiful and meaningful. Of course, she has some awesome ""Mariah"" songs (Can't Take That Away, Petals and Thank God I Found You) but most are just ordinary (How Much, Heartbreaker) and others make me cringe (Bliss, Crybaby and Did I Do That). Seriously, what's the difference between ""Heartbreaker got the best of me"" and ""Dreamlover come rescue me""? Sing both lines to yourself and the parallel is obvious. If you want some real magic, pick up Butterfly. She really can move you despite Rainbow's apathetic attempt."
4,Ravaged by boy bands? Find solace under the rainbow.,"When I first listened to Mariah Carey's Rainbow, I was bored by it. I favored the brighter, bubblegum-packed tracks of the infamous boy bands. But months later, after finally struggling out of their forceful grasp, I reconsidered the Cd and felt quite different about it than I had initially. After being brainwashed by inadequate voices and simple lyrics, I was rather impressed by Mariah's capabilities. Not only does she have the most amazing voice, but she can actually write intelligent songs. Tracks such as ""Can't Take That Away"", ""After Tonight"" and ""Petals"" are sung with such convincing emotion that you'll find yourself swept up into Mariah's triumphs and tragedies. And whenever the taste for a little bubblegum comes back, there are a few tracks like ""Heartbreaker"" to satisfy the craving."
5,mariah carey the soraing butterfly,rainbow album push her career to another level. she displayed many different views and genres of music in her current album and its wonderful and pleasant to see the change!
4,Different from her usual...,"This c-d is very different from her usual c-ds, but it deserves a couple listenings to. I am not very used to her new ""hip hop"" style, but most of the songs were well written. It did not deserve 5 stars because songs like petals and bliss are stupid. I liked all the other songs especially ""Rainbow"" and ""Heartbreaker"". Overall this is a pretty nice cd. It could have been better, though."
3,"Same Old, Same Old","This cd is exactly like her other 6 cds, (with the exeption of her christmas album). Her sound has not changed one bit. I've always liked her voice, but 14 songs that sound about the same? Personally, I'm getting a little tired of her style. Heartbreaker is ok, but it's way over played. She has a good voice, i think she can do more with it."
4,Rainbow review,"Hey all, if u haven't gotten this CD, GO AND GET IT NOW! Although it's not one of her best cd's, it's still a great one. Some of my favorites on RAINBOW are: Heartbreaker, and the remix, Against all odds, After Tonight, and the Rainbow interlude. However, the best song onthe cd in my opinion is Can't Take That Away. It's such an inspirational song. And it's so great that she dedicated her AMA to the kids from the Make a Wish Foundation."
4,MARIAH IS BACK,"M.C is back with another album. When I first heard Heartbreaker I was like oh great another lackluster album from the music industry's top singers.I hoped her entire CD would be better and I'm proud to say it is. Some of her song are beautifully executed and others can be pitched ( aka Heartbreaker-both versions. and Did I Do That)Well if you cant decide whethe or not you should get it, please do, you most likely wont be dissapointed( unless you just can't stand urban/rap/ghetto music)Thanks Mariah and at least this makes up for that piece of trash you called Butterfly."
5,Inspirational and Beautiful,"I have always loved Mariah's songs and I think that she deserves every bit of credit she gets. Her latest album is as much inspiring as her previous ones. FYI, Mariah and Celine should not be compared, because they have totally different styles. I absolutely love 'Mariah's Theme' and broke down in tears the first time I heard it. It's really touching. I could really relate to every word. Heartbreaker, however sounds a lot like the opening singles of her previous albums. Anyway why are the anti mariah freaks bitching about her tendency to remake songs, Celine does the same."
2,What's wrong with Mariah?,"Let me start by saying, I have all her albums. This album is, however, one I can do without.Signs of trouble started with her last album, BUTTERFLY. Her voice is not what it once was. Her voice was the power behind her work. Not many artist can say that. Her re-make of Phil Collins song is a travesty. The albums is not all bad, but her peak is long gone. ""Heartbreaker"" is a catchy song but it's the only hit worthy song on RAINBOW. There definitly will not be another ""#1's"" album.She needs to take along break, work on her voice and hire new producers, and come back with another albums that is worthy of her talent.Sorry, Mariah fans!"
3,"Good Product, Bad Support","The Bravo II is an excellent burner and printer but they've been promising for 2 years now that 64 bit drivers will be out soon, most bravo owners are sure they mean never at this point but aren't willing to give up sales."
3,"Not perfect, but a good product","No major complaints. Set it and forget it. It works in the background.Some improvements I'd like to see: 1) Disc burns could be faster. I'm burning CD's, which takes at least five minutes per disc. 2) The included driver didn't work for Mac Leopard, but Primera's customer support was great. A real person answered the phone, they were fast, and they solved the problem with an updated program. 3) With every job, the burning program automatically selects the computer's default printer and not the duplicator printer. It should default to its own printer rather than the user having to select it every print job.These things are not ""deal breakers."" It's just nice to know that before the purchase is made."
5,What I Wanted,"three very cool wrist band. It was a good value at a better price. however, they were for a friend. (GO BREWERS!!!!)"
5,Gotta have these things,"I was thrilled to find these. Twenty years ago I had some in the Colo Rockies and like a nut, did not bring them to live in the desert. Who needs them in Vegas? I DO! As I sit in winter and read or watch TV at night, that little space between my sockies and jammies gets cold. My legs are always cold while lounging. These are cool because they are cute, very soft and slide right on without being tight."
5,When Is Her Next Book Coming Out?,"How refreshing to read a story in the order it doesn't happen! Saves me from flipping back and forth between chapters. I liked May. Weeks after reading SEVEN LOVES, I still feel Trueblood's characters are carrying on nearby."
4,The Play of Memory,"""I got a mother done gone onMakes me feel like my time ain't long.Could this have been sung at her mother's funeral?"" (p. 205)This passage shows a snippet of the play of memory in May's mind as she reviews her life while living her life.There are many reasons for reading this book, but read it at least once as a treatise on memory and--for writers--as a study on updated stream-of-consciousness.Valerie Trueblood lives and writes from the Northwest. ""Seven Loves"" is flooded with natural imagery. The memory of a seal threads through, and then seals the book.--Janet Grace Riehl, author Sightlines: A Poet's Diary"
4,"Poetic, contemplative, and tender","This quiet novel follows the story of 74-year-old May Nilsson, a retired English teacher and widow, who finds herself reminiscing on a past defined by love. May remembers the difficult and pleasurable years of her marriage to a doctor as well as the excitement and pain of an extramarital affair. She reflects on a young coworker's elementary nature, her son's capriciousness, and her mother's political convictions. Each chapter presents an impressionistic view of May's family, friends, and lovers and their varying degrees of longing and happiness. Gently told, this novel is poetic, contemplative, and tender--a bit like a tone poem."
3,Just ok,"The back and forth of the timeframe of the story was interesting and I liked the story. I've never read a book that flowed like this, so I was pleased at that. Other than that, I was slightly bored ... but I read it quick so it kept my interest!"
2,A great guitarist doth not a great album make,"The guitar is good, the singing adequate, the lyrics very bad indeed. This sounds somewhat like Pete Townsend on his worst day ever (however, I'm not sure Pete ever had a day quite this bad)."
1,false advertising,the telephone was clearly marketed with digital answering machine included which it did not haveupon delivery. My friend also ordered the identical item with the same issue. I used your descriptions of the individual items to determine which product would meet my needs and was extremely frustrated when the phone was not as described.
3,JAMES CLEVELAND?,"I'm a bit puzzled here. There is a bit of James Cleveland on here. But it's stuff I already have. Then there are performances of the choirs with him directing. If that's alright with you, I guess it's alright. But, I need more of James."
1,"most of the songs were not performed by rev. cleveland,","when you buy anyone's dvd's/cd's, you expect the majority of the songs to be performed by them not some choir that you never heard of so it is a great disappointment---- the bottom line is that if the dvd or cd has a well-known singer on the cover then the songs should be performed by them"
2,Not worth the money,"Most of the tracks on this album are pretty much unlistenable. the demos are practically unbearable. And the Back and Forth songs aren't much of anything really. I guess it's for the REALLY hard core fans, everyone else probably won't like it."
5,great show,For me Nick and Schmidt are two of the best sitcom characters to come along in a long long time.
5,Great Start,Great album sweitzer can really rock the drums and lyrics andvocals are great to. i cant wait to here the next album.
5,A Wonderful Childhood Memory,"As long as I live, I will never forget my Mother reading this book to me. I've bought this book for every child in my life...It's worth sharing."
2,Of Limited Appeal,"I like most travelogues, and I love McLean's fiction (Blackden, Bucket of Tongues, Bunker Man), so, even though I've never even heard of Western Swing music, I thought I might like McLean's account of his journey to Texas in 1995 in search of the remnants of Bob Wills and his Texas Playboys. After reading half the book, I'm forced to admit that I was wrong. While McLean's enthusiasm brims from every page, it's hard for the outsider to care about his descriptions of obscure artists and their tunes.And while McLean is an excellent writer of fiction, he is alas, only a workmanlike travel writer. He dutifully chronicles his trials and tribulations, but there's a certain zing missing-a lack of true insight perhaps. There is plenty in Texas to remark on, and he does, but having driven across the state several times myself, I never felt I was learning anything new. So, while I love his fiction, I'd have to recommend giving this a pass unless you're a fan of Western Swing."
1,A disappointing read,"Having previously read, and thoroughly enjoyed, a lot of books by this author - The Green Lion Trilogy, The Chronicles of Celydonn, etc - I was seriously looking forward to this one. Unfortunately this one is NOT in the league of her other novels, the plot is thin and unengaging, the characters are flat and rarely interesting, I just couldn't bring myself to care what happened to them at all. My best advice is this: if you are a fan of Teresa Edgerton's work, do yourself a favour, keep your good opinion intact and AVOID this one!"
5,So Nice I Ordered Twice!,"Item arrived very quickly and in excellent condition -- looked brand new and was packaged well so it wasn't banged up or anything. I used skinnier hangers and clothes pins to secure dresses and I fit something like 12 dresses, a suit, and 2 skirts in the first one I ordered! I ordered a second one because I really filled the first one up so much. There is a slit at the top for the hanger tops to go through of course. In the winter, I'll probably tape this to prevent moths or any other vermin from getting to my nicer clothes. The bags are really long. I fit several gowns inside with room to spare. That's easy enough to do of course. I won't hesitate to order again if I need one although I fit so much in... it won't be for awhile!"
1,Defective Zipper,I was happy with this until I went to retrieve a dress this past weekend. This was the first time that I tried to retrieve an item. Zipper came off and unable to open without destroying bag. I opened by separating zipper by hand and now have a bag that no longer closes.
2,CARPENTERS: LIVE IN LONDON...DISAPPOINTMENT,"Like the other reviewers...very disappointed in the quality of this DVD....the last song on the DVD looks like a second generation VHS copy. The overal quality is fair...but this disc is nothing to write home about. However, it's a Carpenters collection so I'm still glad to have it, regardless of the disappointing audio and video quality.I was surprised, though, that Richard had nothing to do with this release, as he seems to have a hand in everything that was and is released on the Carpenters.If you want to buy this, go ahead, it's still worth having, but don't expect a pristine copy or something like the DVDs that Richard has released in the past."
1,Awful,"What a disaster! How can Amazon sell this obvious bootleg. The quality and packaging is so poor, I can't believe the Carpenters management or Richard Carpenter would allow such a terrible product.The show was taped off Japanese television. There are channel graphics in the corner of the screen, and English subtitles. The audio is bad. The show is edited for commercials, which are missing. So, it flows very poorly. You'll see Karen get up from the behind the drums and take a microphone to front the band, only to have the next shot with her behind the drums, as if by magic. After the 30 minute concert, they tacked on a very poor copy of ""Superstar"". I looks like a 4th generation video tape. I can't tell you how disapointed I was in this product."
3,Mixed feelings,Disappointing quality is the worst part. But it was recorded 40 years ago and it is a recording of the Carpenters performing. There are and hopefully will be better releases.
1,Dangerous for all investors,I didn't actually buy this book but I read borrowed it from a friend who wanted to know what I thought of it.The book is very dangerous because it attempts to show how past results of a pretty obscure formula gave fantastic returns for the last 30 years. What it fails to mention is that none of the methods shown in the book have produced Dow beating results since they were published.One reason that the Motley Fool keeps coming up with new variations is that the old ones don't seem to work very well after they have been discovered.Anyone reading thinking about this book should skip it and take the other main piece of advice from the Motley Fool and invest in an index fund.
2,Sorry,"but I found this to be uninteresting, unmoving. Dull and dry characters. Lots of literary allusions if you are into that but little for the ""commoner"".Shoot the Lawyer Twice: A Rep and Melissa Pennyworth Mystery by Michael Bowen is an American version that might interest literature academics."
1,Disappointment,"In over five years of transactions with Amazon, I've not been this disappointed at all. I ordered the stainless steel product displayed, but I kept receiving the aluminum product. This happened three times though I returned the merchandise with my reason clearly explained. I guess it's the age of machines for if a human eye had read my reason, there was no way s/he could have sent me the aluminum expresso maker three times.On balance, this is just a small event in my overall relationship as a customer, which I can certainly overlook. However, Amazon should look into this matter because even for them, this business plan is not at all efficient. Amazon incurred six shipping charges and didn't even make the sale."
3,"Where's ""Goin' Out of My Head""?","Yeah, I've seen this movie several times and that version of Dr. John is not the one played in the movie. It's a completely different song, with the same song title. If you don't believe me, just pop in the DVD and see for yourself. Then you'll be like, ""Dude, this guy was right!"" and if you're a female, you'll be like, ""O.M.G.... that guy was right!"""
5,Old is New!,"The patterns in this book were old patterns and the author took the time to chart, rewrite and modernize them. The majority of them were patterns that I have never seen before!"
5,The Bible Part One,"I have an old copy of this that is falling apart at the seams, and it, along with my old 1984 copy of Vogue's Dictionary of Knitting Stitches, is my Bible. A MUST-OWN for anyone who wants to take their knitting beyond scarves. I take it with me everywhere--it's been to NY, Charleston, Mazatlan...and I get hours of inspiration and enjoyment knitting swatches, testing stitches, playing with combinations of cables. Not only do you get the stitches and instruction, you get the mechanics and explanations of how one stitch is related to another, particularly in the section on lace. I've learned more from this book than any other. Absolutely indespensible!"
1,"She's great, but she can't be heard above the band!","Three of us listened to the CD on my first-class, surround sound system, AND WE COULDN'T HEAR THE WORDS OF THE SONGS. Great singer, bad sound crew."
5,It plugged right in,"This pen worked exactly as the original equipment did, and added a little extra fun to the Leap Pad. Open the battery compartment, plug it in, route the wire and the kids were playing again."
1,BORING !,"this is a typical pop track whit no real substance to it the same again and again, a song you will get sick off"
4,GBA,"This is an older system, but still loads of fun. Respect the classics. Just needs stereo speakers and a back light."
4,Sounds like real Mahler to me.,"After reading all the earlier reviews by listeners, I felt compelled to add my thoughts to the list. My favorite Mahler X remains BBC's Wigglesworth Cooke II version live recording. Olson's present studio version becomes my favored non-live take. Olson's credentials are above reproach. He is the conductor for Colorado's annual Mahlerfest in Boulder. This recording struck me as a committed, very personal, and honest rendition. I would like to hear more of this conductors Mahler. I understand that his Mahlerfest live recordings are available via the festival's web page. I think that his work here deserves respect."
4,"Mac Raboy's Flash Gordon, volume 3","My review of Raboy's Flash Gordon vol 1 could mostly be applied as is to volume 3. Excellent stuff for not only science fiction comic strip fans, but probably science fiction fans in general. A little dated, perhaps (as you would expect), but beautifully smooth and polished draughtmanship, and stories that are still pretty decent. (Story lines that would seem old-hat if published as novels take on a new life and fascination when presented in a beautiful visual format -- the Star Wars movies are the prime example of this). The one complaint, again: should have been reprinted in their orignal color, rather than in black and white."
5,Flash! Gordon! still a great story in the 21st century,"Enjoying ""G"" rated book - has romance but no cuss words; has action but no blood; does have some 1930's male/female roles but Dale is in there fighting for/with her man; it is not in color but the drawings are excellent - the printed words is small and sometimes hard to read but I can understand what is going on without reading the words - worth the price - planing to get the rest of the books"
4,A Joyful Read,I don't know why people dislike this book so much. I did kind of want the story of Kathy and Mike to continue but I found myself enjoying this well told story of their adopted daughter Kathy. The idea of taking up the story through a new Kathy's eyes worked well for me. I became involved in her story immediately. The other characters that populate the book are well-developed. The descriptions that accompany Kathy's journey are just as vivid as those in the original book. 4 Stars for me!
3,A good book for a beginner - but nowhere near enough detail,"This book is probably a good start for anyone who has never travelled to Latin America. It does provide some good background info (weather statistics, cultural info, major festival times, etc) on how to plan a rough outline for a trip. It even has sections on travel themes (e.g. where to go whitewater rafting, where to go hiking, where the good beaches are, etc.) The problem is that the information is way too general and brief. For example, in this 300 page book there are only 1-2 pages covering the highlights of each country, and only a half page that describes possible itineraries in each country. Detailed trip planning will require more than this book, so you might as well start with a more complete book."
1,They were too narrow..,"They were too narrow, and by the time my mom put them on, i tossed the box and paperwork away.. and so i couldnt return them :("
1,Download not complete,"I chose this version of The Art of War because of the completeness of it. However the Kindle does not reference or index the first 37%, 2200 locations, of the document. The only way to access this area is to jump to a location or page back. If you go to the beginning of the book it is jibberish, unreadable characters. And don't try to jump to location 1 or the Kindle will go into vapor lock!"
5,Super Cute Bear,"Bear is soft, cute and white. My daughter collects these little steiff suitcase bears and is thrilled with this one. For anyone like me who has dogs - who steal and carry off little toys like this .... in my experience they do wash and are pretty robust.Shipping was fast, service super efficient. A pleasure to deal with this seller."
4,Yummy!,"This just happens to be my favourite BFTE (Before Fumbling Towards Ecstasy) song from Sarah. So of course I'm going to tell you I loved it. But the real gem on this single is the violin mix of Shelter - which is luscious. It will make you want to tap dance barefoot on a cloud made of marshmallows. The only reason this doesn't get 5 stars is because it's only two songs, and I'm much happier if they'd replace the edited version of a song with a completely different track altogether. If you like Sarah, buy it - it's a must have in a Sarah collection."
3,"Not really a history, more of a travel log","This book is beautifully written, but is deceptive in its title. It is not a history of the earth, but rather a travel log of various places that the author has visited with some science interjected at various places."
4,Shoe storage,"I purchased this and used it for smaller shoes. It works as advertised, not heavy duty, but sufficient for saving space."
4,Not quite as wide as advertised,"The product appears to be well constructed, but the shelf is 7.5"" wide rather than 8"" (8"" includes outside stitching) and is a tight fit for larger men's shoes (mine is size 11). A bit disappointed, but did not see any models with wider shelf capacity."
2,"Funny 1/2way Thru, Then Turns Vicious","Not being a particular fan of transsexuals, I still found this book to be insulting to them. Every character in this book is despicable, the story goes nowhere, and even though it was funny in many parts, it was a mean-spirited kind of humor."
1,Mississippi Mud is a laughable novel!,"I live very close to Biloxi and since I had followed this story in the newspaper, I wanted to read the novel for myself. I was extremely disappointed in the author's work. Most shocking to me was that the author is a pulitzer prize winner, yet a lot of the information in the book was obviously false. This book is simply creative writing, and I do not see why anyone interested in true crime would bother to order this one."
4,True crime that reads like fiction!,"I agree completely with ""a reader from NJ""--the Sherrys apparently were not nice people, and they crossed the wrong people time after time after time with no thought of consequences. Mr. Humes is an excellent writer, and he certainly researched this book well.The Kirksey Nix blackmail caper was borrowed by John Grisham in ""The Brethren""!"
1,Just buy an Ipod Nano for now.,"This item seems nice, until you read that it has... 512 megs of space.What movies/books are you going to put on this? And after you put something like that on it, what space will you have left for music?I'm not an Ipod junkie, but this is worthless. For $40 more, you get 1.5 gigs more. I think that is well worth it."
4,My Favorite Volume so far,I've always loved the Ed vs Greed fight in the series (though their battle in the first series will be my favorite version) But getting to read it in the manga was still a great experience. Not to mention all the extras and side stories that Arakawa adds at the end always leaves me in stitches.
4,"illustrations are by Ivor Wood, not Peggy Fortnum","The stories in this book are, as usual for a Paddington book, entertaining. All feature the British television show Blue Peter in one way or another. My only complaint is that the Amazon listing for the paperback version (ISBN 0618250719) says the illustrations are by Peggy Fortnum (whose drawings I prefer), but it turns out they're actually by Ivor Wood. My two-year-old daughter loves the book no matter, though."
5,Wonderful Regency!,"Kathryn Caskie's debut is beautifully written, with characters you care about immediately and plot twists that surprise and delight. She has a deft way with description that expands the story world without distracting from the antics of her characters. Magnus, the hero, is wonderful and Eliza is everything a heroine should be - smart, talented, a little unconventional, and willing to sacrifice everything for her family and the man she loves.I'm looking forward to reading Kathryn's next books!"
3,I would pass...,Rules of Engagement by Kathryn Caskie is the standard on again off again historical romance novel. It has a few humorous moments but over all a quick easy read.
2,Couldn't finish it,"All the reviews for this were so enthusiastic I thought i'd give it a shot. But I just don't get it. I'm confused: Did I actually read the same book that all of the other reviewers read? I just couldn't finish Rules of Engagement. I didn't really care about any of the characters, and the humor seemed very forced. It wasn't true wit, it was more of the ""falling-down"" variety -- very slapstick. The dialogue was kind of wooden. I've seen comparisons to Julia Quinn, and they don't apply at all. JQ writes characters with heart, and the humor stems from the characters themselves. I did read the excerpt in the back of this book of Caskie's next book, and it looks promising. I feel a little duped by these reviews, but I might check out Caskie's next book. But i'll stand in the store and read quite a few pages before i buy it, that's for sure."
1,What A Bomb.,"Id save my money with the economy being what it is.What a waste of great talent,Howard Duff,Stephen MCNally,Anne Jeffreys,Oscar Beregi,etcTake my word for it,they made better movies."
2,Yawn,"Hardly erotic, no character development, and pretty timid sex. Not what I would call an erotic masterpiece, or even good entertainment."
3,Biodiesel,"Good history on biodiesel development, less on technical.It gives a good chapter on the development/adoption of biodiesel around the world."
4,good tips; good sized bag,"I am just trying to get into this cake decorating thing and I have been looking for the larger tips. This set had 2 of the styles I wanted AND a reusable bag to boot. I decided to get another set so I could do 2 frosting colors/flavors at once. I have tried out both tips and will need more practice, but washing out the bags was a bit of an ordeal. The bags easily hold a can of premade frosting with space to spare."
4,Simple and good pastry bag,I bought this for a pastry class I took. This bag and tips are simple and get the job done. I think if you need something with a lot of different tips or are going to be decorating elaborate cakes then this might not be the set for you. However if you just need simple piping equipment then this is probably a perfect buy. I really liked it because it came with the piping bag and the price is relatively cheap. I actually went to a local kitchen type store and they were selling just the tips for about $2-4. So I thought I minus well spend the extra money and get a bag also and I super glad I did because now I don't need to borrow other peoples bag just to use the tips.
4,A cake decorator I am not,"I enjoy baking and decorating cakes, but my decoration skills could use some work. That is one of the reasons I purchased theAteco Extra Wide Pastry Decorating Tip, Set of 3. Of course without some skill your results won't be fantastic, but with a little practice they'll get better. My most recent attempt was on a cake for my daughter. I stuck with the star tip and although not fancy, my results were better than what she's used to. Because these are wide tips they're great for borders and also for filling things like cream puffs and cannoli. If still available it's worth purchasing using Amazons 4-for-3 Promo and you'll save a few bucks.*Just added a customer image of cupcakes I made this last weekend using the star tip."
2,Over the top muzak,"Good film work, bad informational, not a film for naturalists other than the cinematography, ridiculous music, just ridiculous and over the top, I put it on mute several times just to enjoy the scenery."
3,Pushes evolution constantly.,"In just about every segment, the commentary includes the phrase ""million(s) of years."" Probably 20 times in the first episode. Really. Why do we need to hear the theory presented as fact throughout the episode like this. Even if you do believe in evolution, it would have to be annoying. I've seen gobs of nature shows and have never had it this bad. Other than that, the show was great."
3,missing 1 disc,"liked the movies that's why I bought them for my library.the package was missing 1 movie disc so a price change was made.I like buying movie packages because they are a better value andmost times contain the popular movies of the actor, or style of thepackage.."
5,Mind Meld: Secrets Behind the Voyage of a Lifetime,"This candid interview between William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy is a necessity for all star trek fans! In this one-on-one documentary, the two legends reveal the struggles and adventures they have experienced as a result of their work on Star Trek. The two share their demons and hardships in this beatifully shot production. The film takes place in Nimoy's home, which is adorned with rare personal photographs and star trek memorabilia - WOW! Most of all they reveal their incredible bond and the friendship that they have shared over the years."
3,It was O.K.,It wasn't as scary as other Goosebumps books. My sister read itand she didn't have any trouble falling asleep. For some other Goosebumps books she had nightmares.
3,An o.k. book.,"It was Holloween when Drew and Walker had came up with a plan for reveange .But something had went wrong , the Jack -o- lanterns had got stuck on there heads it was to small. Then the little heads starting to make noise."
1,Boring!,Drew and her Walker meet two pumpkin costumes. And the creatures says TRICK OR TREAT FOREVER. It was so boring. Do not waste your money just to buy this.
1,The stand wobbles!,"I bought this because of the good reviews, but discovered that the machining job was terrible, the plate wobbled. It looked like the pin was not centered when it was turned on a lathe. I returned it and bought the same one thinking that maybe it was just the one that I received that was messed up, no, this one was worse. Now I'm returning it again and buying something different."
2,Hmm...,"I am interested to see if its good or not. Somehow the kids in the movie are supposedly related to the original cast. They make note in the movie that both Julie and Ray have been killed, and Sony originally wanted to release it in theaters but later decided to keep it as a STV release!"
4,I'm Doomed! :-D,"Disclaimer: I know one of the authors.I knew this book wasn't written for me because I know what ""real-time"" and ""methodology"" mean -- they are highlighted and explained in the book -- but I had never heard of ""LOB executive"" which is not explained in the book.The book is a management take on SOA -- why your business can benefit and how the concepts of SOA relate to typical enterprise business practices. The book is quite readable -- the concepts are clear and well-reasoned. Personally, I wanted more discussion of actual implementation details, but, like I said, this book wasn't written for me. XML and SOAP are never mentioned, however, there are two Henny Youngman jokes and Charlie Chaplin is cited. These guys know their audience!"
2,yeah....no,"I am Australian, this book is so.....WRONG!....we for one are not lonely and yeah...the list goes on, if you are buying this book for ""learning"" purposes, you are learning the WRONG things, if you want to hear a lot of fake things about Australia go for it, me as an Australian did NOT appreciate this book...thank you"
5,comprehensive as always,"I'm a big fan of LP books, and I've tried some of their competitors and still think LP is the best. This was advertised as being ""used"" but I can't see why, which made it a real bargain."
1,"I got a old Phillips in the right box, will be the last buy from you!",I got an old Phillips DVD in a new Toshiba SD-3960 DVD Player box. What a scam! I didnt even have the remote included.
1,rubbish,"Do not buy this product, every AVI file I play , the film grinds to a halt towards the end. Very frustrating. this is going in the bin."
2,Windows Vista Solutions - What Solutions?,Don't waste your money. Information is very out of date with all the changes to Vista since the release. Basically a Vista for Dummies type book that does not really delve into why Vista is so quirky and how to fix it (if it can be fixed).
3,This could be better,I rarely write reviews but I am a big fan of the true crime genre.This book started off pretty well; it was interesting.LITERALLY AT 50% the book was all the trial.I couldn't stand that and I didn't finish the book- I already knew what happened I just wanted to get to know the characters better. There wasn't too much of that.
1,So Disappointed,"Hey, Mr. Kearney, let me tell you what I (and alot of other folks) look for in true crime books: DON'T JUST TALK ABOUT THE TRIAL, GIVE US SOME BACKGROUND INFO ON THE PEOPLE INVOLVED!!!!! PLEASE!This book barely had any background info on anybody involved in this book. Instead it went over the night of Devon's murder, and other than a page or two hear and there, straight to the trial. I disagree with the poster who thought the trial was probably 40% covered, instead I'd place it at about 75%, maybe more.And if that wasn't bad enough, it seemed like in the trial phase certain things were said over and over again.If you're into a blow by blow account of trials you'd enjoy this book. As for me, I was so stoked to get this book, okay with the first part, started getting a little unhappy towards the middle, and finally I just gave up. I couldn't even finish it.I don't think I'll ever buy another one of his books."
1,"My dear, Oh my poor child ....* eye roll*","really boring book thank goodness I got it for free. This book could have been exciting and a great read but it wasn't. So we are left with a young lady and old gentlemen who has decided he needed some excitement in his life and he decided to rescue his father's old buddy's last heir. He does seem pretty clever but he doesn't really stink of I am Hero make room for me and are young lady the heroine doesn't quite seem to be all there. My guess is that all the tedious descriptions are meant to drag us in and keep us but it doesn't, it just makes my eyes wander."
5,Great historical from 18th Century,"year is 1791 Europe. An English nobel is confronted with odd taskof saving Marie Antoinette and Leonie De Conyers from guillotine.Step out of Roberts Gellis usual period. But very well worth thetrip. She brings you there, the struggles of people duringgovernmental outrage and growth. Intense characters, dynamicstory movement, excellent historical romance."
2,History lesson or romance novel?,"While I commend the author for creating a rich historical backdrop, it is just too much and detracts from the story. I am now about 70% of the way through the story according to my kindle, and fighting to get through it. I am skimming through the excessive descriptions. Alright already - get the girl back to England and live happily ever after (I hope)! I am not one to quibble over a missing comma here and there, but this book requires some serious editing. 'He rode in the carnage' (carriage)? 'She singed' (sighed)? The story has potential if the author would get a good editor, rework the plot and correct all the typographical errors."
3,Not What I Expected,We purchased this toy for my 2 1/2 year old son as a replacement to a Melissa and Doug ABC Train Puzzle that we borrowed from a friend. I was disappointed- the pictures while artsy are not clear pictures for a toddler. He needs constant help with the puzzle which can be frustrating for him. The pieces are thin and might be better for an older child.
2,Not for me.,"I've heard SO MANY great things about this product from close to 50 or so people. People say if you have acne or problem skin to us this and it'll help clear everything up. Sadly I didn't get those results. It caused me to break out. I was hoping this would help my skin but it didn't. I've also heard from a number of ladies with mature skin that this stuff is wonderful! I'm sure most people would get great results, just not me."
2,i am breaking out with this product plz help !,"i will not deny that i don't have acne ...but after using this product for more than a week , it makes my skin breakout and is getting worse ! i read some reviews that sometimes it will make u breakout , should i keep using it till i see results??"
2,No results for meI,"I tried this after seeing the reviews on the site. I have used this product once daily for well over a month along with the AH cleanser and spf lotion. The other products are nice. The souffle said stinging would be a normal side effect for the first few weeks, so I stuck with it. To this day, the stinging is still intense and I have seen no positive change in my skin. I was hoping that it would alleviate my acne/scars, but I'm breaking out worse than ever. If the stinging or acne does not calm soon, it looks like I'll have to move on to the next product. The Neutrogena Acne system looks promising."
1,"Scratchy, static sounds on Disc 2 !","Although I have enjoyed disc 1 and disc 3, the disc 2 has several minutes of loud scratchy/static sounds on multiple tracks. This occurred on the original shipment I received from Amazon, and they kindly sent me a replacement disc.......and would you believe the exact same thing occurs on the replacement set!! On disc 2, in virtually the exact same spots. I wonder if Calliope Records in France has received complaints?! Dissapointing. My bad rating is not for Mozart or Talich Quartet, it is for Calliope records"
1,Not really useful,"This is an OK book if you have zero knowledge of CheckPoint products. If you're actively admin'ing an NG FW-1, please spend your money on a better books, as you'll end up being frustrated by the seemingly randomness of this book.As an example, topics about licensing are non-existant. Those who admin FW-1 know the nightmare of CheckPoint licensing, which in reality could be discussed in an entire chapter of it's own."
3,Occasional problems,"All was well until about the third month of owning it. It now gets stuck in start up mode every so often. I have to take the cover off and hit the reset button. Sometimes that doesn't work and it needs to be done several times. Read more reviews and decide for yourself.All in all it's not a bad player. Simple, easy to use."
3,Good value,"Let me say upfront that Alta Vista is my #1 search engine, and part of the reason I purchased this book was to become a better searcher. But the real reason was to optimize the chances of my web site getting Alta Vista hits. The book helped me on both counts--especially pointing out the need for Meta tags in the HTML header (but you won't find meta tags in the index). The development of Alta Vista by Digital makes for good reading, as well as the appendices on search word frequencies. The low point of the book is Ch. 6--106 pages of search examples that are not very interesting. I wish the book had been written with a bit more technical detail and much less filler. Given the book's low price, I would still rate it a good value"
3,Design has already faded,The Guy Harvey logo has already faded almost completely off after 3 washings. The shirt itself has also faded drastically. I almost don't think this is a true Guy Harvey but a knock-off.
1,The higher nonsense,"Gosse's motto apparently was ""Don't confuse me with the facts, my mind is made up."" Although he was a scientist and therefore should have known better, he was also a member of a small, fanatical millenarian cult with a literal belief in Genesis, which posits that the world was created in a flash in 4004 BC. Since all of the scientific data pointed in the other direction, with the strong implication that Genesis is simply a Jewish creation myth which has no more validity than a Navaho creation myth, for example, Gosse tried to hold on to his cult beliefs by dreaming up a totally preposterous rationalization in which God is seen as a hoaxster and the universe as a hoax. This obviously doesn't put God in a good light, and many Christians have rejected Gosse along with the usual atheists. One unusual result of Gosse's theory was a theory called Last Thursdayism, which posits that everything was created last Thursday, but God made it look older."
3,Room of Marvels - fact or ficton?,I enjoyed the book but was a little disappointed with the ending. The story line was entertaining but I guess not my preferred genre. I gravitate to suspense/thriller. Nothing about this book answered the mail as far as that goes. Easy read.
5,Wonderful book,This is a wonderful read for those who have lost someone close to them. It deals with real emotions that come along with grief and addresses many false narratives in a creative fashion.
1,need more info,"How can I know if I would order this if the songs are not listedand also who performed each song,namely Big Noise from Winnetka?I am trying to find a copy of the ORIGINAL recording of ""Big Noise from Winnetka"" performed by the actual artists who wrote or originally performed it--Ray Bauduc,Haggart. Many CD'S list them but it is not actually they who are performing it. It may be Bob Crosby and some of his later band members? I would appreciate this info ASAP; not only on this CD,but also on all Bob Crosby reviews. THANKS!"
3,Not working.,"This is soothing compared to the other products I have tried but it is not as effective.I ordered two and one was leaking, but fortunately they were packed in a plastic bag. I called the seller and they were great. They are going to send a replacement. Guess I will use it for the horse as it is not what I need for the cats. The viscosity will probably repel flies from the horses ears even if it does not kill them."
3,Performer Ear Mite Killer,The cream formula made it very easy to use and was comfortable for the cat. It seems to help kill the ear mites but it's going to have to be used several times to kill all of them.
4,"Good, bad and the indifferent","I kind of concur with the other reviews here in terms of not really be that cohesive an album. However, the tracks that are good (4 or 5 of them) are VERY good - hence a weighted average 4 stars. The song 'Perk' is my favourite."
5,One of the Best Scholastic Collections!,"This is one of the best Scholastic Collections. Giggle, Giggle, Quack is a great new classic book about a farmer and his farm animals. Make Way for Ducklings and other Robert McCloskey stories are wonderful stories to enjoy forever and Tikki Tikki Tembo is a great story too. The other stories contained on the DVDs are of the same quality if less known. I highly recommend this collection."
2,"Get Voyetra ""Teach Me Piano""","I already owned the Voyetra teach me piano and went ahead and bought the Alfred version because it looked more up to date and slicker looking. Well, be that as it may, it's mostly quicktime videos with a guy giving you general lessons.The MIDI implentation is virtually nill compared to Voyetra (sp?). I didn't realize how good Voyetra ""Teach Me Piano"" was until I tried this product. I am going to try and bring it back to Borders...It's that bad...Don't get it.."
5,Wonderful Puzzles,These puzzles are fantastic. I bought my neice two for her birthday and she loves them. The best feature: the little suitcase-style box which makes it an easily transportable toy. Great overall quality.
2,For home bars only!!,"This book may have a lot of drinks, lots of recipes and some funny anecdotes...but as a professional bartender it has some serious flaws - it is in no way a complete bar guide - in fact it misses a few popular cocktails that I serve regularly - and these are not local specials but well known age old drinks!! Also it is paperback and doesnt sit well on the bar - I like a book that is gonna last and that is easy to work with. If you need to know the definition of a ""barspoon"" then this books has the answer - if you want to know how to make a Caesar then try Seagrams Bartending Guide!!"
5,"the best book on the market today,for novis &pro bartenders","being a bartender at a casino on the mississippi gulf coast,we sometimes have to knock out twenty on up drink,orders in minutes. the ultimate A-to-Z bar guide is by far the most user friendly bible on the market today ! i've recomended it to everyone i know ,that wants to be the best ."
4,Everything you need to know about drinks...,"If you are looking for a recipe book for alcoholic drinks, this is definately the book for you! This book would be great for bartenders to have as a reference or anyone who just wants to know more about what is in drinks and how to make them. You need not have any experiece with mixing drinks to be able to follow the directions, and the best feature is the indices that allow you to quickly and easily look up the drinks you want to find."
2,Sophisticated Drek,"There is a certain philosophy that runs through all the songs on this disc which I will call Nihilistic Hedonism. The points are these: The universe is chaotic with no lasting meaning or ultimate purpose. Pain is prevalent, primarily because of the unfulfilled expectations natural to such a chaotic universe. Most of the unfulfilled expectations have to do with relationships. Pain is avoided by minimizing expectations. Pleasure should be pursued since it is the only, albeit temporary, escape. It is because of this undertone that I refer to this as 'drek'. On the positive, the lyrics are intelligent, the voice is haunting, and on the whole I cannot think of a way that this could have been more beautifully done. Very well packaged, but drek nonetheless."
2,Avoid if possible !,We did as instructed but no matter what the grass won't grow on the top and the back. We just threw it away as its a lot sensitive to light and cold.
3,Reply to comment above,"C.R.Bates above says that Mitamura ""repeats [George] Carter Stent's assertion that eunuchs stink and `can be detected by smell 300 metres away.' More pure biased twaddle.""Never having been to China nor studied the place, I cannot comment on the accuracy of George's paper to the Royal Asiatic Society. However, my reading of the paper is that George is saying Chinese people in his time ""speak of them as `stinking eunuchs', and aver that they can smell a eunuch for half-a-li."" In other words he does not state this as a fact, but rather reports it without comment as something said by others."
3,They offered Gromets... they lied!,"The emblem is very nice, but... they offered the emblem including 2 gromets... there were NO GROMETS in the package.I had to paste the emblem with silicone to the hood."
3,nice emblem,"it gets 3 stars instead of 5 bc of false advertising (i hate liars). The one in the picture has a silver colored METAL looking back. The one that came off of my 1991 BMW was metal, heavy and just like the one in the picture. The one that was actually shipped to me was plastic and black on the back, although it looks like the original, it does not feel like it. I gambled purchasing from this new source, the last emblem I purchased was from bavauto.com and it was the exact replacement, but it was considerably more expensive."
4,Early Everlys,"Don and Phil were huge stars in the late 50s and their influence on subsequent music was great. But many people think their best work came later. My personal all-time favorite is Bowling Green, released in 1967. This particular compilation covers the period 1957 to 1962, when they were at the peak of their popularity. It includes their biggest hits from that time. Whether it is their best work or not, it is what they will be remembered for. It is great to have the original recordings, so that you can hear them just as were. The price is good too, so if you want to know what else the Teddy Boys and Bobby Soxers were listening to besides Elvis, this is the album for you."
4,relief,"Transforming Trauma: EMDR: The Revolutionary New Therapy for Freeing the Mind, Clearing the Body, and Opening the HeartI was able to gain an understanding of EMDR with easy to understand, not too hard or simple language.This book is a quick read with all of the information I need."
2,AI can be very difficult!,"This game looks ok and would have been fun to play if not for the frustrating AI. Even at the amateur level, the computer opponent never hits an ""out"". You need alot of frustrating tries and practice to unlock extras. Increasing your skills is very limited to a few drills (some you have to unlock by winning in other modes) which makes it very hard to advance. Can get very repetitive soon if you find it hard to advance in the game. A couple of things that will annoy you in this game: Canadian doubles (you vs 2 opponents) and blocker. The advanced drill events are also too difficult.The good thing about this game is that you can play online. You can setup a match where both players have the same skill level."
5,It works!!!,We have a two car garage with only one remote. Now we have two. Easy to program and the price was good. Just make sure it's compatible with your unit before purchasing.
2,This product is not totally a good quality,"I've bought two of this remotes already, because they work for a while and then, they stop working, but i guess i have to go back to get one, i have to open my garage."
4,Emotive Pop Covers,"I have always liked Vonda Shepard's voice since I first heard it during the run of Ally McBeal, and consequently have purchased all of her CD's at least once. If you recognise the song titles you should know if you will at least like this CD, for while Ms. Shepard is not and amazing vocalist, she manages to create warm renditions of each song with emotive tones and wonderful phrasing. This CD includes one of my favorite renditions of Roy Orbison's ""Crying"" as well as the wonderful ""Don't Break My Heart Slow"" which has been one of my favorite pop songs since I first heard it on the show.While I might have never bought this album had I never seen the show, the daydream of having Vonda Shepard as the club cover artist downstairs at work, hooked me into buying and then loving this album in just a few listens."
2,disappointed,"The alarm and light work as advertised, however I have already lost 2 of the 3 alarms I bought because the chain is extremely cheap and breaks at the slightest pull."
2,Useful but lacking,Good information but very general and lacks any useful detail. One can get a lot of this information on line or from the locals.
5,I like Automoblox,This toy is colorful and designed well with good fit and finish. Parts can be swapped with other Automoblox cars.
4,Good car !,"Great toy for younger kids. It helps the kids to think about the pieces how to put them back together, shapes putting in the right holes..... Durable !"
5,Al Menconi relates to Parents,When I first read the book I thought it would be just another book about how bad music is for kids but Al talks about the positive aspects of music and a persons outlook as well as the negative. If a parent only reads one book about talking to thier kids about music then this is the one.
2,"From Canada, smuggled in?","This product was old, and was from canada...the blades worked fine, but I am still wondering why it wasnt labeled as coming from canada instead of made for the american markey.....fast delivery and all, but i woner if taxes were paid to bringq them in to this country"
3,Quick and easy.,Best deal on refills I could find. But I still thing refill blades are more expensive than they need to be. I may start using disposables ones to see if they are more affordable than refilling ones.
5,Razor Blades,"The products were received in good condition, well packaged and shipped in a timely manner. I have used these razor blades for years and like them. They have been replaced in the manufacturers line by newer modelsat retail outlets, which leaves Amazon one of the only current sources."
1,"Great Price, Shame about the shipping",I don't mind paying shipping when the price is good but to charge individual item shipping when placing a multiple item order is just not on.Gillette blades don't exactly weigh much so how does the vendor (or Amazon) justify charging $2.45 shipping per item when I try to order three of the same item at the same time. $7.35 shipping for three packs of ten blades is just a profiteering rip-off. I won't bother... not because the blades aren't a good deal... just out of principle.
3,"Good read, but very short in volume","The story line is good, but the book is very short in volume. It would have been better to have included it with one of the authors other short stories to make a better value. The published price for the book was excessive, but the Amazon price was very good."
3,Ok book,Liked the historical photos and history of West Hollywood but was less interested in the social issues covered within the book.
2,did'nt read between the lines,"made the mistake of thinking theses were songs by original artists , only to find out they are orchestral recordings as in no singing, anyway, i kept it because of the low price, and that made it a little more tolerable,"
1,PHR/SPHR Professional in Human Resources Certification Study Guide by Anne Bogardus,"For many years, I have coordinated a study group for human resource individuals taking the PHR/SPHR certification test.I would not recommend this book. There are statements and questions in the text that do not go into enough depth to be able to study from this book and pass the certification exam.One example can be found on page 350, question 8, ""Which of the following injuries or illnesses is considered work-related?"" Under OSHA you have ""reportable"" and ""recordable"" accidents. The wording in the question is not complete.Another example is ""disparate impact"". The term is defined with two lines of text within the book, however, no examples or details are given on how to determine if there was disparate impact.I have heard from other certified individuals in our local area who purchased this book and will not use it as a source of study to pass the PHR/SPHR certification exam."
1,Nothing like I expected!,When I would write in English and translate to Italian It would add words or leave out words and change the meaning of what I intended to say. My computer has windows Vista. I don't know if that could be the proplem or not. But if it is I should have been told before I bought it.
3,Wild Wheels DVD was awesome!,"I had seen the Wild Wheels video at an artcar event in Arkansas last year but wanted the DVD too. There is a lot more here & the addition of The Directors Cut and Extras added a lot. The new music was fun to listen to & the quality was excellent. My favorite was the Button Man from North Carolina. A super DVD set & I recommend it to all. (My review should show 5 stars)Dave MajorBenton,Kansas"
2,Angkor Wat- a brief glimpse,"This is a very general overview of Angkor Wat, only goes for 9 mins and is really just a tourist promo. Not a lot of relevant information about the art work or architecture; the visuals are good but unless you are compelled to collect everything about Cambodia, like me, it's not worth it."
2,ATROCIOUS SOUND ENGINEERING,"TERRIBLE QUALITY OF SOUND... no bottoms, no depth, reverb for the voices practically non existent, extremely dry, as if the whole thing had been recorded in a room smaller than the palm of my hand, almost sounds mono and also some voices appear to have higher sound level (volume) than others... LOVE the singers (the reason why I bought this version), the conductor, the orchestra, etc... BUT: THE SOUND TECHNICIANS DESTROYED THIS RECORDING... INCREDIBLE! LISTENING TO THIS RECORDING IS TORTURE! WHAT A SHAME, REALLY!"
5,Classic and as enjoyable as ever.,Well mastered. Good quality recording. I was fortunate to get this on a $1.99 Gold Box deal. This music will live forever!
5,Simon and Garfunkel,I love these guys. Their voices are magic together. It is very nostalgic to hear them again. And this album is absolutely beautiful to hear.
4,Elm creek quilt series are great reads for quilters!,"I enjoyed the book, not as much as the first on in the series but it did keep my attention, so much so that I couldn't put it down and stayed up all night reading it. I love stories about quilts and quilters - I'm an avid quilter myself. The Elm creek quilt series are well written and in- volve you in the lives of a group of people that you can identify with. Great fun - I would recommend it highly."
2,GREAT TOPIC but to repative,I have read five of the Elm Creek novels and enjoyed all for different reasons. This one I can't say was that great. The author kept repeating the facts over again with each character and it began to get very boring. I wanted to skip sections and move on. I would have prefered more quilting tips and information regarding quilts and less scandals.
2,The grassy parts are brown!,"I had the exact same problem as a previous poster--the grassy parts that are green in the online photo of this rug are BROWN!!! It looks like dead grass--not a pretty site. The local children's museum has the same rug, but the grass is actually green. Not sure if Amazon has a bad batch. I returned the rug, and I am considering ordering directly from the company..."
5,Great Supplemental Commentary,"I have a lot of written commentaries but this commentary fills a big hole. First, it is visual which makes the subject come alive other than in your imagination. Second, it is filled with a lot of short, incisive facts that enhance the more detailed, word-driven commentaries. I can honestly say I learn something each time I refer to it. It has made my study of the New Testament much richer and much more fun."
5,It takes you on a magical journey.,"This is a wondeful C.D, the album version is the best having many foreign sounds in it. The others are just a s good, bur are a bit long, but it's still great."
3,Trance Track.,"A, Duende (Bleak Desolation Mix). AA, Duende (Bleak Desolation Dub). B, Duende (Spiritual Collapse MIx). BB, Duende (Album Mix).Something to play early on or on the way down. Nice."
3,It's Okay.,"An okay concealer. Not the best, but also not the worst. It could've concealed a lot better."
3,Exagerated and not exact truth regarding Jesus!,"I thought this would be good for children to view, but will not show it as I believe there are a number of inaccurate pieces of information included and do not wish to instill untruth to the children in our church!Sandy"
2,Who checked this,While overall usefull I found many errors in the test answers and had to check each answer myself. Not what I paid for.
1,Clark Kent - not so good,"The costume is cheaply made. The muscle ""shirt"" is only a frontal with it tying in the back, so the chance of it riding up and being bulky is highly likely. And the ""jacket"" is less than t-shirt material quality. I didn't have high expectations when I ordered it, but what I got was not at all what I expected. I ended up keeping it though because the shipping to return wasn't worth my time - catch 22.I don't mean this to be a ding to the vendor, as they were prompt. But the actual merchandise leaves a lot to be desired for any Superman wanna-bes."
3,This is an alright book,"Curious George always get in trouble. This time he gets in trouble in the fire station. I think Personally that this book is a good book, for little kids like me so, I that is why I rated this book a 3."
3,Lady in Waiting,I did not find this book as good as her previous ones. It went quite slowly and sometimes struck me a silly.
4,"Good, short, conditioning workout.","I am glad this DVD is not a kickboxing aerobic workout.That being said, this DVD may not help you workout to the point where you will break a sweat.But, what it will do is help you develop overall, coordination, GPP (general physical preparedness) and provide a means to have a great short workout, when you are crunched on time.This DVD will get you moving. People with neck injuries I would say to skip the neck exercises and substitute with something else, shoulder shrugs, arm swings, etc.Tiffany and Max Chen are good instructors, the set is pleasant and music is very much in the background.I plan to add this as an extra work out on my recovery days, when I do not feel like going full force, but want to still move around."
2,Not enough flow,"I love boxing/martial arts-based workouts, and really want to like this one, but I find it feels too fragmented."
1,too much information; absolutely no analysis,"the author clearly grabbed everything he could find from the Internet and jammed it into a book. typos abound, there's no rhyme or reason or overarching goal, and much of what's included is simplistic drivel or out-of-date data. a real disappointment."
2,Am I the only one who missed the point of the book?,"Would have been nice to know this was a collection of short, unrelated stories .. there is nothing to indicate as such on the book cover and some of the main storylines seem to imply they might run together .. i kept reading back and forth, wondering how i was missing the point, wondering if all would come together at the end .. it didn't .. so, i went online to read the review and saw it was a collection of 12 stories .. i might go back and read one or two with that knowledge, but, would have preferred to know upfront as i prefer novels .. i had read Out of the Picture and bought this book on her name alone, not a bad read, just not that worthwhile"
1,Poorly made merchandise,"This 1st Confederate flag is poorly printed. The corners of the blue field are not square and thus two sides of the blue area are not parallel the edges of the flag. The stars are also leaning on a slant and thus the flag does not display well. Shoddy merchandise, can not recommend."
2,Very BAD!!,"Freddy and his friend Cara are tough. When Freddy and Cara were fighting in Freddy's basemen, Cara pushed Freddy into an old cabinet thayt fell revealing a secret door. They opended the secret door and walked into a tunnel. At the end of the tunnel was another door. They opened the second door and walked in. Behind the door was a room with a coffin. They opend the coffin. All that was in it was a bottle of Vampire Breath. Freddy droped it and the cork poped off. When they were about to leave an old man apered. They thought he was dead when he got up and said ""I'm thirsty, so very thirsty.""Boring, stupid and not scary at all. BAD BOOK DON""T READ IT!!!!--Scottie Schaeffer age ten"
4,Great introduction to using oils,"This book gives a hobbyist a better idea of how to use oil paints: how to blend colors and highlight. I liked the fact that the author actually told you what colors to blend to make field grey for example; what colors to add to make the highlights etc. I wish he would have spent some time on the consistency and texture that the oils need to be. While this is a short book, I learned a lot from it. In my opinion, it taught me how to use oils more effectively then some of the more popular books, which just tell you to use oil paints, but never actually teach you how. I recommend this book to anyone who is a novice to medium ability."
3,"Pretty, leaky","The feeder was packaged well and arrived undamaged, and it looks like a lovely gem hanging in the tree. However, it leaks terribly and was empty within a week of hanging (hummingbirds have not yet arrived). Not bad for the price, and sugar water is inexpensive enough to make so I'd still recommend it. Kinda."
4,Good Halloween Music,"Drew's Famous Halloween Costume Party Music is forty-five minutes and sixteen seconds long and was released on June 6, 2006. The reason it four and not five stars is, the songs on it are not original recordings done by the original artist. A good example is Great Balls of Fire. I don't know who is singing it, but I can tell you it is not Jerry Lee Lewis. Otherwise this is great to have at any Halloween party. Also included are six bonus tracks of Halloween spooky sounds. Drew's Famous Halloween Costume Party Music gets a B-.1. Little Shop of Horrors2. Addams Family Theme3. Monster Mash4. Elvira5. Devil with the Blue Dress6. She Blinded Me With Science7. Another One Bites the Dust8. Superstition9. Somebody's Watching Me10. Great Balls Of Fire11. Wild ThingHalloween Spooky Sounds12. House of Terror13. Spooky Graveyard14. Haunted Mansion15. Halloween Zoo16. Trick or Treat17. It's Alive"
5,"Magical, Imaginative, Exciting",My kids make me read this book over and over. I purchased all of Doran-Smith's books.
1,"rip off, don't buy it! EXACT same solutions as what is available at the back of the book","I thought this book would have all the solutions, but it only has the EXACT same ones as the ones in the back of the book. This book is a rip off so don't buy it unless you want to waste your money. You are better off just reading through the book and Googleling the things you don't know online."
1,Too Wordy,"I didn't enjoy this book overall. The concept was good, but the author uses far more words than she needs to, and she seems to meander in telling the story. Made me lose interest frequently and quickly."
5,convenient,Fantastic product. Fits exactly for my Wahl clippers. I like the color coded clips as well as the rack it sits in. Makes things very convenient to place and organize
4,Quality Guide Combs,i got these to go with my set of Wahl clippers. The are quality and they stay on which is important unless you want to go from a little trim to buzzcut when the attachment falls off... i would recommend them to anyone looking to cut hair at home and i have a friend in barber college who enjoys them as well.
1,Disappointed,A waste of money. This bed is much flimsier and smaller than the picture and specs. I measured my dog and his current bed before choosing the 22inch bed but it is way too small for my boy. I wish I hadn't wasted my money.
4,Works great,"My dog seems to like this about as much as the other bed that he has. He splits his nap time between the two! Easy to clean, I just throw it in the washer/dryer and its good to go!"
2,Very Inaccesible Book,"Trotter is a spectacular chef and this book is an awesome reference for those who do nothing but cook. For anyone else, it's fairly useless.The problem is the complexity. I ran through my copy this morning and discovered that there's not a single recipe that does not feature a cross-reference to multiple recipes, some of which refer back to a preparation technique in the base recipe. For the sauce (separate recipe,) you need a stock (separate recipe,) containing a special spice sachet (separate recipe,) and---if making it together with recipe x, don't forget to prep component y between steps 3a and 3c, sub i. It's maddening---like standing between opposite mirrors.If you're a professional chef, it will make a nice addition to your reference shelf. For everyone else, steer clear."
4,Nothing worthy is easy.,"This book is clearly not for the amateur cook. But, honestly, did anyone think it would be? I have lived in Chicago 10 years and have been to Charlie's several times. The recipes in the book are good representations of what to expect at the restaurant. So, if you can master several of them, your friends can say they have eaten at Trotter's. My advice (having cooked most of the recipes in the book) is to begin a day earlier than normal, and make all the stocks, reductions, juices etc. You will be shocked how much simpler the recipes become."
5,great album,"This album is wonderful. It has all of the best songs from all of the best movies over the years, like Star Wars and Indiana Jones. I bought it to go along with the sheet music book. It is a fun cd to listen to when cleaning the house."
3,A bit disappointed,"I was disappointed that Mr. Williams 1984 Olympics theme was not there. It started with the earlier version written by someone else, not the bugle fanfare at the beginning."
3,unexpected,"Excellent sound quality, great composer, BUT...***On what other ""greatest hits"" cd do the artists re-record the material? The music is faster,has less emotional impact, and actually has emphasis on different notes and phrases.This has the same impact of a child whistling the tunes, just running through it.The really bad thing about all of this is that the tunes you bought this forsound the worst, because you're expecting something totally different.********************Sometimes sounds counterfeit. Still, this has excerpts from some great music scores and can still be enjoyed. Sounds better the second time around."
1,Way too Advanced,"I gave this a one-star review because I purchased it based on the Foreward which the author said was the definitive work on the subject of Photoshop 4.0. As a rank beginner, I was lost and overwhelmed. This tome might be excellent for the experienced Photoshop user who is upgrading, but for my purposes of learning how to use my scanner, digital camera and Photoshop software, this was not the answer. If you are new to Photoshop, look elsewhere. I am!"
4,one of the best,"this is one of the best albums i own, and I have hed to re-purchase it 3 times due to wear and tear. captures all of life's emotions in an album that draws you in ala OK Computer.a must"
2,REAL TALK this album blows,"basicly these fools needed some money for some dope or somthing, so they slapped together an album that doesnt even compare to the first felt EP. ENOUGH SAID. vegas life is a pretty sick song though"
1,Must have received a bad batch...,"I tried to record on 6 of these (4 CDRs on one computer, 1 on my computer at work, 1 on an old TDK disc recorder) before I quit trying. No workstation or recorder would recognize the media as recordable. I was lucky that the seller was gracious concerning returns."
3,Disregard Previous Poster,"I just wanted to point out to the review who claimed ""This book is filled with people who got 4.5 and above GPAs and LSAT scores of 170 and better."" It is IMPOSSIBLE to get a GPA of 4.5 in college. The highest GPA one can achieve in college is 4.33 and thats *if* the school awards an A+ for a grade of 100%. Most schools just award ordinary A's which caps the maximum GPA at 4.0."
4,An ALL Nighter,"I was absolutely amazed at the quality and depth of this book. What could have either beena stock ""man rebels against the system to the worlds greater glory"" turned out to be a bookshowing little by little a man's humanity emerging through a culture where the choices he isoffered are really no choices at all.Although I wondered at the inclusion of some of the passages, at the end of the book, the wholepattern was clear.. and again, I was amazed at the restraint used by the author. She could havesaid so much more without moving the book further forward.I am waiting, although with some trepidation, to the second, and any subsequent novels."
4,And now for something completely different ...,"Sadist SF! A new approach to the medical SF genre (cf James White's Sector General series). Here we have a new approach to healing and justice -- the medical inquisitor. An interesting story and good setup to the next in the series (there are three so far). Matthews is a very good writer, especially in these uncharted thematic territories."
1,Specs Misleading: Not for Older G4's,"I have a dual 450 powermac with 2gb of Ram running OSX 10.3.8 Panther. This product runs at USB1 speeds which defeats the purchase. Very misleading specifications don't be fooled. No CD drivers, weak to no support."
3,"After one listen to this CD, I find I like ""Tidal"" more.....",I was very disappointed that there are only 10 songs and they all fit on one side of a 90 minute tape for my car. This is something that hasn't happened since the eighties! NO ONE has that short of a cd anymore! It seems we're paying more for less product.We should be paying more for MORE product. I do like some of the songs and I will keep listening to it tho to see if more of the songs grow on me. It's just that I was hooked on Fiona after Tidal and I loved EVERY song on that cd so I am a little disappointed.
5,"fiona, to long i have waited!","they sent me tidal in '96 begging people to listen and tell for they wre weary of her talent.well i got ""when the pawn"" last night and have listened to it all night and ill keep it on till i loose the goosebumps."
2,Am I listening to the same CD?,"I read a few ""professional"" reviews on this CD and they praised this work much the same as most of the reviews here. I took a leap of faith based on what I'd read and ....the pool was empty. Am I listening to the same CD as everyone else? Every song drones into the next..and into the next... My wife made me turn it off to, ""Stop her constant groaning"". I WANT MY $14 BACK!"
2,"I loved her last album, but, this one has got to go....",I have both albums and adore the first one. This album on the other hand wasn't that great. I didn't find myself in love with any of the songs and couldn't even recall one at will. I think Fiona is much more talented than what she did on this album. Better luck next time....
4,Worth the money,"I bought it for the song ""Paper Bag"", but as it turns out, I love the whole album. Her voice is just amazing."
2,Nowhere near as complete a record as her first joint,"I loved her first record. I thought it showed not only great compositional skill, but strong production values in the songs she opted to put on it. They all seemed to fit and they weren't anywhere near as pretentious as this material is. Is she still a great songwriter? I have to assume she is, but the songs aren't that strong...it just shows a good sense of musicality and theory. No JAMS...no listenable angst or heart that doesn't drive me nuts with its sing-songy abstinence.I expected more from her second record, considering how long I'd been waiting for it.A fan waiting for the next one."
5,Best Album Ever!,"I wasn't sure if I wanted to purchase this cd, becuase of the last album ""Tidal"". I listened to ""Tidal"" at a friends home and only liked a few songs. I couldn't stop lisenting to ""When the pawn..."" after I bought it. All the songs are written by Fiona and written from the heart. I can relate to all the lyrics of all the songs and I know others can to. This is my only cd that I like every song and never have to skip forward. I'm positive that if you like just one song on the cd, you'll like every song!"
4,"A safe follow-up to the megahit, ""Tidal"".","Just finished my first listen, thanks to amazon.com's quick and reliable delivery. I like it, but it's really nothing spectacular. It is a safe follow-up to ""Tidal"" which could be a great commercial success. Ms. Apple seems to be branching out a bit, as the recording is not as ""brooding"", for lack of a more descriptive term. This is definitely not a sophomore slump, but is a very solid work. I give it a B+."
1,The Pawn is as exciting as watching a Chess Match,"Where do I begin?The first noted deficient, is the mixing of the tracks. One has to crank maximal volume to hear Fiona's voice. What is with all the dead air space on this CD? At first, I thought my CD player was not working correctly. What is with the overbearing musical background? At times, there is so little vocals, one begins to think this CD is a musical. And a bad one at that.Second problem. What happen to the vocal range of Fiona, she sounds like a asthma induced talk-sing vocalist, that can be found at any Holiday Inn lounge show. Fiona is a vocalists, I brought this CD to hear her sing, sadly I did not. Why, where her talents so brutally held back?Finally, after months of delays, one would think there would be more than 10 title tracks."
4,due south,"the music form the series was very enterining. there were original songs written and prformed by the actor Paul Gross that were very good, and can't be found anywhere else."
5,Best soundtrack I've heard.,"This is a must for the fans. If you're not a fan, you will probably enjoy it too. It has an interesting mix of music--rock to opera--none of which is harsh to the ears. I'm not one for listening to instrumental music, but when I heard the music on the shows I knew I had to have this this album. It gets an A+ from me."
4,"A MUST for fans, worth the price for everyone else!","Before you think 4 stars means I think there's something wrong with this soundtrack, I should tell you I reserve perfect scores for things (Music, books, food) that cause such pleasure as to render me unconcious. = ] If you haven't experienced due South, this could be your ticket. A sampling of original scores and commercial releases used in the program, there isn't a jarring song on the disc. A pity tho that more of the motive music wasn't included. And while you're at it, grab yourself a copy of the second dS soundtrack, it's as good but with a different attitude.Bi"
2,Not as I have imagined,"I was a little disappointed with this shampoo. I expected more, because it is not a cheap one. The smell is good, but that's it."
5,new zealand meets fairport convention,robert scott of the bats has expanded their sound with the addition of a female vocalist. comparisons to sand denny with fairport convention come to mind. this may be one of the best albums of the year.
2,Not bad.,"Fairly informative, sometimes trite, account of ghostly happenings throughout the South. The writer's dialect seems to change from story to story, making the reader think that perhaps there is more than one author. Very light reading."
2,Weak. . .,"Good voice, not great. Weak songs, not awful. Been there, done that. And no, she isn't quite at the same level of Whitney Houston or a Mariah Carey. Given better material and some restraint, she should definitely improve. Most of this album is the same Adult Contemporary drivel that is on the airwaves, combined with Britney Spears type dance songs."
3,Jessica Sings her Heart out!!,"Jessica Simpson has such a great voice that can't be beaten by any other pop diva. Most of her ballads have beautiful lyrics and she also puts a lot of feeling into it. Though, some other songs aren't good enough for her voice, like ""I Think I'm in Love with You"" has the same lyrics going on and on, which makes it kind of tiring. Well, to make a long story short, I would just buy some of her ballad singles instead of buying the whole CD."
2,Good Morals Does NOT Equate To Good Music...,"While I'll agree this woman is an excellent role model, I fail to see how this fits into the musical equation as implied by several of her fans below. Her voice is good, but not great. And quite honestly, her material is your average, run of the mill pop fluff. I find it funny that reviewers claim the other singing blond wonder, Christina Aguilera has ""no talent"" when in fact she has the most potential of any of these blond teenyboppers. Unlike Jessica Simpson, Aguilera knows how to exercise control. That said, Jessica Simpson is a talented singer and with the right material should be a force to be reckoned with."
5,There is hope for pop-rock!,"I have been enjoying Jessica Simpson for about a 6 weeks now. Jessica is a great singer with a lot of soul. I think she is much better than Brittney Spears! I wish the radio stations here in Birmingham, Al. would play her music more. I will be waiting for her next CD to be released. If you are thinking about buying this CD, don't wait any longer."
2,Before I knew she was an airhead.,"Sweet Kisses by Jessica Simpson was a cd I had back in the day, of course my music styles have changed since then, to me on her debut album Jessica can sing but the music is weak and too bubble gum. Her type of music is even poppier than Britney's was. Everyone says that she can't sing but on this disc she sings amazing especially on her first single, I Wanna Love You Forever. I think Jessica just came out at the wrong time in pop music, she was being compared to Christina and Britney, there was no way people wanted to listen to another blonde pop tart. A lot of the songs on Sweet Kisses are over-produced, it's so glossy and forgettable. Of course her recent songs are even more awful and her voice is all airy and a faded whisper now, what happened? Jessica Simpson isn't an important singer, she is just known for saying idiotic things and boy she should win an award just for that."
1,Horrid,"In a word this albums stinks. Yes this girl can belt a tune, but that doesn't mean give her horribly written songs to sing. All but a few of the songs were very placid and raw, maybe a little development could help Jessica Simpson to compete on a level with her contemporaries."
2,Nothing special,I have heard nothing on thisCD to set this music apart from hundreds of girls I haveheard sing in my lifetime. Just an average voice withlimited range.
3,Alright for a First Effort...,"I first heard Jessica's hit ""I Wanna Love You Forever"" on the radio and I thought that this young singer had potential, so I got the CD. However, it sort of disappointed me in one way or another. First of all, the fast, up-tempo tracks were not that catchy, and they do get boring after a while. I'd think Jessica does better singing ballads, and I must agree that the ballads stand out more than the up-tempo tracks. My favourite track on the album is ""Heart Of Innocence"". ""I Wanna Love You Forever"" comes a close second. Other than that, the other ballads sound okay, but do not really stand out. I still think Christina Aguilera sounds better than Jessica... but Jessica definitely sounds better than Britney. Get the CD if you have spare cash. ^_*"
3,The lowdown,"This overall, is a very cute cd. It seems Jessica's strong point is her ballads. Most of her ballads (which make up most of the album!) are very beautiful and emotionful, especially ""My Wonderful"", ""Where You Are"", and ""Your Faith In Me"". On the other hand, her fast songs can be a bit ""cutesy"". They can become a bit typical and annoying, in my opinion, especially ""I've Got My Eyes on You"". The two ones that are any good are excellent, ""Final Heartbreak"" and ""Woman In Me"". I think that if you really liked ""I'm Gonna Love You Forever"" and ""Where You Are"", you will love this album!"
1,It all sounds the same,"People who like this ""music"": Is this ode to mediocrity any different from the Christina/Brittany/Kylie pop music goop that is constantly clogging the airwaves?People must be confusing how a performer looks with how their music actually sounds. Simpson is a fine hoochie to be sure, but this stuff sounds terrible. Her controllers are not even trying to offer up anything remotely interesting musically.Buy real music, not this marketing tool by-product."
2,"Another teen ""sensation"" (sigh)","Teenage girls capitalizing on their good looks and marginal talent, cranking out monotonously sound-alike cds is a trend that apparently began with Britney Spears. Jessica is another one. Georgous girl, marginal talent, unoriginal cuts. File her with Britney, Mandy Moore and Christina Aguilera. Your teenage duaghter might love them -- if you have one. Not for any discerning adult."
1,Is she old enough to kiss?,"Why is it that underage girls want to prance around half-naked and feign strip.The next time you think you are a woman, take a look around:1)Do you live with your parents?2)Are you desperately seeking attention?3)Do you have no idea what I say when I say ""The utter lack of culture permeating our entertainment industry now can largely be attributed to the increased necessity of selling product and the diminished notions of offering quality; forget advancing music.""?4)Would you consider pregnancy just to validate your femininity?5)Is Madonna your biggest idol?If you answered 'yes' to any of these questions, then do me a favor--take 1000 Valium and don't call me. Ever."
3,Doesn't Touch The Follow Up,"I'm sorry but this has nothing on Irresistable, she overpowers the songs and every song sounds the same!"
1,my ears are bleeding,"this album is TOO loud and i didn't play it THAT loud. jessicasimpson is a mariah carey wannabe. the WHOLE album thereNO low songs ALL of them invole screaming,screeching and YELLING of the lyrics NO softly sung or gently carried lyrics. ALL are loud this album you will not like it because you WOULD NOT be able to stand listening to it for months. END"
1,Wow! Can Jessica Spit or What?,"Can she? That is the question. I believe she does more of that than sing on this album. Woe to all who buy this soundtrack! No offense but i despise this female singer almost more than Hilary Duff, whom i have very good reason to despise! Don't waste your money! By the way, does anyone know if she really can spit?"
4,Great music for general audiences,"Jessica's hit song, ""I Wanna Love You Forever"" contains hard hitting lyrics and some crescendo over the course of the song. Great voice projection I must say! Excellent work by a talented singer. Some say Jessica needs more work, but I say the composers need more work. I recommend this CD to aspiring vocalists. If it weren't for the many ""filler"" songs throughout the album, I would have given it Five stars."
4,Very good but not excellent.,"I like Jessica's voice and the CD is great, actually is one of my favorites but some songs are really pathetic like ""Woman in me"", I listen to it over and over and I just can't like it.I wanna love you forever - This song is great and is one of my favorites.I think I'm in love with you - Good lyrics, good voice and a great dance song.Where you are - This is a great duet but I think Jessica's voice is stronger than Nick's.Final Heartbreak - Great one but the beginning is kinda stupid.Woman in me - This song is pathetic. I don't really like it.I've got my eyes on you - One of my favorites except for the ""oh yeah c'mon""Betcha she don't love you - It sounds like Christina Aguilera's ""Love will find a way"" but I like it.I think Jessica's voice sounds better on balads so my favorites are ""My Wonderful"", ""Your faith in me"", ""Sweet kisses"" and the best of all ""Heart of innocence"".If you're reading this to make up your mind, I'd say this is a very good option."
2,"Waxy, sorta cheap","I guess the price was ok for the quality... but the product wasn't great... didn't do what it was supposed to do. However, it is an excellent mosturizer, if you don't mind the greasiness."
2,Disappointed,"I was looking forward to hearing the Zemlinsky symphonies. However, to my ears these compositions were simply a so-so listening experience. They are something I might listen to once every two or three years. The performances were well done but the music was boring. It could be just me but I was disappointed."
3,It's Okay...not great,This is a good basic common sense kind of book. Most of it you should know and I think that some of the milestones are wrong. One month my child is a genius and the next challenged. I just wasn't that impressed with it. I expected more because of What to Expect When You Are Expcecting was great. But this is just my opinion.
5,Just what a new parent-to- be needs!,"What To Expect the First Year, Second EdMy daughter & son-in-law were delighted to receive this book and find it to be informative, helpful and easy to read."
5,Fantastic book,I bought this as a gift for a first time mother. She says it has come in handy so many times. She travels around with it.
3,More Circumcision Info Needed,"When I purchased ""What to Expect the First Year,"" one of the things I was interested in was advice regarding whether or not to circumcise my unborn son. My research shows that the procedure is increasingly viewed as medically unnecessary and that, apparently, uncircumcised men are not at a greater risk for HIV, cancer, etc. Unfortunately, I felt that this book did not do justice to this topic. It would benefit parents to research this important topic in greater depth than the information provided in this book. I've found the following sites very useful: netdoctor.co.uk/menshealth/facts/circumcision.htm, faculty.washingtonedu/gcd/DOC/, cirp.org/ and circumcision.org/."
1,671 pages of rubbish,"It gets one star because zero stars are not an option. This book - and indeed, the entire What to Expect series - is patronizing, misleading and oftentimes dead wrong. Why educate when you can frighten? Why present basic facts and allow parents to make their own informed choices when you can lecture?In particular, beware any advice What to Expect gives with regards to breastfeeding - it is outdated, incorrect and will destroy your nursing relationship."
5,I Knew What To Expect!!!!,"Being a first-time mother is such a scary experience, but thanks to ""What to Expect"", I have felt confident during my daughter's first weeks. The question and answer format is perfect for uncertain parents. Also, the index is a wonderful resource to quick-reference any question that you might have. The tone of the book is wonderfully reassuring, and I would recommend this book to any new parent. This is a must-have!!"
2,Very little 'developmental' information,"I thought this book would be chock full of timely information given the title and size of the book. I was disappointed. I only found the first page of each chapter useful. It gave a monthly outlook of where your baby should be developmentally, where they might be, and so on. The rest of each chapter was a bunch of Q&A for unique circumstances. Information that I would probably get by calling my Doctor, not waiting to see if it were in a book. My son is now 5 months and on the suggestion of a friend, I ordered ""Your Baby's First Year Week by Week"" instead."
5,A must have for new Mom's,"I got this book after I used the ""What to expect when you're expecting"" which I loved despite it being a little preachy. Everything you'd want to know is in this book."
5,Great book,"I really liked this book. It definetly helped us through some sleepless nights. I used this book as a 1st check before picking up the phone and calling the Dr. For a first time mom, it was a God send. Very well written and easy to follow. I highly recommend this book to any 1st time parent. We have other books, but this one is tried and true. I always get the best information out of this book and quicker then other resources I own."
4,Good Read,A continuation of the fascinating spy trilogies Deighton published in the 80's. The book sucks you in and at its leisurely pace surprises you with twists and turns.
1,careful!!!,"Please be aware that below reviews are for the Sidewinder EP not for the album ""the sound isn't organized yet"" which always accidentally slips into the section of Download at Amazon and confuses fans. Don't buy it if you are looking for a Downlaod album, this release is by a band called ""twice a man"" and has nothing to do with industrial/experimental/noise ... not at all."
5,Finally one that works!,"I tried several other brands of switch based programable timers as well as a screw in light sensing switch and this is the only one that wouldn't trip our breaker. You can use it to power nearly any type of bulb. We have a 60watt(13watt) CFL bulb in an outdoor fixture and this thing works just as you would think. On at the time you set, Off at the time you set. Perfect."
4,So far so good,"I bought this product in October of 2009. I have three installed: 1 for the front outside lights, 1 for the lamppost, and 1 for the outside garage lights. The challenge is having all of the lights come on at the same time. If you synchronize all of the timers to a single clock you'll find that after time they ""walk"" slightly in either direction. I have not touched them in the last 30 days and between the three timers they may be 3-5 seconds apart. Not sure how that happens with a digital (as opposed to analog) display but that is the case here. They are relatively easy to install and set. Several programs make them flexible if you want them to come on at different times on different days."
4,Didn't work for us,"Not sure why but this unit did not work for us. Once connected, It was powered on but would not control the light. Probably something to do with our wiring. Unit itself seems good. Has lots of good options for setting up a variety of on/ off times. Bummed it didn't work for us. Guess we will still have to turn on and off the light manually (gasp! The horror!). Fast ship and fair price."
4,Very Capable Unit,"Unit is fairly easy to program. Switch amp rating is enough to power a portable electric heater, or a car headbolt/freeze-plug heater. I wish the display were back lit and the display had larger print -- a flash light is a must when programming. Don't forget to program the day of the week for the ""Off"" time, too!"
4,Awesome G1 figure,"THis was my sixth transformer toy and it is the best besides megatron he is fairly easy to transform. The only problem I have is his missle , every time I play with him he shoots his missles automatically even when I avoid pressing the button."
1,Not even G1 colors can help...,"Not even being recolored to match the G1 Starscream can help the movie design not look utterly hideous. Of all the ugly designs they did for the movie, this one ranks below only Megatron and Frenzy on the scale. Do yourself a favor and get Classics Starscream or Masterpiece Starscream instead."
5,Hilarious sequel to a lovable character,"I loved this book soooooo much! I think the character Bugs is absolutely hilarious and Korman's writing style is amazing. If you loved the first Bugs book, you'll love this one too. I think that besides the lovable, hilarious characters, this book is an amazing parody of groan-inducing family vacations. I did think it was slightly creepy how all those guys were developing crushes on Elizabeth, who's like 16, but it didn't detract from the awesomeness of this book. My only main complaint is that I miss the characters from the first Bugs book (Adam, BiBi, Barney, etc). But this book is sooooo cool!"
1,Bomberman Act: Zero X360,"This is the worse Bomberman game ever. Don't buy it!!! There are only battles with one arena. The stages are setup so you fight one person on the first round, two people in the second and so on."
3,Didn't Grab Me,"Maybe it's me, but I much preferred ""Love Cards"" by the same author. The information was easier to grasp, and the layout was easier to follow. Somehow each time I pick this up, I don't make much progress. Another issue w/ this book and ""Love Cards"" as well is the print is ridiculously small. It's great that a lot of information is packed within its pages, but books like these present serious obstacles for the visually challenged. Everybody wants to relax w/ a book, even if it's an instructional, but if you have to strain to read, that's not an option. These books are on the pricey side, and I would have appreciated a more reader friendly format.The study of cards - Cartomancy - is a fascinating topic, and I have been amazed how closely my birthday and planetary ruling card readings match the essence of who I am. If you're intrigued by the concept of reading w/ playing cards, my suggestion would be to start w/ ""Love Cards"" first."
2,"Creases, cresases, creases . . .","Patio Mats 003 6' x 9' Beige Floral Pattern Reversible Patio MatThe problem with this product can be seen in the picture . . . it has creases that do not come out even through the heat of a very hot summer. Creases are introduced in the carpet when the product is packaged and they simply do not come out. Other than that, the product is as advertised."
1,Buyer--Be Very Careful!!!!!,"I ordered this cable to transfer music to my cell phone. The cable does not work and not being a ""computer guru"" I expect I will end up throwing the cable away and going to an electronics store where I can get help purchasing something that works."
1,cable came in did not work at all!,product came in did not work at all...I am using a LGCU920...i did not get what i buy...the cable cannot even charge the cellphone even though the connector was able to connect.guess they send me the wrong cable...threw away the stupid cable!sucks!
4,"Works great on LG VX8600 for BitPim, CDMA modem, and charging","This cable works great for BitPim, CDMA modem, and charging. The first one I got failed after 10 days due to the miniUSB end coming apart when I was plugging it into the phone. This quality issue was my only complaint. It was replaced at no charge.(I did get one of another brand locally to use while awaiting replacement; it was labeled as a charging and data cable but did not charge; I exchanged it for another, which also did not charge, before I noticed the fine print on the package stating that the charge function would not work on some models. Believe me, you want the charge ability if you use the phone occasionally as a modem or if you want the ability to conveniently recharge your phone from your computer.)About the only thing I would do differently is to order two of them."
1,Didn't work,Didn't work for my phone when it said it would. Very frustrating glad I didn't pay full price for this item!
2,Cheap and built that way,"Worked OK for a couple of months under very light use. The connector on my LG VU has always been a bit stubborn, and tonight I snapped the cable end just trying to plug it in. This is too cheap. Look elsewhere on Amazon for the actual LG cable for a few dollars more, or Google for the Belkin version. Either of those should be better quality,"
1,Does not fit LG Flare,"I ordered this because it said it fits the LG Flare. It does not. How difficult can it be to make sure what models a cable really fits? Luckily another family member has a phone that it does fit, so I gave it to her."
5,great product,"Works great could you send me one of these free for buying from youReusable Screen Protector LG VU CU920 / OrCUSTOM LCD SCREEN PROTECTOR for LG VU CU920, CU915"
5,"Good Product, Cheap Price, Fast Shipping",I am buying stuff from BargainCell for the second time. The products are good and they ship it fast.
4,Complex hard rock,"Amazing debut from Swedish band. Progressive metal that takes the listener on a complex journey through a myriad of hard rock styles. Complex lyrics as well. A must for fans of the later work of this band. 64 minutes, 13 tracks."
1,Not What I Expected,"Since this is called ""the best of"" I thought they would take the funniest clips from various shows and expected to be laughing througout the dvd. Instead, they were shows in their entirety which only had maybe one or two things that the kids said that were funny."
4,Leaves You Wanting More,"This is the first book I have read by Ms. Rice and it was a really good read. I was also happy to see that Camille's character portrayed what it is really like to try to get over someone you really loved. It does take a lot of time to go on with your life and be able to not think about that person all the time. I am waiting for Ms. Rice to write a sequel to this book. I believe it would be a great idea because there are so many unanswered questions that I have, such as who left the note on Camille's desk, does she find out who her true birth mother is, and why did Nora pretend to be her mother? I was also a little disappointed that she does not give you the update on Camille's baby and that Camille did not stay with Greg. However, Ms. Rice still gets definite A Plus from me. I hope to read many more novels from Ms. Rice in the future."
1,Please don't waste you money,"Their is very little detail and almost no backroads inc with this software, if you check out google earth or maps you will find 10 times more info and their not even selling you a product its their free. Its a crying shame that this company is still in business with the poor excuse for support and software design and usability."
2,Not for hiking,"I bought eXplorer 210 for hiking.The bundle comes with Mapsend Topo 3D USA.The software is hard to use, especially not intuitive on transferring the maps to the GPS unit.I ended up using file explorer to drag the file over.The map seems somewhat outdated and there is virtually no hiking trail.This is just good for urban navigation... not sure what's the point of having topo info for urban use.I hope Mapsend would come with trail in future version.Give it 2 stars for the good urban map."
1,Not fond of Magellan,"I bought four Triton 200 Magellan GPS units for school and have yet been able to use them. Now you would think if I bought Magellan software maps to load onto them they would be compatible. But, NO, they are not. And is that in the literature anywhere? NO. I will never deal with Magellan again. What a waste of time and money it has been."
1,A waste of time and money,"This is probably the ultimate in poorly put together maps of deserted areas. Trails are wrong or not published at all. Towns that have less than 4,000 population, their streets are wrong. For off roaders, this product is the pits. period."
2,"MapSend, a do it yourself letdown","I got this software to go with my Magellan GPS, which is a great piece of hardware. The actual maps in the software are OK, but using it on a computer is painful and ponderous. For instance, when measuring distances (like planning a road trip) I haven't figured out how to both pan and measure. You get one or the other. Zooming is easy if you happen to have a scroll button mouse, but panning is very cumbersome.I really dislike their anti piracy software nanny. You load 2 of the 3 CDs on your computer, then everytime you want to use the software you have to bring the third CD along. That's not why I bought a laptop.Thales customer service for MapSend software is non existant. Manual? Get real! You're on your own here because once they get your money, they could care less about you. That's nothing at all like their hardware division."
4,Excellent intro,"This is a fine introduction to wavelets for computer scientists, with many fun applications in computer graphics. Easier than other introductions I've seen, in part because it avoids the frequency domain. I'm using it in a graduate course, but it would be easy to use by yourself or in a special seminar for undergraduates in CS or math."
2,Diffrent from the vinyl album,"I was slightly dissapointed about this cd as I do have the vinyl albums and am replacing them with the cd's. The cd has a diffrent play format than the LP. EG The Ray Charles ""oh yeah"" part is not on the cd. Also the tunes are in a diffrent order on the cd. This is the case with most of the cd's in the series. The series could do with digital remastering which would help with the sound quality of the radio DJ's. All in all not a bad series."
1,Do not buy this item,I replace all my struts in my ca with sensa trac struts and it sound like I never put them I will not buy this item again
3,Racing harness,I like ti because of the color which I prefer... I would recommend it to anyone who is just starting in amateur or novice races...
2,Stick with the original,"Provocative and entertaining? Afraid not. Plodding and uninteresting. I thought the original was a tough nut to crack, but this is just painful. I suggest one study Beethoven's version; its rewards are many."
3,If your new to web servers this book isn't for you.,If you are familiar with Apache 1.3 and want to learn about all the great new features of 2.0 this book may be for you. Bloom does not hold your hand with step by step instructions. The Complete Reference is exactly what this is but all this information can be found in the free documentation that comes with Apache.
2,Beginners RUN!,Wow I was lost in the first 50 pages. Threw that book away. Might be good for programers that know some of the stuff. Very hard to follow book. Never going to buy another book without Amazon.
4,Insightful Observations,"This admittedly anecdotal account of the differences between men and women provides a great number of insights into the male experience/neuroses in 21st century America. As a man, I found it useful in appreciating my own behavior and reactions. At the same time, it was helpful to see how little an intelligent, political woman understood of the male perspective until she threw herself into it."
1,Don't Believe the Hype,"Before disappearing and 'living as a man', Vincent was infamous for publishing truly hateful columns against transgender and transsexual people in the gay press. After all that backlash, I guess she got the idea that she could make a big splash exploiting the lives of cross dressers by 'fooling' everyone and writing a book about it. I checked this thing out of my library and it did nothing but confirm my suspicions--nothing of real substance here. It seems that Vincent is shocked to discover that men are..human beings, as flawed and vulnerable as any woman could be. Maybe someday she'll discover that transgender people are indeed human as well. Or maybe she'll grow up and transition herself. Who knows? Bottom line: don't spend money on this tripe or support this foolish woman."
5,Costly gold,"More books with such blunt gender findings should be written!Unfortunately, the author paid for her pose with something of a nervous breakdown."
4,Very Insightful,"I got this book thinking that it was an interesting premise, and I would read it as I might watch a reality TV show. By the first chapter though. I realized that in addition to be being a good writer, Vincent is incredibly insightful about gender issues and the differences between and female, homosexual and hetero. This is a book I actually would up learning something from"
1,BLAH...BLAH...BLAH....NOTHING NEW HERE...,"When I read a book like this I am reminded that books can't be returned. Why not? If you buy a shirt and then decide you don't llike it you can bring it back. But if you slog through a book and don't like it, you're screwed! It's false advertising. Here's my advice: SAVE YOUR MONEY. There are no insghts in this book that you wouldn't glean from watching Sex in the City: Season One!! Plus that's funnier and free!"
2,ripped book,"When the book arrived there was a missing chunk out of the paper cover. I was very disappointed since the review given by the seller said ""almost new"""
4,The Ultimate Ethnography,"What better way to understand than to become? Norah Vincent articulates masculinity today as no man can, and even as no woman can, or at least no woman who doesn't consider herself a lesbian. This is an insightful glance at the burdens of being a man today, well told through the lens of one who knows the burdens of being a woman. It's an entertaining look at the pressure our culture places on gender behavior."
3,Kick a guy when he is down?,"Norah (Ned) does the best that she can to be an undercover man with a woman's body. While I think that in general she does a well as she can I have to take away some points for her snide remarks that seem to creep up every few pages? It isn't enough that she infiltrate our community, she has to come down hard on traditions that men have evolved over the 30+ years that we have been around. Obviously I don't expect and expert but I could do without the `holier-than-thou' and low-blows that she makes."
4,Self Made Man : In my opinion.,"I was anxious to read this book after hearing about it.I ended up with some mixed emotions on the content.I'm not a very good reviewer so bear with me.I'll just say that I wasn't as entertained by the book as I had hoped. I did like the mix of entertainment and analytical content at first, but after a while I felt like it became too interspective and less entertaining.I will say that Norah Vincent is an excellent analyst, but maybe not such a good story teller."
1,Thinly Veiled Marketing Brochure,"The title of this book claims that it is a book about the ""Essentials of Patents."" The information about patents could be distilled down to just a few pages. What the rest of the book discusses is about selling the author's idea of a patent management program for big companies."
5,magnetic power of her beauty !!,"She has wonderful tone like her teacher Hakan Hardenberger,but more coolish."
5,This book is worth having,"We have this book and once we have our little girl home, it will be used over and over again. The story is a great way to talk about adoption and the differences between parent(s) and child. Perfect for anyone who has adopted or will be adopting internationally. I recommend this book highly and the illustration work is wonderful!"
5,A Delightful Find!,"I read that the author was one of Julia Quinn's favorites, and so tried this title. So glad I did! The story was wonderfully twisted, the character, vibrant, and the prose, absolutely luscious. Boiling it down: I had a great time reading this, and couldn't wait until I could pick it up again to continue reading. When I finished, I purchased another JAL book and wasn't disappointed in the least. Very recommended!"
2,"""Why did this book get such good ratings?""","All I can say is this was a dry one. It had potential to be a good read but it just did not make the cut. The hero Connor seemed like a big duffus for some reason. His character was way under-developed...I mean like BLAH. I like Rebecca'a character. However, she just did not fit in this story. The plot was pretty good but something was missing."
1,Can't believe it was published,"This book is absolute rubbish. A DUKE poses as a groom for 5 years - come on! He is supposed to be Irish but all the dialect he speaks is Scottish and he constantly calls the heroine ""wee Becca"" - her name is Rebecca - which was getting on my nerves. And it seems that no matter what part of England he goes the 2 thugs who are after him always find him - whether he is posing as the groom or an aristocrat. They just seem to materialize right in front of him and of course he always fights them off. Well it seems my review is the opposite of everyone elses. I also bought her other book but I am having second thoughts about reading it."
2,Seriously lacking,"Stephanie Laurens, Julia Quinn and others made to top name company for their effort, this book was too wordy for its on good. maybe next time if your not trying to take up space or the number of pages to fill."
4,This CD is a great listen!,"It shares many contemporary elements and is very original and entertaining listen. If you are like me and appreciate real music, you will enjoy this album."
1,An idiots guide on HOW NOT TO WRITE A KIDS BOOK,"Tom Ogren should stick to his day job. He's obviously either a) not a father, or b) the type of guy who would run out on his wife with a couple of little kids at home. This book was superficial and had a leftist slant that left this father of four cold."
5,Excellent Historically-Based Ficion on the Oregon Trail!,"The most famous book about the Sager family is probably ""On to Oregon!"" by Honore Morrow, on which the movie, ""Seven Alone,"" is based. But ""Stout-hearted Seven,"" is based on more thorough research and is more accurate. This is the one our fourth grade teachers usually read aloud as part of their curriculum on Washington State, and it's the title that most students will come into the library to check out and read again.While there are many good fictional accounts about the Oregon Trail, this is the one I'd recommend first for upper elementary grades, simply because of its basis in actual events.I'd also recommend visiting the Whitman Mission in Walla Walla, if for no other reason than to see the wagon wheel ruts and the Sager names on the gravestone. Our family did this a few years ago as part of a quick 5-day trip along the Oregon Trail, starting in Independence, Missouri. If we ever go again, I'd prefer to take at least two weeks."
1,"oh man, what a let down","Let's just hope that their new album ""The ever passing moment"" isn't this bad. Mike please stick to playing the bass. There are a couple of okay songs don't get me wrong but for the most part you could tell it was an experiment."
1,Are they serious???,"At $16.99, the Kindle Edition of this book is MORE EXPENSIVE than the hardcover edition, which is $16.32. WHY????????????? What could POSSIBLY be the reason for charging more for an electronic copy than for the hardcover edition which uses paper, ink, binding, and has production costs. GREEDY, IGNORANT PUBLISHERS! Shameful."
4,Very nice selection of French Canadian Christmas music,Pretty rare to find this selection of music. The performances on this CD are perfect for creating a nice ambiance for Christmas dinner.
4,"Inspiring, a great must-have CD for the Holidays!","I see that every review here talks about Della Reese's performance, but I have to say that Donna Summer's Christmas Spirit song taken from her Christmas CD by the same name, is truly the gem in this collection. If you really like it, I suggest that you pick up Donna's Christmas Spirit holiday CD. You will be pleasantly surprised."
5,Daisy Cooks: Latin Flavors that will Rock your World,"Great variety of basic Latin Dishes. I have notoriously been bad at making rice (either over or under-cooking), but with Daisy's recipe, I have finally prevailed in creating the perfect pot of basic rice!Very tasty and easy to understand instructions, as well as useful explanation of ingredients and substitutions if some ""exotic"" flavors can't be found."
5,Excellent book!,"I really enjoyed this book b/c it explained so well many puertorrican dishes in terms I could never find. I showed it to my hispanic coworkers (who are not caribbean) and they now understand what I am talking about when I mention ""sofrito"" and ""ajices"", etc.I purchased 2 extra books to give as gifts!"
4,I've Met Some Great Women In the Bible That I hadn't heard of before!,"I use this for a class at church. It only takes about 30 minutes. I feel that we learn from it and the questions also help you gear it towards you life today. Perhaps it could go a bit deeper. However, on some of the women that would probably be harder."
5,my 2nd grader acutally liked it,"I got this book to help my daughter with her schoolwork. We did a couple of pages, and next thing i knew she kept on going without me. I was very happy that she liked the book and learned a great deal. I recommend it to anyone who has a elementary school child"

2,Too many anecdotes,"I have heard a lot about Denis Waitley, but was disappointed with this set. It was padded with several lengthy anecdotes, to which I wouldn't want to listen more than once or twice. I didn't find much of interest or use here."
1,nothing new in his claim,"so many false claimants happened and so will be in future.He tried to trape his readers in the web of numbers but totally failed.he claims his name as RASHAD KHALEEFA...CODED IN QURAN..BUT WHEN he added his name to prove his baseless claim he just added 1st part of his name :rashad..not adding KHALEEFA.caz it proves his claim just a trash itself.The number value of his full name is 1230 not 505.this very 1st thing proves him a liar just like other liars .Besides that there are so many people whos name( even the animals names) cotains the number value of 505 so whats special with this insane so called khaleefa .should every person claim prophathood just because his name value is 505,then what about those anemals having the same number value..what a pitty."
3,NOT WHAT THE OTHER REVIEWER SAID IT WAS LOL,"So i read the other reviewers review and was entrigued. Bought it blindly and I regret it. Not worth owning. Its corny at times, very inconsistent. There are a couple decent songs but overall it comes short. I'm not even sure how to label them because there their sound is so inconsistent. Some songs are synth pop, some are big beat, theres even a random progressive rock song lol plus the cd case i got was broken."
4,"Good, but have seen this before","While he is one of my favorite authors, I must admit that certain things were quite confusing to me. Just some details of the story. Some inconsistancies too, but maybe in my own mind. Anyway, the story is basically good but it echoes from a previously unfinish trilogy (hint, hint) that involves, well, things moving. In any case, the series was enjoyable."
3,Nice looking but seem to run small,"I liked the high visability of these gloves but estimate that they were two sizes smaller than described. The second issue is that they have a soft liner within a more durable shell. I did not like that the liner would partially pull out when I removed a glove from my hand. I would have preferred a one piece construction. I can't comment on waterproofness, insulation properties or durability since I had to return them due to the size issue. I orderred an XXL. They do look nice, however."
4,An excellent aid in prayer,"This simple devotional book is filled with a variety of popular prayers for use during Holy Hours, reconciliation, and other occasions. We make regular use of the litanies and novenas for family prayer time.The collection also includes such popular prayers as the Golden Arrow prayer, Grace after meals, acts of contrition, the divine praises, the magnificat, prayer of St. Francis of Assisi and St. Thomas More, and many many others. It's a great resource to add to your bookshelf of prayer books.One minor irritation are the occasional spelling errors in the book. Otherwise this is a helpful little collection."
3,Battery glitch,"This is my first PDA and I was happy with it until I could no longer recharge the battery. I exhausted all of the suggestions on Handspring's FAQ page with no improvement. If you buy it, put up the extra money to get the longest warranty you can...you just might need it."
3,What the Hell was that?,You may look at the cover and be turned off but but don't be. This is one wicked funny movie. Its the most obscure thing I've ever seen. Give it a try.
1,"cannot upgrade, cannot convert","Willpower is acceptable, as far as its function goes. It provides a scheme for detailing your assets, and a boilerplate Will and Last text. It's not clear, however, that the scheme couldn't be done comparably with a spreadsheet. In addition, the Will and Last text often needs editing, for the legal language is convoluted so it can be massaged by a computer program to handle the cases checked.However, Kiplinger provides NO UPGRADE from one year's Willpower to another, something which you'd think would be important as laws change. I was talked into buying a completely new version, which I did. Guess what: The new version has NO MEANS OF IMPORTING INFORMATION from the older version. That means you have to enter all your property all over again.The lack of a means of importing information is why I rated this at One Star. Otherwise it'd get a Three Stars.I'm on the hunt for a third-party conversions program. I may write one myself."
1,Huge let down.................,"After reading several great reviews, I decided to buy this book.I have never read anything from Suzanne Forster before. I am a huge fan of Tami Hoag, Sandra Brown, Linda Howard, Lori Foster, Susan Johnson. But, I'm always on the look-out for new authors and thought I'd give her a try.I'm not sure why I even finished the book! Exasperating! This book had sooooooo much potential but it dragged on and on and on...... Come on!!! ""Sophie"" was a weak, neurotic woman with no backbone. ""Jay"" was the only decent thing about the book. He was the only reason why that I finished the book. ...don't waste your money. Buy a piece of bubble gum instead."
3,This is the only S. Forster book that has disappointed me.,"In this book, Ms. Forster left plot holes large enough to drive a truck through. I got the feeling that she decided that the book was long enough, so let's just write a few sentences to connect any loose ends, and cash the royalty check.The characters remained flat and never had a chance to develop. I hope her next work returns to her previously excellent, captivating storytelling."
3,It ok.,Used this for my Halloween prop. The box I got in it was bet up and the Idem it self was too. I still kept it just cause it was for a Costume. I Don't think I would buy one to decorate my bout or house tho. With the Money I spent. Wouldn't want to buy another bet up one.
2,"I agree, shutter problems ruin an otherwise great camera","I bought this camera brand new and took it on 2 trips to Eastern Europe in 2002, 2003 for about 2 weeks each. I liked all aspects of this camera. During the next years I only shot about a roll each year and kept the camera stored and safe in a special cabinet. I went back to Eastern Europe in 2010 and the shutter froze on the very first shot. Will cost 160 dollars to repair, according to the local USA camera shop. So, I have to agree with other customers that shutter problems marr an otherwise appealing camera."
3,"NOT REAL CHROME, PLASTIC!","I bought this to replace my original black tailgate handle that broke recently from a friend pulling to hard. I bought this one for $5 more than the black plastic one in hopes that this ""Chrome"" one would not break as easily. But, it's not ""real chrome"" it's plastic with a shiny chrome-like finish on it. This is really misleading because one purchasing real chrome would assume it's shiny metal. There is no where in the description that says otherwise and I'm extremely disappointed.That being said, it fit and works properly, like the old one. I decided to keep because it wasn't worth 5 bucks to return it and order the other one, and it does at least match the other handles on the door. But, beware if you are like me and think this is a metal handle, it's not, and consider the black plastic if you want to save $5!"
5,The Perfect Prelude,"I was sitting in a movie theatre, alone. The dimly lit surroundings, chatter of people talking and eating popcorn and candy, and the slide show that you watch before the movie starts... all normal. The radio is playing (which is actually a cd that is set on repeat) and a song comes on which is introduced as Deckard with a song from the Friends Again cd: What Reason. Awesome! I have to have this song! I search Napster for four months until I find the song on mp3. It takes another 2 months to find the Deckard ep. ""Still"", a wonderfuly melodic song, ""Follow the Swallow"", catchy and strong, ""Sycamore"", sweet and driving... the Deckard ep, a perfect prelude to their new cd which I now cannot wait for to be released. Melody, power, grace, and feeling... if you love these things in the music you listen to, you will love Deckard and the Deckard ep. In fact, the only thing you will hate is the fact that the ep is only four tracks!"
4,Bangin',"Yeah, I thought this CD was bangin'. You know, it's not the best work of madlib's, but it's very good. As for Declaime, he flows well and has a funny voice. This album sounds similar to the Lootpack album, but a little more upbeat. Track #16 is a very funny skit. This album follows a general patttern of one song followed by a musical interlude. So, only about fifteen of the thirty tracks have real songs. If you like Madlib then you should definitely cop this."
2,Journeys into a Mythical Past,"Sitchen has some interesting notations on Egypt and relations within Mesopatomia, however, I found this book to be below average in terms of Egyptian history and evolution. I enjoyed his previous books more..."
2,Not so great!,This book does not have much to offer. I didn't find it to be illuminating; just a rehash of old knowledge. None of it's sources can be authenicated.
1,Sucks,"I thought I was getting the actual lost books of the bible but indeed what I got was the catholic books, which I have no interest in."
4,"Interesting, But Dated Commentary","Originally published in 1926, the 1979 edition of this work purports to illustrate religious works ""not included"" by the compilers of the New Testament. It is an interesting read, with each book prefaced by scholarly opinions of how legitimate the material is. Some books directly echo the accepted New Testament, such as the book `Infancy' and `Mary'; others have the same title, such as `Ephesians', with some of the same ideas as found in the New Testament. Others, such as the books dealing with Pontius Pilate, seem to contain historical inaccuracies (such as who exactly the Roman emperor was at the time), which lead to doubt about authenticity (although it is interesting to read). I would recommend this book, although it is dense, and the print is NOT reader-friendly, as a companion piece to other `apocryphal' literature, but a newer edition might be more instructive."
3,lost bible books,"I did more skimming than reading . Written as the bible is , hence it is suppose to be from that era . Doles give some alternate views to make ytou think ."
2,Worst The Rasmus album (bad debut),Ghostbusters- 7/10Postman- 7/10Fool- 7/10Shame- 7/10P.S.- 8/10Julen Ar Har Igen- 6/10Frog- 6/10Funky Jam- 8/10Outflow- 8/10Myself- 9/10Life 705- 5/10Small- 9/10
2,Price per bar is incorrect,"Since Quaker has started only putting 8 bars in a box instead of 10 bars in a box, Amazon's price per granola bar is incorrect. It's really not as good of a deal as it used to be. =("
5,DON'T GET THIS.,"All of the small 6"" dolls are bad!If anyone from Irwin is reading this then FIX YOUR SAILOR MOON DOLLS!Just spend more time on them and alot of people will buy them even if it cost more to make.It will pay off in the long run because people wont a beter qualaty doll and they will pay more for a beter doll.DUHHHH?"
5,COOL TOY!!! by Devin Stanley,"I got this doll and Tuxedo Mask last Christmas and I'm still playing with them! My Sailor Moon doll s my favorite toy! The only bad thing is her hair is kind of gettin messed up from me playing with her so much, and her face looks more like a baby's than Serena's, but it's close enough. Sailor Moon fans out there, BUY THIS TOY!!!"
2,"16:9 frame boxed as 4:3 - why, oh why?","The film is the film; others have reviewed it, and you can find more info about it elsewhere. This particular DVD is given to us in 4:3, with the 16:9 original picture boxed inside the full frame. This wouldn't be so terrible except that the subtitles are hardcoded. So, if you have a widescreen TV, you have two choices: watch the film in full 4:3 mode, with black bars at the top, bottom, and both sides of the picture; or zoom in on your TV and lose the subtitles. Makes this particular DVD useless except for those who know Korea, and if you know Korean than you've probably already gotten the R3 disk from Korea.Some transfers, like Madeo, are great. Others, like this one, are terrible. Avoid this DVD. Film's okay."
3,"Fine scanner, but check the software....","This scanner was purchased to do heavy duty technical work for two university courses I'm preparing. It delivers high quality scans quickly using the software provided. However, there's a big problem if you want to use Macintosh OS X, the new Apple OS. Epson's drivers operate neither in native OS X nor in Classic mode. Instead, you've got to shut down and boot up in OS 9.2. I wish I had understood that before purchasing this scanner."
1,Cheaply Looking & Made,"I recently ordered this item, and was disappointed. The chain is of poor, cheap quality, which makes the necklace look tacky. I've bought necklaces in the same price range of much better quality. I will be returning this item, along with the other items I ordered from Nvie, also of cheap quality."
5,Excellent Cast of Stars!!,"I own this and the 1977 original broadway cast recording and I like them both very much! I REALLY enjoyed hearing the original Annie (Andrea McArdle) sing a great solo in ""NYC"". Even Kathy Bates does a good job singing in ""Little Girls."" Excellent cast of stars, great vocal performances, and beautiful orchestrations make this cast recording a winner!!"
4,Wow! Just as good as the original.,"This redone version of Annie is simply amazing! Kathy Bates gives a performance equal to Dororthy Loudon. Likewise my two favorite actors ever: Kristin Chenoweth and Alan Cummings make the cd for me... even if they sing 1 song... Victor Garber is equally impressive. One of the biggest highlights however would be Audra McDonald playing Grace (WoW!) and the person I know you all want to hear about: Alicia Morton who played Annie. She is cute and sings great! I don't know about her acting as I have not seen the movie yet (two more days! ) The only think I dislike about this cd is the cut songs: Hooverville, Annie, You won't be an orphan for long, and the Cabinet Tomorrow."
3,Grrrrrrr!!!,"Hmmm, ok, The orchestrations were magnificent, but they had been been wasted on Alicia Morton, I am SO SICK of ppl saying that she was fantastic , brilliant, ect. in the role. Couldn't they have had someone who could at least SING?!! her acting was ok, But you can't really say the same for her ""singing"", her voice was straight tone and at times she sang painfully out of key, She did not use any proper vocal technique, Hell, She didn't even belt! She sounded like a chipmunk. Annie's voice needs to be stong, and ""Tomorrow"" requires MUCH more VOCAL POWER!!!!! You have not yet heard Annie sing until you Hear Louanne, Andrea McArdle, Brittny Kissinger or Even Sara Jessica Parker!!!"
3,Not bad at all,"Well I came across the soundtrack by accident and as I haven't actually seen the movie version (I live in the UK) I can only comment on what I hear.There are noticable changes from the stage musical as well as the original movie, as you would expect with someone like Disney getting involved, whether it is for the best I am not sure. The character Annie - played by Alicia Morton, is probably the best recorded Annie I have heard, she has a lovely voice.Kathy Bates is not very convincing as Miss Hannigan when singing, Little Girls and to be honest I wasn't overly impressed with Alan Cumming as Warbucks.There are a lot of dancing sequences which probably explains the lack of the full chorus of people singing in numbers.After all that, the CD is worth getting if you liked the movie (which I probably will never be able to see over here!) or if you love the Annie story!Happy listening"
5,"Great Tasting, Great Texture, Lots o' Fiber and terribly overpriced","This is the great cereal of my childhood (which used to be produced in a town named ""Wheatenaville"", honest! It has tons of fiber and a nutty taste and really stick-to-the-ribs breakfast. Even my little 18 month old grandson loves it.Glad I could find it at Amazon. However, one caveat: the price that its sold at plus shipping makes this a gourmet indulgence indeed. Buyer, beware. You've gotta love it to buy it. However, I bought a case of it anyway."
5,wheatena,This is really good stuff but it is not sold where I live so I don't get it very often. I used to eat it all of the time but for some reason they stopped selling it here.its good for you too.
2,Doesn't work for me,"I don't know if this works for other people, but it didn't do anything for me. Would not use again."
2,L-carnosine,I took it as directed and didn't notice any difference or result in any way. It may be that one has to take this regularly for months to show any improvement. I just tried one bottle. I've decided to work on a healthier diet than take more supplements.
5,should be required reading for anyone thinking about embarking psychedelic experience,"Written in in wonderfully evocative narrative prose, this book is one of the best first person perspectives on what its like to be under the influence of psychedelics. Going beyond a mere description, Huxley proves himself once again to be one of the greatest american writers as he draws conclusions on the nature of Zen, buddhist mindfulness and the origins of heaven and hell. Open this book to any page and read some random paragraph and you will immediately have your mind blown clean off your current perspective of reality."
3,Somewhat disappointing,"Not bad, but definitely disappointing. The beginning of the book is a chronicle of an entheogenic experience not that much better than those that can be found at erowid. Or at least not as better as the intellectual weight of the author might lead one to expect. Perhaps this is unavoidable when talking about the unspeakable. Later the author makes a series of very well-made and articulated points about the relation between mind-altering substances and society. The particular edition I read is also greatly improved by the presence of supplementary material (reviews, commentary, fragments of other books, etc.)"
2,Not as good as expected,"For a book that is famous as a turningpoint in the study of man's perceptions, the book somewhat misses the mark. It is written in a fragmented style with too many offbeat references. Some of the points are good but they are portrayed in a terse manner which makes the book an overall dissapointment."
1,outdated,"These are two essays from Huxley (the brilliant mind that brought us Brave New World) about the psychadelic experience. BUt I found them to be ponderous and outdated. Important books in the sixties, manuals to counter culture even, but nothing more than a mere curiousity nowadays."
3,rev,"Great author. I must recognize it wasn't what i expected. Huxley portraits the very first time he tripped on mescaline. a detailed description of his experience is made, what and how he felt, saw and heard, under the drug effects. what is most fascinating about the book its the continuous reference to art, as the author encounters himself in a sort of art gallery. he describes famous pieces under ""enhanced"" perception. i found it amazing to contrast his description by viewing the paintings online while reading.thou i hoped to find more analysis on perception and consciousness, huxleys delightful writing caught my attention at every moment.what i don't know is why he used this title as it is the name given to a poem by william blake. also used by jim morrison for naming the band. i think in those days every one was too high to come up with original names and titles. haha just kidding.any way great book, if you're into huxley i recommend you read a happy world too."
5,Great Book,It's been years since I've read this book but I remember specific verses that are too beautiful to describe. This is a must have for anyone's library.
4,Longmire,"My wife actually read this book. She said it had a good plot with plenty of twists, turns and mystery in it. We are both fans of Longmire on TV."
5,Skin like silk,"I love Yonka products and have used them since I was a teenager. I stopped once I was on my own, but got burned by the cheaper drugstore products along the way (not literally). I got a rash on my face from Neutrogena and immediately went back to Yonka. It cleared up quickly leaving a clearer and more radiant me! I highly recommend these products, just go to their website to read about which one is for you because not every moisturizer is for anyone. Then come back here and get a bit of money knocked off your product. It's worth it if you are willing to pay for it, and it smells so good!"
4,The Moon and Antarctica,"MM's newest Cd The Moon and Antarctica is a good CD, but for most MM fans it will be quite a suprise. With the use of such things as a violin and a banjo, The Moon and Antarctica shows fans that MM has expanded their musical range. The question is will they lose that raw edge that made them such a popular band with independant UP records?"
3,"Don't know why he's musing about the universe, but if it inspires songwriting, OK then...","This and Good News for People Who Love Bad News are the only Modest Mouse albums I own. Unlike some Modest Mouse listeners, I'm not a rabid fan of these guys. They're just another band I enjoy listening to. This album has a drugged-out, disturbed feel to it. It's not entirely depressing, only a few songs are, but it's full of drugged-out musings that don't really make sense. Some of my favorite songs on this album are ""3rd Planet,"" ""Tiny Cities Made of Ashes,"" ""A Different City"" and ""The Cold Part."" The music is pretty cool, although some songs go on too long. The songs have good variety - unlike many albums of original music that I've listened to - and after many listens I still am discovering new parts of many songs. So the album should not bore you. Whether you can stand some of the band's weirdness is an acquired taste though, I guess.These guys need to release another album it's been 2 years now hasn't it?"
4,"prepare to be amazed...not by my review, but how amazing this album is","I remember the first time I heard Modest Mouse. I was moved by Isaac Brock's sense of timing and lyrical punches. I thought that nothing could ever top The Lonesome Crowded West (and to me still nothing has), but this record came pretty damn close. From the opening note on the first track, 3rd Planet, I could feel my my heart slowly begin to drift away...right into the sea of Brock's haunting voice. And every track takes you somewhere new until you realize that you're eventually not even on this planet anymore. I absolutely love this record, for personal reasons and because they truely do raise the bar with every record they produce. If you're a fan of Good News, you owe it to yourself to hear the roots of this amazing band"
2,Overrated,"I felt compelled to write a review based on what I was reading about the new MM record. The band is great, Lonesome Crowded West was fantastic, live shows are definitely worth seeing..but M&A is a lackluster effort. After a solid first track, the album loses focus and wanders around before rediscovering some of the lost energy with 'Paper Walls', and then petering out with a mediocre ending. Is that worth 4 stars? I haven't seen grade inflation like this since college. If every album gets 4 and 1/2 stars on average, what is the point of a review? I thought we were supposed to be more objective than the critics who run the risk of getting canned for an offensive review. Comparisons to the utterly overrated OK Computer exacerbate the problem. If MM want to sound like Radiohead, I'd rather not be around to see the transformation. Buy The Lonesome Crowded West or This is a Long Drive...., but please don't make Moon and Antartica your first MM purchase."
4,gotta have it,"do not compare these to modern movies even tv movies back then the budgets were so low it is kinda sad, think what the could have done with the money ncis gets!I did enjoy them watched them with my folks kind of a tradition good wholesome entertainment.the Armageddon one is more violent than most episodes were, there is also some morbidity.still much cleaner than anything on tv except maybe the cooking channel.no idea why but there is also a totally foreign British taste and feel to these movies no idea why but prepare for the brogue."
3,Continuous speech recognition needs a VERY fast CPU and RAM,"Those that say this software is ""unstable"" do not take into consideration the VERY high cpu usage needed to perform continuous speech recognition (as ooposed to ""discrete"" speech dictation used in IBM VoiceType, which was possible on a Pentium 1 233 Mhz, and required users to pause between words).In short: get a gigabyte of ram, specially if you're using WinXP. If you run Win2000 with 512MB ram, try to add an extra 256mb stick.And your cpu should be at the very least a 2Ghz Pentium 4, or higher, despite what the box claims. With these requirements in mind, the software works as advertised in my experience."
1,Horrible product,"I'v installed two of these pieces of junk and neither worked. The first went dead after about a week, the second reads wet when it dry and often loses it's link to the controller even though it's about 20' away."
4,Easy To Use,works like a charm out of the box. A minor adjustment to 1/2 way on the rain gauge was all that was required.
3,"Device good, software out of date","The device itself was nice enough, and works as expected.The software does not work with recent XPs, even with the supplied upgrade CD. Also, Magellan has ceased supporting the software, it seems, so no upgrades are available on the net, either.In addition, the supplied upgrade CD was supplied with a label that cause imbalance, and the CD drive to shake a lot.I managed to get things to work properly, but it took a lot of effort (find old machines)."
3,I enjoyed this book,"This is not really a review, I am a reader and no one is paying me to review books. I love to read and read ""Little Women"" my first novel at 8 years of age. I am a college graduate and love to read, sometimes I just want a good love story, historical romances are predictable enjoyable light reading, I don't expect much more. I do resent all the 5 star reviews that they all seem to some how get. I just like to share my opinion when some are good, or great or really really bad. This one was good, not more, not less. Worth the price, its a full length novel."
1,Worse read ever!!,"After reading the wonderful reviews for this book, I wonder if I purchased one of the first or last books to come off the assembly line. I liked the story line but the book was almost impossible to read. There were so many misspelled words, words dropped and words repeated I frequently found myself imagining what the author meant in a paragraph. I read this on a kindle so I doubt that that should have made a difference. Whomever is doing her editing is not doing a good job. I've read thousands of books but this was the worse."
3,Good,I just purchased viavoice. I read what other users mentioned about usability. It is like any new program. It involves a learning curve. I had my program running on XP. I disabled security during installation and re- enabled after installation.. You just have to tweak it for your system. I called tech support and they told me I should have brought Dragon. I decided to stay with viavoice and after voice test the software recognizes your voice. It is a good program.
4,Should be taught in every american history class,THE BOOK WAS GIVEN TO ME BY MY 85 YEAR OLD AUNT & IT WAS VERY INSIGHTFUL. SHE TOLD ME THAT IN THE 30'S & 40'S POPLE KNEW THIS INFORMATION BUT KEPT QUIET BECAUSE OF RACIAL TENTIONS IN THE COUNTRY AT THAT TIME. I THINK THAT MORE BOOKS LIKE THIS WILL EVENTUALY BECOME STANDARDS IN CLASSROOMS.
4,sleeping bag great,the sleeping bag came timely and is great. The fabric bag the sleeping bag stores in is cheaply made and has already ripped at the handle but the sleeping bag itself keeps her warm and cozy and she loves it. We just roll it up and tie it with ribbon so the case isn't really an issue.
2,Same as standard small block,I was looking for more than a rebuild manual. This book is the same as the basic small block rebuild with the minor dif.
1,Doesn't play nice with wifi,"I bought this item and found out it doesn't play nice with wifi. My phone, a Samsung A717, connected fine and played music. My phone does have EDP. I was unable to control the volume, and the sound ""skipped"" a lot. The it cut out entirely, and any attempt to reconnect failed. I have to power cycle the device, and the I can reconnect and get a few more minutes of music.Not recommended.Does not play nice with Wifi."
3,"Love the movie, hate the Warner Archives issue!","My only copy of this, my favorite 'Psychotronic' TV-movie, was one I recorded onto VHS from WTBS one afternoon in the late `80s. I was willing to order the special overpriced 'Warner Archives' (Warner burned-to-order) copy (pictured) (that you have to wait for a couple weeks for while they do it)thinking I would get a nice clean, uncut copy. WRONG!!!! The color, picture quality, and sound is atrocious- much worse than my old one from TV. What's more, this copy is only 71 minutes- 7 minutes shorter than the original film is reported to be. What's going on here, Warner? You don't want anyone selling ""unauthorized"" copies yet this is the best you can provide fans? It's a disgrace. I waited over two weeks for Warner to send this and considered asking for a refund, but I think I waited too long. My advice is wait and see if this gets officially released- this is dvd-r and may not even play on some decks."
4,ANOTHER GREAT TV MOVIE GETS SNUBBED FOR DVD RELEASE!?,"This is a classic TV movie and one of the best of the time period! This film has some creepy moments and a good story. This film and ""Don't Be Afraid Of The Dark"" deserve DVD treatments."
4,Misogynist? Yeah. Bad book? No!,"It appears I'm in the minority here, but I actually thought this was a strikingly beautiful book. Yes, I agree that Hawk's emotional baggage is excessive, but romance novels wouldn't do much business if the characters trusted one another and fell in love with clear communication and easily understood emotions! :) Perhaps the metaphors were a bit excessive, but I still found the story beautiful.That said, I wish romance writers (Lowell included) wouldn't seize on a specific ""theme"" and replay it continuously throughout all their books. In this case, Lowell seems very fond of the theme of a woman selflessly giving all of herself, then the man finally coming to his senses on the last two pages. That theme is repeated through this book."
4,Prolotherapy worked when nothing else did,"I struggled with major chronic back pain for 2+ years. I went to numerous doctors and tried physical therapy (2 different therapists), massage therapy, chiropractic care (2 different chiropractors), and even accupuncture. Nothing worked. I thought I was doomed until prolotherapy.The book is an okay read. I think the author goes a little over the top. But it gives you a basic understanding of what prolotherapy is, why it works, why other things might not work or make things worse. It is written with a lay person in mind rather than a doctor, so don't be afraid of a bunch of mumble-jumble.Prolotherapy itself gets 5 stars (or more), but I downgraded because much of the information in the book can be found on the web. I still bought the book and read it. If you are unsure or curious about prolotherapy, it is worth the read."
3,series getting back on track,"This one was a good read. Like the previous reviewer I was concerned about unresolved plot lines, but not to twitch, the cover says it's volume #1 of a two part story, so hopefully they'll all resolve themselves in the next book. It was trying to end like a cliffhanger with the bad guy surviving. The usual final air battle seemed out of context, all of a sudden the air group is bombing Iraq (or is it Iran or is it both?) for no apparent reason. There could have been a smoother transition to the next book.There's a few editing errors like usual and once he talked about a backseater in an F-15 which would be unusual. I liked his definition of CIA in the glossary."
2,"Don't waste money, it isn't worth it","Okay, you may like it if you're a brainless 10-years-old white caucasian upperclassman. Otherwise no. All BSC books are dull but this one is the dullest. Like parents were going to give their kids to a bunch of 13-years-old. And the throwing up scene in the carousel. How thrilling"
4,HSDS - many versions,"For this story/movie there are many versions. The one I like the best isunder the same name but the Taiwan version 1983You can find the beginning of the movie on you tube.That's my favorite versionThis version is the second best.There's another one but, I don't think its as good.It stars Adam Cheng.Other than the 3 versions mention the rest of them suck! They over do the martial arts fighting by computer and outrageous flying, over doing the wire work looks cool but, when you over do it way too much it sucks!A better version of this movie is the one with Jet Li - Kung fu master."
1,Leappad product quality??,"We bought our first LeapPad and it did not work. As shipping charges would have cost us $80, it was cheaper to buy another one, than sending the first one back. Second one came with exactly the same problem - the page on the right side does not work, makes a clicking sound if you touch it with the pen. So we ordered a third one - the same story again. We tried all type of batteries, but to no avail. I would have liked to be able to use this toy to the advantage of my kids - especially if you read the other reviews - it must be magic. Only if you could get one that works."
1,Sounds too much like RAGE AGAINST THE MACHINE,"Listening to Wicked Wisdom's self-titled debut, its clear that frontwoman Jada Pinket Smith has talent as a singer. However, it's everything else about the band that isn't as talented. They sound too much like Rage Against The Machine, which wasn't a very good band to begin with. One thing the bothers me: when Jada sings about being in pain, are we really supposed to believe her? I mean, cmon, she's married to one of the highest paid actors in the world. Her words just seem false to me. I think the band would be alot better off if they'd just slow down the pace a little bit. I give it one star for effort. If there is another album, hopefully it will be more creative and original, but regardless, I won't be buying it. BOTTOM LINE: if you like Rage Against The Machine, then this is the album for you. If you don't like Rage, then don't waste your time, or money for that matter."
1,Very low quality wood,This bed arrived completely damaged--literally in pieces. Not hard to understand when you see the quality of the wood used--it's basically particle board. Not worth the time or money.
1,Big mistake,"I found out the hard way that this camera is not always compatable with Windows 98. The ""unload"" feature did not work well and when it finally started to perform the ""automatic unload"" to the computer, my system was blown. The system was totally crashed and had to be sent off for repair...hopefully they can repair it. During my website search at HP, I found that sometimes this camera has problems with Windows 98...so BEWARE!!"
3,Release for the sake of releasing...,"Excellent gift for someone who doesn't own any of Enya's albums, but I think they could have waited to release her couple new songs when she had an album's worth. You can't throw this one in with Watermark and Shepard Moon's in a multi-disc changer and throw it on shuffle, you will hear the same darn song twice in a row!"
1,Has never worked well in OS X,"Due to a spinal cord injury, my hands do not work. Obviously, typing is difficult, especially extended word processing. I use my computer 8-10 hours/day for work, email, etc., and frequently need to type more than a few lines. So, Viavoice seems to be the obvious choice for me. I have owned viavoice and each upgrade since the first version. Despite updates, this program has never worked well on OS X. On a few occasions I have gotten it to operate briefly, but usually it crashes, fails to open, does not respond, or dissappoints me in some other way.Training the program is a long process, and the fact that I cannot use it now is ridiculous. I consider myself a mac expert, and use many programs. I have never been more frustrated with a program than I am with this one. Support is poor, and updaters are few-and don't help.Save your money and more importantly your time-don't buy this program.."
5,Great Book,This is an excellent teaching resource for second person point of view. It is an excellent story and the children enjoy it!
5,An excellent addition to your library,"The recipes in this book are just different and offer a refreshing treat to mealtime.They are easy, produce is readily available and the preparation time is not excessive. You will enjoy the book and the food."
4,the funkiest house,"very underrated fusion band, Eleventh House had a shot but prolific lifetime.""Aspects"" is by far the funkiest record they've recordered.Although the production lacks of quality, just like ""introducing eleventh house"", this item is highly recommended for musicians and music lovers with good taste for music."
4,Funktastic,"Intense mid 70's jazz-rock-funk fusion from one of electric guitar's most prolific players serves up what was exciting in that era of adventurous hybrids. If the majority is steeped in somewhat dated production, Coryell provides some counterpoint to the obvious Headhunters-like vibe to keep things engaging."
1,Someones pathetic attempt to make a buck off the gullible,"This is nothing new. This is just repackaging of material made public elsewhere and freely available on the net. This material is what Aidan Kelly has been trying to pass off as a Gardnerian Book of Shadows for years. However, it is not a Gardnerian Book of Shadows. Such can only be obtained by authentic Gardnerian training and initiation. Don't buy what you can obtain online for free."
1,Waste of $$,I've seen this material on the web. It's certainly not worth buying. Some folks will print anything. It's all stuff that Kelly dreamed up years ago in his others books.
3,Frustrating,"Constantly crashes. When it does work, without crashing, it does well. Definitely need a good microphone."
2,Text book reading,"Although I haven't finished reading this book yet, the part I have completed is more of a textbook for background in counselling. If you are looking for a practical, nitty-gritty book to help with counselling, this book is not it."
4,Murdoch Mysteries Season 4,"Enjoyable, engaging series with interesting characters. Some episodes require more suspension of disbelief than others, but the mixture of mysterious murders with tongue-in-cheek dialogue is entertaining."
4,wonderful series,"I am throughly enjoying this canadian series. It is very creative,witty and full of action and has steam-punk - esque qualities that are very fun."
5,Love it !!!!!,"Love it!!!!!! The best TV show ever !!!!!! Murdoch Mysteries soooo fresh, sooo unique, soooo different... Watch it....give a try :-)"
1,waste of money for me,"Unfortunately these hooks do not fit all suspended ceilings and theydo not specify, in their write up, what width of track would be appropriatefor this product. I had to toss these as they would not fit on the ceilingtrack I needed them for. For a narrower track they would probably be fine."
3,Ok Book,A good book but there are better. if this is the only Vette book you will buy chose another book but if this will be part of your Vette library then it is an OK choice.Lacks details in many areas.
5,VR2940 works as advertised,"After reading all the poor reviews decided to try the VR2940.Have had great luck with GoVideo players and this one had thesame outcome. I immediately began copying all my old VHS tapesand now doing digital camcorder tapes to DVD's. Has workedperfectly and YesVideo is excellent! Dvd's have worked in allmy players, even in the car and boat!"
1,I agree don't buy it.,"It did work for awhile. Now it doesn't even power on.I expect a product less than 3 years old to last quitea bit onger before it completely dies. Into the trash itgoes. I'm not going to waste my time trying to fix it.Does anyone know what company made ""Go Video.""?I'm sure the pice of junk came from China or somewhereoverseas. My mistake for buying into it."
1,poor quality,"I bought this model several months ago for converting my home movies to dvds. It worked great for a while but then I noticed it freezing while playing commercial DVDs. Now it freezes constantly while playing any DVDs. I don't even bother trying to convert anymore of my home videos to DVDs. Basically, I ended up with a very expensive VCR."
1,Buy some other product!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This machine is simply horrible. I have had it two weeks. It constantly freezes up, and I then have to pull the plug from the AC outlet. The remote is very cheap and does not function well (when it functions at all). It has destroyed one of my prize VHS tapes. When you call support, you are on hold for 40 minutes.I WILL NEVER BUY ANOTHER ""GO VIDEO"" PRODUCT!!!!!!!!"
1,Beware! Does Not Convert VHS to DVD,"As I sit here waiting for Go-Video customer service to answer their phone (it's been 10 minutes so far), i have read the preceding customer responses and have to agree with them. I find that the unit intermittently freezes when converting VHS to DVD, thereby rendering the DVD useless. After transfering five hours of VHS tapes, this is extremely frustrating and not worth the price, if this is your reason for purchasing. The VCR and DVD Players are fine by themselves, but the transfer function is useless. You have to cross your fingers and toes and hope the unit doesn't freeze after several hours of transferring. Postscript: Well, they answered the phone and told me that because i purchased the unit over 90 days ago, i could exchange it for a new unit, but it will cost me shipping plus $89.95 for the new unit. Their recomendation, btw, was to buy dvd lens cleaner and try that. Judge for yourself!"
1,JUNK,"I'll cut right to the chase. The machine worked fine for about a year. Then for what ever reason, I could not get a picture on the screen. I have audio, but no picture. Tried diconnecting and reconnecting cables. Still no picture. After spending 3 hours with my head inside my enertainment cabinet, I disconnected this piece of junk.No wonder QVC does not sell this brand any more. Yup, thats where I got it. For now on, I'll go to the electronics store first and read reviews before I purchase a new one. Live and learn."
1,Don't buy,I like many others have been robbed by GoVideo's VR2940. I don't want to rehash all of the other negative comments but this product is a waste of money that does not work.
2,dissappointed in this machine,"This is the second DVD recorder that I have purchased and this one is giving me fits compared to the Go Video R6740. The main problem that I am encountering is that I set the timer, turn the machine off and leave. When I return, the timer did not function properly. It did not make a recording, however, it did go to the station on the tv to be recorded. Also, it does not turn on easily. I stand in front of the machine, and turn on the power and nothing happens. I try to turn it on from the remote -- nothing happens. The only thing which turns in on is to unplug the power and replug it back in. Of course, then I lose the time, the programs which were set to the timer (which doesn't work anyone). This is not a keeper!"
2,"Yikes, that was a lot of money for a lot of frustration","I also had trouble installing the software. Finally downloaded it (...). Then, once we got it working, the module ate up the batteries in less than 1/2 a day. When we take the module out, the visor has plenty of juice. But, when the module is plugged in, I og messages that I didn't have enough battery to take a picture. Very frustrating - and very expensive!"
4,An excellent piece of historical reading,"I'm just taking this from the inside flap of the book, which I think adequately represents a good review of the book:Drawn from the family archives in the quaint handwriting of these lovable ladies, Two Quaker Sisters presents the beautifully touching plain-spoken dramatic memoirs of two characters...Their lives are not alone a saga of a family, but a colorful, interpretive background of the early 19th century - that stormy part of it, the era of New England abolitionism, of militant Quakerism, and of living ""in the palm of God""."
1,QUALITY CONTROL PROBLEMS,Looks great but the case does not close completely over the Visor so the cover of the case keeps flipping open. I would not recommend it.
2,disappointed,"This was not what I expected from the item description. The case is very lightweight and flimsier than a good aluminum case should be. It does not offer any protection to the edges of my Visor Edge either, or to the stylus on the side, which concerns me. If I had paid the full $... or whatever the MSRP is on this case, I would be very upset; but I purchased it through a friend, and thank God I did because this case is not even worth the asking price. Bottom line: Don't waste your money on this case, it's not worth it."
4,Good Overall Bike,"Bought it directly from the store. Had talked to the specialist who was putting my bike together. He adjusted my handlebar so I would be sitting upright. Good bike overall. Love the shocks, the seat, the weight and the specs/techs that go with it. It's fun to ride again. The price is right."
1,No Support!,"I purchased this pillow hoping to get some ""neck' support but like most other pillows it failed. Back to getting my chiropractic/support/cervical pillows from Canada, as I have for the last 30 years."
4,Measuring the social impact of environmental decline,"This is probably the best researched book to date on how environmental destruction has affected society over the course of history. DeMeo shows with charts, maps and studies how we have systematically turned vast regions of the planet into desert wastelands. He then documents a disturbing pattern of cultural consequences for society across the world. DeMeo's decades of research help illuminate what is at stake for us in the struggle to heal the land.--author of The Gardens of Their Dreams: Desertification and Culture in World History"
3,Buen juego,"El juego es entretenido, no es de lo mejor pero clasifica dentro de mi escala de Bueno, algo muy interesante es el juego en linea ya sea ""vs"" o ""co-op""."
2,Boring War II: Wait till the Bargain Bin,"I was looking forward to this game for a while.. and i came away extremely disappointed. I was looking for some strategy or action, yet what i ended up finding was simply a rock-paper-scissors boring adventure. I finish the boring campaign in three days and tried the online mode which i found extremely boring as well.Overall, it may be worth 15-20 dollars. No more though. I traded it in for Super Mario Galaxy and i couldnt be happier with that."
2,Out of date and not enough detail on attractions.,"We purchased this based on recommendations, while it had some use it was pretty out of date. We stayed in Hopkins, half the restaurants weren't in the book. They had the locations of the mediterranean and pizza bar swapped around - this is an issue because they are several miles apart ! Ditto they say the realtor is at the wrong end of town. In terms of lack of detail for example they include attractions like Mayfower falls, but they don't say it's an aggressive hike requiring good shoes and being physically fit.I give it 2 stars because they did get some places right like Taste of India in Hopkins being a great for a low cost curry."
4,A Very Readable Overview of Bible History & Geography,"I have assigned Laney's CONCISE BIBLE ATLAS for a couple of semesters now as the text for the college class I teach on Bible History and Geography. Other bible atlases contain more appealing maps, but Laney's book shines in its written text. Each of the sixteen chapters describes a period of history, from the primeval period to the present, from the perspective of the biblical record and the lands involved. Geographical features are highlighted for each historical period. I recommend the book for anyone looking for an historical survey of the biblical period and the lands involved. And with only 261 pages, the book is not a lengthy read."
3,Quaint,"Quaint. I felt like I was reading a long National Geographic magazine article bound in a hardcover. The author's ""cute"" family conversations and experiences do little to make the book more interesting. The beautiful illustrations help to redeem the shortfalls."
4,Very informative,This book is very informative as well as historically interesting. The information was well researched and well presented. Of course I'm a bit biased since I am a graduate of the college for which it is named. For those who are interested in the family and history behind this wonderful school it's a must read.
3,Middle of The Road......,"Well to start I have been a fan for as long as they put out albums. This album is middle of the road it doesn't grab you like ""Picture Book"" or ""Stars"" but it isn't without appeal. This album like another reviewer said grows on you. Different to be sure but still good and extremely better than most pop music played here in the States. Maybe Mick is missing a ""Band"" people to bounce off of and get ideas from like on earlier albums. Yes he has and continues to be the focus but having a band to put their touches on this maybe what's missing. To sum up a good album but not there best."
2,incredibly average,"The latest simply red cd unfortunately is so derivative, it's boring. The songs are predictable and the lyrics are rather innane ('the sky is a gypsy- in what way?). Don't waste your time and effort on this one..it's just not worth it...i exchanged my copy and would advise others to do the same."
3,Not a patch on Blue,"I know others will disagree with me but I think that Blue and Stars were excellent.Love in the Russian Winter really just does not do it for me. I've given it a fair try, liked the second track, but it really does not have the tracks that make me say, 'wow that's so true of life' or 'hey that's just how I feel today'.The catchiness of tracks like ""Fairground"" are missing, so are the slushy numbers like ""If you don't know me by now"".I'll keep listening and hope for that spark that warmness that Simply Red comes to me"
3,works well for what they are,"The Pyle 6x9's sound good for being Pyle's lower line. They're a good, inexpensive way to upgrade your blown factory speakers. I wouldn't try to push them but they work well on a head unit or small amp."
1,Facilities Director,These signs are of defective quality. Recently purchsed them. Two of the three are broken. Plastic cracks/breaks where the top portion incerts into the bottom.
5,Lemon Tree Provides Hope for the Future,"Tolan provides seeds for hope to the seemingly endless fighting between Palestinians and Isralis today. Dalia's family history is full of courage for a displaced people. Bashir's family story is ripe with cultural relevance and beauty. These two wonderful people demonstrate the richness and toil of their peoples. Yet, together they find the commitment and determination to render some hope for the future in the troubled land they share. A beautiful story drawn with genuine strengh and tenderness.A wonderful read!"
2,Emotional and uneven,"This is a simple minded narrative of the middle east history. The Arabs are consistently protrayed as helpless victims of Israeli agression. It glosses over Arab atrocities. Three examples, the 1947 war of independence, is seen as an opportunity for an Israeli land grab. No mention of the Arab attacks on Israeli population. Secondly, the Jewish efforts to drain the swamps and reclaim the land, is similarly seen as part of the drive to increase the Jewish population at the expense of the Arabs. Third example, as cited from another reviewer, there is no discussion of the expulsion of Jews from Arab countries. Guess it's not worthy of objection.The author has a simple minded view of a long term historical, involving many peoples with competing interests, and forces it into his ideological blinders."
2,Another Palestinian apologist,"this author has to work for New York Times. Never in my life have I read such a one sided account of history. Every horrid atrocity committed by Arabs is given little attention while every attempt by Israel to protect itself is treated as the actions of a warmongering country. The author uses two entire paragraphs to detail the inhuman horrors committed by Arabs and the rest of the book is about the evils of Jews and Zionists. He glosses over the slaughter of Jewish athletes in Munich in one sentence and then says it may have not been sanctioned by Palestinians. This book is a joke.We are where we are. The author should be attacking the UN and Truman for letting the Zionists create a religious state and then not enforcing the rules. There is absolutely no mention in the book of the Israel side of anything. Amazing!I feel like I just read the Sunday Times,well written, but 96% propaganda."
