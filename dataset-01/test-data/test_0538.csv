5,Excellent travel case for fencers!,"My daughter is a competitive fencer, and I purchased the SKB 2SKB-4812WS ATA Standard Golf Travel Case for her first European Cadet Circuit tournament in Grenoble, France this past weekend. This case did an excellent job in protecting all her 4 epees, mask, body cords and uniform. The fact that it was waterproof came in handy as well, since we had to carry it in the rain. My only complain is that it is 2"" too long for fencers, and it is hard to fit in many medium size car trunks."
2,not thrilled,First time used the gorillas at Alaska Airlines or our beloved TSA broke the side handle. For the price of the bag I'm not impressed with the quality of the handle as one should be able to lift the full bag by the handle and not have it break!
1,Do not use - This worsens Stye,"I bought this because I thought it would help lessen the pain associated with a stye however this product made it worst. If you look at the ingredients, white petrolatum which is in fact petroleum jelly. This actually holds in the germs instead of letting it pass out.I went to the doctor and now on antibiotics amoxicillin pot clavulanate 500mg and have eye drops called ocuflox."
2,Overall a disappointment,"It works well on hardwood floors but is a real disappointment on carpet. My house has mostly hardwood floors and a few oriental rugs. It does well on the hardwood but on the carpets it is very hard to push at a low vacuum setting and impossible at a high setting.The attachments are awkward to use since there is no flexible hose. To clean the windowsills, you have to pickup the entire vacuum and run it over the windowsill. I used to use the narrow edge attachment to clean the coils at the bottom of my fridge and now this is even more awkward than cleaning the windowsills.As one other poster observed, the vacuum bags are small.In summary, if have a small house with all hardwood floors, this is probably a pretty good product. If not, I would look some where else."
2,Good features. Poor quality for price,"The features are great: emailing, pan and tilt, wireless, zooming, etc.However, the image quality is probably one of the poorest image qualities i have ever seen with a camera that cost well over $400. Luckily, this was bought with company money and not my own. If i bought it personally, i would be pissed off."
3,Nostalgia,"I have a set of this cookware and was interested about how it is supposed to be used, they are about 40 years old but good quality doesn't die. Luckily I was able to find an original book on Amazon, great!"
2,Wish I could return it...,This is not a dvd to help master the dance. It is only this dancer's change-up of different moves. Very disappointing. Don't know what the time frame is for returning it but I would like to return it. Don't waste your time buying this one.
2,The Manx Norton a review,Excessive focus on personalities and too little technical detail on the tuning and mechanical development of the motor. Little information of such essentials as specfic horsepower/torque figures of engines showing the increases and dates of important engineering milestones from early to late.
4,Does the job well and good value,"I bought these straw brushes to clean my daughter's straw sippy cups. They work like a charm and are at a great price. Though the wire handle may seem relatively thin, it is thick enough to do the job. Overall, good value."
4,It does its job.,It cleans my bottle nipples and my straw for sippy cup really great. At first I thought it was a little too small/thin but it works great for cleaning what I need to clean with it.
4,Made of the product,These little brushes are specifically made for the product. When the bottles are purchased it comes with one brush but then you have to buy more brushes once that one little brush comes to the end of its life after so many uses. They do not live long is definitely a con.... But you must keep every part of the bottl clean. My son is 1 years old now and I have been using Dr. Browns bottles since he was born.
3,I thought they were flimsy....,"Not what I was looking for. My wife and I wanted something to clean our kid's straws. I saw some lady on amazon mention these as a good option so we picked up a set. I was very disappointed in the quality. I know this was not its intended use and its only a few bucks but I still wish it was a little more sturdy. Anyway, I found something else that I'm a lot happier with. If you want something for your straws get the Sippy Stuff straw brush. If you don't mind switching brushes every now and then get these. They come four in a pack."
5,Love the brushes,"It has been a journey in finding straw brushes. I never knew that there were straw brushes at all. Tried to look for them at a regular grocery store, but did not have any luck until I looked it up here. It is great."
5,Clean,These clean very well. I used it to clean out my tumbler straws and it helped to get the soap in and out.
5,Hilarious Sophisticated Guide to Getting Laid!,"There is only one word for this book-- HILARIOUS! There is also another one--mysoginist. The author makes Patrick Bateman look like a feminist!I especially liked the ""Definition of eternity"" (the time between your coming and her going); the chapter ""If She Won't Take her Clothes off, Take Yours Off"" and ""Never tell a Woman You Love Her Even If you Don't""""Shagging on the Cheap"" and ""Everything is Deniable"" were also very funny.Buy the book but don""t let your girlfriend see it. She'll kill you!"
3,Disappointed,"Emjoi AP-10L Light Caress, CordedI have used the Emjoi AP99 Optima for years. The last time I ordered a hair remover I purchased the AP-10L. I was very disappointed in it compared to the AP99 Optima by Emjoi. The AP-10L does not remove hair from legs or underarms nearly as well as it should in my opinion."
5,Won't go back to razors,"This is my second Emjoi, as I had the first for several years and just plain wore it out. This model with it's massaging finger is even more comfortable, although I did not have discomfort with my original after a couple of uses. It is quick, painless and leaves my legs smooth for several weeks! I have recommended this to my sisters and they love it too."
2,Boring!,"This book reads like a lecture, and no wonder--Wagstaffe teaches a university speech class. The text brings back the horrors of the most soporific lectures you've endured in school, as Wagstaffe drones on about the ""three Ms of good storytelling"" (""It must be meaningful. It must be memorable. It must be moving."") and then moves on into the even more enthralling ""ABCs of good storytelling"" (""A for Apt, B for Brief, C for Chronological"").Then there are unintentional howlers, like this advice on giving a eulogy: ""The fundamental rule...Do not speak ill of the dead."" Well, duh!Maybe this stuff works when you've got a captive audience of students who need a good grade to satisfy the requirements for their degree. But here in the real world, it'll put most people to sleep. I feel that the money I spent on this book was wasted."
5,Wagstaffe is a Public Speaking Genius,I read this book once and then again because I thought it was so fabulous and intriguing. I have never been a very good public speaker. It was my biggest fear until I discovered this outstandingly written book. I have improved my public speaking tremendously. I feel like a new person. I hope to see more books by this fabulous author. I was so thankful for my new found ability for public speaking that I just had to write a thank you note to James Wagstaffe.
5,not bad,for the price i got this for it was really good i just wanted soem thing ot carry my guns to adn from range this fits the bill and got it right away
2,YOU GET WHAT U PAY FOR,THIS CASE IS OK BUT THE LOCKING CLIPS ARE PLASTIC AND CAN BE POPPED OF EVEN WHEN CASE IS LOCKED USING PAD LOCKS.
4,plano not a bad deal,"When I received the plano protector series I was very satisfied with the way the product looked, and its multiple uses. I would recommend this product to anyone who is looking for some way to bring rifles or shotguns to the range, hunting, or whatever it will keep your guns secure during any transportation. I would not suggest for flying. I place it in the truck and am worry free of damage to my guns. It definetly stores 2 rifles/shotguns very nicely. I store my guns in there always. I would suggest some silica packs placed in the case for storage, seems to eliminate all moisture."
4,not to bad,its a nice product little bit small for my taste i have an ar 15 and a ruger 22 rifle with two clips an 600 rounds of ammo but they fit tightly in. the case with the guns in it is kinda heavy but its basicly used for a safe as of now works good
4,Plano Single Scoped or Double Non-Scoped Rifle Case,"This case is better than a soft case but still a little thin and flimsy.For the price is is not a bad case. If you have a collectable or an expensive riffle, buy a better case with metal latches and is lockable."
4,I'd buy it again.,"It's worth the $30 to protect my gun in transport in my vehicle to/from locations.Not super well made, but adequate."
3,"Pretty good, but...","This book has quite a bit of good information, but it has too much of the ""do it my way or you're not a professional"" attitude throughout."
5,Very Satisfied,"The Jersey we purchased was exactly what we were looking for. The quality is up to standards, and just the right size.Thanks so much.Donny"
1,Pass on this one,"I know nothing of PHP, but know quite a bit of HTML. I thought this book would have much by the way of examples so I could learn PHP. But, I found this book to be hard to crack, since there are hardly any examples to follow (never could understand why the book was titled PHP BY EXAMPLE). And what examples there are, assume that you are an experienced programmer. I fell apart after the first chapter but gave it my best shot to understand the author's poor writting and explainations. I can't wait to sell this book to my nearest Half Price Bookstores. This was a real waste of my money!"
2,"PHP by Example, Good for those with a basic website.","PHP By Example is a good book for those wanting to learn the basics about website creating through PHP. I make virtual games like ...and was looking for a good book unfortunatly if your intermediant or a expert this book wont be as helpful to you.Its a good book but think a few times if you really want it, i brought it then didnt need it the next day?!? Whats that saying?"
5,The Best Accapella Group In History!!,I have been a fan of this group since the early 90's. They are AWESOME! Great live and great in the studio! I guarentee you will not be disappointed with this CD. The BEST! Move over Take 6! These boys can hold their own!
2,Pamela Judy,I love Kat Martin - I own all of her novels.BUT I could not even finish the Handmaiden's Necklace.
5,Disavowed,Sam Morton is one of the best writers that I have had the honor to read in a long time. He has a wonderful story with great stamina. He is a must read. I am axiously waiting the next book by Sam Morton.
3,You must be kidding!!!,"The xtra's were ok! The Rock vs. Jericho from RAW! Undertaker vs. Angle & Austin on Smackdown! Here is my rating for the matches!Edge vs. Christian in a cage match= ** 1/2! They needed to show more of the finishers!Scotty 2 Hotty vs. Hurricane Helms= *! I hate how Rookie's try to make a good match!Big Show vs. DDP= **! The Match was way too fast! I guess when they planned it, it was last minute!Hardyz vs. Dudleyz vs. APA = ***! The match would of been better if they would change the match type! It would be awesome in a cage match!Regal vs. Tajiri= ** 3/4! It was just typical! You knew that Tajiri was not going to win!Diva Tag Match= ****! The Diva's made the best effort to make it an awesome match!Rock vs. Austin= ***! It was kind of dull! The Rock and Austin just tried to do the same routine as Wrestlemania X7!Overall= Last years was the best Rebellion ppv, ever!"
5,Powerful drill - small package,The drill was described in the add as a compact drill. When it arrived I was surprised as to how small it was and right away I assumed its performance to be light weight as well. The drill can do almost every task my 14.4 Milwaukee performs. Surprising power and it also holds a charge very well. Now I find myself reaching for the Panasonic drill because it is so light and compact. Really a great product - I should buy another.
2,Hi maintenance,"I researched and considered specs and reviews from everywhere before deciding on this mat. In my opinion, move on. Although it's heavier than I imagined, I could live. It's hard, not as plush as I'd hoped. But the smell was noxious! I washed it, aired it outside for several days, washed it again, aired again. After a week of that, I took it to class, still smelled it when I lay on it; but then, I realized I was wet! Apparently it absorbed water though the surface had been dry to touch, as pressing down caused sweating. Then my feet were slipping on it! Not a good yoga move. So I put a blanket on top to finish out the class.One has to wrap it in towels after rinsing or wiping it which is a hassle. It's too tough to squeeze and rinse, of course.Next class, I borrowed a mat that was cushy and had more give under hands and feet, lighter, prettier, and smell-free. Whatever it is, I'm going to get one."
5,Great waffle iron,"I've used this waffle iron almost weekly since I got it. Still works great. I find if you use a non-stick spray, the waffles come right out. Cook perfectly every time. Super!"
5,Yummy!,"I have not owned a new modern waffle maker before. Many years ago my Mom gave me her vintage 1945 one and what a mess that thing made, so I never thought about buying one.A friend of mine wanted one and I decided to buy her this one for a Christmas gift and decided to buy myself one as well. :)Can we say EASY? The first waffle I made was PERFECT and was so yummy. I use it several times a week now and don't know how I lived without it. I'll never make another pancake again.I can't rate the recipes that come with it, I use a mix that I buy in the grocery store and sometimes toss in some vanilla, or cinnamon or some pecans, and they all come out perfectly! I use the spray Pam every other use and it works perfectly.I highly recommend this if you want to make perfect waffles and not spend a fortune!"
3,"good waffles, but annoying sounds","The waffle making is great. Many other reviews make that clear, so no need to say more.However, the sound is horrible. It's a very loud high-pitched sound. Our dog trembles terrified whenever we make waffles. Would be 5* if the sound could be turned off."
1,NO STARS IF THIS WAS A CHOICE,"This item arrived VERY POORLY PACKAGED. There was almost no protection for these sandstone coasters and one half of the box was smashed. Consequently, the coasters were chipped on all of the sides. Additionally, the item IS NOT as pictured. The background is NOT a plain tan color as shown in the picture. It actually looks as if it has been stamped with many tiny purple leaves. I would not purchase this product again. Amazon has said they will provide a refund."
2,Not the worst thing,The book is okay. I am a little disappointed since there was so much hype around this item. There is nothing particularly special that this book has that a generic baby heirloom does not. Nothing really specifically special regarding adoption anyway.
3,Haven't used it yet.,"This backpack appears to be of ok quality. I haven't used it yet, but one of the plastic zipper tips came off. I was able to make a repair, but I hope this isn't a sign of problems when it is put to use."
5,Very High Quality 'Easy Listening',"This is the second of Chandos 'The Grainger Edition' recordings I have reviewed and it is much closer to the heart of my tastes than the piano accompanied baritone solos of Volume 2 I previously reviewed. Just as I will value a cookbook if it has just one extraordinary recipe or a computer book if it has just one extraordinarily good programming idea, I wouldlove this album even if everything else but 'Scotch Strathspey and Reel' were junk. But, of course, all the other tracks on the album are not junk, they are very, very good. Just not as enjoyable as this superb rendition of the famous sea chanty, better known by its first line 'What do we do with a drunken sailor...' The 'Joyful Company of Singers' earns their name on this one. Next to Russian liturgical choral singing, sea chanties are my favorite, so I confess to being just a bit less than impartial on this one, but there you are. This one is simply lovely."
5,Very happy,"I bought this book expecting an easy-to-follow format. And it met all of my expectations and more. I plan to use this curriculum at each grade level until my kids graduate. I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to better their skills in Language Arts, and Literature. Have a great day!"
4,Colorful comedy,First saw Zazie years ago and remembered I'd loved it. So I was thrilled to see that it was coming out in a Criterion release. The film was as crazy and colorful as I remember it. All potty-mouthed Zazie wants to do while visiting her uncle in Paris is to ride the metro. Unfortunately it's closed due to a worker's strike. Still there are plenty of other adventures to be had and lots of colorful characters to have them with. Zazie is a real gem and I highly recommend it. The Criterion DVD is what one expects: outstanding and with great extras.
3,No Mercy 1999!!!,Austin vs Triple H!! Great Main Event!! Good PPV!! but they could've left out the Mideon-Godfather and the Rock-Bulldog matches for Raw.
2,Better live than on record,"These guys have always been amazing live...well, when they are good, they are outstanding. I have seen these guys since they were a duo alternating between drums and guitar/vocals in 1995. I personally never saw a mediocre show by them. They have a pretty intense presence on stage...and may just destroy some property at the venue they are performing at. Conrad and Jason are nuts.For some reason, however, I dont think these guys record good albums. I have yet to hear the new Mistakes and Regrets (and have heard it is quite good) but Madonna and their debut Lp both left me wanting alot more. The Madonna lp sounds like Fugazi (Guy P. sounding vocals) or Blond Redhead or Sonic Youth, and not very much like Trail of Dead. They have a sound all their own too and I hope they learn how to capture it on album. Go see these guys live or get ahold of a live recording!"
1,Hogwash!,"Well, trail of Bread breaks out into the open with this one, a half-step away from MTV stardom. From the cliched song titles (perfect Teenhood? c'mon) to the crappy photoshop album cover, this emo band hits rock bottom at every turn. Eth music sounds like a less catchy Smashing Pumpkins (not a compliment!),and Sonic Youth should be able to sue these Texans, if Unwound does not beat them to it. oh, how these white boys have so much angst! I guess their fans just wish they could be as cool as the bands they worship. Did I already mention MTV?"
1,Not worth it...,"I was looking for this antenna because no one sells Toyota (Celica/Paseo) antennas anymore. And, factory direct ones are waaaaay overpriced! I found this antenna by this seller for around $13 dollars. I had waited for a couple of months, and when I looked agin the price was the same--the ""only ( ) left"" is always there on the page--so I purchased it. Then three days later I get an email that they are out of the antennas so my order is cancelled, but I can re-order and the price is now more than $18 dollars! WTH?!! This is really lame, and I will never order from this vendor, period! It is really bad business and really aggravating when vendors have products just sitting and waiting until someone is interested (most products have very few buyers), then make up excuses about why the order can't go through--only to change the price because NOW someone is interested. Really scummy."
5,Great Idea!,"I love watching my puppy kick this around the floor trying to get the cookies out, great entertainment for him and myself. Anything that makes my puppy happy is worth it =)"
2,My bulldog destroyed it in a week,"We have an English Bulldog and I have been struggling to find something he cannot destroy within a few days. This toy was destroyed within a week. Not to say it is a bad toy, it is probably good for a less aggressive chewer."
3,Durable but not as expected,"This ball is the typical Kong tough rubber, which is great. My dog has been chewing on it quite a bit and it hasn't ripped or torn yet. However, there are four bone-shaped holes in the ball, and one of them is significantly larger than the others. Every treat I've put inside the ball comes out of that hole almost instantly. I was hoping this would be more like the Kong, where I could put a treat in it and keep my dog entertained for a while trying to get it out, but that's not the case. Still an ok purchase though for a tough ball that he can chew and not destroy."
5,Bright and comfy,My daughter loves it. It is brighter than the picture shown and comfortable. As everyone warned the pillow is no use. You cannot really use it. It is too small and hard. But other than that...nice !!
1,0 stars would be more accurate,"Very poor connection to phone -- the contact pins are junk. Forget this one unless you never drive the car when the phone is charging, or never want to talk on the phone when it's charging. If the phone jiggles at all, the poor connection causes the phone to re-boot, stop charging, and other nonsense."
2,Lucas has done it again!,"Having hated the prequel movies, I was pleasantly surprised to find myself loving season one & two of the Clone Wars animated series. Of course I bpught season three when it first came out. The quality of the writing is atrocious. Hardly any Anakin or Kenobi in the first half of the season. Katie Lucas may be a relative but that doesnt make her a writer....this series has been made into something I can definately wait to see....only a handful of episodes well written for the season..not up to par"
2,"Great season, but package fails compared to Season 1+2!!! :(","Honestly, there should be 2 ratings for every product when it comes to movies.-For the Clone Wars season 3 - I'd rate it a 4-5 stars-For the actual packaging? 2 stars is almost too much.I purchased this thinking that I would get the same great package that I got with the 1st 2 season.Sadly, I was sorely disappointed today when it arrived...and was in a normal Bluray jewel case.Lucasfilm this is quite possibly the biggest disappointment I've had with any of you products in my lifetime. Whoever at your company that decided to sell this without the same package deal that the 1st 2 seasons had should be demoted or let go. I'd go as far as to say that not having the deluxe packaging option the 1st 2 had is inexcusable.As far as the season goes, EXCELLENT and it only gets better.Please, LucasFilm (and now Disney) - PLEASE bring back the better packages like Seasons 1 and 2!!! :("
4,"I liked it, overall.","I enjoy watching this series. Granted, a few of the episodes get a little hokey, but overall, I give it a thumbs up.And I really do not mind that the discs come in a regular dvd case without the little booklet."
2,Not the book format...disappointed.,"I pre-ordered this season as soon as possible as my sons and I love watching the cartoons together. Received it today, on the day of release, yay! Season 3 is fantastic; I have no complaints about the episodes. My disappointment stems from the case. As noted by another reviewer, this is not the book format as the first 2 seasons of blu-rays are. So besides the fact that the products now do not match (which I'm sorry is very important to me), I've paid the high cost for nothing extra, no notes or drawings, the things that made the other blu-rays special."
5,Great show,"This is a great show and good entertainment, but you know that if you are looking to buy the 3rd season on Blu-ray. Packaging is good and sturdy and arrived in a timely manner."
3,Agree with others,I agree with the other posters the season was great but they should have done the packaging the same as the first 2 seasons.
4,Hydroponic Food production,"I found this book to be excellently written with informative, down to earth material, photo's and illustrations of most of the newer hydroponic systems that are now being used in commercial applications.I got the impression that the author has a lot of background experience and knows the hydroponic field very well."
4,Smoochy,"My son became very attached to this toy in his pre-school classroom. When he ripped the eyes out, I purchased a replacement for the classroom and one for home. Within 2 days, he ripped out an eye in the new frog. If you have a child who is tough on toys, just watch the eyes."
1,Beware - this film does not feature Adam Garcia,For some reason this film comes up when you do a search on the Australian actor Adam Garcia. Please don't buy this film thinking he is in it because he isn't.
2,english???,"I agree with the majority of the opinions expressed here so no need to go into detail - the English narration for La Jetee does a serious disservice to this remarkable film. I have done a fair bit of research to determine a source for the claim that Marker 'prefers' this version but cannot find verification and therefore choose to disbelieve it. I have a fuzzy old version on VHS of the original French version and it is by far preferable. Also the English version suffers seriously in some places from a different mix balance between the narration and the music/sfx - very noticeable at the climactic final scene at the airport - in the French one has a tremendous emotional response to the story's conclusion partly because of the soaring music and screaming jet engines, in the English both music and effects are mixed far lower under narration resulting in a very muted concusion. HUGE DISAPOINTMENT ALL ROUND."
5,FANTASTIC!!!,"This item exceeded my expectations. The material is a lot thicker than expected, logo was larger...overall wonderful!! Highly recommend to others!"
1,Was only good for 2 weeks,I bought this product without looking at the reviews. I used it for 2 weeks and it didn't work any more. The rice sticks to the bottom and you have to keep putting water on it. Bad product....
4,Good product,I don't know why anyone is having trouble with this. It makes perfect rice. Nothing gets burned. It's perfect every time.
2,Did not work for us,We have been using it for six months. It burns the rice and has not really been useful.
5,BEST YOUNG COMIC=Birbiglia,"Mike Birbiglia is hands down the most talented young stand up out there today. He's as creative as Dave Chapelle, as insightful as Jerry Seinfeld and his thoughtful wit should draw comparisons to a young Mark Twain. If you want to hear the next big star in comedy then buy this C.D. Mike is technically perfect, from a comedian's perspective, with his skillful delivery and properly placed call backs. I guarantee that you'll enjoy Mike's unique and refreshing view on everything from hip hop to donuts to funerals."
3,"Only OK, ""Loving God with all your mind"" is a much better choice","This book is only OK. This author did not give facts to support her oppinions, just stated them as fact. Also did not give practical ways to apply what she says. I have also readLoving God with All Your Mindwhich I think is a much better choice as it is much more applicable and the author backs up what she is saying with scripture. If I had not been reading this book with several women as a study, I would not have finished it."
3,Making the most of your flex shaft,"It's useful, to be sure, but, to be honest, I was expecting to find more tips I did not already know about making the most of my flex shaft. However, information about flexshaft maintenance and other information about various abrasives is more than a little useful to have on hand and easy to find. Karen cannot be faulted for the clarity of her layout and writing; it is so easy to follow and certainly I recommend it to anyone who is not familiar with a flexshaft."
4,Not the best starting point for Grainger,"This collection of Percy Grainger's 'Orchestral Works' does not include those things for which Grainger is best known. And, it does not include those things of which I am most fond, which are mostly his choral and solo voice works. But then, I may not have gotten to listen to this very nice material. Like all of Grainger's work, this is far more accurately described as nice or pretty than 'beautiful' or 'sublime'. But it has its moments, and there are phrases here and there which really make me stop and take notice. So, it's good to give this a listen before you move on to 'Danny Boy' and the like."
4,Solid sound-a great HTIB value!,"After consideration of what I wanted in a Home Theater system, I took the chance on this unit through Amazon for $450. I was a bit tentative due to the lack of connectivity options that this unit offers but as it turns out, this set up offers me all I really need. I liked the option of recording to DVD in addition to the HDMI connectivity which drastically improves picture quality. The sound this system produces is excellent for movies, sports, and general television viewing. If you are looking to blow out your neighbors windows though, you'd be better served to purchase a componant system....albeit for much more money. One tip to purchasers is to be prepared to purchase a roll or two of 16 gauge wire to connect the speakers. The included wires are, for lack of a better word, WORTHLESS. This is the only reason I was not able to give this HTIB a 5-star rating. Otherwise, for the money, you can't go wrong."
1,not in english :(,"They didn't make these movies available in English at all!How sad, I was really looking forward to seeing cardcaptors,but not in another language, I guess I won't be buying this after-all."
2,"No incentive, just a collection of words copied.","There was no insight into this book. All they did was look at the poems already written, and take out the last words."
1,Wrong item advertized,Beware if you buy this item from Goodman. They will send you the 5-piece serving set and not the hostess set as listed and described. You will notice that the 2 images shown are not the same! I don't know why they don't correct this mistake. They sent me a refund but never explained the mistake.
1,Another god book in disguise,Too many mentions of god. Not much self-help if it's always god's responsibility instead of our own.
5,Putt Like a Pro,"Why attempt to putt differently than the way you make a full swing--around, not straight back and through. Learn from the guru and watch your handicap fall."
1,Bad...bad in everyway,I would have to say this is one of the biggest low points in X-Men history.....The Draco story should never have been done....bad writing....bad storyline...bad art....avoid this story
2,No new stories just basic Gundamit but you need it,"There were basically no new Episodes on this disc. There were just recaps of what happened on 3 episodes. The other 2 episodes are building up for what will come.... And it's going to be big. I gave it 2 stars cause it's nothing new, just reruns; however you definately need this disc for your Gundam Wing Collection!"
1,Terrible,I ordered this item A MONTH AGO and have yet to receive it. Thanks to the poor delivery I am now currently failing this class. Thanks amazon!
5,Great!,"I was looking for a yellow umbrella to use as a prop when my fiancé and I took our engagement pictures - I wanted one like the ""mother"" has in How I Met Your Mother. This worked perfectly!!"
1,Too small for an adult!,"I ordered a yellow umbrella as pictured, but the one I received was greenish-yellow (except for the handle). I used it for the first time last week and somewhere between the morning and the afternoon one of the small screws that holds one of the joints together (which was supposed to be permanently fastened on the underside of the umbrella) came off. Unfortunately, I missed the return period by a few days so this brand, new umbrella will just end up in the trash. Oh, well. By the way, it's an American company, but the umbrella is made in China."
4,It didn't break...,"I live in windy Boston, and have put to rest a great number of folding umbrellas. I have used this through a few windy days now and it has held up well. Its light and seems to not be heavily built, but engineered well. The edges give in the wind instead of breaking, and the long center braces though light but appears stronger than most compact umbrellas. With a little care in the very heavy gusts we can get on downtown streets this appears to be a winner."
2,"Umbrella fine, picture not fine","The picture of this umbrella is solid orange but we received an Orange and White Umbrella. It was a gift to my teenager daughter who loves orange and is happy with receiving one with orange in it but I am not happy with ordering a solid orange umbrella and receiving a striped one. Otherwise, it is a normal umbrella that opens easily."
1,Worthless,"Defective once open. Will you pay USD 9.69 for an umbrella that you, can barely use for one day only ?"
5,Very helpful product,I have moderate to severe astigmatism in one eye and getting the gas permeable lens out is very difficult manually. This product works quickly to remove my lenses and I keep several around. The company I purchased from provided the lens inserters quickly and product arrived well packaged.
2,Predictable story with too many stereotypes,"The story is an interesting concept, and I had high hopes for a strong historical drama. However, the characters and plot lines are predictable, as if Fergus wrote this in a very lazy manner. There isn't any hint of real creativity, and many of the characters are stereotypes and are not explored beyond the superficial. I found myself wanting certain scenes to go in a different direction, like asking Fergus to put some effort into his writing! The story reads quickly, but other than that, I was disappointed."
3,Not quite what I expected,"Although I felt this was a wonderful story and very intruiging, I was a bit put off by the language and what I felt to be un-necessary descriptions of the 'relations' between the white brides and their husbands. I felt that it was condescending to the reader to place so much emphasis on those aspects of the story. Otherwise, a great adventure.. I read it in a day!"
4,Truly wonderful.,"""One Thousand White Women: The Journals of May Dodd: A Novel"" is a very emotional book! I had no idea that the main idea off trading one thousand white women for one thousand horses had even occurred, so that was interesting in itself. Reading about what it might have been like if this transaction had actually occurred was even more mind-blowing. It's rather clear that this isn't an actual diary from the standpoint of the amount of written dialogue in the entries. Otherwise, it could have been real - that is how natural author Jim Fergus wrote this book. The ending is very emotional, and this has become a new favorite. I recommend."
4,Engrossing,"May Dodd signs up for this ""experiment"" in order to escape her illegal imprisonment in an insane assylum. Although she is glad to be out of the assylum, she does have anxious moments before she is left to the ""savages"" and on her own. After she has been with these ""savages"" for a while, she realizes they are really much more civilized than the white men she left.She becomes more compassionate towards the Indians, more unforgiving towards the white men who try to bully the Indians to submit to the white man's world and ways.To see this change in May, to understand it through her journals, is fascinating. Loved the book!"
1,"Egregiously, Absurdly Bad Book","You ladies out there, pay attention: this is what gives ""books for women"" a bad name! I don't have the stamina to go into this book's manifold idiocies (it was assigned by my bookclub; never even heard of it before that). Just please read some of the other one star reviews and have more self-respect than to stoop to read this absurdity."
3,"Great premise, cliched writing","Upon a strong recommendation of a friend of mine, I read this book. The premise is terrific and the story kept me engaged throughout - the writing was fine, in that the images were vivid and the pacing quick and entertaining. If only the author could craft characters with a bit of complexity and depth! The racist Southerner (who realizes the errors of her ways), the proud and strong Black Woman, the noble but conflicted passionate Captain - how much more cliche can you get? This book also confirmed to me why men should not write love scenes - I rolled my eyes at nearly every passionate embrace. But, if you're looking for entertainment and not mind-expanding literature, it would be great book for the beach!"
3,Not in good condition,"Bottom 1/3 edge of book warped as if water spilled on it & left to dry, this affects whole book, therefore it doesn't lay flat & somewhat cumbersome to hold."
4,Surprised to enjoy so much,Never thought I would like a book about the wild west and Indians....really learned a lot and enjoyed the story.
3,"O.K. read, but not a favorite","The story had a certain charm, but for me seemed too ""contrived"" to make a strong impact on my consciousness. I wonder if it had to do with a man (the author) having attempted to create a woman's story that was at the root of so many elements that just didn't ""ring true"". I'd hesitate to give my time to anything else by this author."
1,How did this book manage to get in print!,"If I could rate this below one star I would. This book covered every stereotype possible: the boozy, trashy, red-headed Irish twins; the big, homely, muscular, Swede; the racist, phony, southern belle; the filthy, rotted-tooth little Frenchman, etc. Of course, the heroine is ""chosen"" by the most well-respected and good looking brave. The author made sure there was a mate for every one of his characters, there even ""happened"" to be one Black brave to be paired with the regal, non-conformist, former slave woman.The premise to this novel is original but everything else was so cliche' it was embarrassing.The only part of the book the author seemed to put any effort into were the elaborate, porn-like, sex encounters. I'm no prude but these scenes were thrown in helter-skelter and added nothing to the story line what-so-ever.Don't waste your money or your time on this book."
4,Page Turner,"This book definately had my complete attention. I just needed to read more and more and more.I enjoyed May Dodd's narrative voice through out the story. And I did feel Jim Fergus depicted the woman's point of view well. Yet, I found her and the other women she embarks on the journey with a bit hard to believe. At times, I thought the women were more like women of the present rather than women of the late 1800s. There were many times the women would say and do things that were just far fetched to me. That is why I do give it a 4 rather than a 5 star rating.The history intrigued me so much that I really want to read more about the Indian tribes and their cultures. I just wish there was about 100 more pages to the novel. There was not a boring part in this book, but everyting good must come to an end. Over all a great book. Worth the read."
5,excellent read,I absolutely enjoyed this book! It was both historically interesting and educational as well as an entertaining great read. I will check out more of Jim Fergus' books and would like for him to know how much I loved this book
1,Our Book Club extremely disliked this book,We thought the characters were unbelievable and one dimensional.The entire book was a collection of the author's disjointed fantasies.
5,Was so intrigued by this book- just couldn't put it down-,"This book is unlike any other that I have read. The author is sure to let you know from the beginning that it is fiction, however after reading this book you will do some wondering. Don't take this book on a vacation- you will never want to leave the hotel and do anything else! Already interested in Native American History, this makes me want to do some research and learn more about the Cheyenne Tribe."
5,The best book I've read in 2 years!,"I am a woman with 3 children, I rarely get to finish a book in one weekend, but................I had read a review of this book, and couldn't wait to get my hands on it. While visiting a friend I saw this book laying in a pile with many others. With much excitement I asked my friend if she had read it. ""No. Take it home with you""YES!!!!! It just so happened that , that night I came down with an awful bout of the flu, stayed in bed all weekend.I was never so thankful to get the flu in my life. To read this book from beginning to end, with every waking moment was an incredible experience! So rich, and fascinating. May Dodd is a character I doubt I will ever forget.I have reccomened this book to anyone that even mentions a need for ""...a good book...""You will not be disappointed."
2,I felt betrayed by the author,I thought this book was really good until the last couple of chapters. I felt like the author got me involved and then didn't care. The conclusion was terrible - everyone became the bad man and I felt like I was completely let down. What was the point of the whole book?
5,one thousand white women,Book was excellent very easy reading and everything described in detail.Enjoyed reading and passed book on to my daughter.
3,A good story,"Who are all you negative reviewers? Relax, the author states in the book its not a true story. I am a history buff and have read extensively about the west, western expansion and native Americans. While the books depiction of tribal life and some events seem un plausible it is a great story. Relax, enjoy the characters and the story. Three Stars a worthy buy and relaxing quite."
5,Takes you to a different world,I loved this book! It took me to a different world in a different time. I couldn't put it down. Excellent! This book reminds me of Memoirs of a Geisha because you are transported into a different world. I would highly recommend this book.
2,"Great idea, disappointing execution","I thought this was a fantastic idea for a novel and was eager to read it but was disappointed in the actual book. It does seem to be well-researched but I felt that the characters were two-dimensional stereotypes and seemed to be written simply to be sympathetic for a contemporary reader, with contemporary sensibilities. They were not believeable 19th century characters. As a woman, I also felt that the main character was too obviously a woman's perspective written by a man."
2,Fluff,"Fergus clearly did much research into the life and behavior of the Cheyenne. Sadly, the device of a romance to tell the story diminished the very real trials of the Cheyenne. A Thousand White Women reminded me of books I read as a child. Some better than this. Members of my book club loved the book and most agreed that this book was less than it might have been."
5,"Excellent, excellent.",One of the best books I have ever read. Very tight plot and extremely well written. Almost makes you think it's non-fiction. Highly reccommended.
4,Love Rockports,Nice dress shoe...very comfy as are all the Rockports and the look sharp with slacks in the office. Only complaint is they are slightly tight especially if you are stuck at your desk for more than an hour at a time...then again maybe it is my feet.
1,Ms Tina,"I Did not like this book, it was slow and I was able to predict the end of the book. Do not buy this book I would get it from the library or borrow it from someone else that made the mistake of buying it like me. I was not one of my triple crown favorites."
3,Cleans okay but make sure to rinse dishes off first,I use earth friendly everything in my house. This product didn't clean my dishes well at all. I always rinse the food off my dishes but if I missed a spot of any food it would still be on there when my dishes were finished in the dishwaser. It also left my dishes looking dingy. I love other Seventh Generation Prodcuts just not this one.UPDATE: We had to start using this product again because our other brand Earth Friendly Wave Gel isn't avaliable to buy in town anymore. Don't know if Seventh Generation has changed the formula but it works a little beter. Still I have to make sure to rinse the dishes before going into the dishwasher. On the plus side the dishes no longer come out looking dingy.
4,Natural Dishwashing liquid,This product works very well for us. Not sure I notice any degredation from our old brand. We now try to buy as much natural product as possible and thus recommend this cleaner.
1,Don't buy this,"I concur with the other one-star reviews - this stuff simply doesn't work. I usually buy powder dishwasher detergent, but this was the only 'green' option for detergent at the store where I bought it. This leaves a film on my dishes, and does not get my dishes clean. It leaves a lot of food residue on the dishes. I've used both Trader Joe's and Ecover powdered detergent, both of which worked well. I will not be buying this again, and I don't even know that I'll be finishing up the bottle of this."
2,Doesn't work!,"I am an all natural promoter. I was excited to find detergent that did not release harmful, hormone confusing chemicals in my home. But unfortunately, this product does not work well. I bought a case of six in my zeal and have not been happy repeatedly. I am having to re-wash a third of my dishes by hand. If you ""wash"" your dishes before you put them in the dishwasher this product will work for you, but if you are a person who thinks your dishwasher should be able to clean your dishes after you rinse them off you will be disappointed. Shaklee's dishwasher detergent works much better."
4,Gets your dishes squeaky clean.,"I tried this brand because I was looking for a more environmentally friendly dishwashing liquid. This product contains no phosphates and no chlorine and this helps to reduce the risk of harm to our waterways.I haven't been disappointed. It gets my dishes super clean without any residue. The only thing, I've noticed is that if you have something with stains, like a coffee cup, that it doesn't always remove the stain 100%. An easy way to get around this is to rinse and wipe the cup before putting it in the dishwasher.All and all, I would recommend this product to everyone."
4,Highly functional but not as functional as mainstream,Not as strong as Cascade but we need to buy Seventh Generation so that market forces will generate a ecofriendly AND highly effective cleaner.
1,Doesnt' get tea stains off of cups,"This dishwashing detergent not only does not clean very well, but it leaves any cups that were filed with tea looking as if they were never washed. I'm not talking about herbal ""tea"" here. Or even green tea, which is easier to deal with. But real black tea. (Which, by the way, has been maligned horribly by the press and is actually very healthy for you.) I got sick of having to do loads several times over, so I just threw this detergent away.There are brands that do get tea stains off. Palmolive ECO is the best. Try it if you can get it. For some reason, grocery stores are starting to stock nothing but Cascade, another dud in the cleaning department."
1,Wash your dishes in the river.,"I bought a pack of 6 for the environment, but now I am washing my dishes before I put them in the dishwasher. This is not only redundant, but wasteful of water. I now use a petroleum based product that cleans the dishes. I use several other Seventh Generation products, but this one is not worth your money."
5,Test Set,I bought this set to test and see if I was willing to invest in a whole set.My worry was that they seemed small and light. Once I receive them and tried them for a few days I was very pleased at how they fit in my hands and how well balanced they were. I have since bought an entire set of 8.
1,Item not as described...,Item not as described. Recieved Sirius low profile antenna instead. Saw this was a complaint from another reviewer but decided to give it a shot anyway. Fail. Go thru another vendor.
2,BRAVE TRY,"Tillman, the master of Naval aviation history, made a brave attempt to make a clear and historically correct picture about NAVY fighter squadrons in WW II and their aces but, he didn't ! THe book is ""cold"", in a dictionary-like style. His job was made hard, because there were duplication of squadron numbers through all the war, squadrons disabled, two squadrons using the same number with totally different teams... (unlike the USAAF). It's not to read from back-to-back."
2,I HOPE,"I hope TIllman[s next books be better than this one, in the sytle of ""wILDCATS aCES OF ww II "". THis one here was a great dissappointment."
2,Not What I Expected...,"I had thought that this would be a great ending to a stunning trilogy. Reading the back, it seemed that this book had it going- the half-sister from America thing and all. I was excited, because I aboslutely loved Born in Ice, and I liked Born in Fire. But I was so disappointed. To me, Shannon was a shallow character and Murphy was just well...boring. I didn't understand why Shannon felt compelled to go to Ireland if she was so bitter about her biological father. The ""dream"" also a rather corny thing to add into what was already a cruddy story. A boring novel, complete with boring characters. The only thing I liked about it, really, was the ending- I couldn't reach it fast enough."
4,"Conspiracies within conspiracies, with aliens and more.","The plot and storyline are like a good X-files episode -- filled with intigue, action and villainous characters galore. The action is fast paced and overall a good read, but the Area 51 / Roswell / alien abduction premise has worn a bit thin in recent years. A good book to take to the beach with you this summer."
2,Too difficult to clean. Sorry we bought it.,I wrote a review yesterday. Too hard to clean. Would not recommend it. Cuisinart has a better product. alsWallmart is $25 cheaper for the same item as yours.
1,Lasts just a few months before food sticks,"This is my third Foreman grill. The concept is great but the quality is poor. The worse part is the ""nonstick"" surface quickly is lost and food sticks horribly to the grill. Cleanup is time consuming and you never can quite get it all off. I am done. The only reason I have this third grill was because it was a Christmas gift. Prior to it, I had vowed never to buy another. The last one had inter-changeable plates but, get this, you can't buy replacement plates!!!! Im going to buy a grill that I dont need to replace every few months. Or at least one with plates you can purchase."
2,"If you're looking for just a song, look elsewhere...","I was in the process of making a holiday mix CD and decided to purchase individual songs.""You're a mean one, Mr. Grinch"" was a must-have.However, I should have either:a) Read the reviews before purchasing with 1-click (as one reviewer said, this CD is just a transcription of the movie we all grew up with. Why would I want the exact same thing on CD?!?) OR...b) Known that the song wasn't 5 minutes long, even if you put the two parts of the song together. 0:59 seconds of the track is the song I wanted, and the rest is Boris Karloff reading the story. It's cutoff in a random spot, so it's completely unusable on the mix CD.What a waste of 99 cents. :("
1,thin as paper,"Horrible..returning it...it is as thin as a piece of paper...very disappointed in the quality.i figured for $25 it would be small, but never imagined it would be so thin..."
3,"DMB at their worst, but still enjoyable","It's good to see the Dave Matthews Band put out a DVD. The sound is awesome, the picture is INCREDIBLE, and it's great to see so vividly one of the best artists of the decade. But for the life of me, I cannot make myself like the show itself. It is amazingly dull for a DMB concert. Just go back and listen to Live at Red Rocks, then listen to how devoid of energy Listenr Supported sounds. With all the great concerts from the '99 tour, it is a shame that the DVD and live CD were wasted on this show. And the background singers in this thing really got on my nerves. All this said, it's still a great video. Even when DMB is at their worst, they are still enjoyable. This is really a good purchase, especialy for Dave fans."
5,Extolling the virtues of The DMB,"I must say that I am deeply impressed with the effort put fourth for this DVD release. The DMB went to the trouble of capturing the video from different camera angles, creating a smoking Dolby Digital release and just basically knocking my socks off! Very few musicians have put the time and effort in to the DVD format to create a piece that harnesses the potential of DVD but The DMB comes through for the faithful.I am also compelled to mention the fact that if you've never seen a DMB show then you can't appreciate how close they've come to capturing the energy that can be felt at their live shows.Truly a treat, especially for those with an affinity for good music."
3,More games,This was a request from my middle son. He likes it and he is happy with it so that is 'okay'.
5,Never buying conditioner again.,"I live in a dorm and don't have a lot of time or room to get my hair looking great. My hair is brittle from ironing it everyday and people tell me to chop all of my hair off , but i refuse. I've tried a lot of things like sunsilk TLC, night serum by freida, ect.... I figured a dollar something wouldn't hurt so i bought this at my local walgreens. I put it on after shampooing and blow dried my hair all over the place. I was expecting it to get frizzy and puffy but it was straight and shiny. I'm never buying conditioner again."
4,Not too shabby,"while other customers mock this book's lack of research, this is what i say to them: lighten up. yes, it is a non fiction and should be accurate but nontheless it is still interesting. i would recommend this book to whoever is interested in piracy. it displays the brutness and darker sides of piracy. it was interesting"
5,"Countries and Concepts: Politics, Geography, Culture","Hi. When I recieved the book, it was in great shape. I recieved it in a very timely manner, even before I was told it would be to me. Thanks for being prompt. I ordered the book to late for when my class was starting, though when I recieved it I was only into the 2nd day of class. It made doing my assignments alot easier. I like ordering my textbooks from amazon, they are great quality and a fraction of the price of my college bookstore. I will continue to purchase books through amazon as long as they have the books I need. I applaud you for a job well done. Paula Sachse"
5,Excellent service and product is as described,Excellent service and product received was as described. Thanx will do business again.
2,Terrible,I bought this game for my 11 year old cousin. I played and we took turns. The only thing good about this is that it is a little violent. Everything was bland. The graphics are good for GameCube standards. This game makes Aquaman (GameCube) look like Resident Evil 4! Overall this game is terrible. I traded it in for 10 dollars. You should only pay under a dollar for it. It's not worth it.
2,At the Last Trumpet: Jesus Christ and the End of Time (William Barclay...,This book is a collection of previously published excerpts from Barclay's numerous Bible study writings where he just incidentally mentions something related to Christ's second coming. The books advertisement led me to believe that Barclay was giving his entire focus to this subject. The book was edited and put together years after his death and I considered it a rip-off. I respect Barclay and own a number of his writings. This one I don't even plan to keep.
5,WOW! What a Great Band!,"I got this CD when I saw this band perform in Sacramento. What energy! I just love their music. I've seen them perform many times and they always deliver. Great rock sound. I highly recommend this CD--you won't be disappointed. I'm especially a big fan of the lead singer, Ryan Gillmor--he rocks."
4,What can I say? The Crue Rock.,"Disc 1 is better than disc 2. I only like about five or six songs from the second CD. Too bad I couldn't get rid of four songs from the first CD and then ""cut & paste"" the good songs from disc 2. Anyway you look at this compilation, Motley Crue will always have a place in my heart."
5,buy this cd now,motley crues red white and crue is a rocking cd a true greatest hits with some new songs from the crue this cd covers a whole erra of motley crue and the beginning of a new era my suggestion is to go buy this c.d............now!ps if it aint metal its crap
5,The Crue IS back,Its a wonderful album. Unlike many rock band renunions the crue is back and they are fresh. This cd is tight. Even if you were not a fan before you will be now. And if u were before you will wonder where the crue has been the last years. It sounds like they havent stopped playing together.
3,Imagine That ... Another Motley Compilation,"I'm all for capitalism and whatnot, but seriously ...Vince buffet hisself to the poor house? Nikki need a new defibrillator?Or are we all just trying to keep up with the KISSes?And how many times is ""Without You"" gonna make the cut, 'cause this is getting silly. Really now.Other than that, great stuff. Mad props, exspecially, to T-bizZONE, for consistently keeping it so very real while the rest sadly front.Word."
1,One of many trying to capitalise on Japan bashing,"The book was a complete and utter disappointment. Someone trying to capitalise on the difference between the East and West of doing things. Why do Americans always feel that there notions of the world have to be correct - that is the thought that I had instantly when I read this ""masterpiece"". It is certainly not worth owning - sorry to say."
5,wonderful,"Children and adults will say, ""ahh""! This is a great cuddle toy or item to display. It is not especially durable, but will handle being carried most places by children."
2,Poorly made cat,"Delivery was suprisingly fast! I think I got Snip 3 days after it was ordered. The problem was the toy itself. The head is smaller than it should be along with being shaped like a football. The ears and eyes are NOT where they should be. Its very noticeably disfigured! I wonder how the company didn't notice! Its very disappointing since I've wanted this particular beanie for years, I finally get it my Snip and its mishapen.This very well could be a simple case of someone not paying attention but I doubt ill order another toy from them."
1,Not an honest book,"I tried very hard to like this book and look for something good in it. I guess if you've never dated, you might find it a good primer for getting started. But even that's a stretch.I don't see honesty from Star. [...] she changes her story too often and is inconsistent in how she presents her views or experiences. I think she wants to be something she's not, and that's the face she's presenting. This book is a whitewash over the reality of Star's life and I think we deserve a little more respect from an author asking us for money..."
3,Like Blowin' in the Wind,"An experimental memoir - is it fact or fiction? Whatever, it's an artwork that defies easy comprehension, like a Dylan song. The occasional asides on his views of other artists are fun. Just don't expect answers to any questions you may have."
3,Bob Dylan,"Good book, mostly about the people he meets on the way. Not much about his family life, although he does touch on this a few times in the book."
5,Reveals so much,"and was also an education. Dylan shares important portions of his life and tells the tale in his own unique style. Each sentence is so poetic. He came across to me, as a sensitive human, aware of everything he saw, heard, touched-and said how all these things formed his creativity. I felt this was a beautiful story. I appreciated how he did not tell his life in the usual A B C way, he went in swoops and circled back to the start. Unlike some other reviewers here, I adored the section about New Orleans and his work with Daniel Lanois. He showed his humanity, Dylan bravely showed his fears and his desires.I want to not only delve further in to his music ( having loved much of his music for years) but experience the people who influenced him. Robert Johnson and Woody Guthrie, even Joan Baez' early work...An amazing and beautiful book, soulful and enriching. Read it!"
2,Expected something more,"As I read through Dylan's book I couldn't help but feel most of the book is relating his preferences for music and all the people he has met during his life. Dylan will devote pages to totally incidental things and then gloss over or omit a key event. Besides that, the book is intentionally not chronological for no apparent reason which really confuses all the forward looking phrases like ""it was not that time yet.""Overall I would say that the book speaks more to Dylan's taste in music than it does to his own humanity and in the end I don't feel I grasp his person much better than before I read the book."
5,great storytelling,"The first of several projected volumes, CHRONICLES reads like expanded journal entries from various periods of Dylan's life. It's immensely enjoyable -- his reputation as a master wordsmith is amply demonstrated in these vignettes. It's all done with a wink -- you don't know whether to believe him or not, but it's thoroughly engaging, and in the end these sorts of things are all just impressions and versions anyway, right? It's RASHOMON (the Kurosawa film), there is no one truth. In fact there isn't even one truth for one person, because each of us, and certainly Dylan, is always changing. So what we have here are recollections and reflections on the Dylans Then from the Dylan Now. If you don't expect anything but what Dylan Now chooses to tell, in his own time, you won't be disappointed."
4,I Was Wrong,"From his autobiography, it appears that I was really wrong about my conception of Bob Dylan. He wasn't a ""protest singer"" or ""leader of progressive causes and disaffected youth"", but rather a father, husband, well-read intellectual and musician. It's interesting to get Dylan's take on such golden oldies as Ricky Nelson and Roy Orbison. His book is also peppered with references to many people with whom I'm unfamiliar, but this didn't detract from my overall enjoyment of this candid autobiography"
2,Disappointed,"Did not think it was well written. I love his music, but his book was as bad as one of his live concerts."
4,An interesting and informative look at an oft maligned leader...,"I rather enjoyed this 2 hour retrospective on the decade of Tony Blair as PM. There were many many interviews with co workers, as well as political aids and enemies. I felt the storytelling was even handed and without an agenda which allows the viewer to enjoy the information without being overly manipulated. If you are also curious the movie ""the Deal"" starring Michael Sheen as Tony Blair I recently viewed and found an almost perfect opening film for this. I'm looking forward to reading Mr Blairs substantial autobiography after viewing this program. I purchased it for considerably less than the list price from a marketplace seller and am happy..as I don't believe its worth the high list price...its not something one would revisit often ...if ever."
5,Delightful!,"I have to disagree with the poor review below. This is a WONDERFUL CD of medieval music, and I have many to compare it to! The instrumentals are light, fun and cleverly arranged. And I love the vocals. They're perfect for this style of music - clean, clear, and sometimes folksy. Vivien Ellis's soprano is lovely. The nasal intonation of the men on a few of the numbers (and it is not extreme--I've heard it done much stronger) reflects a choice some early musicians make based on the remnants of this music that still exist within the modern folk music traditions that descend from it. Give this gem a chance and you won't be disappointed. It's a joyful and refreshing trip into the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, with elements both gently alien and pleasantly familiar. I play it over and over again and have not yet tired of it. Happy listening!"
5,Ask your Guides,This is the sort of book that when you have finished reading you go over and over again.Money well spend for what you get back.Sonia's information is easy to understand.
2,Details vague,Details sketchy. Would have like a more in depth description of events. Writer rambles on too much. I didn't even finish it. Next...
3,Some Sick People,"This book has me scared to go anywhere alone. I love reading true crime books but this was a little on the sick side. I don't think it was as messed up as House of Secrets, but I'm glad its over so I don't have to ready it anymore."
1,Horrible Item. DO NOT purchase,I got this in place of the Ipecac syrup because I couldn't find the syrup anywhere. These tablets are like the mini packing peanuts you find in items. They are like tiny little beads. And they don't work. I took the recommended dose but nothing happened so I kept taking these little things and still nothing happened. I'm convinced these aren't medicine at all but tiny dis solvable tablets.
3,Enjoyed,"As I recall, this was a good book! That's about all I can remember; the course where I used this book was completed in the fall of 2010, but the course was on Gender, so the book was fitting."
2,Product does not fit DVD outer title inserts,I returned this product as it does not accommodate the outer title insert - only the inner page. Product recommended for customers who do not wish to keep the outer slipcase cover page.
5,Love this TV,Only thing is----do not watch one channel to long to avoid burning---especially those stations that have watermarks or tickers----probably the same goes for video games.
1,I have a popper too!,"Have the Zenith plasma 50"" Z50PX2D purchased 4/6/07. We are probably below average TV users and TV popped Sept. 11, 2008. 17 months after install. Did not buy extended warranty. TV repairman from store that TV was purchased from picked up TV and has had it for 2 weeks with no news. I started looking for a new TV and came across all these ""popping"" reviews. I will call local store to inform him of this problem and that I am not alone. However, when I called checking on status, clerk said he has 8 flat screens that he is working on and waiting for parts! I will also call the 877-543-8325 posted previously and see what they can do for us. Update: Called LG & talked to a supervisor and he is helping me. My confidence for Zenith/LG has been restored!"
1,Don't buy it!,"I bought this Zenith plasma tv, exactly 1 year and 8 mos ago from Circuit City. Paid $2400. At he begining everything was awesome, but,...it popped yesterday.Of course, like many others people, I trusted Zenith to be a product of good reputacion and quality, WRONG!!!..I was just another sucker, and by trusting this product, I did not buy any extended warranty.I don't recommend this TV at all, they (Zenith) should have a recall on this BAD product. Sorry for you people that still think it's ok to buy it anyway, you'll regret it later as I do now.DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY"
3,DIDNT LAST LONG AGAIN!!,"Yup, heres another one. Great picture, even greater with HD channels especially Direct TV's NFL package. Discover HD is just incredible. Last Sunday my son was watching cartoons in the morning and POP there goes the picture. This TV was exactly 53 weeks old. I purchased the extended warranty offered by Best Buy so lets see how that goes."
1,"buyer beware- good tv until it ""pops"" and the screen goes out","I would rate zero stars but the minimum is one. Ours popped 3 months outside the one year warranty. LG(maker of zenith's) has such poor customer service. They said they had to have someone review issue and call me back. No call for 2 wks.I called again and again. No one ever did call me, but on my 3rd callback they said it was out of warranty and we should've bought the extended warranty at the time of purchase. $2800.00 for 15 months of TV use is not something Zenith/LG care about. When I mentioned this was a known problem since it's posted on the internet, they denied knowing of issue. I wish someone would get a class action suit against LG."
4,A nice compilation.,"Yea, I own them all, but sometimes you just can't decide. This compilation makes for a nice traveling disc."
1,Crashes my computer!,"Jason needs to work on his website.Everytime my Jornada 720 (www.hpcfactor.com) access it, I get a crash.Take out the Java Jason!"
5,Great read,"Even though my work does not deal with financial stuff, and my real contact with that world does not go beyond managing my 401(k), I have found this book totally fascinating and engaging. It has been a much better read than many 'thrillers' that have been in my hands. The writing is great and the characters are portrayed with vivid details. More interestingly, it made me realize that whatever we have seen in the last year is a deja vu all over again."
3,What does all this have to do with 'business'?,"The author said it himself, ""What does all this have to do with business? "". I bought this book hoping to get an insight into how large companys are run. Unfortunately it was full of details on how companys are sold, not run. I suppose if that is what you are after, then the book does its job. But if you wanted to learn something about real business, this is NOT the book for you."
1,Defective by Design,"The drill is a real shame coming from such a long established brand name that had made so many great tools. The side handle is made of a cheap plastic and attaches to the drill near the chuck with a cheap plastic hose clamp.That area near the chuck is round and painted smooth. Even when you tighten the thumb screw, the side handle is not secure. If you were to put a real bolt in place of the thumb screw, the plastic hose clamp would crack. The tool has plenty of power and torque being 6.5 amps, and so, if you are turning screws that are stiff, or drilling into something hard, the handle will slip and the whole tool will get ripped from the other hand."
1,Of the four games in this set only...,"...""Prisoner of Azkaban"" is any good...the other three are older and have relatively primitive graphics and mediocre gameplay -- far be it from EA Games to go back and update older games to match newer games...however, what dragged the rating down to a single star was EA Games customer service...my set came without the serial numbers needed to install the games!...I emailed their customer service who then insisted I snail mail proof of purchase and a photocopy of the white strip on the back of the jewel case to their office in California...once verified they would send me the needed numbers by return snail mail...are they kidding?!...what a JOKE!...anyway, I went online and after about five MINUTES of searching found a ""warez"" site that allowed me to download the serials for free!...and also bear in mind that the games REQUIRE the CD to be in the computer when playing even if you transfer the entire game onto your hard drive."
4,Review for younger players,"My 5yr old likes most of the games. He plays Sorcerer's Stone well, but has difficulty with Quiddich and Prisoner, but the package deal was well priced.The Chamber of Secrets hasn't worked since we bought it. I have a service request with EA Games, but they have not resolved the issue."
4,HP,"It helps to be a fan of Harry Potter to enjoy this game. It's not an overly difficult game at all. I just completed HP and the SS yesterday and have begun HP and the CS. The graphics aren't all that great, but I did notice that in CS they are better than SS."
5,A wonderful game,"My children, age 7 and 8 play this game all the time. They love it! The graphics are great."
2,Copped Images,"Most of the photos in this book are full-bleed with the photos thusly cropped to fit the panoramic format of the book. It's a small, thick book with a huge number of images by Basilico, whose work I love. However, I feel that by cropping so many of the images, the sense of his precision in composing the photos is lost."
1,Did we all read the same book??!,"3 5-star ratings? Are you kidding me?! This book is awful, awful, awful.Now that I've read the description, I understand that it was adapted from a teleplay and maybe that accounts for some of the stilted writing, but this is not at all the quality of writing I've come to expect from Marc Brown. In fact, I would have guessed that he had some contractural obligation to write this and deliberately put almost no effort into making it even remotely enjoyable.There are plenty of other Arthur books that I enjoy (despite the fact that he does not look at all like an aardvark, which is allegedly is), but this one has got to go before my kid asks me to read it again."
2,Tough Book,This is not an easy book. The language is preety tough and the writer seems to assume that you already know C. The terminology is hard to understand. I went and bought an oreily book and I learnt alot more from that smaller book than this book.
1,This book is not for a beginner C programmer!,The presentation of new and basic topics by L.S. Foster is poorly done. Most of the time that I have invested in learning to program in C has been trying to understand the textbook. The examples used are not presented in a logical manner. I have had to refer to additonal textbooks to understand the most basic topics. Best of luck to you if you purchase this book.
5,first person shooter,Painkiller was one of the greatest FPS games out there. Battle out of hell was no exception. It did not dissapoint at all.I can't wait for the next one.
4,frickin hard!,"I played Painkiller on Nightmare mode and had no problem beating the game. However, playing BooH on Nightmare mode is asking for, well, just that: a nightmare. Just like the dude said, you will be staring at the loading screen A LOT. Leningrad was probably the most annoying level in the world, because the enemies have CRAZY accuracies. And the Coliseum level has some annoying tricks and traps.Other than that, the environment is stunningly detailed (just like the original), and Daniel's face is improved (he looks more manly now, instead of retarded).If you're a fan of the original game, you will like this one. And in my opinion, 10 levels is plenty for an expansion pack. Besides, the weapons are pretty cool, and the ending is *unexpected*."
4,Good value,"I've owned this scale for quite some time now, and have been very happy with it. As someone pointed out, the fat % can vary wildly. I am pretty sure that it's actually measuring water content (read that somewhere in the manual I think), and so if you don't have a stable body-water content, then the percentages will be wildly variable. Most people are dehydrated, I've found, so the numbers are wrong. Once I got back to drinking the amount of water I needed (prob 64oz/day), I've found the numbers to be not only stable, but also close to what a professional measurement will get you."
5,FOR THE SMALL TOWN SPORTS LOVER IN ALL OF US,"I HIGHLY RECCOMEND GETTING IN THE GAME FOR ANYONE WHO LOVED SPORTS WHEN THEY WERE YOUNGER AND STILL FOLLOWS THEM WITH A PASSION. THIS BOOK WILL MAKE YOU LAUGH SO HARD YOU CRY, FROM THE TIME PHIL BELCHER WAS A BABY, THROUGH ALL THE YEARS OF PAROCHIAL SCHOOL AND THEN HIGH SCHOOL. THEN AS HE ""GROWS UP"" YOU WILL HAVE THE URGE TO CRY EVEN WITHOUT LAUGHING. IF WE'RE LUCKY PERHAPS THERE WILL BE A SEQUEL!!"
5,Loved The Show !!!,"I greatly enjoyed this show. Having met Mark Lewis, the producer, he really did a fine job of putting together over 500 hours of taped interviews and showed ferret owners as real people. I hope he wins another Emmy for this show.Living in Columbus I have the oportunity to go to the Ferret Buckeye Bash every year and can attest that it great show to go to. Ferret owners should consider coming and showing their pets. I for one will purchase the DVD to show support to PBS and Radio Pictures so they will continue to produce this type of program."
3,could have been better,"It gave alot of information about showing ferrets, but it didn't really get into the details of what it would take to care for one. It glamorized ferrets as an ideal pet and didn't say anything about what goes into owning one responsibly. It is good for getting the word out about these wonderful pets, but it also makes ferret owners look a little crazy."
5,.....and Lime Popsicles,"Lime Popsicles were my favorite as a child and now I find I am not alone in my indulgence of such childhood delights as an adult. Rejuvenile is a book that allows us to evaluate our own inner child and desire to recapture childhood along many avenues. Some people have organized activities such as tag and dodgeball. Some express their child through collecting tangible items such as toys. As adults they allow themselves to enjoy Disneyland as much as the children they come with. This is a fun, joyful book-one that I looked forward to reading at the end of a hectic workday."
1,Another loonie anti-Bush book.,"Vinnie Vin is just one of many DemocraticUnderground whack jobs, who thinks that Bush is the Chimperor, and calls Republicans ""Rethuglican brownshirted nazis"", and thinks that Bush won because of a Rovian PNAC conspiracy. Go to DU and read his witless posts before you waste a penny on this book. You can bet that all of the rave reviews of this book are written by his DUmmy friends."
1,Response to R. Huston,I purchased the this TV today 04/16/2005. Good price $299.00 at Sam's Club. Unfortunately and ironically I have Comcast Analog in Boston area. I get all cable channels except 5 and 6..... Magnavox Customer service determined it was a bad tuner. Suggested to send for repairs. It's being returned to Sam's Club tomorrow. For refund not replacement. Good luck.
4,The clash of good and evil,"Dillon, a mega-successful stockbroker is jaded by life, and tormentedby dark sexual fantasies that find their outlet in a chance meetingwith the engimatic 'Dark Lady'. He is willing to risk everything,including his professional reputation and marriage to Karen for theshort sharp thrill of a night with this mysterious woman, who iscalled Veronica, in the process selling his soul to the devil. This isnot simply an exploration of what can go wrong when one attempts tomake fantasy reality, it is much more than that, a truly engrossingthriller, where no character is what they originally seem. Brooksexposes the different facets of each character, showing each one to bea mixture of good and evil. Besides being a compulsive read it alsotakes a sideways swipe at the life of the rich, and the hollow livesbehind the dazzling facade. Watch out - this book is destined to makea great Hollywood blockbuster!"
5,Extremely touching story.,"This is a very touching story of providential reunion after decades of separation. The story leads slowly and almost unnoticed up toward a dawning realization and then a both stunning and magnificent climax. Just passing by it here, I had to stop and leave a quick review. While most of my best books get 5 stars, this one gets 6. Well, maybe not quite 6, but no less than 5.5!"
3,These are just not that tasty!!,I bought these a couple of years ago and still have a couple packages in the freezer. It's time to discard these frozen ones like I did ALL the other packages I opened to taste a FEW cherries but could not make myself eat any more of them. What a waste! I don't find these to be delicious at all. They barely taste like cherries and are rather rubbery. One thing I have to give them credit about is that they are NOT loaded with sugar. That is why I bought them in the first place. I may be comparing these to fresh cherries though so it's really like comparing apples and oranges.....it's unfair on my part. I suggest you buy one package locally before buying a whole case like I did. You may like them....I did not!
1,iPhone cable.,This item got here in a timely manner yet after 3 weeks of use it broke. Yes the part that connects into the wall unit. Glad the price was right yet now I have no charger =(.
1,Don't BUY!!!!,"These are poorly made. I bought 6 of them because I'm always losing them & what not. What a waste of my money! They look NOTHING like the picture, they're just a ripoff. I would NOT reccomnd this product to anyone. They suck & are extremely useless."
2,Works but looks used,"The cord I purchased was from Boho Tronics. At first glance it looks used and somewhat dirty. One part of the cord is slightly scraped. I didn't actually expect it to work but it did, although I'm not sure how great of a charge it gave.For $1.20 it does the job but don't expect a new product. I've purchased generic Apple cords/chargers on Amazon before and this is the first time I've gotten something that looks used. It also takes forever to ship to you so don't expect it to come soon. Apple uses the same cord for ipods, iphones and ipads."
3,"Yes, Cheap, but it works",The connection is a little tight on the ipod. And I really don't think this was made by Apple -- not high quality like apple.But it works! And it's cheap! Go for it!
1,Did not work with iPad,"This connector did not wok with my iPad and Windows laptop. With this connector, my iPad would never synch with iTunes."
1,More patent-stealing Chinese crap,"I'm in the market for an iPod data cable for my Touch. I don't care if I have to spend $25 on an official Apple cable or $15 on an American made officially licensed cable. I'm not buying anymore Chinese knock-off stuff, not matter what the price disparity is. We want all our politicians to fix our economy through legislation and tax manipulation but until we stop giving the Chinese the green light to manufacture our own products for their own profit we're going to keep buoying their economy and short-changing our own. Even if the official cable is made in China, at least the profit is coming back to America. We have to start somewhere and where better than the last free economy in the world? Amazon."
1,Piece of crap,"It is cheap and yes, you might get lucky, and the cable will actually work. I didn't. It was all right the first couple of days but then suddenly started disconnecting and now it doesn't connect at all."
1,Trash - As expected,This fell apart within 30 seconds of extra gentle use. Complete garbage.The price looked like it was too good to be true - it was.Can't say that I wasn't warned.
3,Product not as pictured,"I understand one takes risk into his own hands when purchasing a third-party item, but the item delivered looks nothing like the original. While completely functional as an iPhone dock connector, ascetically it's bulky and ugly looking. Please don't believe the online photos they have included of Apple's cable--looks nothing like it!That being said, it does work, which is why I gave it three stars."
4,Great Deal!,"Worked like a charm no problems with it at all. The product worked great and charged my Iphone, great deal."
1,Does not work,Does NOT work - DO NOT BUY. It will cost more to return that you paid for the product!
2,to loose,"the connection is to loose,if you move your phone just alittle it start the sync all over again.maybe it is just my phone but I don't have problems with other chargers."
1,you get what you pay for,"the wire is a piece of crap and it is barely staying together. that said, for the price I paid ($1.97?)it is doing the trick. I did not want to spend $20 on a new wire for my eight year old daughters Ipod so this does the trick..."
3,You get what you pay for,Housing on USB connector has already cracked. I guess you get what you pay for.
2,Meh...but worth the price,"I only got one but the first time I used it, when I pulled it out of the phone the device end came apart. It's easy to push back in but it's quite annoying. It's really cheap, but I'm sure there're higher quality for a better price somewhere out there."
2,Not what is pictured,"This is just a third party dock connector that was probably made with poor quality materials. You get what you pay for, really, but mine doesn't even allow me to sync my 2nd gen ipod touch to my computer. Right now all it can do is charge."
2,Worked well for one month then quit,"I don't know why or how this is possible, but I purchased two of these, and they both worked fine for about a month, and then both quit. I was using them on different computers, neither one in a wall or car charger. Perhaps this won't happen to you, but it was certainly inconvenient for me."
1,Doesn't Sync nor Charge,"Ordered cord 1/13/09 received 1/21/09. Tried to sync iphone to computer using cord, received several errors. Tried to charge phone, using cord and screen froze. Couldn't view text, selected icons or power off iphone. Had to use reset method to correct iphone. Errors NEVER appeared when using the cord Apple provided with Iphone. Contacted seller for return information & I am awaiting a response. May not return if shipping & action costs more then the $5 i paid to purchase cord."
4,not for myself,I purchased this for a gift. I haven't had any complaints so far. I could only suspect that it works properly.
1,Garbage - Don't waste your time,"This item is cheap and has mixed reviews. I thought I would take a gamble at this price. I bought two since they were so inexpensive. Each one lasted thru one use. The item is so flimsy and poorly made, that the stress placed upon it to pull it out of the charging port will break it. Not a huge waste of money, but a waste of time and added hassle (It took almost two weeks to receive). I wish I could give this item 0 stars. Bottom line....you get what you pay for. If you are looking for a disposable charger for a one-time use...then this is just the thing."
5,great.,This works great. I have no issues with it. I would recommend this to other buyers that need this cord fast.
3,Dock Connector to USB 2.0 Cable for iPod and iPhone (White),"Dock Connector to USB 2.0 Cable for iPod and iPhone (White)This is supposed to be an Apple product. It did not have Apple on the bag it came in.The release mechanism is very hard to operate, unlike the Apple product it replaced.However, this is a great value!BTW, I found my original cable.The iPhone end of this cable broke. It lasted about 2 years. Not too bad for the price I reckon. nyuk nyuk nyuk"
3,Company Made a Good Attempt To Correct Mistake,"I originally posted:""I sent an email stating that the cord they advertised as iphone compatible is not! It does not work with several different plugs that I have. I emailed them between Dec. 8 and 10 and I never heard back. Totally awful experience.""That was on 12/31.They can't go back and fix the 4 week communication miss, but they did follow up and replace the cord free of charge without the need to send the old one back. They also offered me a free blue tooth headset, which I don't need, but I appreciate the offer.Also, the product is still not Apple as advertised so I'm not inclined to give them a really high rating."
1,Worst thing i've ever bought.,"This was a cheap cheap generic cord. The product title says it fits ipods and it didnt fit mine. The sticker on the cord says for 3G iphone. Also, when i received the envelope with the product in it, the mailman had to collect an extra dollar in postage from me. The seller did not specify that this would be the case, and i ran around my house trying to find a dollar. Horrible experience."
1,Item Pictured is NOT what they send,They pictured Apple cables and when I opened the envelope I was very disappointed to find they were generic cables. Please CHANGE your picture!
1,Not as advertised,Image used is official apple ipod / usb adapter. Item received is 3rd party retractable cable. It works (powers and syncs) but not what I was expecting.
1,doesn't work with newer Ipods or iphones,"bought 2, but they only work with my 1st generation ipod, not my newer Ipods or Iphone. They have not responded concerning my refund yet.Update:they are refunding my money."
1,Cheap,"This connector was to replace of the cable I got with my iPhone 4, because I was not used to being careful with the connector. I bought this, thinking it would be a quick and inexpensive fix. I ended up buying three of these cords because after no more than two weeks, they all quit working. The wiring is messed up in them, and they are CHEAP. I eventuay broke down and decided to shell out the $20 it cost for an actual one from Apple, and it's yet to fail in me. Do not buy this product, just go buy the real thing. Definitely not a recommended item from me."
4,Great for non iPhone use,"I have older iPod products, Nano, Shuffle, etc., and this product works as well as the OEM."
4,Can't beat this price,"I misplaced the doc connector within the first month of owning my ipod. Initially I thought I would have to spend $20 to replace it, but I found this little beauty for a great price to my surprise."
3,ipod apple dock connector,this was advertised as an Apple product. These were knock offs and not original cables. They work fine though.
1,not worth the money...,"This 'knock off' cable does not work correctly. iPod to computer connections are often not recognized and when used with Sync module (in Ford vehicles) sound quality is horrible (sound gaps, signal drops) and device itself is disconnected often while playing. I purchased Apple OEM connector cable and in every application where the 'knock off' cable failed to perform, the Apple cable (and connected devices) worked perfectly.I would not purchase this product again."
3,Not bad....Handle with Care.,"In short order...well...I've bought about a half dozen of these, and I'm still way ahead of the game...they work, they charge your phone, and they are fine for data-transfer, but do tend to come apart at end of cable near both connectors. Wrap a piece of tape there for extra support and you'll be fine; honestly....you'd have to buy a DOZEN of these b4 you hit the price of ONE Apple Cable...and by then, you'd have LOST your Apple cable!"
1,Description and item do not match!,"Why is it that the item is being sold as ""USB 2.0 Cable for iPod and iPhone"" but in the entire rest of the page for the item it never says it can be used for the iPhone?""Compatibility: iPod nano 1G, 2G; iPod mini; iPod 3G, 4G, 5G, 5.5G""""The iPod Dock Connector to USB Cable offers high speed data transfer for quickly loading an entire music library on iPod or iPod mini """" iPod CompatibilityiPod nano 1G, iPod nano 2G, iPod mini, iPod 3G, iPod 4G (Clickwheel), iPod Color, iPod 5G/5.5G Video """"Product DescriptionMaximize the performance of your iPod ""Entirely misleading and I expect more from Amazon."
5,docing conector USB to iPod/iPhone,"My girlfriend uses it all the time, is very happy with it.Dock Connector to USB 2.0 Cable for iPod and iPhone (White)"
1,Teribble Quality,Terrible. I ordered my cord form the seller Boho Tronics. Not only did mine stop working properly the day after I got it but the white hollow cord became disconnected from both the USB connector and the connector that goes into your ipod which exposed the smaller wires inside the hollow white cord. I won't be buying from Boho Tronics anytime soon.
2,dont work,"i had rather hav clear screen protectors or a chaarger both for iphone 3gs. the 4 replacements u sent, 2 of them worked the other two didnt. i would like for that to be made up to me . thx"
1,Not Worth It,This cable only worked like for three days. Then it didn't charge any more. Better off buying the real ones off Apple.
3,Wanted More,I was looking for a book that we could go through to really know each other on a really deep and personal level but these questions were a bit lightweight and just felt that there wasn't too much substance overall. I got 1000 Questions for Couples which was exactly what I was looking for.
3,Great Movie - Not as Good as the Comic,"I loved Public Enemies as a comic book. The story telling was amazing. The best part was seeing what Bruce and Clark were thinking and how they were always thinking about each other and how they compared. This entire dynamic is lost in the movie adaptation. It was a bit of a bummer to have my favorite part cut, but I guess that happens.As a movie by itself, it is really good. I enjoyed it immensely. If you haven't read the comic, I think you'll really enjoy this. If you have, be aware that it is a bit different, but still enjoyable."
2,What the?,"This movie was pretty lame. Has there always been so much awkward homoerotic tension between Batman and Superman? It was like watching two dudes on a bad blind-date. You'd never know from watching this movie, but Powergirl does actually have superpowers and being a completely useless tool isn't one of them.Why did Lex Luthor kiss Amanda Waller? What do you think they're going to talk about when he gets back?There was a hot second of Alfred with a shot gun, that's always fun."
3,Superman / batman public enemies,"It was on my wish list. Had a chance to catch it on a cable channel. I enjoyed the movie and the action. Now that I have seen it , I don't think it would be some thing I would watch again. I recommend seeing it if you haven't."
4,"i thoroughly enjoyed it,but the story suffers in favour of wall to wall fight sequences","i gotta say,i thoroughly enjoyed this animated offering from DC/WarnerPremiere.the animation was top notch.the voice acting was terrific.thefight scenes were outstanding.in fact,the movie was basically just onebig long fight scene after another with a veritable rogue's gallery ofDC Villains all lining up to take on Superman and Batman.of course,thestory takes a huge back seat in this case,other than a brief set up atthe beginning.and the movie is short,clocking in at just over an hournot including end credits.normally i prefer a little story depth to mymovies,but i got caught up in the action on this one.however,if you doprefer a more fleshed out storyline,you might be disappointed in thisone.for me,Superman/Batman: Public Enemies is a 4/5"
3,The mold itself is great,"5 stars for the mold but only 3 for the project it's made for. The mold is definitely well made although it did arrive slightly warped. The weight of the concrete straightens it out though.The project itself is extremely tedious. It's really not as simple as shoveling a bunch of concrete in and waiting 1 minute. If you are able to get a perfect mix (very difficult to do every time) then you still have to trowel it smooth, get the bubbles out, shape the edges and of course constantly mist the curing concrete. If your mix is at all too dry then the concrete will stick to the mold and tear your pavers up when you remove the mold. If your mix is too wet then your bricks will sag. At close to an hour's work per mold to get it right, it doesn't end up being worth the small savings over pre-made bricks and proper preparation."
4,Advertising different to what is being sent,The Mold is great. Good quality and I am yet to test it. However the companies selling this needs to specify How many molds you are getting for the price. On youtube I see they are offering two molds not knowing that here with Zap they are selling only one mold for $24.00. Clearer description needs to be placed. I am totally disappointed in that. spent all this money for one.
5,Another great product,"My wife and I purchased Pathmate a couple summers ago and the pavers have lasted over the years. Everyone that sees the back yard really like the look. It was a little slow making them at the beginning but once we got the cement consistency right, we were on a roll. I recommend only using one mold at a time because when you but one against the other the gaps are larger - not that people see it but I do. I also purchased the tumber and it worked well with the exception of the gasket falling off once in a while but it can easily be put back. Transform your space into something new. I definitely recommend this product."
2,Interesting but repetitive.,"This was an interesting and well informed book. A lot of good research went into it, and its style is clear, readable, and easy to follow. It was, however, quite repetitive, with the same points being made over and over. Most of all, though, some socialist presuppositions showed through which were disturbing. These were also repeated again and again with little additional analysis."
5,Beautiful,"Absolutely beautiful watch. The workmanship appears to be first rate. Amazon shipped with free overnight shipping, received it the day before Christmas. It was a gift for myself, and I couldn't be more pleased. I have always bought Seiko watches, decided this time to go for something different. Glad I did!"
4,2nd Time around is the charm,"The first time I ordered this from another company, it went out of stock before I got it, so it did not come in on time for xmas. This was quick, of course now it is after xmas."
4,Exit Human - 'Arvada' (Direct Hit Records),"Looks to be this trance artist's only CD. Not a bad find. Tunes I got the most out of were the nineteen-minute opening track ""Arvada"", ""I Can't Sleep"", maybe ""Lost"" and the wonderfully good ""This Engine"" (possibly this title's best cut, hands down). Ideal to play at back alley / after hour bars, Border's midnight sales (do they even have those anymore?) or at those landmark clubs in major cities that still feature such obscure touring bands as such, etc. Recommended for fans of Aphex Twin, 777, Kraftwerk and Seefeel."
4,do not remember buying it,"do not remember buying it but I'm sure it was a useful augmentation to neurology rotation and course work, for your armenmetarium"
1,Hot Fuzz music from the Motion Picture,"What can I say about this CD..... Allot. It sucks... I was under the impression that I would be able to hear each and every song, from start to finish without interruption, but ""NOOOOOOO!!!"" Come to find out the CD has snip-its from the movie tacked onto the songs...... I bought this CD for the MUSIC... NOT THE SOUND TRACK FROM THE MOVIE..... MUSIC IS THE KEY WORD ON THIS CD.... NOT SOUND TRACKS MIXED WITH THE ACTORS VOICES..... As one of my favorite sayings goes, ""WHAT THE HELL ERIC"".... I want music.... Recommend you don't waste your money on this CD..."
2,Disappointing.....,"I was anxious to read this one after all the great reviews, but I can honestly say I wasn't impressed.Kit comes off as a spoiled, pampered, silly heroine. I found myself not connected to her at all. She has been wronged by her family in the past, but her means of coping were completely childish and rubbed me wrong throughout the book.I would like to talk briefly about Pendleton, but that is difficult. We are not given a true character profile of our hero! I like to ""know"" the characters in the books I read, and Pendleton (even after reading this book) remains a mystery to me. What made him tick, what was important to him, why did he do the things he did......your guess is as good as mine!Overall...pretty disappointing. I laughed as certain times, and ""kind of"" appreciated the secondary romance, but I can't recommend the book."
2,Have I read this before?,"This book was my first by Elizabeth Bevarly, so I didn't really know what to expect. I can't really say I liked it. I thought that Pendalton was an interesting enough character, but Kit was awful. From the very beginning I didn't like her. I have to like the characters in the book in order to really enjoy it. Also, the plot has been overdone. In order to get an inheritance Kit must marry within 2 years. Haven't I read that one before?"
3,"Fun plot, but hit and miss with the writing","This book has a great premise, which is what drew me to reading the novel. It also has many well written humorous exchanges and love scenes. The author chose to have two parallel romance lines however they seemed to be out of balance. I cared a lot about the primary characters of Kit and Pendleton and how their relationship developed, but each time the story focused away from them I lost interest. I felt like I was waiting for a big revelation as to how it was all intertwined and the author never made it happen. Overall it's worth a read based on the original premise and fun of the primary characters, but I am giving it 3 stars."
4,A great Scale for the price,This scale measures body fat much more consintantly than a item I paid $ 150.00 for. It isn't perfect but for its price I think it is very good. I do recommend it.
3,hood hat,"I received this product, but it looks nothing like the picture, very disappointed. I wanted a complete hooded hat so hair would not get wet like in snowy conditions. Hat is also to small. I have bought other products from amazon, first time not happy with product"
2,Disappointing follow-up,"When I first heard the Virgin-Whore Complex release, ""Stay Away from my Mother"" I was absolutely hooked. I'm a college student and my friends and I would sit in the room and sing along with songs like ""Anyway"" ""Discovered"" ""Revolver"" or ""Wise and Mighty Emperor"". Such biting lyrics about homophobics and religious fanatics and narcissistic rockers. ""Succumb"" is extremely disappointing. In a sense, the band did seem to ""succumb."" The songs here lack the biting, offensive lyrics and seem to lack a lot of intelligence as well. The musicality has gone downhill with everything else. If you ever have the chance to buy ""Stay Away from my Mother"" (at this point, you have to write a letter to Emperor Norton to do so) you should definitely do so. And if you love it, you probably won't like ""Succumb"" too much."
5,Can't find anything to complain about!,"Bought this book to begin sausage making. I have enjoyed the read and the recipes. So far, i have tried the Brats, Iowa Farm Sausage and the Sweet Italian. Best I have ever had. I have a few more recipes I am goign to make, but I figured cooking three, and having great success, was worth writing about."
1,Loser,Well it's my belief that if I really don't get someones ideas I'm usually beingBS ed in some way and that's the case here. I'm unimpressed with theabstractions presented and particularly unimpressed with the interrelations.I was conned into buying it by the reviewers. Yes I slogged thru the wholething (author can write) and while it may have some particular appeal if u r gay or Jewishotherwise forget this one. Comparisons to Morgan's work are jokes.Robert Yoho
2,needs a textbook,"It has only CDs and no textbook and it is hard to figure out the pronunciation without a written text. I could not figure out whether they were saying ""m"" or ""n"", ""p"" or ""b"", and was lost in all variants of ""sh"" and ""ch"". A short print out with corresponding phonetic symbols for each word would have solved many of my problems. I had to spend hours with Chinese dictionary searching for translations and I could not find many of the words that they used."
5,"Outstanding, like all the Pimsleur sets","Mandarin is an incredibly complex language, and anyone who has tried 'travel phrase' type programs will understand why those wont work. If you're looking for a conversant proficiency in 4-5 hours - FORGET IT!! After the 8 hours (really 24 or so if you're listening to each lesson several times and moving one lesson a day.) You will be able to apologize correctly for the atrocities you are committing on the 'peoples language'. It is doubtful that you will understand much from a conversation between two native-speakers, but you will be light-years ahead of the 'travel-tape' crowd. Most of all, you will make sufficient progress to earn the respect of those who speak this extremely difficult (for occidentals) language. All this I say by way of discourse, to encourage reasonable expectations. Anyone with reasonable expectations will be thrilled with the Pimsleur series."
5,excellent!,excellent! this is a good speed for learning. I highly recommend it. Each lesson build and reinforces previous lessons. Pronuciation is emphasized. Tone is extremely important in Mandarin. I work with Native Chineese; they comment on how well I pronouce.
5,The Moving of Toxic Mojo,"This album is a kicker! I discovered this little known band on a trip through East Tennessee. I am excited ... has found it too. Toxic Mojo is a version of the new techno and the old disco styles of music. The album has a great beat and is a really cool dance album. It fits the club scene PERFECT. It makes you want to get your booty up and dance all night. It is the kind of album you want to listen to over and over! All the songs are extended for dancing. The best of the album are the first two songs: ""Bach Goes Tech"" and ""Wild Island nights"". I brought the album to my favorite dance club and ask the DJ to play it. Not to my surprise, everyone kept requesting the album be played over and over all night long! It plays good on a heavy bass system or even a loud system with less bass. The only complaint I have is my mom keeps stealing it to listen to as she exercises! Way to Go Dr. Duke Band--Toxic Mojo is a winner. Can't wait to here your next release!"
1,Very disappointing,"I should have listened more to the reviews about the sound. Although the ear buds fit my ears nicely the very tin-can sound is unbearable. As far at the self-winding cord is concerned, it's not worth it. The cord frequently does not wind all the way back in to the holder. All in all, a terrible waste of $12.58. I, too, think that one star is too high when rating this product."
3,50 Harbor Street,I have enjoyed her books in the past. This wasn't one of the best. Too many characters to follow and it got confusing.
2,50 Harbor Street,"I was disappointed in this book, after reading A Good Yarn, this one fell flat on it's face. The ending was no ending at all, leaving a character POSSIBLY going to jail.It was as if another writer wrote this book."
3,I enjoyed the story but.....................,"I really liked the story of Corrie and Roy but the whole book skipping from nieghbor to neighbor by chapters, I found to be irritating. As one reviewer wrote, ""the book was disjointed"". Hopefully authors will realize that the reader wants to story to flow. This is why I quit reading the James Patterson series of books. I just don't like chopped up stories.That is my humble opinion."
2,50 Harbor St.,I thought I was buying a book on CD. I have donated this book to the local library. Not clear on site that it was a paperback book.
5,A Must Have for Pearl Jam Fans,"I've always loved Pearl Jam but I am older than they are and didn't follow them closely during their rise. This video is really entertaining as well as informative about their career, with insights to the controversies, personnel issues, writing and artistry, performances and much more. Highly recommend it as a Rockumentary."
5,Excellent Face-Paced story.,"This story is written in the same style of the television series and is one of the best in the series. Mark Morris captures the Fifth Doctor's personality quite well and it was nice to see UNIT back in action. This time with the fifth Doctor instead of the third. The story contains plenty of action, drama, and horror that made the book hard to put down."
4,more 90's than the 90's,"There is something so quintessentially nineties about this album. Can't even say why; it sounds more nineties than many actual nineties albums I can think of. I mean this in a good way. There's a whole element of guitar-y pop in the nineties that was great. This one is somewhere between pop and rock and it circles entirely around the guitar. It's got little elements of shoegazery noise in it but no more than any nineties guitar pop had. Fun with teenagery passion that makes one more nostalgic than genuinely impassioned. Annie's got a limited voice but I like it just fine, it fits and is expressive at times and at all times radiates a likable persona. Slayer's the best track, but I also immediately liked the first two tracks, and eventually I liked them all."
4,Smaller than I expected,"These tongs are a nice weight. They measure about 3 3/4"" from end to end, making them smaller than I expected. Read the product reviews carefully to be sure that this is the right size for your needs. They would work perfectly in a small sugar server with cubes of sugar. They would not work well as an hors d'oeuvre server, as their diminutive size cause them to get lost in most serving dishes."
4,Keisha,"I liked this title - - it wasn't TCP's best but it was entertaining. To be fair to the author, I didn't think the grammar was awful, definitely showed improvement. To the last reviewer, don't you mean some sentences didn't make ""sense""? Maybe you aren't quite sure how to spell, either..."
2,Video Quality Suspect,"This copy of SOLDIER IN THE RAIN has somewhat lower than expected video quality. I suspect that this DVD may have been made by copying from a VHS tape, but I cannot say for sure. The quality is maybe a little better than the pre-recorded VHS tape that I have.Anyways, I love McQueen and Gleason, and I've always thought that botgh of these guys were underrated as actors. SOLDIER IN THE RAIN is a wonderful movie - 5 stars. The 2 star rating for this product is because of the low video quality. I wish that whoever mastered this DVD had taken more pride in their work. Oh well..."
4,I loved it more when I saw it in the '60s,"But it was still a beautiful, elegiac piece with spare, gorgeous acting by Jackie Gleason and Steve McQueen. And the soundtrack!!! Wow!"
1,A WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY!,THE MATH SECTION DOES NOT EVEN BEGIN TO COMPARE TO THE TRUE EXAM. THE TEST IS MORE COMPLEX. THE MATH (COMPLEX LINEAR EQUATIONS) ARE ACTUALLY QUESTIONS WITHIN A QUESTION. SOMEONE NEEDS TO COME OUT WITH THE REAL DEAL BOOK ON HOW TO PASS THIS TEST.
1,Too easy,This book has the same basic structure as the exam but is much much easier than the actual test. Won't help much- practice your math instead!
3,Blade change gets 2 thumbs down.,"I bought this to replace the crummy B&D jig saw I had. I spent an hour working with the blade change system. I folowed the instructions in the manual and found the procedure to be cumbersome and illogical. After the first time, I didn't hear the ""clicks"" at the right times anymore. I returned it and got the Bosch 1590. Push a lever and slide the blade in. Push the lever again and the blade pops out. Why Bosch uses such an absurd blade change system on the 1587 is beyond me."
2,improbably awkward,"A solid German tool with a very un-German blade change mechanism: elaborate and fraught with failure points. In a noisy shop, you can't hear the little detent set; if you are in a hurry, you sometimes don't feel it either. Then the plastic knob breaks off in your hand. Full disclosure: if you are the kind of person who doesn't carefully read all the instructions first, it is easy to break it while trying, with increasing force, to lock the blade.Why all this spinning and clicking anyway. Compare to the Milwaukee Sawzall: quarter turn locked, quarter turn unlocked, never fails under a lot more stress than a jigsaw might encounter.The bevel adjustment is equally awkward, though not likely to break.Someone else may know if there is a better Jig saw out there. If not, you may want keep a half-dozen plastic blade-retainer rotary knobs on hand as I do."
3,accountant62,"Smooth running, excellent saw, BUT blade changes are always an adventure and the base plate attachment is junk. I can live with the blade changes. How many turns? Is the top pulled up enough? Eventually you get the old blade out. But I am on my 3rd base plate. It is held on by one large allen head screw which sits in a cross shaped slot for adjusting forwards and backwards and to the left and right for angles. The metal at the intersections of the cross breaks and then you are out another $17 plus shipping."
4,quirky and cool,"This oddity provides constant surprises. Beginning with a very standard and cliched plot - the heroine must return to claim her accursed homestead - it is full of enough biblical and fundamental Christian perspective to make me wonder whether it was from a religious publisher. Yet it manages to be pretty creepy, and the ending is a real surprise, in my opinion, given the initial tenor of the tale. Decently written, kept me turning pages through it's simple plot with scary episodes. A step above ordinary cheesy horror."
4,TRENDnet Modem,Works with Linux. Lots of blinking lights.Hard to release the RJ-11 jack once you've snapped it in.
5,Flawless performance,"I have used the TFM-560X V.92 for 3 months with no problems. Web speed test shows 48k connect. I use it about 2-3hrs a day, always connects with no dropped calls, yet. Simple driver install, had it running in 5min. Excellent performance for an external 56k hardware based modem."
3,Resurrection film review,"Resurrection is a good film, very appropriate for Easter. The overall production is not as slick as a big budget film but it is definitely worth seeing. I would welcome more films like this from Lucado, who is an excellent author and speaker."
5,tony hawks pro skater,"This is the best game I ever played for playstation, thrasher seems like the barbie game compared to this you can pull awsome tricks and things that would be immposible in real life, which make it all the better."
5,The Best Game Ever!,"I have had this game since Christmas! I haven't put it down. Cool graphics! I would recommend that if you purchase this game for a teenager, remind him/her that they need a helmet and pads in real life."
3,shame on tony,"man did i have fun playing this game for about two months.i played it everyday.i never got tired of it.if i reviewed this game two months ago i would have gave it 10 stars.then i realized (i do skate so i know about this stuff) that the tricks are very limited (i realized this when i first played it, but it really hit me this time).i got really tired of it.the graphics are great and being able to be kareem campbell topped it off.then thrasher came out and blew this game away(you could see my review on thrasher if you want).i'll talk about thrasher in my thrasher review.but the music was bad on tony hawk, what he needed was some hip-hop like thrasher.and way more tricks.you cant even do frontside k-grinds! and frontside smith grinds right! or manuals! or nollie tricks right! if you want a skate game and have to choose between thrasher or tony hawhk get thrasher.and one more thing tony hawk is ways to easy,thrashe gives me a challenge."
1,"Messy structure, not helpful at all","I concur with the first two reviewers that the structure of this book leaves much to be desired. It lacks a good overview of the options and dives into extreme details where inappropriate.An example: I want to replicate the sample site used in the book. The so-called soft links don't work and instead point to a German site. Eventually I found the files in English, but nobody thought about adding a simple read me file how to import the template.I feel I probably better had stuck with the online documentation..."
4,Great Database Book,This book is great for people just beginning to learn about databases. A must have for people who want to learn more about databases and/or want to be database administrators.
5,Native Americans,"Ths book is rightly regarded as one of,if not the most well informed sources of information with regard to native American peoples."
4,Not too shabby,"I felt the book, although lagging at some parts, was over all a good read. I say if you are a Disney Nut, get it!"
1,save your money,I am experiencing morning/noon/afternoon sickness at 14 weeks. People raved about them so I made a purchase after reading several reviews and friends saying how great they worked (mostly hearsay). Two days before purchasing them I sucked a Lifesaver. I will have to say that not only did the pops not work on the days I have used them I actually have the continuing sick feeling and vomit on top of that. I sure they work for some people but you can get the same effect a lot cheaper with a Lifesaver.
1,"Does not help, some tastes terrible","These didn't come close to helping me. Not only that, but most of them tasted terribly. B-Natals were slightly more helpful, and Morning Wellness Tea by Earth Mama Angel Baby was the most helpful. All in all, nothing will make bad morning sickness magically disappear, but these Preggie Pops? Worthless."
2,"Lots of grizzle, not much steak.","As a fellow alumni of the same university (Tufts) I was more than casually interested in the author's career path. That alone, however, was insufficient to sustain my continued engagement. To a reader with no affiliation with the author, interest would wane even faster. No smoking guns, no interesting quotes by someone other than the author. The entire book could be summarized in two sentences, ""Mr. Kuo was extremely disheartended that George W. Bush played the religious right like a fiddle for their political support without giving them much in return. Yet, in conflict with everything he has written, the author still believes that W.'s religious faith is genuine."" Go figure."
3,A good start,"After reading David Kuo's ""Tempting Faith"" one gets a number of impressions...he's sincere and young, to name just a couple. The premise of the book, exposing those in the Christian community and their influence in White House politics and policy is nicely exposed by Kuo, but my feeling is that he stayed just long enough to write a book. He's a couple of beers short of a six-pack as a writer, though I like his argument.There have been many books more critical of Bush and company over the past few months, but this is not particularly one of them. ""Tempting Faith"" takes a long time to get into. The Bushies have plenty to answer for and David Kuo has done a good job....I wish this book had been less self-serving and more revealing."
5,"informative, easy read","David Kuo is a good read for those who are not high tech readers, as I am not. I appreciated his Christian perspective, as it was honest, compassionate and truthful from his point of reference. It was interesting and disheartening to learn how people of good intention give up their integrity to get votes for themselves or their party. It was inspirational to me, though, because I felt connected to people I will never meet and are so ""high up"" in the government, based on our similar human desire to help those in need. I am not a right wing republican, but I was able to see our common god-spirit. David, you are a gifted writer and an honorable man. Thank you for writing this book."
3,Very hard to find aftermarket parts.,I agree with the last reviewer 100%. I looked near and far for template guides so I could route out the hinges on some doors I was hanging. This tool would be ideal for the light routing work involved. I looked everywhere for template guides. The manual stated that the same guides that can be used on the 1600 series routers could be used on this trimmer. No universal guides would fit so I went to an authorized Bosch distributor to get them. Even the guides that the employees told me would work did not work. I had little choice but to go out and purchase a new router that could do the job and that had the accessories available. The quality of this trimmer is 5 stars all the way. The accessories are what keeps it from being great all around.
1,Not worth the money.....,"We are enjoying a wondeful week in Iceland and bought the book as useful pocket guice. Not worth the money. Any of the free guides available at the airport or hotels have more accurate info. For example, the guide on p106 mentions an angelica schnapps, Hvannarotar which is not available at any restaurant or liquor shop in the city of Reykjavik.A muchbetter buy to learn about the country is ""Waking Up in Iceland"" that weaves < marvelous tale around the music industry while giving tourism advice, history and a good read.In the future, I will stick with Frommers, Lonely Planet or other better guides."
3,Bosch Finecut Handsaw,I returned this item. Was able to get the entire kit with Casecheaper than here.
5,Totally Happening CD,If you haven't heard this band your really missing out. Particularily Mark Stanley's guitar work is astonishing. From growling distortion to clean jazz lines Mark is showing a new direction for 21st century guitarists. The bands blend of styles is truely unique. I highly recommend you check this out!!!
4,Wiggles DVD,"It is a little slower than most Wiggles songs we were used to so my 3 year old wasn't a fan, but my 1 1/2 year old didn't seem to mind."
3,not as good as expected or as their previous DVDs.,"I feel my son is a little disappointed with this DVD. He is a big fan and has all Wiggles toys and almost all DVDs. The previous DVD was a big success and he loved so I assumed this one was going to be as good. Unfortunately, it is not. The music is just not exciting, the dances are not very entertaining. Let's face it, the Wiggles are getting old..."
3,"Good, but not as good as CD's","The major limiting factor to an MP3 player is that it, well, has to run MP3's. The problem with this is that the MP3 is a compressed sound format. That is, even if you are recording from your CD's to MP3's, you are losing sound quality, which is very noticable on choral or vocal-intense songs. If what you are looking for is something to listen to while you jog or rollerblade, this product is for you. However, if you want to read a book while listening or just listen to music without distractions, the sound difference is easy to hear. The technology has come a long way, but the MP3 will never be able to rival CD quality sound."
1,This dog won't hunt.,"I bought the F20V with high hopes and now wish I'd read the oneguy's review who said he wasn't an Eigerlabs ""plant"". Thismay be the greatest MP3 player known to man, but I'll never know; I've tried 6 different parallel port settings on a computer and port with which I've previously had zero difficulty. The net result is not a damned thing - I can't get the player to upload any MP3 files, Eigerlabs tech support won't respond to my e-mail or calls, and I'll be happy if PC Nation refunds my money so I can buy a player that connects via USB. Stay...away from the F20V. END"
3,"It'd be nice, I suspect. If it WORKED.","Okay, so I'm bitter. But after jumping through two hours' worth of hoops trying to configure my system, the MPMan F20 still refuses to be recognized by the software it came with. Seems like poor design. I'm giving it an average star rating until their tech support gets back to me - after that, even if it works there's no way it deserves a 5. Too much frustration."
2,Easy reader edition of Performance Improvement,"Story line is a bit hokey; too much story line, not enough technical information.Although the three levels of performance level ""needs"" were identified, I never got the feeling that they were aligned with each other. Book is light on the cause analysis. The highest level: Business Goals is missing entirely. Moreover, the book ended with the ""capability needs"" not solidly aligning with business needs. They were identified, yes, but not aligned.Another area of concern is the inappropriate method of prioritizing solutions. Blanchard's story characters went back to the floor to prioritize, should have gone back to the business goal & objectives."
5,This stuff smells great!!!,"I have the sample already and I'm looking for a full size bottle.I'm a cologne guy,I love it and so does my fiancee'!!!let me start by saying I can't break it down into adjectives by saying stuff like woody,refreshing though that's a close one,I can however say I have lot's of cologne and know what I like and don't in fact here' a list...Lucky,luckyno.6,Curve,Crush, Wave,Chill,Soul(all curve variations)Perry Ellis 360 Red & Blue,Polo sport, Nautica,Nautica Voyage,Eternity,Candies,Lacoste red & black,Cool Water,Bora Bora,Victoria's Secret very sexy for men,Estee Lauder pleasures,Chrome,Issey Miyagi,Tommy and tommy jeans,and a few others.So I know my smells and this stuff is one of my favorites and women always compliment me on it too.I won't do like some of the other cologne reviewers who ignorantly say stuff like it turns women on or whatever but they do like the smell.It's good stuff."
3,Good but not great advice for wardrobe building,"This Chic Simple book is written for those who have a closetful of clothes but nothing ever to wear. It helps women pull together a total wardrobe and focuses on such key elements as:*style*elements of clothing (color, fabric, texture)*clothes (underwear,outerwear,suits etc)*care of clothes*definitions/glossary of fashion jargonThe book is very well illustrated with full color pictures and drawing. It does not give specific advice and seems to be written more for those in the clothing business/fashion designers. But overall, i enjoyed this book."
3,"Good, but not as specific as I was looking for","This is a good book if you often, as I am, finding yourself at sea either in clothing stores or in your own closet. It gives you an idea for a basic wardrobe on which to build, and then ideas for special occasions.What I didn't like about the book is that it didn't have enough of the basic, this is what you should buy information. It talked a lot about types of fabrics and cuts, and things only fashion designers need to know. It is set up more like a coffee table book than a how-to."
5,Eminently Useful Book,"This is an eminently useful book. The style is timeless and there are excellent descriptions of the qualities of different fabrics (and tips on getting out stains). It also covers what to wear in London, New York, San Francisco, on a plane, etc. You need this for your reference shelf."
3,Some good information,"There is some good diet tips in this book and a lot of information you don't need to know, like how your body digests food. I wish there were more tips and motivation then the science behind it."
2,For inexperienced dieters only,"The book basically tells us what experienced dieters already know. Stay away from processed foods, sugar, fat, and so on. Eat more fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and fish. Eat smaller meals more often (6) rather than a few larger ones (3). Exercise; aerobic (walking) and strength training (weights or bands). He states eat less calories and burn more through exercise. If you have ever dieted before you know this already. The book with the images and factoids seemed like a book I would have read in grade school. The positives; it told you some foods that were good for different parts of your body, such as tomatoes are good for the skin, etc. There were a few good recipes. But you could get this information on the internet, rather then spending the money on the book."
5,You: On a Diet: The Owners Manual for Waist Management,"An easy to read, easy to understand diet book that focuses on waist management instead of weight loss. In other words forget about the scale and concentrate on the size of your waist. While the book includes detailed explanations of the digestive process, its fundamental approach is to avoid simple sugars, products made from whole milk or bleached flour. A great book for anyone serious about changing his/her body profile, by altering eating habits in a sensible way--coupled with a daily exercise regimen."
2,Ehh could have been better,Not at all what I expected.The information is good and easy to follow but the cartoon drawings lack seriousness. Kind of annoying.
2,Not what I really expect it to be.,"Well I own alot of self help books and diet books as well ( I know pretty sad).. But I did not really like this one.. I thought it is sopposed to guide you because it says manual, but as I was reading it was just base in facts and what people went through.. Anyway I didn't really like the book, but I guess it might work for others"
5,Great book!,I have bought this book for many friends and they all said that they have found it quite useful. I recommend it to everyone!
3,Clever but confusing!,The book is illustrated a bit cutsy but the information is good. I did find it very confusing - as I tried to make my shopping list. The one in the book does not include the main meal ingredients. I find myself having to shuffle around to get the meal plan - too many places to look. I plan to start nest week so can't say anything about the program success yet. It has taken me longer to prepare than I planned. It is wounderful that I can have chocolate and a glass of winehowever!
3,TEDIOUS!,"THIS COULD HAVE BEEN A REALLY GOOD 100 PAGE BOOK, INSTEAD IT WAS A TEDIOUS READ AT 300 PAGES. THE FIRST 170 PAGES WERE ABOUT THE ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY OF DIGESTION. SOME OF THIS WAS VERY INTERESTING AND RELATIVE BUT COULD HAVE BEEN CONDENSED INTO ABOUT 20 PAGES. I ALSO HAD TROUBLE WITH THE WRITING. ADDING SOME LIGHTHEARTED LEVITY TO AN OTHERWISE DRY SUBJECT IS A GOOD THING BUT THEY THREW A STUPID JOKE INTO EVERY PARAGRAPH. IT FELT INSULTING TO ME AFTER AWHILE. I REALLY ENJOY THEIR SHOWS ON OPRAH BUT CANNOT RECOMMEND THIS BOOK."
5,Buy the Book - Excellent,"If you ever wanted to know how the body works, buy this book. If you thought you understood why members of your family operate this way and some operate that way, buy the book. If I could have read this book before I had Biology 101, I would have understood a lot more. Again, buy the book. I can't recall reading a book that don't break the simple down like this. Buy the book....."
3,Take the Advice from Book with a Grain of Salt,"I think there is a lot of sound advice in the book and I find it interesting to learn how your body uses food but there are a bunch of things in the book that raised an eyebrow with me.It claims that your deodorant might be causing you to be fat and that sounds like a load of hooey to me.It also claims that cinnamon will help you loose weight and that is unfounded scientifically.There is really only one way to loose weight, and that is to burn off more calories then you consume."
1,"Another fad diet book, woopty-freaking-doo!",Another fad diet book with attractively packaged and with a catchy title. This is the most original book to hit the shelves in years. If you don't want to have to buy tripe like this here's a tip: Don't get fat in the first place! If you're already stuck being fat then buy Kevin Trudeau's books he has the real insider secrets that will make you skinny and healthy!
1,zzzzzzzzzzzzzzz,I like Dr. Oz so I picked this book up at the library and dove in to it. It kept repeating the same thing over and over. We know you tried to diet and exercise before but you don't have good will power. It went on like this for many pages. I give up. I'm so glad I didn't buy this book.
4,Good biology for everyone,"I read on another site where doctors of various types and backgrounds had mostly said this book was very poor. I found that, after reading the book, their reviews were based on reading the dust cover - not actually reading the book. While the biology has been made simpler in some ways, it's actually pretty detailed for most people. In fact, in some cases it might be a little hard to follow. And while I love the quips and the little flippy remarks, I find them annoying now that I'm at the end of the book. It has helped me be able to find some parts of my self that were lost or seemed confusing. I think that everyone who has struggled with diets for years should read it - especially if they are not aware of the biology and psychology of their bodies. We're pretty hard on ourselves and this helps us understand why and advocates a much healthier way of eating and BEING that is very, very good. I do recommend it."
4,Good Resource on how to make a lifestyle change,"Dr. Oz and Dr Roizen's You: On a Diet is simple and straightforward, but I think many will find their plan difficult.I purchased the book and thoroughly enjoyed the writing style. The authors use a good amount of humour and practic advise to keep you interested while still being informative. I decided to try the plan and found it was difficult to follow. I actually could not find any bread without high fructose corn syrup in it, for example. This being said, this is sound advise on how to make a lifestyle change and would be made even simpler if you did what most people know, eat whole foods and avoid processed.I am most fond of the exercises suggested as they do not require any equipment and ther doc's strong suggestion of daily walking.All in all this is a great resource but will be difficult for the harried American to follow. I continue to use their advise but for losing weight I will go back to a more tradition program of counting calories myself."
4,You on a Diet,I think this book is very informative. Easy to understand. Helpful and very humorous. Lets you laugh at yourself and what you thought about dieting and at the same time educates you with a very enjoyable text.
4,For those who know everything about dieting...,"I'll admit it, saw him on Oprah...yes that is right, a stay at home mom and I watched Oprah. Big surprise there? Well I bit and bought the book. Read the whole thing too. Even though I was pained at the attempts at humor, I got thru it. Kinda boring, but refreshing to see no magic pill, or hocus pocus diet. I thought I knew it all...okay learned a few things. Decided to just get with it... I joined the Y and stopped thinking about food. Just started eating what was good for me. Ok you want the nuts and bolts...I lost the inches and the lbs...sorry Dr I still watch the scale...6 weeks 10 lbs. Haven't had time to watch a single Oprah since. So the pluses just keep adding up.So if you want the quick version here it is...Find something other than food to make you happy. Get off the couch and take a walk and eat a handful of walnuts 20 minutes before lunch.So how did I do?"
4,Educational,"Very plain, simple language. Easily understood. Makes very great points regarding what your eating, why, what it does, how body functions, etc. Makes you think before you pop anything into your mouth!"
2,Vegetarian beware,"Any diet book that doesnt have ""vegetarian"" in the index isless than worthless as it's also insulting :-)"
1,You: On a Diet,Don't know why I got this - but gave it away soon after reading some of it. Don't get it - don't know how it got published. Wouldn't ever get it again.
4,"You, Me, Them, All of US Looking for the right diet",Very informative book about digestion and how the body metabolizes food. Funny thing though I didnt lose much weight with this diet and I followed it to a T for a month. I ate more fiber rich foods than I have in my entire life and did not get much benefit except for being VERY regular. I have lost 15 lbs so far... 3 weeks in on the Atkins plan. I guess everyone just has a diet that works best for them.
3,This book took to long to make a point,"This book gives good information with far too many words. They could cut this book in half and I would recommend it. The authors mix facts in with silly analogies that are not humorous. I found it distracting from the actual topic. It made me wonder if they ever really worked with overweight women. The jokes they made were insensitive and assumed that people have little self control. If you like goofy one liners, you will love this book. I like the facts, some case studies and a few stories. The data was very good. I would suggest buying it used. Now when they create a road map of the book with the data and facts, it will be a good resource to those of us who help people lose weight."
2,Save Your Money,This book explains nothing more that what we already know - eat healthier and exercise.
2,"View of another nutrition writer, Ira Edwards","YOU ON A DIET is a good source for study of nutritional physiology. It is not so good for biochemistry. The humor-by-gross-exaggeration might be confusing for some, tiresome for others. For healthful information you can so better with books by Ron Rosedale or Al Sears. After studying nutrition intensively for several years, I find few really useful books. HONEST NUTRITION is more useful than YOU ON A DIET."
5,Awesome Book. I learned a lot and lost a ton!,"I have lost 60 pounds and kept it off for a long time, using a well known dieting club, and tapping into information from dieting books. This one is becomming one of my favorite sources because I find things in here that I have never heard before. I love it. I also want to tell people trying to lose weight that I have tried many times before, even went to a hypnotherapist. Nothing worked until I read an amazing book called *Effortless Wellbeing* by Evan Finer. I don't know exactly why, since that is not a diet book, but after reading and doing what was in that book, I was finally able to make big great changes in my life in many areas. I finally was able to diet successfully and use all of the information in books like YOU. Don't miss this one because it really has unbelievable and effective information."
3,TMI (Too much information),"These two doctors are most respected in their fields.But it seems that the first half of this book provides too much information about our bodies and how we process the food we eat.Granted, this is important , however, it is a bit more information than I was willing to take the time to read.I found the presentation of the diet in the second half of the book tedius. Most of this is common sense and follows the basic rules of good nutrition and exercise."
5,my review,There are some great things in this book and you can definietly learn and grow from reading it!!
5,Great Inspiration!!!!,"God lead me to purchase this collection of worship songs uplifting His name and showing me that as you focus on Him you shall move mountains.A worthwhile purchase for anyone needing to wallow in God's presence, I listen to it every single day!!!"
5,Excellent - Symphony #7,"This is one of those pieces of music that I only learned about by surfing Amazon. Rautavaara's Symphony #7 deserves all the acclaims it has received from other reviewers. It is beautiful, original, and worthwhile. What's interesting is that if I had to characterize this symphony, it strikes me as a cross between Sibelius and (believe it or not) Vaughan Williams, particularly his Symphony #7 (Sinfonia Antarctica). In fact, I actually hear more of the Sinfonia Antarctica in this music than anything else--more in the sound-world that the symphony creates, as well as the spatial effects and sense of timelessness. It's excellent, and well worth adding to your collection."
4,Empowerment,"I read the book with great interest both from a prepective of learning about a potential enviromental violation and how local and even state and federal regulators viewed this sitition. I became more enamered in how a community and some strong leadership emerged in a community to deal with forces who did not want to recognoze that the local citizenry should or could get involed. The strength of the author and others in the community became evident as I continued to read. To walk with them as these various strengths began to develop or rather manifest themselves as they deal with unfamiliar forces was thrilling and uplifting. We read all the time how individuals draw on untapped reserves of strength but seldom do we hear of entire communities doing so. Great book, exciting story and I hope to see more of Ms Varlamoff.Kenneth L. Turner"
5,Ever fabulous Tito Puente,I just can't get enough of Tito Puente. I first saw him about forty-five years ago and I will never forget him
3,Great Pictures,"D'Aulaire makes wonderful images of the Aesir and Vanir, perfect for a very small child who is beginning to learn of the Gods. The book's primary disappointment is the unfortunately heavy Christian bias of the work (she infers that we are post-Ragnarok, and that the White Christ is now the leader of the new world), D'Aulaire probably never anticipated that there might be Teutonic, Norse Pagans and Asatru out there looking for good books for their children. Also, the scholarship behind the work is out of date, and more than that, wrong. But it IS a children's book, and is good for younger kin if you can ignore the bias, which is mostly toward the end. The pictures are wonderful, and no matter how Bowdlerized the story, they are the most cheerful color drawings of the Gods I've yet seen. They are Vanish in their radiance, and Lokish in their whimsical smiles"
1,The journies of NG&G: The worst book I have ever read!,This book is about different journies mythological characters take. I had to read this book in English class and I thought it was horrible. I don't suggest it to people who don't like to read classics or fantasy books!
5,Makes you put your life into perspective!,"Lou Stoops has done a masterful job here. He really helps you to think about what is really important in life, and guides you on how to be SHARP! I feel that I am a much happier and more productive person after reading Lou's book and taking it to heart."
1,awful,"I have to say I was very disappointed in this book. I didn't like Alisoun or David. While a lot of other reviewers felt that Alisoun was too cold for David, I felt that they deserved each other - they were both stupid.Basically, my recommendation is to skip this book, but if you are a huge Dodd fan, check it out from the library. I know a lot of other reviewers loved this book - so I guess it is worth checking out from the library or borrowing to see if you like it. If you haven't read Dodd before, don't start with this one - most of her other books are very good."
4,I thought this was a cute story - very entertaining,I liked it because the primary characters were very human. He was a beaten up warrior who had aches and pains and vices. He didn't know it all and definetly didn't want to be it all...he wasn't on a power trip like most heros in this type of book. Very refreshing. I especially like the part where she accidently killed the goose. What a hoot!
4,Getting back to Grape Basics.,"Lon Rombough's new book ""The Grape Grower"" is an excellent resource for those who want to work with Mother Nature as much as possible when growing grapes instead of always trying to fight her. In place of synthetic pesticides, fungicides, insecticides, etc., Mr. Lombough presents healthier agronomic practices for aquiring beautiful grapes. His promotion of private breeding of new grape varieties is also most noble. I've only been growing grapes for four years but have personally witnessed the validity of his recommendations in my own vineyard. JB"
5,excellent,"""Tryin'"" was an absoultely great read. I found myself unable to put this book down. I even went as far as hiding it in my desk drawer at work (pretending to work) in the open position so that I could continue to read. It made me very happy to see Gayle & Pat overcome the obstacles placed before them by going their separate ways in life and resume the special friendship they once shared. BEST friends are very, very rare -- we must always treasure our friendships!"
5,Don't pass this one by......,"I started using audio books as a way to pass the time on my long commute to and from work; this being the fourth book that I purchased. I never expected to be so totally engrossed and entertained. I often found myself sitting in my vehicle after arriving at my destination just to hear a bit more. The story is riveting and the characters unforgettable. I have friends lined up wanting to borrow it....it's a must ""hear""!"
5,WAY TO GOOD TO PUT DOWN OR LET GO!,"I don't have to tell you how great this book is. Let me just say that the moment I met these characters, I became apart of their lives. I saw myself in them. I flew inside the manuscript. These authors definitely did their homework because this is a book that anyone can enjoy. Don't take my word for it. This book speaks for itself. Job well done to Deberry and Grant. I am eagerly awaiting you next novel."
5,Finding yourself,"I read this book for a book club and I love it. This book had me laughing on the train coming home from work and people looking at me like I was crazy. Pat and Gayle was good friend and had very different personalities. Pat was more worried about her future, when Gayle was more worried about getting married and not having to work. As they grow older they grow apart. But with Gayle losing everything it brought them back together. It also show how a women should never put all the trust in men as far as your financial situation, because clearly you could be left with nothing. If you have read this book yet please do you would love it."
3,Nice Light Read,"This book is what I call a bathtub book. Not to say that it isn't interesting--but it lacks depth. Still, it entertains and I couldn't help but be endeared by the friendship that is the center of it. It isn't cerebral, and it won't change your life, but you will read it probably in a day."
4,Enjoying the book,In depth study if the Jewish feasts according to the Bible. The book points to the fulfillment of the feasts and their role in prophecy and Gods timeline.
1,Great concept - Poor execution,"Sounded great to me, but don't try to suck up those great turkey drippings from the bottom of the pan. Gets clogged very easily, then when you squeeze it to empty, it spurts out all over the place...not nice to have hot oily juice on the loose in the holiday kitchen. So,how about using it without the tip...not nice either. Won't hold the contents in. I guess you could say that this baster really sucks, but not in the way it should."
5,Norpro Steel Baster,"After melting even the 'good' silicon tip basters syphoning off bacon fat, I found this Norpro Stainless Steel baster.Withstands everything so far, easy to clean... I don't even see a way to break it!Worth the money for this often used item!"
5,The one book to own,Dr Freeman is the leading voice on the subject.This is the one book recommended to us by our doctor. It is the one you should buy.
5,We Want a Reprint!,"This book is a MUST for any Dune fan. The articles and entries are suburb and insightful, giving much information only touched upon in the novels. Sadly, I lost my copy dyring a flood, and have been searching high and low for another ever since.Mr.McNelly has given us a grand addition to the Dune Universe, and for that, we fans of Dune humbly thank you."
5,REPRINT,"I have never read the book, but i hope that someone will print this fantasic book again, so i can get a copy..."
5,"Help, I lost my copy and i need a reprint!!!","not only does this book cover the main subjects and characters in what has to be one of the most intricate and involved future histories ever written, but it provides essential and indispensable background for the entire expanse of that history and makes it as real as any fictional universe can be. I had a copy of this book before it went out of print, and somewhere in my many moves lost it. I cry over that at least once a week, and think relying on out of print copies at high prices shouldn't be my only answer. Considering the popularity of the Dune universe, and Herbert's son continuing to chronicle the events within it, is resurrecting this reference work such a ridiculous idea?"
2,Waste of Money,"The watch face is decent, but the bands are NOT the color that is pictured in the description. They are actually LIME GREEN, KHAKI, BLACK and not the olive green, khaki and dark brown shown. Because the bands are interchangeable it adds a certain amount of discomfort and an awkward, cheap look when worn. The only color that actually looks presentable with the green face is the lime green band and that is a stretch. Everything else seems to clash and doesn't blend. AVOID THIS ITEM."
1,Not working and wrong product,"We tried to order a watch twice, and they sent us the incorrect watch both times. Additionally, the watch did not come with a working battery."
1,Not practical,Spends about half the book analyzing one game. That equates to at least 30 minutes of analyzing. Even if someone narrows down to one conference that is a lot of time spent in going through the game analysis.
1,You mean you can play the game too?,"I tried changing display drivers and tinkering with the sound and downloading software and switching disks, I even took the game back to the retailer to try a different copy. My PC met all the system requirements on the outside of the box. Why wouldn't the stupid thing work? I emailed tech support and they were no help. And trust me, I've played dozens of games on this PC and never had more than a minor glitch or two. Nothing that a quick patch download couldn't fix. So if you work for NASA or perhaps write game software please buy this game maybe you can fix it. If you have trouble programming a VCR, save your money and just hit yourself in the head with a hammer. You'll end up with the same headache."
4,More Picture Book Than Quilting Instruction,"This book features color pictures of each of the 400 quilts made by The Georgia Quilt Project for the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta, GA. Under each picture it is noted to which country's flag-bearer the quilt was given. The only instructions given are for the quilt that is featured on the cover of the book. I like to flip through the pages and use it as inspiration for new design ideas. It is a great tribute to the dedicated quilters who gave so selflessly of their time and creativity for the Olympics."
1,Crazy prices!!,I'm not sure where this company got there prices from because I just bought this at Walmart for $4.45. I would suggest shopping around before you purchase from JNL.
1,"Good product, very bad delivery","I had ordered two Turduckens from Lima to eat them with my friends in LA. I have ordered two given the expected number of guests for that day. They only sent me one, which was kind of uncomfortable, since more people showed. The turduckhen was great, but it could have been better if served properly and not as appetizer size portions. I am back in Lima and the company would like to send the second turkey o LA as a solution."
1,not worth the money,"My son purchased this toy because he wanted to build his own robots, but when we started to put it together it broke everytime. it was a great idea for a toy , but it is not durable. My son never even got two pieces together. Don't waste your money on it."
3,Just so so,"Although I enjoyed how the author accurately described the lives of the stay home mothers; the book overall was a little dull. First of all there were so many characters introduced that it was hard to keep up. Secondly, the ending was unrealistic. It seemed like the killer was just decided on at the end. I would recommend She Loves Me Not and The Final Fictim over this book."
4,Good but drawn out,This was my second book by this author and it seemed a bit more wordy than needed to be but overall the story and suspense were excellent. Had me guessing until the very end.
2,MISTAKES....to mention only few,"Magi= plural of magus. So there is no ""fourth magi"" (page 233).""What is it"" in Hebrew is ""Ma Ze"" and not ""Ma Na"", neither ""manna"" (pages 207&219).""There are a slew of articles"" (page 211)"
4,Map of Bones review,"Very good book. If you liked DaVinci Code, like history or like reading about special ops groups, you'll like this. Good characters and good intrigue."
3,Map of Bones...just a little too talky!,"Having read all of James Rollins' novels, Map of Bones comes off as a verbose attempt to justify Rollins' intense research into Catholic ritual, history, and dogma. While the basic military action of the story captures the reader's interest, the novel bogs down in the author's attempt to display his research in a clumsy, didactic fashion. If you've ever heard Tim McCarver literally ruin a World Series telecast with irrelvant, decades old minutia, then you'll appreciate how James Rollins should have reduced the history lessons and simply got on with the novel's action, especially as it leads to the climax."
2,Catch a ride on the tails of Da Vinci Code,"This book is hyped on the cover as a ""much better"" read than the Da Vinci code - hogwash. It's so apparent that this book is trying to capitalize on the success of that other book that any reference that can be seen as mildly complimentary in comparision to the Da Vinci Code is going to make it on the cover (or inside leaf) of this wanna be book.The incidents and characters that appear in this book are so unbelievable that at times it's nearly comical. The ability of the heros and heroines to escape through their reasoning and knowledge is beyond credible acceptance and gets to the point where this book is difficult to finish.Don't waste your time on this - it's so far fetched it becomes absurd."
4,A good read!,"It was hard to follow at times, even with a scientific background, but I loved the action and very good descriptions of places."
1,So bad it's not even good.,"A really bad movie sometimes attract a cult following, embracing and reveling in the cheesy plot, the overdone stereotypes and the overabundance of cliches. This book is not that good. Without a glimmer of self irony, it trudges out a plot so stereotypical and inconsistent that it leaves a reader amazed that someone who can write this can also tie his own shoes and send a manuscript to a publisher. I bought it for a dollar at a used book shop and consider it two dollars wasted."
3,Bond with greater intellect,"This was my first Rollins Novel. I started well and continued but somewhere the story slowed my reading. In the last 100 pages I had to work to finish it. I don't know. It was interesting and seemed to flow well with the action parts but maybe the mumbo jumbo parts went overboard and if that is the case I can say thats what happened to me, I have never read or got envolved with science fiction and probably will not. I will read another of his novels to see if this was just a fluk, if not I will be looking for another Author."
4,Finished it in two sittings,"The book is well written and kept me guessing. If you haven't read it yet, make sure you get a copy ofThe Da Vinci Codeas well."
2,"Good, but...","The plot was very interesting, but there were one or two plot twists too many. The characters were well developed, but the raunchy portions were not necessary."
4,Great Book,I loved this book. Kind of a combination between Clive Cussler and Dan Brown. Well written can't wait to read more Sigma Force Novels.
3,"plenty of action, but repetitive","I had a difficult time getting interested in this book, but once I did it was generally entertaining. It is obvious that Rollins did a lot of research and the descriptions of the Bible and historical places are detailed and interesting. The characters are well described and their dialouge is well written. The biggest problem I have with the book is the repetitive action. Basically, the team of good guys looks for clues, races to an historical site, gets ambushed by the bad guys, and somehow escapes with minimal harm. This happens several times in the book and I found it annoying and ridiculous. If you can't find anything better to read, then give this a try."
1,Suspenseful but not much more,"Apparently this book is widely compared to Dan Brown's The Da Vinci Code. This book is perfect for a summer read if you're looking for something with an intense plot and not much else.I was annoyed with the author's attempt to make the book more authentic by using sentences in foreign languages (German, Italian, French, Portuguese). If you do that, at least do it right. Apart from German which I don't speak, there were mistakes in the other languages, the sentences were direct translations from English etc.Even in English, the language is sometimes very stilted and awkward.The flow of the novel is bearable when it comes to the action parts, all the rest sounds unnatural and awkward. The dialogs are huge info dumps and are annoying to read because you constantly try to pretend they sound like real life dialogs. They don't.And if you want a realistic story, this one is not for you. The implausible premise is hard to swallow if you don't have a very vivid imagination."
3,Open when got it,I ordered this product for my wife. She loves puzzles and likes to hold on to some. It holds well and drys fast. however when i got it. It was already opened and had dry glue down the side. But it was less the $5.
3,"Maybe, maybe not","I purchased this glue to permamnently glue a puzzle together so I could hang it on a wall. The glue did bind all of the puzzle pieces together, but after a short time on the wall, the puzzle began to warp. Now it is basically for the trashcan. The problem is that the glue does not set rigidly enough to meet this common purpose. I'm not sure why else one would glue a puzzle, but if you plan to hang it up, then go with a different product."
4,Really good toy i liked it very much,"like i said its very good toy its detailed like in pic's comes with black bag and 1 handed gun, i like it if you are fan of Al Pacino or the movie Scareface .. you should have this on your desk .. shipping was awsome too."
1,Not a good game at all.,"After buying the ER game, I tried to get through my way around, but everytime I kept getting to one point it would freeze."
1,This game would be fun...if it didnt crash all the time,"Don't bother...I was enjoying this game until I received a ""game startup failed"" message, tech support was not much help and suggested I reinstall. NO WAY...I'm not playing the game over again just to get to the spot I crashed at! Its not THAT fun.I'm very disappointed with support and the game and with a little research online, you'll easily find out why. Scores of people have commented on bulletins that this game is full of bugs. Save yourself the time and money."
1,damaged upon arrival,While this looked like the pot I wanted it arrived in a damaged state and I had to return it. It also appeared that this pot had been returned by someone else for the same reason.
4,Rather light weight...,"and I can really tell the difference between it and the Calphalon 'Commercial' line. At $19.95, it was not much of a bargain. I tried to change my erroneous 4-Star rating to 3-Stars, but it could not be edited. This is a nice 'niche' pan for pasta and since it is non-stick, it will likely do adequately for tomato based sauces. Do keep in mind that you need to use low heat. I hope the non-stick coating does better than reviewers of the 'Commercial' line have indicated."
5,Perfect all-purpose pot,This pot is great for almost everything. The size is perfect and it is extremely easy to clean. It feels sturdy yet is not too heavy or unwieldy. My husband uses it constantly.
5,A GREAT CHILI POT,This past weekend I made up a big batch of chili. Everything cooked up really well and the pot was a breeze to wash. I am from the old school and do not place my pots and pans in the dishwasher. The 2 1/2 quart calphalon saucepan I ordered arrived today so I will be using that shortly.
5,A fun Florida mystery with memorable characters!,"Silicone Solution draws you into the steamy world of Tampa society for a murder mystery adventure. Once you start the book, don't expect to put it down until you learn who really committed the crime. Diane Vogt's writing incorporates Hemmingway-esqe description and rich detail about west central Florida, the breast implant industry, and the courts. Enjoy!"
5,it's wonderful,i bought this cd a few days ago because i finally had enough money to. it was either this cd or MCRs enhanced cd but i was like... ooo pretty. that and it was cheaper =]. i got home and uploaded onto my ipod mini. i was with my friends and i decided to listen to a song and i started bobbing my head and a teacher saw i had it out... yeah i still havent gotten my ipod back. but i loved the cd so much. thank god i saved my cd player. you all must buy this cd it's worth a million stars in my book.
4,Finally!!,"I saw this movie when i was a little kid... I remember loving it more than the fox and the hound. I have just spent an hour searching the internet for what it was called, and here i am!!! i bought it just now and i hope that it's all i remembered it to be!!! (that just shows what an impression it made, since i was like 5 when i saw it!)"
1,Korn cd!!!! It has only 3 songs on it!!!,"I just got my cd on the 24th of Oct. I ordered it on the 10th, and then when I opened it, I realized that there are only 3 freakin' songs on it- and i paid $13.99 for it!!!!! I thought it was a WHOLE cd!"
5,The Key to 21st Century Music Production,"I am very pleased with this product. I've been working with FL Studio off and on for about 3 years now. I've completed about 16 beats in 3 weeks. If you wanna make original beats or you want to use samples like 9th Wonder and Khrysis (the 2 hip-hop producers popularized FL Studio),this is the software program for you."
5,GET REAL JNL!!!!!!!,OKAY WE ALL LOVE THE LITTLEST PET SHOP TOYS & PETS. AND I HAVE SEEN THIS SET BEFORE AND IT IS VERY NICE. BUT PEOPLE PLEASE!!!!! DO NOT PAY THIS OUTRAGEOUS PRICE FOR THIS ITEM!!!!! GO TO TOYS R US AND BUY IT THERE INSTEAD. JNL TRADING INFLATES ALLLLLLLLLLL!!!!!!! OF THEIR PRICES! I HONESTLY DON'T KNOW HOW THEY GET PEOPLE TO PAY SUCH RIDICULOUS PRICES. LIKE THE LITTLEST PET SHOP TWIN PANDA BEARS SET THAT THEY ARE TRYING TO SELL FOR $40.00 EACH!! I JUST BOUGHT 5!!!!! OF THEM FROM TOYS R US FOR ONLY $3.99 A SET! GET REAL JNL!!!!!!! I WOULD BE SURPRISED IF ANYONE! IS STUPID ENOUGH TO PAY YOUR OUTRAGEOUS ASKING PRICES. SHOP AROUND PEOPLE. THEIR ARE MUCH!!!!!!

WELL ANYWAY HAPPY HOLIDAYS EVERYONE. AND DON'T GET SUCKERED THIS YEAR!!!!! GOD BLESS!!!!!
3,Could have been excellent,"This could have been an excellent reference manual had the author bothered to give command syntax along with a more complete list of options. The other thing that keeps me from giving this or any other computer book I own a five star rating is a poor, incomplete index. Why is it that people who write books on computers don't use their computers to amass comprehensive indexes? Baffles me. Anyway, I keep this book close by, but it has turned out to be less than I hoped for and less than it is rated as being. If it had a good index, I would give it four stars. If it provided more in the way of command syntax, I would probably give it five stars. This is a book for intermediate to advanced users willing to jot notes in the margins on command options not included and cross references not indexed."
5,Great guide,Very informative and easy to follow. I have recommended to friends and they also really like the book. #1 book
3,Nice style and fits the Motorola bluetooth sets nicely. Has weak velcro,"Velcro on this product is sub-standard, although the headset fits nicely and secure in it otherwise so as long as you don't plan to be very active it is secure enough inside."
4,"Finally, less chance of loosing my bluetooth!!!","For those of us who are active and don't carry purses or wear sport / suit jackets, this is an excellent way to keep from loosing the bluetooth. This is the only one that I know of on the market. I must lean over a lot or be very active because I was loosing them. Put it in here, with the ear piece on the top and fasten the Velcro strap over the ear piece and it is securely stored. Much cheaper that replacing bluetooth units!I gave it 4 stars because the Velcro strap or something must have stretched a bit with use. It has fallen out a few times, so I am very careful fastening it now."
1,Did not receive what I ordered (BLT-04 Headset Case),"I ordered the item (BLT-04 Headset Case) and what I received wasa substitute. I was told the item was out of stock. If it was outof stock, why did they ship a substitute item without contacting mefirst? I ended up having to ship the item back at my expense for creditand they cancelled the order since they claimed it was not available.As you can imagine, I was NOT satisfied. I think I would have likedthe product if I received it."
4,Sturdy Construction,"Nice design, this purchase was made to store a motorola bluetooth headset in. It is leather and of sturdy construction, and nice looking. My son is sort of rough with his gadgets so I thought this would help prolong the life of his headset. It is of good quality and serves its purpose well."
4,bluetooth headset carrying case,"carrying case cute and the right fit for the bluetooth headset,this is not leather its ok.it does protect the ear pc.good.in all the product is good and well worth the purchase."
4,Headset Case,"I actually like this case, although the velcro strap, which holds the earpiece in place, is a little to flimsy for 5 stars. I would have preferred a button snap...More secure, not snag my clothes, less likely to lose. Otherwise, it is a very useful tool to have because I no longer have to look for a place to put my headset, nor does it float loosely at the bottom of my purse."
2,Blue Tooth,"The design is fine, but the case is too soft to keep the device from turning on and off in transit."
5,BT carring case,This is soo convienient when not in use..protects from dust and scratches and keeps it safe. I would recommend this for safe keeping.
5,Headset pouch,I purchased this pouch because I lost two other headsets I had. the pouch arrived when they said it would. Very happy with the service I received. I would buy from them again.
3,Blue Tooth Carrying case,"The case is not what is in the picture. There is no safety strap to hold the ear piece in place. Essentially, it has become an ear piece cover, instead of a functional carrying case. It wasn't very expensive, but it isn't very functional either."
2,NOT THE ONE PICTURED,"Although the case holds the headset neatly, it's not the case pictured in the description.The one I ordered had a strap that closed over the top to keep the headset inside. The one I received had no strap so the headset falls out from time to time. I referred a friend to this website before I received mine and she ordered two of the same cases.Hers had no strap either. She contacted Eforcity and they replied they do not sell the one with the strap (so why was it advertised?). The cost to return it was equal to the cost of the product so we kept them."
1,Turns on Bluetooth,This item does not work well if your Bluetooth is thick and short. (I do not remember the model number of the Bluetooth.)
5,Great item,"Great item. Shipped exactly as described. Works great! I have a Blackberry 7100i and it works great. It does work with d/c but of course you need to hold the button on the phone. I had a little problem with the fit on my ear, but I seem to have gotten the hang of it. I only use it when driving or walking around so it's good for my use."
3,Motorola Bluetooth Headset Carrying Case,The case is just what it is supposed to be. I only wish there was a way to keep from bumping the devise on when it is in the case!
3,OK Product,"I purchased two of this product. I kept one and gave one to my daughter. I was only moderately satisfied with mine. If you are not careful when you put it in the case, you can accidentally turn it on, which I have done. My daughter is very satisfied with hers and has not had the problem of accidental turn as I have."
5,Great Addition,"I have enjoyed using the carrying case for my bluetooth. Since it has a clip, I can attach it to my purse when not in use."
2,It seemed like a good idea at the time,"I bought the BLT-04 case to use with the Motorola H700 headset. It fits the headset very nicely, but.. But, the design of the case does not prevent the multifunction button from being pushed if the case is at all squeezed, even though there is a recess in the case cover you'd think would prevent that. The result is that I'd often find the pairing light on and the battery close to drained.If you are going to clip the case on a shirt pocket, it might be ok, though even the tension of the elastic of the case is enough to push the headset button. If the case will be put inside a briefcase or purse, then you should probably reconsider."
5,A must if you own a bluetooth,Great to keep your bluetooth in so you do not break it when not in use
2,Too Small,"Even though it says average adult, a very slim women could barely fit into this costume. We ended up having to cut it apart in order for a normal size man to be able to wear it."
1,I wasted 35 bucks on this tripe,I found the book to be poorly organized and replete with grammatical errors. They also should have run spell check. I put it under the short leg of my coffee table. It works great!
5,Life Saver,Same quality as H/P uses in my computer. I needed the right angle connector since the second drive is up so close to the main drive. The right angle is an absolute must!
4,"100% Fun, 100% Action, 100% Indy!","I am not an experienced gamer, in fact this is the first real computer game I have bought and so far I am loving it! It feels 100% Indiana Jones and the story thus far (I'm not done yet!) has been entertaining. Some people have complained that there are a lot of different keys to learn for different movements. However, after warming up on the first level you pretty much have all of the important ones down. I highly recommend this game to anyone who likes Indiana Jones and wants a crack at solving an Indy mystery on their own! (I would have given this 4.5 stars if possible!)"
1,Why not say it is for Windows only?,The specs say nothing about operating system. Is it fair to assume it will work on a Mac? I'd say so. But no! How frustrating!
1,Not For Me,"I failed to install this modem after repeated attempts. It was quite frustrating. There was no real help in the accompanying booklet nor online (useless). We ended up going to a local store and buying another brand, which, lo and behold, installed with the first try. The new modem came with full instructions that were so complete they even had a section of how to set up AOL (our isp) for the new modem.Thankfully, amazing Amazon.com is allowing us to return the useless (to us)Trendnet modem."
3,Works great (most of the time),"When I bought my laptop it didn't have a modem so I was forced to get a usb modem since I can only get dial-up internet where I live. I bought this modem and it was really easy to use. Plugged it right in and my computer automatically detected it and loaded the driver.There have been a few cons with it. One of them is it's very bulky. I have two usb plugins but when this modem is plugged in I can only use one. The second con is I've had to replace this modem a couple of times since I bought it in 2010. I had no problems with exchanging it though. I let the manufacture know what the problem was, sent the modem in, and they sent the replacement! The second time I had to replace it I contacted them and they even paid for the shipping to return it since I had already had to pay to return it once before. The tech support there was very fast and helpful so even though I had to use my warranty I had a pleasant interaction with them."
4,Solves Windows 7 problem,"My dial-up modem stopped working when I installed Windows 7. I need the modem for downloading to my Juno email program, even though I read on webmail. This was an easy fix since the original modem in my Dell desktop is no longer supported."
5,Almost perfect modem,"This modem is amazingly compact and excellent worker, one drawback with it is the lenght of USB plug, I have an IBM computer and I could not insert the modem into built in USB ports due to shortnes of its plug or bulk of its body, I had to get additional USB multiplier outlet to use this modem, other than that everything is 5 stars. Louise"
1,Poor Quality,This product was defective upon arrival and never really worked so I had to return it. I have never been disappointed with a product from Amazon until I purchased this. It just seemed to be cheaply made.
5,Works like a charm,"I plugged it into a free USB port, Windows (Vista x64) downloaded and installed the driver automatically, I plugged in a phone line and immediately started sending faxes -- no hassles, no glitches. Just what I needed, at a great price, and it's cute! What's not to like?"
2,Will not work correctly with windows7,Could not get this modem to function properly w/windows7. It would work part of the time and other times it just wouldn't. Even tried running it in compatibility mode and same problems. Hey if you have a older O/S and dial-up who knows it may be perfect for you but for me it just didn't work.
5,Excellent USB dial-up modem,"I purchased this TRENDnet USB dial-up modem as a back-up of my DSL line. I installed the driver for XP on two netbooks without problems. I did not install the additional software because I do not need it. I created a dial-up connection and I was connecting to the ISP's local dial-up back-up number in seconds. There are two minor things I would like to point out: (1) when the driver is working, a red light will appear on the unit (I wish that the light be green instead of red, which often suggests a problem); and (2) I wish that the unit be smaller (it is about 3 inches long). But, overall this modem is working fine so far, is easy to use, and is relatively inexpensive."
5,Installed and worked fine in windows 7 64 bit,"I did not try to install with the disc provided-went to the site and downloaded the windows 7 drivers, [...], (install from the set up file in the 64 bit folder created after download) and you should be fine and do not insert the modem until the set up is complete."
4,USN(Ret),"When I purchased this TRENDnet 56K Modem my concern was whether or not it would be supported by Windows 7.There have been no issues with this product. Also, it works well with my Windows XP Mini Laptop."
5,"Excellent, insightful, and candid","I am a white, female, first year teacher in a school that is 95% African-American. This book is so ""right on"" as it explains the plight of black children. I witness almost daily, everything Dr. Jenkins speaks of in this excellent, insightful book. I applaud his candor to voice what many only whisper behind closed doors. Solutions to the problems will only happen when we began to admit what the problems are, and begin to address them with positive strategies."
5,Darn that was easy,"I had a FireGenie system and the remote broke. A replacement was too expensive, so I just bought this instead. It literally installed in less than 5 minutes. Just make the electrical connections, stick the batteries in, and you are good to go. Brilliant..."
4,strong glue,"This glue works great, need to get some more soon!!!! Wished it came in a larger container, but overall, works very well on glass."
1,Looking for an introduction to Aikido? Look elswhere.,"Mr. Tegner obviously knows little to nothing about Aikido. This is probably one of the worst examples I've ever seen of a book dealing with the subject. A small number of the techniques do have some value but I would be hard pressed to call any of it authentic Aikido. In addition, the ""bo kata"" bears little resemblance to the stick techniques traditionally taught in Aikido schools. Mr Tegner has written books worthy of consideration (his book SELF-DEFENSE NERVE CENTERS AND PRESSURE POINTS comes to mind) but this certainly isn't one of them. My advice? If you're looking for a good introduction to Aikido, your money would be better spent elsewhere"
4,Very Enlightening,"Over the number of years I have been involved in Homosexuality and the Bible workshops and/or classes, Horner brings forth some very enlightening and eye opening facts. Such as, Pauls writings, that some can and cannot be attributed to him and how he uses the list of vices called ""game counters"" and homosexuality is NOT on this list. Although Ruth and Naomi's relationship was not a physical one, however, it is truly a lesson in UNCONDITIONAL LOVE, which many of us as HUMANS are still learning. We still make the statement ""I love you but..."" As for those of us who are in clery and server the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexaul and Transgendered community, we should encourage them to read and study this book and continue to discover where we as LGBT people are in the bible."
5,great cd,I love this CD. Very upbeat and fun. I find myself singing the songs in my head all the time and I'm not getting tired of listening to it. Tapping as drumming sounds like a gimmick but it works and sounds great.
4,"Irena Tully, Impulse Films & Prestige Entertainment","The selected works of Antonin Dvorak - one of the most significant composers of all times - are performed here by the most renowned classical artists such as Yo-Yo Ma, Itzhak Perlman, Frederica von Stade, Boston Symphony Orchestra and Seizi Ozawa - making this collection a stupendous experience. The music is transcendent, and the performances are brilliant."
4,"Hulk / Banner on a ""noir"" tip","A Gripping story in which we get to look at few ""Hulk smashes"" and that cannot be further from World War Hulk. Not that WWH is not good, but here we get Banner on the run from a secret organization that wants to sample Hulk's blood. And the agents from said organization cannot die... Oh, and we get the Abomination in it too... Can't wait for vol. 3!"
1,This one does not fit S110,This one does not fit S110 at all. This one does not fit S110 at all. This one does not fit S110 at all.
1,Very disappointed,I would have expected this service from a five dollar battery! This battery will not hold a charge.
1,This battery doesn't fit Powershot S100!,"These batteries don't fit Canon Powershot S100 as stated on Amazon page. I just received two, will have to return."
5,With a name like Cannon you can't go wrong!,"I bought this battery pack right before going to China and it didn't let me down. I put alot of demand on my camera, and thus the battery. It's a given that one has to charge the battery. I use rechargeable batteries for all my remotes, music players, etc. and yes, they don't last as long before needing to be recharged, but thus the name ""rechargeable."" I used the battery all day in China with taking pictures constantly. It does help to take battery out of the camera to give it a longer life."
4,Okay - not as good as expected,"I have purchased many folkmanis puppets before and always found them to be of incredible quality. This little guy felt cheap, and his eyes were askew. He's okay, but not as cute or as high quality as I had come to expect from folkmanis."
1,Uninspired tedium,"McCullough has appropriated other people's material, ""choralized"" it, and appears to be attempting to capitalize on a wave of political correctness to buy himself a Grammy nomination. There are a few nice tunes scattered throughout this tedious piece, but overall the interpretation is lifeless, unimaginative, and uninspired, almost clinical. Here's hoping that victims of the Shoah can find a more suitable expression of their music than McCullough has tried to give them. They deserve better than this."
3,"Festivie, but a little crowded......","When I first learned of this CD, I was determined to buy it. Then I borrowed a copy from my friend and changed my mind. This is not something that you can listen to again and again. Mind you, I do love all the singers, and I am a die-hard Pavarotti fan. It is just that with all different kinds of music mixing together in one concert, each loses some fineness and its own touch. The ensemble singing is festive, but very messy. But what can I say? It is a charity concert. Buy it if you need to keep a souvenir of Pavarotti and Adams (and others) singing together."
1,torture,i would rather ingest shards of glass than listen to this schlock again. whoever thought up the idea of having the phenomenal pavarotti sing with such morons as bryan adams should be forced to stand in the corner and then go to bed without supper. i don't care if this was for a good cause. big deal. give to the red cross or something. but don't make me listen to this horrific CD ever again. it's painful.
2,Not a very good movie.,Not a very good movie. Low production values. No real character development. Very predictable once the basic plot is set. Just not that good.
3,thread earrings 14k gold,"I like these earrings but they are very light. The earrings are different, they cost too much for the little amount gold there is, but I decided to keep them."
4,Solid progressive melodic power-metal...,"'Melancholy Beast' is the first release from this Danish / American band and a pretty solid debut album if I might add. As stated in the title of the review, this band throws in progressive touches from time to time that add depth to their songs. Musicianship is top notch, and their vocalist ( through the first 2 albums, he has since departed ) deserves mentioning here as well, as his great vocals play an intricate role in the sound of Pyramaze. Fans of melodic power metal look no further!"
5,An Incredible Work,"GURPS Infinite Worlds is truly one of the best tools created by GURPS. It comes with descriptions of dozens of worlds to use, and gives every thing you need to make new ones. Infinity, the corporation that travels through the worlds (and the books main route to exploration)is incredibly detailed, all the way down to day-to-day operations. It evens includes a handy guide for timetravel. And, of course, infinite enemies to run into are described, complete with templates to use. It deserves its award."
2,DONT KNOW IF I LOVED IT OR HATED IT,THIS BOOK WAS NOT WHAT I WAS EXPECTING...I UNDERSTOOD WHAT THE CONCEPT OF THE BOOK WAS BUT IN MY OWN WORD I THOUGHT THAT THEY TOOK TO LONG TO GET TO WHO WAS THE RAT AND I WAS JUST BORED...
1,COME ON NOW,"I COULD ONLY READ TWO CHAPTERS OF THIS BEFORE I BECAME BORED WITH IT. WHAT THE HELL.. THIS BOOK DID NOTHING FOR ME, FROM THE FIRST WORD I'VE READ TO THE LAST ONE. IT STARTS OFF SLOW AND CONTINUES THAT WAY. I REALLY DIDNT LIKE THIS BOOK, AND TRIPLE CROWN NEED TO COME ON WITH IT. STOP PUBLISHING STUFF YOU HAVENT READ YOURSELF."
4,Different - challenging - Fun!,This was a very different workout and I did not have to modify much in it. I am a former athlete with a spinal disc injury. I usually find exercise programs either not challenging enough or much too impactful on bones/joints etc.....in order for them to get my heartrate up or work muscles. I did not have any of those issues with this program. Richard is funny.....obviously a classic dancer...and I appreciated that...given my background as a competitive athlete. It is NOT for the faint of heart...so beware....if you want something easy - Do NOT get this....if you want a challenge that is easy to work with and does not cause undo stress on joints...this is for you! Enjoy!
1,Horrid,"Boring and pointless. Terrible job of editing. Why it was done, I don't know. Why I picked it up, I don't know either."
3,America is now a mission field,"This book points out what we already know and that is that the gospel faces an increasing hostile or indifferent culture. Therefore the US has now transitioned to the mission field that is ignorant of the gospel. This book encourages church leaders to break old patterns of thought and be open to new approaches. The authors stress that the church must connect with the community in various ways and must make it ""safe"" for those being drawn to Christ to enter the fellowship of believers. However I only give this books three stars because 1) much of the advice isn't that novel and 2) there seems to be a ""consultant"" flavor to the book (a little too much like business marketing). It seems to be a little too much marketing centered rather than God centered. However having stated these reservations, I do recommended the book for those looking for new ideas and approaches to reach out the their community."
4,Seeing the Church as it really is in the world,"Stetzer does a great job here of making the case for a contextualized expression of the Church, that sticks to an ancient, orthodox theology. I would recommend that every pastor read this book, as well as one of his other books ""Planting Missional Churches"""
3,Not to Buck Standards,I had an older version of the metro knife that I loved but set it down one day and lost it. The older version was more typical with hook bottle opener instead of full wrap around style. New style is heavier in my pocket. Harder to remove bottle caps. Smaller blade (but still very sharp). None of these were big problems for me but what bugged me was the 3 rivets that hold this together. They are not finished around the edges and feel sharp. They can scratch on cloths or even get caught on clothing and possibly tear. Not what I expect from Buck knives. Likely this is simply a cheap import with a shotty buck stamp on the bottle opener.
5,It has a moment.,There is a moment at the end of the days were golden where the music get low and all you here is Jeremy Enigk singing. It is such a memorable moment that it made buying the record worth the money just to hear it. Also there is just great little suttle changes Enigk and the other members do to songs to make them special.
1,pretty disappointing,"this cd was one of the most disappointing things i have ever spent money on. i am a college student and after listening to it for the first time, i put it in my desk drawer and it is yet to be removed. DO NOT BUY THIS CD. by the way, i am a true fan, dont get me wrong. i love their other cds. diary is one of the best cds i have ever heard."
2,Disappointing DVD,"I was disappointed in this DVD. Several of the items were very old, and not good examples of the best Hope/Crosby material. If you want a complete collection of Hope and Crosby, I guess this DVD might be okay for purchase. But, if you're looking for good entertainment, consider better alternatives or save your money."
5,True Love,"I just finished this book today and I can say I really enjoyed the ending. Mina and Victor were soul mates, they were destined to be with one another from day 1, they just didn't know that they would be together. I was glad that Mina was able to get out of her crazy relationship with Andrew, I couldn't stand him or his Boigie family. Iam also glad that things worked out for her at the end, she really loved Victor and stood with him through thick and thin; Victor also did the same for her. If there was true love in their aspect the divorce rate would be alot lower than what it is right now in America."
3,Just ok,"The ending sequence was a big stretch for me. Oh and I found the overuse of the N word and the word ""ma"" to be pretty annoying. It's like ok ok he's a thug I get it already."
3,Okay book...,"This book was just okay...it did hold my interest, however; it wasn't proofread very well. A lot of times the wrong words were in the sentence which made it hard for me to read. I just think the editors need to be more careful when proofreading. Other than that, it was ok...I read it in 2 days."
4,Mina's Joint,"This was a pretty good book. I liked the plot and it kept me interested. I would definitely look forward for a part two, to see what happens next with Meesa and Black and Mina and Victor. Keisha Ervin is a gifted author. There's no doubt about it."
4,Zune AC power adapter,"If this Zune replacement AC charger is not original equipment, it's as good as it gets.Looks and performs like my new one that came with my Zune.I would recomend the charger, I also purchased a connection cord, it to looks and performs great as well.The prices very reasonable, and shipping was quite fast.Good alround buying experience...Thanks Amazon"
5,Flawless,"It's a product that works absolutely great. Can't think of a single thing wrong with it. Easy to use and enjoyable overall. Although it's Zune-branded, it is a standard USB charger, so if you have any other USB-chargeable devices, you can use this too!"
5,the best,"I love this movie. Kate Jackson did a great job. I shows what happens in real life if you are not happy at home. It stirs up excitement, give something to think about, and puts one in the mood."
3,"OK, but not great","The rubber switch cover tore after a year, and the lens bezel threads wore quickly with the repeated bulb changes. The light is bright and long lasting."
4,Provides extensive insights to scriptural account,The book gives a lot of helpful background information on the cultural and political conditions underlying events described in the Book of Judges.
3,Okay,This is a fun movie to watch with kids...nothing too serious to worry about. I enjoyed this movie when I wasn't committed to watching a serious flick.
2,Boring and not very funny,"I like Kevin James, but this movie is terrible, the idea of the Zookeeper who was able to communicate with animals sounded very good, but the story line is dry and really boring, I was unable to watch the whole thing, I felt it was a waste of my time, I gave it 2 stars just because the special effects of the animals is quite good."
4,good comedy,Decent plot and story line. I think he makes the right choice in the end. a good presentation make you believe the animals are really talking. Job well done.
2,A Real Turkey,"Don't get me wrong, I am a big fan of Kevin James. I loved King of Queens, Paul Blart, even had the odd laugh at Grown Ups (I won't mention The Dilemma), but this is one dumb movie. Sure, there are a couple of chuckle scenes, but most of the movie just entails prat falls and silly noises.Most movies have one annoying character, Star Wars had Jar Jar Binks, Lion King had Timone, this has a little monkey called Donald (He needs to find a new agent by the way, as the other movie he was in this year was The Hangover Part II). I just couldn't quite put my finger on why he was so annoying until I discovered who played his voice then it all made sense - Adam Sandler!Surprisingly, Sylvester Stallone, Nick Nolte, John Favreau and even Cher have voice overs in this giant cow pat of a film, but it doesn't help, unfortunately."
1,Dumb!,"Wow, this was the most dumbest movie I ever saw don't waste your money or time on this one.Even the kids fell asleep watching it no creativity in this movie at all must of been very low budget."
3,ok movie,"good movie, not as funny as it could have been. The draw was the leading man, he is funny in almost everything that he does."
2,Not Worth It,"I thought this movie was going to be funny, and I couldn't be more wrong. Story was slow, and not even my kids were into it."
2,Zookeeper,This film was not well crafted and would appeal mostly to the younger crowd. I expected more from the star lineup
1,cinavia polluted audio,"This title has cinavia in the audio track. Cinavia plants spurious audio signals within the audio track so some cinaviaprogrammed blu-ray players and devices can detect if you are watching your purchased movie via an unauthorized player (using a copy, watching it form a server system, etc).Educate Sony to concentrate on worthy quality video products instead of wasting our purchase money on their copy prevention paranoia. Do not buy this title! Rent it or skip it."
2,Animal love,"I rented this movie and loved it until the animals began to talk, then I realized this flick was for children. Then it turned into a love story and I began to regain some hope, until the cliche ending of racing to the airport. But since airport security has lost their mind, you can't do that anymore. However, if one were to try, forget using a cell phone, perhaps riding an ostrich or a gorilla would be easier. But what do I know?"
4,We love them!,"Bought these for my 2 year old. Took the advise of previous reviewers and bought a size bigger and they are fine, even a little big. Which is ok. They are better made than other froggy boots we've bought at a popular retail store for the same price. They have tough soles which makes them a little heavy, so I wouldn't put them on the feet of a real little guy. The best part of these boots is my 2 year old can put them on all by himself."
4,Not bad,"Pretty easy to setup and not as bulky as other kits that has a cradle for your phone. Bad part is that since there is no cradle, you really don't have any secure place to put your phone in. The main unit has a speaker and a cigarette lighter attachment. Then you have the microphone (which can be attached to the sun visor or yourself) and a connector to your phone. The microphone is sensitive enough and the unit has a mute so the caller can't hear you and a private button so no one else in the car can hear the caller. Lastly, the unit has a fast charger. Overall, pretty decent product for the price..."
1,Too Large,The size ran bigger than expected. Also the quality is not very good. I found a better get at Walmart for 1/2 the price.
1,So So,"I usually love any books written by Christina Dodd. But, this must've been from her earlier stuff. I didn't like the writing nor the story. It seemed to drag. However, I happen to love her more recent stuff."
3,Beginning was good but never qyite finished the book,"The story was very entertaining at the beginning and it was easy to really like Saura because she was witty, charming, and very independent despite being blind and ostracized by her uncle for her disability. However, by the middle of the story she falls out of character. She becomes self-consious of her blindness and doesn't feel worthy of marrying William, who regains his sight. I usually enjoy reading Christina Dodd's books but this one I haven't been able to finish because I had a problem with Saura's insecurities."
3,Interesting Concept,"I had read so many great reviews of the book - the premise of a blind heroine and hero was unusual itself. I also happened to like Christina Dodd's newer books and thought that this should be a worthwhile investment of my time.I found myself disappointed half-way through. I think it was because the hero regained his sight and after that I just couldn't enjoy the book and found it hard to finish. Also because it was very obvious who the villain in the story was going to be and well, I expected a whole lot more romance between the hero and heroine.It gets a lukewarm rating of 3 1/2 stars."
1,"It becomes useless if one of the fuse blows, and one did on mine.","Me using the Cobra inverter started off great. Used a varible speed drill and a jig saw with no problems. Returned from a short break and blew a fuse, and blowing the fuse out is what is was supposed to do because of the mistake I made. I then tried finding the 50 amp spade fuse at several locations, even the place Cobra referred me to didn't have it listed online anymore. I spent half a day searching for the fuse with no luck. Their inverter with only one good fuse is useless unless you need a large paperweight."
1,No good,"The Electrovaya PowerPads ""Puff Up"" and become very ugly and dangerous looking. Here is a quote from the director of sales: ""...the battery can over-discharge and the cells can be damaged. In some cases when a stored PowerPad was later charged it puffed. The puffing was actually a good thing in that this is how the battery was designed."" Electrovaya has now reduced the length of their warranty to 6 months because they no longer like to support their PowerPads. I have seen this happen to 70% of PowerPads within 1 year of use. I would not recommend this product in any way!"
1,Huh?,"This book teaches how to draw something, but it isnt manga, what kind of japanese manga looks like this? This is not manga! Its COMICS!!!! There are differences ill explain:Manga: JapanManhua: KoreaComics: USIts best to learn from other books that are from japan that are translated like the How to Draw manga series"
3,An 'ok' Buy,"I recieved this camera as a gift and used it 6 times before the amplifier went out, so that when you were watching your videos-you got sound, but no picture. This happened with our first camera, but you could see the video but there was no sound-also the amplifier. Unfortunatly it didn't fall under warranty so we have a broken camera lying around and must buy a new one. I give it three stars because for the time that I was able to use it, it was a great camera. If you do decide to buy this one-maybe think about an extended warranty?"
5,A man's soap,"The strong smell of this soap took a little getting used to, but it does the job and eventually the scent grows on you. I'll keep ordering it from time to time."
4,Ok so Far,"A lot of people have been commenting on the smell of this soap, but quite frankly it doesn't smell that bad. It smells like sawdust or freshly cut pine for the obvious reason. By the time u wash it off its ok, after about an hour you wont smell it anymore. One time I showered and got in the car for work I turned on the A/C, but I had to make a small stop at the roadside shop, buy the time I got back in the car it was smelling like a sawmill. It seems to be having an effect on my psoriasis, i've actually cut down on the amount of medication I had to use before, i.e. a mixture of coal tar and Salicylic acid every night in my head before bed, since using the soap I haven't used that mixture in a while, so this soap i'll gave a 4 out of five. N.B. Do not use this soap as a substitute for your regular medication."
5,"Works wonders for skin conditions, the smell is not that bad","The soap smells pretty good if your idea of ""pretty good smells"" includes ""lumber yard"". But this stuff is fantastic for a variety of skin conditions, my dermatologist recommends it. You do get used to the odor after a bit, and once you've used it the lingering scent is not bad enough to freak out your co workers or cause false bomb alerts at airports. Leaves your skin feeling soft and refreshed."
1,Smells terrible,"This will leave your house smelling like concentrated campfire! So if that sounds good to you, go for it. I had to keep it in a Tupperware to avoid spreading the odor. I noticed no improvement in my skin."
5,"Smells medical, works great.","The soap is interesting, it smells medical and cleans well. What else can you say about soap."
3,Easy to use,"I ordered this item because of the looks and because it was hard for me to find a Bluetooth that was compatible with my new cell phone. When it came, I found that it was easy to use and quite comfortable. After talking with some friends and family, they said that the sound quality was great and didn't realize that I was using a Bluetooth Headset. I would recommend this to anyone who was looking for something that was easy to operate. There is one downfall, the charge goes out faster than I had expected. If you are going on a trip be sure to bring your charger along, which is what I forgot. But then come to find out, it uses the same charger as my Nokia cell phone, which is a plus."
4,super bright light,This is a very nice light without any debate. The ammount of light from this light is blinding. Not to mention long lasting. But be careful although the housing can take a hefty fall the bulbs rarely survive anything more than a three foot drop.
2,not what it was billed as,"bishop G.E. PATTERSON had a beautiful voice but he song only about 2 songs on this dvd, the choir wasn't that great so i didn't listen 2 it but 2x --- what i would like is a dvd with the LATE GREAT BISHOP PATTERSON SINGING most of the songs, He is sorely missed!"
4,I thought it was pretty good,"Unlike some of the other readers here, I thought that HEART OF DARKNESS was pretty good. Not that I understood it the first time I read it either, but you can't write it off as ""boring"" or ""pointless"" simply because you have to read it more than once. The more I study the novel and the more I read into its depth, the more I understand it. I really wish some people would do the book some more justice and not crave simple one-liners, who think that they know literature because they read Oscar Wilde and J.D. Salinger. They have a word for those people too - ""posers."""
2,Slow pace and an unsatisfying ending.,"The pace of the book is very uneven. When it focuses on the espionage part it is for the most part at least somewhat interesting, but too often when it's getting interesting, Aikman stops the action to go into overlong descriptions of life in a submarine, or General Hodges's life story. On the other hand, he never really lets us get to know Ritchfield, the main character very well. Not enough at least for me to really care about him. There's also several examples of repetition, where the author explains things he's already explained. But apart from the slow pace, the biggest problem is probably that the book leaves way too many loose ends. Like the most obvious question, who won the war in the end? It's like there was supposed to be a sequel that was never written. I would not recommend buying this book."
1,Don't waste your money,"This product does not work well at all. The magnets are not strong enough to consistently (lucky if it works at all) pick up the fish. The shoe is too heavy for the rod to pick up and the angle the line needs to be at in order to pick them up is impossible for adults, let alone babies!"
2,Don't Bother!,"I bought this last year ~ I worked in a warehouse like atmosphere and was near the door where it was always hot. I was so excited to get this thinking it would be the answer to a prayer ~ it does cool you off, but very little!!! DEFINETELY NOT WORTH THE MONEY!!"
2,Does not live up to function as claimed,"I bought this thing due to my inablity to handle heat effectively anymore like I used to. The unit was not deffective or anything like that, but it also only works under very specific conditions and that window is small. While it is stated in the manual that it's not an A/C unit or super powerful and that it works off of evaporation. I found it to be nothing more than an inconvienance than effective. The fan at the back of the unit doesn't have enough power to move the lightest of feathers let alone allow one to feel anything. While the manual claims that the fan is for cooling the back of your neck I find it is more functional to the evaporation chambers. Overall, the unit just keeps your neck wet and doesn't really cool anything. I found that the unit did work a little more noticably if it was not that hot out and you stood still. Anything over 85 degrees and it fails.Don't waste your money on this thing until someone comes out with a better system."
5,Best Ever,"My two labs love these chews. All natural, no preservatives, great for dogs with allergies."
5,Great treats.,My dog love these! She can be stubborn about coming in the house. I wave one of these around and she come running.
5,Possibly the best of Punisher MAX,"The Punisher MAX is a great comic. I couldn't bring myself to say 'better' than the Punisher Marvel Knights title, just different. The strength of the Marvel Knights title is its humor, while the strength of the MAX series is its uncompromising gore and grit. The writing is excellent throughout most of the story arcs, and the art is generally great as well. The exception to this being the first book, ""In the Beginning"" , where everyone is drawn so wrinkly that they look like humans crossed with pug dogs. But beginning here, with Kitchen Irish, the title has a run of great writing and excellent art to back it up. It's highly recommended for Punisher fans, or just those in need of a dark, violent, and still laugh-out-loud funny comic."
5,another great Punisher book,This is another outstanding Punisher comic book. The animation and story line are great.
3,My 3 year old son,"My 3 year old son does not play with this toy, but maybe 1 day out of a month he will bring it to us to play for about 15 minutes. He would rather play and learn with a Leappad. He tries to play with his brother Leappad book all the time. My 3 year old loves music and he watches the shows dora, and more. I do not understand why. He has had it one for 2 years now and we are still not getting anywhere with it. He has alot of toys and this is one he plays with the least."
2,For a select group of readers only,"""Noise"" begins with a few non-technical subjects such as regulations on noise levels in residential areas, and then gets to information theory. The non-technical chapters are interesting, as are the comments about information theory. The problem is that I found the actual chapters on information theory impossibly difficult and gave up. As an indication of my background, I have a Master's degree in statistics, so I have to conclude this book is for a select group of readers only."
1,"Interesting Topic, Poorly Written","I got this book to learn about noise for my upcoming post-doctoral studies. Unfortunately, it is the worst popular science book I have ever read (and I read alot of 'em). Kosko glosses over certain topics that require much more explanation to fully understand, while going in-depth into other, more uninteresting examples in a redundant and boring fashion. He often throws out rather complex concepts as if the reader must know what it is, which makes for such a bumpy ride. Do you know the difference between positive and negative frequency is? Kosko will assume you do. I have been tempted several times to throw the book down and give up on it. Want a good pop sci book, try Brian Greene or James Gleick."
1,good looking but weak quality,this dish got cracket at the very first time I used it in oven with temp 350F
4,Wooden blocks are always fun for the kids!,"I played with wooden blocks when I was a kid and bought these for my 3-year-old son. He loves them. They are simple, but he can let his imagination run wild building (and tearing down) all sorts of things.My only minor complaint is they are smaller than what I expected."
4,Heavy duty!,"Just as I expected, works well...but the thin plastic handles slip off after a few uses. Great tool otherwise!"
1,obsolete not supported by manufacturer,The one I received had a defective 30 quart pan. It started leaking hot oil once the pan heated up. I contacted Eastman Outdoors and was told these are no longer available and no replacement stainless steel pan is available. Eastman Outdoors does not stand behind the products they produce. The only saving grace was Amazon was willing to replace it or refund my money.
4,Raven's End,"I thought Raven's End was an excellent animal fantasy book. You could really tell that he spent time researching ravens and thier habits. The writing style was excellent, the plot was fast paced, and the characters well developed. I think Ravens would have been hard to write about beacause they aren't the the normal animal fantasy focus: wolves. You have to remember while reading this book, that it is a fantasy, so the animal characters will be more human like than in reality. Otherwise, it wouldn't be a fantasy, but a guide about ravens. Enjoy this book for what it is, a great animal fantasy. I highly reccomend it."
4,It's great,"So far so good, my 8 year old daughter loves it! The directions included do not show you how to find the opening, but once we figured it out, all is well (it's at the top and you have to loosen the leash first to get some slack for opening to be big enough)"
4,Fantastic Series - just not long enough!!!,Love the series - just needed more than 11 episodes. Cant wait to see next season.
5,I love Burn Notice,I really like this program. I have no reason to back it up... just personal preference. I think Bruce Campbell is just right for his role.
2,Soapy,A little dissapointing really. Slick superficial actiondrama thing with a sugary Miami Vice covering and a tinge of Alias. Ok late night viewing when most of the brain cells have already cut out for the day.
5,*A summer to remembeR!,"After the CW canceled one of my favorite shows(Veronica Mars) and ended another one(Gilmore Girls), I was left with nothing to watch. I had to admit that I saw BURN NOTICE because of all the publicity they did for it, I'm glad I tuned in. From the 1st. episode I was hooked. Michael Westen and comp. are a great cast, the chemistry is wonderful, this show takes you away and that's sign of a good show. I loved it because it has the action and detective work of Veronica Mars but so much more, and the charm and wittiness of Gilmore Girls. Simple BURN NOTICE is: smart, witty, and action packed. What else can be said about a great show... The only but thing I can say it's that I had to wait a whole year to see a new season, but that is more a network problem. Thanks USA finally something good to watch."
2,No help,"If you are planning to get married, this book would be wise reading to open your eyes to potential problems with your future spouse. If you're already married, it is very hard to move above the preachy, condescending attitudes of the author in order to find the bits of wisdom to help your marriage financially. It is too late to choose one's mate carefully (lest we jeopardize our potential net worth) unless we divorce and start all over again with someone else (not an option for me)."
2,Not up to previous level of production and direction,"Our 18 month old grandson is a huge fan of Laurie Berkner. We give her DVD for baby gifts, birthday gifts, etc. So we were excited to see that a new Laurie DVD was out. The grandson has his own remote control (non-operative, but he doesn't know that). After about 5 minutes of watching the new DVD he was shaking his head ""no"" and clicking his remote controller. We thought perhaps he was disappointed because one of his favorite Laurie DVDs was not playing, but as we watched it seemed that the production, the plan, the directing was not up to the same level as previous DVDs. In fact, in the opening song it appears that the filming might be done with a hand held video camera. The picture was bouncing and the first songs seem to be a little frantic for our little guy. Earlier videos have us spoiled with their smooth production and softer approach. We are still big Laurie fans, just not of this video. Maybe this is for older preschoolers/children??"
5,Fun for the whole family!,"Our children love this DVD...and I admit, so do I! The songs, as usual, are catchy and unique, even for adults. This is the 2nd LBB DVD we own and both and huge favorites at our house. We are especially excited to see Laurie perform live this weekend! I recommend her music to all my friends with young children."
2,Smells like mildew and oranges,"While our 2-week old has seemed to tolerate this shampoo/body wash just fine, it smells like mildewy towels and oranges. Not super pleasant. I'll be looking for a new shampoo that lets our sweet baby smell like a baby and not a dirty dish towel. Yuck."
2,My baby's skin is too sensitive for it,"I thought I would love this after reading the other reviews. I didn't really care for the smell, but it wasn't offensive, so I figured I could handle it since it was all natural. But my baby broke out when I bathed her with it. It wasn't a huge allergic reaction or anything, but looked like slight irritation. I switched to another brand and it went away. I was really disappointed that this didn't work out for me. I had such high hopes for it."
1,Potassium Cocoate is as harsh as betaines!!!,"We bought this for our daughters, 2 and 6 months at the time. This irritated thier skin and created a rash, left thier skin feeling tight and not conditioned. After further research we found that the potassium olivate and cocoate are just as harsh ingredients if not harsher than the coco betaines in other natural products. There really is no different other than the betaines are more conditioning and less of an irritant for infant skin. Don't buy this, it gave both our children a rash, then it went rancid after three months of it sitting, what is that?!"
2,Unpleasant scent,"I may have received the rare defect, one that started to go bad before its expiration date. I can't be sure. What I know is that I thought the smell was off, as if it started to go rancid. It might be subjective, but I found it too unpleasant and didn't want to take the chance or mask that wonderful baby smell with this one even if it didn't/hadn't started to go bad. I don't know how effective it isn't, because I didn't use it - I just smelled it."
5,Smells Great and Thick lather,It only takes one pump from the bottle for it to cover my daughters long thick curly hair I Love that about this product! Has a good smell that is not to perfumy like other brands we have tried. It is a Great value as well. I absolutely do plan to purchase again!
3,Dries the skin,"It smells like orange, I think it's great. It's very thin because you can NOT use it without the shampoo pump (some of the reviewers complained about how thin it is). Once you use the pump it comes out like foam and it's great. Please keep in mind that it is NOT tear-free (in case you didn't know the only reason that some of the shampoos are tear free is because they contain a certain chemical that numbs the surface of the eye, which is why this shampoo is not tear free because it promises no chemicals). I do have to tell you that it does sting if it gets in the eye, it stings pretty good, but the great thing about this shampoo is that it rinses super easily. We stopped using it however after over 1 year of use because we discovered that the shampoo was the culprit behind my baby's dry skin. His scalp was itchy and skin super dry, I even think it made his eczema worse :(. I love the fact that s safe to use n my baby s skin but the dryness factor is a no-no."
2,Just ok,"Although Mark has a good voice, I found this to be a very boring CD. Too much of the same sound with little up-beat differences."
4,Engaging and lots of fun,"Gentlemen and Players is one of those books you look forward to sneaking away in order to read. Joanne Harris writes in a way that grabs you from the first page and holds you throughout the book. The characters were very well developed and I felt like I knew each and every one. My only criticism is that I felt some of the twists in the novel were a little forced. I don't think quite so many twists were necessary in an already vibrant, engaging novel. The writing and plot were strong enough to stand on their own without requiring twists to be the ""punch-line"" of the novel. Despite that minor criticism, I absolutely loved reading this book and went right out to the bookstore looking for more Joanna Harris!"
3,"Great twist ending, medicore plot","This book was recommended to me in my discussion forum about books with twist or surprise endings. I thought that the end was great, I didn't see it coming at all. However, the book reminded me of Seinfeld, it just wasn't about anything. It's very narrative and descriptive where I would have preferred more action less talk. However, if you like books like that this one would be perfect."
4,Highly readable and engrossing,"This is the first book I've read by Joanne Harris but it appears to be a departure from her other works. I only know ""Chocolat"" from the movie, but looking at it and her previous novels did not prepare me for the subject of this book: A fairly dark revenge-driven plot set in an all-boys school in England. The plot has been compared to ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" and there are similarities. I enjoyed the two narrators and the surprises that make perfect sense but aren't telegraphed that far in advance. I recommend this book to readers who like a mystery and are looking for a gripping read."
4,Very interesting...,"This was a good read. I thought the author did an excellent job taking you inside the black inner circles. I thought he could have shared more of his reflections, since he grew up in this inner circle. He never said if he thought it was good or bad, but maybe that's for you to decide.I liked the fact that he scans many topics: passing, college/fraternities and sororities,a nd different cities. I became exposed to this inner circle when I joined a historically black sorority. It gave insight to what many of my friends have experienced."
2,There Not Really black anyway!!,"The People Otis Graham is writing About in this Book Are NOT BLACK!! They are Actually Mulatto.They serve as a American Mulatto Elite as found in Haiti,Jamaica,Brazil and Elsewhere. Mulattos and Blacks Have always had a shakey History. This Books is just another example.The People in this Book Have NO Real Con nection With Black People and Have the same White Superiority(LIGHT SUPERIORITY) prejudices As some White People. Save your time,read something positive..."
5,"Superb, Eye-Opening Account of the Black Elite","Graham gives a peek into the lives of the little-known American Black elite. The associations, organizations, families, churches, neighborhoods, and summer vacation spots frequented by this group all are included. Perhaps unknowingly, Graham also gives a accurate account of the history of Black-owned businesses in America. Anyone interested in Black-American culture can't miss this book. I couldn't put it down."
4,"Disregard reviews of the ""insiders.""","Ignore the reviews of those who consider themselves members of the class about whom Graham writes. Their theatrical responses to Graham's expose are truly illuminating, affirming the truth of his basic thesis. The book is an informative read. All blacks should read it."
3,Mixed Emotions,"I have mixed emotions about this book. On one hand, Graham is a sharp reporter. Nothing got by him. Every foible of his hosts are ruthlessly exposed but was Graham mocking these awful people or was a tinge of jealousy was involved? Read the Martha's Vineyard chapter and the DC chapter and you'll see what I mean. On the other hand Our Kind of People may save you a great deal of time and energy. Don't even think of going to Oak Bluffs or attempting to join the Links until you've read this it."
1,BORING!,"This is a book about who's who in the black upper crust. The author has no opinions of his own. There are too many quotes from other people. It's almost as if he's too afriad to expressive his own opinions on the subject. This was a very sad attempt at writing a book. He needs to stick to his day job, schmoozing with the rich."
2,A disapointing book on an interesting topic,"I bought this book after listening to an interview with the author on NPR. Needless to say, I was very intrigued by the existence of such an important and influential part of America which I had entirely missed. Unfortunately, I found the book poorly written and disorganized. For starters it could have been half as long without any loss of purpose. The anecdotal examples are repetitive and tiresome. In addition, the recurrence of ""sore topics"" (e.g. ""passing for white"") ends up loosing the most interested reader. In the end, I think the author missed a golden opportunity to inform the rest of the world about these people who I found remarkable in spite or themselves."
1,PRESUMPTIOUS POPPYCOCK,THE AUTHORS' AUTHORITIES ARE PEDDLING THIER OWN SELF IMPORTANCE. NOT ALL THE BLACK UPPER MIDDLE CLASS FELT THE NEED OR THE PREFERENCE TO JOIN FRATERNITIES OR SOCIAL CLUBS.iT IS SAD THAT FAMOUS OR SUCCESSFUL NAME DROPPING IS A MEASURE OF THE SUCCESS OF ANY SOCIAL ORGANISATION. THERE ARE MANY WAYS THE BLACK UPPER CLASS HELPS THE COMMUNITY WHICH DOESN'T ENTAIL FUND RAISERS AND BALLS.
3,Informative and Eye Opening,"This book was very informative and gave an up close look into the lives of the some upper classed african americans. I think this book was a true look into that culture from the eyes of someone living it. The contraditions the author makes in his book is a clear indication that the elitists know that some of their practices are not okay yet they don't care. This is the society they chose to live in and in America that is okay. No, I would not want to be a part of that society, but the author makes it clear that you have to be born into the society and that no matter how much money you make, one cannot just join. This book will give you a better understanding into that culture and either you appreciate the insight or not."
3,Mr. Graham achieves his purpose...leave him alone,"Mr. Graham's book is ranked 538 in sales and rapidly climbing. He has undoubtedly aroused some very controversial feelings while accomplishing his objective. I find it interesting that none of the disgruntled readers indicate that they have sought a refund, nor has anyone sought any reparations lately. William Lynch 1772 would give himself a ""high-five"" if he could read some of these comments. Mr. Graham did not originate the theory. He is just one more victim living the theory, but indeed he will not go uncompensated for his efforts. He is not the blame."
3,"The book was well-written, but it's black-on-black hate","Mr. Graham is an excellent writer. I like how he uses words. The book is about Blacks snubbing other Blacks. I was happy to see that there are some successful Black families who want and get only the best but it was discouraging to see that no matter how hard I work and how much money I earn unless I was born into money I'll never be excepted by the ""Black Elite"". As a light-skinned Black young woman I was upset at how lighter Black were portrayed in this book. Like we think that we are superior to other Blacks, that's slave mentality and it's getting old. The facts were interesting but I was kind of turned off. I had friend from my private school who were in Jack and Jill and I wanted to be apart of that crowd so bad that I would cry. But now that I know the underground things about it I've changed my mind. I guess the grass isn't greener on the other side"
2,Haven't I read this somewhere?,"May I suggest those of you that were fascinated by Graham's book read ""Certain People,"" a book discussing the black elite published in the 1970's by a Caucasian man. Unusually, Graham's discussion is almost identical in content as well as chapter layout to the previous author. I wouldn't go as far as to say plagarism but..."
5,"Might be Scatological, but it is funny and educational for kids","Whatever you might try to do, kids are actually interestedin this stuff which is in this book, and it certainly has provided some immediate lessons in why you don't scratch your bottom! But I digress, my older girl (nearly 4) loves this. The dog in the story is quite appealing in an odd way.When Dr Dog goes on holiday his family, the Gumboyles, cannot live without him and call him back - they all have problems, which are all common and all self-inflicted, from baby gumboyle with worms, to grandpa with his beer and beans problems. You can see Dr Dog rolling his eyes at their persistent stupidity in continuing to smoke, eat badly and generally carry on in bad and unhealthy habits.Not one of the most popular books we have read, but it has had an impact on my girls habits so I think that is pretty good!"
1,Inappropriate,I wouldn't recomend this book for a four year old unless you want them to walk around saying fart. It is also inaccurate- getting wet does not cause tonsilitis. I wanted a good book to read to my daughter about hygiene- this is not it.
3,Who Goes There Hard Cover Book,"Timely receipt of the book. I didn't realize it was a compilation of short stories with ""Who Goes There?"" as the main story and the reason I purchased. I was surprized to see this book available as it was the basis for the movie ""The Thing From Another World."" Although I enjoyed the 1951 version best, the newer version with Kurt Russell was very close to the original story including characters."
5,Not Free SF Reader,A discovery of a lifeform buried in the Antarctic ice causes serious problems for an isolated research team.
3,"OK, but a little *too* low-fat","There's a point at which reducing fat in recipes becomes a little absurd, and they've reached that point in this book. In spite of having many flavorful ingredients like chiles, garlic, and fresh herbs, the recipes I've tried so far somehow still seem bland. Also, texture can suffer when you completely eliminate all fat. The Chile Cheese Pie, for example, has a texture that's like... well, egg whites mixed with cottage cheese (the primary ingredients). So even though the flavor is good, it's not satisfying. I'll still use this cookbook, but it'll never be a staple."
4,Great watch,"Overall great watch. Very nice build quality and leather. The black finish on the case is excellent, doesn't scratch easily and seems very durable. The stylized leather band is nice, I wasn't a real fan of the raised middle section, but after having it on my wrist it's very comfortable. No real complaints. For the money, this is a great buy. The size/face of the watch is a little on the medium side, otherwise I'd give it a solid 5. This is the second Stuhrling watch I own, and I'm very pleased with the quality and value of these watches. Bravo."
2,Frustated expectations,"A poorly patched up melée of presentations of uneven quality, far, far from what I had expected to be not only a jewel box of top performances but a blu-ray showcase.This is my first Amazon purchase that turned out to be a dud. (Except for the luminous, alas so short, glimpse of the Magic Flute.)"
5,First Rate Suspense,"I had read the book of Bausch's short stories and was impressed. However, this novel was absolutely first rate. He manages to hold the tension in the book right up to the epilogue. I love authors who fully develop their characters, and Bausch is a master of that, even in a suspense novel. As a writer I always read with one eye on the craft of the novel.This was like seeing a movie that had you on the edge of your seat the whole time. I plan to read lots more by this author."
3,Wonderful Cast in Universal Chesnut,"The screenplay of this film , ""House of Frankenstein"" was written by Edward T. Lowe. He probably did it on a yacht near Santa Catalina ..no matter this is how Univerasl made money in the 40,s . Throw in almost every monster from previous films and voila...you have an interesting episodic mish mash .What saves the film is the terrific cast that includes; Peter Coe, Elena Verdugo, Lionel Atwill, J. Carrol Naish etc etc..Its almost campy now but for anyone who wants to see Karloff and John Carradine...its the right film.Based on an ""original""?? story by Curt Siodmak ( bizzare)"
4,gets the job done,"If you are a do-it-your-selfer, this tool will get the job done. There is no need to buy the more expensive version. All you are doing is punching holes in vinyl, and thats what it does. I suppose the only improvement to this tool would be somthing to hold it together for storage (so that it not always in an open position). But a rubber band works fine for that too."
5,Very Good Product,"After years of stained, deterorating, and misshapen plastic microwave dishes, I decided to switch to glass microwave dishes. I wanted to have several sizes, so I ordered this 11-cup regtangular dish to give me one more of that size. Like the other Pryex dishes I ordered, I am very pleased with it. I have a very small microwave, so I am very pleased that the dish fits in it. The food heats up nicely, and the dish cleans up very well. I have heated tomato products in it, and it is very nice to no longer have a stain left on my microwave dish. Unlike some others who purchased the Pryex dishes, I have not had any problems putting on the lids and have been able to stack the smaller rectangular dishes inside it."
5,Amazing Talent,"These ladies know how to sing! The classic songs (such as Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy) were given a modern touch, and the covers of ""I Will Survive"" and ""Heart of Glass"" are so much fun."
3,Sounds Like Old Times,"The Puppini Sisters do a good imitation of the Andrew Sisters and other classic ""girl groups"" of the forties. It's fun to hear that style used to present some contemporary hits like Blondie's ""Heart of Glass."""
2,A bit of a let down,"The version of Lady's Boy on this may be enough to justify it's existence (it's awesome and just as I remember it) however, the overall package is a let down. I don't know exactly what extent vintage TS there is, but it seems a bit more than half of this stuff is nonsense. The songs before Dee's joining the band is pretty lame. I'd recommend passing on it unless you must have everything Twisted has done. I love the old stuff (Under the Blade, Ruff Cuts) but this really does not cut it."
2,Well...,"Nice package, and I really like how small it is. BUT!!!! Some iMac users will be frustrated with it. The drivers do not appear to integrate well into OS X. For example, sometimes the device is not recognized at startup, so I have to unplug it and plug it back in. Annoying. It also displays incorrect connectivity information, and the utility is overall rather slow and quirky. Finally, I had to disable WEP because the incorrect key would always transmit. Overall, I have a good connection, but the bugs are too annoying for me, and I am returning the unit. Belkin makes an adapter compatible with OS X, and I hear AeroPad is good too. Apple's Airport, of course, is probably the best solution but is costly."
5,MAC OS X Support,"I purchased this adapter for the low price and OS X support as I believe that USB should not normally be used in lieu of an installed NIC. After reading the other reviews of folks having trouble with the OS X drivers, I went straight to the D-Link Web site and downloaded the latest drivers. I then installed the drivers, shut down, and inserted adapter. The MAC recognized the network immediately and I was up and running wirelessly. On reboot the MAC had problems receiving an IP from the wireless router. To overcome this, I assigned a static IP in the appropriate range. Once the connection was stable I added WEP. Seems to work flawlessly. I strongly recommend this adapter as an inexpensive way to wirelessly network a MAC with OS X."
4,Avoid NetGear and Apple OS X,Got a deal on this WG111 v2. No mention of anything but windows on the documentation. Called support. NetGear does not support OS X. And it appears that one option is to PAY for a driver but that doesn't seem right. I'm returning mine.
2,Not worth the $ savings over buying an Apple card,"I purchased this adaptor as a cheap alternative to an airport card for a Macintosh G4. It works in OS X, but connections can be buggy and sometimes the Airport and computer need to be powered down and rebooted to get a connection. For ease of use and features I would recommend spending the extra money to buy an Apple airport card."
2,Now hear this...,This product is not the best. I spent many hours trying to get it to work with 10.2.8 until I happened across an updated driver [v. 1.4.7] on version tracker (now I know why I should subscribe). Even the d-link website itself only had version 1.3.2 (and even then it was 1.3.1 when unpacked/installed). Even with this driver the signal has a tendency to deterioriate and it needs to be unplugged and replugged.
1,OSX - DO NOT BUY,"D-link claims this works with osx, but as you can read here, it causes osx to freeze. the latest version of osx that dlink supports for this product is 10.3.2. the drivers on cd froze osx 10.3, and the drivers from dlink 1.3.2 froze osx 10.3.5.if you have a mac, do not buy this product."
5,Valentimes Day Fun for all,"Barbara Park does a great job giving Junie B a personality for all to love. We all know of children in our lives who mispronounce words like Valentime with an 'm' instead of Valentine with an 'n'. Junie B. doesn't care what anyone else thinks it is, she likes it her way as usual. I love Junie B's excitement for the party and all of the Valentime's Day fun she will have at her school party. All was going well, until she got a card from a secret admirer. Nothing drives a kindergartener more crazy then a secret. She strives to find her secret admirer only to get a big surprise.I have read this story with both my son and my daughter and it was equally loved by both. It is laugh out loud funny as you picture the antics of this adorable little girl. We have read many of the books in her series and this is definitely one of our favorites.By Kerri J. BusteedAuthor of Will's First HuntWill's First Hunt"
4,Not so mushy,This is the best Junie B Jones book that I've read (although I haven't read them all). It has romance and intrigue but Junie still needs to work on her grammar.
5,"Start Small, Finish Big","This book is a valuable extrapolation of the adage ""By the yard is hard; by the inch it's a cinch."" It uses the concept of Kaizen or continuous improvement via small steps to help people achieve goals. Maurer's neurological explanations are consistent, though he does not back them up with references, with current neurological knowledge about how the brain adapts to circumstances and helps change behavior, i.e., by taking small Kaizen steps, a person bypasses the amygdala's fight-or-flight response, and allows the individual to gradually but surely progress towards their goals. This book confirms what other self-help authors have advised - take that first step, however small, toward your goals, and take another one the next day, however small. You will eventually gain momentum and achieve what you desire."
5,One Small Step Is Changing My Life,"How refreshing to read a book about success instead of failure! This is a great book that actually helps you change without being held back by fear. I totally recommend this book! Buy it to make your life better, buy it for all your friends and relatives!"
5,What a Great Book,"I finished this book yeaterday and immediately started implementing it in my own life which I am sure I will do for the rest of my life. What really has my mind working overtime on though, is the thought of using these techniques in education. I always have tried to take small steps, starting at the beginning with my students and have small rewards, and those are the things that worked. I hope to figure out how to package this for teachers, schools and for use in the classroom.Send me an e-mail if you have any thoughts on the matter."
5,Loved it,It was an amazing book that I could not put down for one minute. It is a fast read and you will enjoy it.
4,useful - goes beyond the basics,"I found this a useful book, as it went far beyond the basics of the program. It allowed me to discover some features which I may not have found by exploring the menus etc.I will recommend it to my colleagues."
3,Good but not great.,"It gets the job done, even if a little noisy. However between the mounts and the outlets being side by side, I have issues plugging in the two things I bought it for: phone charger and laptop cord. I had to buy an adapter. Quality and price are spot on."
5,Great book!,"Although I absolutely loved The Invitation, I must admit I loved this one just as much. I love all of her other books!"
2,"Disappointed after ""The Invitation""","I love this author's way of seeing the world and writing about it. Her poem, ""The Invitation"" is practically glued to my fridge. However, this book has not been as inspiring as her other work and I would only suggest this book for a couple of lovely lines and pieces of insight. As a whole it didn't have the same honesty as her other work."
1,Puzzle falls apart,"For puzzle lovers, when we opened the puzzle the pieces were not glued correctly they were all uneven thicknesses. Puzzle was cute, but not very sturdy"
1,Worthless...,"I don't know why I keep buying Christina Dodd novels, she keeps disappointing me. This one was just the pits. The characters were flat and I didn't care about them, the writing was awful, and the plot, non-existent. I finished it after about a month(it's bad when it takes a month for me to finish a book!) and I didn't really even finish the last couple of chapters I just skimmed through it. I understand that this is one of her older books that has been re-published, and it does reek of new author, but it should NOT have been re-printed. It wasn't worth the paper it was printed on. Don't waste your money, or your time!"
1,Horrid,It is a horrid shame that trees had to die to publish this book. It was too drawn out and the characters lack depth. I could not get into the plot at all. I would not reccommend anyone read this book.
2,Just ok!,"Well I bought this saw 3 years ago. At first it was a good saw. The fence is absolutely useless. After one year of use I had to replace the motor as the internal bearings went. After 2 years the fence doesn't work. If you plan on buying this saw , a thin kerf blade is a must. The last thing is that the dust collect might as not even be there.spend the extra few bucks and get a Bosch or ridgid. This saw is sub par for even the occasional woodworker."
2,Cutting Depth problem on Jet 708315LSB,"I bought a Jet 708315LSB 8 months ago, and in general have been pretty happy with it.There is, however, one fairly significant problem I have had.When running stacked dado blades (3/8"" and 1/2"") in hardwoods, I have had trouble maintaining the depth of cut. The dado starts out at the correct depth, but will lose about 1/16"" of depth for every 12 inches of length.I have found the only way to maintain cutting depth is to use bungy cords to secure the height adjustment wheel."
5,So comfortable!,"The Nineteen47 hats are the most comfortable hats I've ever owned. They're all I wear now. The hats are well stitched and I've yet to have one come apart The material is durable. The fabric isn't too heavy and isn't too thin. The brim has a nice pre-formed curve to it right out of the box. The hat maintains it's shape even after throwing it in the wash machine.The one downside to these hats is that the coloring tends to leach out of them after multiple wearings and washings, especially if your head sweats a lot."
2,A Good Book Aubrey P2/R2,"Arthur and the MinimoysThis book is about a boy named Arthur. Arthur and his grandmother are foghting through a hard time. Davido, the son of the previous owners of Arthur's house, is trying to steal the house back. They have to pay all of their bills to keep their house, so Arthur decides to look for his grandfather's treasure. His grandfather left them without notice, but what they knew was that he hid a treasure in their backyard and that he knew of people called Minimoys. Arthur finds clues in his grandfather's study that lead him to the Minimoys. Once he is there with the Minimoys, they look to him to defeat M. the Cursed. Arthur and the Minimoys go on many adventures throughout their journey, but will Arthur defeat M. the Cursed and find the treasure??? Find out in the sequel: Arthur and the Forbidden City."
3,Buried Treasure,"I bought this book as a gift and decided to read it first to make sure it was age appropriate. The book recommends 9 to 12 - that's wrong. I would say 6 to 8 and geared mostly to boys. If you have a child that is afraid of bugs this book will freak them out. Little monster bugs that kill other bugs is not a bedtime story. But for wild man kids who like adventure, treasure and imagination this is a true find. It is one of several, so be aware of that so you may purchase the others. Nothing worse than finishing a book to see - TO BE CONTINUED and not have the continuation. Good for tots - nice read."
3,"I loved it, BUT.........","Go Back has a lot going for it, but when I installed it on my computer it would not boot up. During the boot up phase, and before Windows installed, I was directed to ""press any key to continue"". I have a USB keyboard and mouse. Because windows did not yet install, I could not ""press any key to continue"" since my USB ports were not active, and I was stuck. I had to connect a regular serial port keyboard before I could continue the boot up so I could uninstall the software. I tried to contact ""tech support"" for a possible solution, but was unable to connect. I sent an e-mail query without a response. The theory behind ""Go Back"" is a good one, but Roxio's tech support is non-existant.RSB"
1,DO NOT BUY FROM BABY AGE,Do not buy this or any item from Baby Age. Their customer service is horrible. Amazon should remove all of their listings.
2,Arthur steals Muffy's party and spoils her parents' plans,"Arthur and Muffy schedule parties for the same day and invite the same people. Muffy's parents have put time and money into organising a party for her. Nevertheless it is presented as a splendid idea that Muffy be tricked into coming to Arthur's party, despite the lack of consideration shown for Muffy's parents' wishes."
3,"My boys like this, I find it unfinished!","We have this book, as well as a CD-ROM version, and have also seen this episode on TV. My boys like all versions, but I am bothered with every reading or playing by the fact that nothing really explains what happens to Muffy's party---supposedly the rock band and the clown have been booked for weeks, but somehow this all seems forgotten once Muffy is tricked into coming to Arthur's house to join his party. Is the plan that Arthur and Francine come up with simply to trick Muffy into not going to her own party? My husband says I read too much into a simple story, but I think kid's books should make sense. I do have to admit this troubling plot confusion has never bothered my boys a single bit!"
2,WARNING! Dock is NOT compatible with 80GB Zune!,"The dock is compatible with the first generation 30GB Zune, *not* with the new 80GB Zune."
3,New Zune 80 and AV dock,"I have the new Zune 80 and ordered this kit after reading the reviews.When I received the kit it was quick to set up (about 2 minutes). However something wasn't right. The remote/dock station didn't work. My Zune fitted the dock station. but it seemed to be facing backwards. The screen was facing away from the remote sensor and leaning towards the remote control slot and cable in sockets. Is that right?I attached the AV cables directly to the zune (headphone socket) and got music/video on the TV. I attached the Zune directly to my PC using the sync cable supplied, it worked.If I placd the Zune in the docking station, nothing. I used the power adaptor and sync cable to the dock, nothing. The AV cables from the dock to TV, nothing. Sync cable from PC to dock, nothing. Changed the battery in the remote, nothing.Either the dock was kaput or the new Zune 80 wasn't compatible. I'm guessing the later despite other comments on here.Returning the kit day after getting it."
5,pack very helpful with my Zune,"Excellent product an sellers, I found this accessory pack very helpful with my Zune. It is great for charging the Zune (from a computer or power outlet) and for connecting the Zune to TVs."
4,Zune A/V Pack,"The A/V pack is a must have when you plan to purchase a Zune AV unit. The charger, cords and connectors to TV and computer offer a wide variety of options for connectivity.I have used all of the components in my first two days and I was so glad to have these on hand to do everything the Zune is meant to be."
4,It's a great product...,"but I don't know of anyone who would have a use for all that this a/v pack does. How many times are you going to plug the a/v jacks into your t.v. or receiver and watch some shows, movies or videos? It's just as easy for me to plug my laptop into my tv and get it all going. The winners in this bundle are the extra charger, the base, and the remote. Unfortunately, the remote only has a line of sight distance of about 10 ft... but that's enough for my needs. I also wanted to add that I have had no problems with any of the items, and that everything works as it should."
2,its not as good as it sounds,"this product sounds good but it doesn't serve as good as it says.the remote control hardly works, the up button doesn't work so when you are going down you have to all the way through your music is you miss you have to start again instead going up.its not recommended"
5,Zune on your TV,This is a great product. Very easy to connect to your TV. You need an audio and video rca jack on your TV to do so. Picture quality is acceptable even on a larger tv. You must have the powersupply connect to the base unit for it to work correctly. Great addition to your Zune. Even works with the older or newer models Zunes.
3,dissappointed,very pleased to have this as had not listened to my music for a while.Unfortunatley the remote control doeasnt work and once adapter was put into the docking station its impossible to remove!
3,Zune AV Pack,"It works as it's supposed to, however, they don't tell you that you have to pop the top off for the larger Zune models (I have a 120) in the quick start area (at least that I saw). It nearly sheared off the plastic tips at the bottom of my Zune connector. Just be careful that you take off the shiny plastic portion at the top, and read the instructions before using. Otherwise, it is fine and works the way it's supposed to."
4,Romance Collection,"I love the fact that these were all packaged together and had just what I wanted in them. The package titled Ramance Collection has three of the best films made that I like The Lake House, Phantom of the Opera, and You've Got Mail. What could be better than to give this as a gift as well?"
4,Needs repeated listenings,"The first time I listened to this I thought what the hec is wrong with this production? The problem is the first song ""Dirt Floor"" is a complete mess, its a disaster that immediatley turns you off. Not sure if his guitar is out of tune or the timing is off on this song or what. However the rest of the CD is brilliant, if you are into open tunings Chris Whitley has few peers and you have to like a raw sounding guitar if you are going to like Chris at all. Its not polished overdubbed studio production, just a guy and a guitar."
2,Nope,"I didn't really like this book, the book was just to wordy, get the Davis Drug Guide for good general information. this book is a waste of money for those not going into pharmachology"
2,crappy packaging,"feels like some guy stapled it in his basement. It's just in a little baggy hand stapled to a piece of cardboard. It wouldn't matter except they're just loose in there, scratching the white paint off each other, making them look ratty and used."
3,They're pretty good I guess.,1 of the 16 screws was a lot smaller in size and also did not have any slots on top for the screwdriver. Was able to make due with some spare parts I had lying around.
4,What can you say...,"They are nuts and bolts. They fit right and they don't cost too much. Not much more one needs to say about a hand full of nuts and bolts, but they are as good as any. The tops of the bolt heads are painted white, so if you don't want white, you should buy something else."
3,Alright,"The cd is alright, but due to it having 6 songs being reused and every other song not completely finished and having rappers that were'nt even certified people that he actually allowed on the song I give it 3 stars and that's only because I'm such a big Lynch fan. You all wait till his real new album comes out, you'll get the real Lynch and not this scandolous bullsh#t."
3,Just to let ya know,Whoever doesn't respect Lynch's Loaded album isn't a true Lynch fan. Loaded was a high album and was tight as hell.
5,A Must Have,"If you have a Line 6 amp and you don't have the FBV 2, then you either need to get the footswitch or get a new amp. If I didn't have this footswitch I throw the amp away. That's how important it is. It's incredibly well built, like a tank, and I don't think it will ever need to be replaced. There is no reason not to get it. It makes Line 6 amps functional. Why they don't include it with the amp is beyond me. Get it, you won't be dissapointed."
2,Way too much base and generally poor design,"Don't buy this item. It has too much base and no way to adjust it. It also is poorly designed from a usability perspective. And it loses all it's memory if you unplug it or the power goes out, even for a second. You have to reprogram all the presets, the time, and your alarm settings."
4,Solid performer if you have an aging system but need recent OS support,"I have this card managing a 3*1 TB RAID 5 on a dualboot machine that runs Windows 7and Debian. The reason I have a weird dualboot setup on a fileserver is to utilizeWindows 7's media center capabilities on my Xbox 360. The card works like a champin both operating systems.It's a solid PCI-X card and fits in my current motherboard's PCI slot without issues.I lose some performance but the older machine didn't have any PCI-X slots and I caremore about reliability of data than transfer speed. If you end up buying one frome-bay (that's where I got mine 4 years ago), you won't regret it if you want touse an older machine."
4,"A Book to Re-read, Enjoy, and ponder time and time again","Thomas Merton will always be one of my favorite seekers of Truth ( when I read the selections here I find myself not feeling so alone in my search)...here is a great slection of Merton, not meant to be comprehensive (Merton's output is too enormous for that)...here you discover Merton the poet, the monk, but overall, the writer...here are his passions for the Spanish poets, Eastern Philosphy, Russian Literature, to mention a few...this book has selections that start and end with his ""Seven Storey Mountain"" the autobiography which placed Merton into the literary limelight to begin with; however the selections in between even incorporate selections from the posthumous ""Asian Journal""...would love to see a deluxe edition incoroporating selections from his now published private journals..."
5,Great guitarist....,"Palocios shows that he is a great guitarist on this album. He plays a wide variety of music on this album and plays each masterfully. I would recommend this CD to anyone who enjoys guitar music of all sorts. Another plus is that it's instrumental, so you really get to appreciate a great guitarist."
2,Failed,"I bought this 4-5 months ago and it is already intermittently failing on me. I haven't used it more than 6-7 times and take excellent care of all my gear. It was cheap, and when it worked did a fine job. I now need to find a better alternative..."
2,Question,"Why isn't the song, ""In the Convent,"" included in the sheet music for this musical? This song is my favorite and appears to be the only one missing."
1,I should have read the reviews!,"Yep, they're right. 100% correct...These lids don't seal at all! Buyer beware. Don't assume that just because it has the Rubbermaid name (which is usually a good choice), that it is a good product. It isn't. Markedly below what I have come to expect from Rubbermaid. And I can't return it because I got this container and then didn't use it for about 2 months. Oh well...at least I didn't pay that much."
4,thanks.,It was very fast and clean. Thanks =) i will order my text book later here. have a good day.
2,Disappointing,"A very misleading title. I was looking for something showing the very old infrastructure, hopefully most of it underground. Much of this is very mundane. A real disappointment. Nice photography of boring infrastructure. Much of this you could pass by without a second thought."
2,Didn't really care for it.,"Undoubtedly, this is one of the worst Animorphs books. (Theonly worse one was The First Journey). Basically it was a lesserrehash of #26, The Attack, and Megamorphs #2, In the Time of the Dinosaurs. Those were two of my favorite books, which is probably the only reason this got two stars instead of one. In any case, I only reccomend this to completists."
4,Inspiring,An inspiring book about the author's fight to beat the cancer that so cruely struck him at such a young age. This book should inspire young and older cancer patients by showing that cancer can be beat.
3,"Found this book very hard to get into, slow start was a good 30% into it before I was hooked. Unlike her other books.","Have read most of Diane Chamberlains books and am always hooked from the first page, with Fire and Rain it was a bit of a drudge at first had to make myself read on. I was at least 30% into it before it got my interest but still not as good as her other books."
5,Rare find for true fans,"I was so happy to find this since my boyfriend is a HUGE Steven Spielberg fan and had mentioned seeing this award ceremony once and wanting to see it again. After searching to hopefully find something similar, I was shocked to find the actual AFI recording here on Amazon. I ending up watching it along with him and really enjoyed the dedications, jokes and memories that all his fellow film counterparts brought to the ceremony."
4,bosch 1195 hammer drill,"Over all satisfaction excellent. I should have bought one a long time ago, makes drilling holes in concrete for electrical boxes a snap. The only problem is I dont like the depth gage attachement. Hard to read and hard to keep in place. I just used the depth gage I make myself. I also bought the attached bit set. Good bargain"
4,Good drill but need to be careful,"I like this drill because it is tough enough for many hammer applications yet light enough to use for normal drilling, so you don't always need to lug multiple drills around. It seems to be very well made. The one drawback is that it doesn't seem to have a clutch on it when in drill-only mode, so given its power it has kicked back on me several times, quite painfully. If buying again, I'd still buy Bosch but might spend the extra money to get something with an anti-kickback clutch on it. Haven't broken a wrist or anything like that, but I'm definitely careful now when I use it now, particularly when working on a ladder or where my hand could get jammed if it kicks."
2,Great When It Works,"This game was a lot of fun when it worked. And I mean alot. Then one day it just stopped loading. Removed and reinstalled it, same thing. Shortly there after I bought a new computer and loaded it. It worked for about a week then dead again. I bought a new copy of the game, same thing. I went to the companies web site and got no response. Does anyone know how to fix this problem? Be careful buying this unless you only want to play it for a short time."
1,very disappointed,"the product ordered arrived quickly but where do wrong match for my 2004 acuru TL.returning them was no problem.second time same thing happened,wrong size!!!before trying again I got correct set number from weathertech themselves and third time was the charm.finally the right size but had too much trouble mounting front deflectors.windows would auto stop and could not close without great stress to window and mechinism.returned all items back for refund with no problems with amazon.maybe the sensors on autotrack windows are too responsive,but I would not recommend this type for my car good luck"
3,Fun game!,"We desperately needed a new game to replace Sum Swamp for practicing Addition facts. So I purchased this book to learn how to play dealing with addition.I'm so happy we did! Now we can practice addition facts to 13 (If you include jacks, queens and kings as the extra numbers). My DD loves this game, though we rarely look at the book anymore (that's why I only gave it 3 stars)."
2,A personal story of D-Day,"This video is not the Hollywood movie nor does it have anything to do with it. What it is is a documentary about a British soldier, Pvt Ryan. He was at the D-Day landings and simply recounts his experience. Overall his experiences are not all that exciting or even very interesting or inciteful. There is some historic footage that is mildly interesting. Overall this is not a video you will find yourself wanting to watch more than once or twice."
3,"DOCUMENTARY FILM - NOT ""Saving Private Ryan"" w/ TOM HANKS","Please note that the film above is NOT saving Private Ryan but rather is a war documentary that is trying to capitalize on the current popularity of the Saving Private Ryan film. The documentary is ok, but not what one would expect. The first commentator is correct in stating that it is not the ""real"" Private Ryan that served with the U.S. forces and whose life is fictionally depectied in ""Saving Private Ryan."" The title of the documentary means that this is the life of a ""real"" soldier during WWII. If you are looking for a review of the ""Saving Private Ryan"" film that is NOT listed here, I give it 5 thumbs up and only caution viewers who are uncomfortable with vivid graphics showing the horrors of war (i.e. blood and gore - some of the realities of war)."
2,Decent documentary,"This is for the French person who wrote that Americans were stupid. If it wasn't for America, the French would be speaking German. It was the American G.I. who liberated France twice in two World Wars."
4,Party Rock!!,"I would consider this more hard rock than I would punk. You could say it is hard rock with a punk pacing. The comparisons to MC5 and the Stooges are accurate. This is one of those bands that sound better live and it is hard to capture the energy in a studio. The addition of the live stuff is great. Another great 70's revival band. If you want your party to rock then put on this disc, it just seems to sound better when your partying with a bunch of friends."
2,Did I miss something?,I haven't read any of the other Olivia books but this is one of the strangest childrens books I've ever read. Not a fan.
3,Sweet but lacking something,"I agree with the review who said it didn't flow. The story seemed to be rushed and forced, and I didn't feel the red shirt subplot belonged. It seemed like something contrived just to distract Olivia enough SO the dog could steal her toy. I think the story would have flowed much smoother without the shirt incident.The drawings are still adorable as ever, and the story, while cluttered, is still just as sweet. However, I'm disappointed all the same."
3,"so, so","I just wish I didn't have to use so much flour to keep this from sticking so much. Maybe I am doing something wrong. Perhaps parchment paper rounds? It's sturdy enough, and washes up well, but I would not purchase another one."
3,Picture misleading,"I'm sure this works fine. But was surprised when I opened the box only to see one. I guess I was in a hurry and didn't fully read the ad, so I was surprised to see only one in the box because the picture shows TWO!My mistake, but not happy. If you are going to show two, then sell two or get a new picture of only ONE.So beware, even though the picture shows two, you are only going to get one in the box.I'll write back later with an update on how well this works."
5,Better than identical product previously sold under another brand name,"I bought this as a gift for my daughter. When it arrived, I was surprised to see that it is a little better quality than the ones I own that were sold under a different brand name - Mrs. Anderson's. I would have expected them to be the same since both are products of ""Harold Imports"". But the zipper on this Harold's Pie Crust Maker is a better quality and is sewn in more neatly, making a perfect circle (as compared to the sloppy, irregular circle on my Mrs. Anderson's). Also, the plastic seems to be a slightly heavier gauge than mine. The plastic is also very clear (as compared to the cloudier plastic of mine), but it's possible that is because this is brand new and mine is several years old."
5,Awesome,"This makes rolling out pie crust, crescent rolls, etc. so much easier. I will never roll out dough without it again."
1,Don't waste your time and money!,This pie crust maker didn't work at all. The flour doesn't stay on the inside plastic so that's no help at all. It's much easier just to roll the crust out on a board the old fashioned way. In this thing the dough sticks to the plastic because the flour in no way stays where it is supposed to. A complete waste.
5,"Useful, even if you know how to do it for 'real'","This makes rolling dough, whether it's elastic or crumbly, a breeze. Takes a lot of flour on the inside. Much less mess, and a tidy circle. The 14"" seems to work well for a lower crust, and the 11"" for the top.No need to be skeptical if you are proficient in rolling pie crusts by hand. There's no downside (other than some dough on the plastic sheets, which you can brush and rinse off). The time to clean the sheets is less than cleaning your counter."
5,This makes it easy,"I bought the pie crust maker based upon a suggestion in a review of a pie crust recipe and reading the reviews at Amazon. This product is great. It makes rolling a pie crust easy, it is inexpensive, it is very easy to use, it keeps the flour mess contained, it comes with clear instructions, it cleans easily, and it folds into a small space for easy storage. I like this much better than using my roll-up Tupperware pie crust mat with the printed circles. This is a perfect kitchen gadget for anyone who makes pie crusts from scratch."
2,Not very well made and very noisy,"I measured the noise on the lowest setting at 84 db. Part of the problem is that the low setting is not very different from the high setting. I gave it two stars instead of one since it does move a lot of air, but it is too noisy to use in my home.Note that the two photographs are of two different fans with differing stands. The fan I received is the one with the dark-colored blades. The base comes in two pieces that you screw together in the middle. The two halves of the cage are held together with plastic zip ties."
3,Horizon Entertainment purchase of Patton U2 -1803-UC 18-Inch Velocity Air Circulator,"I've purchased Patton high velocity fans for decades. Until recent years, Patton was always an American made product, but now they are made overseas (probably in China) and the materials are poor in comparison to the original American made product. The fan works fine, but the variable speeds produced by the fan's motor, don't really vary very much at all. The materials the fan is made of are much lighter in comparison to the original made product."
4,Very nice fan.,"Just bought this fan a few days ago and like what everyone else has been saying, it is quite a powerful fan. Perfect for this time of the year where a lot of ventilation and airflow is needed. Especially when you get most of the western heat. A nice alternative if you don't have an air conditioner. When you sleep in a room that reaches triple digits during the summer and although it is quite noisy, it didn't affect my sleep at all."
3,3 speed?,I had owned a Patton fan before and really liked it until it fell out of a window... broke! I went to buy another one and couldn't find them anywhere except amazon. The first I received had been smashed within the factory box. The replacement fan was okay. The 3 speeds are so close together it's hard to tell them apart and it's a lot louder than my previous fan. The fan doesn't feel as heavy as my older fan even though the older fan was a smaller fan. It would make a great garage fan but I'll look elsewhere for another house fan.
5,Great fan!,"We have used these kind of fans for years. I recently purchased two more fans. One for my husband and one for my son, they are the only kind they want to use."
3,A variety of clips from yesteryear.....,Some good stories.....can fall asleep at times.....some good features though.....a must for any railroad buff and collectors...quality of the pictures quite good......
1,Rolling Repackaging,"That's right....you're reading this from a DIE HARD STONES FAN....the Stones have done it again...they've taken songs we all have (and do love) and re-re-re-re-released it...when will it end?There was a time when I was interested in the outtakes and bootlegs...Well..I've gotten some of the tunes and folks let me just say Thank God the 'stones never released those songs. There is nothing to them. No wonder they never did what all the other bands have done: release hidden unreleased gems. The Stones would fare better releasing various live albums of their concerts (especially Club shows and arena concerts). There are some unreleased gems worth releasing like alternate versions of Brown Sugar, Honky Tonk Women and the never released song ""Drift Away"". However that's about it (along with some others I may have forgotten). This is how they get richer and richer: concerts and repackaging..."
2,missing screws,Both light sockets were loose. Closer examination revealed two screws were missing that secure socket to base. Search continues for a better made motion flood light.
1,Baseball stirups,"They were not what I expected,they were yellow not gold. The quality looked and felt OK but I didn't put them on!"
5,A Superb Most Excellent CD,"I never expected this to be a collection of Ricky Nelson's ""live"" concert recordings but I am very happy it is instead of the usual studio recordings. The sound quality is excellent and Ricky really sings his best and the music rocks along nicely. A very brilliant collection of his very best greatest hits done live on stage."
3,How May I Serve You?,"Interesting book about a very interesting man. How may I serve you was Steve Ross's greeting to the family of the departed when he was a funeral director. He used that keen awareness and ability for empathy expand his funeral company into NYC parking garages, rental cars, music business, movies, cable and finally into the largest media company in the world - Time Warner. The book was a biography and well written by Connie Bruck. My 3 stars are mainly because I was more interested in the business side rather than Ross's personal life. The latter part on the Time Warner merger provided a lot of details from her original New Yorker articles and new intererviews for the book. At times she was very enamored of Ross but that was his strength. However this was balanced in the end where Ross's light seemed to have diminished."
2,"Mediocre, at best...","I don't care for this song for two reasons: (1) it doesn't have an identifiable melody or ""hook"" that connects with the listener and, accordingly, misses the mark as a great holiday pop tune; and (2) Toni's performance is overly emotional.I am a fan of Captain & Tennille, but this single is not among their best work."
1,Holy Sucktastic,"Heard this playing before a movie at a Kersotes Cinema.It made me want to plunge the straw into my ear so it would stop.The female singer was completely tone deaf, and the background music sounded like canned karoke."
5,They don't call it 'Patton' for nothing.,"This fan is incredibly powerful. It can definitely move air around a room. My one call out is that there is almost no difference between low and medium. I don't know if it's just mine that is that way or not and it isn't a big deal since I bought it to ease the air conditioner bill and I'll tell ya, when you want to cool a room this fan does it with out remorse."
1,dubious,"As I discovered to my disappointment, much of the material seems reprinted or adapted from other books -- eg by Schmidt (one of the co-authors) and Minoli. Relatively little explanation is provided (eg of how IP over ATM actually works), so that the reader not really familiar with these issues could be left confused."
4,Good for the office and home.,"Great book for managers, easy to understand. Written with a real world point of view."
2,boring boring boring,took me 4 days to muddle through this. I kept getting so bored I would find something better to do.
5,Loved it!,"I've read everything ever written by Julia Quinn and liked them all. I thoroughly enjoyed Gregory's book and the final installment of the Bridgerton's. How refreshing to read about a romance hero being ""in love with love"". ""OTWTTW"" is full of laughter and humor and JQ's famous one-liners that will leave you laughing out loud.***The idea of these books is not to compare them with the others in this series, as I feel some reviewers have done. Each can stand alone in its own right and there is something to love about them all.Definitely a keeper."
2,VERY DISAPPOINTED IN LAST BRIDGERTON BOOK,"I have loved all of the Bridgerton Series books, but this one just did not have the same appeal that the others did. The characters in this book were poorly developed and unfortunately poor Gregory never seemed to have a character in any of the previous books. I think maybe this is one of the reasons I just could not finish the book. The story is so boring that I kept skipping to the next chapter finally ended up at the end. I think Ms. Quinn ran out of steam or ideas for the Bridgertons with this book. I am very sorry I bought it. I would have rather read a book about Violet (Countess Bridgerton) the mother to all of the eight Bridgerton children. I think it would have been a wonderful ending to this series. Gregory getting married could have been snuck into one of the other books and that would have been in keeping with his character all through the Bridgerton books."
2,"I really wanted to like this one, but......","I've tried to like Quinn's writing over the years, but she makes it very difficult. She wants to be known as a writer with wit and humor (we even have to be told that her heroine is witty on the book jacket, and that Quinn herself is smart and funny), but unfortunately, the dialogue just comes across as wordy and juvenile, her characters silly, not serious. Before page 100, her main characters say idiotic phrases like, ""piss-poor,"" and ""The horror. Oh the horror."" For a historical, writing like that should have been edited out. I wish her editors could reduce some of the ridiculous conversations and help Quinn concentrate more on plot. The initial idea for the story was creative. I wanted to find out what happens to bring Gregory and Lucy together. But the dialogue was so endlessly inane and boring, that I eventually just gave up."
2,Disappointing ending to Bridgerton Family Series,"Julia Quinn's name on a book is enough reason for me to buy it. I have LOVED her Bridgerton family but I agree with the reviewer who said the series has fallen off after ""Romancing Mr. Bridgerton"".The story just couldn't keep my attention and it was a struggle to finish it. I hope for better books in the future from Julia Quinn."
2,so boring,"This book is dull, so dull I didn't even finish it. So dull I can't even must the emotion to hate or even dislike it. The writing is fine, but the characters . . . just so boring. Lucy is occasionally funny, but Gregory is dull as dirt. The only character I found interesting was Lucy's actual intended, and his relationship with his father. Too bad he's . . . gay or something? So I guess he'll never get his own book, or at least not as a mainstream romance.It's just disappointing to read something so dull from an otherwise usually funny and entertaining author."
4,GREAT STROLLER,"AFTER DOING EXTENSIVE RESEARCH AND DOING TRIAL RUNS IN BABIES R US OF STROLLERS, I DECIDED TO PURCHASE THE PLIKO P3. WE LOVE THE STROLLER AND THE EASE AT WHICH IT FOLDS UP. MY HUSBAND LOVES THE HEIGHT ADJUSTMENT ON THE HANDLES. THE STROLLER STEERS WITH EASE AND IS EASY TO MANAGE WITH A BABY ON THE HIP. I WISH THE STORAGE WAS LARGER OR THE BARS DIDN'T GO ACROSS THE STORAGE AREA. A PIECE OF THE HOOD CAME OFF THE SECOND DAY BUT AFTER CALLING THE CUSTOMER SERVICE, THEY SENT ME A REPLACEMENT HOOD 4 DAYS LATER. I LOVE,LOVE,LOVE THIS STROLLER BUT AM ONLY GIVING IT FOUR STARS BASED ON THE STORAGE AREA. ONCE YOU GET THE PECULIARS FIGURED OUT, YOU'LL LOVE THE STROLLER"
4,Darwin's Evolution,Never an Artist has had the capacity to adapt to his time as Bowie does. My god !! this guy's must be 60 or so and still soooooo fresh. I bought the album in pawn shop two days ago. I guess that someone was in deep financial trouble to give away that treasure. I'm not a techno fan...but man man man that albums is just a pure-genius's production !!
3,"Mediocre, but still better than most albums these days.","Bowie is trying to bash his wy into being cool. He apparently wants to make something like techno, jungle and industrial, and has a few great Bowie songs, and several horrible songs.This is my least favorite Bowie record, because in the end it just isn't very memorable, except for Telling Lies and I'm Afraid of Americans, allthough other songs are good, this album just isn't as good as Outside, which is a much better album."
5,This was the reference book used in the OJ Simpson trial!,"This is THE authorotative text on crime scene investigation. A must have for crime scene investigators, forensic scientists, and even lawyers. The actual cases chosen as examples are fascinating. This book is also great for mystery writers who want to learn the technical jargon in the field of criminalistics."
3,Equine enthusiast,"The Handbook is an exhaustive overview of equine conformation relative to athletic ability and stamina. It also appears to be a 'halter class' juding guide. There is an exhaustive amount of information which can make it difficult for the reader to maintain focus on what is an acceptable vs. unacceptable deviation from perfect conformation.The text is well written and the examples well illustrated, however, in order to be absolutely useful, the reader needs the ability to summarize, overview, review, and focus.It would be helpful if the author would re-state throughout that her text is written for the 'perfect' specimen and establish that a stated percentage of horses aren't perfect. Having done that, insert a summary on conformation points which are not acceptable under any circumstance; which confirmation points are relatively acceptable; and whether any combination of confirmation points will never be found all in one horse."
3,It's hard to get past the author's arrogance,"Hal Streckert thinks alot of himself, and he keeps reminding us of how great he is every chance he gets. As I am going to Kilimanjaro myself in 4 weeks, I basically enjoyed the tale of this family's trek up the mountain but I just couldn't keep from rolling my eyes and cringing at the tone of the author and his trite writing style. I'd give examples from his book to show you what I mean but I just can't be bothered to pick it back up since I finished it. If there were more books out there on this topic, I'd give him only 2 stars, but the fact is, there's unfortunately not alot to choose from. Try ""Climbing Mt. Kilimanjaro"" by Stephen Carmichael which is interesting, factual and without the Hal-ster's self aggrandizing tone."
1,"Just an ordinary travelogue, not worth a buy","I don't recommend this book, especially if you're not planning to use the Marangu Route. There's nothing gripping about it. You can find a lot more interesting, a lot more informative and updated travelogues on the internet and you can read them for free. Also, this book is badly written and edited. Do we have to be told that the kind of food served in a restaurant named ""Carnivores"" is meat? Do we have to know that the author and his wife became members of the mile-club on their flight to Africa? I wonder what their son thought upon reading it. Not worth buying."
5,Deadly Desire,"The ""Deadly"" series just gets better. I liked this one a lot, Fran is really starting to mature. In some of the earlier books I thought she was a little annoying. I really like the secondary characters. I keep changing my mind on if Fran should be with Calder or Rick. I can barely wait for the next one."
5,"Funny, Exciting, Horrifying, Sad, In A Word Good","Matthew Kneale's English Passengers is quite simply a marvelous read. It cleverly combines the narrative voices of many characters to create a true portrait of the adventuring and colonizing tendencies of the British and the people they encounter, in this case the aborigines of Tasmania. Peevay is the Tasmanian who guides us through forty years of colonization leading to the eventual extinction of his people. The other side of the story is the delightfully colourful smugglers from Manx and the English passengers they, through a series of mishaps, are transporting to Tasmania. Of the English passengers, the vicar represents the religion and the doctor represents the science of the Victorians and both characters are equal parts humourous and horrifying and, sadly, authentic. This is a gripping read that tells an important story of a period of time that never forgets it is also an rollicking adventure."
5,Snowy Owl for 8 Year Old,My 8 year old son adores snowy owls after having to perform an oral report back in the first grade. This plush toy is exceptional and he sleeps with it every night. The extent of the puppet is a wooden handle in the body of the owl attached to the owl's head that rotates 360 degrees. This toy is a great success.
5,Veranda Standup Patio Heater Cover,I love this product. It's perfect for my patio heater - completely covers the unit and protects it from the elements. It was a timely purchase too - got it before the rain came pouring in. I highly recommend it.
1,Mildew,"I purchased this cover less than a year ago and it is covered with mildew... inside and out! (The cover and patio heater where completely dry when we put it on.) I purchased this cover because our grill cover is from the same company and we love it. I am so unhappy with this! I'd like my money back or a replacement cover. I need a cover to protect our patio heater from the elements, but I will look elsewhere if I have to buy a new one."
5,Patton's the BEST,"We have purchased 5 or 6 Patton fans over the years and have always been pleased with their superior air moving ability. These fans are getting harder to find and I was pleased to locate one on Amazon.com. This fan is another winner and well worth the price. Cheaper floor fans don't come close to the quality of Patton. The fan is a little loud, as all our Pattons have been, but you get used to it and it does the job! Fair price and great shipping."
1,lasted one summer motor dead,"claim to be one of the best on the market,sitting in the house waiting to see if it can be repaired.noisy also when it did work."
1,Do not buy this fan,If you want a fan that shakes and rattles then this is the fan for you.This is about my 5th or 6th Patton. Either this fan is an imposter or Patton has gone severely down hill. It is somewhat flimsy. All metal but it flexes far too much. It seems like it is going to fly apart when it starts and then it settles down to a constant loud vibration. You will not easily sleep in the same room as this fan. Very low quality. Would never have both something like this in a store where I could try it first.
2,"Loud, Loud, LOUD","Did I mention LOUD? I actually like a certain amount of white noise from a fan, but this model is deafening. Seems best suited for light industrial/commercial use, such as in a gym, drying carpet, or keeping air circulating overnight-- in other words, yes, it puts out air, but you don't want any humans with normal hearing actually in the room while it is running. Also, there does not seem to be very much of an air output or decibel difference between the highest and the lowest settings. Quality seemed iffy, as well (grill bends/deforms easily).A note on assembly: I needed a wrench to remove the nuts on the sides-- instructions only called for a screwdriver. The removable front grill was awkward to put into place, and it took several attempts to get properly aligned.This is disappointing based on so many positive reviews and the clean, modern lines of what had potential to be a great (and good-looking) product."
4,Great Printer...hard to find ink.,"One of the reasons i purchased this printer was because the ink used different cartridges for the colors. I heard that, because of this, it will be cheaper to buy ink for it in the future.However, now that I'm almost out of ink on my first set of cartridges, I'm finding that it's pretty much impossible to get a good deal on these particular cartridges. The sites online that sell ink for very low prices just don't carry these. You have to pay...sigh...retail.Anyway, other than that, this is a GREAT printer. Works well online, prints fast, does double-sided prints, photos look great, etc. The cartridges are just a bit harder to find for a bargain."
1,Crashed,When plugging this printer into my USB port I lost all use of the USB capabilities and had to replace the motherboard. Took Cannon 10 days to tell me they couldn't help me with my computer problem because I returned their printer for a refund. Wouldn't recommend this printer to anybody nor any Cannon product.
1,Racist against white men,"In this movie you see white girls hangin' all over black guys,but there are no white men with black women.I am a white man,and I think black women are very beautiful,so I was pretty pissed off when I saw this.If this had been reversed,you know that alot of people,especially african americans,would be calling this film racist."
3,Nothing spectacular,"The bracelets are ""average"" in light output. They are nowhere close to as bright as they are portrayed in the picture. My best estimate is they are about half as bright. As far as the duration of light output you can look forward to about 3 hours. All in all they are ok for the kids but I want to make sure you aren't misled by the picture of the ""brightness"""
4,Great Buy!,This product was easy for me to install and it makes giving the dog a bath easy. The water stays in the tub now and I can reach underneath the dog with no problems.
5,Preventive Action,I use Volck oil as a preventive insect damage control. The early Spring spray program really pays off later in the year. I have far fewer insects that damage the fruit in the orchard.
5,"Works well, but must continue regimen",This solved my white fly problem for a short period of time but they just came back 2 months later. I would need to continue spraying this stuff every month to control not even eliminate the problem. These White Fly's are getting on my last nerve.
4,"Ripping, Melodic, Sorrowful Black metal...","This is a great album. Very melodic, and in many place, very sorrowful, with some haunting harmonies and dirges, which surprised me, as a past God Dethroned fan, they never really delved into this kind of deep musicianship. Normally it was just, kill, satan, die, blood... next song... and so forth. But I think, like so many other black metal bands (Dimmu, Mayhem, etc.) That are changing and evolving, God Dethroned is as well. And because of this, they are outshining so many other ""Hardcore"" black metal bands who still think low-quality production is ""in"" (Goatwhore, Satyricon, Amon Amarth, etc.) In a world of generic, mass produced black metal sludge... this is a welcome treat."
1,Yuck!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Bubblegum music, sang by the original artists, can be fun, kitchy and nostalgic.Bubblegum sang by other bands, especially done in a 90's grunge/alternative mode (when it was released) is so unnatural and contrived sounding that this comes across as a huge misfire.Smashing Pumkins doing ""Jackie Blue"" is among the worst of the songs. When there is a project to do songs in an all ska/reggae/bluegrass style then, at least, there is a little merit to it but this is just plain wrong.Don't waste your money."
1,"Poorly made, fails when it counts.","Bought one on a business trip, working a trade show with no power to the booth, only to to discover this device doesn't work.Batteries do not make proper contact so it doesn't charge your phone. Other reviewers had the same experience, shame on Energizer for selling such a crap product."
2,Works but has major flaws,"While this product does charge our BB 8703e it does so in a flaky way. You need to insert/remove the plug several times before the unit will start charging.Also, it would seem that if you leave the batteries in the unit while not charging they get drained over time.All in all a good idea that was not executed correctly."
3,Motion sensor not reliable after 2 years.,"Have installed two of these, and they worked well for 2 years, and they are well built and made out of metal instead of cheap plastic. That is why I gave them 3 stars. Now I will have to replace the sensors because they malfunction. Have tried to adjust, but they just come on and stay on, or when I want them to come on, waving arms will not cause them to come on! Very frustrating. Hope to find sensors that last longer."
5,The Velocity of Me at the Time of My Conversion,"Stars Too Small to Use is one of the rawest and most immediate records I have ever heard. From the punk-rockers-with-acoustic-guitars energy of the opener, ""Kathy Keller,"" to the visceral harmonies and cerebral lyrics of ""The Velocity of Saul at the Time of His Conversion,"" Okkervil River open their hearts, minds and basement doors with songs exploring darkness and loss in beautiful ways. Largely just acoustic guitar, bass and drums, with rough harmonies and frequent, pained shouting in the background, this is a simply produced and powerful album that should appeal not only to alt-country, folk, and indie fans in general, but anyone who likes smart songs and sincere music played with passion and abandon."
3,Great Cards Useless Dice Rules,"Lets start with the dice themselves. Big chunky d10s that you would think would be great for reading from a distance as life counters BUT they have one issue, the 6 and 9 aren't marked with lines so you can tell them apart!The dice rules add very little to Munchkin, running a 7 hour game into Epic levels and they were rolled twice when the person rolling had a Loaded Die card so they could change the result. The basic idea is that you can pay a level at the start of your turn to get a result from a table, the results are for rarely worth the level loss.The cards that come with it though are GREAT! Race and class modifiers like High, Dark and Master really make game play interesting. So the set is worth it for those and other cards. Sadly the dice rules just didn't seem thought through."
5,Good sea stuff!,Prime tuna fillets seasoned perfectly and presented attractively instead of like cat food.
1,Not Impressed,"After reading all of the positive reviews of this DVD, I decided to buy it. What a waste of money. This DVD is so incredibly basic that it is really only for the total novice. I was hoping to learn something new about these materials, but I could get the same info from reading the label on the back of each product. I thought the projects were very amateur as well. Save your money or buy Tim Holtz' DVD that is better in every way. Sorry for the negative review, but I was VERY disappointed in this DVD and upset that I wasted $29.00 on it."
3,Mostly Cute and Harmless,"My five year old enjoyed it. It's a lost dog finding its way home. I have to say I'm liking these movies more (from a parenting standpoint) than the many big-budget, big studio pictures which, although rated G, are violent, sarcastic, cynical, sassy, and flippant. Big drama, unfortunately to most writers, equals all the ""stuff"" listed above. This is ""little drama"" here."
2,For really really young kids,"I'm an adult who will watch a kids movie only once in a great while. This one was like a primer for really really young kids. Could not sit through more than 10 minutes and had to stop. I'm sure it's a very nice little story that very little ones (3 - 6) would enjoy it, but there was nothing there an adult could grab onto or appreciate."
1,if you want to see a C movie,"Homemade at best, too lengthy in music and boring scenery, and certainly not worth the purchase price. I feel sorry for the financial loss this movie must have cost."
4,Our kids like the game,"Two boys, age six and eight, have made it about halfway through the game and enjoy playing it. The graphics are good and there is a mixture of easy and hard activities. No problems with black screens except when Buzz falls into the swimming pool. Running on a PC with windows '98."
1,kind of fun,it was great at first but a long time after i got it it kept shutting down whenever i kept jumping over...and...over. so i don't like it very much any more. so that's pretty much it well bye bye
5,It's Coming,OOHHH March 20th there will be no greater release on this day! And two seasons all at once! Where to begin! I'd give it a 100 rating if I could!
5,Miami Vice,"It's ""Miami Vice"" with Don Johnson - there really isn't any more to say!Love this series and will buy all of them."
3,Not as good as remembered,Now that I have watched 1 through 3 I would say this was the worst season out of the three so far not much memorial moments or music Was dissapointed
5,entertainment plus,"the episodes in this third season carry the same enthusiasm and attention to detail that the first two seasons exibited. unlike other shows that have a certain amount of longevity, this show doesnot stray from the basic story line and developed characters, thus, never losing the ingredients that spawned its' popularity."
3,Another Suggestion,"If you did not like the way this book was written but would like another version, try reading Cries in the Desert by John Glatt. He tells the same story, but it is very well written."
1,Terrible,"I found this book to be wholly offensive, not because of the subject matter, but because of the way it was written. The writer consistently misspells place names, incorrectly translates Spanish words and phrases, makes sweeping generalizations about the people of New Mexico, uses quotation marks where they are unnecessary, over hyphenates, and rambles aimlessly through the story. The book is full of factual errors, negative stereotypes, and seems to rely heavily on local gossip. In fact, the only thing the author seemed to care about was printing transcripts from audio tapes made by Ray. I have never read a book that was as poorly written or researched."
1,Two Thumbs Down,Just bought this toy this morning for my daughter and it's really a disappointment. I didn't have very high expectations considering the price but was still let down. I can't get the doll to stay seated on the cloud part of the ride - she always falls off. It also takes an adult to get her seated on the horse as you need to get her hands through tiny handles to keep her in place. Plus it is all so small that the doll barely fits under the canopy of the carousel.I would not recommend this item.
5,I love it,"It works very well , makes her fur very silky . Even if i forget while i'm bathing her . I love it . Will definitely buy again."
1,Also disappointed,To be fair I have only tried one recipe - the Chocolate brownies with Cream cheese frosting and they were in a word horrible - I have never had such dry brownies before - I ended up pitching the batch - what a waste of good ingredients! Maybe I will try another but then again maybe i will just stick with the tried and true Rosies Bakery cookbook.
5,Lets you bring home the wonderful smells of Magnolia Bakery!,"I never miss a trip to Magnolia Bakery in NYC's Greenwich Village whenever I am in town. It smells amazing and the cupcakes and icebox pies are to die for!!! You do have to crowd into this little shop for quite a while to wait your turn but it's worth it!This book lets you make all of these wonderful, old-fashioned treats at home with simple ingredients and not a lot of effort. I don't even have a sweet tooth but some of the recipes are downright tempting! If you make nothing else, try the recipes for their famous cupcakes (I like the chocolate ones especially) - makes the book worth getting."
3,The jury's still out,"I consider myself to be a skilled baker and have tried the Chocolate Covered Log Cookies, the Lemon Vanilla Bundt Cake, and the Crumb-Topped Cheesecake. The cookies were good but not outstanding (though the recipe has great potential for doctoring up), the cake turned out quite heavy (like a pound cake) and coarsely crumbed, and the cheesecake was ok but the topping was difficult to slice through since it came out really hard.None of these recipes was very impressive, and I can't say I am very enthused to continue trying the rest. The recipes look like they would be yummy, but so far, the taste seems otherwise."
4,A fun little read,"Despite the cheesy cover art, Whitley Streiber put together a pleasant little read in his pre-Communion days. He has the usual trouble male authors frequently have when trying to write about the intimate thoughts and feelings of a woman, but otherwise it is good enough. I did, however, keep thinking of questions he had left unanswered after I finished the book. Naughty Whitley."
4,Stride Rite Little Kids' Angler Sandal,This sandal is quite comfortable and easy to put on for little ones. My six year old seems very content when he can just run and slip them on.
4,Excellent DVI KVM but USB 1.1???,"I really like this product but it has a major shortcoming. It fixed my issues with connecting my macbook to non-apple monitors. That's a HUGE plus in my book as I was about to throw out my macbook in favor of a lousy PC simply because of monitor connectivity issues. The bad news is that the built-in USB port that you can manually switch with the KVM is only USB 1.1! What were they thinking? This is fine for USB audio devices and printers,etc but if you were thinking of using it to connect external usb drives like me, you'll be quite upset at the lousy 12Mbps connection you'll get with it. Other than that, it works perfectly and the audio switching is a cool function that I use a lot. If they had made the onboard usb 2.0, this would be the best 4 port DVI KVM solution available on the market, both in price and quality. If connecting usb drives is not a requirement, then this is the best 4 port DVI KVM solution out there."
2,Not for Mac and Viewsonic,"My application was for one PC (Radeon 9800); One Mac G4 (Radeon 9000) and an Apple Powerbook connected to a Viewsonic VX900 display. I thought this would be ideal as it includes cables and I could replace my miniview VGA/USB KVM switch. I could not get the display to work consistantly with the Macs without resetting the display video. Having to press a button one or more times on the display after hitting the KVM switch will never fly so I've returned it. Maybe the problem was with the Viewsonic, but it doesn't matter, as I'm not about to replace the monitor. If I do replace the display, my next monitor will be at least 1920 x 1600 resolution, so this KVM won't scale to that resolution either (per the spec sheet).I do like the hot-key features, and the separate USB and KVM switching. I really wish this would have worked for me."
2,Doesn't work with all systems,"This switch, while good in theory, simply does not work with some systems.Iogear admits that it's incompatible with Asus motherboards with the nvidea 3 chipset. It is also not compatible with a GigaByte GA-K8U-939 with the ULi M 1689 chipset. With those set ups the computers don't recognize the mouse or the keyboard.The switch works fine with MSI motherboards with the VIA 8237 chipset.I've also noticed that while booting any machine in the system that machine must be switched to the monitor or screen sizing and frequency will not come out correctly."
4,well made / good value,"The included cables are a BIG plus. - Most other offerings don't include cables and that is a huge expense. The case is solidly made from steel and the extra USB connectors came in handy - not for printers and such - but for a shared iLok and USB MIDI keyboard. - Now I can use both from my mac or my PC. The instructions for setting it to use an Apple keyboard work well for the Mac side (can use the up and down volume, etc.). - I would definitely recommend this to someone looking for something similar."
1,Mine is a dead player,"I have the 2008, smaller version of this and it has died after very little use!"
2,Needs an Editor!!!,"In the past I have read books from both Neil Anderson and Robert Saucy and I greatly appreciated their insight and wisdom into matters. I was really looking forward to reading this current book. However, as I began the book, I was overwhelmed by the amount of errors in the writing. I don't know if this came to Kindle like this or if there was some sort of error when it went into Kindle format, however, in its current state, I would not recommend buying this book. If it is re-edited, then it maybe well worth the time spent reading. Hope this helps."
4,Comprehensive book by one of the greats,"This book deserves 5 star just on sheer cheerfulness. It is vibrant with color and fresh designs and has stood the test of time that many embroidery books from the 1970's failed to do. The techniques include canvas embroidery, Florentine (flame-stitch), needlepoint, crewel and then the author gives a wealth of projects, charts, stitch diagrams and finishing ideas. It is well-balanced, pretty and extremely practical."
3,The end result is good,"Documentation was useless. Meter didn't move with the signal, and I don't know if that means the meter is defective, or the signal not strong enough. But, the audiot signal emitted when the dish was aligned help me quickly get up and running. Well worth it. Just needs better documentation."
2,I was thinking that I was more effective,"I was thinking that I was more effective, to find a satellite with this device it can turn out to be difficult, since the sign is not very precise. It serves like reference towards where aiming at the antenna, nevertheless the precision gives the decoder with his signal meter."
2,satellite finder,Ineffective signal detector. Very hard to zero and lock a signal with any accuracy at all. Wouldn't bother with trying this item.
5,A Lucid Portrait of the American Revolution,"This book provides a vivid history of the American Revolution. I was enthralled by it. Whereas many history books only state fact after fact, Leckie describes the war with brilliant detail as if it were occurring but a few days ago. I could almost feel the thoughts of the ""Yankee Doodle"" marching half-naked through the snow of Pennsylvania. His superb beginning with the Battle of Quebec up to the ""shot heard around the world"" was a fascinating hundred pages on the causes of the war. I enjoyed reading this book so much that I bought Delivered from Evil, None Died in Vain and From Sea to Shining Sea. his writing style makes history extremely enjoyable to read. In one of his other books he stated that he did not include footnotes or endnotes because he wanted his books to read like a narrative, though I wish he included endnotes to the source of his quotes, facts, etc. for cross-referencing. Other than that, this book was superb."
4,Another Excellent Historical Account,Robert Leckie has provided an excellent account of our nations war of independence. Mr. Leckie writes in an interesting and easy to follow manner which is not easy to do when describing battles in a war. This is a must read for anyone interested in the American Revolution.
2,Too Opinionated To Be Historical,"""George Washington's War"", by Robert Leckie, is light on research, maps, and documentation. The bulk of the text consists of 2-3 page biographies of various personalities more that might be more appropriate for an 18th century edition of People magazine than a historical text. Leckie is exceedingly opinionated and judgemental, and apparently thinks he can read the minds of people who have been dead for 200 years. Leckie's editorializing is so heavy-handed that it undermines his credibility. The book increased my interest in the American Revolution, and left me hungry for a _serious_ history of that war."
2,loose wire,"This product works great, but only for a short time before shorting out. I usually get about a few months service out of it before it malfunctions and the ultrasonic feature does not work anymore. I've had two of these and both have broken down in a short period of time."
2,Programming,"This book is not as good as other introductory programming books, namely C programming for dummies and C how to program, which I used in a previous course. This book omits details that could be helpful for actual programming and the material in the book will not cover what is asked during coursework. This, unfortunately combined with a hands-off instructor, makes it difficult to learn how to master C programming."
4,Outdated Comments,"For those of you undecided about this book keep in mind that for some reason Amazon.com has decided to keep outdated comments posted on earlier editions of this item. This edition of the textbook was published on July 15 2006. There is only one comment that was posted after the date of release of this book. Why Amazon.com has kept the outdated comments I don't know. I do know that authors normally attempt to improve upon their work when publishing new editions - usually based on direct feedback from users, and also in the case of this subject to make the reader aware of techniques based on newer technology. So before making a decision to buy or not to buy this book, discount all the outdated comments posted here....they were made on older editions and don't reflect the improvements made on the newer material."
2,Hard to follow.,"The authors give examples of concepts by creating a function. However, the function is not used in a simple program. I was able to create programs that used the authors function up to about Chapter 8. There are examples at the end of the chapters, but they are very complex and it is hard to match the function example with the end of chapter example.Expecting a beginning programmer to write the program-driver is a two edged sword.The writing of a driver is good experience, but I hit a wall at Chapter 8.This book was part of course at an online unversity. So, most of the learning is on my own. So, now I am deciding if I should withdraw and take a hit on the pocketbook and transcript or buy additional, better rated books on Amazon."
4,If U LOVE Spearmint...,"......& you don't mind paying a little more for CANDY DELIVERY every now & then, its not 2 bad. The main reason why I bought such a LG amount, was because I was Shut-In & it helped my dry mouth. Good Candy."
4,"good product, a little small, could be larger","Its a good product, a little small, wish they would sell a larger version. It arrived promptly and on time. My in-laws loved it!"
3,LITTLE DISAPPOINTED,"I was somewhat disappointed and angry when I received this book because it was listed as being NEW and when it arrived it was clearly USED ! There was small food particles on the cover of the book along with smeared fingerprints on several of the pages. I would have sent it back but I couldn't be bothered to waste gas driving to the post office and then paying for return postage. DON'T LIST SOMETHING AS BEING ""NEW"" IF IT'S ""USED."" I have no problem with the text itself, it will serve it's purpose."
5,Perfect!,"Perfect for journalists, lawyers and students. Comes with different soft earpieces and jack adapters. I love it. Sound quality of the recordings is as you hear it, which is to say as good as your cellphone delivers. If you're recording by cellphone using a native app, that's going to be better, though."
5,Works great,"Olympus TP-7 Telephone Recording DeviceBought this along with the Olympus Voice Recorder. Local Big Box store didn't even know this existed!! Wanted to record some conversations with my 92-year old aunt & get family history. Knew she wouldn't be able to ""figure out"" a recorder, but with this I can call her (she lives out-of-state), ask leading questions & be able to record information that will be lost forever when she is gone. Best purchase I've made in a long time!! Much cheaper than other telephone recorder machines, but works as well or better without spending the $$. Would recommend this purchase."
5,Works great for me!,"Just tried this for the first time and it works better than I could have imagined. When I played back the recording, it was very clear. What I like most is that it is not obvious to others that I am recording (both sides of) the phone conversation."
4,Works Well,The device fits in the ear and does a good job of recording both sides of a telephone conversation. It comes with several sizes of pads to fit different sized ears.
2,Warning! This book is out of date!,"This book is good for finding routes around Europe but is totally useless for arrival and departure times and train fares. It was put together in 1997 and published in 1998. Well, two years later some prices have gone up, some have gone down and trains don't run at the scheduled times in this book. I was unhappy that I didn't notice this earlier, I assumed it was the most up to date material. Don't be like me, get a different, more up to date reference guide."
2,Mediocre,"This torque wrench appears to be of good quality, but the wrench does not seem to be very accurate. Be careful or you will end up over tightening or breaking a bolt."
4,Nice set that looks great,"These charms look great on stem glasses. Good value and quality product. Exactly what I was looking for. I was also looking for similar pewter type charms since there are only six charms in this set, which begs the question - what do you do when you have more than six guests."
2,mouthwash stains,I thought it would help me with my halitosis but this mouthwash causes staining on tongue and teeth. It is really sad!! Beware!!
2,Odd foot form?,This pantyhose is Ultra Sheer but it is not tube style and has a foot form. The problem is that unless your feet match the size of the foot form it will not fit properly. It also has stiching on the side of the large toe which takes away from the bare look. I prefer the Silken Mist brand. It is not quite as sheer but softer and better fitting.
2,Poor sequel to Robots of Death,"Following on directly from Chris Boucher's previous Doctor Who novel, 'Last Man Running', this book sees the Doctor and Leela arriving in Kaldor City, where they find the robots once more acting homicidally. Also returning are Uvanov and Toos, two of the Sandminer crew from 'Robots of Death'.For me, especially in comparison to 'Robots of Death', is slow and plodding. Some of the events seem rather pointless.Whereas 'Robots of Death' was a murder mystery, this book is something of a spy thriller - not one of my favourite genres. If they suit you better, this might be a book you'll enjoy."
5,The great female vocalist shines!,Nancy Lamott was the great female vocalist and she shines on this set of classic songs.
4,A very good retrospective!!,"I was looking for a good retrospective of the ANIMALS when I ran across this CD. Of course I was familiar with HOUSE OF THE RISING SUN, DONT LET ME BE MISUNDERSTOOD, and WE GOTTA GET OUT OF THIS PLACE. When I put this disc in my player, was I in for a real surprise. I love the early ROLLING STONES albums, the real blusey type early works, and when I heard BOOM BOOM, IM CRYING, BRING IT ON HOME TO ME, GOONA SEND YOU BACK TO WALKER, I was blown away. The music has feeling and the music moves you, something that is missing with the music scene today. Thats one reason I am listening to so much early rock lately. Of the 22 tracks on this disc, I dont think I skipped over any of the first 13 songs or so. Towards the end the disc kind of winds down energy wise, but SPIIL THE WINE helps to end the disc on a high note. I am very glad that I decided to add this disc to my collection."
1,Lasted four months!,"This nice looking piece of junk lasted all of four months, when the interior plastic frame shattered to pieces in the course of regular airline handling. Rick Steves refused to honor the ""lifetime"" warranty and blamed the airline. Buyer beware!"
4,Rick Steves Roll Aboard,"This suitcase looks exactly like it is advertised. Solidly built with a long pull handle, it should last a long time. the only downside is I think it is a bit pricy; otherwise it would be 5 stars."
2,Not Happy,The small print said that the bowl would fit my Sunbeam Mixer. Not so. Had to spend half the price of the bowl on shipping to send it back.
2,Does NOT fit either Sunbeam mixer as stated,"I have my older Sunbeam, and a new one I just ordered. The base of the bowl is too small & doesn't fit on either mixer. The bowl itself seems to be good quality, so maybe would be good for an Oster mixer...just doesn't fit my Sunbeams. Also doesn't have any facility for fastening onto the base as my Sunbeam bowls have. The raised part (the part that should fit onto the base of the stand mixer) goes from about 2 7/8"" to about 3 3/8"". The ""groove"" in the base of my old Sunbeam is about 2 5/8"" inside, 4 1/8"" outside, plus there are 3 tabs, about 1/4"", which diminish the inside measure."
1,Mixer Bowl,I am very upset about this stainless steel bowl for my Oster Mixer. It does not fit on it right. I have to hold it when I use it so it does not fall. Very upsetting.
5,An Oldie But Goodie,"Recently, I went back to doing some of my older Denise Austin videos to see whether I could increase my strength and stamina as I approach the dreaded ""60 year mark"". The newer DVD's just weren't working for me -- there always seemed to be something missing. Within two weeks of starting Totally Firm, I began to see AND feel a difference in strength and definition by using 5 lb. weights. Since I have scoliosis, I HAVE to work out to keep the lat muscles strong, as well as keeping abdominal and spinal erector muscles strong for support. This workout goes above and beyond my expectations. Denise also pulls in muscle groups that are largely ignored in the newer workouts. While this is not her most difficult lower body workout, you can alternate videos that focus on the lower body. Bravo, Denise! We may all be getting older, but you're still keeping us fit."
1,"Too Dim, Too Loud","Even in my old Land Rover, with no soundproofing whatsoever, I can hear this clock ticking while I drive. At night, the illumination is practically zero, just like the rating I give this gauge."
1,"I hate to do this Autometer, but this is the worst yet","All of my gauges are Auto Meter Z-series. So when I read the reviews on this clock being too dim, I kinda cringed because having gauges that don't match look downright stupid. So I bought the gauge and true to the other reviews, the gauge is so dimly lit, it is unbelievable that AM would actually put this clock out on the market. I swapped in a new bulb, same effect. Compared to the two other gauges that are next to it, it looks like the bulb is dimmed and going out.So to reiterate: clock illumination is very DIM."
2,Disappointed,"I was initially happy with the discs. For the first 10-15, I had no problem making backups of my DVD collection. Once I got down to the last 25, 2 out of 3 would end up having a problem with the burn and end up as coasters. I have 10 left and doubt I will even take the time to attempt to use them."
3,A Keepsake for the Lover of CATS,"If you love the Theater, you will enjoy most of this book of the Musical Cats. The book delivers on the ""dialogue"" of the musical, which, of course, is right out of ""Old Possum's Book of Pratical Cats."" You also get some of the insights from those who made the musical happen. There are some good costume sketches, but the photographs leave a lot to be desired. Taken under performance conditions, most of the photos are too blurred or too dim for the quality of the rest of the book. The book is still a treasure for those who have seen the musical, and an overview for the unfortunate who has not."
4,Cool.,I got this book for Christmas and I think it's very good. It has a ton of pics and most of the song lyrics. It's the Broadway cast which is a little dissapointing :( If only they had done a London Cats book...hopefully a few pics of Veerle.
2,poor frame design,"I first have to say I love these safety glasses. The glasses came with a great case and cloth to keep your glasses in. I purchased these safety glasses for a couple of different reasons, One is I need them for some of the field work I do and another is I love the style. They really cut the glare of the bright CA sun. I have owned these safety glasses for 2 1/2 months and the frame around the lens cracked and broke. Then I noticed the nosepiece has fallen off. I have contacted the company from where they came from to see about a replacement and am still waiting to hear from them."
3,"Oh, but that name ...","Stephen Hunter is a fine author, quite capable of writing gritty crime noir like 'Dirty White Boys' and then technothrillers such as this. It certainly goes off like every good blockbuster should - I am reminded of a book whose back cover blurbs featured the phrases 'gorilla of a book' and 'firecracker of a suspense novel'. Cliches, but phrases that well suit this fast paced read. Only thing is - Col Dick Puller?? I can only hope Hunter was having some mickey taking fun with that one. And the blurb I read elsewhere: ""Will Delta Force veteran Dick Puller be able to penetrate state-of-the-artsecurity system?"" Awww, that really does sound like somebody with something on their minds, right?"
4,"Stephen Hunter's best besides ""Point of Inpact""","In general, this book is pretty good, but it's just missing the little somethings that made Point of Impact so great. In this book, Stephen Hunter reminded me of Michael Crichton's books like Jurassic Park & The Sphere. The protagonists solve one problem and another arises. They say, ""Uh-oh, what if they think of..."" and we cut to the antagonists doing just that. Entertaining, and the specifics aren't predictable, but you kind of settle into a groove while reading this book. I was interested enough to keep reading, but it wasn't a glued-to-the-pages-all-night page turner like Point of Impact was. Very well written, but we've seen all the elements a hundred times. Kind of like watching Carlito's Way-- yes, it's pretty well done, but haven't we seen all this before"
2,You don't get much sound for 50 dollars these days,"I bought these speakers for my 11 year old son to user with his ipod. His fifth generation video ipod fits the dock. Several different sized adapters come with the speakers/dock, too. There are two cylinder shaped speakers about 3 1/2 inches high with a 3 3/4"" diameter ...also a dock for the ipod. These speakers are OK. They sound good at a lower volume only. If volume goes much higher they start to distort. They are good size for a desk. My son put them on a shelf at the head of his bed. I don't think he minds them right now at his age, but in the near future I think he will want a better quality sounding speaker to play his music."
4,If you like Latin ladies...,"The video is worth five stars, for the beautiful Latin ladies of Rio, alone. The reason I deducted one star is due to the fact that the ""Rio"" part of the video is less than an hour long. The remainder is a sort of an ""adult"" music video, that you may or may not enjoy. When the ""Party in Rio"" is over, send the kids out of the room."
3,Not to bad.,Good quantity for cost. Worked great for what I needed it for (hold 4 wedding CD's of proofs). I could even put a nice picture in the front. Only problem was a couple broke. Could have been in transit but still a little dissapointing.
2,Book very poor (photo) :(,for the conversion of the engine I was waiting for information step-by-step with pictures. And.... lack converting engine on the chassis of NB 1.8 1.6 NA.
5,Superb!,"If you like the complexities of melody and rythm, this recording of Bach using only viols will take you away. Beautifully recorded too. You can hear everything."
4,Clever book with a slightly predictable ending,"I am not a big fan of crime books, particularly because of how they all begin, continue, and end pretty much the same way. And as the comment on the front cover of the book says ""CSI fans take note!"". It IS predictable... somewhat, but most of it is actually very cleverly written. There were many points in the book that took me by surprise, while others I saw coming a mile away. It is a page turner. I finished it in about 3 days, and at times I didn't want to put it down for anything. This is a good book for those who enjoy reading crime novels, and I recommend giving this one a try."
2,uninteresting,"One word for this album: Boring. I picked this up because I heard a great review for the record, and i'm always tring out new metal albums. The review I read compared the band to Amorphis, Samael, and Unleashed(i have no idea where he pulled that out of) These guys were in great company. Little did I know i was going to be disapointed. A few songs I enjoyed, but that can't save a whole album. Definetly a great sleep tranqualizer. Of course, maybe i should have picked up a different My Dying Bride album."
3,Back to the World,"It has some good songs like ""Back to the World"" and ""Future Shock"" but it seems like a bit of a disappointment as a follow-up to ""Superfly"". I imagine it's almost impossible to repeat the success of ""Curtis"", ""Roots"", and ""Superfly"". It's sad that Curtis could never repeat the success of these earlier albums.His vocal delivery in ""Back to the World"" is at a higer pitch making it hard at time to make out the words to the song. I plan to buy his next album, ""Sweet Exorcist"" from 1974.Curtis is still one of the greatest songer/songwriters ever. I can listen to songs like ""(Dont Worry) if there's hell below, we're all going to go"" and ""The other side of town"" over and over and still marvel at the creativity and feeling in these songs.They truly transcend time."
5,"A great album from the late,great Curtis Mayfield",This one's my favorite Curtis Mayfield release after Superfly.It was originally released in 1973 and was required listening during my days in the US Army. Oh what great memories! Highly recommended!!
1,should be lower ratings for this movie,"This is a horrible movie about a horrible movie. It is about some make-believe casting business which never gets of the ground and most unbelievable is the Jamaicans who finance the business with $120,000.00, is the movie making a mockery of Jamaicans or are they just plain and simple prejudice? The script, acting, casting is horrible. WARNING DO NOT FALL FOR THE SYNOPSIS LIKE I DID!!!!!!!!!!"
3,More of the same,"For those of you who enjoy Puzzle Lady mysteries this latest one is jsut another offering of the same. The characters and their personalities are well fleshed out and it's just a matter of sifting through the clues and events to solve the mystery. Generally these books are not meant to be solve, as clues are not in abundance, but just enjoyed as light reading"
5,Do right Woman,I've had the pleasure of seeing her live twice & I just need her albums so I can hear it over & over again!!!!!
2,"Great premise, bad execution.","A tape proving the conspiracy theory in the Kennedy assassination was an intriging premise, however, the execution of the idea was so contrived that it deserves 2 stars - at best. Within 10 minutes of being informed of his father's death and taking delivery of the tape, the hero is running around New York being shot at, bouncing off taxi cabs and having his apartment blown up. Everyone is a good guy, then a bad guy, then a good guy. Don't bother, this is just too unbelievable to be enjoyable."
3,Infantile,Plot is tired but OK. Another book with an inept principal; apparently the new style for leading and supporting characters. Almost every American reader must know what DIA is and who cares - other than that is a US intelligence agency. I was suckered in to buying it because I mistook the author for THE 'PREY' author.
4,almost as good as The Takeover,"I have enjoyed all of Mr. Frey's books and was not disappointed by The Legacy. I thought it was a nice change that while the book was about a Wall Street trader, the whole story did not revolve around the world of Wall Street. It went in a different direction, which was unexpected and showed Mr. Frey is talented in writing about subjects other than the financial world. I think the Kennedy Assasination is still fascinating to most people, including those like me who weren't even born yet when it happened. I thoroughly enjoyed all of Mr. Frey's novels and look forward to his next."
2,caveat emptor (reader beware),"Cole Egan finds that his dad left more than a videotape of the Kennedy assassination for him when he died. He also left behind a team of killers intent on getting the tape at any cost.Will Cole outsmart these killers or will he fall victim to the legacy?Stephen Frey exploded from the blocks in this fast-paced novel, but ended up sputtering. Cole Egan develops streetsense fromwho-knows-where, everything going according to plan for him. The ending is incomprehensible, with the reader left wondering who killed Kennedy.Forget The Legacy; read the newspaper."
2,The Velvet Vampire,Personally I found this movie more than a little wanting. I love vampire movies and have a fairly large collection of them and I bought this one to add to them but am sad for doing so now. I found the acting to be equal to a late night TV movie and the story line that falls just short of poor. I don't need a lot of blood or gore in a movie to make it good but a little bit of terror comes in handy when talking about vampires. I would have to say that if your looking for a movie to kill time with this movie might be ok but if you are looking for a good vampire movie save your money.The Velvet Vampire
1,forget it!!!,"not worth the time or the money - storyline wasn't much, acting even less so, but atmosphere was non-existent. yes it is a vampire flick, but the best of them have an atmospheric sense of foreboding or menace, something to keep you on edge. these actors were just reading their lines. don't bother with this, look for something with christopher lee!"
4,Great for travel,We love this stroller. It doesn't weight much and is easy to travel with. Great for airports!
4,not enough shade,"I relly love this stroller and felt it was the best one for my son, but the only complaint i have is that the hood of the stroller doesn't provide enough shade. With the hood you can't extend it out much or move it around so i find myself using his old stroller when it is very sunny out. Other then this one complaint I love how lightweight and compact it is."
3,Slightly disappointed...,"This was a Christmas present for my Dad. He had just purchased a vehicle of the same model and I wanted him to be able to customize it to match his.The model I received was the correct model number and color, however the car in the photo has a sunroof, and the model I received does not. Also, the packaging of the model I received was different than shown. My model's packaging had the car body in a plastic window at the top of the box to show the body color. Due to storage, handling, shipment, or a combination of the three, the top of the car rubbed against the plastic and wore some of the paint off. My Dad has said he can take a bit of carnuba wax and buff it out, but it was disappointing for him to have to do that."
3,Lovers dine together,"A cute story and highly amusing. A family of vamps and how they interact plus a mystery as to how to handle their relationship makes for a humorous few hours, I read it in one sitting, waiting for the next."
2,Can't say I was thrilled.,"Shallow plotline in my opinion with little excitement, I got bored and quickly stopped reading after a few chapters."
4,A MOST READ......,"IF YOU READ THE OTHER BOOKS IN THE SERIES YOU SHOULD READ THIS ONE TOO, A MUST, FUN TO READ, I LIKED THEM, WE KNOW THERE ARE NO VAMPIRES BUT HEY WE CAN ALL DREAM....SMILING....SEXY ROMANCE, DIFFERENT AND UNIQUE"
1,Not believable...,I only made it to page 25 before I gave up. I just couldn't understand a 200 year old vampire acting like a 20 year old.
4,Gifts for the Cookie Jar...Lots of Info,Like it a lot! This book contains many recipes for great mixtures. I think many would be successful gifts for friends and family.
3,"Different concerts, different quality","As a fan of Paradise Lost, I didn't hesitate when I bought the live album of one of my favorite bands. Being honest, I cannot give five stars to this Cd, because the material belong to different concerts without the quality I expected. The first part, from a 1992 concert, are (live versions of) four songs from the album ""Shades of God"" and have poor sound quality (limitations of recording on the stage); also the voice of Nick Holmes (at that time) hadn't the power of latter albums. The second part (another four songs, now from 1995) improved the sound and Nick had a better performance. Being the ""Gothic"" album my Paradise Lost's favorite, the third part (10 songs from 1993)is the best of the CD: nice recording, powerful vocals, excellente selection of songs. ""Live at the BBC"" represents the first record of the Paradise Lost live performances, so I expect one or two more live albums with recent material and much better sound."
2,Alas,"After 'Challenger' I hoped for another step forward, towards the unexpected, so to say. It turned out to be backwards. It's a shame."
5,The best!,We are a bilingual Italian-English family and give this to all of our friends who are serious about teaching Italian. The CD and book are excellently written/put together. Progresses through the phonics. My husband's a native speaker and is a big fan too.
2,one harem too many,"Usually, I love Mrs. Small's books. Her description of theclothes, foods and dwelings of the medival/renissance period arewonderful and so are many of her supporting cast. BUT- after reading Skye O'Malley and AtST, I felt Valentina was a bit of a stupid character who was to stubborn to see the forest for the trees. Her father loves her, her cousin loves her but she has to go to the East and guess what? She ends up in a harem! (surprise, surprise!) These scences are one to many, rape is not appealing in a romance novel even if the heroine is 'betrayed by her body'. I really could bearly finish this one. :-("
4,Jim is on a winner,Fantastic album - just buy it - nearly all tracks are winners - if you only purchase one album this year or next year for that matter make it this - I LOVE IT
4,a true rock classic,"This is one of the strongest U.S. mainstream rock releases in years. The songs cover a variety of styles, and there are simply no ""weak"" spots. If only some daring ""classic rock"" d.j. would get a hold of a copy of this CD and play it, we would be hearing these songs on the radio for years. All of the guest artists contribute effectively; if you are a fan of any or all of them, this album is sure to please. Do yourself a favor and buy this now before it becomes a rare out-of-print auction item."
4,Programmer's Book,"This is a programmer's book. It's heavy on C code, and if you can't at least read C, a lot of this isn't going to mean much to you. However, it does have a lot of general information that is of interest to anyone, and it could be helpful in unmdertstanding how someone else's milter works and how to modify it, etc.I enjoyed it, but I like code heavy books - you may not.There's a surprising amount of detail here; even getting into how to decode mime, and advice on user friendliness. I was a bit amused that they gave advice on how to attract spam to test milters; I don't think too many of us have any shortage of spam nowadays."
5,Great CD!,"Totally awesome CD! Sounds alot like old school Pumpkins. The best track is definatly ""Honestly"". Go out and buy this Cd immediatly. It's a must have for the die hard Pumkins fan!"
4,good times u.s.a.,Billy has done it again with an array of other talented musicians and made Zwan!! I absolutely adore this cd and always pop it in when I need some 'feel good' music to take over. If you buy this cd you won't be sorry!
2,Zwan song,"Look for ""Jesus, I/Mary Star of the Sea"".....it's just an amazing track - some of the best guitar play I've heard in quite a while on any album. Billy Corgan can still write songs, but this isn't one of his best albums."
1,zwan review,well i give it a review cause i like billy corgan but i cant stand the music of this awful band..and that flirting between billy and that nasty thing playing the bass is awful...well i dont recommend and i think its a shame any one would want to buy this album...such a shame
3,Pleasantly even,"What made the Smashing Pumpkins such an incredibly powerful band was their ability to shift from a Sabbath-like wall of sound to a quiet psychedelic groove on a moment's notice. This dynamic ability was and still is a rarity in most rock music.Zwan's ""Mary Star of the Sea"" has some great texture, pretty good songwriting, and so-so vocals, but the sonic dynamics that made Billy a rock genius are totally missing. It seems as though Billy has fallen in love with just strumming cool chords on his guitar. He was better when the guitars were either hammering away power chords or quietly picking a beautiful melody (and always both in the same song). Zwan totally misses these highs and lows, or as Billy might say: ""Life's a bummer when you're a strummer""."
4,Good But...,"This is a near miss classic. I have to take one star away because of the muddy sound quality - which is a shame because there is so much good stuff in the grooves you can't get to. So what if Billy says it was an artistic decision to make it sound this ""bad"" - it was a WRONG decision. I hope in 10 years we will get the new ""Director's Re-Mix"" edition. God I almost wore out the buttons on my stereo trying to fix the sound. Is Billy starting to get self conscious of his voice? Too Bad, I really love this CD!"
3,"In this case, Corgan's dismissed negativity hinders his own creativity","People should be happy that Corgan became more positive with his life, but that does not mean the music suffers in turn. Rarely stepping over the peppy positivity behind simple three chord ditties (heavy on the reverb but light on texture), Billy's whine has never been misused as much as these mediocre compositions suggest. There is still enough songwriting ability to ensure a worthwhile spin for more pop-leaning ex-Pumpkins fans, but the majority, great majority here just glares through with a vacant, yet overbearing ""light"""
1,Mastering butchery,"The music on this record may have been good, but it is impossible to listen to it: the sound quality is terrible. It is FAR TOO LOUD, probably another example of (record label induced) mastering butchery. There is no dynamics at all, and if you look at the waveforms you can see many clipped ones, which means: distortion. So there is nothing wrong with your audio set, it's the CD !"
1,No,This CD sounds like they took Corgan's doughnuts put them in a blender and chopped them up... then made hime drink it and he came out with this CD.
3,Seller Was Great,"The book was in perfect condition, offered at a good price, and arrived in a very timely manner, but the contents were not what I was expecting. I am a total beginner and I needed to learn about creating a DVD with only still pictures. This book mainly concerns videos. There is one tiny chapter on stills, and it isn't very helpful. Some of the information translates, but you can figure it out with the Help Menu rather than buying this book."
4,Not big enough,"I wish these bags were a little wider. I could barely fit three layers of cushions in, and I had to squish them together in order to zip the bag closed. Once closed, the bags were easy to carry. I ended up buying a couple of more bags so I could store all of my cushions."
5,"convenience, style and effectiveness","Choosing a Sony Cybershot DSCS40 4.1 MP Digital Camera is what you need for all the memories on your adventures, parties and many other functions. The comfort and performance will make you keep this camera in your possession where ever you go.Its an investment you will never regret!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Camera DIES after a year!!!!,I get a white screen now and cannot take pictures. I have to bang on it a few times and it'll come and go. I've only had this camera a little over a year and it's already dying on me. Ridiculous. I see many others have the same problem.Don't buy this camera if you don't already plan on buying a new one in a year. Ugh.
4,Simple and Good for all purposes,"This camera is easy to use and its picture quality is great. I have been using it since 1month. The one disadvantage of it is: When taking pictures outdoors the camera sometimes freezes and need to warmed to take next picture which can happen very frequent. Except this its a great cam for everyone.Hope this helps,Kiran Gollamudi"
1,"Good Camera, Will Fail","This is a great camera when it functions, but like other customers have stated this camera has a major flaw. The ""LCD White Death"" and the ""Main Power Flex"" will likely occur if you have this camera. My camera worked for about a year and is still in mint condition and then all of a sudden it will not turn on. Sony will not provide any help. If this camera was reliable it would be a great camera, but unfortanutley there is too big of a risk it will fail you. Definitly consider other digital cameras."
2,Not a good design book,"I found the book covered information on the types of microphones, the performace specifications and use of microphones in general. Half of the book was on instillation and studio placement.I was looking for a design book to help me solve signal to noise problems,distortion and gain. I was hoping to find examples of low noise amplifier designs, filters and bias information for the different types of microphones. I expected the book to be written at an electrical engineering level. It was not. Instead, when it covered this information it would refer to how ""the engineer would have designed the microphone to perfomer like this..."" I found the book very disappointing."
3,Somewhat predictable.,"The set-up of two enemy units having to work together to escape an even more deadly enemy should have made for more suspense, but somehow you never doubted that it would happen and they would escape. The only interesting part to me was the side plot of Tinuva and Bovai, brothers who are sworn enemies."
4,Still good stuff,"This is a great story, if you can't get enough of the Riftwar Saga. It maybe time for Raymond Feist to move on though. He's a great writer and I'm sure can come up with a new theme at some point. Although he has missed before!"
1,"L.L. Bean, here I come!!","Well, you get what you pay for. And this tent was cheap. As we (not inexperienced tent campers) were pitching this tent, a seam ripped. We had to find a scrap of sail cloth and sewing utentils to mend it to keep it from ripping further. A stake loop just popped out as we were staking the tent, again ripping the material. Had to jury-rig that, too, to be able to use the tent. Finally, in a modest wind, one side collapsed, leaving the net roof exposed to the rain, resulting in a small pool in our tent. We got home last night, and I already have this ready to go to the Post Office for a refund."
5,Best ever,"This tent is really big! It is a dome tent, but more square than dome. All the poles are attached and there are only two poles to bring up the tent."
2,Don't buy for HD AV Dock!,"I know this has been posted already, but just wanted to reiterate. This remore won't work with the newest HD dock. Someone on Microsoft answers told me it would, but it turned out to be a misunderstanding. If, like me, you've lost the remote for your HD AV Dock, thereby turning it into an $80 charger, you need to buy the whole previous version dock and use the remote that comes with that. That one will work. The good news is that that dock can be had for about 9 bucks.Just wanted to maybe help someone else avoid the frustration of pointing that little remote at your dock, smashing the buttons and yelling, ""Why?!?""."
1,Doesnt work,This remote does not work with zune dock v2. It only works woth the original circular dock...im glad they are all so cheap cuz Im going to have tp buy the other dock now.
2,Zune Remote Shock,"I bought this item from Shopcell describe as ""New"". The shipping cost more than the remote. It arrived pretty quickly in a small bubble envelope with no box, manual or invoice. It was shipped with no description or instructions. I was completely in a daze wondering what is this ugly looking thing and what do I do with it. It looked worn out and very depreciated. I almost just throw it away. Until I checked my purchase history and found out that I have to wait for the dock to be able to see if it even work. Thank you for the product description from Amazon. I hope the seller included a note or description of the item in the envelope to save me the aggravation. Make sense?"
5,life changing,"This book really opens the eyes of the people reading it. It is written with so much passion that it is impossible to not be apart of it and feel as if you know every character involved! It focuses on the important things throughout all the difficulties and celebrations...GOD! It makes you believe in the power in GOD. If you have forgotten and it, it reminds you, if you didn't know to begin with, it shares a lot of worthy information that causes you to ask questions and hopefully start to believe in the miracles and powers that GOD has. I thought it was excellent and I will read it over and over until the sequel comes out-I have to find out what happens!"
2,"Plot, No Characters","I have read quite a few of Kasey Michael's books but this one just isn't worth the effort. Very unlike her. I have read other of the Becket of Romney Marsh books and liked them, but this one just didn't ever ""take"". I confess I didn't even finish it. This is Spencer's story but his restlessness never seemed real, the heroine is a strong, capable woman who turns into a lovestruck, dithering idiot within two or three pages for no reason I could figure out, the whole smuggling plot line just didn't make any sense and then having Napoleon thrown in with everything else just made it all complicated. Too much war plotting, not enough characters. Lots of veiled references to the Becket's history, but nothing that seemed to have anything to do with the current story. I'd give this one a miss."
4,Liked it a lot,"I guess I'm really very opposite to most readers of this series. While many people gave the last three books four or five stars and loved them, I was hard pressed to give them a three and felt really disappointed by them. However, this one, where most people are giving it two or three stars or worse, I have to give it a four because I really liked this one.I do think part of my reason for liking this one is that it was the first of the series that I read, so, the whole history of the Becket family was new to me, so that kept me interested. Even though Spencer was a bit moody, I liked him a lot. Mariah was a strong female lead without becoming too annoying, too pouty or too shrew-like.It's possible that if I'd read a few of the other books before this one, I might not have had the same reaction, but of all the books, this one is my favorite."
4,Ball and Chain - Big Brother and the Holding Co.,This is a great video for what it is. There is not much out there with Janis on video. The video came in great condition. Looks and plays like new.
5,"""Never Again!""","Whoever reads this and other similar books should be saddened and shocked by the way that ""human beings"" could have ever acted in such a cruel, inhumane, and brutal manner. People all over the world must say ""never again!"" These books are an important part of human history. They represent real human sufferings beyond words. It is more tragic, however, to deny the sufferings; it makes a person heartless. It is pitiful, too, to see excuses made up to defend the criminals; it is shameless.All of those who deny the Japanese atrocities have the intelligence to know the truth. Like the Japanese soldiers who committed the crimes, they lack a human soul."
4,Great,A little scattered at first but a great book on the testimonies of the unit members from the exhibitions. Definitely a read for those interested in WWII history.
1,Lies aginst a grate people,This is all lies propagated aginst the Japanese culture using 4th and 5 th class doucments not even in book. Almost as bad as Rape of Nanking book lies.
4,At last the vail is removed,"I had heard of Unit 731 and the war crimes the unit committed plus the cover by the US Government after the Second World War finished.How the Japanese Government to this day does not acknowledge the terrible atrocities their troops from all ranks engaged.There were of revelations about Japanese use of Biological weapons,the numbers of victims, how many different units there were, complete with names and dates.This book exposed the whole sordid history.I never thought this units history would ever be printed!RegardsHagar"
4,solid! ....and oh so smoooooothhhhh,"If you enjoy hearing the clarinet, there is no better listen than this recording. It's very traditional New Orleans style jazz but Pete's playing is really spot-on and fluid. The songs are very complementary and showcase some very excellent guitar and fiddle work as well. Pete really shines on classics like ""Walking The Floor Over You"", ""Up a Lazy River"", and ""Basin Street Blues"". Easily proves why he may be the best musician to ever pick up a clarinet! His solos go from lightening quick to super melodic! Just an all around great CD to listen to and relax with. Definitely worth buying!"
1,Not an original,DVD not as advertised. This is a censored version of the original. It is not noted in the advertising.
4,"Good, would love a base too..","Will need to use along with parchment paper, simple technique.Would have been great if it had a base too.I use it on a cutting board."
1,Still waiting,"Item purchased 12/20/2007. First shipment, wrong item. Customer service said to keep it, and they would ship the correct item. Second shipment, wrong item. Customer service said they would ship the correct item and return packaging for the other item. I'm still waiting as of 2/5. I will say that I have another ""team mat"" like this one and I am very pleased with it."
1,started falling apart in less than a month,"I purchased these for my son, and they are already fallling apart, it's been less than a month."
4,Excellent Autobiography,"In the age of ham-fisted A. Goldman biographies and non-funny comedians getting publishing deals (that Faust would have refused) to write self-indulgent tripe, this book is a bit of an anomaly. It is funny and profound at the same time.It is also--for the purists--somewhat incomplete, as far as detailed information on various albums' bits, and I've read the galley proofs, which aren't that much more different from the finished product. But it's just as flawed as the man who wrote it, and the real truth is that we should all be grateful he was still around to do so.It has interspersed some of his old bits with Mudbone as the occasional narrator to give it some balance. It's honest and reasonably raw, and it is as they say, a page-turner."
2,I tried...,"I tried to give Pryor a chance and see what makes him do what he did. I'd read his daughter's book first and he sounded like a pretty violent and mentally challenged man. I figure there are three sides of the story, so I'll read the second side. This dude blew me. He joked about beating up women like it was justifiable, had no idea it was wrong, and continuously excused his own faults. When children do it, I can blow it off as just having to grow up and understand responsibility. But how can I respect a comedian who does so many things that aren't funny? I wasn't a fan of Pryor before I read his book and now I'm definitely sticking to that opinion. I did, however, enjoy his alter ego's anecdotes."
1,Not what is pictured/Save your money and time,"I should return it now. It is not a 'Zune' brand plug as pictured. It is a knock off and it did not sync my Zune, nor did it even act as a USB charger. Save your money and get a Microsoft brand Zune cable."
1,Was not usable,This cord fell apart the first time we plugged it into the Zune. Also it would not connect with the computer as it was supposed to do.
4,Zune cables,I ordered 2 new cables for my Zune so that if I lose one again I'll still be able to charge it! They came as promised and work well. They don't fit quite as well as the original cable so I am more careful removing it (it needs a gentle wiggle) but they were definitely worth the money.
4,not as pictured,"the item is not the authentic zune sync cable, which is pictured, but it does the job just the same. and for someone who has been without his zune cable for months and can't find one in any electronic stores anymore that is fine."
1,"Slow Sync, Doesn't Fully Charge, Not OEM",The original pictured showed the OEM cable but that is not what you get. The end that plugs into the zune is bulkier and the cable is a tad bit longer. My main gripe is that the sync time was extended by about 30 minutes and when my zune was completely dead this cable would not charge it back to life. Horrible horrible cable. Does not work!
1,bad experience,"The misleading description aside. This cable does not even work. the build quality was excellent its just that it shuts off my Zune instantly when i connect it to a PC, or rather my Zune shuts off to protect itself. a wiring short perhaps. the price is not worth pursuing a replacement. my broken original cable still works I may use this cable to repair the original cables missing clasp button."
3,Not exactly as shown,"The product shown is the original Zune sync cable. The product that I received was not what is shown. Although it does work, it is not an original Microsoft product. It's fit is a little bit tighter than the original. The finish does not match and it does not have the Zune logo. So although it does appear to function as a Zune sync cable it is not what was shown."
1,ordered 2 1 worked one did not,i ordered on for my self and one for my sisters mine works fine :) my sisters thought Looks slightly different and does not even seem to do any thing more then sit there uselessly except the random 2 seconds of charge
3,Misleading but gets the job done,"Gunna break it down into facts.The bad-Not what the picture shows.-Made from cheap but decent plastic.-No Zune logo or anything on it.-When I pressed on the button to make the hooks go in so that I can disconnect it from my Zune 120 it would come off. I had to mess with it for like 5 minutes trying not to break my zune. I finally pressed it as hard as I could when I got it off until both hooks went comepltely in. After that it worked fine.The good-It charges my zune and works fine like a real cable.-The price is awesome. So you can get one for your comp, car, work, anywhere."
1,Entertaining for sure.,"Damion should write a sequel to this book and include the disaster that was the Watts Tower in Birmingham, AL. His sugar daddy, Dan Pena, should co-author the next book with him. That is, if either one of them are still living in the free world."
5,WE love this!,"I have a labradoodle and i love this conditioner, smells good. great price for a gallon of conditioner that makes my dog's fur really fluffy and soft."
4,Perfect description,I was pleased with this pendant when I received it. The description online helped me to determine the exact size etc and it was very accurate. I didn't want anything to big or heavy and this item was perfect! The only dissapointment I have is in the chain that came with it. It is so thin that I wouldn't trust it to wear anywhere without fearing that I'd lose the pendant. We went out and got a more durable chain though and it's perfect!
5,I LOVE this book!,"We are now teaching my 2-year-old brother sign language. So I read this book. I think it is very informative on HOW to teach your baby sign language. When is a good time to start. And other things like that. She tells you the hows, whens, and whys for signing, while telling humorous stories about her own signing baby. It also starts you off with 60 signs. And if you look in the back it tells you where (in books and on the internet) you can get more signs!) All in all, I think it is a great book and interesting. Not boring at all."
2,"videos better for this, I think","This tiny book is compact and a neat little preface to any serious learning. There are several signs, but only a few of them for every day. A lot of signs are for animals and things--which are cute, but I wanted to teach more for every day communication/needs. Also, the pictures for the signs are pretty good, but there are a few that I would wonder if I'm doing correctly by the arrows--that's why I think a video might be better."
4,good basic book,"I like that this is small. The intro is not too long but I wish it was possible to just get a book with the signs (as others said, if we are buying the book we are planning on doing it so just get to the signs!). I have not had my baby yet so have not started using it but it seams well organized and clear."
4,Cute little book for an intro and handy for the diaper bag.,"If you are looking for a quick intro to info on signing with your baby and some great vocabulary to start with this little book is great for that. It is inexpensive and easy to pop into the diaper bag which makes it a great starting point if you are new to signing with your baby or if you want something short and easy to read for babysitters or relatives who wonder why you are signing with your baby or what signs you are sharing with your baby.If you are looking for something really comprehensive I would recommend the book Signing Smart with Babies and Toddlers, but for a quick and easy read and a convenient take-along book this one by Monta Briant is great."
5,Wonderful Sign Language Book,"We love this book! I started teaching my 14 month old sign language a month ago, and he can already sign ""please"", ""more"", ""no"", and ""All Done"". He is calmer and doesn't throw as many fits since he can ""talk"" to me. THis book is simple and easy to understand. There are so many new signs that I want to teach my son that I can't hardly wait until he learns one so we can start on another!! I would recommend this to any mother who wants to communicate to her children earlier. I will start teaching my daughter when she is about 6 months old and I can't wait to see how she does."
1,Not to fond of this book.,I ordered this with the thought it would be more helpful to me in teaching Shelby sign language. But it really disappointed me. I would not recommend this book to anyone.Linda DeGravelnm67@yahoo.com
5,Handy book,This is a very tiny book. But full of very practical information. I've heard so many good things about it from others too.
1,Disappointing follow up to Hear No Evil,"As a devout Feelies fan, I was psyched when I heard about Wake Ooloo, with Glen and Dave. Their 1st album, ""Hear No Evil"", picked up where the Feelies left off, with its hypnotic guitar licks and understated vocals. While Glen's guitar style can still be felt in ""What About It"", I think that the album has sort of a rushed feel to it. Still, a must have for any devout feelies fan."
5,Still my fave after 2 years!!,"what can be said about this CD that hasn't been said? well its so good i think ill say it again! CD 2 is where its at, building from the epic swelling strings of Adagio for strings... then straight into Another Day for a banging yet melodic journey through tranceland. As this mix continues it takes you higher, building the beats and breakdowns until you're physically tired from listening! then it soothes you with a couple of chilled out tracks before kicking into Airwave.. a track that noone clubbing in 99 can forget. Being lucky enough to live in Sheffield i regularly get to see 'crasher from the inside but almost everyone agrees this is the finest album. join the Discotech generation today!"
2,Could have been better,"If this was a $15 dollar game it would be worth every penny.Not a complete waste of money but not worth 40 bucks. The graphics could be better and a lot of bugs for a Lucas product. The story line isn't that great. The 500 processor requirement is a little low, at 600 if you have other things going on in the game (acid rain) then the computer gets freaked out what happens first. I really don't see a problem with that happening on a G5 but for the G4 people, I wouldn't get this."
1,I'm so disappointed,"Although the CD status is perfect and there is no scratch or break on it, It gives a lound rattle and undesirable noise on all the tracks. Most likely it is a recording problem. Actually i'm so disappointed regarding the quality inspection procedure Amazon is adopting. I want this CD badly but what i've found make me reconsider my future orders from Amazon. I tried to ask for replacement but i've been shocked when i found my self compelled to return the original CD to amazon at my expense."
3,Love this video BUT........,"My 22 month old loves this video! She loves Elmo & Katie Couric, and she loves dancing to ""So Much Better"". She quickly learned ""Jack & Jill"" and about ""The Three Little Pigs"". The only bad thing about the video is that it taught her to say ""No"" even more; she even says ""Elmo says no!"". And the video taught her the word ""MINE"". When Zoe asks Elmo if he would share his train with her, Elmo says ""No! Elmo says no! This train is mine, mine. MINE!"" So when we watch this video, I mute this section."
1,LIKE NEW - A JOKE,PLEASE LOOK AT THE DISK UNDER THE LIGHT BEFORE PUTTING ON THE WEB SITE FOR SELLING AND MAKE SURE YOU HAVE SOME ONE TO THE SHRINK WRAP ON THE ITEM SPECIAL DVD'S AND VIDEOS AND SOFTWARE.
4,wax guards,nothing special here. ordered these wax guards because I was replacing the foams on my Shure E2C earbuds.
1,Don't waste your money,I paid almost $70 for this battery and only worked twice. After the initial charge I could not get it to charge again. The company makes you pay for shipping and return shipping for a repair. Don't waste your money.
3,Warcraft d20 rpg,It's a fair to moderate representation of what a Warcraft rpg should be a little overpowered on spells and character info but other then that good just a little expensive.
1,Mistaken Identity,"As any WOW fan would know it is an online world full of advantture and role playing. The world is complex and difficult to learn for a newbie. So a book on how to navigate this complex world, full of hints and tips would be very helpful. Even at the heavey price of this book! Well this book with its hardcover and hundreds of pages of information does not have anything in it about the online role playing. It is printed as a optional board game for people who prefer playing a dundeons and dragons scenerio. This book is very misleading in its content and worthless to the online gaming fan."
3,Childhood Memories,"This story could have taken place in any city in the predominantly Polish neighborhoods. Every chapter brought visions of my own life on the East side in Buffalo, N.Y. Keith Maillard's portrayal of a typical family, whether they were first, second or third generations born in the USA, was so real and true."
4,Gave as a gift,It was a little smaller than expected. Otherwise it was a great gift for a friend that loves to watch hummingbirds
2,after 5 weeks of use,"the first night two out of 6 sceleton bars broke. From that time I had t fix it every second day with duck tape...PAINthe transparent plastic on the top waterproof layer cracked. I fixed it with duck tape.Used it at temperatures from 30F to 130F.other than that the tent is durable, you won't get wet in it.Just one thing; bring duckt tape with you on the trip..."
2,disappointing for coleman standards,"For a company known for their quality this is a disappointment. I have had this tent for a year now, and we camp as a family 4-5 times a year mostly in spring and fall. On two ocassions last year we slept through rain. Although the zippers and walls didn't leak or ""sweat"" the floor is where we have had problems. During rainy nights I noticed some water collecting in the corners. There was no evidence of leaks through zippers or any of the seams. Even in relatively dry conditions I have noticed that our underlay blanket is always wet, so I am sure the floor is where the water seeps from.On top of that two of the poles have snapped by now. One of the rear window poles snapped this spring, and one of the two large grey main poles split this weekend.The tent on the inside is roomy and has lots of pockets for storage, lots of mesh windows for ventilation."
3,Good But Ends To Soon.,"I Personally Loved this movie because of the idea that 2 massive super-storms would collide over an unsuspecting city and the idea of peoples daily lives going on as diasaters unfold. However the movie cuts out way to short leaving me hanging and wonder as to what would happen next, that is why give this movie a 3 star rating."
2,move on,"Not just a mediocre disaster flick, with badly digitalized special effects and characters one doesn`t care about, but also another feminist propaganda channel, where the two biggest heroes are women (the female journalist always ""wanting to do the right thing"" and the female secretary of energy), and all the villains being men. Villains because they are opposing the two mentioned females in one way or the other. And of course the tornadoes are feminists too, as all the villains die, and all the victims shown are men (the truck driver, the gambler etc).Two stars because I guess there are even worse movies out there, and the one star must be reserved for them."
5,Excellent!,"This book is one of the best books on the subject! The writing style is as clear as Widrow's ""Adaptive Signal Processing"" and it has as much detail as Haykin's ""Adaptive Filter Theory"". In short, if you have to get ONE book on the subject, this is the book to get. Perfect for either studying on your own or learning in a classroom setting, and relevant to both researchers and practicing engineers."
1,"Owww, I can't unread it!","This little number is not just poorly conceived and poorly written. If you're a fan of the meaning-laden fairy tale, this book will actually hurt to read. The characters thin and unlikeable and the story itself barely hangs together. The author fails time and again to make use of her own ideas, settings and her characters. The Disney influence on the plot is obvious here, and very heavy, despite transplanting the story to a modern/futuristic coastal area. Overall, this feels like a novel written over the course of a few weeks, without any real research or love for the story, and then quickly tossed onto the direct-to-school market or the paperback rack of the drugstore."
5,Poetic evocation of classic hollywood,"Guest is an important poet, but this book of prose sketches or ""movie stories"" can be appreciated by those who might not find their way into her more ethereal verse. What really comes through is a tremendously subtle sensibility both to language and to the visual arts, expressed with a sharp, intelligent sense of humor."
5,A Little Book With A Lot Of Meaning,"Abigal Thomas' GETTING OVER TOM is truely a delightful read. Full of short stories that are sure to make you smile, this book is a real winner when it comes to portraying life's many sides. Including everything from remembering your first kiss, your best friend from school, dealing with tough times, and even middle age, there is sure to be a story in there somewhere that will leave you touched. Thomas' writing style is like no others with her unique and quirky look on the world, making this book worth the while, and leaving you wanting more."
1,Maverick Heart,I had to force myself to finish this book. It was not the great quality and story line her other books have been. I was surprised that the charactors were dull and the plot was also dull. I wish I had saved my money! If you want to read Joan Johnston read another of her books and skip this one!!!!
4,A Four Star Read!,"Before you read Maverick Hearts, read The Inheritance prequel. Verity, The Maverick Heart heroine is connected to The Inheritance characters and will give you a broader background view. I would have liked to learn more about Freddy and her story, perhaps another book about her would have made a great series."
2,book SIZE,My order just came and was I disappointed. The book is beautiful yet the size is absurd. Measures 5 3/8 by 6 1/4 inches. This is not stated anywhere in the book desription. I just assumed it would be the standard 8 1/2 by 11 inches. I KNEW it wasn't the coffee table size but this size is just not suitable for this type of book. I will be returning it.
5,GREAT RECORD!!!!!!,"This is great album. All the songs blend together unlike ""Surfacing"" which was much more like a ""radio"" friendly album. THis is much like ""fumbling"" was. Check it out you won't be dissappointed."
4,Very Useful Product,"I like to have my camera available when I'm backpacking but trudging along the trail can really cause it to start swaying back and forth. I tried a number of home made solutions but nothing really worked until I found this strap. It's not uncomfortable, the camera is well secured, and it's a quick and easy job to get the camera in action when it's needed. The only draw back is that it does keep the back of the camera up against your body so if you are hot and sweaty the view finder will be misted over."
2,Not an Instruction Manual of Active Release,"This is merely an introduction to Active Release Therapy and its potential in the treatment of Repetitive Strain Injuries. There is NO INSTRUCTION on how to apply ART. Consider it promotional material for Dr. Leahy . The bulk of the book is made up of an overview of common Injuries (causes, treatment options, selected exercises and stretches). One has to train and test with the author to become an ART practitioner."
3,Good for info but not really helpful,"This is mostly an introduction into the world of Active Release Therapy and why it works and why you need it. It offers a few 'do -it-yourself'exercises and that is that!! the whole book in a nutshell. So, if you need to know more about the therapy , you will like it but NOT to RELIEVE PAIN!!I accidentally gave it 3 stars, 1.5 or 2 is more accurate****FOR PAIN RELIEF**********'The Trigger Point Therapy Workbook 2nd edition'is what you may want.We use it and find we don't have to take drugs most of the time. We both haveinjuries and we even have shown my 83 year old mom how to do techniques and it brought her relief...NOTE--get a theracane for those who are solo..they are available on Amazon and use w/ the Trigger Point book. The techniques are sound and they work."
2,Another disappointing computer from Compaq,"I full-heartedly agree w/ Jim G's previous review. I purchased a Compaq Presario 1.5 years ago and had several problems within weeks. I wouldn't wish their customer service on my worst enemy - they are abysmal, incompetent, and have zero bargaining power in terms of trying to fix problems. I had to ship my previous computer 5 times to Compaq until finally (and after at least 30 hours of my personal time making phone calls and writing letters) I received a new computer: the 2575. While it is better than the previous version, the battery life is atrocious, booting speed is circa-1997, and the noise from the fans must hit several thousand decibels.I am usually an easy customer to satisfy, but this is one company I am staying far away from (after numerous incidents)."
3,CD not included with book,We just got our copy and the CD was missing. The book seems thorough but the reference material is missing.Kind of disappointed.
3,Reads like Ferris Bueller's homeroom teacher,"Bueller? Bueller? Bueller? Jeez. I'm an admitted beginner at Flash, so I can't trash this book too much. I'm keeping it on my shelf because maybe, someday, I'll be advanced enough to need it. So, basically, all I can say is this: if you're a beginner, look at * Macromedia Flash Professional 8 Hands-On Training * from Lynda. If you're an intermediate or advanced user, you can ignore my rating and make up your own mind."
2,innacurate liner notes,"This compilation features some intersting mixes of HH hits. The liner notes are innacurate. The Hermit's did play on many of the bands singles including but not limited to ""I'm Into Something Good,"" ""Mrs Brown You've Got a Lovely Daughter,"" ""Show Me Girl, ""Henry the Eighth"" ""Listen People"" and more. The Hermit's were a great pop band and they deserve better from critics and certainly from AKBCO records. Lek Leckenby in particular was a gifted guitarist."
5,Factions Pre-order,The Insightful Spiritbinder is perhaps the most useful preorder item in the game. I defiantely recommend th purchase of the preorder kit if only for the in-game item.
5,Eclectic Collection of Gorgeous Music,"Absolutely treasured! This Japanese import is a wonderfully rich collage of their works over the span of a decade. For those who like their new techno-style dance music, this may not be up your alley. However, those who love the nuances of their older music will undoubtedly adore and savor this one completely. Highest recommendation!"
3,HomeoPet Joint Stree Relief Review,"The product seems to help my 12 1/2 year old Weimaraner. He has joint issues and suffers from stiffness. I can't say it's a miracle worker, but as part of the overall health plan, including various other supplements, it seems to be of value."
2,joint stress vs aspirin,I have a rottie that has hip issues. I gave this med to her for 3 weeks (twice a day) and wasn't that greatly impressed; maybe I should have given it more time. I tried giving her 2 aspirin. The aspirin worked just as well.
5,sizzler cooks,"Sizzler will work your body hard, without killing you, or making you want to give up. Denise does a super job of mixing aerobics, toning, and easy to follow dance steps. It's worth it!"
2,Not Authentic and Not Original,"The best: the blueberry muffin recipe is fabulous. The worst: the bread-and-butter pickles and dilly green beans are cribbed right out of Ball's canning guide, despite the folksy introductions. This book is a fun read but, if you're looking for authenticity (beware the Maque Choux recipe), look elsewhere."
3,Almost really interesting,"This book is a disappointment, but it was very close to good. The articles are mostly anecdotes and project descriptions by Wirth's students. I, too, was expecting more direct descriptions of Wirth's teachings. The glimpses shown here were almost enough, but in the end, unsatisfying.I'm giving it three stars. If you will do anything to learn more about Wirth, you should certainly read this. For general programming insights of similar ilk other books, such as The Practice of Programming or Meyer's Object-oriented Software Construction, are better places to look."
4,Great sound system,"Greate surround system with 7 channels and lots of power. WOnderful for hearing all the music and sounds on DVD's and TV shows, as well as playing CD's. Surround for theatre type experience"
2,BETTER AN WAIT THEN SORRY!!!!!!!!!!!,"Ya is great solid powerful system for less money. I have the older model of this system; bought it few years ago and LOVE it...is 6.1 version Great sound quality with big boom. But if I want to up grade mine to bigger watts and technology... Then, This new system comes with same power(watts) in pass two years old model's ,Don't comes with ""HDMI"" such as every important for most HDTV'S and DVD players Or DVDS Releases ,Coming out this year,like BLU-RAY OR HD-PLAYER,All HDTV'S since 2004, included with ""HDMI"" because of that too!. So I'm going to wait they comes out with HDMI,and bit better more power,Then buy this system, maybe couple hundred dollars more an this price, but would worth it, in long run!! This system with this power and Technology should be releases ""TWO YEARS AGO"" not in 2006 ,This is old news! Buying this system, Is just wasting money!!Save your money u do have now and bit more, for upgrade to new technology AV/system, in 2007 model!!!"
5,"Perfect replacement for a broken ""L121-2A"" door handle","I didn't realize it when placing the order, but this was an EXACT replacement for the broken shower door handle we inherited in our new home.If you're trying to match up a handle with a ""L121-2A"" code stamped on it, this is your item! (Neither the picture nor the product details mention the handle's model number, so I will.)"
3,Good Detective Story,"Peter and Rina Decker are two of my favorite characters, and it was nice to catch up with them again. A good detective story. Doesn't disappoint."
1,Peter Decker is on/off a mass murder case.,"My first Faye Kellerman book, and I feel it was a bad choice. Peter was the only character I had a feel for. His sexual harassment hearing after interviewing a prominent and beautiful witness/suspect was not believable. Rita's testimony was equally unbelievable. In short, the characters did not get developed, there was a lot of trivial dialogue and the transition from place to place, scene to scene, character to character was bumpy and at times confusing. (Let's see, where are now?) The overall plot was great, the build-up was good, but the climax was wimpy. From whence did the title come (I realize serpent's don't have teeth)? Any recommendations on what work captures the (I hope) real Faye Kellerman?"
3,Make your own ***** version,"Fundamental finds the Boys Being Boring. Buy the double disc version. There's an incredible single album buried in there. Their best since the Very years. Ditch the snoozers, cobble together tracks from both discs and burn yourself an album you'll wear out.I call mine Substantial. Here's my track sequence. It has style. Grace. Flow.1. The Sodom & Gomorrah Show2. Fugitive (from disc 2)3. Psychological4. Minimal (I l-u-v this song)5. Luna Park (their best mid-tempo ever. Sublime.)6. Flamboyant (from disc 2)7. Twentieth Century8. I'm With Stupid9. Integral10. Minimal (remix from disc 2)11. I Made My Excuses and LeftThere you have it. Ditch Indefinite Leave to Snore, Numb (you said it, honey) and PSB Fans in Hell (please, can we move beyond the off-Broadway show tune ballads?) Shuffle things up and you have yourself the best PSB album in years, if ever!"
2,Discordant Concerto,I am big fan of Anne-Sophie Mutter but this piece is a disappointment. Her playing is beautiful but the piece (which I did not know) is very discordant and I am not a fan of discordant music. This CD was a disappointment for me. It is the first Mutter CD I have not enjoyed.
3,"Fascinating, but Flawed","Akhenaten, the heretic pharaoh. He discared Egypt's gods for one. Then he was gone and he and mouch of the Dynasty he belonged to were stricken from Egyptian history. Where did this radical come from, why and where did he go? This book is the latest in attempts to relate him to the Hebrews. It seems logical. This could be the missing evidence for Hebrews in Egypt hiding in plain sight. But did he rule before, during or after? The author tries to make him into Moses, but his timeline doesn't fit the conquest of Caanan, which was before Akhenaten. Nevertheless, one can gleen many possible little details within about the Egypt-Hebrew history. In all likelyhood, the Hebrews left something that influenced Akhenaten. Too bad the author goes downhill in later books such as claiming Tut was Jesus. One has to throw out a lot of history to believe that. See alsoThe Stones Cry Out: What Archaeology Reveals About the Truth of the Bible."
4,best one source of information,"If you have cancer or know someone with cancer and you only buy one book to help keep you healthy, this is the book.Loaded with nutritional information pitched at just the right level to help you understand why you need particular nutrients at particular times and what doses. My only gripe. My book supplied by AMAZON was not quality checked and was posted to Australia with 8 pairs of blank pages starting at 162, 166, 170,174,178,182,186,190 so I have missed important information in Chapter 14 on recipes. I am sure this is not the only book in the print run with this blank page problem. I wonder what AMAZON will do about this problem.Other than this problem, the book is a mine of useful, applicable information and explanations. BUY IT!"
5,Essential Resource for Cancer patients,"I've purchased this book on two different occasions and given it to friends with cancer. It is a great resource for the recipes alone, and also the vitamin therapy that Quillan outlines in detail. The first edition I bought also came with an accompanying CD, which was very helpful. Nutrition is incredibly important in daily life, but especially a battle with cancer. Elaine Williams, author A Journey Well Taken: Life After Loss."
3,So-so,"I flip through this book every so often when someone asks me for cancer health tips. Although it's an easy read and has bountiful information, I do feel it may provide unrealistic hopes to cancer patients. However, keep in mind that you can never go wrong with a healthy patient.I am a huge supportive of carrot juice! Drink up (cancer or not)!"
2,Don't buy this it's overpriced,"Nobody needs 2 speeds to trim an animal. Get the single speed Golden A5 instead. This product does not include free shipping so it's about 50% more expensive than the single high-speed version. Also, don't but any extra blades until you try the #10 blade that is included. The #7 blade is almost identical and costs about $30. The price at over $230 is ridiculous. You can get these trimmers for less that half that price elsewhere."
4,I would recommend it.,"My main complaint is the #10 blade that is included with the clipper. It should be a #40 blade, because a #40 blade is designed to work with the plastic comb attachments that are marketed with this product.There is quite a bit of heat build-up after having it on for 10 minutes, but the plastic comb attachments keep it away from your pets skin, so I don't see this as a deal breaker.If you're going to use the clipper without one of the combs, I would recommend using it when you first start, or let it cool down before contacting the metal cutting blade to skin."
2,Should be better,"The Possum in concert! With stellar musicians behind him, this is a live CD that should be better - and a WHOLE LOT LONGER - than what it is. Chopped off songs - I just hate that in a live recording - live means LIVE! We wanna hear the crowd, baby! Hopefully, someday we'll hear an entire live concert from this legend on CD. There are a few gems here, but I gotta think his live shows are better than this handful of songs, even if they are some of his best hits."
4,A New Experience,"Not exactly new information, I still learned a lot. For those of us exploring new sides of our sensuality it is an excellent primer. I'd always been curious...and perhaps even more. Now I want to experience. Thanks for the starting point. I'm a lot less nervous about experimenting and a lot more eager to test the waters."
2,unhappy,"It was not informative enough, I expected more details pics if needed. Would not recomment to anyone who is just starting since I learned nothing from this book"
1,Worst Stereo EVER,"I bought this from a local store recently, and I don't know if it's just the model i picked out, but the system is very picky about the type of cd that you can play. if the screen printed label is even the slightest bit too thick, it won't play it, and reads no disc.I have a cd that i really like, and it works PERFECTLY on every other system I have, except for this one. I used to be able to fix the problem by just resetting it, but it just stopped working. I'm done with it. I'm returning it to the store and buying something else.DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. There's really high chance that it WON'T WORK."
3,MHC-EC77/EC55 operating problems,"I have purchased both models and have found them both to have similar issues with reading discs. Periodically, the unit will not read discs and fidgeting with the system by resetting factory presets, unplugging and replugging the unit sometimes clears the problem. Don't know if it is a dirty laser pickup or not but unit is in a clean environment and only a little over a year old. Unit will scan through 3-multidisc trays, and give a NO DISK message for each tray even though playable discs are in the unit."
1,"another victim of ""no disc"" error","I bought this unit because it's hard to find a mini hifi system w/multiple CD changer at a reasonable price. This unit appeared to be the answer, but it stopped playing commercial CDs after 4 months of use. I spent half the value of the unit sending it to Sony for repair using required packaging specifications, insurance, etc. only to have it not working again within 5 days of it's return to me. Completely frustrating. I strongly suggest that consumers look elsewhere for a similar product - this one appears to be a dud."
4,Works fine,"We're pleased with the unit. It doesn't have ""big"" sound, but then we didn't pay $400 for it, either. We had a Coby, then a replacement Coby when the first one died. When the replacement died (4 months) we decided to go back to brand names and picked this one because it is small enough to fit on the bookcase in my wife's office. She's happy with it."
4,Wonderful Product,"As all the Sony products I have bought in the past, this is Stereo is another example of satisfaction. The Stereo is easy to operate and I was very happy of delivery service. I only wish it had a cassete player. I just assumed that today's systems have all three, disk player, radio and cassette. I bought it for my daughter and she was very happy with the sound of the system. LoisSony MHC-EC55 Mini Hi-Fi Component System"
1,At least it worked for a few months,"This product was a disappointment. The cd player quit working after only a short time. If you're looking for a dependable product, keep looking."
2,what happened?,I purchased this at the end of October it is now the end of February and the unit doesn't work and my CD is stuck inside. I know that it was inexpensive but it still should last more than 4 months I am very dissapointed with this because I was trying to save money and now I have to purchase another one but it surley won't be a sony. I spoke with Sony tech support and they weren't able to help only to ask if the unit was plugged in and then to unplug it and plug it in again. As far as I'm concerned this was a waste of my money. I guess you only get what you pay for and I learned a lesson don't buy cheap
3,Sony Stereo,"The sound is good, not Bose but good. The reception however leaves a little to be desired. The included antenna works but the set has difficulty picking up some AM stations. Have not tried the CD portion yet.Ken Kaiser"
3,False Advertising!,"This product was shown with a tape player in it but when I received the product and unpacked it, there was no tape player in the unit. Apparently this was the North American Version with no tape player. I kept it anyway because it served my purposes and I didn't want the hassle of packing it up and returning it. However, I will not buy another product from your sight."
4,Christmas present for the hubby,This little thing has some kick! It is great and was cost appropriate. I would recommend!
3,Mini its not,"Let me start off by saying, all in all I'm happy with the stereo system for the money. It's a little larger than I'd like as I gave it to my wife as a gift for her to put in her office which has limited space. Also the FM reception is poor at least inside the office where my wife works. I'm planning on picking up an external FM antenna in the hopes that it improves reception. Sound quality is good and the remote is a nice feature but the controls are a bit confusing to switch between different functions. Maybe because we're over fifty, I have trouble with my cell phone at times. I would recommend this unit for anyone wanting to purchase a reasonably priced compact (I wouldn't call this a mini system) stereo system for a garage, workspace or child's room."
3,Okay but not what i expected.,"I bought this item for my boyfriend as a gift. It was great, looked new and audio was fine as well. The only problem was that he tried to connect the stereo to the computer and it wasnt working at all. We were dissapointed but overall it's worth the money i paid."
1,Boring,"I couldn't force myself to read beyond the first two paragraphs. Usually I enjoy reading Susan Shreve's books, but not this time."
2,Not good for the Business World,"Although this curriculum is great for learning different sentence starters, I would not recommend this for students who wish to enter the business/corporate environment. All of the fancy ""decorations"" that I was required to use when taking years of Andrew's courses have become so engrained in my writing that I cannot figure out how to write concisely. I work in the corporate environment in the Silicon Valley. Business professionals want writing to be short and to the point. My boss is constantly telling me that I'm too wordy when I write.I'm trying to break the habit. Unless you want a career that does not require a lot of writing, I would only recommend this course for learning different sentence starters."
5,An Exceptional Outdoor Furniture Cover,"I purchased this cover for my outdoor glidder, which measures 51"" long by 31"" wide, and am very satisfied with it. The cover appears to be made of a durable, high-quality material, and its neutral pebble color blends perfectly with my residence. Before purchasing this item, I read most of the customer reviews on Amazon.com for similar products and, after noting that customers almost universally rated products supplied by this manufacturer highly, decided on it. I think you will find it highly satisfactory, too."
5,THE BEST SEAT COVER!,"THESE COVERS ARE THE GREATEST!! I really can't rave enough about them. They are strong, durable, stand up to the wind. The colors are nice with beige and brown. They have a draw string and also clip together to hold onto the legs. It will not fly away. The covers are strong enough so that the rain does not get on the pillows, it doesn't even blow up in the wind like my other cover did that cost more money than this one. It is very nice looking and not like an eyesore that you so often see in the backyard, those ugly plastic covers that blow off (like the one i had last year lol. You have plenty of room for the love seat and i have about 8 pillows in there from the other chairs as well and it fits nicely. I am going to purchase the one for the table, i already have the one for the grill. I get alot of compliments on these covers!"
1,This album needs major help!!!,Back in the day Bally was good but this a sad attempt at recapturing what he once was as a remixer...time to hang it up and hit the private party circuit chap.
1,BOOTLEG ALERT!!!,"This is such an obvious HK bootleg it's not even funny. Why is Amazon allowing this to be displayed like a legit product?? A 49-episode series on 4 discs???? Hello????If you want to fork your hard-earned money over to bootleggers, hey, be my guest. But with 49 episodes squeezed into 4 DVDs, the picture quality is bound to be horrendous. This is NOT the way to enjoy this unique Gundam series."
3,Pretty Good,"This book has its highs as well as its lows. While it covers most of the main characters and quite a few lesser known characters, there are some huge omissions. X-Force, X-Factor, and Excalibur are mentioned NOWHERE in this book. If a character was on one of those teams, the book skips over that part of his or her history. And while it nice that they include a lot of obscure morlocks (though most without any written description), obscure Acolytes, etc., more well known characters (but still a little obscure in their own right) like Strong Guy, Shard, D-Ken, Mondo, Master Mold, Game Master, Revanche, X-Treme, Red Lotus, The Nasty Boys, Silver Fox, Mutant Liberation Front, Jean Grey's makeshift X-men members, some members of the Starjammers, some members of X-Factor, some members of Excalibur, etc. are also omitted from the book. Instead of wasting 13 pages on X-Statix, they should have added more characters and expanded some bios."
1,Theo Klein toy Swiss Army Knife,"DO NOT SPEND YOUR MONEY ON THIS TOY...cheap looking, low quality...give it a 1 star rating.I returned it. bought it for my grandson for christmas, I would embarrased to give such a gift to any child."
2,Food does not stay warm,"I thought purchasing a ""Thermos"" brand would be different, but I am disappointed once more. Quality of the product is very low."
5,Great thermos!,"I have used this thermos so far for oatmeal or for scrambled eggs, so I can't really comment on the leak-proofness, although I suspect it would be just fine with something like soup. Keeps my breakfast hot to warm for the few hours that pass between making it at home in the morning and eating it at work. It might even keep food warm longer than that, I just haven't tried. Quality seems good and the number of uses so far and suspected longevity will far outweigh the cost in the long run."
2,"one year later, it leaks","I bought this to transport soups and stews to work. It keeps things hot for 4 hours if it's full, but mine has started to leak, and I don't like the plastic lid (that probably has BPA) sitting so close to my hot soup for 4 hours. Going to retire it and get an insulated Klean Kanteen."
2,Design Flaw,"For retaining heat this works as well as any I've tried...My application is for overnight cooking of Irish Oatmeal: Prior to bedtime: Preheat the bottle, then place 1/2 C. of steel cut oats, fill near to top with boiling water. Go to sleep. When the alarm rings, seemingly 3 milliseconds later, one has cooked oatmeal waiting! (vs. cooking for 1/2 hour when you Could Be doing something else like reviewing vacuum bottles)This bottle's defect, in my opinion, is that the seal is integrated into what is normally the outer lid. (i.e. the cup or bowl of the vacuum bottle.) Also, the lid is easy to cross thread. The consequence is that one's hand must work at a high preload as well as high torque to unscrew it. Result: Frustration, possibly muscle strain.I prefer a different thermos (the one with the folding spoon in its lid):http://www.amazon.com/Thermos-Stainless-King-Food-Midnight/dp/B0017IFSIS/ref=cm_cr_pr_sims_tone can find these at WalMart for $15.88 in the camping section (10/25/09)."
1,defective,The cartridge that I ordered was defective and had to be returned. In the past I have had no problems with this product.
1,Cartridge is NOT compatible with MP210,"Be careful...Amazon's ""Find your Printer"" service on this page incorrectly lists that this cartridge is compatible with the Canon PIXMA MP210. It is not! Although my review is not about the cartridge per se, I give it one star to alert other of Amazon's faulty compatibility listing for this cartridge so you are not inconvenienced by their error."
3,Canon CL-51 High-Capacity Color Ink Cartridge,The cartridge has been installed for several months and colors are good. I haven't printed many pages to test the capacity but most people should be satisfied for the price.
2,Can not import properly from Quicken,"iBank seems like a good alternate to Quicken for a Macintosh computer. It clearly states that it can import data from Quicken. However the accounts and categories that it does import are incomplete and much of the data is unusable. Tech support is available by email but not by phone. They attempt to be most helpful, but in this instance they have so far been unable to correct the errors in the imported data. Starting out from scratch with iBank would probably be a good option. However, if you have previous accounts in Quicken it's a lot of work to start all over again especially since the program is supposed to import all of your date. I'm still trying to solve the problems but I may have to wait for Quicken 2010 for the Mac which is due in February 2010 and see if it meets my needs."
2,ibank first few weeks,"Decided to try ibank since it was made for the mac. It is not as user friendly as microsoft money, which I had used before, and seems to be a bit slower to respond than other some of my other programs. Hopefully when I get more used to it, it will come more naturally. The price was good.iBank"
2,Beware - you can only print full pages of 3 checks,"In other words, if you have one or two checks that you need to print off of the page of three in the opposite (i.e. landscape/sideways) format this program will not work. The only way to make it work is to scotch tape the checks onto a blank page in the exact proper position. That was the emailed advice from tech support for the software because this program won't work with partial check pages. It would have worked for me otherwise, but this glaring omission forced me to return the program."
2,Good checkbook and bad portfolio and reports,The title says it all.Banking is good. Portfolio management and report modules are poor. Some screens need revising. Importing from Quicken/Mac was no problem. They have a chance to take the market if they create easy to use reports and interface with more major institutions such as Vanguard and NetExchange.
4,"Fine Product, Good Support",I initially couldn't unlock the program. Turned out the wrong access code had been attached the the disk envelope. Emailing Ibank's site resulted in a speedy resolution of the problem. People there seem to be very supportive and helpful.Program operates smoothly. It's always painful starting and transferring data. However it looks like it will be a welcome replacement for Quicken. Setting up accounts and portfolio very straightforward.
2,OK for first-time financial app users,"I downloaded the trial version of iBank 3 because, like others have mentioned, I am getting tired of Quicken. I've only stayed with Quicken because there wasn't anything else that came close and/or would import my Quicken data easily. iBank is not the answer either.If you are a brand new Mac user and/or have never used Quicken and you are starting fresh, and don't need to download your banking info from your bank website (mine is not even included), then you will probably love this program (thus the 2nd star). Quicken users, however, are going to give up on this fairly quickly unless they have way too much time to waste, or don't mind starting over from scratch.Guess I'm stuck with Quicken for another year. At least I'm not experiencing the crashes others have mentioned. But I don't download anything from the internet into Quicken except to import my Morgan Stanley portfolio into TurboTax."
2,After-the-sale customer service was very difficult to find.,"I bought iBank and encountered a problem setting up my accounts. I wanted to edit an account on which I had made a mistake, but was unable to figure out how to do the correction.When I tried to reach customer service I couldn't find the path to any help from the program's creator, or any designated sources of help.I will never even consider purchasing from the iBank folks again."
4,enjoyable AND necessary reading,"It is refreshing that an author has been brave enough to tackle this subject in an honest way. So many of today's books dealing with terrorism are distorted by what some call ""political correctness"" and others call ""multiculturalism."" Jihadists don't believe in multiculturalism. They believe in monoculturalism--theirs.If you want the facts behind the fiction, read While America Sleeps: How Islam, Immigration and Indoctrination are Destroying America from Within."
2,"Bought-it, Tried-it, didn't work, not impressed!","I read many reviews before buying this product from Amazon specifically to repair damaged Wii games. This product did not come with paper instructions. Only directions on each bottle label. After following the directions and repeatedly polishing and cleaning 1-Disc several times, the scratches were not buffed away and the gloss was removed from the game disc. The manufacturer claims that CDs and DVDs are repaired, cleaned and polished but did not do come close to that for me. The 2-stars is that amazon allowed me to return it soon after I recieved it."
1,Push the button and watch the pretty lights turn on,I concur. I wish I would have read the reviews before I bought this piece of crap. I think the lights just turn on whenever you push the button. There's probably no wireless network sensor inside at all. Just a button and lights. Totally worthless. The folks at Kensington probably did a cost analysis and determined that they could manufacture and sell enough of these jokers to make a profit before people caught on that it didn't do anything.
3,Unpredictable.,"If you buy it with that caveat in mind, you won't be too angry to find it will not find a lot of networks at all, and that its estimate of signal strength is none too accurate. Despite that, I've found it's worth having in my bag, as it will find most pay-per-use networks such as those in hotels and airports."
5,Manufacturing Engineering Handbook,"I found this book to be well-organized and easy to read. It is a quick and easy-to-use reference for engineers, and covers a wide variety of manufacturing operations issues. I think it would be a great resource especially for senior students planning to enter the workforce, and professional engineers in the automative, aerospace, and plastic molding industries."
2,Started out as a promising novel!!,This started out as a great book but as the story goes on I find it pointless to tell. The Mom is not a very great parent and the lessons she teaches her son is just ridiculous.
5,I love this book,"This was my favorite book when I was a teen, I loved reading urban books and this here was a great read I made the whole family read it."
3,A HUSTLERS SON,The book left me with a big question mark.I believe mother and son should be close but this was scary almost like an obession of one another.Im going to read part 2 maybe it will give me a better understanding of it all!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3,Nothing like I thought it was gonna be...,"OK, this book was nothing like I thought it would be. It was a very strange relationship between a mother and son. I didn't like the way she did a lot of things with and/or for her son. But it was a good book."
2,TRASH IT!!!!,"I heard the song ""Heartbreaker"" And it stinks.But I do Like the video. Ever since Miriah and her husband got a divorce. She jumped out the closet and became a FREAK!!! Mariah is selling her body than her music. Straighten up Mariah, because that song is going nowhere, but out the window. That's ""Tele Tubbie"" Music. Put some clothes on, and get out there and sing like back in the day GIRL!!!!"
2,Ugghhh...Sorry Mariah!,"Mariah Carey's Heartbreaker is a cross between Fantasy and Honey, she is doing a lil of each and I don't think she should. Her falshettos are getting weaker and weaker each time I hear them...Heartbreaker is pretty horrible song!"
5,"SUPER SINGLE FROM THE DIVA OF THE DECADE, MARIAH!","This has got ot be Mariah Carey's best single ever! Heartbreaker is a great, upbeat song. And Jay-Z's rap makes it even better. The first track on the single is the album version. The second track is the remix with major rappers , Da Brat and Missy Elliot. It has a lot of soul and hip-hop on it. And if you watch tv a lot like me, then you had to see the fly video to this great remix. The final three tracks are my favorite. They are the club remixes. The extended ones! No radio edit jumbo! All of them are really orginal and showcase Mariah's original, beautiful voice. What I love most about the culb mixes is that they have samples fromt he 70's hit ""If You Should Ever Be Lonely"". So you get a great 70's song combined with the best 90's song (Heartbreaker, ofcourse!) If I were you, i'd get the maxi-single right away, cause they won't make them for long. And trust me, you 'll be so glad you did. The remixes are so amazing!"
1,"Awful stuff, this...","Mariah Carey continues to squander her strengths on beat-driven tracks with watery arrangements. Though it was commendable that she broke away from the balladeer role that she'd perfected from the very onset of her career, her voice is simply not suited to energetic, brainless dance music. Her depthless lyrics don't tend to help very much. ""Heartbreaker"" follows the same formula begun by ""Dreamlover"" and continued with ""Fantasy"" and ""Honey"", breaking absolutely no new ground while sounding pretty boring indeed. (Her rumoured upcoming movie role, on the other hand, promises to be interesting)I wonder when she'll realize, looking back, that the best up-tempo song in her whole catalogue, blending her strengths (vocal power, muscular arrangements to back up that power) and influences (soul, gospel, pop, rock), is ""There's Got to Be a Way""?"
5,Filter is best,"I would recommend any K&N filter to any automobile owner, its simply a great investment and better than those paper made ones. Gives your engine better response and once maintained properly, you have no worries with your car's air needs."
2,Feeble when compared to the originals,"What I wanted was a digital remastering of the best of Percy Faith's original latin issues. What I got was his still magnificent orchestrations, but shoddy engineering and occasionally embarrassing musicianship.The trademark crisp percussion under Percy's baton now seems a little muddy in all tracks. The brass solos in Granada used to smoke, here they stumble. Engineering? The harpsichord solo is so anemic in Tico Tico and Delicado it can barely be heard above the orchestra, even when the only orchestra is just a soft bongo. Remember the snappy finger snaps in Chiapanecas? Better turn your volume up.Okay. There are some good moments. I guess I'm just too familiar with the original vinyl albums. Unfortunately the only ""best of"" Percy Faith reissues slight his latin albums. So this is your only choice if that's what you want. Anybody know where I can get a bootleg of the original Malaguena?"
2,looking for the original Faith,"Long time Faith fan and LP collector since the early Coca Cola Shows (rainbow@infolink.com.br), I find the originals only on imports from Columbia (UK)where 2ON1 releases include Mexico/Brazil`s #4871922. Re mastering and sound engineering are not for Runwood beginners."
1,"Doesn't work with Windows 7, 64 bit","This won't work with newer versions of Windows - I have Windows 7, 64 bit. It won't sync with Outlook. I returned the product."
1,No 64 bit support,"Don't buy this if you have a 64bit system, They expect you to spend $100 more for the executive product to get 64bit support. I'm returning what I bought and will be purchasing someone elses product."
4,Worked great for me!,"I bought the Cardscan personal version with some trepidation after reading all of the one star reviews mixed in with the good reviews...I guess the bottom line is that if it works with your system it really works. For me, it's absolutely amazing. The only hitch I had was getting the scanner to work when I tried to scan my first card. I called tech support and they guy explained that if the scanner is exposed to too much light it may not read correctly. I had the thing sitting on a window sill in my office so I moved it to a spot in the corner away from the window and now it works great. I scanned about 300 cards in an hour--the scanner had trouble with some weird fonts and layouts, but the vast majority of cards (>90%)were scanned quickly and accurately. I wish I had bought this six months ago. I'm running Windows Vista, but apparently not 64 bit? All I know is that I just cleared up a massive pile of cards and threw away two rolodexes--whoopee!"
1,Not user friendly with outlook,"If you think this is simple to use with outlook, you are wrong. There is no easy way to send files from this dang machine to outlook. I wasted an entire day trying to figure this thing out"
5,Excelente Produto !!,"Ha anos estou tentando organizar meus cartoes , comprei o Cardscan e nao me arrependo . Ele escaneia, le o conteudo , faz as correcoes , armazena no computador e no site do fabricante, cria catalogo de enderecos , sincroniza com meu outlook e com o Palm Treo . Nota 9 , so nao eh pq e P&B e nao color !"
4,Just what I wanted,"It works very well. A little complicated at first, but worked out to my satisfaction. I like it."
1,Good for about 30 cards...,"So after scanning my first batch of cards (which it worked great for), the scanner simply stopped working correctly. It couldn't be recalibrated and won't read any more cards. I called tech support only to learn that this is a known problem, there is no fix available and that it's likely due to their outsourcing of the manufacturing of this product. I'm returning the one I got and I'd strongly recommend against getting one until the quality issues are resolved."
1,Not Windows 7 compatible,"This proved to be a worthless paperweight, due to the fact that it in not comaptible with 64 bit operating systems. This is pretty hard to find in the product description, and not something you would expect for new merchandise."
3,Nightmare!!! But still usable.,"I purchased and spent half my day scanning cards. Worked great until I got to the point where I would actually utilize the data, only to find out that it will not export to my 2013 contact management program (ACT! 2013). A thorough search discovered the company never developed an upgrade for the software, after an hour of frustration I decided to try to export as ACT!2000. It created a .txt file which ACT! 2013 will import. It actually worked just fine, but it sure would have been nice to have a note or even somebody on the web that pointed out, just because it says ""export to ACT!2000"" doesn't mean the file won't be compatible with ACT!2013."
1,Crap Sandwich,"I purchased this several years ago when I was Windows XP 32 bit. My work laptop was updated to Windows 64 bit and the cardscanner then no nonger worked. It was never mentioned in the small print, large print, or any other print that this would only work with Windows 32 bit OS. This was my newest piece of hardware, but the first to go obsolete because DYMO stopped supporting this product only one year after my purchase. Their customer service sucked when I called about the compatibility issue.And just fyi, don't buy the updated model either. It is not compatible with Outlook 64 bit, which makes that one useless too, for me anyway. I just returned that."
1,Not Compatible with Vista 64,Very frustrating...The CardScan Personal is not compatible with Vista 64. There is no sales info out there that states this and there are no informed sales folks about this.Vista 64 has been out for at least 18 months and this hardware has been out less time than that.It is just a bad setup and there is no excuse for it.
4,Feedback on CardScan Personal,"It is not my habit to advertise my purchases, however this product and service features coming along with it are worth it.Scanning your bus.cards this way saves an enormous amount of time, and being able to view all contacts worldwide via a weblink is simply great.Point for improvement: some companies are so creative in their bus.card lay-out, that the scanner has some difficulty putting text and titles in the right places. Confuses me too sometimes.Real recommendation!"
3,SO SAD,"This book was so sad. My heart broke for this leading character. It was well written and I like that it didn't have one of those ""fairy tale"" happy endings - this book was more real. I look forward to reading more from this author. Good job!"
3,too depressing and WAY too slow for me,"I read the summary and knew that it wasn't going to be a cheerful read but this novel was really, really a downer. It was slow and just never picked up the pace for me. The grief was the anchor and just hard to lift."
2,Good color but crappy quality!! Not recommended,"Put them on a 2008 Subaru STI in the high beams which are sent partial voltage when my headlamps are not on (during day driving). I purchased them August 29th, 2012 and the driver side bulb burned out September 21st, 2012. Not a very long life when they are rated at stock voltage...For the price, which I guess you could say was cheap, I might try them again only because I like the color, but I would not recommend them to anyone else.TWO(2) STARS search for a better solution."
3,"Great content, BUT...","In terms of content, this is fabulous. I was familiar with the authors' recipes from Country Home magazine and was so looking forward to cooking from their new book. BUT. Who in their right mind approved the size and format of this thing? It is absolutely and totally ill conceived for practical use in the kitchen. If you just want to read the recipes and pretend that you are eating all that glorious food, OK. But if you want to put this book to use in the kitchen, forget it. I am so frustrated!! Let's hope the authors, designers and the publisher come to their senses when they put out the paperback edition!"
5,"Great saw, don't let the low price fool you","Having own cheap-quality saws in the past, I was a bit skeptical when I saw this one, but for such a low price I decided it was worth a try. I was very pleasantly surprised with how quick and smoothly it cuts. I would almost say that it cut a little too fast, but that's just because I was so used to how slow my older saws cut. It took some getting used to, but now it is one of my favorite ""sawdust makers""! :)"
2,Where's the mandolin?,"I was really looking forward to hearing this disc...Like most, I LOVE 'Dance with Me'. I like that the disc starts right off with it. Sounded great when I first started playing the disc...vocals and harmonies, fantastic! The audio, crisp and clean...so far, nice! As the song progressed and built up to my favorite part (the mandolin solo) I got my 'air-guitar' (or should I say 'air-mandolin') out and....what happened? No mandolin? Are you kidding me? Their big comeback gig, they couldn't get someone to play for them? I actually stopped listening at that point and put it away. Maybe some other time I will venture back and check out ""Still The One"" and the rest, but right now I am still bumming...no mandolin? Just don't get it!"
5,Must Have Book for Sports Photographers!,"Excellent book detailing the ""must haves"" and ""must knows"" for the budding and experienced sports photographer. Interesting to read how this photographer made it in the sports photography field and very informative as to how to continually improve and expand your photography business. This book is full of beautiful photographs and is very inspiring. As racing photographers, my husband and I learned a lot from this book that we can apply in our specific field of photography.Sincerely -Nikki Snodgrass ProbertBelton, MO"
2,Too High End,"While this book claims to be for a broad variety of photographers, it seems more oriented towards those career-oriented people who want to shoot pro sports and make money at it. I am an amateur photographer who wants to learn to learn morea about digital photography and take pictures of sports, but I found it hard with this book to figure out how to best take photos with my camera, which isn't professional equipment, and then what to do with the photos. The author has some good experience, although it would have been nice to have a wider perspective of both photography as well as various types of sports--not just the big, typical ones. It's interesting to read about this kind of photography, but isn't that practical, at least for me. I have a reasonably good but simple digital camera, and I'd like to know best how to use it to take sports photos and then do something with them ... but I didn't get that from this book."
2,Not very good.,"I had high hopes for these speakers and I was very let down when I played them for the first time, They are very ""bassy"" not in a good way and not much clarity in the sound. If your a person like me who prefers good sound quality I wouldnt recomend these, other than that they work fine, I use them with my 80 gb zune and yes it does fit you just have to remove a piece so they will (its designed for thhat purpose). I will probly be selling mine before my deployment is over, they just aren't worth it to me."
2,2nd Gen Zune doesn't work with this item,"The description should be rewritten to emphasize that the 80 Gb Zune will not fit into the dock. I own an 80 Gb Zune only, and as a previous review states the IPod has the market locked down, and when I saw this station with this awesome price I jumped on it. Now that I have the product I realize it doesn't work. This is a bummer. Just to let people know."
4,"Awesome sound, great volume with quality sound",We are very happy with this addition to our Zune. Good quality and super value.
1,Buyer Beware!,I unfortunately ignored the other reviews that complained they couldn't get this device to work. I spent 2 days trying and finally gave up and sent it back. Bought the less expensive 414 model instead. That one works and sounds great!
4,Great Product,"My kids love their Zunes and wanted a speaker system for Christmas. After reading the reviews and researching this system online, I decided to buy it through Amazon.We are all very pleased with this system and the quality of sound it produces given its size. Plus set up was very simple.Definitely recommend this item."
2,disappointed,"I purchased the m604 several months ago as it seemed to be a reasonable alternative to the more expensive Octavio system. That said, I wish I had saved my money. While the sound is quite good, the system has serious operational flaws. The sound starts out just fine when I initially place the Zune in the dock, but after some short length of time, the unit makes an awful clicking noise and must be shut down. This happens without fail every single time I use the speaker system. When I contacted Altec Lansing, they offer no assistance or advice. Based on my experience, I cannot recommend the system to anyone else."
2,Wrong actress and wrong synopsis,"I collect Judy Lee aka Ling Chia movies and despite the description , the 'Chase"" has some other actress ( perhaps her name is the reverse i.e. Chia Ling ) in it and the synopsis is totally different to the description . I was so disappointed that I didn't even bother looking at both movies - its at the bottom of my ""to watch"" list . The only plus I suppose is it's got 2 movies in 1 case ."
4,Lost potential,"I found this band on Pandora. Shame they didn't do very well (despite some initial hype) and disbanded early on.They have a great Doves/New Order, somewhat shoegazey sound. The album is well produced and the songs are fairly well written. It's very gripping and catchy.It's nothing amazingly extraordinary or brand new, but it is very very good. Recommended."
3,Looks great - Needs better quality control,"We received the first toaster, tried it out and everything looked great. Next morning the left two slots would not come on at all. Amazon was great, shipping another toaster out immediately. Second toaster works okay makes consistent toast, but on the left slots, we have to adjust the control to between 8 and 9 to get the same degree of browning as we do at 5 on the right two slots. For a toaster this expensive, it is disappointing. I would not purchase again."
4,Wonderful addition to our kitchen,"I purchased this toaster after visiting my daughter and using hers. I was sold on this toaster because of the bagel setting which is great. It has a very nice look and does a great job. Toast seems to be crisper. The price made me think for a while before purchase but I am really happy I went ahead and bought it anyway. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because of its size. I could hide my old toaster but this one has to be kept on the counter. I was surprised at the weight as well but, since it has to sit out anyway, its not a problem. I would recommend this toaster to anyone."
5,Very pleased with our new Toaster,This toaster makes excellent toast. It evenly browns on both sides. the stainless steel finish and controls layout are pleasing to look at. The openings are larger than a lot of toasters and therefore accepts thicker slices with ease. It would be nice if it had the feature that when the toast pops up you can lift the handle up to expose the top of your toast for easy removal. In this day and age it is just nice to get a toaster that browns evenly on both sides. I would buy this toaster again.
2,Cheap Shoes,"Propet shoes seemed have gone, as many products these days, down hill. After wearing these shoes for two days, they started to hurt my feet."
1,Fertility Traitement,"I'd try this product for 6 months more or less but i didn't see changes or effects positives to have a baby, i don't feel specially different or a remark to say is working; then i let other people with this kind of situation to try it and have their own experience."
5,Great series of books,"I've been using the Life Guide series of Bible Study Guides for several years. Subjects are always well done with questions to lead the group to the point of the study. I've tried others, but Life Guide is far-and-away the best subject studies out there."
1,Where is David Morales?,"Big mistake - using Junior Vasquez instead of David Morales, who has a proven history of success remixing Mariah's songs."
1,EXCELLENT,"I don't know what I would do if Mariah stopped recording, i love her music its upbeat, personal and her voice is so amazing. Heartbreaker is such a catchy song and the video is so greattoo. I can't wait till Rainbow comes out!"
2,Flattering only if you're rail thin,"First things first, this item is NOT ivory, but just plain white.Secondly, it's not made of satin, but of some sort of cheapish, smooth-feeling polyester.Thirdly, I'm 5'8"" and 135lbs, and it looks absolutely terrible on me. I ordered the S/M (which is usually my dress size), and the item is too short, and falls strangely so that when it hits what little lovehandles I have, it makes me look like I'm 20 lbs heavier. If I'd ordered the M/L to compensate for the length, the breast cups would have been far too large -- and I probably would not have resolved the issue with the dress making me look 20 lbs heavier.Return."
2,The real gold is elsewhere...,"The contents of this disc stems from Quincy's stint with his big band, a scholastic period(the 50's to early sixties)where he developed later to become one of the great arranger/producers of our time. His resume of colloborations with the stars of the day is a mile long. This low budget compilation will give you the slightest exposure to his gifted arranging talents. The set lacks any annotation or personel listing, recording dates(I assume late fifties)etc. The poor remastering delivers a watery sound on several tracks, not even close to the quality I'm use to from Columbia or Verve among others. Do yourself a favor and track down these same recordings from another source and I'm sure it will be much more gratifying."
4,A fine collection of little-known chamber pieces,"If off-the-beaten-track chamber music is your thing, then you will enjoy this two-CD collection of works by Czech and Hungarian composers of the 19th and 20th centuries. I bought it recently for the unusual and rarely-heard Five Bagatelles for string trio and harmonium by Dvorak -- pieces I heard on the radio many years ago, and have looked for ever since. After renewing my old friendship with the Bagatelles, I began to make the acquaintance of the other works -- all of them new to me, and well worth hearing and getting to know better. The recordings date from 1989 and 1990, and Domus' fine playing is crisply captured. The liner notes are rather brief; but then this is a budget issue from Virgin Classics. It's great value."
3,Tweety & Sylvester's Crazy Christmas VHS Video,"Description from the back of the cover:Merry Twismis! Tweety & Sylvester's Crazy Christmas featuring GIFT WRAPPED TWEETY (starring Tweety & Sylvester) plus 2 other Christmas cartoons: THE CHRISTMAS VISITOR & STAR OF BETHLEHEM. Running time: 30 minutes, in Color, Made in the USA and distributed by UAV Home Video."
5,Tau Zero Redux,"Well, almost ""Tau Zero,"" one of my favorite all time scifi novels. Anderson presents another adventure in the same mode. Few authors write scifi like this anymore. There is a sense of wonder and a sense of uplifting the human spirit to greatness that you see in Wells, Verne, Clarke, Stapledon, Baxter, Benford, etc. The characters are all well delineated such as the affected hypomanic woman pilot who acts like she is an avatar of Robert Burns. The aliens are wonderfully characterized and multifaceted. One is also left with questions which are left unanswered, contributing to the sense of expansiveness. The book gives you pause to think about the big picture. In my humble opinion, this is what scifi should be, a kind of practical philosophy. ""Starfarers"" succeeds at this game admirably. Do not let the archaic language put you off; it is Anderson's tongue and cheek version of future speak!"
1,"Run, don't walk....","...from this car-wreck of a sci-fi novel.- Disorganized plot (if there is one).- Uninteresting characters.- Meaningless side stories which add nothing to the main ""plot"".Mr. Anderson, you owe me for the hours of my life I lost reading this terrible book!"
3,A Bit Too Long,"The premise of the book is interesting, but the writer should've kept out all the meaningless 'side' stories and characters which did nothing to further the plot. The depections of alien cultures was intriguing enough to keep me reading, but in the end the book fizzled out and I felt somewhat disappointed. If you really want to read it, I'd suggest checking it out from the library. It's not one worth keeping in your personal collection."
1,Really Discourged,"I watched the first minute or so and I was really discourged, it was like someone had filmed this from a TV set or something...the quailty of the picture is very poor, don`t judge a book by it`s cover...."
2,Disappointing....,"I was originally intrigued by the back cover comments of this book and the fact that it one the Bellweather Prize. However, I found it hard to follow and the author's view of a foreign culture to be disturbing in that she puts herself forward as a native expert, which she is not and could never be since being that she is North American and not Mexican; people who live abroad (like the author) often think they have a stronger grasp on a foreign culture and/or language than they really do.... I would be interested in a native-Mexican Spanish speaker's opinion of the book's use of Spanish.The beginning is quite detailed but the latter part of the novel skips over various events quickly and therefore seems more disjointed. Second, the white, North American author's narration in the voice of a Mexican woman makes me uncomfortable and I felt like I could not trust her view of Mexico. I found the constant use of Spanish throughout the book annoying and affected."
2,Biased,"Although the ideas presented are good, there is a definite bias to this book. It is presented in a way that suggests that black and Hispanic kids are the only ones who need this program, and that all black and Hispanic kids live in slums. Most of the writing examples are about inner city violence, drugs, and despair. The bias begs several questions: what about black and Hispanic kids who live normal lives in suburbia? What about white kids who live in slums? What about kids of all genetics living in all sorts of conditions? If you are working with the narrow demographic represented in this book, this book is for you. It would be more intellectually honest for the authors of this book to make this point very clear in the title or description of this book."
5,That's right,"This early 2600 game was indeed as simple as most others in terms of graphics and sound, but it had 27 different games. That's right...27 games of combat, be it tanks, biplanes, invisible tanks, bombers. With that ka-booming, abresive sound.A real early game treat, this was a 2 player blast with...27 game varieties. Not bad for the primitive 2600. And as always, that amazing Atari artwork is as inviting (and naturally misleading) as any of the other games."
4,"Good follow up to ""Killing me Softly""","New Orleans crime busting heiress/PI Saura Robichaud finds herself joining forces with a stranger she picked up in a bar months before in order to insure that crime kingpin Nathan Lambert is brought to justice for his many crimes, including the death of Saura's fiance. Detective John D'Ambrosia is a perfect match for the butt kicking Saura, and as they try to bring Nathan to justice, the two fall passionately in love.The second book featuring the Robichaud/Fontenot family (following Mill's brilliant ""Killing Me Softly"" featuring Saura's brother Cain), the bar has been set for the remaining two novels in the series (""A Little Bit Guilty"" featuring cousin Gabe Fontenot and ""Sins of the Storm"" featuring estranged cousin Camille Fontenot)."
2,Waste of money,"I have had a subscription for the past year and was extremely disappointed. I was looking for a magazine that would publish interviews of various painters working in various styles who would explain their techniques and experiences as working artists. I was, however, very disappointed. First, this magazine weirdly seems to be one long advertisement. That aside, the painters and pieces published are all based in realism. I have nothing against realism, but I was looking for a collection of diverse approaches. Something of a salon for painters. This is not what this magazine is aiming to achieve. This magazine would only be potentially useful for an inexperienced painter who is interested in painting classical realism."
2,Hmmm(?),"The author tries too hard to be a ""good writer"" in this book. I prefered to read more historical facts rather than commentary. his ""verbage"" is a little much at times."
5,Does the job well,I attached this to the side of a cooler. Works great together as a rod stand on the dock or in the canoe. Simple and effective.
5,Works perfect,I use this product on the side of my pier. Works perfect for storing my poles so I can easily grab one and begin casting!
1,Way way to expensive...,Apparently I didn't read the description completely.... One candle $14.00 is too expensive.. I will pay close attention the next time..
1,A waste of trees and time,"Media tie-in novels often get a bad reputation in the science-fiction community; it's books like DIVIDED LOYALTIES that bring that about. Characters are two- and one-dimensional, the plot is less exciting than the opening credits from the television show, and the prose itself would not be deemed publishable anywhere else.There are a lot of good media tie-in novels out there. This is not one of them. Try your luck elsewhere."
2,info re: Superthruster music video,"""The main video, Superthruster, [edited] ... who bear a striking resemblance to Sly and Robbie themselves. I wish I knew who animated and directed this video, and what other work they had done.""Produced at Wonderland Images, London, for Palm Pictures.Directed and animated by Alan Maxwell, Mark Khan and Stuart Love.According to a '98 Creative Review article, they were modeled Sly & Robbie, based on only two photos."
3,Strange,"Read this book and enjoyed it. Rather bizarre set of brothers. Not the best bio I ever read, but still entertaining."
2,Not What I Expected,"The subtitle of this book is ""The Strange but True Story of the Collyer Brothers, New York's Greatest Hoarders, An Urban Historical"" which led me to believe that the story would be exclusively about the Collyers. However, Lidz alternates stories about his own hoarding Uncle Arthur with some facts about Homer and Langley Collyer. While Uncle Arthur was an interesting character I didn't get what I was expecting from the book.Worth the 99 cents I paid for the Kindle version."
1,Disjointed,"While the Collyer Bros are mentioned, I can't seem to follow the author's scattergun approach to writing. This book is all over the place....starting many thoughts but finishing none."
1,Invest Elsewhere,"I'm not a fan of fiction, but interest in the Collyer's story led me to read My Brother's Keeper, Marcia Davenport's account based on the lives of Homer and Langley. Beautifully written, this book stayed with me for years until I tracked it down and added it to my personal library. Therefore, when I learned that Lidz had written a non-fiction account, I was eager to add it to my collection. I had to order it sight unseen, (entirely my fault) yet I looked forward with great anticipation to reading it. As I dove in, I was deeply disappointed with the way the story unfolded. (Not to mention the overall size and length of the book)Lidz barely scratched the surface of the complexity of their lives. I understand the personal parallels that led Lidz to intertwine his uncles' story with the Collyers', but frankly, if I wanted to read about his uncles, I would have purchased his other book. As a result, you get half the book (in length and story quality) for twice the price. ...."
1,NOT WHAT I EXPECTED,"The book should have been titled ""THE STORY OF MY UNCLE ARTHUR AND THE REST OF MY STRANGE FAMILY"" What's up with that? I bought this book to get some DETAILED insight to the amazing story of the COLLYER BROTHERS and what I got was in essence, a 150 page magazine article, mostly about the author's family tree. The story was totally glossed over with very little biographical information given. I guess I expected some kind of very DETAILED account and what I got, read like a bad novel. If you're looking to find out more info. on the Collyer Bros., try some websites,.....I would'nt recommend this book."
3,cute look and nice for a kid friendly kitchen,I bought this style cannister so that cooking with kids would be easy since they are not ceramic and won't break. The quality is just ok there is some uneveness to the lid and cannister although it still closes securely.
