3,Great sander...... until it broke,"I loved this sander. then one day it randomly stopped working. I am sending it back to porter-cable... hopefully they will get it back to me quickly. The sander was used in-frequently at best. I guess i just got a lemon***Update: Turns out it was my fault. i used the sander on drywall and this caused the problem..? I didn't know. Live and learn. Don't use this sander on drywall... apparently that voids the warranty, but they fixed it anyway."
5,Great book,The book itself is excellent and answered most of my questions. The depth of the book is in the supporting material. So many internet links to great content can take you months to read if you wanted to spend the time. Very intelligent in the layout. It gives you exercises to complete before you go to the next step and the exercises are designed to get you to know yourself as film maker and to get to know your equipment and tools (ie limitations). This book goes a long way in helping you realize yourself as a DV film maker.
1,Disappointed,"Bought this watch for my girlfriend, she loved it initially which made me happybut after a couple of months the color started to change. Now the watch is barely recognizable as the one I bought,She still wears it which makes me feel a bit embarrassed nowadays. I thought that it was of a better quality."
4,Cool Beats But a little short.,"I think this album is pretty good. It is only 34 minutes or so long and I personally will only call an album great if it is 60 minutes or so of quality ... Kid Koala is featured on track 9 (No Excuses) which is very smooth. I think track 13 (Alki Beach Drive) is the best. This album in general has some real jazzy funky-funky fresh groves and phatass beats, yo."
5,Highly Recommended,"Very instrumental, very smooth, very cool. If you're looking for something funky and something different, this is it. If you want the same old, look elsewhere."
3,I'm a bit frustrated with this,"I used to use a Bosch in a cabinet shop that I loved using.Since I have a lot of Porter-cable tools so when PC came out with this I thought it was going to be more like a gray version of the Bosch I loved with improvements. Since everyone is in competition with each other it must be so.When I had to change my first blade I was in horror. I think I have it down now but boy is it still a royal pain. I dread blade changes but I'm getting better at it. Maybe my fingers are just getting increadibly strong.It has a lot of power and looks great.Dust blower, nice feature, blows dust directly in front of the line you're trying to cut on.If I have to start using this more I might sell it on ebay and get a new Bosch."
3,Truly Dickensian but not a Masterpiece!,"With this novel, Dickens afionados will be glad to discover yet another one of his works. As may be expected, the plot is at once thin, convoluted, completely implausible and yet quite enjoyable. As usual, the characters are strikingly one-dimensional: for instance, Nell is beautiful and utterly good and Quilp is grotesquely deformed and perfectly evil. The author's characteristic tongue in cheek humour is pleasantly present throughout the book.Somehow however, things are not quite as polished as in better known works. For instance, narration switches in chapter 3 from the first person to the third, with a rather awkward explanation. A major character abruptly disappears about a quarter of the way into the novel and the reader is only briefly told what has become of him in the last pages of the book.Thus, those unfamiliar with Dickens would benefit in reading first one of his more famous novels such as Oliver Twist or Great Expectations."
3,"Classic Dickens writing, but not the best","The book is in a well written Dickens style withlengthy and beautiful description. But, I believe thatit started very slow and didn't get into some real actionuntil more than half way through the book. Although littleNell is very sympathetic and lovable, she didn't appeal tome as well as some of his great characters in other books.For the first half of the book, it lacked the beautifulinsights that Charles Dickens always made and which I lookfor and cherish in his works. The end picked up on thesepoints but not enough to make up for the entire book.It wasn't the greatest book by Dickens, but is still considerablybetter than most."
3,Not his best effort,"Full of gorgeous prose of course, but a very pointless and disappointing storyline, and strangely unsympathetic main characters (Nell and her grandfather). Many members of the supporting cast are much more endearing. One of Dickens' earlier works, and an outgrowth of the ""Master Humphrey's Clock"" periodical experiment, which perhaps explains some of its lack of cohesion. If you're new to Dickens skip this and go for Bleak House, Martin Chuzzlewit, or even Little Dorrit (wherein the devoted young girl and elderly father/grandfather theme is revisited much more effectively)."
3,One of my least favorite,"Although it is still an above average read it does not measure up, in my estimation, to most of Mr. Dickens' other novels. Try the following books first: 1- David Copperfield, 2-Nicholas Nickelby, 3-Little Dorrit, or 4- Bleak House."
3,A Mediocre Kindle Edition,"This is a review of the Kindle version of the Fictionwise Classic edition of Dickens's ""Old Curiosity Shop.""I bought the Fictionwise Classic edition (which is more expensive than many of the other Kindle versions offered of this novel) in the hopes that the higher price reflected better presentation. I was disappointed. This version contains no table of contents (linked or otherwise), no interpretive introduction or footnotes, and none of the contemporary illustrations. It is also lacking the foreword that Dickens wrote for a reprint edition done in his lifetime, and in parts it is rife with typographical errors.Next time I purchase a Kindle version of a classic novel, I will avoid Fictionwise Classic."
2,"Looks good, but...","This costume was so cute and looked wonderful, BUT the shiny blue on the skirt started wearing off instantly. A slight touch scraped off the blue to reveal a dusty gray color. I checked other of the same costume and all of them did the same thing. Good costume for a short time, one day only. Not something that will last."
5,Perfect fit,"I've had this sander a long time and the original pad basically dissolved, partly from using sticky-back sandpaper. This replacement fit perfectly."
1,Defective,"I ordered this album and the Kenny Rogers CD was fine, but Dolly Parton's sounded like chipmunks singing. Returned the set and they replaced it with another set. Once again, Dolly's CD was defective with same problem, obviously a problem when they made the cd's. Was really looking forward to having this CD, it is a shame."
4,A nice book to start with.,There are a lot of books out there on psychic abilities.For those who are just taking an interest I would suggest this book first.As you progress you can always find more indepth books.
3,Cute but falls apart,"This is the cutest little kitchen but, it becomes frustrating for my daughter because the oven door falls off ALL the [...] and the table also falls off. I bought it because of the Fisher Price name but, I'm a little disappointed."
3,Will it fit the PC 343?,"Almost, it's about a fraction of an mm off. Why does PC do that with different pads on various 5"" models? Doesn't make any sense, they all should be interchangeable. This is like Milwaukee batteries.In any case, enlarging the holes just a little will make it fit nicely on the 343. I notice the backing is a plastic plate on the replacement where the original was aluminum. Seems like if the pads needed to be replaced every few months, it doesn't matter. So couple of pad replacements is about the original cost of the PC unit. And for the cost of the pad alone you could buy the Harbor Freight 5"" ROS on sale and throw it away every year or so. Maybe I'll just have couple of HFs around as spares - cheap enough.When my original pad on the PC worn out I used hot glue as an emergency while the replacement was in transit. Hot glue seems to work ok, glue comes off nicely too when changing papers. Excellent sander, not so good pad."
3,Wears out relatively quickly,"I'm now on my third pad. Granted I use the sander frequently and it is over 6 years old. Bottom line the sander has exceeded my expectations and keeps on going (bit noisier now than new) but the velcro stops working on the pad requiring replacement. Good that PC offers a replacement. Hopefully they continue to do so as I noticed they updated the design of the 5"" H&L random orbit."
3,"Don't care for the ""fits all"" pad",Sticks well like all PC sanding pads. The one size fits all for both 5 and 8 hole versions doesn't pull the dust as well. Tends to make the paper want to tear through those large holes when sanding edges. Go for the either the 5 hole or the 8 hole version unless you really need to accommodate both. Did not return them but I wouldn't order them again.
5,Porter-Cable 13909 Replacement Pad (for Model 333VS-5 or 8-Hole Hook & Loop),It was a good choice purchase since it gives the ability to use either 5 or 8 hole sanding discs. wished this pad was advertised more instead of just finding it through internet sites.
3,Loved it!! ... but you might not,"I love this movie - I can't really say it's a 'good' movie but I bought it immediately after I saw it. I like Luke Wilson and Denise Richards although I can't say they are great actors. I usually avoid Ben Affleck movies just because I don't like most of them. Well, Ben wasn't in this one much. He did a fine job when he was. Luke and Denise were charming as usual.The sell for me was someone I'd never heard of although his face is familiar - Jay Lacopo, who wrote this and starred as the '3rd wheel'. He was great. He made the movie a success in my opinion. His quirky humor isn't the kind that had me laughing out loud, but it was fun and had me smiling throughout the movie."
1,Nv Peep toe- NOT the Envy of others,"I am Steven By Steve Madden's #1 Fan, for fit, comfort, quality and style but this shoe did not work at all !!! It was painful to the point that there was no earthly way I could walk in them unless my feet were dislocated. I had to return them. The fit ran very snug and tight. I was very dissapointed because I have LOVED all my Steven shoes from pumps, peeptoes and sandals and I loved the animal print, but I just had to return them."
3,It really got the third party started.,"I think it's quiet lovely with it's melody and rhythym. I enjoyed the remix. It had me dancing till dawn, and then again till dusk. The up beat rhythyms kept me going all night."
1,This page is a rip-off you can`t get any maps w/o pay!,"Looking for map directions and none of the maps on this page are accessible. Can`t you people give anything away? I mean what`s this word comming to when we have to pay, pay, & pay for everythhing even local directions. Dosn`t anybody do anything free anymore???? Disgusted in NY"
3,It's OK,Used this just to see where my weaknesses are but I can't say that I would use it for the state test. Maybe as a tool to helpt study but the state words their tests differently so I wouldn't recommend using just this to study for that.
3,Need a better picture and DVD damaged easily where I had to skip over parts. Note: I make it a point to take of my DVD's.,"Skipping over parts due to damage of DVD was a concern, Will there ever be a Part 3 for distribution in the future?"
1,Awful,Not a lot happens. Terry Brooks is just filling up space waiting for the third book. Pathetic.
3,disappointed,"This book is just for die hard fans of the Shannara series. Which I'm one of, but this is not Mr. Brooks best work. Something not rigth with the writting, Good storyline, fine characters,etc. It beats nothing."
1,Should Be Called eeew,"This album is unlistenable. The singer sounds like the kid behind you in math who always was whining to go to the bathroom. Called punk or glam by most critics, it will in fact remind you of the bad music from years past, avoid at all costs."
5,Shop around!,"Go to the orange or blue box store online (you know the ones) and type in the P-C part #, Amazon won't let me say anything about price or availability. My sander is as good as new. Excellent!"
2,There is a problem...,"Many here have reported a problem with the screws coming threw the pad making the pad useless when it can no longer be held to the sander. Well I know why. This replacement pad (made by Porter Cable) has a thinner backing plate. The screws therefore are too long to properly secure the pad to the sander. Although the user may not realize it, the pad then shifts around the screws as it is being used. That constant shifting slowly erodes the backing plate at the screw holes - Eventually the pad just falls off.So to make this pad last as long as the original pad, you need to either cut the screws down in length, purchase shorter screws, or find a washer that will fit. This way the pad will be properly secured to the sander and not ""jiggle."""
3,Bad design,"The sander is still in great shape, but I can't believe this pad is already worn out. I have the same problem as a lot of the reviewers. The screw holes wore through. I also can't believe that I am going to have to pay twenty bucks to fix a problem that I shouldn't be having this soon. The hook an loop part is still just fine. I am a cabinet maker, and I am used to the pads wearing out on the sanders at work, but never in this manner. I've had the hook and loop wear out which is expected. I've also had the hook and loop separate from the foam pad which happens at about the same time as the hook and loop wears out, so it is also no big deal. I wouldn't buy this sander if I had it to do over again."
5,working again,Thuis is the second time I have replaced the hook portion of this sander. easy installation and good as new again
5,The book you must read if you want to be healthy!,"I could not put this book down once I started reading it. I found this book easy to read. Tonya does a very good job of explaining how food affects us on the molecular level in laymen's terms. This book holds the answers to many health problems that people have. I am a nurse of 23 years (geriatric nursing is my speciality). I have seen what the Standard American Diet does to people over a span of time. The title and the cover caught my eye. Added note here, I recently met Tonya at a health food store in Memphis,TN. I must say that in my 23 years of nursing, I have never seen such glowing health in an adult such as Tonya! Her skin is smooth, so clear and so very transparent. There was no need for makeup. Her hair has a beautiful shine. Tonya practices what she preaches! She looked just like her picture on the cover of this book, only better in real life."
1,Avoid,"I'm an 80-year-old artist with a PhD in experimental psychology from Columbia University and certificates from a five year New York City postdoctoral program in psychotherapy and psychoanalysis. My grandmother was an artist. Her home was full of paintings by artists that she bought cheaply and are now worth millions. A great great uncle of mine was and still is a world famous writer and poet. This book was the biggest diappointment of all the books I've read so far. Alas, there was no review of it at Amazon to save me from ordering it. There's need for a competent book with a similar title. I hope this book means the world is closer to having a good one written."
3,Not engaging at all,"I haven't completely read the book, but by skimming through one or two chapters, the book looked very hard to read. The flow isn't set properly which makes it hard to read."
3,"Good Biographical Read, Weak Political History","Neale's book comes from an older world of historical writing, and would not satisy the demands of current historians. It tells the story of Elizabeth I as a loving tale of a personal friend, focusing on assessments (or presumptions!) about character. The book makes Elizabeth seem a strong and deserving leader. The book reveals little, though, of the details and especially the implications of political decision-making. A war, or a raising of taxes, is seen as meaningful only as a development in some relationship between Elizabeth and some other nobleman. This work would be of almost no help to someone trying to understand the developments in English politics in the 1500s. As a personal drama, though, (perhaps as a soap-opera), this is an engaging and informative read."
3,Soundtrack sucks...movie is good.,"I have both the original VHS version and the DVD version of this film.I have to agree with everyone who talks about the DVD soundtrack.It truly is a pity, I only bought the DVD so I wouldn't ruin the VHS.I got it for ten bucks at an FYE so it wasn't much of a loss.This cheesy ""go america""! 80's music truly insults the film, hearing it in the background actually makes the movie boring to me and takes away from the whole experience. You watch Fear and Loathing or the original WTBR with the proper soundtrack and it helps add to experience, which is why some people like myself find themselves watching F&L; over an over again because it's just that good.I truly believe that Hunter S. Thompson would shoot the idiot who cheaped out on this DVD. I'd like to."
3,no fear and loathing,"Where the Buffalow Roam is essentially the edited ... version of Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. Where as when I first saw it I expected many more simularities.If your looking for a ... laugh watch it, or if your at all informed or knowledgable of Dr. Thompsons work then you may enjoy.But if you expect an all consuming joy ride which ruins your mind the way Fear and Loathing does, get Easy Rider instead."
3,The Afterschool Special Version of HST,"I'm a journalist myself and a writer of many mediums, and I find the biggest weakness of this film is: the lame direction. On paper, the writing is good, but the whole thing looks and feels like the producers are trying to explain Hunter S. Thompson to your parents. It's the Afterschool Special version of Gonzo journalism and Hunter S. Thompson.Still, Bill Murray's performance is brilliant and worth seeing. He made a fantastic Hunter.Buy a version with the original soundtrack (I guess) if you're a fan of the exaggerated persona Hunter created. It's a fun way to live.-- Todd"
3,A good,"Dumb movie that captures the essence of Hunter S. Thompson but does nothing much else than that. Bill Murray's excelent performance carries the movie through it's episodic and disheveled structure and form. Peter Boyle is excelent in the few scenes he has, but he doesn't trully capture the real, Dr. Gonzo. It is to be watched by fans of Hunter S. Thompson, because only they could probably disseminate the unusual nature and the wild and over the top antics that blanket this film to almost being a feature length Three Stooges."
1,I Just Finished Watching The Newer DVD 02/01/05,"Just a 'heads-up"" for all the fans of the original soundtrack. This new DVD edition released today by Universal, has the same soundtrack as the Anchor Bay DVD release. This is really a pity and just goes to show you what a studio will do to make a quick buck. This year is the 25th anniversary of this movie and I would think that Universal would want to do this right, but this is not the case. Loud boo's and hisses for Universal Pictures!"
3,compare,Neede this for my Thompson collection for comparison.Murry does a fare job but movie hops around without much definition.Not nearly as good as fearand loathing
3,Average Bollywood romance,"This is about a playboy (Salman Khan) who finally falls in love. The girl (Twinkle Khanna) rejects him because of his wanton ways. He changes to prove his love. Then, unknown to her a boy turns up claiming to be his child from an old relationship. A DNA test proves this so. Playboy tries putting the child in others care and keeping him a secret but then bonds with him. Then he has a dilemma - if the beloved finds out she is likely to refuse to go ahead with their planned wedding. However he cant reject his son now either.This was a fine Bollywood romance: nothing stand but but fine to spend some time with. Both Salman and Twinkle are good, but so are the supports - Anupam Kher as playboy's grandpa, Johnny Lever as trusted servant, and also the boy.Elsewhere on the Net it tends to score average to a bit above."
4,A history of the human imagination,"I gotta say I have really enjoyed reading this book since purchasing it last week.The book is divided into several sections covering different incarnations of ""The Gentle Folk"" and classifying which branch live in the woods,under the earth,in your home,etc. One particular point of interest to me was a little letter written by the author within the book that really seems to evoke the spirit of the elves as you read it. Inviting them to return from the deep recesses of the imagination.The artwork has a certain appeal to it. I think for most people they'll either love it or hate it. I enjoy the fresh approach given,which tends to come off a little cartoony at times but always stay edgy enough from coming off retro.The bibliography is lengthy and will supply me with a plethera of further reading,though some are quiet old and may be a bit of a challenge to find."
2,These just don't work!,"These gloves don't remove that much hair, and they are hard to clean. Do I regret the purchase? No way! This $1.99 got me to free shipping, so it was well worth it."
4,Fantastic,This cd is amazing! I love every song on it and I love how poppy and dancy it is. It's the perfect music to listen to in your car or in the shower or just anywhere.The best songs on the album are Walk Me Home and We're So Loud.They're fun and so cute. The music just wants to make you smile.
5,Nia is incredible!,"fresh, smooth, refreshing, original style. very inspirational. skills up the ying! hip-hop, soul, and funk, gracefully mixed into one. it is simply fantastic. De(Blacka)licious! thanks nia! we're talking premium quality stuf. my commendations to nia. hip-hop needs you. thanks for being clean too. it really makes a difference. i'm feelin ya."
1,No Wonder the Machines are Angry,"Robots of the world, unite! Grab Ronnie and use his body to help build a Lexus! What went wrong? Better yet, what didn't go wrong? It makes for a shorter list."
1,Yuck,"If Ronnie never deserves at least four stars for any of his efforts, you know that is evidence of a serious problem. As was noted in many other reviews on many other albums, EVERY SINGLE NOTE is off-key. And when I say off-key, I don't mean as in slight distortion--I mean so off-key it sounds like Tracy G. smashed his guitar to splinters and left the strings intact.""Angry Machines"" has some serious personal problems. The lyrical arrangements completely lack any imagination whatsoever, and Ronnie sounds as if he just recovered from a bout with mumps. The thumping bass is very odd-sounding, belonging more on a tribute album to Studio 54 than a Dio album. The only aspect that allows this album to earn even one star is Vinnie's drums; he doesn't fool around with rhythm all that often (of course, neither did Bill Ward), but he knows exactly what the songs need. Despite his most valiant of efforts, nothing could save this album from becoming a quagmire of sludge."
4,Dio for the nineties...,"Like Black Sabbath's'Dehumanizer'(1992)-a great album,by the way-what got in the way of success for this 1996 release was the new direction that Ronnie took:a different theme for his lyrics,and a new guitar player,Tracy G.-very different in style and musical outlook than Dio's previous legionnaires,especially in his inclination toward more extreme and less melodic forms of metal,e.g.Fear Factory's machine gun riffs come to mind.Once again,the problem here is not with the artists,but rather with the expectations of the fans.A very solid and interesting effort,proving that Ronnie can go beyond the dragon-rock approach."
4,Very Credible Biography,"Pandit Rajmani Tigunait writes about Swami Rama's life. He has firsthand knowledge as well as input from others who knew the Swami well. From my reading of Swami Rama's book (Living with Masters of the Himalaya)it appears that Swami Rama has mastered many of the yogic techniques he practiced as a youth. With his mind and the powers of concentration he is able to heal the sick, predict the future, and defy physical laws. Compare these events with what Jesus did in the Bible. Since I have practiced Kriya Yoga for years, I found this book perfectly understandable and believable. It only emphasizes that most folks are the living dead; they have yet to come alive."
5,Simply the Best Sander Out there!,"This is the best 1/2 sheet sander available! Smooth running, long lasting, quiet."
4,Glue board,"I bought a pack of these when I got the Fly Web Fly trap, it only comes with 1 board. The trap works pretty well, I put a video review up for it.."
5,"great,great,great,absolutely GREAT!!!","this book is one of the best about Leonardo DiCaprio. it has the most acurate info about him i've ever found. many pictures, lots of quotes and a lot of info you won't find anywere else...!!! my sugestion is: READ IT!"
4,good deal,This book was used but in great shape. It came quickly and well packaged. A really good purchase. Thanks!
4,It took me awhile to realize it's not an energy drink,"I bought a multipack of all the Nutrisodas from beveragesdirect, and i thought for the longest time that all the nutrisodas had energy stuff in it. in fact, only the ""energy"" nutrisoda was ""energetic"".I can't say much about how good this was for my joints, but this is my favorite flavor out of the bunch (and i've had the chance to sample all the nutrisoda flavors). it's like a sparkling apple drink with a midtone of cherry. and anyone can make good use of the ingredients they added for joints in this stress-filled world!"
4,Une disque superbe,"Cet album est complet de chansons variées et intérésantes, chacune avec son propre attrait distinct. C'est encroyable l'écouter quand on est envie d'un peu de calme. La disque est très jolie ! C'est dommage qu'elle n'inlcue pas le vidéo de Sacré Fraais ; j'ai acheté l'album seulement à cause de cette chanson-là. Ce dit, la haute qualité du restant de la disque m'a plu beaucoup. J'aimerais si la parole était un peu plus en franais au lieu d'tre presque tout en anglais, mais que peut-on faire ? Achetez cette disque si vous voulez de la musique calme mais joyeuse; elle n'est pas pleine de chansons techno-dance énérgétiques. J'espère que d'autres reconnatront le talent de Dimitri ; cet album est très haute !"
3,MadeMan1,"The game was OK. It was another mafia clone game in the tradition of the Godfather, but I think the game could have done away with Vietnam. Makes the game less mafiaso."
5,Finally and I have pre-ordered Season 2!,"This is so exciting only 4 days to go and I can finally watch Season 1 in it's entirerity. No commercials no late night logos stuck across the season. I can't wait to to watch this Julia, this Suzanne, this Mary-Jo and this Charlene."
4,Love the product-not the packaging,"This was a Christmas gift for my husband and it came in a big box with a picture of the dartboard on the side. So much for surprises. Other than that, we love the board."
5,GREAT BOARD KEEPS GAME INTERESTING,THIS IS THE BOARD. !!!!! Have not had a glitch yet. Throw 2-3 times a week with several friends and it works flawlessly. Most unregistered hits are the fault of light throwers and lobbers....................
1,Product not new!,"Cannot rate the dart board itself. Dart board was obviously returned by a prior Amazon customer, poorly repackaged and shipped to me as ""new"" merchandise. Lower corner of dart board was broken off and accessories were not packaged but just pitched in the box. Don't understand why Amazon would have wasted their time and money shipping this out to me. Evidently good help is still hard to find despite such a high unemployment rates. I guess we won't have that new dart board for our party next weekend."
5,A Masterpeice,This is a CD that is magical and timeless. This recording will transport you into another world. The musicianship and the recording are both impeccable and you don't have to be a fan of middle eastern music to be moved by this extraorinary recording.
4,Great work by Omar Faruk/Brian Keane!!!,"A friend gave me this album to listen to as I told him that I like Sufi music. I half-expected religious chants etc., but I was pleasantly surprised when I started listening to all the tracks. Initially, it didn't sound very emotionally appealing but after a few listens, I just got hooked onto this album. I love the following tracks - Imaginary Traveller, Nighttime, Sweet Trouble, Siseler, and the title track. I especially love Nighttime and Sweet Trouble for their soothing melody (I go crazy listening to the mandolin-type instrument bit in both songs). Overall, a very remarkable effort by both artists. I would strongly recommend this to anyone who has an ear for world music."
1,deck no deck,I didn't read all the info provided and only viewed the primary description indicating this purchase included a deck. The purchase did not provide a deck of cards. My fault but I still feel cheated.
2,Disappointing,This was not as good as I thought it would be. Certainly not worth the price tag. Would not recommend.
2,Of Little Substance,"I bought this book thinking that the author would go through some cases, explaining how she does psychotherapy. Not exactly. This book is more of a survey of psychotherapy--basically telling you everything you pretty much already know about it. What's even more frustrating is that not only is it a waste of a book, it's a waste of money. Very frustrating. (I'm surprised too because everyone else gave it such high reviews....I'm not sure what they were smoking...)"
5,Hot action flick in the streets of NYC,"Fight scenes are hot, these two fat guys are karate kicking, man I have never seen anything like this before. The Story is alright, but the gunfights are hot. The ending is brutal and heartless, but unexpected. The sound track is blazin just like the movie, it got some stuff from Beatnuts. There was a white kid in the movie he kinda wack, aside from that the fights where kinda phat. Fat Joe, Cuban link and Angie Martinez they where in the movie but not as much as I had hoped, Angie kinda hot in the movie rocking some tight leather gear. Got to get the DVD got some cool behind the scene stuff."
4,the girl who ran away,Loved the book. I first read it in 6th grade. This young girl creates a fairyland in her meadow. She lives very close to nature.
2,Go for the Hatcher/Loughran book instead,"I love most of the O'Reilly books I have, but occasionally there's a dud, and this is one of them. It didn't tell me anything I didn't know from reading the Ant documentation. And it's already out of date, since it covers 1.4.1 rather than 1.5.Try the Manning book, ""Java Development with Ant"", by Steve Loughran and Erik Hatcher. It's better in every respect."
5,The title is just the beginning.,"Maybe you can't judge a book by its cover, but this book has a great cover and a title that introduces Kevin Dole 2's unique word play.The book was at times: weird; laugh out loud funny; thought provoking. But, what I loved most about it is the way Kevin Dole 2 played with language throughout the course of the book.A very fun read."
5,Great!,Our 2 1/2 year old (who is tall) is using it right now and it's a great size for her. I can see her using it up to 4 years if need be. I would recommend this swing for ages 1 to 4 yrs old. It is very secure and has a strap for younger kids.
3,some good fights,It's hard to get legal hockey fight tapes so I enjoy watching the fights on this one. Quality is like most of them. Watchable and not that expensive.I heard about it on a good site http://www.hockeyfighters.8m.com
3,some good fights,It's hard to get legal hockey fight tapes so I enjoy watching the fights on this one. Quality is like most of them. Watchable and not that expensive.
5,The Basis of Childhood Fantasy,"When I was about 5 or 6 my mom picked this book up for me. It was the basis of my childhood fantasies. I am now 17 and I was led back to this book through the guidence of the faeries themselves. Dont think I'm crazy. This book was the beginning of the most beautiful journey I have taken and the journey I continue to take. Stay true to light, and stay true to love. Peace out! Love, Tamara"
1,"Sorry, Bud.",Tried this out as a Bud Cort fan . . . and wish I hadn't. Wouldn't recommend wasting the time with this one. Very slow and rather creepy unless you like stalkers.
5,Love city of heroes,great price fast shipping for a great game what more can a person say ..i use these cards for city of heroes and its such a great deal
4,Awesome game,This game was really ahead of it's time. It is hard to make run on a modern PC but is worth it as it still has plenty of story and suspense even after all these years !
2,"Kindle errors... Really, people","Wonderful, fabulous stories. Willis never disappoints. I wish the same could be said of the Kindle store version of this otherwise amazing collection: the amount of typos and errors are beyond belief. Makes for an extremely distracting read... The works of this talented author deserve better. I'm very disappointed an Amazon for this sloppy work.-------------Update: The situation was made worse by the idiotic response email that came from Amazon in response to my complaint - which made it clear that the customer ""service"" representative didn't actually read my email. Just adds insult to injury. Thanks so much."
4,Not her strongest collection,"Not that anything she writes could be bad, but this collection never appealed to me quite as much as Impossible Things. I do adore Blued Moon, and personally think it's worth it just for that. In addition, it's got a time traveler's story (from the same universe as Doomsday Book and To Say Nothing of the Dog). But it doesn't have as many amazing stories as Impossible Things, so it's only getting 4 stars."
4,For Academic Coursework,"Enjoyable read for academic pursuit. There are some unsupported statements throughout the book. Most the material, however, is factual, with applicable references. Information is presented primarily from a historical context, with little emphasis on future policy-making. Thirteenth edition does discuss recent changes in federal policy and structure, i.e. chapters on Homeland Security, and Defense Policy."
2,Doesn't work well for me.,I am very disappointed with this sander. I thought it would work great for sanding large table tops. Instead I have found that a large belt sander (4x24) followed by a finishing sander does a much better and quicker job. I have the Porter Cable 4x24 sander and the Porter Cable 330 finishing sander.
2,Not a daily use sander,"This sander is great in the beginning. It works like a well built machine, and then, it happens. For some reason, this thing gets out of balance and ceases to do a good job. It wobbles all over the place. My shop owns 6 of these that were all bought at the same time, now after one year of daily use, 4 of them are unusable because of the counter-balance.PROS** Can apply alot of pressure** Very strongCONS** Gets out of balance** Brushes hard to change** 2 hand sander"
1,can i give it 0 stars?,"Absolutely horrible, if you enjoyed the first one DO NOT waste your time on this sequel. Once again, ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE"
1,valses para quince anos,"im not recive ma order yaet i well never buy notin on you compani again you compani charchmy the money from my crdit card and i ""NEVER"" recive my cd ."
5,Beautiful,relaxing and harmonic oriental music.would touch your soul and would take you far a way...
3,Fluffy Fun,"The Free Fellows league is a great fun beach book series. Like some of the better fluffy-romance genre, there's a sub-plot of intrigue and protecting the woman's honor in addition to two people falling in love. However...this is might be the weakest of the series."
1,Please read carefully,"I should have read the description better, it does NOT come with CD's. Plus, it's far too involved. Good perhaps if moving there but overkill for travelling."
5,Good Quality,Bought this book at an unbeatable price. It came fast and in great quality. I would recommend buying from this sender.
5,Deceptively simple truths,"I bought the book because it promised no 'quick-fixes'. I wanted something worth thinking about and this book gave me just that. Profound and emotional truths. I always felt a presence of my extended family in my relationships and so the concept of the constellations intrigued me. Having never done one, I am still a bit skeptical. However, the book is not just that. Bert Gellinger has an unbelievably accurate insight into relationships. I found myself reading his deceptively simple truths and a little light would go on because the concepts seem to verbalize ideas I've known to be true, but never articulated. These concepts alone make the book invaluable.Additionally, it's a quick read - it's not bogged down with psycho babble. It's direct and thought provoking."
3,Just your basic Bosch-style relay,"There's not a lot to say about this one. If you know what it is then you should know how it's used. I keep several on hand, I always seem to be adding lights to my vehicles. Buy the plug for it insead of using individual terminals for a much cleaner install and no hassle reconnecting it when you have to replace one.Instead of wiring it as the diagram shows you, consider connecting the switch lead to 12+ and putting your switch on the ground terminal. Done that way you only have one wire to run to the dash and it's a ground, not hot. Connect the other side of your switch to any convenient ground. Much safer and simpler."
3,Adventures along the Fort Steele Trail,"This is a book that anyone interested in Western Montana or early western history will want. It is the history of a trail that began as an Indian trail from Frenchtown near Missoula, Montana, and worked its way through several habitats to Fort Steele, British Columbia. Today, Highway 93 roughly parallels the old trail in the Montana, connecting Missoula, St. Ignatius, Polson, Kalispell, and Eureka. As people of European origin moved into the area, the trail evolved section by section from a horse trail, to a wagon road, to a highway. This book is a well researched history of the trail, and also provides information about the characters and communities associated with the trail. The writing and publishing quality is what one would expect of a local effort. It is quite readable and made an excellent gift this past Christmas to some of my Montana friends."
4,Strange...,"I felt it was strange why ""Reach Out & Touch"" was left out from the other release of Diana Ross' The Best Of...Love & Life (2CD).""Reach Out & Touch (Somebody's hand)"" has been an anthem for Miss Ross for years.This collection covers some of her best recordings but many more are left out. I still don't understand why the label included ""Touch by Touch"" & ""Eaten Alive"" ?? Where is ""Touch Me In The Morning""?Anyway, I would still recommend the other double CD titled ""Love & Life. The Very Best Of Diana Ross""."
4,500 Hats bought on Amazon.com,"The book arrived sooner than expected which was wonderful since it is a Christmas gift. It was packaged in a flimsy cardboard envelope but arrived in good shape without any bends or creases. The only thing that displeased me was a faint, almost unnoticeable except in the right light, scratches on the cover like the book had gotten them on some sort of conveyor belt. Overall I'm fairly happy with the book and the delivery."
5,I cannot stand this book!,I LOVE Dr. Suess. Really. We have lots of his books and I enjoy reading all of them to my kids with the exception of this one. It annoys me to no end. That's just it...it seems like there is no end. It's not rhymie or sing-songy like his others. It's just repetitive and boring and ..... oh just YUCK!
3,Truly a Chi-Lites Fan,"Although this album contains some of the gems, the ""Too Good To Be Forgotten"" box set would be a better deal. A lot of the songs that had the Chi-Lites 'out there' are missing on this album (ex: Toby). Not bad, but, I know there's something better."
4,Good for advanced estimating,This is a very good book for advanced estimators.If you are trying to get into estimating go with Means.If you want to accurately calculate time to construct a major piping project this will cover you very well.
1,Watch for wrist injury with this tool!,"I have had one of these for quite some time, having acquired it during my apprenticeship in custom furniture shop. I love its power and speed of finishing, finding it quite capable of putting a flawless surface on glued panels.However, I used this tool to the point of acquiring tendon damage in my wrists. Following multiple cortisone injections in both wrists (boy, that hurts!), I had to have surgery on my right wrist to repair the damage. I took my tools to my physical therapist, and she declared it the culprit. My mentor borrowed it for 6 months, and had to return it because of the wrist pain.The barrel design of the body causes an unnatural strain on the wrists. Its a powerful tool, but minimize the operating time.Take if from someone who knows wood, tools, and pain."
4,Sizzle,"With my wedding day approaching I found myself caught up in all those last minute details and I did not make itto the department store to grab my chosen ""Beautiful""-- but I discovered this fragrance and liked it. I married in December so this musky scent was fine in the freezing temperatures. Now when I wear this scent- my husband and I are instantly reminded of our special day and the honeymoon after. I will only wear a little and only in cold weather- would be overpowering if worn in warmer weather or in large amounts."
3,Missing Big Picture,"If you need a book that explains the technology, then buy this book.If you need a reference guide, then buy this book.If you need some examples that illustrate the power and limitations of this technology, then you should *definitely* buy this book.If you are looking for the big picture, concerning the big freaking aspect-oriented programming thing, if you want to read about scientific justification, and if you're looking for proof, then you *might* consider buying this book, but I didn't find it very valuable from that perspective.If you just want to be entertained, then you might consider buying something else. Maybe something like 'The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay'."
4,"great series, bad extras","fans of this series have been waiting for years for this release. after several attempted releases, it's finally out in canada and soon in the states. the release includes all 13 episodes of the series with remastered picture and sound, but falls way short in the extras department. disk one has all 6 episodes of the first series and the first episode of the second, with commentary on two episodes by don mckellar. the second disk rounds off the the rest of the episodes with no commentary at all, a photo gallery and some cast and crew bios. the disks are well worth the wait, but it would have been nice to have more in the way of special features. if you can't wait until the u.s. release of twitch city, you can get it through amazon.ca right now."
1,ok well not this time,Trying to hard and not hitting the mark - don't like this one at all. Hello Returns dept?
5,FANTASTIC HIGHS & KICK -ASS BASS!!!,"THESE HEADPHONES ARE ONE OF THE BEST I'VE HEARD AT ANY PRICE. HIGHS ARE SMOOTH AND BRIGHT, BUT NOT HARSH AND BASS IS LOW AND CLEAN. THEY FIT LIKE A GLOVE AND ARE VERY COMFORTABLE EVEN AFTER WEARING FOR HOURS AT A TIME. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THESE HEADPHONES FOR GREAT SOUND AND PORTABILITY."
2,Not reliable,"The first ones I owned, the flimsy cord broke. The second ones I bought lasted awhile, but then they broke in half. The third ones I owned they had bad no sound on the left side. The were comfortable, and I liked the second pair because it had awesome sound quality. Though, the durability of these are a big problem, which means I will not be buying them again."
3,Just so-so :|,"I really didnt like some parts of this book. I will say this, Mrs. Gideon creates vivid characters that you WILL detest, and care about. I did like the ending and the plot was pretty good as well. I just hate to know one of the characters is innocent and having the ""good guys"", or girl in this case, believe them guilty. It does fall in line with the plot, I just dont care for those types of stories. All in all the book was ok."
4,It is a nicely made equipment bag,"Nice long bag for drum rack components or even your stands if you leave them up. The larger bag (13xs50) has no zippered compartment for, I guess, a throne. I can only assume that the smaller bag has this compartment. So the picture here (as of this date) is the smaller bag or at least not the bag I got."
3,decent bag,"I really like the bag. But the first time I used it the zipper tore a little right in the middle. The bag works great though for stands. You can put them in without breaking them down, because of how long it is. Disappointed about the zipper but didn't want to have to take the time to ship it back, and wait for a new one. Hopefully it won't get worse."
5,Best GIMP reference book ever!,"Brilliantly written to appeal to all levels of GIMP users -- beginners, intermediate, and advanced (even for people who want to write their own scripts for the GIMP!).Full-color photos throughout illustrate everything, from the beginners' how-to's, to the projects of increasing difficulty, taking you step-by-step from being a newbie to becoming a master of the program. Best of all, it's the most up-to-date book on the GIMP available, including information on v.2.4!I've been so frustrated, trying to learn the GIMP on my own, because I knew it was a program with so much potential, but I simply didn't have the knowledge to tap all that potential. Now I do, and what I've learned from this book even helps me work with other imaging programs.If you want to learn the GIMP, you need this book!"
2,Not worth the price.,"I bought this toy for my son for his sixth birthday. He loves it but for the money it costs I was a little disappointed. It is not very fast, thank goodness it came with training wheels because I don't know how a kid would be able to ride it without, it just doesn't go fast enough. He has had it for a little over a week and the stickers are already peeling off. If he didn't love it so much I would send it back. It cost too much to just be ok."
4,Good Toy but may be not for a 3Y old,I bought this for my 3Y old son. It is well built and has 2 speeds. The battery holds the charge well. Actually my 5Y old daughter is enjoying it more than her brother (and that is why the title is). I would recommend this toy.
1,too many defects,"I'll be returning this software back to the store. It seems that it is not fully tested - it generates SQL errors, and shows the actual SQL. (thanks - it is very ""helpful""). The support is not free. Very disappointed."
1,AWFUL PROGRAM DO NOT BUY,"I bought this because it was only $30 and WAY cheaper than Quickbooks Pro. However, after only 5 minutes of trying to use it, I realized that I can ONLY pay my payables by cutting a CHECK! I pay most of my bills using my credit card and debit card! (Who pays by check anymore?)This program is CHEAP and CRAP and if you want to call their tech support, they charge you $20 just for the CALL and additional $ for each minute.DO NOT BUY THIS PROGRAM DO NOT BUY THIS PROGRAM -- Spare yourself the agony and get Quickbooks Pro. Even the grafix (and desktop icon included!) are awful. POOR POOR POOR"
3,"RHODA FANS, NOT SO FAST...","If this distributor does what the distributor of THE MARY TYLER MOORE SHOW did, then we will all be in trouble. With MARY, they released Seasons 1-4, THEN released the ENTIRE SERIES. And not the remaining seasons individually. This means we die-hard fans will have to buy the first 4 seasons AGAIN just to own the rest of the series! Although I LOVE RHODA, I hate being taken advantage of by these distributors. Please keep the individual seasons coming!!! And release PHYLLIS too!!"
5,This show is terrfic!,This show is terrfic. At first when I read the reviews I wasn't sure to get it or not because of the reviews but I am so glad I didn't listen to them. This show is awesome. The whole issue of the quality of the dvds is highly overrated. It is not as bad as some people made it out to be. So don't worry and get Rhoda Season 1. I cannot wait for Season 2 to come out. I watched the first season so fast. I love the show and I am only in my mid 20's. Shows you great of a show this is. The problem is I wish Season 2 would come out sooner.
3,The show is great; the DVD quality is horrible,I love Rhoda. The show is fantastic. But this has got to be the worst looking DVD I've ever seen. It looks like a VHS recording off of Nick at Nite transferred directly to DVD. The distributors (Fox or Shout or both) should really be ashamed for putting this classic show out in such a shoddy presentation. I hope they do better with season 2-5.
5,Invigorating dip in the Ocean,"I love using shower gels and body washes in the shower in stead of soap for their fragrant lovely non drying consistency. This shower gel by Solstis is really unique; it smells like no other cosmetic I have ever used. Sure many items will try and smell like an ocean, with the wet green blue artificial scent, yet they do not compare to this one.This wash smells like the salty ocean water, sunscreen lotion, sun, sand and a slight layer of milky fruit. It's really radiant and silky on and has the most incredible fresh scent; it makes me feel as if I have entered a paradise island and Im watching the sunset settling in misty colored sweet clouds as waves crash at my feet as I have never used a product that smelled this unique. At first this will smell faint, but using this with scrubby gloves or those bath poofs will yield luxe foam and a burst of some peaceful mineral rich island."
4,not bad,"when i heard about this movie i was very exited, i mean too many movies are about great whites (not like i didn't enjoy JAWS 5 stars!). but this one was about a bull shark. it only disapointed me a little. the shark looks pretty real by the plot is bad with the whole criminal, hostage situation deal. but then you add the terror sharks bring to peoples heart. if you thought the river was sfe, think again!"
5,"Great, easy to use product!","I've used screen printing products on and off for quite a few years now on various projects. Because my projects varied, I was never able to nail down a good exposure time. This product made exposure easy. It changes color as it hardens so all you have to do is keep an eye on it, and when the exposed area turns blue - You're done! So easy."
4,works well,"Make sure to follow directions. I tried using a reflector for the light and it over-exposed but the pie-pan setup worked perfectly.Anyone know how long this stuff lasts? It says a few weeks but I put the batch away about 18 month ago so I guess I will be seeing how it does. I only did a few screens from the container so if you don't think you will be doing many screens in one go, you may want to mix a smaller batch.Note that I do not use the cleaner. Following a recommendation from a friend, I pressure wash the screens and the emulsion comes right out. This was especially helpful with the over-exposed screen as the emulsion had baked in. I suspect this reduces the life of the screens but I think the math makes it worth it."
2,this may work good or bad depending on your house,"Very thick very old paint will gum up the disks. My house is 100yr old. I had to torch the paint off then use the tool. I kept a wire wheel on a angle grinder to de clog the disk.The tool will not remove pain from the lip of the clap boards, nor the last 3 in of the board. It also can't get the lowest board in some situations.What do you do about nail heads? You can't go pounding them all in on 3"" clap board or you will split it. I did one side of my house one year and the second the next. All the nail heads rusted on the first side through primber and two coats of quality latex paint. On the second side I painted all the heads with derect to metal paint. This worked, but it took a long time.I'd like to try the ""pro paint scraper"" it looks like it might work better.Don't put up plastic siding."
2,Bad service,I ordered what was supposed to be a mountain ambition poster but instead I was sent a shark poster two weeks after I was supposed to receive it. The service was bad and I didn't even get what I asked for.
3,"Okay, but a couple of issues.","I found it nearly impossible to have 3 full-sized acoustic guitars on this stand without them bumping into one another. It's also risky to leave the guitars on the stand without the rubber clamps in place. Because of the delicate balance, it's too easy to knock a guitar off of the stand."
2,basic,"With a basic ""be here now"" attitude, Mr. Allegretti manages to write 182 pages of no information. Platitudes abound such as ""find the good"" and ""think small"" and ""cultivate opportunities"" but it all boils down to finding joy and meaning in what you already do. I suppose this book would be good for overactive compulsive workaholics, but for me, it proved to only parrot what has been said over and over during the last 20 years."
4,handy router,"we use these routers in our workshop making country funiture . they are a big part of our operation, and so far have held up well under our work load . works great,for us, but you be the judge for you."
5,Porter-Cable 7310 5.6 Amp 3/4 HP Laminate Router,"t worked well for my formica trimming. I only had one countertop project, so didn't have a chance to use it for a long time. It held up for the job, and is still working well."
2,Nice tool but too much slop in the spindle for what I'm using it for.,It's a nice little tool and it would probably work fine timming laminates. But my use is to machine circuit boards and it had too much play in the spindle for the kind of work I needed to do.
1,Motor burned out,With only light use (putting a small grove detail on drawer fronts) the motor burned out in only a few weeks. Lacked speed control. Dust bag captured almost nothing.
1,Nopers,"Not a good book at all. If you want to read a real satirical writer, try Vonnegut or Swift or Twain."
4,Nobody does it better,"I have read Supreme Courtship, No Way to Treat a First Lady, Boomsday and now Florence, and I loved every one of them whether I agreed with the profile of the person or concept being pilloried or not. I do think it helps to be a news junkie to be a Buckley fan, so you can get the inside as well as the outside jokes, and he's a master of weaving those both together. Buckley has his father's gift of language but is fun, makes you think and shake your head, makes you wish some of these situations could happen, and makes you wonder how he even thinks this stuff up, and in this case, how he gets away with it! Please keep it up Mr. Buckley, we need these types of entertaining and edifying diversions!"
4,4 1/2 stars,"I've always liked Christopher Buckley's books and this one is no exception. One of the main themes of the book is the Mideast's treatment of there women. The story mixes both satire and suspense while writing about a subject that can raise numerous sensibilities.Buckley's done a fine job with this intelligent satire. The characters, as well as the originality, made this book well worth the time.Highly recommended."
3,"OK for what it is, but seriously flawed by current standards","The main flaw with this light would have been trivial in the recent past. Compared to other ways of providing light, even DeWalt ways, this is not an effective solution.I bought this to have a working light that also used the 18v power packs from my various DeWalt 18v tools. So far so good. But it really burns some power, it gets quite warm and the light doesn't last as long and isn't as bright as you would hope.I also have the DeWalt DC527 fluorescent light, it provides a much better working light, lasts longer and is easier to use to get light on your work. By comparison to the DC527 this is an uneven and yellowish light.This is more compact than the DC527 though, and it provides better range, fluorescent provides more white light, but only at limited range."
1,Swivel head broke,Swivel head broke when it fell about 3 feet off the floor. A construction light should be built to withstand some abuse. The area that secures the swivel head to the body is VERY thin and could be made stronger. Nice light but don't expect it to live through much abuse.
1,poor neck traction,"hard t put together and i had more traction on my chin, mouth and teeth then my neck. not happy with it."
2,Not for everyone,"After reading the reviews on this I thought this device was probably a good bet and worth trying. The set up was easy, although the device seems a bit cumbersome. However, possibly due to the shape of my head the harness hurts my jaw and I could not tolerate it."
2,Hole in water bag,"It arrived with a ""L"" shaped tear in the water bag. Unable to contact company to get a replacement"
3,Difficult Fit,"Item works as described, but I feel that the head gear could use some sort of netting to fit the head better with less discomfort on my chin."
1,Not to beat a dead horse but..............,"As the previous reviews have stated, this DVD it pointless. It sort of reminded me of those boring high school conversations about which album is better and who's a better guitarist. You like what you like and you don't need critics telling you what is better. I think Burn is a great album from beginning to end (well, maybe except for the instrumental) but that's my opinion. I was really hoping for some insight into how they recorded the album and a review of the creative process. After watching this DVD, I'm still hoping. Don't waste your money. However, if you are still interested, buy it from me ;-)"
3,Just Ok,"I bought this as a model to sit on a shelf and so my expectations were basically ""as long as it looks good that's all I care about"". It does look cool but the sliding door on one side is bent or something because it won't stay closed and it sits crooked like it's going to fall off at any time. Also, there were small areas where the paint had chipped off, which I noticed before even removing it from the package. Since it's just a model I will probably glue the door shut or something, but I was disappointed in the condition. I would never buy this as an actual toy for a kid to play with."
5,CONFIDENCE,An outstanding read and actionable guide on the use of CONFIDENCE by leaders in Sports and business to develop high performing teams. I used this book as the basis of a National Sales Meeting for a consumer packaged goods company. Ms Kanter uses her Fortune 500 contacts to provide insights into winning teams and organizations. She then ably draws similiarities to help any junior or senior executive become a better leader.A must for any business library
2,Ho-Hum,"This author is a little bit self-absorbed. I appreciated the sports and business case-studies, but there are so many more wonderful examples of her subject matter out there. This book got monotonous real quick."
3,Not that bad but not great either,"I originally bought this CD when I heard the track ""Something For The Soul"" featured on John Digweed's Global Underground: Hong Kong. Despite the fact that this CD was done in the 90's, it has it's moments of goodness. I'd say tracks 1-8 are the best and the remained of the tracks are eh. I bought the CD solely for the forenamed track and it was worth the like $7 I paid."
3,Doesn't seem worth the money,"I bought it as a gift for Christmas because it was on the list my sister gave me. She was very happy to get it, but seemed disappointed that it was only one disc with 6 episodes. I was stunned to open it when it arrived to see that I had paid $25 for one disc. But if someone really wants it, I guess what else are you going to do? As a gift, I probably would have opted for a gift that gave a little more for my money."
4,Great teaching aid for kids,"This book is effectively an ABC for kids. Published in the 1960s it still provides a valuable teaching aid to get young children learning their alphabet. Each letter has anassociated series of words and story attached to it. With characters such as ""Aaron"" the alligator, and Abigail a girl, simple sentences are conveyed with quirky illustrations to help children learn various concepts. From ""Abigail crosses the road"" to ""Aunt Ada likes Lions"" the book leads the young reader from A through to Z where we learn that ""Zero is very cold for zebras"". A fun way for any child to learn to read."
3,Experiments,"This doesn't fully make up for DAF's sound as it is a bunch of small cuts pasted together in the manner of the early Faust albums, only deploying a compact version of the noisy arrangements heard in the second side of ""Die Kleinen und die Bösen"". Nonetheless, the brusqueness and the minimal length of the tracks keep the listener thrilled from beginning to end."
3,Porter Cable Installers kit,"A nice tool which includes most everything you would want with a small router package like this. I use the offset base most, and the collet is easy to use and bits adjust easily for height. The only problem I have is that the bit chatters when used with the offset base. It has some play in it that is not a problem when using a flush trimmer bit with a bearing, but when other bits are inserted they don't cut smoothly. The other bases work very well though."
5,perfect,These worked perfect in my hitachi 12v EB1214S flashlight that came with my battery powered drill. Good value and havent had problems yet.
4,no travelling case for pixter color,"how frustrating to find that there is NO travelling case for the pixter color. Did FP think that they wouldn't sell ? Such a relatively expensive, sensitive, in the hands of children-toy and not to offer a simple case. OH well - big companies continue to amaze us with their creativity and lack of it at the same time."
1,Not impressed.,"I bought this vacuum based on the Electrolux reputation (we have a 55-year-old Electrolux at the cabin that still works!), and I am very disappointed. I had heard that Kirby vacuums go through belts like crazy but rarely would you ever change one on an Electrolux. The Kirby I've had for 5 years is using the original belt. I've gone through 2 belts on this Electrolux in a couple of months! I wish I could return it."
2,This vacuum blows..,"I purchased this vacuum about 5 mos. ago and I so hate it. It seems to have weekly ""issues"" where the ""bag full"" light will come on causing the vacuum to stop. Of course, the bag never actually gets full because the suction is not great. Cheaper vac's have done a much better job. I regret spending the money on this."
2,AWFUL Vacuum!,"This vacuum is fair for carpeting. It's VERY poor for flooring. We have owned it for 3 months and the carpet power head is already broken. The suction is fair. We are VERY disappointed with the quality of this vacuum for its very expensive price! I grew up with an Electrolux in the 1970's and that thing was an animal! My mother had that vacuum for almost 20 years without a hitch! We're going back to the Eureka Mighty Mite (which is under $100.00). The old Eureka we had did a MUCH better job being that we have 2 dogs and 5 cats. Crazy? Yes, but we love our animal companions! :)"
5,Awesome *****,"What can I say, Michael J. Fox,is AWESOME! I love this show and can't wait to get the next season!"
4,excellent tool have 2 !,"This is one of the finest laminate trimmers I have used after fifteen years in the fine woodworking business. Easy one-handed operation, powerful and compact motor, and absolutely the finest adjustable base on the market is why I keep reaching for this tool and why I own two of them. Like all carpenters before me, the lure of saving a few bucks on a lesser-quality tool was something I entertained. Luckily, among our crew I was able to test-drive several brands and models (mostly DeWalt and P.C. 7310). The second I picked up this model, I was hooked. Using a well-crafted instrument is its own reward. I am happy I spent the extra money every time I reach for this gem. So why not five stars? Because the base aperture is small which makes the starting and ending points of the cut hard to see. I made clear bases for my other routers out of plexiglass and will eventually get around to doing the same for these which will eliminate my only complaint."
5,Too Good to be gone from the market!!,"This router/ trimmer has been taken off the market, and replaced. These are the handiest routers for a number of jobs, and I really hate to see them go. Built sturdy and with plenty of power, they will be very hard to replace!!"
2,Not Omar Faruk Tekbilek's best work,"Unlike the brilliant ""Beyond the Sky"", ""Firedance"", or ""Mystical Garden"" which are undeniably great works of art with great compositions, playing, and a great production sound, this CD meanders around with occasionally inspired improvisation, but no real focus or finesse. If you already own all of Tekbilek's good CD's ( including ""Whirling"" and ""Crescent Moon"" ),and want to collect everything he has done, then check this out, otherwise, save your money and buy one of the other CDs I've just mentioned. You won't be sorry."
2,2.5 stars!,"Night Crossing follows a woman who finds herself in the middle of a terrorist attack in Ireland. The story is fairly interesting, but the writing in my opinion is not that great. The story line sounds interesting, but the way Snyder writes seems to cut down on the action. I would not really recommend this book."
2,Perhaps it's yellow because it's a lemon,"I would have given this product 4 or 5 stars until I read a certain review on this site. I was very happy with the performance of my DW904 12-Volt until it went dead on me a week ago. Just as this reviewer I speak of said, ""Oh I'll just replace the bulb"", but that didn't do it. Thinking that maybe the switch went bad I took the light apart and bypassed the switch but still no light. I promptly threw it in the trash in disgust because I really hadn't used it that much and I NEVER abused it. Even so I planned on buying another DW904 thinking that mine must have had a defect, but now after reading that another person has had the same problem with his, forget it. I'll probably order a Milwaukee flashlight for I had recently purchased their cordless 14.4 to replace the noisy 12 volt Dewalt I have. (The one that the flashlight came with)"
4,Jeffrey Archer - one of my favorite authors!,One of his best - outstanding story that moves along making it rather difficult to put it down! Highly recommended!
3,Not up to usual standard,"Could almost guess the plot, though his writing in previous books keeps you on your toes was disappointed this time."
2,A Real Disappointment,"I've always enjoyed Archer's novels, and I've read them all. When I picked up First Impression and read the first 62 pages, I thought this one might surpass all the others. Then around page 64, 9-11 (yes, THE 9-11) occurs. The heroine, still covered with ash from climbing blindly down through smoke and fallen bodies from the 60th floor, vows to stop the bad guy from defrauding a woman in England by stealing her painting.Hello? She stops to vomit after watching body after body leap from the building and splat on the pavement, and she cares about art? The fires aren't out, the cloud hovers over the city, emergency personnel are dying, and she's going to prevent some old lady in England from being ripped off? And of course, the bad guys are hot on her trail to kill her. You know what? If she can drive away from New York on 9/12 with art foremost on her mind...I hope they succeed.Archer gets 2 stars for the first 61 pages. They were excellent!"
2,Weaker caper novel with a glaring error,"This one was an okay airport read, but the most cursory bit of research would have shown that Canadian airspace was also shut down after 9/11. Archer's heroine would have been wasting her time driving to Canada to catch a flight. I usually hang onto hardbacks to donate to a library, but this one was left behind in the hotel without regret."
4,Fits Quatum too!,"I purchased this to hold my girl's quatum LeapPad. Everything fits perfectly inside. I fnd myself stuffing all sorts of things in it when we travel. It is very handy when going on trips to keep both the LeapPad and maps, lists, directions, etc. If you own a LeapPad product, you need to at least consider this organizer to protect your investment."
1,Won't fit color pixter,"My daughter received this case as a gift to go along with the color pixter we were getting her. Note that I specified ""color"", something that the product description doesn't mention. The case does not fit, not even close. It seems steardy and has room for two game cartridges, but frankly, that's useless in our case. If you've got a b/w pixter, it's a fine buy, otherwise don't bother. We'll be returning this case."
1,...,It started out alright and had a couple jumpers then it turned out pretty good. BUT THE ENDING RUINED IT BECAUSE THE THREE GHOSTS KILL HIM IN THE MOST RETARDED WAY WITH HORRIBLE SPECIAL EFFECTS. THE WORST PART IS WHEN THEY END IT WITH AN OUR LADY PIECE SONG!! HORRIBLE
1,"Disregard the one star on the left, this gets NO STARS!!","Guess what i was doing on Monday Night, August 1, 2005? Yep, you guessed it...watching this horrible movie that WAS NOT scary, WAS NOT interesting, WAS NOT keeping my boredom level to a minimum, and WAS NOT making me proud to have liked Michael Keaton as an actor.Want more? Wait till you see the ending? You'll laugh, you'll cry and be proud to press stop on your dvd player, put it back in it's box and 3-point it straight in the garbage (like i did!), unless you rented it..then please bring it back fast, don't you dare keep it in your home or pay a late fee for this movie!Can't believe i missed ""Fear factor"" for this!"
1,Very over rated,"This film starts good and has some interesting thought provoking parts, but the ending is dia. It makes the watcher conclude that EVP is total nonscence."
3,Made Me Glad My TV Automatically Blocks Snow,"Some good thrills and chills with a cool story line that'll make you glad if your TV is like mine and automatically blocks snow.After the tragic death of his wife, Michael Keaton's character discovers that the dead can communicate through the static/snow emitted by electronic devices (Electronic Voice Phenomenon). But there are those among the (un)dead that would rather not have any open lines of communication (but their own) to ""the other side"", and they are the ones that ultimately provide the scares.But the story line collapes a bit when more than communication with the dead becomes possible. Suddenly the future is being shown to Keaton through EVP, and that kinda messes with the whole spooky concept of EVP.Still, the story is put together well. There is substance and suspense, and it's not just a bunch of jump-out-of-the-dark thrills.Is it worth a rental if you're into the genre?...Definitely.Is it worth a purchase?..."
4,Looking for a suspense thriller?,"Really scary movies give me nighmares. Suspense thrillers make me think, ""Can this really happen"" like The Sixth Sense. If you have surround sound, this is an excellent movie to watch if you thrive on jumping during unexpected times.There's already tons of reviews out there to let you know what White Noise is about. This is my opinion of it.I find the idea of communicating with the deceased through EVP messaging (white noise on tv/radio) interesting although I was too chicken to learn more about it on the special feature section. The scenery was beautiful and I loved the architecture of the modern homes where Johnathon (Michael Keaton) lived. I watched through the credits (something I never do) to find out that this movie was filmed in Canda ~ very beautiful!White Noise is filled with suspense but the ending was a little cheesy and could have been better."
3,"Good movie, but it could've been better.","I just saw this movie last night, and I thought it was pretty good. But it could've been better. Sure it has so pretty good scares, tension, but somethings just didn't add up. But I'm not going to say what dindn't add up so I won't spoil it for anyone. Go see this movie, but see it during matinee.Rated PG-13 for violence, disturbing images, and language."
3,was not what I expected,"Hey you Horror Lovers;Well let me say that I did not see gost the way they potraid it.It was about a man, and his wife who was killed by a serial killer.they showed these gost like image on tv. Then his wife trys to contact him through the tv, you see her asking him to go here and there, to save some of the women who was also being kidnap.like I said, boring...and the ending was awfull..what makes soooupset is that they make it sound so good, when in reality, is boring..and it does not make sence..."
1,This movie makes NO NOISE AT ALL,"There's no scary or suspenseful scene in the whole movie. It's a waste of time and money.The mist (2007), the Grudge, 28 days later, Cabin Fever, Black Sheep (realeased on DVD in 2007) and Slither are the only movies on my list of Best Horror movies of all time."
2,Revenge of the 3 Stooges,"Somewhere in the Neitherworld, the spirits of the Three Stooges decide to do in death what they couldn't in life, to hunt and kill women. They con some serial killer into doing their dirty work for them, while they sit by and get off. In the meantime, the ghost of their latest victim decides to communicate with her husband in order to instruct him on how to save a missing woman who is going to soon meet the same fate she did. This is the plot, in a nutshell. The movie has a few good moments, but overall falls short on being a good movie due to the many plot holes."
5,A great compilation from the composer of Carmina Burana!,"This CD is an eclectic collection of music by Carl Orff and Gunild Keetman. There are many interesting and complex melodies like the ones found in Carmina Burana. The variety of instruments is great, including xylophones, woodblocks, voice, violins, flutes, and more. There are songs which sound very modern and also songs which sound like they're from the Middle Ages. This CD is of high quality and worth getting, especially if you enjoyed Carmina Burana."
1,it's the same stuff over and over again,"These guys run out of ideas within a couple of songs. Everybody who loves to listen to the same concept / harmonies in all the songs will love this CD. Melodies never really go beyond simple pentatonics or blues scales. I know --- some people just like this stuff, I just don't."
2,very small book,"A useful book but at times will leave you wondering -- paid a stupid expensive price for the one at the campus bookstore ($70) but for the price of this the same content is present in the Dana Oakes book on mechanical ventilation, and more.If you're not actually planning on spinning the knobs on the ventilator, it's not a bad little book, but if you're more involved in the upkeep of the machine, it'll leave you wanting."
5,In his Irish mind,"There is little question that McGahern's highly-touted writing is autobiographical. That bothers me only because he so belabors what's in his mind; it is not creative but ruminative. To me the value is that he has some special ability to ponder then express his thoughts in a particularly lucid manner, and that he chronicles Irish life of his time - not just physical and social details, but the overall emotional climate. In those regards he is a great craftsman.In ""The Leavetaking"" he deals primarily with teaching in Catholic Ireland where the state is paying but allowing the clergy to make all their Rome-directed, hate-filled, hide-bound decisions that in no way follow the teachings of Christ. The other theme, of course, is the lingering, never resolved aftermath of McGahern's mother's death, woven into the mindcloth of the protagonist. The scene is set: you, the reader, are in the Ireland of the time, then in London as the leavetaker, then flowing into the rest of your life."
1,Porter Cable 556 Plate Joiner,"I used my joiner last night and the burning wood set off the smoke detector in my shop. The problem is that the tool is VERY underpowered. It doesn't cut wood so much as burn through it. I've tried it in Pine, Oak, Cherry, etc. Always the same result. I can live with the physical design flaws but not the underpowered motor. Yes it can 'walk' but that's also a result of the lack of power, the blade is grabbing the wood without the power to cut through. It's not the best 'ergonomic' design, but I could live with that if it would only cut.This is a bad design and in my shop will soon be replaced. The only reason that I have not replaced it yet is that I substitute pocket screws for biscuits."
2,bizarro bizet,"Have any reviewers mentioned yet that this opera is supposed to be sung IN FRENCH, not Italian? And, yes, cut#7 on CD #2, although listed properly in the liner notes, is some English song that has nothing to do with this opera. (I was listening to this coming home from work very late one night, and was convinced I'd finally gone around the bend, so strange was the effect!) And the soprano, Magarini,is majorly annoying. However!!!! Alfredo Kraus defies description,as always, and is so beguiling(and precise in diction, pitch and rhythm)that maybe you should buy this CD anyway."
4,Not Quite a Waste of Money,"Carla is right that the backpack and wings are a pain. Making them removeable doesn't seem to have a useful purpose so I think they blew it there. The backpack and wings come off easily and are too hard to put back on for my four year old. It's a great looking toy, though, and my son plays with it constantly. The rockets and sounds are fun. I think this is a potentially good toy, but poorly exectuted."
2,Not worth the money,"I was really excited to receive this in the mail, to hear Buzz talk & to push the button that makes his wings pop out, but the laser attached to his arm is so big that it makes it very difficult to play with him. The first thing my 3 yr old son asked was to take the laser off (which can't be done). I wish I had spent my money on a different Buzz. My son is really not interested in this toy."
5,Needed Light-,"Since remodeling sections of the kitchen and bathroom, found I needed a decent, swivel type light to accomplish wiring, plumbing and the likes in both rooms. Since I already had a DeWalt 14.4 volt drill, made sense to try this unit. Worked out to my expectations. Was a good choice."
2,Great until it breaks,"For about a year and a half, long enough for the warranty to expire, this was an outstanding flashlight. It has a very bright light and was steady and positional. After a year and a half, the head stopped pivoting and the switch began to only work after much jiggling and fiddling. I expected better from a Dewalt product."
4,Wine know how,Very practical and well writtenThe book displays a passion which seeks to inform without predjudice.
1,Useless Book,"This was a poorly written, unintelligent book. The author states that the many works by Leonardo and Michelangelo are not Art, but Duchamp's urinal signed ""R. Mutt"" is Art. The author contradicts herself on many occasions and I would not recommend it to anyone with a critical mind. Not only does the author not make a good point, but her writing is mediocre at best. I had to read this book for a class, but it is headed for the garbage."
2,alright,"ok really didnt get in to it too much was free anyways from the online store, but good fine for people who like this"
2,Bad attempt to make a movie out of a tv series,"When I ordered this I thought I was getting the pilot plus one or two other episodes from the TV series tracker, what I got was a poorly edited attempt to make a movie from the bare bones of three episodes (the pilot and two episodes from near the end of the series). In order to fit these three episodes into 143 minute running time they cut the episodes to the bare minimum, yet for some reason left in five minutes of flash backs that made perfect sense for tv episodes that are shown weeks apart but much less sense when we had seen scenes less than half an hour before. What really made me mad is the fact that they didn't include the last episode in the mix, so all you have is a poorly edited movie without a true ending. You would be better off recording the episodes off of the Sci-Fi channel while waiting for them to release the full season."
5,Enchanting,"The music from 'The Virgin Suicides' is really beautiful. If one band manages to put together instrumental harmonies with well-placed and well-played synths, from time to time adding lyrics as well, it is Air.And 'The Virgin Suicides' is the band's best release, which demands a lot! The main theme is repeated exactly on the spots of the CD where you long to hear it again.Beautifully introduced with 'Playground Love', sung by Gordon Tracks, and ending in the somber 'Suicide Underground' which will bring back memories to those who have seen this poetically sad film.A masterpiece. And I was never even a fan of electronic music before. Then came Air.Truly a masterpiece..."
3,More please...,"Air hit the mark totally with Moon Safari in 1998. Gorgeous sound scapes providing the soundtrack to every hair salon in town and background music to travel programs on the BBC. They also scored a few hits with ""Sexy Boy"", ""Kelly Watch the Stars"" and ""All I Need"". What worked so well about Moon Safari was the melding of great pop songs alongside the ambient easy concoctions. Sadly there's only one great pop song on The Virgin Suicides (incidentally the only vocal track as well). ""Playground Love"" is again way too good (as was ""All I Need"" and ""You Make it Easy"" on Moon Safari) and although the rest of the CD is enjoyable and listenable, it lacks the cohesiveness of the previous album. It's still a delightful experiment (bearing in mind and it is a soundtrack - from Sofia Coppola's interesting looking film of the same name) but I am hoping for another great pop album from Air."
3,good movie music,"From the perspective of someone who has not yet seen the movie, I expect this is excellent for the film. Each song is short, and not so in your face that you would be distracted by what is happening on screen, but rather something that would really enhance what is being seen. At times in sounds like what Radiohead would sound like were they to get into a more electronic sound. The most frightening track, and probably the best track is ""Dead Bodies"" which takes a dancy beat and adds the almost chorus sounding noises that they added in several other songs and combines them. The combination of the song, and the title, and your own imagination make you feel uncomfortable with what you're hearing. They take instrumental music, and pound in a strong sense of emotion into the listener."
5,Great Music,"To be honest I was not aware the there was such musical output from Armenia, simple great and the singing was breath taking, when you are into religious music, do yourself a favor buy it, you will not regret it!"
4,Captivating,"David Rose's depiction of what it was like as a prisoner at Guantanamo Bay is truly captivating. He precisely describes every detail of the harsh and brutal living conditions the prisoners (most of whom were not even involved with the 9/11 attacks) had to endure. It is remarkable that prisoners even made it out of Gitmo alive since these prisons were transformed more into concentration camps reminiscent of the Nazis. After reading this book, it is hard to imagine that a country that stands for freedom and the American way could subject innocent people to cruel forms of torture simply because they were in the wrong place at the wrong time. It is disgusting how prisoners were treated and even more disgusting in the way our own president allowed it to happen. It makes one wonder at how truly fair and democratic this country is if places like the prisons at Guantanamo Bay exist."
1,not a good buy,"cheap, one of the arms broke and then about 5 mins of it up in the air it came tumbling down. It also needed a tail :-("
5,As good as it gets!,"I came to this book through a novel I just read, Arcadia Falls by Rand Johnson. In his novel, Johnson alludes to both The French Lieutenant's Woman and The Magus and since I loved Arcadia Falls, I thought I'd check Fowles out. Fowles is obviously an influence: the love of nature, the mysterious woman, the ending that both surprises and mystifies - and now I see why. His language is gorgeous, the characters real and compelling, the story spellbinding, and through his quotes he provides a historical context for the story that enriches it even more by revealing the transcendent humanity of people who lived in a cultural milieu far different from ours. A truly great book!"
3,Expected more,"I went into this expecting a beautiful Victorian love story. I got, instead, a disjointed tale of a mentally ill woman and a weak man. After finishing it, I was left empty and confused. This is definitely not an easy novel to read. The author jumps back and forth from multiple story lines to what seems to be Fowles' own religous views, and bits of Victorian history. The book, in my opinion, is self-serving to say the least. Academics may enjoy dissecting TFLW, but for the casual reader it may well be a big tedious disappointment."
1,"worst book classified as ""literature"" ever",utterly boring. do yourself a favor and read anything else.
3,The French Lieutenant's Woman,"The French Lieutenant's Woman is a Victorian novel by a modern author - the revered John Fowles. The novel concerns a love triangle between a young man on an income, his fiancé, and the mysterious and independent Sarah.Throughout the novel, Fowles takes numerous opportunities to speak directly to the reader in asides that describe the process of writing fiction from an author's perspective. Fowles also speaks directly to the reader to provide some historical information about the Victorians and their age. These asides are enjoyable and make the characters seem less removed from our own time.One quibble: the final resolution of the plot was a bit stilted (the characters basically stand up and explain themselves) and not very satisfying. I'm still not sure I fully understand Sarah's motives. The rest of this novel is very well done, though."
4,Hints at the greatness to come,"I'm being a bit generous with my rating: if Pratchett were to write this one now, I'd probably score it lower. However, for a second try, he did pretty good.I'm reading the series out of order, so the start (which requires knowledge of ""The Colour of Magic"", which I haven't read) was a bit jarring. Easy enough to get over that, though.The story was okay, and had a fair amount of chuckles and laugh-out-loud moments (horse d'oveures, anyone?) Pratchett will do worse in the future of the series, but by and large will do much better, too. Like the title of my review says, this hints at the talent that will come."
4,A Trip Through The Light Fantastic,"This was the first ""Diskworld"" novel I read and re-read and re-read again. The book starts with the syrup like flow of light accross a truely fantastic landscape; a flat world that sits uppon the backs of four enormas elephants whom in turn stand on the shell of the impossibley large space swimming sea turtle The Great A'Tuin.Enter the hero, or rather antihero, Rincewind the Inept, a ""wizzard"" who has never performed even the slightest feat of magic, and his naive companion Twoflower, the Diskworld's first (and, hopefully, last!) tourist. They are forever followed by the Luggage, a traveling trunk with a bad attitude (and possably one of the greatest literary characters ever imanged). These three companions take us on a wild romp through the lands of the multiverse's only turtle bound world.You have to read it to believe it. Take a trip down The Light Fantastic and see for yourself. . ."
4,Enjoyable,"I'm just getting into the disc world series and definitely enjoying the random humor and happenstances.While I'm liking it so far, I may be headed to the library to check out the other 29 or so books in the series."
2,Not that great,"I bought this mainly because it uses the same battery as the drills I have, overall the light is good (although no beam shape adjustment) but the balance is pretty poor when the flex neck is extended. Hopefully will be able to find replacement bulbs cheaper than the ones listed here on-line."
3,Hooked on strawberries!,"I remember liking the song strawberries when I first heard it on the radio, but it wasn't until I heard it recently that I decided to buy the cd. Most of the songs are ok, but the stand out by far is Strawberries. With it's sexy undertones it really gets you in the mood ! Not only can Smooth rap but she has a sexy singing voice too!"
3,Honestly Speaking on Smooth's Reality,"I love Smooth. No I really mean, I love Smooth. But I wanted to remember those brilliant blasts from the past. This Album doesn't quite do it for me. The title album ""Smooth"" is without a doubt the Bomb. I could play it from start to finish with a yawn. So ""Reality"" will have to take a back seat."
5,Highly recommended for any who wish to make database management part of their repertoire,"Professionals with limited knowledge about databases or SQL will still be able to work with both thanks to the expert advice by SQL author Robin Dewson in BEGINNING SQL SERVER 2005 FOR DEVELOPERS FROM NOVICE TO PROFESSIONAL. Terms are defined and fully explained each step of the way, the basics of data manipulation and SQL Server language are revealed, and chapters for developers and database administrator alike cover all the basics; from creating indexes and structuring a database to working with the data. Highly recommended for any who wish to make database management part of their repertoire.Diane C. Donovan, EditorCalifornia Bookwatch"
3,Kids keep carrying it away,"Seems like a good concept, but my preschoolers won't let it stand against the wall long enough for the cat to try it. It sits flat on the floor, and our cat does not use it. Cat prefers the SuperScratcher box (also made of corrugated cardboard) which has a wider and longer scratching surface."
5,Very well written text,"I purchased this text as a requirement for a distance education class (Research Methods in Psychology-University of Utah). I was dreading the text...how could ""research methods"" be anything but dull and dry? I was very pleasantly surprised by the text. The text is extremely well written, entertaining, and presents the material with many examples, and careful descriptions. The authors were very careful with their writing, and did a great job! I highly recommend this text."
4,Good for backups of computer,"I purchased 2 of these and connected them to my pc's, and configured weekly back ups of all of my files.I've been happy with them, good value for the price and plenty of storage space for my needs."
2,Mine died in less than a year,"Out of the box it was great, high speed transfers, both USB and firewire, though I could have done without ll the included apps, google search really didn't do much for me. I got the click of death within 7 months and lost all the data on board. Looking through the reviews this seems to be a fairly common experience. Class action?"
5,Western Digital External 500mb drive,"I use this drive to compliment Time Machine on my iMac. It is always on and always completely out of mind because it is the quietest external drive I have ever had. Top it off, it looks great too."
2,"Lots of Disk Space, But make sure you have 2 for back up","Hopefully they will invent Flash drives that have large amounts of spacebecause Hard Disk are not trust worthy, as I have learned from my own expirience. So if you buy this, buy 2 of them. One as your main and one as your back up. They are just to fragile. Overall its not a bad product and will et you by for a while till the fash drives with 500GB make thier apperance!"
4,a life saver,"i'm the worst thing that ever happened to any computer because I seriously have computer break down almost about every other month. I've been through 3 computers in the past 3 years and ive lost a lot of information as a result. I bought this as a chrstmas present for myself and backup-ed all my information and 2 days later my computers hard drive crashed and I had to get it replaced. Fortunately I only lost about 2 days worth of information which wasnt anything much at all and I now consider this thing a life saver!I haven't had any problems with it so far, but then I only use it monthly to back up my stuff. However my dad has one too and he's had it for months with no problems. It's quiet and doesnt get hot.It also works fine with Vista and the vista back up wizard so thats def a plus!so far, im satisfied with this product"
1,I wish there were 0 stars,"I bought this - transferred 200GB of data to it, and next time I used it all the data, and the format of the drive was gone. It said I needed to reformat the drive. This has happened twice now. With so many people claiming this is defective it is no wonder they are on sale everywhere.A small note: The 1TB version works great."
3,Was good during its days,You get smaller faster ones now in the market which are passport size and easy to carry.This is good for home office usage. I used one for a few years and it was easy to use esp the My Book software that helps you backup files easily
5,Big Bang for the Bucks,"I have to assume that the folks writing bad reviews of this unit are newbies to PC's or just expect too ...... well nuff said.This review is of the ""Essentials"" model, $136 at purchase time. The unit was running within 2 minutes of opening the box. It's attached to a PC that's less than a year old running XP. It's silent and copied 1702 files totaling 582 MB in 2 min 15 seconds. After a 45 min reformate to NTFS (vs FAT-32 it arrived formated for) it's doing fine.Can not comment on the included software as I did not want it and used the format to get rid of it. It might be helpful to some,but I backup files as necessary and don't need a mirror image. Very good buy for the money."
1,Worst Purchase ever!,Take it as a warning and don't buy this product. Worked the first time we plugged it in an transferred 30 gb worth of photos and videos of my baby and family. Thank god we decided to check them on the drive before deleting them from our laptop and guess what?? We could not access the drive after that. It kept on coming with an error message and couldn't be opened....so it was dead in just one day.Just wasn't worth for even a cent. It was a piece of trash!!
4,Impressive but....,"I am only giving this product four stars because it can't walk the dog :-pIt is a lovely piece of kit that looks good, and works great. Oh and it is so good value for money too!Highly recommended!"
5,HARD DRIVE,"Its amazing all the storage capacity this book has, its simply accesible and friendly to use, juts plug in and you are ready to upload tons and tons of music, videos, photos, you name it."
1,Device Not Recognized,"This was my third external hard drive; I thought the price for this device was too good to be true, but I had faith in the WD name. After more than an hour, I was still unable to get this hard drive to work. My previous two drives were a breeze to install, but this one was absurd. The online ""help"" was useless, and even the various tips and tricks from online reviews did not work.Even if I got the drive to work at this point, I'm still returning it. I need a drive I can rely on; if this one is so flakey right out of the box, what's it going to be like in a year?"
1,Doesn't live up to WD's reputation,"I purchased two of these in September, one for myself, and one for my mother. I have been a fan of Western Digital, and have several other drives of theirs. This series is simply not up to the quality I expect from Western Digital.Both drives failed within a month of purchase and had to be replaced by Western Digital. Now one of the replacements is showing symptoms of failing as well. Replacing these drives might not have been so terrible if Western Digital's customer service had responded to inquiries in a timely manner (It took approximately 10 emails and a month of time before I could get them to reply) and had sent the correct power adapter with both of the replacement drives.Based on my previous experience, I might still consider Western Digital drives, but I definitely will not be purchasing from the MyBook line ever again. They are cheaper because they are a sub-par product."
2,persistant shutdown,On a daily basis I must reboot my computer so that it is able to find this unit. I have quickly lost confidence in this item and have decided to purchase a DVD recorder to back up my important files. Regretfully I cannot recommend this item.
3,I have some problems with it,"The first drive arrived defective (with bad sectors). Western Digital offered immediate replacement. The customer service was good. Anyway, I replaced it through Amazon (they really have a great service there!!!), and received a new hard drive the day after.The second one has no bad sectors, but still when I am trying to backup things directly to the drive, it always fails in the middle. I need to backup to my internal hard drive and then copy it to the external."
1,Buyer Beware,"I purchased this drive on October 28, by Nov. 15 it was no longer functioning. I purchased the drive to use as music storage -- spent dozens of hours digitizing 400+ albums. the drive became corrupted and impossible to restore without spending mucho dinero. The Western Digital service site is a disgrace. I have owned Maxtor and Seagates, I'll never purchase another WD."
1,Western Digital,i had one that was like this after a year and half the thing Fryed the hard drive and the Chip bored with it so if ya get one of theses be Careful it may fry after a few years.p.s i hardly used mine by the way
3,Off to a rocky start...,"When we got the hard drive it gave us errors about the installation information being damaged, after we worked with it for a while we got it to work. It's a great product (now) and the seller got it to us really quickly and at a great price."
1,Just stoped working.,"I have 450Gb of irreplaceable pictures and personal stuff on this drive. I was pulling a few last bits from a shared drive when i got these error messages on all of the files, i canceled the files tried to access the drive and i get a message something like ""a USB device is connected"" but i can't see the HDD. I tried several different pc's, powered on and off a dozen times, and pretty much every combination of plugging/unplugging you can imagine many times over. It was never dropped or mishandled in anyway and i get a repetitious buzzing sound for about 45 seconds then nothing. Hopefully the small tech store down the road can access or repair the drive and rescue my data. It was a great drive until 8 days of ownership and it stopped working. I would send it back to WD but then my personal info is everybody's info. Kind of a catch 22 on HDD repairs/returns, no money back, your data is lost, but no one else can see what you have either. I guess if i can't have it then no one will."
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY,"Like so many other people who have purchased a Western Digital My Book Essential Edition. Mine went dead after less than a month. I will never, never purchase a WD product again. Fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me."
1,Stopped Working after two days,"This drive installed flawlessly on a new DELL Windows Vista machine. However, after two days, it disappeared. Still waiting for WD Tech help to respond to a message. The driver somehow got lost."
1,Fails to function,"Western Digital's 500 GB external HD fails to function now. We've had it for about two years. It has been used on XP and Vista machines. As of two weeks ago, the WD 500 is not recognized on any of the machines.We're read about work-arounds, but they don't work. We've checked WD's website for new drivers or patches. Nothing is available. Worse yet, Western Digital doesn't even reply when they were contacted.I know we won't buy any Western Digital product in the future. I suggest that you avoid buying this 500GB Ext. HD. Save your money.In a way, the failed WD Drive was a blessing! It was hurtful to know that they didn't care about their product and their customer's needs. But, that pain lead us to Carbonite.com where we do backups (no size limitations) for $50/year. Yeah... far less than an external HD!"
2,My Book Dies!!!,"It worked fine for about 6 months, but then without warning died on me. It says the drive is unformatted and asks if I would like to format it now? I knew I should have bought 2 of them and had one back up to the other. Some of the stuff I had on there I had been collecting for years and cannot be replaced. Don't put ANYTHING on this drive you can't afford to lose!"
4,Work well,"I bought this hard disk four month ago. So far, it still work well for me. This hard disk cost is good. One little problem that I have is that it takes about 1 minute after it is connected to my computer until my computer can access to the hard drive."
2,Croaked in less than a year,"When it works, it works great. Mine ran continuously for about 10 months. Then one day it made that ""click-of-death"" sound, and that was the end of it."
2,Good Hard Drive Until it Died After 1 Year,"I purchased this drive last year and used it to store my Time Machine backups. It was quiet and attractive looking and served the purpose well. However, it just broke down a mere 2 months out of warranty. Classic. The hard drive had an easy life too, so this is totally unacceptable to me.When I told a friend of mine about the incident, he reported that he has had two of these break prematurely on him as well."
4,Night Stalks the Gray House,I loved the gothic theme that surrounded this book. It was filled with suspense and kept me guessing to the end. It's worth reading.
3,Night Stalks the Gray House,I love to read books by undiscovered writers. This book has a lot of potential. I loved the character development. THe storyline could have come out of any newspaper. It is a good book.
4,Night Stalks the Gray House,This book grabbed me from the first page and I held on for the ride. The book provided enough drama to move my emotions along and I found myself involved in the story until I put it down.
3,"Damn, this is an old recording...","Boy, I was pretty excited about getting a recording of thisAWESOME opera, and now I know why it's so cheap. This recording is pretty old... it was recorded around 1955. A lot of the music is a tad fuzzy and hollow sounding. If you're into really old recordings of awesome operas, then this CD is for you. Otherwise, go for the Domingo recording..."
2,What Happened....??,"Maybe I've forgotten, but where did this love for Coleman come from? I know Sarah Booth had this ""relationship"" with Harold the Banker.....but I don't remember the sheriff ever being a factor. I thought this was by far the weeakest in the series. I have really liked all of the others, but this one didn't do it for me. I guess, as a Yankee, I really don't get the Daddy's Girl thing. Thank God I'm from the solid Northeast. I would not make a good Southern woman.....and I wouldn't want to be. But I'll still read the books."
3,Keeps Him Occupied For a While,"Our little guy likes this ok, but I wished that it provided a little more stimulation. The music cuts off after just a few moments and the toys don't really do much. The only other one i've tried is the similarly priced Rainforest and I think that it is a little better."
5,Baby LOVES this!!!,"My 2 month old son loves playing on the mat. It's also great for him to do little exercises on...learning how to roll over, tummy time, etc."
4,Baby loves this activity mat!,"Our little guy loves playing on this mat. Mat offers fun from dangling toys as well as lights and squeaks on the floor.The sounds on ours isn't working very well - the music is playing out of tune...but that's not such a big problem.Baby spends lots of time playing on the mat reaching, pulling, gazing into the mirror, and talking to his little animal friends.Highly recommend!"
3,nice baby gym,"i purchased this gym 2 months ago and i think i got this a little too late. my baby enjoyed it for awhile, but out grew it quickly, she's now 8-months-old. but compared to other baby gyms i like it the most. all the toys are removable so she can still play with them and it has a little mirror so she can look at herself."
5,"Bright, light, travels well and easy to clean","My son really enjoyed playing with this toy (baby shower gift). The animals are enticing and colorful, the music and lights kept his attention early on and it is super easy to set up and put away. The mat is easy to wash and cleans up like a champ - packs flat for storage and travel (especially if you keep the plastic case it comes in - it even has a handy carry handle). I wish I had gotten it out sooner as he outgrew it far too fast (early sitter and walker - lost interest in laying in one place). Will DEFINITELY be keeping this in case another little one comes along... and it will be brought out much earlier next time :)"
4,Great but slightly overkill,"My gadget-guy husband picked out this particular model, which my son loves. However, the lights and the music are not features that we really use at all. The standard one would have been perfectly sufficient!"
5,A life-saver!,"Of all the things I bought as a ""new mom"" this activity center was one of the best! I got it for my daughter when she was 6 weeks old and she enjoyed it right away. She would play, then nap, then play some more. The toys are great, and I also put my own toys in the gym, for variety. I used it at home and also brought it to all our outings at friends' houses since it folds up nicely. Hour and hours of fun, for several months!"
2,Wrong model number -Tiny Love super deluxe,"I purchased this product.After receiving it ,noticed it was an older model No:810 .The latest tiny love super deluxe is 1210.Please be careful when u purchase this product"
1,Poorly made and unsafe,"This product is poorly made and unsafe. One of the arches snapped in two after less than six months of use. When I contacted the company for a replacement part they indicated that they were out of the arches and there was nothing they would do without a receipt. I explained to the representative that I received the item as a gift and did not have a receipt. Still, nothing. Poor product, poor customer service, not something I would recommend."
5,What a Fun Toy!,I received the Gymini as a baby shower gift and couldn't wait until the baby could use it. It is a lot of fun!! I enjoy playing with it too. My 2 month old daughter loves the Mozart music. The bright colors of the animals and mat keep her attention. She loves to coo at the baby in the mirror. The Gymini folds easily and can be tucked out of the way.
3,Needed to modify,"When I took the gym out of the shipping box I saw there were many award stickers on the gym's plastic bag so I had high hopes for the product. Then I soon discovered that as with all products, it might work for some but not others. Our baby didn't like the lights on the playmat so we took it out and taped it to the top of the arches and now she squeals in delight when the light feature is on. The gym's mat prooved to be boring and not stimulating enough for our daughter so we put a different play mat (with no arches) on top of the gym's mat and now our dauther is more engaged while using the gym. The quality of the music is great and the hanging toys are also very nice. Amazon, kudos to you for not only shipping to APO military addresses but for extending your free super saver shipping to APO addresses as well. I only wish you had a no hassle return policy. All in all, this is a good product, it just didn't work for our daughter as much as we would have liked."
4,Entertaining,"We recieved this as a hand me down from our neice. We tried our son on it when he was 1 month old but at the time he wasn't very interested in it. He is 3 months old now and enjoys batting at the animals and kicking them. He can even grab them and hold on to them now. It usually keeps his interest for atleast 15 minutes. There are 2 reasons I didn't give it 5 stars. The childrens song setting is not continuous so you constantly have to restart it, however the classical music setting is continuous (but the song is a little annoying to me). The other thing that bothers me is even when you turn the switch to off if something (like our chihuahua) bumps it the music still plays (this has woke up my baby before)- not a big deal if you don't have a curious pet."
5,new parents love it.,"The techy-and-detailed couple love it, which really means something although their baby is too small to try it. Will update the review after real field experiments with its normal user. :D"
5,Baby's first giggles here!!,"This is so much fun and our baby made her first giggle when we pulled the elephant down and it vibrated back up. She still plays with the toys and we found them to be great to attach to her carrier for carseat and stroller toys on the go! Even though our baby is almost walking, she still plays in this and especially the light up flowers...those are her favorites and she has figured out how to activate the music and squeak and rustle sounds...highly recommend this!Also...some of the other toys like this used a Boppy or pillow or come attacted with one...we used our pillow sometimes and it worked excellent for more support in tummy time activities and so our baby was not always on her back."
3,"Interesting for baby, but have bad smell","My 3 month old baby was interested in gym, especially in giraffe. She can play about 15 minutes without me, and it is good.But arches have bad chemical smell like something plastic from dollar tree. I was thinking he can go away, but he can't. So I returned the gym."
5,LOVE it!!!!,"I love this play mat & so does the little one!!! I like the colors & theme & he really seems to love the parrot & monkey. Great from the very beginning!!! Little guy loves playing on the mat & grabbing / kicking the toys. The mirror will be great for tummy time when he actually starts to enjoy tummy time. My only complaint is that the ""nursery rhyme"" song setting doesn't play very long. It only plays a small snippet of the song, has to be restarted by touching the music portion of the mat."
4,"Exactly what it says, best for the price",I was looking for an affordable play mat and this is exactly what it is. Baby is captivated and the toys are removable. The lights are minimal but still functional. I like it and so does the baby. Great for the price.
4,GREAT!,This is a GREAT item to have for little ones! Tummy time is so much fun with all there is to do on this play mat! I wish I would have had this item with my other 2 children!!!
2,Not worth the money!!!,My daughter HATES this toy. She has had in since 2 months and she is now 5 months and she STILL HATES it. It is too busy. She gets over stimulated and then upset with it. When I take most of the hanging toys off of it she is OK with it but then gets board. The musical flowers don't entertain her and the angle that the mirror is at makes it almost impossible for her to see herself in it without being so close to it her nose it practally touching it. I would say don't buy it. Spend less money on a similar one but don't spend the big bucks on this one. My recommendation would be take the money and buy and exersaucer. They will also last longer.
1,My baby hated this,"I am shocked to see that this play mat has such high reviews. I tried and tried with this thing and my son absolutely hated it. In fact, he rolled over for the very first time while being on it, because he was screaming in agony. The toys were cute, but he didn't really get into playing with them until he was older and I sent the mat itself to goodwill. We lived in a small space at the time and I didn't have enough space to leave it out all the time. It folded up fairly easily, but not that easy. Another negative aspect is that it is spot clean only, which is kind of gross for spit up. Overall, there are other toys out there that have a longer lifetime of use. However, sounds like a lot of babies do like it."
2,Baby did not like it,The baby did not like this toy. The stuffed elephant and giraffe are the only things she liked about this toy. We used it for about 30 minutes and once the baby starts to move well the mat isn't big enough. I think this is better for children under 3 months.
4,Good Entertainer for Baby,"I bought this 2 weeks ago for my daughter who is now 3 months old. At first, she didnt seem interested in the toys and would cry after 10 minutes. Now, she loves to bat and grab on to the toys above her. I added the baby wind chimes (her favorite toy) which she can swing or kick at and they make noise, and I added a mirror above her so she can see herself while on her back. She likes to look in the mirror while on her tummy also.She doesnt seem to care about the music, but the lights are cute. This toy buys me about an hour a day of entertainment, which is necessary b/c I work from home! Defintitely recommend it"
3,Pricey,I bought this one and cheap ones and the boys didn't know the difference. I would stick to the cheaper ones. My babies didn't even notice the little extra bells and whistles.
2,not so popular for my 3 month boy,"I have to admit that i purchased the mat after i read the great reviews, and I bought it with my $50 gift card. Basically I only spent $5 for the mat, so that I don't suffer too much economically. But I rather I haven't bought it simply because my son doesn't like it so much. It takes some space and I am in a dilemna to give away. But it is not a cheap toy. My three months old can spend 5 minutes on the mate before he cries. the mirror caught his attention sometimes. Afterwards i have to fold it and unfold it when use - not worth the energy.But I also heard good comments from my friends who have a baby daughter. So it really depend on individual kids. What i recommend is to let your baby try on it before you made the buying decision, or buy from where you could return the item easily."
2,Over rated,"I had received this at my baby shower. She is now almost 4 months, the only thing she really likes is the blinking lights, but only for a few minutes. The mirror is a joke, she has alot more fun when I'm holding her looking in the bathroom mirror. Every baby is different on what they like to look at and play with. Now I think it's really cool, if I were her age, I'd love it, but oh well:o("
3,I love it alot but my baby doesn't !,"I like this mat since I saw it and then I bought it for my 2.5 month old baby girl. However, after it arrives, my baby doesn't like it much. She can spend time by herself under it about 5 minutes and cries. I have to put her hand to touch the hanging toys and shake the rattles for her, and this can keep her interest around 10 minutes and that's it. I hope in the future she will play with it more; otherwise I have to return this cute stuff."
4,Great fun for infant right from birth!,"I got this gift from my baby registry and my son loves this! We started using it when he was a few days old. But now that he's 15 weeks, he really enjoys playing with it! We use it several times daily for play and tummy time. Its easy to clean with the exception of the crinkly paper in the elephant and the butterfly on the mat--it got balled up in the wash and I haven't ""unwrinkled"" it...not very practical placement for something that goes into my washing machine weekly! The overhead toys are interchangeable which is nice. The music isn't so great, it plays the same classical song over and over and for some reason the Nursery song stops playing after the first round and won't restart for a couple of minutes. I don't use the music much because I find it annoying."
4,Great Playmat,"This playmat is a wonderful toy. The dangling toys encouraged my son to reach up, and the mirror was what got him to roll over. The great thing about it is that you can easily pack it up and take it anywhere with you. The toys come off and attatch to the car seat. Also, what I liked about it is the fact that it can grow with your child. Now that my son is 11 months old I use the bottom as a little blanket for him to play on, plus he still loves the music playing in the background. As a new parent, I would highly recommend this toy. You and your child will get much fun and use out of it. It is also a great developmental toy, which is why we bought it."
4,Keeps Her Attention and Makes Her Giggle,"My little 4-month-old girl received this as an early Christmas gift and we knew from the moment we put her down on it that she loved it. She grabbed the little parrot, swatted at the monkey, crinkled whatever she could get her hands on and stared into the mirror.We love watching her play on the mat and she can spend a full hour playing around, amusing herself the entire time! She even enjoys tummy time on this. She hates tummy time on anything else. Anything that makes tummy bearable is an amazing treat for all involved."
4,Cute and entertaining!,"Our son is now 4 and a half months, and he still likes this playmat. He likes to kick the pad and hear the music play, and there are lots of toys to bat around. The only small issue I have is that he really has to kick hard to start the music. When he was less than 2 months, he didn't kick hard enough to make the music play very much. It would also be nice to have two choices for volume. The sound is quite loud. Other than that, this is a great choice."
2,"5 stars in terms of quality and activity, 1 star in terms of use.","We went all out and bought the total playground and a lamaze mirror which I strapped to the arches, lots of extra toys and it's just been a bust! You just do not know if your baby will enjoy lying on the floor and looking up at things, our prefers to be sitting or upright. This toy has proved useless for us and I would highly recommend to people to wait until after birth to see what their little one likes before splashing out, either that or buy second hand where at least you can get your money back! In terms of quality this is one of the better mats I've seen, and if you can get your use out of it, great, by all means it will prove an excellent purchase."
2,Eh... wish I had bought a different one,"Although this playmat looks great on the internet, in actuality it leaves a lot to be desired. Yes, it has colorful toys that can easily be moved to various locations and the mat is nice to look at if they're on their tummy. However, the criss-cross bars over their head are at such a low angle that all of the toys pretty much hang directly over them and touch their face. My son, by a couple months old, had to keep his face to the side because he didn't like the toys touching him. When I saw other brands and saw how much higher their bars were - and therefore how much higher their toys hung - I realized the downside to this one. Wish I had seen some in person before registering for this one..."
1,Liked it BUT...,"First off, I want to say that I my son likes this play mat. I on the other hand have some concerns. We have had this play mat for 7 months of use.Pros: Interesting, fun and engaging.Cons: Lights and music broke after 2 months(right around the time when the lights would have been a lot of fun for him).The toy animals are stuffed with this really fine stuffing that is seeping through the fabric and would not be good if digested. It seeps through like fine nylon curly hair."
2,Nothing happens,"Fever and Spear is an interesting read, but VERY slow. The lead character has a special talent for discerning whether someone is lying, and for predicting how they will act during a crisis. Most readers of suspense fiction would expect that this talent will be put to some use, and that thereby will hang the tale . . . . but that's not what happens here. It takes the whole book to get the talent described and shown in operation; and then the book ends. In the meantime we find out a considerable amount about the lead character's ex-wife, his father (a journalist who was on the Republican side during the Spanish Civil War) his academic friends in England, and so on.But nothing HAPPENS.Don't read this expecting a thriller. On the other hand, if you want a psychological study of a character, you might consider it."
2,Limp light,"I am a huge fan of DeWalt products and own a dozen or so DeWalt tools. This light was a disappointment. If you want to use the battery as a base and point the lamp at something the flexible shaft can't retain it's position. Worse yet, as the light starts to sag the whole thing can topple. The problem is the flexible shaft is not very stiff. The light output is very bright and remains charged for a long time."
2,Disappointing Product,The DW919 is unstable and falls over when the neck is extended forward past a certain point. You can bend the lower neck back and the upper neck forward to partly compensate for this but this limits how far the light can be extended. Also the neck is not stiff enough to maintain all positions of the light. DeWalt need to improve this product.
4,Good bulbs but...........,"They are CRAZY expensive. I've been buying them for years for my Panasonic Drill, Impact Driver, Flashlight set. I use it every day for work. After the bulbs are a few weeks old and the light is bumped hard while moving for a better view, the bulbs burn out.They are available from Lowes Stores for $8.99:[...]I wish there was a 14.4 Volt LED replacement.............??????????Please let me know: jimkerhin@yahoo.com"
1,where is the complete book?,"I was thoroughly disappointed and disgusted when I read this version of the book. My complaint is not with the author or the subject matter but rather with this particular publisher.THE BOOK IS NOT COMPLETE! This book is only the first 22 chapters. I understand that large print may be divided into different books. However, no where on the cover or title page is it mentioned that this is only 22 chapters out of 50+DON'T BUY THIS VERSION!!!!!!!!! Seek another publisher."
2,Craptatstic,"My main question is what are all those acclaimed reviewers smoking? I buy the book, loving practically all of Jane Austen's work, because there is a quote from the New York Time Book Review saying ""The text virtually breathes Jane Austen."" Can I just say the text of this book probably has Jane Austen rolling in her grave. Emma Tennant did not do justice to ANY of the characters.....stay far far away from this book."
4,Great music -- lipsync problem?,"The music and performance is great. My only gripe relates to the lipsync, but I'm unsure as to where the problem lies…Set-up:* blu-ray player (Philips, top 2010 model) connected via HDMI into NAD C390DD stereo amp, and picture passed on from NAD via HDMI to Philips TV (2010 model 7000 series)* with normal picture setting, the picture is horrendously out of sync with the sound -- particularly noticeable at the start of Afterlife (drum sticks)* the NAD doesn't allow for delaying the sound; most surround amps do allow for this* setting the picture to game mode (turning off image procesing) noticeably reduces the delay, but it is still there -- and this makes the picture somewhat noisy/mis colored--Other concert blu-rays show some delay in standard mode, but not in game mode.--Ok -- the problem *could* be in the hardware set-up. But the problem is more noticeable in this blu-ray than in others."
4,Seems to be working!,"I've been losing a pound a week since starting this. I don't see how their website can claim 7 lbs a week, that's just crazy and unhealty. I changed up my diet a bit too, no more fast food and limited processed foods. Haven't started working out yet, but I know that will help. Overall I'm happy with this stuff!"
3,Just another worthless weight loss product,"I have not lost any weight and it does not curb my appetite. Might work for some, but did not for me."
2,Does not work,"Do not waste your money on this product, it is a waste of money. Try other brands they work better, however remember these pills not matter what brand screw up your stomach."
5,it works,i have tried other carb blocking products and none of them has worked like this one. i will not purchase any other carb blockers except this but the only thing is that i can only find it on Amazon. i still love it. fixing to buy two more bottles.
2,Don't work,"I used this product for a month and didn't notice that it helped at all. I exercise for about two hours a day normally. However, I thought I would try this product along with my normal exercise program. There was no difference when using this product."
3,THIS BOOK NEEDED A BETTER EDITOR,"The people who SHOULD read this book-- Bush's blind-faith ""fast-food"" security moms and NASCAR dads- won't because it's too long, too repetitious, and dare I say it? B-O-R-I-N-G for pages on end. I don't fault Kelley as much as I fault her editor who has clearly lost his or her blue pencil. Careful pruning would have sharpened the text and quickened the pace of the book. Someone like the legendary Maxwell Perkins would have whipped this book into shape. Unfortunately,few editors line-edit these days because of heavy work loads. Many are little more than ""traffic cops"" routing manuscripts from copy editor to author and back, to the art department, to the printer, etc. Kitty Kelley deserved better. And she surely does not deserve to have her book supressed by the Bush machine. Which proves one of Kelley's main points: Absolute power corrupts absolutely."
1,Kitty Kelley is another Michael Moore,"This book is like a Michael Moore movie, untrue and unkind and UNFIT FOR DISTRIBUTION. I'll take BILL O'REILLY and the SWIFTBOAT VETS over these clowns any day. I've come to the true and distinct conclusion that Republicans are much smarter than Democrats. I'm embarrassed to admit I was a democrat for 25 years, but I blame the media. Until RUSH LIMBAUGH and the FOX NEWS CHANNEL, I believed all the blather the media put out there and like this book, most of what is reported or written about is distorted, if not down right untrue. We were made fools of for a long time, we should be angry."
1,Wasn't Worth My Time,"I read this book mainly out of curiosity, but I would never recommend it as a ""must read"" in time for the election. It's not even in the same league as a nonfiction book and should not be considered reliable."
1,"Like her other books, its made up garbage","Kitty Kelly has made her living off of trashing the people that just so happen to be in the news at that time. This is no exception. The surprising thing is that it took her this long to fabricate this book. She, as she freely admits, is a registered Democrat so anything she says about Pres Bush is politically motivated. She is a sleaze peddlar, nothing more!"
1,Not even one star!,"I am a democrat and I find this book disrespectfull to one of our countries leaders. I disagree with this presedent but I do not buy into this whole conspiracy theory bias that is so popular right now. The author is a the poor man's Michael Moore and I think she is trying to cash in on the whole ""bush secret life"" trip. I hope this book does not go far and America sees whjat being open minded is truley."
1,Worst writer ever...,"Another sad fairy tale for the out-of-touch liberals. I read this book at my local B&N, and did not buy it. It's an easy read, because it doesn't require any intelligent thinking from the reader. In fact, it reads quite like the comics. But, congrats to the writer for making #1 on the bestseller list, and I'm sure she's very thankful to the same people who enjoyed Fah. 9/11. For all the liberals concerned about the rich getting a tax cut, maybe they should just quit buying this crap time and time again. This book is full of deceit, lies, ""unauthorized"" info, and plenty of the author's imagination. Buy it up, libs!"
1,The Family: The Real Story of the Bush Dynasty,Ms. Kelley remains true to her mantra. To have dug up so much dirt must have indeed occupied her for quite a while. I do not think this is an accurate account of the Bushes. I believe she has maligned their characters and I do not agree with her account.
1,Like a Hershey bar for the brain!,"This book is absolute junk and belongs in the fiction dept. Bush haters will enjoy this like a Hershey bar, even though it is not based on any fact. But then again, isn't t hat what all Bush haters are about?"
3,Truth Be Told,"Even though I hate the Bush family, I have to say the book is not very well documented and the facts are not solid. It is more of New York Post, or Fox news type of reporting which allows lot of drama and assertions but little truth. The ideawas great but the execution were pure.However, I believe Slander does sell book how else would you explain the book as well as the swift boat veterans against John Kerry"
1,Have fun!,"""We've decided to suspend our normal customer review policies and rules for this title. For example, we usually prohibit ad hominem attacks. That policy in particular seems to be incompatible with presidential election year politics. Therefore, short of obscenities, reviews on this book are now a free-for-all. We take no responsibility for the following discussion. Aren't presidential election years great? Have fun!""Hey Amazon! What's good for the Swift Vets ought to be good for Kitty too! How about it?"
1,Be An Intelligent Reader,"Whether you hate Bush or love him, the real issue is whether you are using objectivity. For a book that has over 700 pages of accusations, one would expect at least one named source that is a first hand witness. Yet, Kelley lists them as confidential. The rest of Kelley's named sources in the book are all based upon these confidential sources. I'm still undecided on who I am going to vote for this election even though I'm a registered Republican. This is based upon all the facts I have rather than unproven accusations. Therefore, to make this a better country, we need to use our minds to decipher what are facts and what are fantasies. This book really should be listed under fiction since it cannot prove a single accusation. Please use your mind because when you stop using it is when someone else is doing the thinking for you."
3,Kindle edition has no index,If you're going to look anything up using the kindle edition you will need to search because there is no index. The paperback edition has an index. I read the paperback a few years ago and found it compelling.
1,Book is filled with 90% negative information,"The book is filled with dirt. As with any book I do not tend to believe unporoven facts. I am not a republican or democrat, but can tell the book is very biased and filthy."
3,Croton Silver dial watch,"Well, the watch looks nice. But when I took it to a Jeweler to have it sized, just trying to remove the links 2 of them just sort of fell apart. the watch expert said it was very hard to size because it wasn't put together real well. So I am really hoping it holds together now that it is the right size. It was a gift for my husband who will probably only wear it on the weekends. So we will have to wait and see."
1,What the heck is a vanner?,"I don't know what movie you other people have been watching, but for some sad reason, I have seen this movie multiple times, and it is <b>not</b> good! Unfortunately, now that I have seen all of these rave reviews, I must purchase it for my collection. It was a great bad movie when I was 14 and really discovering my own sexual nature, but it is not something that I would watch for its stellar acting or plot qualities.Thank you for allowing me to share my thoughts on this film, if you can call it that."
5,WELL WRITTEN and INSIGHTFUL,"Like a medic writing from the trenches about the ravages of war, Dr. Cwayna shares his unique perspective as a medical doctor who has dedicated his life to the service and medical treatment of homeless youth. Dr. Cwayna provides expert insights into the needs of these kids and the inadequacies of our social system that are supposed to serve them. Dr. Cwayna goes beyond an analysis of these systems, he introduces us to the unique kids he works with and shares the pains and struggles that brought them to live on the streets. A heartfelt book by a gifted author and healer."
2,Will melt some 18v flashlights,"My local big box store sold me this bulb for my Porter Cable 18v Lithium Flashlight (model PCL-180FL). After about one half hour of continuous use the flashlight stopped working. Upon opening up the lens holder I discovered the bulb had melted through the bulb holder. Fortunately, the Porter Cable service rep took pity on me and is mailing me replacement parts so I can fix my flashlight. None the less, before buying this bulb, make sure it is truly compatible with your flashlight or you may end up destroying your flashlight. The correct bulb for the Porter Cable 18v series of flashlights (e.g. PCL-180FL and PCL-18FL) is a KPR 18v 0.3amp krypton bulb(Porter Cable part number #90534275).Ultimately what Porter Cable/Dewalt (they are the same company) need to do is release an LED conversion kit for their flashlights."
3,Not as bright as the original Ryobi bulb,"This bulb was not as bright as the original Ryobi bulb that came with the flashlight.I ended up buying the LED bulb for 20$. The LED makes similar amount of light as this bulb (so, the LED is not as bright as the original either), but extends the battery life to 6 times as much as before!"
2,18v bulbs,Product arrived on time as advertised with no problems. Shipping was outrageous. I didn't note it at the time and would not have ordered if I had of noticed. That was my fault. For $10 shipping I would have thought that it would have been hand delivered within an hour. They made good money on that one.
4,bulb,these bulbs were a good price and they were correct for the flashlight. i would buy again when i need to.
3,Kelsey Grammar's A Christmas Carol,"This version deviated from the original story in several areas, predominantly at the beginning when they depicted Scrooge's father being sent to debtor prison. That actually happened to Dicken's father and had a great influence on the author's life.All in all, this was an okay rendition. Some of the songs were very nice. Still, as a musical, it lags behind the Albert Finney classic."
1,Bah Humbug!,"Just horrible when placed beside any of its predecessors. I pride myself in owning all the various incarnations of A Christmas Carol, even the cartoon versions, but this ill-conceived, trite, uninspired, and dilute version will not be joining that esteemed group! The Albert Finney musical makes this look like a high school musical; those seeking a quality musical version should check it out instead.God help us, everyone!"
2,Rent First,It starts of well and I really liked how creative the music and dancing worked together but after the Angle of Christmas past apeared in a suductive night shirt slithiering around his bed post and then the Skeletons and dead people which had the affect of a scary hollowen movie we shut if off and were very dissapointed we had not rented it first.
1,The Worst Movie Version Of A Christmas Carol.,I read the Christmas Carol book by Charles Dickens and I liked it and I have seen several movie adaptations that I liked but this version with Kelsey Grammer is without a doubt the worst version I have ever seen! Now he was actually pretty good as Ebenezer Scrooge but unfortunately the movie was horrible though and way too campy and the songs were absolutely dreadful! Yuck! A real stinker!
2,Musical 'Scrooge' Much Better!,"If this was the ONLY musical version of 'A Christmas Carol' I'd seen, I probably would have given it an 'ok' rating, but having seen the musical film ""Scrooge"" with Albert Finney, it is just SO much better than this made-for-tv movie, with better actors, better sets, costumes, etc. Most importantly the music and lyrics in 'Scrooge' are so much better!"
5,"My New Favorite Version of ""A Christmas Carol""","Remarkable, joyful, and touching film. Finally, the ""Christmas Carol"" I have been waiting for all these decades. It has lavish costumes and sets, great stage-type over-the-top acting appropriate for a sentimental Victorian setting, and for the first time in years, a modern musical with really beautiful music one can actually sing and hum, instead of what sounds like tuneless background music for a murder mystery. The musical numbers are outstanding, reminding me of ""Oliver,"" and the choreography is lively and made me want to get up and dance along. Can't say enough good about this film; bravo to Hallmark, Kelsey Grammer, and of course, Charles Dickens. I loved it."
2,Doesn't deliver its promise,"The idea of a book within a book, while not new, was intriguing to me; however, this version didn't deliver. The gaps between the stages of both sets of characters was annoying, and the daily detail of their lives was just tedious. Had to finish it for book club, but it was a big disappointment."
5,A classic.,Not much to say that hasn't been said about this film. It's a classic and really one of the best films ever made.
4,"""I know it was you. It broke my heart.""","This movie along with its predecessor are two of the two most amazing movies in any person's collection. This movie is often regarded as being superior to the original Godfather and in many ways it is. The plot switches from young Vito Corleone and to a struggling Michael Corleone. In the end, this movie is the greatest sequel and one of the greatest movies of all time. Best scene:Ganucci Death Sequence"
2,Boring,"I found myself falling asleep watching this movie. I don't know why anyone would think this movie is the best sequal of all time. it was too boring, although the actors were preety good."
4,Must watch after watching the first Godfather,"I enjoyed this movie and had to watch it to see what happened in the family. Al Pacino does an excellent job! Like the first Godfather movie, there's lots of action, lots of story lines, and the acting is outstanding."
2,Weaker sophmore,"Where Godfather was so good I really didn't know what to expect with Godfather 2 but to me it just seemed not to live up to the original, not that many do, but this was less than stellar. Still worth a viewing, but was the weakest in the trilogy."
3,"Half right, half something else.","His ideas, though thought provoking are hardly different then most other 'revolutionary' writers. You can chose for yourself if you agree with his views. But just thumbing through it you get a refreshing dose of self-absorbed, rightous frenzies, cash cow grinding Covey wanna be that it makes for a lovely read. I don't think I can explain it well enough. Buy this used if you can, it goes 'over the heads' of many readers. Reading books about how bad we have screwed up our country is always interesting, however finding this one gives you a good 'front and square' personality disorder. Mind that you don't lose your mind while reading his book. Remember, if his advice was really that good, he'd tell ya for free. ;)"
1,WORST Quality EVER,"When I bought this sweatshirt, it arrived in good time but, when I got the sweatshirt, it was in HORRIBLE quality, it was made from CHEAPLY made cotton, the letters were VERY poorly sown on and is probably the worst quality sweatshirt you will buy anywhere. I paid about $43 when I could get 2 sweatshirts from another store with much better quality even if it doesn't say YALE. Very poor, I would never EVER buy from here again."
3,"Very close, but not yet there....","Nice light output, nice run time. Like those features alot.However, the light won't stand on the battery base. It tips over! The goose neck is not useful and it costs (...) more than the swivel head version (which is how you end up using the product).Maybe the 14.4V or 18V have enough mass to support the goose neck, but don't bother with the 12V unit. Buy the swivel neck version. I wish I had."
3,Another re-release re-marketed,"Interesting read and politically very astute when it comes to Asian cultures in that part of the world. Written in around 1990, you would be somewhat confused as to why there is still a KGB, I really don't know why they re-released this now, but it is still a good read, if it does have somewhat of a limp ending. The author goes into a lot of character development but falls short in most areas, perhaps if he could have seen to write a couple of hundred more pages to balance out the build up. Three and a half stars"
4,cute movie,"good story line, worth renting. good characters...nice scenery.i love happily ever after ending stories and this is one of them"
2,A Disappointment,"I have been a fan of Piers Anthony for many years: I have most of his novels, and have always enjoyed them . . . until now. I liked the other 3 Geodyssey books, but the quality of writing in this 4th book is surprisingly bad. The dialog and actions & attitudes of his characters is so contrived that it is hard to believe that Piers Anthony wrote this book.I am rather liberal-minded when it comes to sex & erotica, but the sex in this book is surprising graphic, and lacks good taste.The history is interesting, but Anthony has shot down his own dream of having these Geodyssey books in the classroom."
2,Read something else,"While I am a huge fan of Piers Anthony, I not only found this book very ""put down-able"" but offensive. Between the gratuitous sex on every page and the consumption of human body parts as aphrodesiacs, there was very little good story. The history parts were very good and read well, but the story part of the book was a definite turn-off for me and several of my friends. I'd stick to the other Anthony series for better entertainment."
3,informative,Quite informative on the history of tattoos in Hawaii but lacking in substance in terms of the actual designs and placement.
5,Adorable Collector Item...5 years and up...,"My daughter loves the Movie, and the Characters. Although, obviously there is not much you can do with it, kids always find a way to keep entertained. In addition, she loves just setting them up to look at also. Adorable toy...durable, hard plastic/rubber."
5,"Fun, fun, fun!","If you're in the mood to try something a little off the beaten path, musically speaking, get this CD! So many good songs, you'll be back at Amazon looking for these artists' own CD's. As others note, ""Vacation"" is one of the favorites. I also think ""Bocanuts"" is a real winner. Anyone who's ever been ""firmly attached to a bar stool"" will probably agree. And in case anyone is wondering about ""The Original Parrothead"", it's a song telling the story of how one up-and-coming singer/songwriter bumps into ""the original"" himself. I can't imagine anyone being disappointed with this CD."
4,Thongs has something for everyone.,"If you like ""beach music"", ballads, folk, serious songs, silly songs, or anything in between, there'll be something for you on this CD. The selections on this CD show the strength of some very talented independent musicians. And the proceeds go to a very good cause (Wisconsin Lake Schooner Education Association). Can't beat it for $14.99."
2,Disapointed,"this is probably the biggest disapointment I've ever had in a CD. When I bought this I was expecting the crazy Das Efx from Sewaside, Dead Serios and hold it down. If you know das efx then don't get this album. The beats are all the same and the lyrics are wack compared to what they used to be."
3,Das EFX - Generation EFX,"A decent album buy Das EFX. Some of the tracks on here im feelin alot. Some on here I aint feel much at all. The same thing with the beats. A lot of the tracks sub and hit pretty hard so pretty straight beats. The lyrics are decent in some parts. But I heard some of there other sh** is iller so imma check that out. ""Dead Serious"" was really good. But if your a hiphop fan this album is worth it.My Top 5 Songs1.Shine2.Somebody Told Me3.Set It Off4.Rap Scholar5.What Goes Around"
2,Just couldn't get into it,"I found the story a bit slow for my taste. I really tried but I just couldn't get into it and never made it to the end. There are some formatting errors in Chapter Five that someone should fix - half the page is tabbed over a bit ( that isn't the reason for the review, however ), I just found the story draggy. I also found it kind of confusing when she talks as Catriona sometimes and Cat at other times. It is kind of jarring and I wasn't sure it was the same person at first."
3,too long,I usually don't read this style and size of romances. My main reason is that there is usually too much fluff and I end up skipping entire chapters. This book was one of them. I also can't say that that I laked the storyline that much either.
1,Might be ok read,I didn't get past first chapter. Too hard to get into storyline. Wish I would have got sample before purchasing. Maybe one day I will try again.
4,I really like it,No spoilers here. The character development is good and the relationship interesting :) The next book is just as good so I recomend you read it to learn the brothers story.
4,Charming the shrew.,I liked this book but it really is for younger readers. It is a serial of books and if I were younger I would buy the next one.
1,No spice,"Boring! I don't think I can say much more, but since I have to have so many words for my review I will say that I expected more."
4,NICE GREENHOUSE,"PROS:1.VERY ATTRACTIVE2.QUALITY MATERIALS3.FAIRLY EASY TO ASSEMBLE- READ AND FOLLOW INSTRUCTION EXACTLYCONS:1.LOW HEADROOM2.BOLTS BREAK EASILY...NO EXTRAS...SPECIALTY MADE BOLTS, HARD TO FIND AT HARDWARE STORES...IF NEED EXTRA BOLTS, YOU NEED TO ORDER FROM COMPANYWITH THAT SAID, I AM VERY PLEASED WITH FINISHED PRODUCT. I RAISED MY GREEN HOUSE USING 2 BY 6 TREATED LUMBER. THIS PROVIVES 6 IN. MORE HEADROOM. HELPFUL HINT - DO NOT TIGHTEN ANY BOLTS UNTIL ASSEMBLY IS FINISHED.....ALL IN ALL A GOOD LITTLE GREENHOUSE.FYI-- THIS SAME GREENHOUSE (EXCEPT FOR THE COLOR) SELLS FOR $200 LESS. IT IS CALLED THE RION SILVER HOBBY GREENHOUSE ...CHECK IT OUT ON THIS SITE."
5,Incredible Music,Ladislav Kyselak play viola on many of the songs on the album. Nothing else needs to be said. The greatest viola player of our time!!
5,Why SACD is so good,"As a longtime self-described audio nut, I have always been opposed to CD being the definitive medium for listening. Having worked in the audio retail business for quite some time, though, I am in a constant search for ""Killer Demo's."" I used a version of this on CD for a while, until I heard the SACD version. The image created was more lifelike than ever before, and far superior to the CD version I was using.This and Miles' definititve ""Kind of Blue"" SACD's are must-haves in the collection of any music lover. These units have driven me to purchase a Sony SACD player instead of a DVD-Audio machine. The difference is worth the somewhat heavy pricetag.SACD is the first thing I have ever heard that comes with the depth and soundstaging of a Sheffield UHRQ LP. Well worth every penny for these UHRQ discs.Do your ears a favor, buy the SACD machine. Get as many SACD's as you can. Its worth it."
5,Very classy watch,It is a very classy watch. It looks good and works perfectly. The leather band is high class. The container box is useful.
4,Gift was a hit in spite of delivery hitch.,"This watch was purchased as a Christmas gift for my father. He seemed to really like it when he opened it and put it on immediately. He was still talking about it 24 hours later. He is 84 and has arthritis in his hands from years of service with a public utility company. He doesn't have to wind this watch. And if he needs to change the time, the winding piece is a little larger and sticks out where Dad can get a good grip on it. Dad also wears his watch to bed. I am waiting to hear if he is enjoying the indiglo. There was a glitch in the original order so it was held up, then cancelled. No one at Amazon was able to tell me what the glitch was (ie did I enter incorrect information for mailing, billing, etc?). So, I placed the order again and prayed that the glitch didn't come up again. Even though the gift was a hit, I only gave 4 stars because of the last minute stress I endured. The order delivered just in time for Christmas."
1,Stop-watch,"Received this as a gift, like the styling, feels well made, but have had continual problems with it not keeping time."
4,Good Watch No Regrets,"I bought this watch because I did exstensive research on the brand ""Wenger"" online and got good results. The only minor problems I have with my watch is that it's 10 seconds ahead and the numbers don't really aluminate as much as the hands but that's nothing. It's nice and simple watch, no thick booklet manual like other watches. The crystal is nice and durable, I wear this watch at my job and no scratches yet. There have been complaints about the leather wrist band but I dont have any concidering I have the brown leather band on as we speak. Good Watch Good Investmnent"
2,What happend?,"Ground Control could have been awesome, but it falls flat onit's face. The version I purchased ... was a complete wash out. It was full of bugs and problems that any gamer does not want to hassle with. There were consist errors in the game itself and don't even try to do multiplayer, you will end up using a few choice words at the computer. Take my advice, buy The Sims, it is far better and full of no bugs. Maxis knows how to put a game together, Sierra does not! Don't let the graphics fool you, Ground Control has too many issues and does not allow for a clean game playing experience. Oh yeah and if you are really looking to buy it be warned, you can only control one side. There is no option to be the ""bad guys."" Most RTS's allow this. So there it is. Two thumbs down and all that jazz. Don't bother wasting the money or time. ..."
1,Disappointed with Ground Control.,"THis game is not as good as I anticipated from the reviews. The motion is choppy, control response is poor and my computer locks up during game play. I opened it and now I have to keep it. Keep away from this one."
2,Boooring,"I found this video dreadfully boring and the only people I can see enjoying it are those that are interested specifically in the Bustros family. I bought the video in order to get a better insight into what it must have been like to live in Beirut during the Civil War, but the majority of the content focuses on the family members, their childhood, their thoughts, etc, and this elite bourgeois family by far did not experience the war like the majority of the population must have. The film did, however, contain some fascinating video footage and amazing audio of distant gunfire and shelling, but only in limited short clips in between boring interviews."
3,"Not as good as ""Take It Like a Man""","Her previous effort ""Take It Like a Man"" is one of the funniest stand up act's I've ever seen. Unfortunately her new release ""Dirty Girl: No Protection"" is no where near as funny. It feels worn out, over played, & less of a stand up routine, but more of lets tell a bunch of the same short stories but change them up a bit. Sure there still some of the funny racial bits making fun of different audiance members, but it equals maybe 10 minutes of time on this effort.If you don't like crude racial humour, then you're not going to like Lisa Lampanelli period & should look for a different type comedian. If you've never seen one of Lisa's special's before buy the DVD of ""Take It Like A Man"", you'll laugh until you almost cry. This effort however, is worth no more than a rental & you shouldn't expect a whole lot of hysterical material.Buy ""Take It Like a Man"" instead & rent ""Dirty Girl: No Protection"" if you must see it."
1,Disappointment,"I expected much of the voice of Bros, but this album turned out to be disappointing. Strange, boring songs and a hoarse voice. What happened?!"
5,"Rich, mesmerising, exotic","An excellent taster of Arabic music from Yemen. The rhythms are propulsive, the melodic lines intricate and emotive, and the singing deeply spriritual. This is simply excellent music."
2,what a shame,"It's a real shame that the incredible MC5 documentary ""MC5: A True Testimonial"" is held up in litigation so that this far inferior DVD can come out first. The main feature is the reunion/tribute performance, which is limp and boring. A number of punk & post-punk bands have reunited lately to show that they can still kick ass, MC5 is not one of them. I really hope that ""A True Testimonial"" gets an official DVD release eventually. As anyone who's managed to see it in festivals etc. will attest, it's much more interesting & exciting and touces on some darker aspects of the bands compelling history. Come on guys, sort out the money crap and let the story be told! If you want to attract new fans to the music, Sonic Revolution wont do it."
1,Is Haddam a liberal?,"No plot, editing, pacing or excuse for this long boring liberal diatribe. The publisher should be ashamed."
5,"Been in my CD player ever since March 24, 1998","I can't say enough good things about it. My favorite album thus far and I would expect nothing less from Superdrag. With lyrics like, ""She, she looks so out of sight, what she's done tonight...this time I am alright.(Pine Away)"" to suttle references to rock greats like the Beatles, this is a must have. I was not disappointed, I was exstatic."
5,The greatest albim of all time,"I could listen to the album "" head trip in every key "" straight through for hours at a time . I t is my favorite album ."
3,This is not a Holy Grail,"As much as I love Superdrag, this album doesn't really have the ability to stick to me as Regretfully Yours did. Amphetamine is the best song off the album, capturing emotions not capable in the rest of the songs."
5,SIMPLY ONE OF THE BEST OF JON DAVIS'S CREATIONS!!!!!,"THE ALBUM IS AN AMAZING ADD ON TO ANY SUPERDRAG FAN'S CD COLLECTION. THE TITLE, ""HEADTRIP IN EVERY KEY"" IS THE ABSOLUTE TRUTH, ESPECIALLY IN THE SONG; DO THE VAMPIRE. SO BUY IT."
5,Exceptional.,"This album thouroughly impressed me. After hearing Regretfully Yours, I thought that would be it for them. But the zany tetrad from Knoxsville, TN came back with this out of sight album. The transition from conventional dark splintered guitars to thicker riffs with the dark horn rhythms, left me in awe. Thumbs up for me."
2,"got it, listened to it one time, collecting dust since","its too creative in a very sloppy way. the post production is as bad as the mixing, the tracks range from excellent to just ""ok"" and that B.S. ""dj kicks, the track"" is a joke. stacey, i've seen you spin up & down the east coast, i know what you are capable of. this isn't nearly your finest moment. this cd is slop and disappointing. try again. and try harder. a huge let down. the sequence of tracks go nowhere either. this thing was thrown together. its ..."
4,Very Impressed with this CD,"I was impressed with this band when I saw them live supporting The Corrs, so I bought the album. Now I am even more impressed, especially with Another Day Goes By. The overall sound reminds me of Wet Wet Wet and London Beat."
5,What a drive,"I've had this CD for about a year now and I found myself surfing to find out if this group has released another CD. Vibe obviously cannot recognize talent, originality and the ability to surpass the emptiness of the norm. This group has all the musicality of any boy group in their collective pinkies. They can rock, groove and swoon. And the fact that they're black makes this album even more important. It's refreshing to experience musicians making the kind of music they're obviously passionate about without succumbing to the demands of the pop culture. Track 6 ""If I can't Love You"" battles the beauty and sinceretity of Maxwell's ""Whatever, wherever, whenever."" These boys deserve to have a long and successful career. I just hope they continue to make more music. Raw vocals like this are not heard everyday. I wish them all the best for my sake - I want more"
5,Great!,"I am a history / world literature major, and I love this backpack. It looks just like Kagome's (especially after I cram all my books in there!). It is sturdy enough to handle all of my books, and that is saying something. If you are a fan of the show, and need a good backpack; then, go for it ~.*"
4,Review of items received,I ordered 10 packs of these radios for a total of 20 units. They were delivered earlier than stated which was fine. One unit had a problem which I don't know what to do to correct but it is a minor problem. I would do this again.
2,Better Can Better,Dienetiks required more quality for inner ejaculation.Guidelines of better FEMMES of ESTHER ROSE Evolution.Ninja Icarus can made site of illumination of Leaves Eyes behide the ZONE of ACTIVISION:
1,Became Erratic.,"Despite the fact that 14% of the reviews poo-pood the MX 610, I decided to take the risk and purchase one. It has an extremely nice feel and I thought that I was going enjoy using it and was glad I purchased it. Unfortunately, within 3 weeks of delivery, the mouse became erratic and inconsistent. It would skip 3 or 4 inches across the screen and was impossible to select a specified point or text. I returned the MX 610 immediately and Amazon immediately refunded the total purchase price. I wish that it had worked."
3,Good mouse but more choices to program buttons needed.,"I like the mouse overall but the choices for programming the buttons is somewhat limited. I need to have the second button or the right click button which in a lefthanded mouse is actually on the left. Anyway this button is NOT programmable. The only option is Right Click or you can swap the buttons. I need to be able to program this button to be a ""keystroke"" and that be ""Enter"" as this is very handy and helpful. In AutoCAD it is wonderful to be able to pick and hit return on the mouse by toggling or quickly picking between the two fingers. This is also handy in a lot of other programs so you don't have to double click so much that you get carpal tunnel or some other injury. I have informed Logitech about this but whether they fix it only time will tell. I sure hope so but I also doubt it but I am still hoping a bunch."
2,"I am left handed and this fits, but I was not too impressed","Well, it is a mouse for lefties....I don't use the huge software that has to be downloaded, becauseI don't need an email button on my mouse or a volume control.It has a lag time and uses CPU cycles.I run it on my second computer and it does the job ok.It is NO good for gaming!I thank Logitech for the design, but feel they could have offered more of their products for ""we of the Left"".I do use their excellent G3 gaming mouse for my main PC as it is ambidextrous."
1,Did not work,"Product did not work and wrote a review that item was defective. Customer service stepped up and immediately responded by phone and email on how to return the item. Got my money back in less than a week. So, item sucks, but customer service is excellent!"
3,Left Handed Mouse Finally,Good Product.... Does get some interference from time to time. Double the cost of a right handed mouse. Left Hand descrimination...
2,Good Attempt...poor mouse,"I've been looking for a quality left handed mouse for a while. I've been using my Logitech Mx Laser w/ Bluetooth for a while. (that is a great mouse) I was very dissappointed with the MX610. For starters its not Bluetooth compatable like my keyboard other peripherals, so it takes up one of my 2 USB ports. Secondly, the thing skips seemingly loses it's signal and thats with transmitter 3 feet away!. I got so frustrated that i switched back to my old mouse. It did feel very good,(now i know how the righties felt all this time), but that doesn't really matter if it doesn't function properly."
5,Great Tip,"This tip works really well. I can't recommend this brand highly enough. I have tried several woodburning tools (Dremel and others), but this is by far the best. I used it to burn in lettering on my walking staff. Worked really well."
2,The Laughing Corpse,"This book just didn't do it for me. I won't spoil it for anyone else. It is very different from the other books in this series. If you have listened to the older books on audio, then you will understand I hate this narrator."
5,Glad I found you!,It took me a long time to find this series that started 20 years ago but so glad that Laurell created Anita and that fans helped keep her alive so she is here for me now and still evolving! What a fantastic world of characters!! Thank you for sharing them Laurell!!
1,A waste of precious reading time,"I picked up this, thinking that it was going to be at least half as decent as everyone said it is. I was bitterly disappointed. Not only is the style of Hamilton's writing irritating and medicore, it is horrible. I found all of Hamilton's characters annoying and fake, besides that she had way to many ""main"" characters.The storyline was awful and did not flow well. A complete and total waste of time. Read something else. ANYTHING else!! This is terrible.Thank you!~Atalanta"
4,Who would've thought that animation is a dangerous.,"If you are an animator who refused a request of a very rich and a very nasty man, you are in trouble. Now, if you also manage to cross a Voo Doo priestess and a master vampire your life can become downright unpleasant. And with a murderous zombie on the loose... Sometimes it doesn't pay to be nice"
4,More good bloody fun,"So... what would you do for a million dollars? Anita ""just says no"" to human sacrifice, but not everyone has her scruples. This second book in the series carries on in the same vein as the first, continuing her slide toward what she considers ""moral ambiguity"" and we call ""steamy love scenes"". Plus the title is just plain cool."
4,"Not the Best, but....","Though some say that Laurell K. Hamilton has mediocre writing skills and such, I don't believe that's necessarily true. Hamilton's writing is witty, and full of small idiosyncrasies that relate to the writing style and the character build of all Anita Blake and Co.The Laughing Corpse was good, though I haven't read Guilty Pleasures, The Lunatic Cafe, The Killing Dance, Obsidian Butterfly or Narcissus in Chains, my favorites are Burnt Offerings and Blue Moon.Hamilton mixes character, emotion, and realism in all of her books, definetly worth reading."
3,"Good, but not what I expected","I thought this book would be mostly about me! Instead, I had to wade through stories and advice about child rearing to get to the few parts that were actually about the mother. It seemed more like this was the 7 Seven Stages of Child Development. If I wanted to read books about how to deal with my child at each age, I would've gotten a different book. All of this is helpful but it just wasn't what I thought the book would be about."
4,Ex-Massive Attack-singer rocks on DJ-job,"I loved Nicolette her work with Massive Attack, and I LOVED this DJ-album. It's not anything like, by example, a Laurent Garnier-mix, but it's also really great. She's using a lot of different styles. There's a lot of sort of hardcore-music in there, but I like things that are different, so... The Nicolette-tracks are also great, especially ""A Single Ring""."
3,Hard to remove,Item as described but it is very hard to place and remove blower from the rack do to bad design.
2,This isn't the movie,"But a promo. For a five minute promo about the movie, it's a good one, but that's all it is."
2,Not the movie,This is a short incmplete behind the scenes film. Doesn't really contain much information. Not something you need to pay for or own to enjoy the movie.
5,Wonderful. Interesting. Well done!,Fascinating... Loved it! Great background material well presented. Made an already great story even more interesting. Highly recommend to anyone.
1,The King's Speech: Road to the Throne,worthless 5 minutes preview-deceptive marketing.you make up 15 more words!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!akakaakakKkKkKk/ alalala alalala wowowor alala. wowwodr/alaalrwowords
1,RIP OFF THIS IS A FIVE MINUTE PREVIEW,I am disgusted with Amazon. I settle down thinking there was finally a quality movie I could watch. THEY ARE FAR AND FEW BETWEEN AMAZON!!! Then I get a 5 minute preview. Total RIP OFF. I SO MUCH WANTED TO SEE THE MOVIE
3,I wanted to watch this movie.,I was loking forward to watching this movie but did not get around to it before it expired. I will have to rent again or maybe just buy it since I have heard it is really good.
1,Waste of time,"I wanted to see the movie, and that's what I thought I was purchasing access to. This is crap I don't care about."
2,An Ok yarn,Not a bad yarn. Interesting premise. Some of the plot paths stretch the imagination of the reader (and reality) a bit. Reasonably fast paced. Not bad for late night or airplane reading.
3,no changes yet,"I suffer from CFS and Fibromyalgia, I haven't seen any change or progress... yet?!... I been taking it for 3 weeks, I will give it a little more time..."
3,For a friend....,"A friend wanted this.....said it was ok, but he didn't order it again....try everything once, I guess. Anyway, a good buy."
5,Well Done!,An extraordinary and surprising retelling of Camelot from Mordred's point of view. I was completely surprised and charmed and am now hunting more from this author.
4,Enjoyable,"Sometimes the plot devices in this novel require a suspension of disbelief, but by and large, this book is highly entertaining. The main characters are well drawn and fun to read about, and the secondary characters are just as real. Anytime a book can make me laugh out loud, the writer has done her job well, and the suspense holds until the very end.Highly recommended."
1,Yuck :-(,"I wish I had tried these B4 purchasing an entire case. These were awful! I threw the rest of them out. There were so tough to chew, it hurt my teeth! I buy many of this type of product (trying to find alternatives to ""granola bars"")... this is the worst one I've ever tried."
1,Crappy Stained glass coloring,Should have known better I did have one of these but didn't put together that the company only had one type of coloring book- Markers or painting. I work in pencils. All the stained glass ones are useless to me unless I can convert to paper works. L.Lowes
4,Basinger plays a corpse plus many twists more - good entertainment,"Kim Basinger has the role of a very attractive spoilt brat (with a Ferrari) in this entertaining made for TV movie. It offers many twists up to the surprise ending and a couple of very good performances. Robert Culp seems to enjoy his role very much, he ominously stares into binoculars and crawls out of bushes with an insane grin at odd moments. All very hush hush. Equally good is Nancy Marchand a the possessive mother of one of the main characters and the attractive and little seen Ann Dusenberry (Cutter's Way) as one of the many ""diversions"". The title of this review contains a spoiler - sorry - but should not detain anyone from watching and enjoying this little entertainment of a movie."
3,Milk chocolate coated pecan caramel,"Unfortunately the taste is off, compared to what I have had before. A little hard to pin down what may be causing that."
5,Very good Watch,"This is a Beautiful watch, with a amazing funtions, is also very strong and resistant."
2,Wow - Service Sticker Shock!!!,"I received by watch about 3 years ago. Paid about 500 for it. I was very pleased with it and the funcitionality until I sent it in for service. The thermometer was stuck at 99 degrees and as such figured it was time for service. I sent it to the location listed on their website and got the estimate back. Wow, what a shock. It was between $200 and $300 for service. Given that the watch was about 500 I find the service amount to be ridiculous. I have a Tag, Sector and various other high end watches. Never have I had to pay that much for service and the Tag is a $2,000 dollar watch!!! Needless to say I will not be having the watch serviced nor will I be buying a Tissot again."
3,Not quite Happy,"I have conflicting thoughts on this item. It didn't fit in my lighter because it stuck out too far for my gear shift, so I had to put inside my center console outlet leaving the cord hanging out. Luckily it is very powerful and the signal makes it to my radio fine through the closed console.The major downside, is I do not have many available fm channels so I get interference, hissing and sometimes a morse code sound.It is very simple to use, and I will continue using it until I can get a hard wired stereo."
3,"it may just be my car stereo, but...","i have tried using this with my ipod...and it is a disapppointment...i have sirius, which is reasonably clear, am and fm, which are fine, and a cd player...but this is just weak and inadequate no matter what fm station it is tuned to...i guess it could be a deficiency in my car stereo...but i can't say i am impressed by it..."
2,Not for iPhones,"Although the manufacturer says on their website that this transmitter plays iPhone music, mine didn't. I tried everything they suggest and more. Was able to have it working with a regular iPod, but it only charges my iPhone. Nothing else. The accessory recognition message didn't ever popup. It doesn't matter what I do and how many times I plug/unplug it.Plus, their support is terrible. It took a week to have my questions answered stupidly."
3,Static,"This item worked perfectly with my older vehicle which had an analog stereo system. With my new vehicle that has a digital reciever, it was difficult to find a station that the radio was not receiving a signal. When I did find a station on my new radio, it wasn't available for long, anytime I drove 5-10 miles I had to change the frequency on the DLO Transmitter."
2,rare dud from techno master,"Fans of harder techno may like this energetic mix cd, but fans of Craig may be disappointed. From a man known for his electicism and sophisticated style, this cd is surprisingly uniform and ""banging."" Look instead towards Craig's excellent compilation cds: the elegant ""Designer Music"" and the more get-down ""All Access."" Both of these are lots of fun for enthusiasts and the uninitiated alike."
2,Yuck,"I received this product a few days ago and started giving it to my cat. My cat will not touch the stuff!!!! So, I can not tell you if the product works or not. I will keep trying to get my cat to eat the supplement and if she does, I'll write another review.Okay, I'm back a few weeks later and my cat has started eating this product. I haven't seen a difference as of yet, but I will come back to write another review when I see results. My cat has lost it's hair on one of her ears so, I will see if the product will help grow her hair back."
5,it does a kitty's body good!,"my kittens like this - they don't rave about it. however, i am supremely impressed with how they look and act since they have been eating this. given that it is 100+ weather here, mixing this supplement with their food allows me to be able to sneak lots of water into their food as well. i slip and give them a more than directed, but i have had nothing but pleasure with it."
4,"Great Durability, but a few thing should be noted","posted 3/28/06 by Jack [bawkbawkboo1]This is an old-style, yet long-losting scanner. It has a resolution of 600x600 DPI max, or at least that is what it says when you click on its properties. Thats about 163 KB for one image [it can be adjusted downwards]. Works best if you have Microsoft Office-as this program comes with a sub-program for scanning and viewing scanned images. I do not know about Apple's approach to this, or if this scanner is even compatible with Apple computers. It is no longer available at any retailer. It has three buttons: scan, scan+print [effectivly copy], and scan+e-mail. The latter works best with Microsoft office, again. It has just two port: power in and USB out. It comes with a USB scanner to USB computer cable I believe, but only USB [the smaller one with four prongs on the bottom]."
4,Good flow and very relaxing,"I have been doing yoga/pilates dvd's for a few years now and so I have a basic understanding of certain poses, which I recommend for those who are interested in this DVD. While she does explain the poses, it is brief and expected for you to follow her voice as she flows through (rather than glancing up at the tv screen for guidance). Her voice is extremely soothing and her english accent is comforting. My favorite part is the end where she describes the relaxation process. This video also includes a few balancing poses that I could not master, but with a few tries I'm sure I'll get there. I recommend this video for those with a basic understanding of Yoga/Pilates and those that are slightly flexible."
5,Avery business cards,"I went to our local office supply store to purchase business cards. They wanted $20 for a package, but had a special offer of $30 for two packages. I almost bought two packs, but thought ""I'll never use all of these."" I put them down and went home to see what Amazon offered. This pack of business cards cost about $10 -- and produced lovely business cards.To separate the cards with clean edges, just follow the instructions. Bend the cards at the seams back and forth one time. Works like a charm"
4,I think it works.,I think it works. Not really sure. The only reason I left a star off is because it tastes horrible. Wish it were in capsules.
5,This product works,"My husband had a bacterial infection in his intestines and after antibiotics, he lost the ability to digest food properly. Mega-Zyme helped his food to digest and he feels great now."
1,Ick! Please do not give Mark Falanga any of your money!,"Please do not buy this book. The author is a smug, self-important guy who thinks he is funny. As a recent transplant from Chicago to a northern suburb, I looked forward to this book and was so diappointed. The stories hardly have to do with living in the suburbs (deciding on a religion for you kids?!, fighting for a parking space at the gym?). Please..... This is an insulting piece of dribble from a man who wants to weave into his story how much money he makes, what kind of cars he drives, and how hot his wife is. Don't waste your time."
1,"SO very, very very bad","This should be a lesson to everyone about how not to write a book. Mr. Falanga is pompous, idiotic, and mysogynistic. But worse than anything else, he is not funny(He certainly thinks he is though)!If you took away all of Seinfeld's wit and instead gave him a loaded sense of self importance, and then, in addition, had him brag about his amazing life for any number of innumerable pages you would have this book. If you like that, give the book a try.Seriously...I want the four hours of my life back."
5,That Girl Season 5,"I can't wait for the release of this last season!! The clothes Marlo Thomas wore along with makeup and hairstyle made her a trendsetter in so many ways back in the 70's. The character's of Donald and Ann are refreshing! It's nice to remember a relationship based on respect and love. NO ""hanky panky"" !! I only wish we still had such great writers and plots in today's television!!!"
2,This author is no McCullough-- Disappointing,"After having spent months reading Colleen McCullough's engrossing series on Rome, and being a lifelong lover of all things Roman, I thought this book was a sure thing when I picked it up. Alas, it is a dud. Very little happens in its pages. It has moments of good storytelling, but it drags in such a way that I am convinced that the author was hired on by the publisher to stretch his novel idea into three or four books. The characterization is not bad, but the plot moves at a snail's pace and when I was done I felt like I had not gotten my money's worth. Not a good feeling. I didn't feel like I read the same book that was blurbed on the cover. If a person wants to read gripping novels of Rome, one has to turn no farther than Colleen McCullough. Iggulden uses the same characters, but they are two-dimensional, predictable, and sophomoric. A poor effort. Either go to the library and get it for free or don't bother."
4,Butchered history; so what?,"OK, so the author does play fast and loose with Roman history and 'poetic licence' is certainly stretched to great lengths in his delivery of this series of books. So what; how many readers are picking up this book for an authentic history of Ceaser's life & times. This is historical fiction.... hello! Understand this and I doubt you will find a better example of this genre.I venture to suggest that the majority of Iggulden's readers know exactly where he is coming from & will not be disappointed at all by this series.You want to read a more factual (but still highly entertaining history, we have Seutonius for that! You want historical fiction, look no further. This is well written, compelling characters, a great yarn and just a damn good read!"
4,Caesar's early years,"The first few pages have a flavour of pulp about them, which soon disappears as the style becomes more fluid and one gets drawn into this strangely addictive book.The author has taken some licence with timing and facts (which he reveals in his end notes) to facilitate the telling of the story, but this is essentially a plausible re-telling of the early years of Julius Caesar and his best pal Brutus.Action, intrigue and political scheming are interspersed with some romantic interludes and an insight into the Roman mentality.Good enough to make me hanker for the next volume. ****"
1,embarrassing,I am usually entertained by any competant historical fiction of ancient Rome. This book is shot full of holes in the plotline and in the complete disregard of the known facts in its presentation of Rome and the characters who are purported to be its heroes. Iggulden should have changed the names and the places and presented his tale as fantasy. I put the book down forever after 150 pages.
2,"A fun read, but not historical fiction","This should definitely be classified under alternative historical fiction--not regular historical fiction.It's a fun read, but there's very little history involved here. If you want to learn about the history of Rome's big players, this is a very poor choice. If you already know about the history of Rome and want to read a generally fictionalized alternative universe about its main players around the time of Caesar, then this may be fine for you.I realize that all novelists, even those of historical fiction, are free to embellish for the purposes of creating a good story, and that it's not a history book per se, but this went too far over the line for my expectations.I recommend the Colleen McCullough series on Rome as well as Robert Harris' novel of the same era, Imperium. I also liked the biography, Augustus, by Anthony Everitt."
1,butchered history,"It's a shame how grossly inaccurate this novel is. I realize historical fiction bends the truth, but this was just plain horrible. Even worse, people will read this and think that it's true because they don't know any better."
2,"Decent writing, total disregard of historical facts","Although the writing style of this author is mildly entertaining, I simply could not overcome the fact that Iggulden consciously disregards the historical circumstances of Caesar's early life. Honestly, the only things that were accurate were the names the author used, and he even chooses to alter Caesar's familial relationships. For the average reader who just wants to read a good story, I suppose this book will suffice. However, if you're any student of history at all, you'll find yourself appalled at the author's blatant disregard for the facts. This book is ALL fiction, no history."
2,Disappointment with history,"I like to read historical fiction especially that covering the classical world. Therefore, I immediately picked up a copy of Emperor: The Gates of Rome. It is the story of the young Julius Caesar and Marcus, destined to be great Romans. While the story of two young Roman boys had some appeal, I was disappointed by the lack of historicity in both the details of Julius' life and background and in the depiction of Roman culture and society. As only two examples, in this book Marius is Julius' uncle through his mother Aurelia and a Roman magistrate walks through the Forum attended by a single lictor carrying the fasces with an ax and the magistrate is said to have instant power of life or death over Roman citizens. While historical facts are often modified in historical fiction for the sake of the story or for simplicity, rarely are they so fully overthrown. For a fictional story of the young Julius, Colleen McCullough's Masters of Rome series is much better done."
3,"Good Writing, Poor History","Although this book hit the shelves at a very good time, with a resurgence in interest in ancient history generally and Rome in particular, this is not a book to get if you wish to actually learn about history. It is an excellent example of character-driven writing -- these are living, breathing, fully defined people who go through challenging and at times horrendous experiences, all very realistically.However, this Caesar is not the real Caesar. This Marius, who dies in a street fight, is not the real Marius, who died of old age. Mithridates is definitely not Mithridates the Great, who would have demolished this Caesar's puny force in a day's work. The list could go on and on, and the later books only back up the impression that Iggulden gathered a bunch of names, figured out who lived at roughly the same time, and decided to rewrite history to fit his characters.So, highly recommended for character and writing, highly discouraged for accuracy in historical fiction."
4,Corn & crossbows in early Rome ?,"I really injoyed this book. A good read !! BUT... corn (a new world crop) & crossbows ( not due to arrive for several hundred years from China) was a severe irritant that did distract and annoy. I managed . What really frosted me was when I phoned the publisher to pass this info to the author so he wouldn't overlook these errors in the next volume of the series, the editor failed to even return the call , say thank you or even acknowledge recieving the info. I hope this fine author gets a better editor in the future."
3,A great book for the beginner chef only,"I really wanted to add a James Beard book to my collection of cookbooks and this one always got great reviews. It does have some excellent recipes, mostly classical dishes and some old world classics like Moussaka and Hungarian Goulash. It explains the techniques very well. Where I was dissappointed was in the number of recipes; there are too many variations and too few unique recipes. Also, some of the recipes are very very basic, such as omelette making or a London Broil. I would have liked some more interesting cuisine. Still, I am keeping it as it is a good reference book with some standard classical dishes in one volume: Pot au Feu, Yorkshire Pudding, Goulash."
5,Clear and straightforward,"Everyone ought to have at least one cookbook that covers basic recipes for just about anything you may have to cook. And this is the one I recommend. You can be staring at a cut of meat, or a fish fillet. Or wondering what cheese and wine to serve with fresh fruit. Or trying to guess how to make a cheese fondue. Or a pie for dessert. This is the book that will help you do it all. The recipes are not particularly fancy, nor are they exotic, but they're safe."
1,Information in here suspect at best,"The information in this book cannot be trusted to be accurate. For example, the write-up on Bryn Mawr claims that students there call themselves ""Bryn Mawrians,"" when in fact Bryn Mawr students refer to themselves as ""Mawrtyrs."" Such evidence of sloppy research makes me wonder from where the writers get their information - and what else is just plain wrong.As an independent educational consultant, I advise my students to do their own research into a college - and to avoid sources such as this one."
5,Awesome Gaming Mic,Clips onto regular sized headphones and is very easy to adjust. The cord is 1000 feet long but I use this on a desktop computer and so its not a big deal good voice quality and voice pickup range.
1,Very quiet with a lot of static,"The mic picks up sounds all right and stays securely clipped to my headphones' wire, but there's loud and horrible static in the background of any voice recordings I make with it. It's not so bad it makes what I say unhearable, so it's technically usable, but sounds pretty terrible."
1,Horrible for Skype,"This microphone was awesome for the first month, but then it got too loud, picked up too much external noise. It was impossible to use during skype calls, and I tested it for a few months. Thought it was just skype, but overall it's just bad. I'd return it if I could."
2,It is a mic. It records noises.,"Ok, so, yes, I know this thing is cheap, but it sounds awful. I cannot recommend it at all. It does set up and function as advertised, it's incredibly easy to use and comes with enough wire to rewire a full PA system, but it sounds like trash. It picks up sounds only about 4-6"" from the aperture and is so fiercely directional that it's nearly useless. If this mic were used on a boom, as with a headset, it would be fine. But, attached to a cable on a headphone or a lapel, it is an exercise in frustration.Beyond the mic's insistence to be placed inside the speaker's mouth for optimal pickup, the sound quality is ""poor"" at best and ""wholly unacceptable"" at worst. I've tweaked every setting imaginable to get it to work acceptably but no dice.I would return it, but honestly, it's not worth the hassle for $10."
4,Decent mic,"I use this mic mostly for VOIP while gaming online with friends. The quality is fine none of my friends complain that it sounds bad or that they cannot hear me. The only reason that I knocked a star off is because the clips are way to big for every headset or pair of ear buds I own. I read in another review that you can twist the cable for a tighter fit and that has worked, but still it's a little annoying. For $10 it's a good alternative to many ""gaming"" class headsets and I overall I like this product and would buy it again."
4,Great for the price,"I needed a new mic for my pc, but I didn't want to get a gaming headset since I already have a good pair of headphones. These are great for the price and clip on right to the headphone cord.Only downside is that the clip might not attach to certain headphone cords depending on thickness."
2,Weak Audio,We were trying to use this on a PC. Even with a mic boost in the audio control panel this unit has very low audio and is basically unusable for our purposes.
4,Bought for pc mic,"The mic seems to be of good quality and the cord is long - very long.I can't comment on sound as it turns out it was not my mic that was bad, but the computer."
1,CHEAP,"If you like throwing money away on cheap crap that will last a week, buy this.I would not buy this for 99c, sound quality is trash."
4,"Works great, very thin cable","Everyone tells me I sound crystal clear. My only concern is that the cable is too thin, I expect it to break at any time (I guess it comes with the cheap price)."
1,Bad Quality Mic,This is a bad quality microphone. It is nowhere near the quality of even a weak $10 headset that you can pickup at wal mart.
1,Broken in a month,"First I though this thing will clip but no it is just a hole and there is no clip so it kept falling off wherever I put it. The input to the computer is very sensitive/broken. I have to fix it 10 times in one conversation and every fix takes like 1 minute, 10 mins of conversation is gone. All and all it is a piece of crap. dont buy"
4,Good enough for me.,"I use this exclusively for talking to friends while playing videogames. The quality is fine for that, but people who record for videos or podcasts or other demanding tasks obviously want something else.Pros:-Cheap.-Small.-Good sound quality for a clip-on.-Works with most headphones.Cons:-Picks up EVERYTHING.-It's messy (cable is too long/there aren't enough hooks to hold the mic/headphone cables closely together).-The clip doesn't work on headphones that have thick cords.I'm pretty satisfied with it, although the messiness is sort of bothersome. I'm currently considering shortening the cable and using rings of shrink tubing to hold it snugly against my headphone cable."
1,Cushion?? I think not unless it's for a child.,"The name on this item should be ""pillow"". It is much too small for a cushion. They need to change the discription to pillow or cushion for your head. I wish I had spent more time reading the whole page on this item before I ordered it. Lesson learned!"
1,Great Stuff but........,This set of Ed Sullivan - Beatles ---- Lasts about 3 plays and the disks go bad. They are apparently made of garbage DVD's. Error Codes and'skipping sections' --- bad. I have not had this on any other DVD's I play - and I have hundreds.
3,"Gives good points on villains, but leaves fiends too weak...","This book treats fiends mostly as average intelligence monsters with little in the way of ""supernatural"" powers. It is a pale shadow of the original 'fiends' presented in the 1st Ed. AD&D game. Since it is designed for the Ravenloft setting, many of the powers and abilities are difficult to translate into another setting. The limitations built into the creatures' make-up are part of the Ravenloft setting too -- again, it makes it difficult to translate it into another game setting. If you are looking for insights into the netherworld, this isn't it! If you are a Ravenloft fan, buy it if you must, but there are better resources available."
2,bracelet,"When i purchased this along with the matching necklace, the company sent me an email saying that they had a tarnished bracelet and they wouldn't send it to me so i had the option to wait for a new one or to cancel the order. So i chose to wait and to be honest they sent it right away and gave me back the shipping money. But the bracelet is not as shiny as the necklace at all. It's as if it's made of stainless steel not silver plated. I don't know if this is the tarnished bracelet they were talking about in their email because i have nothing to compare it to except the necklace. It's not like the picture."
3,The recipes from the Betsy-Tacy books,"My favorite Maud Hart Lovelace book is Betsy's Wedding and I was very happy to find a recipe for Lady Baltimore Cake. I don't think that I will be making any of these recipes and I am not sure it was worth ten dollars but it's nice to know that pre-gadgetry, cakes were being churned out; that eases my baking anxiety."
4,happy DeLonghi customer,"This is my second DeLonghi toaster oven. The first one still works just fine, but I wanted also a bigger one, so now I am using both. I still have to get used to the controls of the new one though, therefore I am only giving it a 4 star rating at this point. The first one I bought at least 10 years ago, never had a problem with it, while the cheaper ovens I had before never lasted more than 3 - 4 years. To me it is well worth spending the extra money and have a reliable product. I use the oven a lot, primarily for baking, seldom for toasting. I did some extensive research before I bought this new one and I think it paid off. DeLonghi for me is the only one."
2,overly complicated and slow,"too complicated, requires 3 steps every time you want to make toast and always reverts to its presets which are too dark"
3,Not for babies.,more like a documentary. even with animated fish. buy for kids science project instead.
3,Good game,I wish there were more levels!!! I had the game beat within two hours. The graphics are great but it just isn't LONG ENOUGH!
1,Ehh,"I was bummed to see most of the cute, modern scarves were knitting patterns which is no good for me because I crochet. Also, it seems that the scarvces don't come out quite right unless you use the exact same yarn as described."
2,Heard It Done Before,"First and foremost the production on this CD is fantastic, right up their with NIN's The Fragile. But like The Fragile, the music/songs do not go anywhere. It seems as though Jon Crosby is holding himself back lyrically and musically; too bad really because he appears to have tremendous talent that is unfocused. The vocals are derivative/reminiscent of Jim Morrison/Bono and the samples are the same ones heard on records by Enigma(I'm Dying)/The God Machine(Touched). The music and rhythms heard on this album are the same ones WE have all heard before.The cello on ""Flames"" is the only redeeming musical statement on this album."
5,One of the more interesting albums I've heard in ages.,"This album somehow got into my MP3 collection. (don't worry i bought the CD). I never listened to it, and I was going through my play list and accidently started ""pretty when you cry"" right during the chorus. It grabbed me. So I listened to the entire thing-- wow. This album is excellent, I've got about 500 CDs and this is the best CD I've bought since downward spiral. I have the greatest emotional reaction to ""you"", so I'm going to have to say that it's my favorite song. I can't wait for more from this guy, hopefully he'll do well."
4,Satisfying yet lacking.,"I really enjoyed the haunting quality of this disk. It seemed to spin webs of floating chords right out of my speakers. . .Considering I only listened to it on the advice of a friend, I was hooked. I'd buy more like it in an instant--and can hardly wait for his next albumn. For those of you who are reading this before buying it, consider the disk a mix of Enya and NIN with a dark twist. Trust me, you'll enjoy it!"
3,"powerful, fizzles.","When I first heard this album, I was blown away by the production - the multi-tiered aural assault, drawing on many different musical influences (as already catalogued by previous reviewers). The first several songs I thought were amazing, the sound grabbed me immediately by the throat and shook me around. (You MUST play this CD loud!) But as the songs paraded past, I realized how front-loaded (creatively) the album seems, I really think it runs out of gas toward the end, whatever gas it is that makes the beginning of the album so utterly powerful and compelling. I also thought that the lyrics fell far behind the music, in terms of originality and depth and strength. Still, a one-of-a-kind musical experience, you need to listen to it - you must have a friend you can borrow it from occasionally - ?"
2,It is a good copy of work that has been done.,"I first heard their music on the radio and listening to their tracks I think they do a good job of imitating a band called Dead Can Dance who first developed this sound and made it their signiture. Vast attempts to mimic their DCD's use of instruments, but they falter at the end."
4,Quite Outstanding,"Initially I wasn't too impressed with this album. However, as I listened to it a few more times it started to grow on me. Then I listened some more and it continued to grow on me. Now I have trouble putting it away. The melodies are extremely catchy and addictive. There is so much raw emotion contained within these songs. I wouldn't say it is similar to Nine Inch Nails like many of the reviewers here say. Firstly it is far mellower than NIN and there's only a slight electronic influence. It reminds me more of the Tea Party. Jon Crosby has a great singing voice and plenty of musical talent considering he wrote all of the music and played most of it too. It's very atmospheric, moody and dark yet melodic and accessable. It's not an agressive album but it is very powerful. A great debut."
2,Gets damaged too easily,"We really liked this brush - the bristles are just right, not too hard or too soft. It's also a good size. However, after washing it with warm water just a few times, the coating on it has started to peel - which I think is a hazard for small children. The brush also cracked - I don't know if that's also from washing (like other reviewers have said) or because my toddler has thrown it on the floor a couple of times. Either way, I think it should be of better quality - any item meant for a toddler should be made to last after being thrown."
4,Very Good,"Don't let the suspiciously low price steer you away from this. It's a good little CD. The two classic radio shows are funny (including the ""Who's on First?"" bit) and the sound quality is surprisingly outstanding. If you're a fan of Abbott and Costello, you could do worse than give this a try."
5,"Kevin is the ""GREATEST""","I HAVE LISTENED TO KEVIN SHARP EVER SINCE HE FIRST CAME OUT. I THINK HE IS ABSOLUTLEY THE GREATEST! HE SINGS FROM THE HEART,WITH EXPERIENCE. UNLIKE ALOT OF OTHER ARTIST. ""GOD BLESS YA KEV"" YOU DESERVE MILLIONS! KATHY KELLEY OREGON"
4,"Fun, nostalgia for grandparents","I like this cd for my 13 month old son, but it makes his grandparents even happier. A good overall choice."
1,"Bogus, bogus, bogus.","This book is a travesty. The author regurgitates some of the more tediously obvious elements of Jung and elementary ritual magic, and presumes to call the twaddle which emerges 'alchemy'. If you want to know something about alchemy, steer well clear of this rancid exploitation of the Great Work, about which the author knows absolutely nothing."
5,Is it me? Or are harsh criticisms and negativity the telltale signs of a mind lacking illumination?,"This book has gems to offer, just as any book written by a person well studied in these subjects does. I found this book to be a lovely addition to my alchemical library, it's rare that I find a work that echoes suspicions I have long been harboring, and this is a fascinating synthesis of several subjects in which I am interested. I find his language to be familiar and accessible after much study of the older alchemical manuscripts, and Dr Goddard provides straight forward techniques that produce results for the focused mind. I recommend this book, so consider it and intuit it's usefulness for yourself.Speaking of a lost art.. :-)"
3,"Good basic introduction to BioMag, but somewhat bias","Knowing little about BioMagnetism, the book was a great introduction to the subject. Very easy for anyone to follow, and a good overview in general. However, the writers of the book own Magnetizer BioMagnetic products, and use the book to promote their product in every chapter. Also, they use the book to promote other products which are questionably unrelated. But all in all, I did learn a lot."
4,"Great, but just a start","Although this contains their top 4 singles, it leaves the listener wanting to hear more. Amazingly enough, while Men At Work only produced 3 albums, there are about a half-dozen really good ones available. How can that be now?"
1,Incredibly useless for what it is...,"You'd think they couldn't mess up something this simple. When I plugged it in, I got no power light. After fiddling with the power button for about 2 minutes,the light did come on, but the start button stayed pushed-in. This made it impossible to open the lid. The eject and stop buttons did absolutely nothing. I had to try my best to pry it open since I had a tape in there. I have no idea why it behaved like that but I have heard from others afterwards that it is a common problem. The company must have saved a bundle in engineering this product."
1,"Lack of science, lots of snake oil","Question: Where are the results of the peer-reviewed, randomized, controlled, double-blind studies?Answer: There aren't any!!This book is the equivalent of getting the cart before the horse. If it's so effective, then let's have the scientific evidence that shows its efficacy. Most books written by psychologists are written on the basis of the result of years of scientific research that use accepted research methods. This book is written on the ""promise"" of studies that might be done ""someday"" and nothing but excuses for why there are yet to be any proper studies. Sorry, but I don't have time or money to waste on ""promises"" as there are many, many promises that never come to fruition. At this point, this promise isn't science. It's snake oil. The funniest part is a pilot study would be sooooo simple to conduct, which would then either make way for more research or lay the matter to rest, if only there were a scientist in the room!"
3,Books looks very good - will read it soon,I promise to write a review once I have had the time to read the book.Kind regardsLisbeth Pedersen
5,Life of the Beloved,"Henri Nouwen says, ""the greatest trap in our life is not success, popularity or power, but self-rejection"". In his book, he discusses our Belovedness by God. A powerful and life-changing idea!"
5,Best coffee,We love this coffee. Our favorite so far. Used to drink another but they quit making it! Will drink this from now on!
2,A poor outline on the mathematics of business,"This book is too elementary for college students needing to know finite mathematics, which usually refers to the mathematics related to operations management specifically and finance in general. Also, it contains some theoretical material on set theory and the equation of a line that seem to be out of place. There is also some material on geometry that doesn't really belong. Instead, I suggest the older out-of-print ""Schaum's Outline of Finite Mathematics"" published in 1994 by the same author. That book covers a more appropriate set of mathematical topics geared towards the student of finance. Also, there are not the numerous errors in that older outline that seem to plague this book."
2,Don't burn at 16x,"I've burned hundreds of DVDs, and bought Ridata several times. But, these always fail at 16x using Nero. I made about 5 coasters before I changed the speed to 12x. They burn at 12x fine. I expected more from Ridata\Ritek. This set is not worth buying if you want to burn at 16x."
2,20 out of 100 bad...,"I go through about 100 DVD-R discs every two months. I've not found any brand that is perfect and my latest purchase were these RIDATA discs. My system was built by me 1 year ago and has the ""latest and greatest"", and I've not had such a poor experience with other brands, so I'm not suspecting a hardware problem could be causing me to have so many failed writes. I'm ending up with 1 out of 5 that will be used on a solar project I'm working on. These have about the worst record of any brand I've bought. Granted, a 100 disc purchase isn't enough to conduct a scientifically valid sampling, but having tossed 20 out of 100 I won't be buying them again."
3,Not compatible with my burner,"I wasn't sure how to rate this, so I just wanted to leave a review and make it know that it is not compatible with the sony dru800a. 8x Ritek does fine, but these are not at al compatible. if you dont know whether they are with yours, please research it first, or every disc will be a coaster. Tried it at 2x, 4x, 6x, 8x, and 16x."
1,Not very reliable media,"My Liton 16x drive does not like this brand of media. I get coasters at least 50% of the time no matter what speed. From other posts I have seen, this media does not work well in some drives. Unless you know it works in your DVD burner, I would not recommend buying Ridata/Ritek media."
2,not for me,"these disc only burned at 4x on my desktop, which is a dell running windows xp media edition. and only 2x on my laptop. but they did do great in my friend's laptop at 8x and when she used her external burner, they did burn at 16x. so while they are not for me, they do work. she has all of them now, so for the price it is worth seeing if they will work good for you."
1,SEAGAL DEFINITELY DISSAPOINTED ME WITH THIS ONE,"AN FBI AGENT [STEVEN SEAGAL] GOES UP AGAINST MERCENARIES WHO'VE CAME INTO ALCATRAZ TO GET THE SECRET LOCATION OF SOME STOLEN GOLD THAT WAS STOLEN BY A THIEF WHO'S ABOUT TO BE EXECUTED. THIS BOTTOM OF THE BARREL SEAGAL MOVIE IS DEFINITELY HARD TO WATCH. AND ADDING JA RULE AND KURUPT TO THE CAST DEFINITELY DOESN'T HELP IMPROVE THE SITUATION. ALL OF THE ACTION IS BORING, THE SCRIPT IS POORLY DONE, AND LET'S FACE IT, ANY MOVIE THAT HAS SEAGAL WORKING ALONGSIDE JA RULE IS ALMOST GAURANTEED TO BE A BAD MOVIE. THIS MOVIE MAKES ''ON DEADLY GROUND'' LOOK LIKE ''UNDER SIEGE'' IN COMPARISON. THIS IS STRICTLY FOR THE DIEHARD SEAGAL FANS."
5,"One of Steven Seagal best, Must see.",I enjoyed this movie very much have seen it more than 8 times.I sorry to say that I don't know the name of woman that plays number 2but sorry to say I have not seen her in any other movies.I though she was great and should continue making marial arts movies.
5,Half Past Dead,"What an excellent movie to decide to buy than this one here. Have wanted this Steven Seagal movie for over 5 years and got it. Movies from Amazon come in great condition, great selection, and at great prices, for most of their movies. Highly recommend this movie to any Seagal movie fan."
1,Don't Bother!,"If i could give this movie 0 stars i would. Sadly i went to see this in the movies, and i wanted to get up an walk out, and that was the vibe i was getting from everyone else in the theatre. Seagal hardly fights in this, Ja Rule is one the worst rapper turned actors i've seen, the fight scenes are sloppy and look thrown together. The whole premise to the movie is [bad], and tired. As i said before, don't bother."
5,war and killing,we let the jap savages off the hook at the end of the war ...in doing so we dishonored our own dead soldiers...what were we thinking of ..
2,Must be knowledgable about subject first!,"I gave this book two stars only because it is obviously crammed with lots of information about the topic. I ordered it, however, because I have a curiosity about this subject and wanted to learn more about it. This book had a lot of great reviews so I purchased it. I understand nothing about it. Even the terminology is beyond me. I was looking for something that explained from a starting point on how to create and read charts. This is like taking a person with no experience or exposure to medicine who is interested in becoming a doctor and throwing them into the OR doing neurosurgery! It might come in handy later down the road when I actually know what Quincunx is (and if you don't then look for another book too!) but for now I'm going to have to order another more simplified edition over the subject."
3,Active noise cancellation,"Let me start by saying that I love both of these bands on their own. Sunn O))) with their deep, rumbling drones and Boris with their in the red, over the top rock (along with their earlier work which I prefer) each stand strong alone but when mixed they almost seem to cancel each other out.I found this album to be extremely underwhelming. After reading the Pitchfork review I thought they were full of it as usual. The more I listen though, the more I have to agree. There were high hopes for this project and I feel that it just didn't live up to the hype.Instead of buying this, go get 'Heavy Rocks' and 'Black One'. Play them both at the same time if you like. I think the results might just be better than this album."
1,Driver is a poor sport & takes baseball too seriously.,"That's what this sticker says to me. Relax, it's just a bunch a multi-millionaire guys playing a game with a ball & stick so that they & the multi-millionaire owners, network- & advertising executives can make some bucks. Also, it's not like the old days of baseball when players stayed on the same team year after year.But if you do take baseball very seriously, how about taking the high road of sportsmanship & buying a sticker such as ""Orioles Rock"" or whatever your team is."
2,Only in 2 channel stereo and to much talking & interviews,"Wow, she has to travel and stay in hotels. Never would have guessed that."
4,"Not As Good As ""Britney Spears : Live And More""","Genie gets her wish is a movie about the talented CHRISTINA AGUILERA, but with this video it puts her back in Britney's shadow. Genie gets her wish is cheaply made it goes back and forth and the picture is blurry and not as crisp as Britney's far suprior dvd's. My advice for all you POP fans get Britney's dvd's and wait for a 2nd Aguilera video.CHRISTINA AGUILERA GENIE GETS HER WISH: C-"
3,Too academic,"This is a collection of academic papers read at a conference at Brown university in 1987. While the speakers are obviously experts in their field, the problem with the book is that it wasn't written as a book but rather as simply a collection of papers, and there was very little (if any) attempt to transition between a paper and a book. What makes a good paper doesn't necessarily make a good book. Hence, the choice point is whether or not you are looking for a book or a collection of papers.Looking at the papers themselves, they are spotty. Most have the academic digressions that we look for in graduate papers, and it can take pages before someone is able to get to the topic.Despite these negative comments, there are indeed pearls hidden among the academic trapings and I found the book interesting and informative."
3,Too big!,"After much research, I chose this seat only to have it be too large for my skinny boy's bum. I wish I would have gone with the Baby Bjorn seat as I had originally intended. This one is too big to be usable. Granted, my son is small and he's starting early.I gave three stars because it's easy to clean, I like that the top pops off to fit on an adult toilet, and it seems decently made. The splash guard is basically useless though. It gets knocked off really easily and it just seems to get in the way."
1,Completely out of Date,"Avoid this book at all costs. You'll see many people who give it four or five stars say, sure it may be out of date but it's still a great resource. It is not a good resource at all This book is so out of date that the transliterations are incompatible with modern Egyptological practices and understand. He gives no references to where the ""definitions"" came from and the definitions he gives are often incorrect. If you really want a hieroglyph dictionary then get Faulkner'sConcise Dictionary of Middle Egyptian."
2,Buyer Beware!,"This two book set has some merits as an extensive base of heiroglyphic information. It is put together in a fairly easy to use format. HOWEVER!Please be wary that this is the second half of the complete book. The first volume, or the first half of the dictionary, is not available for purchase. Before you think of purchasing this title, be sure that you have found the first volume, otherwise the back half is more than useless. I purchased this thinking I would easily find the first half, but was proved wrong.Due to the outdated nature of this material, I recommend you find a more contemporary dictionary of Ancient Egyptian that is in its entirety."
5,Want a babe for fun & life!,"Based on the information in this book and some other books, I found my wife. Before we were married...I used the information in this book to fool around with over 5 women.My former lover handed my things to me in a pillow case and said, ""Goodbye."" I was stunned. I got dumped. Instead of crying, I am single. I went home and dug out my books and proceeded to read about love, lovers, women, and SEX!The mistress book had a great impact. I got back into shape and checked out the scene. Within 30 days, I had five lovers. This period is before AIDS.This book is NOT a magic pill but correctly applied...you can have more lovers."
2,Wonderful for a while,It worked great for almost a year ..then it ruined 3 tapes and I got rid of it. I felt this was going to happen right from the start as it goes very fast and then snaps still at the end. Buy it if you don't mind the it might break after 6 months or so.
2,Crappy,"This product is really crappy. The first one I received, it didn't work. I had to put the book over to run and it wasn't run properly. It had squeaky sound which could damage the tapes dramatically. I had to call them (Amazon people) to send me another one b/c the first one was malfunction (was a defective product). The second one is fine but let's wait how long will it last b/c the product is ""MADE IN CHINA."""
2,I didn't think it was that bad until the end...,"It ended too suddenly; there's not even a ""what happened to everyone"" epilogue as in the other miniseries finalies. And what's with the GW and the artist? Can they not decide what these girls look like? Cinnamon now has coal-black hair? Most of the girls' characters are pretty blah, with the exception of Cinnamon. There's the gratuitous near-rape scene, and an almost-incest scene (the GW usually finds a way to make sure the participants aren't blood-related). It did keep me reading until the end, and then it was just...over. All in all, another disappointing effort. When will I learn?"
2,What is happening here?,"Ok I have been getting more and more discouraged with everything that the ghost writers have been putting out. I didn't like the beginning of the book. It picked up more around page 100 and got a little better.They changed everyone but Honey (who in my opinion needed to be changed the most). Pretty much, they go to the school, big secrets, getting taken advantage of because the girl is naive. The normal stuff that has been going on since the cutler series, only not as good."
4,Christmas: Rhythms of the holy land,I like this one just a lot harder to dance to it is slower songs. It is more of the religions music.
2,Keep listening to the CD,"I'm a big Christopher Cross fan and was hopeful to find this recent live concert to take advantage of the full sound that DVD can bring.I was greatly dissapointed at the quality of the audio -- no seperation of instruments; no where near CD quality sound; poor 5.1 audio.His performance left something to be desired too -- the camara angles where dull; his commentary in between songs was un-interesting and full of low self-esteem for what he refered to as his ""five minutes of fame"" career.I guess I had hoped for something more along the lines of the quality found on the Kenny Loggins or James Taylor DVDs (both of which I would highly recommend) -- especially since this was performed within the last three years.I got the impression that this DVD concert was released to promote his web site that he gave out (at least 4 different times throughout the concert) and to play some tunes off his poorest selling CDs to try and get more sales."
5,It was STP but 100 times better.,Scott has never sang better. His music was very deversified and had a lot of feeling. I listened to it for hours and I felt that he put a lot of thought into thre writing of his lyrics.
4,Experimental pop?,"I'm not sure what to call it. Most people either lovedor hated this cd. It just happened to grow on me over theyears...If you enjoyed STP's 3rd cd and like Bowie(the 70'sstuff), THe Beatles, maybe even a little Pet Sounds from TheBeach Boys- with niche for electronica and experimentation-well you've come to the right place. Obviously- if you arelooking for Core-era STP well... you'll hate it. 12 Bar Blues is like the better part of 60's acid/fuzz rock mixed with electronica/pop. I also like the fact that Scott Weiland is playing alot of the instrumentation on here. But definetly his best instrument is his own voice. I think the thing that makes this cd a gem is the treatment of vocal harmonies which claim once in for all that this isn't some Eddie Vedder clone.(Which I thought was totally unfair to begin with.) Fave Tracks: ""Desperation #5"", ""About Nothing"", ""The Date"", and ""Jimmy Was A stimulator""."
2,Doesn't make the grade,"I generally like everything Scott does and I really tried hard to like this record, but it just didn't inspire me very much. The Barbarella song was a bit of a high point, but overrall this record would be what resulted if a tornado went through a junkyard. Sure something great could come from the chaos, but after all the sound and the fury this alblum kind of falls flat"
5,SCOTT WEILAND ROCKS,"I like this CD and being a fan of the Stone temple pilots and a huge fan of Scotts voice and lyrics I expected a lot. I think Scott's delivered a lot and he shows that he has a lot of talent in writing music as well. He is experimenting with a lot of different things, different instruments and music styles and it isn't very similar to the work of STP. If you're not just into STP and similar music you'll love this one but don't expect it to sound like the STP."
3,What Do You Want on Your Pizza?,"Cute, fun book. The illustrations are bright & colorful. This book is interactive for young readers; however the pizza topping puzzle pieces that fit into the pages are not interchangable from page to page. It is frustrating for young children and they may require adult help to put the pieces on the correct pages. This book has pieces that could possibly be swallowed by very young children."
3,Okay,"I think that Marc Cohn's first album, ""Marc Cohn"", was just amazing. His work will always be bench marked against it and that is a hard goal to achieve. Even a mediorce Marc Cohn album, is better than most of the popular albums today. When his first album came out, I saw him open for Crosby, Stills and Nash at the Universal Ampitheatre. David Crosby introduced him as ""the real deal"" and that's what he is. His work is what he feels. This album is worth buying just for the few tracks that move you."
4,"Many different styles, but good","The first time I listened to this album, I was very excited about some of the songs (Ellis Island, Girl of Mysterious Sorrow), and not so excited about some of the others (Already Home, Olana). Compared to ""The Rainy Season,"" I was a little disappointed. However, after listening to it several times, I realized that the main problem -- if you want to call it that -- with the album is that there are many different styles represented in the songs, styles that shift abruptly between tracks.I still don't think that this album is as good as ""The Rainy Season;"" however, I like it more now than when I first started listening to it, and there are certainly some real gems here."
2,Pretty weak compared to his first CD...,"Most of the material on this CD, his third, is not really inspiring or very original.Healing Hands is a pretty good track.But compared to his first CD titled simply 'Marc Cohn', which was EXCELLENT, this is just not as good.And his second CD, don't bother.It's the usual story - an artist spends 20 years creating their first hit CD and then they're under pressure to produce the subsequent CDs in a year or two. It's a tough business.Cohn reminds me of Bruce Hornsby (in style) who had 2 good initial albums but has weakened since then."
4,All on a Sleepy Night,"I live in the same town as author , librarian Shutta Crum. Having experienced first hand ,her story time presentations, I knew that when this book came out, that I just had to have it for my three year old granddaughter.We were not disappointed!The sounds of the night that keep the little boy awake are demystified and made musical by Crum's use of rhyme and onomatopoeia.The illustrations add a comforting effect and encourage discussion of the various contributors of the nightly noises. No furnace monsters here...just loving warmth.It's a fun read aloud story!"
4,Good book for those not in the know,"I thought this was a very good book - but for people who really have no, or very little knowledge about taking care of their heart. It gives very good info on how the heart works, different procedures, and exercise. Diet is also included with recipes"
5,"Damn good.............damn, damn good.","Hey, Jeremy here in California. Just got your CD, and I tell you, not too bad, all my friends like it and they think you guys should come over to the west side to play a few shows."
5,A Bunch of Laughs,"This book had me laughing to the end, a bizare world Grover Goldstein lives.Chapter 14 was my favorite I would read this again.Im so glad a stubbled upon Bizarro Fiction."
3,Leo,This movie was interesting but I certainly would not give a better rating than okay. It had a good storyline that's all I can say.
4,Learn Latvian CD,"The product is fine as far as it goes, but a little too narrow in scope. The CD is very easy to use, contrary to another customer's complaint he could not load the CD. There must have been some defect in his equipment or understanding.Charles Cherry, Sarasota"
5,Spicy Book!,"I love books that bend my perspective. Gabriela is such a juicy, vibrant protagonist. And the book is written so poetically. Just reading it will make you feel more alive!"
4,Exotic and untranslatable,"In Portuguese this book is funny and sentimental. In English it becomes absurdly exotic, LEARN PORTUGUESE AND READ IT PROPERLY"
1,Beware,"Just a note: Beware of this egotistical, self-promoting ""guru"". Read him if you must but with a jaundice eye. He can open ideas for you, IF you don't just swallow every word as gospel, by creating a platform for questioning your own path. But do NOT follow him blindly. Think about where he is coming from, who is writing and what is the purpose. Mostly to sell books, give lectures, appear on TV I would guess. There is very little of The Silence in him and that, in my opinion, is where the answers lie. Meditation is the way to delve into your spirit and let It guide you by grace. It will."
1,"Not ""Last Hope"" from PA - not even close","Buyer beware. This is not the talented band from PA. Although still a punk band this is not the band that has produced an album called ""Violence, Vengeance and Retribution."" Two totally different bands. I would not recommend this one."
3,The best info about buying or selling cemetery property is available online as a downloadable ebook..,If you want to buy/sell cemetery property I suggest that you check [...] and place a free listing. You would also be wise to check on [...] and get the ebook; it's the only book I know of that is still in print and explains the process of buying and selling (and re-selling) all types of cemetery property. It is available as a download so you can get it instantly.
1,THIS BOOK CONTAINS ERRORS,I took the HSPT Diagnostic Quiz to ascertain the difficulty of this test. I was appalled to find 4 errors in the answer key and 1 error in a test question. How confusing this must be for a child using this book!
2,Kaplan Falls Short on this Book,The HSPT practice tests are written horribly and typos abound in the test questions as well as the answer keys. I would not reccommend this book for test preparation. ARCO writes way better books than Kaplan in this category.
5,Educational and Entertaining,"The Goal gives you an important understanding of business and is a great reading experience. This book is about Goldratt's theory of constraints (TOC), and puts the theory into a interesting story. The story goes on with essential questions and answers. Alex Rogo, a fictional plant manager and the main character of this book, solves plenty of problems in his plant by trial and error. Readers can learn the idea of the TOC by following the thought process with Mr. Rogo. Regardless of whether you are a plant manager or not, I recommend you read this book."
2,Potential for the right audience,"I am not in manufacturing/assembly line work. I read this book looking for ideas for day to day management.My first comment is the book is too long. The material could have been covered in 50 pages. Goldratt adds material that I did not find interesting and I found myself wanting to jump to the next ""meaty"" part of the book.If I was in manufacturing, I may have a different view of the book. Otherwise, the valuable information is too far apart to recommend this book."
2,Definitive?,"I picked up this book and started to read the first substantive page, Page 10. The very first paragraph states: ""Hawthorne is situated in rural southeastern Alachia County very close to the boundary of Putnam County."" Of course Hawthorne, California is, and always has been, located in the western part of Los Angeles County, near the Los Angeles International Airport. Further, there is no Alachia County nor Putnam County in California. If the book starts out with such a glaring error, is the rest of the book filled with other pieces of misinformation not so easily identified?"
2,Concert Dates,"I had the privilege to see the Beach Boys three times in concert (Summer of 1965 Rochester NY Auditorium Theatre, Summer of 74 at the Toronto CNE with opening act BTO and finally in 1978 (I believe in June w/ opening act Doobie Brothers) at the Rochester NY Community War Memorial. Unfortunately none of these dates are listed in the book. Was I really there or did I just dream it?"
5,This is an excellent video!,"Hi, I've been studying belly dance with Mara for two years. Her video is really good, both for the beginner, or for the intermediate dancer who really wants to break down and refine the core 12 belly dance moves that Mara explains in her video. I've bought this video for four of my friends, most of whom have never studied belly dance, and they've found it to be a great introduction to this dance form. I've seen other belly dance videos, and Mara's is much more clear, concise, and easy to follow. Check it out. :-)"
5,The only way to kill flying pests!,"Great product, works well with mosquitos and gnats! Used it about every 4 days and works to keep the pests away. Can't say I ever saw them drop from the sky dead but I know they didn't land on me seeking blood!"
4,For the Ryans,"Being a lover of all things Irish, I found this book at a county fair and decided to give it a read.Let's give Ann Millholland credit for putting the book together as a tribute to the family who gave her a sense of place in this world. It's a difficult matter, the death of a husband on whom her life depended. With that loss 1/2 of her identity seems to have floundered and the other 1/2 went in search of her roots.I didn't feel there was a lot of heavy lifting in this book, in the metaphorical sense of finding herself. But to have found the love of a family is enough and she writes of the family's life in rural Connemara and the bus, now long forgotten, that served the community.My very best to you Ann. A hearty endeavor."
2,save your money,"I purchased this a year ago. The software leaves much to be desired. It has not ever been able to scan. Originally, I had a pentium 3 with excessive memory. The hp tecs said it did not work because I was memory deficient. I have since purchased a mac os 10.3. I called hp twice before purchase to confirm that they supported this operating system and they reassured me that they did. Guess what? Won't scan. Everything that this thing needs to do, needs to be done from the printer, not the hp director except print documents. It also pulls through multiple sheets and prints on all and is noisy. Pick something else!"
2,"Hard to ""Digest""","Hammer's is a very advanced grammar book NOT intended for anyone with less than university English grammar knowledge.A great extent of the examples encompassed within the book are solely in German with no interpretation in English. And that is a major flaw. Some of the explanations can be quite confusing and unintelligible so beware. Furthermore, one should take into consideration that that it serves the function of reference, excluding practice. Therefore, it is insufficient for students in need of practice. In the overall, not very useful for freshmen students."
4,Mel Street: A Country Legend,"I grew up in the area that Mel Street lived in. I was not into country music when Mel was alive and a star. Now that I am older I wanted to see what he was all about. I really enjoyed the book because lots of the ground he walked on, I did also."
4,Of Historical Interest,This video is very good for those interested in WW2 history and the analyst on how this battle was conducted.
2,Unreliable Phone System,"Purchased this product when we signed up with Vonage. The system worked great for a while then suddenly the base unit quit working. Since I'm out of US and thought it would be too hard to go through customer service I purchased another of the very same system. Now after 4 months of use the very same problem has occurred. On my own I isolated the problem to the power supply since the base works using another similar power supply, at least I can still use the phone.I have yet to use the customer service but overall very unreliable system."
1,Vonage phone bad,"Bought my first Vonage phone 12 months ago. 6 months later it didn't have any power. Because the warranty was out of date, I bought a new one. 5 months later the second modem went dead. Again, I was unable to get the modem to power up. Do not buy this phone. Try to find another option."
1,Vonage system,"Failed within 1 month. Needs a new power source I think, to make it work properly. Is it the plug or something in the box?"
3,Outdated,"This is a good calculator, but it's way outdated, about twenty years. You would be much better off getting the original TI-Nspire, which should be around $60. The keys on this one are hard to press without getting other keys, and they don't always register. The menus are complicated, and although it works well, it has too much hassle for me to enjoy using it."
4,Inspiration for Christian Pilots,This is a spiritually inspiring and encouraging book especially for Christians who have any background in flying. My father was a pilot for over 60 years and my mother also had her pilot's license. They really appreciated this book.
2,Disappointed,"I ordered this book as a Christmas gift, and I was rather disappointed when I received it. The cover art is not well done and the graphical look and quality of the whole book looks rather cheap. I have not read the actual content so I have no comment/judgement about that.... but as for the aesthetic value I would have to vote thumbs down. I hesitate to use this as a gift now."
3,what'd you expect?,"I watched this film because the DVD case boasts that it won awards at five film festivals, but that only proves that the experts can be badly wrong. Set in 1984 Palermo, Angela is bored at her husband Saro's shoe store, so she takes a more active role in the real family business, which is running drugs by stuffing them into the shoes inside the boxes. Angela is something of a trophy wife for the older mafioso Saro, and you know it's a very bad idea when the younger Masino, a confidant of Saro, starts to hit on her. What was he thinking? In a mafia movie? In prison Saro dumps Angela and promises, ""your prince charming is a walking corpse."" We never see Masino again, nor does Angela. I tired at watching unshaven men with unbuttoned shirts and pinky rings talk tough in darkened rooms, and failed to find anything very interesting in this movie. In Italian with English subtitles."
2,This mouse has some problems.,This is an okay mouse. But here are the problems:1) The email and im buttons only work with a few software products. I use Thunderbird and the email button doesn't work.2) I've had the mouse for 4 months and am already on my third set of batteries! This mouse does not save you battery power.3) It's become very 'figity' lately - jumping around on the screen sometimes and very sensitive to double clicks.4) The SetPoint software from Logitech is buggy. Each time I start my PC it tells me that I need to reinstall SetPoint (which I have no to no avail).
3,Wireless mice aren't there yet,"Like anyone who is skilled with a mouse and uses it at high speed, like gamers, I have always stayed away from wireless mice. However after several years I thought that it was worth trying one of Logitech's top of the range laser cordless mice to see how things are. The performance is much, much improved but still not quite there. The mouse has a great build and shape, fine laser tracker, but the lag and extra weight ruin everything. You can get almost ANY cheap optical wired mouse that will out-perform this."
1,VERY Cheap USB Receiver - broke,"After less than 1 year of use, the small USB Mini-Receiver broke and now the mouse is ruined. I will have to order a replacement and I'm sure with shipping it won't be cheap. Battery life was good because of the ""smart"" technology, but no matter how 'smart' the thing is, I still need a working receiver! And the quality of that little piece is horrible, it always wobbled.. and now it is non-functioning. Logitech made a good mouse, but paired it with an unreasonably cheap Mini-USB Receiver."
1,Garbage with pretty LED's,"If you're a gamer or a graphic designer, look elsewhere. The power saving function of the mouse makes it shut off until it feels motion. So if you're not using the mouse for just a little bit, it powers down and waits for movement.It's a very ergonomic mouse, with responsive buttons and nice LED indicators, but if it can't let you move around the screen when you need it to it's not much more than a (bad) paperweight. Move along."
3,Great some times very unpredictable.,"The looks and the usage are very easy and comfortable to use. lots of feature and some of them are very handy. One particular feature is, it lets you customize the scrolling feature for each indiviual application. this works great with most standard applications.The negative side, the precesion is not much different to the regular one i had before. one more thing is some time it the cursor moving speed is unpredictable, it either moves too slow or moves too fast.In all this is ok... but i would give a try to some other too.."
4,The Truth,"Enemies of America, domestic, first of all, never had any arguments to begin with.Here this lady doen't leave ""stone upon stone"" of any of their ""ideas""."
1,She Does No Credit To Conservatism,"Coulter is a spiteful, hateful and coarse woman. She comes off like she either was spoiled rotten by daddy or otherwise tortured mercilessly by high school.A overwhelmingly cynical and negative presence that anybody sane -left or right, Democrat or Republican- would avoid."
2,Next?,"This book would have been more appropriately titled ""How to Talk to a Liberal (If the Dog Ate Your Homework and you Don't Want People to Know You Are Stupid."" It is just sad that somebody who claims to have everything figured out must rely so heavily on ""how-to"" books for having an informed discussion with whomever regarding politics."
1,HOW TO TALK TO ANN COULTER (IF YOU MUST),"I cant stand Coulter, but bought the book to see if shes still the evil little poison pen for the right wing media machine, and guess what? She is still is. Still nasty, still evil, still gross. If it were not for the GOP book clubs this book would not be high up on the Amazon list, as it is. The GOP tells members to buy these books even if they are crap, so it looks like a good read, and it might recruit some poor soul into their web of deception. I read the book half way through, then i got a rush of diarrhea, and could take it no more. I wish i could get my money back. You still make people sick Ann, the GOP is glad to have you. And they can keep you."
2,Just her columns,"I'm a big Ann Coulter fan and hard core right winger. Ann is awesome, witty, funny and hot too! But sadly all this is is a collection of her columns arranged in chronological and subject order. It would be good for liberals to read to help cure the disease of liberalism, but for me I was somewhat disappointed in that there was nothing new. All of her columns are available at her web site and I have already read them so there was nothing new in this book for me."
1,The Paris Hilton of the (sic)Right,"She really is the typical hypocritical [...] that I expected her to be. Bashing Liberals is a fun sport, because some of us deserve it,and some of her remarks are hilarious, but when she equates US soldiers to bottom-feeding dregs of society that deserve to be in Iraq, Her true evil colors are showing!She would be well served to remember that this same regime that she supports has an agenda for women,one that she doesnt quite fit into!Can you say ""re-education camps""?"
1,Who are the imbeciles...,"Who are the imbeciles who are actually buying this book and thereby funding the vomitous tripe that this poor excuse for a human being spews forth from her rancid, poisonous maw? It is not about truth or lies, it is simply about a woman who is either so full of herself or her ""witticisms"" that she employs neither a filter nor any scrutiny of her informaton. Ann Coulter is absolutely (regardless of how well-written or entertaining her prose may be) the single most odious, repugnant, and unchristian squawk-box on either side of the political spectrum. My advice is for everyone to stop enabling her by refusing to purchase anything from which she may profit."
4,A Drink of Water in the Desert,"Humor writing has almost disappeared in the US. Apparently everyone is afraid they might laugh at something they are not supposed to. Thank God for Ann Coulter. 80% of the reason I subscribe to ""Human Events"" is to read Ann every week. She is not a humor writer per se but her take on the passing scene is not just right on but laugh out loud funny. This of course means she must be silenced by the Free Speech and Diversity crowd. The left hasn't gotten any smarter in the last 40 years, just read the mindless reviews on this site if you doubt that. There is no IQ test for entry into the Church of Liberalism. Their thinking is, ""She has different ideas from us; she must be stopped!"" This book is classic Ann and worth reading for her ideas and her comic flair."
2,Mainly a compilation,"I've always liked to read Ann Coulter's columns on her website, anncoulter.com. However, I am not sure that I need to read them more than once.This book is about 92% old material with about 4 or 5 brief new essays. I wish there was more new articles, especially since it has been well over a year since her last book was published (Treason), so it is not that she didn't have the time."
1,Ignorance Prejudice and fear walk hand in hand.,"My God was this one sided and clearly showed that an angry fearful, non-open minded woman wrote this. Just like another reviewer stated I put her along with Michel Moore. So set in their ways that they wont listen to reason. Look a true conservative would admit mistakes and state that the other side has some good thought. For example Pat Buchanan Book ""what went wrong with the right"" is a perfect example. Pat (was conservative before conservative was cool) was man/woman enough to admit mistakes. Ann buy a mirror and keep telling yourself you are the best, save us the time and I recommend to read Pats book and get the conservatives back on track!"
1,50/50,"Some of her arguments are valid, but she's a hilariously bad writer. She mostly came off sounding shrewish and hysterical--not exactly worthwhile. I understand and agree with some of her points... but how did she ever manage to sell a book with the way she presents them? Oh, that's right. She's a six foot blonde bombshell and law grad, so people think it's ""worthy"" literature. Trust me, it's not. Never judge a book by its cover (or its cover girl). There are better presentations of the same arguments out there; I implore you not to devote your time or resources to this book. I promise, you've better things to do."
1,"Sorry Neocons, I disagree with mAnn Coulter","This book is nothing but full of immature hatred and boring rants. To my belief, 'how to talk to a neocon (if you must)', free-thinking people will have to bring a sledge hammer or welding torch to make them (neocons) understand.Not recommended to buy, that book is a big joke but it is useful to use as a substitute for toilet paper in 1-star public restrooms (by the way, I am grateful for that).This book is perfect for people who depends on emotions, not logic or common sense."
1,A few select Ann Coulter quotes,"Here are some of my favorite Ann Coulter quotes that only proves the point that she knows nothing about politics and is a hack job just to make conservatives feel better about their views.""Liberals hate America""""Liberals hate all religion except Islam""""Democrats actually hate working class people""""Liberals hate society""""Even Islamic terrorists don't hate America like liberals do""Democrats will destroy anyone who stands in their way. All that matters to them is power""""Liberals can't just come out and say they want to take more of our money, kill babies, and discriminate on the basis of race""""liberals seek to destroy sexual differentiation in order to destroy morality""""That's the whole point of being a liberal: to feel superior to people with less money""""Liberals are crazy""Don't expect any of these quotes to make any sense at all. They were all written by Ann Coulter."
2,A slap or a hug?,"I don't know if I want to hug her or slap her. Slap her for being such an evil, chain smoking nazi, or hug her for the awful childhood she must have endured as evidenced by the hateful drivel that she espouses. Which should I do Ann?Either way, this woman needs a long vacation, a permanent slot on the therapy couch, and a nice medication adjustment."
1,A book with a whole lot of nothing in it.,"Fire is the only use I can find for this garbage.Until Ann gains some intelligence we wont have any shortage of it.Can Ann make a single paragraph without the use of the word ""Liberals""?Knowledge is undoubtedly something she lacks since this book has no real points.Books like these are meant to be entertainment for the ignorant.Unlike others of her age Ann's behaviour is really immature and unprofessional.She is very narrow minded and conciders all against Bush to be idiots.Hence all she does is argue like a child calling everyone ""Liberals""."
2,why?,"does ann coulter really think shes right about all of this? that conservatives are 110% correct and right when liberals are wrong about every thing? im somewhat in between...some what of an independant, but if your not an idiot, you would see both parties are both 50% right...both parties are made up off of opinions, i just so happen to be a wee bit more on the liberal side. she was payed 25,000 dollars to come and talk in my town, which i think is ridiculous. thats more than most adults i know make in a year. if your coming to a place to speak your mind freely, and try and change peoples opinions, why the hell would you be payed 25 grand! i am in an athiest agnostic open minded group...were just not open minded enough to like this lady.i must admit she is a good writter though.but a horrible person."
1,Child Killer,"She's a harpie, a liar, a thief, and a mass murderer of police, soldiers, and children. Anyone who buys this book, or sells it, is helping the NRA murder more children and police. She's also helping the Bush traitors lie to and kill our soldiers in Iraq, our heroes. And the unconscionable comments she's made about the 911 widows....The list of atrocities goes on. DON'T BUY THIS BOOK!"
1,Propganda for the uninformed,"You always know when the conservatives are wrong because they focus their attention on trying to tear down the other side like Ms Coulter does in this book instead of their own pathetic, self-serving record. Don't waste your time on this vacuous ninny's work."
3,Ann you are such a babe! But this book sucks...,"[...] I guess that's worth one star. The other two stars are for this book. I love reading Ann Coulter and I love listening to her talk. I wish she had her own talk-radio show. She is So funny and SO over the wall that if only 10% of what she says is true, then OMG! The trouble is -- probably closer to 50-75% of what she says is true. This book is just a collection of her past columns. They may seem prophetic em masse, but, to me, they are a disappointment. Very little of the book is new material. ""Treason"" was a far surperior read."
1,terrible,"Nothing is learned from this book except that Ann Coulter likes to complain. Americans should stop reading partisan trash like this, nothing is learned or gained, we only create more slander to be thrown about.Read about US History or talk with your friends and have a real debate, nothing about this book is usefull, it wont even burn properly."
5,My favorite book,"I would give this book more than five stars if I could.What Ann does is combine whit, humor and the cold hard truth into one entertaining straight to the point book. I would much rather give my money to Ann for her book than to Michael Moore for one of his ""movies.""Ann hits the nail on the head with everything and says what I have been saying for years now. If this book gets bad reviews, it's because liberals are the ones reviewing this wonderful book because they have nothing better to do than find one more thing to try and use against Republicans."
4,"Great Book, with a warning though- Reprinted Material","This is an awesome book, worth the wait, if you are a fan of Ms Coulter. It is however, mostly reprinted material that you can get online. There is new commentary, and most of her columns have been expanded as she was able add the portions that her editer(s) originally cut from each article.That said, there is not a stinker in the book, each article is wonderful, totally Ann.You can tell how good this book is by the reaction of the digital brownshirts that have mobilized en masse (very sheeplike) against this book - Of course without reading a page of it...This book is worth the price!Thank you Ms. Coulter!"
3,Halfway there,"Halfway through the reviews. And I decided I would buy the book. Probably because it gets either 1 star or 5 stars by the reviewers. I would rather you have read the book before commenting. It seems like her idea of ""truth"" does hurt. I have seen her on TV and found her to have a sense of humor. I would like to see her bent on multi-culturism. Give it up bad reviewers. I saw Franken on TV also and he was funny. It's just when you mix them in the poltiical milkshake that it seems to taste like brewers yeast. See the movie ""What the Bleep"" for the reason she stands firm on a decision. I will read and re comment."
2,I am a moderate...,"I am a moderate. Both extremist conservatives and liberals fail to see the truth through their views sometimes, but I know very successful and productive people who are fundamentalist conservative and socialist liberals, whom I love. I am a fan of John Stossels work, and I like Sean Hannity most times, and I also like Ariana Huffington, and other liberal books.Here is what I think:Bad:1. The book is not well written.2. It is the right side equivalent of Micheal Moore: Trashy insults and playing on fear and paranoia and extremism3. Some of the stuff she says is not logical... or practical, and it makes the religious right seem crazy...Good:It is good for a laugh... in a very low brow pathetic way. I did laugh at some stuff... sometimes it was just because it was THAT pathetic... and other times it was because I thought she made a witty statement.I wouldn't read it again. And actually take some pity on those who take her words to be serious"
1,Both Liberals AND Conservatives Should Hate This Garbage...,"In writing her newest book Ann apparently didn't have much time for writing, so she regurgitated a bunch of her old material instead. This greedy meglomaniac is a great self-promoter who shamefully uses her access to the media to spew hateful and devisive rhetoric intended to offend liberals, but that also would embarrass any educated or otherwise literate conservative.Written with the intellect and mean spirit of a retarded sociopath, Ann labors on with her ""liberals are satan-worshipping traitors who want the UN to come to your house to steal your guns and force your children into gay marriage with Osama"" rhetoric.I wish people would realize that this and all the other Fox ""News"", Limbaugh, Savage, etc. is little more than sensationalist corporate marketing. Wake up."
5,Unbelievably funny and acurate! - A must read,"Ann Coulter has done it again. This book gives such insight into the misguided minds of the liberals in this country. By using facts as well as humor this book is a joy to read. It is frightening what hypocrites Democrats and liberals are.Ann Coulter is a true patriot, one who ""gets it"". She has done extensive research for this book. Instead of just offering hatred and lies as the liberals do, Ms Coulter uses facts that can be checked quite easily. She has a copmrehensive understanding of history.This book will make you laugh out loud. It clarifies the anti-American, lying, hypocratic policies of the liberal democrats.Thank god for Ann Coulter!"
3,Byron,"I was expecting a bit more of this book. While I like Anne Coulter and I enjoyed getting a chance to read her articles in reprint form, I think the book could have been a bit more forthcoming (i.e. this is a collection of reprinted articles) and priced accordingly. Still, it was nice to finally read what she writes that makes liberals go apoplectic."
4,Amusing,"After reading the reviews of this book, I simply HAD to read it! If the democrats actually liked this book, then it wouldn't be any good, right?Why is it that the liberals can spout off a random assortment of emotional (not intellectually thought out, mind you) statements about conservatives until the cows come home, but when a conservative speaks his or her mind, it's an outrage? I suppose you all think Al Franken and Michael Moore are above Ms. Coulter? Hypocracy seems a dominant trait among you.I think Ms. Coulter does a great job of pointing out that it is a FACT that the media is liberally biased (like it or not), and does so in an entertaining fashion."
3,"Come for the hate, stay for the, well, hate","I purchased this book after mistaking the title as a tell-all autobiography, and was interested to see if she had indeed dedicated two pages of this book to publish a list of all the men she has not slept with, as was rumored to me by a friend. Alas, no list was to be found (I am fairly certain my name would be on it).This book is more of the same from Ms. Coulter. If you hate Democrats and other left-leaning misfits, you'll love this book. If you don't, well, there's always that chateau on the French Riviera (that joke is always a crowd-pleaser at my local Republican Party functions).On a final note, however, can whole-heartedly recommend that you don't talk to liberals in the fashion that Ms. Coulter recommends: I have a latte-drenched Armani blazer to prove it."
5,Inspired to purchase her other books!,"Ann Coulter is someone who doesn't mind offending the overly sensitive liberal! She is funny and charming while discussing serious issues and delivering scathing criticisms. I don't know how she does it, or how I've missed her books up until now! LOVED IT! Leftists be afraid."
1,"Don't Read This Book, Unless You Must",A conservative diatribe. Avoid. Won't convince anyone who doesn't agree with her politics.
1,"If I could have left less than one star, I would have!","What an incredible waste of time and money. Frankly, I am now wary of the publishing house that promotes this writing. Going backwards Ann!!!"
1,"Poorly written, poorly reasoned",This book is a very poorly reasoned diatribe by a true American hate-monger. I shudder to think that people read this book and believe it to contain an ounce of truth. I am disappointed that such a smart women applies herself in this way. What a waste.
1,Female Neanderthal? Yes...,"Ann Coulter is nothing more than a self-loathing caricature of her own self. She hates liberals because she deep down inside really hates herself. If it werent for those evil liberals who fought for equal rights for women, she wouldnt have been able to spew all this self-loathing clap-trap she writes in her books. To put it quite simply, Ann Coulter wishes she would have been born a chauvinist man. Some might suggest that she really is. Just look at the Adams Apple!"
3,Read the book,"Come on people, read the book. 55 reviews the day the thing comes out? Give us all a break. If yuou have time to read this thing in one day, and write up a cogent review, more power to you. However, I bet you're all just on your lunch break pretending you have a clue. This, by the way, applies to both sides."
4,Things have changed,"I have always trusted Star Baton, however, it's been so long since I've bought one. This baton was skinnier than what I was used to so I felt a bit awkward. I also miss the texture change in the baton as this one is smooth, except for a small bump where the texture normally changed. I wish I had ordered one that resembled my ""old fashioned"" Star baton. All that aside, I love to twirl and love having another Star baton...the only one to buy!"
5,It's inexpensive and functional.,"It's inexpensive and functional. I let my students use it in classroom or lab for my lower level math courses, such as college algebra and precalculus. It's very suitable for this purpose. Thanks."
4,Was the author paid by the page?,"It is well written, clear but dont be deceived by the 460 pages - it's padded out with unnecessary pictures and wording. For example, to describe resizing of an image takes THREE pages (p103-105) simply to say don't use the 'resample' option. Then again another TWO pages (p108-109) later on to simply say use 'bicubic sharper"" when enlarging.Again well laid out, but so stretched out."
4,Step by step procedures in Photoshop,"Scott Kelby presents easy to follow instructions for processing photos in Photoshop in this authoritative compilation. Although these step-by-step instructions can be quite useful, the full scope of Photoshop is not covered. For those insteresed in practicality and bored by theory, this might be a plus."
2,tedious and long-winded,"The book begins with several pages of the author telling us how wonderful his wife is and a attempt-at-humor interview with himself. It then goes on to explain in detail how to burn data to a CD-ROM, followed by another few pages of how to create a contact sheet for the CD's jewel case. Just before the serious reader gives up on the book, it finally gets us to Adobe Bridge and the beginnings of information with substance. Though the book is filled with useful practical information, it is so bloated with banter-like filler that it makes for tedious reading. Like so many other of these types of how-to computer books, the some 450 pages could easily be condensed to half the size. But the publisher needs have justification to charge $40 for the book, hence the filler. I can recommend this book only if money is no object and you have a lot of patience."
3,Covers a lot of ground...but not a good choice for beginners,"This books covers a lot of ground and is probably very useful to intermediate to advanced photoshop users and intermediate to advanced digital photographers.But I am a beginning Photoshop user as well as a beginning digital photographer, and I feel that there is a lot of presumed Photoshop and photography knowledge that I don't have.Hint: The introduction to the book provides a URL where you can download the photos used as examples in the book, so that you can practice the techniques on the same photos as the author.I rated this book 3 stars as an average. For beginners this book would be 2 stars and for intermediate to advanced users this book would be 4 stars. It's probably a book beginners can grow into."
4,Photoshop reference manual,"I found this book to be a great ""Go To"" book while working in Photoshop. I have not tried to read it from cover to cover."
5,It is what I was looking for and could not have asked for an easier book in my opinion..,It's just what I needed to get started and could not have asked for an easier book to explain things.
4,All you could ever want to know,"The book is excellent. I've owned CS2 for nearly a year and never used it. The program appeared entirely to complicated and I just didn't have the patience to try and teach myself. I finally broke down and decided I needed to learn the program after a friend showed me some things he did in Photoshop to really enhance his photos. I purchased this book following the advice of some other amateur photographers and I couldn't be happier. First off the credentials of Scott Kelby are remarkable. You'd think the guy designed the program! The instructions are very straightforward and easy to follow. I've been nothing but impressed. Buy this if you want to learn Photoshop, period."
1,Basics Not Provided,"If you are a beginner as I am at Adobe Photoshop, then this is NOT the book for you. It is a more advanced text of Adobe, even though the contents of the book are very well done."
2,"good information, horrible writing",Obviously Kelby knows tons about Photoshop but his cutesy writing style and giant ego make it very difficult to concentrate on the information. There are lots better books on Photoshop out there.
5,BoxWave iPhone Stylus from Amazon,"For those of us who have long fingernails and are not keyboard savvy, this stylus is a necessity for emailing and texting."
4,Great big and impressive,"Watch works great , keeps great time and has a useful chronograph function. The only thing keeping this from a 5 star is that it is so big the crown has a tendency to dig into the top of my hand when I bend it up. Otherwise if your looking to make a statement you can't go wrong with this watch. The band is also a very neat material which will take all the abuse you can dish out on it."
4,Sweet Movie,"Mark Collie is my favorite country singer of all time, but when it comes to acting, he falls a bit short. Actually, all of the actors in this film could benefit from some acting lessons. Coley McCabe has a beautiful singing voice and I'm not sure why she's never made it on the country music scene, but she endears herself to the viewer and ultimately plays the kind of character everyone would love to have for a friend. I give this story a 4 star rating based on the storyline. It's a very sweet, feel good kind of movie with a little bit of humor thrown in. This balances out the lack of acting ability. It's a movie that I've enjoyed viewing several times."
3,Quirky,"Bought this because of the title. Like that it was set in Tuscaloosa. Was not quite what I expected, but it was still sort of cute."
5,important for Gaelic learners,"This dictionary, compiled by a well known Gaelic scholar, is a great book which helps the user to translate many modern words, including scientific and some technology words, as well as other terms which are not included in older dictionaries but are essential to talking about daily life with speakers of the living language. Works especially well if you have Edward Dwelly's Gaelic-English dictionary. One of the big three Gaelic reference books."
1,"Book is just as abrasive, mean and nasty as she is...","She claims she's a lady? A lady does not use the 'F' word the way she does. The book is just as abrasive, mean and nasty as she is. I thought by reading her story, I'd think better of her. I don't. She's not a lady, never has been, never will be, and the book just proves it."
3,"FUN ,FUN, FUN","Gosh, Ms. Janice's Wild Ride! This book is so much fun and so compelling that I could not put it down. Janice D. is a lot of things and completely frank is one of them. She dishes all the dirt on everyone who ever wronged her. But, she dishes the most dirt on herself. This is a really fun and sometimes painful read that anyone interested in the fashion world will love. Best last line of an autobiography ever.....""Vrooooom"". You'll get it if you read it."
5,What can you say,"So much vulnerability in this story...you get a great insight as to how Janice grew up, why she is as independent and tough as she is. LOVED this story!"
1,No Lifeguard on Duty and this book still managed to survive?,"Janice Dickinson.. I never heard of her before she wrote this sad excuse of a book. She just rants and rants on about her problems and it doesn't seem to amaze her that modeling was the ONLY choice for her. I think that througout the book she was pathetic and had none of my sympathy. Does she really want us to believe that she is one to be considered lucky to be alive? I should be lucky that I am still interested in reading after this piece of work. Don't like my review.. Take a Number.. ( quote from the ""author"" herslef)."
4,Easy Reading,I thought the subject was handled with a open writing style that is seldom seen in today's book world.
1,Good for soaking up puddles in garage?,"I gave this one star only because it is unusable in my case. My bobtail cat was highly sensitive to something in this litter and basically just laid around licking her belly all day. The belly fur came off and she just seemed lethargic and miserable to boot. I was about to take her to the vet and thought I'd give litter switch a try as I'd read elsewhere that this litter has affected other cat's in a similar way. Switched to Arm and Hammer and within HOURS not days, the licking stopped. Her hair grew back in a couple of weeks and she started behaving like a happy, little furball again."
3,Dance Routine--not for uncoordinated or advanced exerciser,"I am a beginning exerciser, I'm small framed and at 120 lbs and 5'5"" not in need of serious weight loss. But, I love to do this tape. It WILL get your heart rate up if you have dance experience and can do all the routines full out the first (or even second) time. I get my heart rate up and break a sweat with this video. You will NOT get your heart rate up if you can't follow along and have to sort of fake the moves and stand in front of your TV in frustration. I also think it's a little too easy for the hard core Method and Firm fans. True, there is NO Pilates work, I don't know why they lied about that. But this video is in my normal exercise rotation as a light 30 min (if you do all 3) workout, and is very good when I've been off aerobics for awhile. If you love dance and are in need of a light - medium workout, this one is for you."
1,Not worth the money...or the time!,"I bought this DVD in hopes of getting a good feel for what to expect on my first trip to Israel. What a mistake. The DVD is more like someone's home movie of thier vacation to the Levant with minimal editing added in. It presents very limited information and really is a waste of time and money to view or buy. I also bought Lonely Planet's ""Israel and the Palestinian Territories, a much better deal for my money!"
3,"Great sounding speaker, but....","not sure if it's compatible with the New Generation 6 Apple Classic iPods. I haven't been able to get any video from this speaker yet, I called Apple today and was informed that I need to check with Altec Lansing to see if their speaker is compatible with the new Ipod Generation 6 line.Best to All!"
1,review of The Amorous Mis-Adventures of Casanova,"This is a terrible film. I think Tony Curtis made it only because he was paid a lot and because he got to work with many nude women.As far as I'm concerned, the only redeeming value to this movie is the nude women, of which there are many.The plot is silly, the acting is atrocious, but the women are lovely."
2,"A poor copy, not an original","The dvd arrived on time and undamaged. However, the video quality of the dvd was very bad. This dvd in my opinion is a copy and not an original. I do not recommend buying this dvd from this source."
2,TI-81,If you need a graphing calculator for a calculas class this may do the trick but I recommend the TI-82r a higher model. This calculator did not have the features needed for my college class but it may be ok for a high school class. See what features you need and then buy it. The only good thing about it was you cant beat the price.
1,Another boring rehash,"Yet another forum for the author to rehash the ""good old days"" give her wannabes their 15 minutes of fame. I don't understand why someone who is an inspirational speaker and talented writer would travel this path."
1,Non registered vendor,I e-mailed you when I received the item there was no warranty with the product which makes me think you are an unauthorized vendor. I was very disapointed you did not respond to my email. Apparently you do not want repeat bussiness on your site. I belong to 2 very large computer clubs here in Florida and will make my feelings known when all the snowbirds are back down here in December.
1,Not Liking Spanx Cami,Someone told me about Skinny Cami and I'm loving it. I can go for that layered look and it expanded my wardrobe and I love the fit. Go to their website at [...] and see for yourself. I'm so happy to find a cami that works for me. I feel like I've lost 15 lbs when I put it on. I can step into it and feel comfortable all day and I don't worry about my tummy roll. The Spanx cami was only tolerable for an hour or so. I can wear the skinny cami all day and feel good. I highly recommend it!
4,Good and Interesting,I found myself really getting into this movie and I also wanted to know if this couple was going to hang in there into the end. This movie had a lot of different things going on to make the movie rather interesting.
4,Full of life,"Wonderful World is about, Ben Singer, a pessimist, who starts to turn his perspective on life around when his good friend Ibou becomes ill. Here, we have a soulful slice of life story with a touch of light humor. The film provides us with a realistic point of view on the world from the lead character. The emotions of Ben are emotions that we have all felt at times in our life. Through love as well as hurt, Ben begins to look at life with a bit more sunshine. The realism of the film, connects you with the characters and you are left with a very humane story. I think the film succeeds due to its rich simplicity. In the end we are left with a funny and heart-warming film. I would recommend this to anyone."
3,GOOD BUT NOT HIS BEST AT ALL !!!,"As always, the reader must first try to find where in time and place the action in the book is taking place !! In this case, it's in Greece against Greek partisans."
4,mayhem,"I first read Hassel's books when I was a schoolboy in the early 1970s. It was very absorbing stuff for youngsters who had been raised on stories about good, clean heroes winning the Battle of Britain and El Alamein. Its realistic portrayal of war from the perspective of those supposedly soulless Nazi monsters helped develop a healthy scepticism about heroic depictions of the Allies. However, in time the books become a bit repetitive and nihilistic. I am sure that most German soldiers were not as cynical as Hassel's group. In the end most of them fought with despairing heroism to defend their country and families rather than out of National Socialist idealism. The series of books are entertaining in some ways but they can be a bit depressing with all the slaughter and mayhem after a while. I suppose they still appeal as they have been republished after a number of years out of print."
4,Definitely not for ALL Blackmore fans but...,"...still an interesting piece of music. I was fortunate enough to see Blackmore's Night at Castle Waldeck/Germany back in 2001. A rare starlit summer night (and if you knew mid Germany's weather you would understand HOW rare this night really was) with Blackmore and company giving us a journey back into medieval ages. Many people dressed in medieval gowns and thus adding to the special atmosphere of the moment. One has to admit that Mrs Candice Night and her elegant and even funny way of guiding the audience through the night built a sharp contrast to Ritchie's usual ""Lord of Darkness""-image.A night I will never forget, and a night that this DVD-release manages to revive for me now. Sound (DTS) could not be better. Enjoy!!"
4,People of the Dead Sea Scrolls,"This historical novel gives some insight into who were these people and why did they write the scrolls. Some intelligent conjecture is used to fill in the story which follows the life journey of a man as he discovers who he is and what he should believe in. At a time of deep religious conviction the Essenes turn into a fatalistic religious group, not unlike some modernistic cults. The reader may draw their own parallels here. A very good read with excellent historical background."
3,Good but not perfect,"This was the perfect style for my place, which as a classic modernist look (think Wassily chairs and Coubusier lounges)and the price was dynamite. But like another product from this company it was very difficult to mount properly. I wonder whether the very low price I got it for was because of a design or manufacturing flaw, or if my mounting problems was just my incompetence with such things. I found somebody who could get it up eventually though. The low price I paid ultimately made it worth the effort but I would have been a lot more annoyed if I hadn't gotten a deal that compensated for the hassle of getting it up."
4,Donell Jones brings flavor to R&B,"I really feel that this album brought some real ghetto flavor to the table that you only have really heard from Levitti,LV,and Johnny P.It also has traditional love ballads and that's what makes this album special.The only weakness is that there are a couple of songs that r a little repetitive.But these days it just seems that most r&b artists appearing on the scene have that problem.Donell Jones seperated himself with some originality on this record his future looks bright,sucsessful and long,cuz this man has time to grow.The talent is there."
4,Silver,"a classic hard bop album full of great playing and solid tunes. this early version of the Horace Silver Quintet was basically the same personnel as The Jazz Messengers (Louis Hayes in place of Art Blakely)...and the performances are rock solid. Six Pieces Of Silver was the album that brought Horace Silver and his tasteful piano playing into the jazz spotlight back in 1956. ""Cool Eyes"" the reflective ballad ""Shirl"" and ""Senor Blues"" (3 different versions presnted on here) being the standout tracks on this great (and judging by the lack of reviews on this site; underheard) album."
5,Simply awesome!,A wonderful project for Cece. Her melodious silky tones carry you from start to finish! This one is one of my favorites!
5,,"the title track on this cd says it all everyone i believe has or is going through something this cd will make you think and realize others can go through things and prayer,praise and belief will get you through.this is the one to listen to."
2,Too crunchy,"I really wanted my kids to like this, But unfortunately they don't, it would not soak the milk so it stayed crunchy, and its bigger and bulkier than Cheerios ( which was the cereal I was trying to replace), I still think its very good quality (Organic and Non-GMO), I will offer it to my kids as a dry snack they might like it better, or try to cook it in milk to make a sort of porridge out of it and maybe include it in my baking."
2,tale of the mummy isn't much of a tale,i bought this on video years ago and made it thru only onceand i've tried to watch it many times! sorry but is one ofthe most boring mummy movies ever. it's not even a good enoughmovie at a cheap price. the mummy lives with tony curtis is amasterpiece compared to this and it's just a good mummy movie.
1,Boring,"This movie is really boring and not fun. The end is stupid and makes you wonder why you watched the whole film.I seriously recommend you to watch The Mummy with Brendan Fraser, it is so much cooler, really a great adventure"
2,not good for running...,"I run a lot and found these headphones uncomfortable and difficult to keep in place. They would slide out of my ears and never properly seated well. The back rubs against my neck and feels like it's pulling, even when I know the cord is free. The behind the ear design of the cord is clever, but not enough to save these headphones from the discard pile.I ended up being much happier with the Seinheisser (sp?) which fit great and sound great. They're a bit more expensive than the Nike Flight headphones though."
2,Review from a Runner,"I bought these headphones because the old headphones I had cracked after I sat on them.I saw the headphones at a good price, and since they were by Nike, I thought they would be something that would be designed with runners in mind.However, these headphones never felt like they stayed on correctly. When I ran they fit somewhat properly, that is, until I would start sweating. Then they would start sliding out of my ears, and any jerk or quick movement would knock them completely off . I was very disappointed with these headphones. I am not a jogger, I am an amateur runner, so maybe they weren't designed for 6 to 7 minute miles.Honestly, they didn't work for me, but I give them two stars because they are light, the sound is decent, and because there is a chance that they will fit properly on somebody elses head. For now I will look elsewhere for better headphones."
1,BAD,i am continually disappointed by all of nike's headphones. not only do they sound horrible but they quickly short out. I've bought 3 now and each one will short out within a couple of months. plus they don't even come close to staying in my ears for any length of time. [...]Can anyone make a decent pair of workout headphones????
1,Not good quality...,It only last for less than a year... I used it everyday to Jog and one day stop working... Started a noise and stop working... Do not recommend... Keep using your 4usd iPod headphones... 5 years and still working perfectly....
5,Stays Put,This serves it's purpose. If you want to hear your music while jogging/exercising it stays put.
3,To small,Cake toppers where sent out at a perfect time. but the only bad thing it was smaller than I imagine.
2,"so, so!","it good wok for stir fry, but not for tempura. it not maintain the high temp.& temp.probe is shown by number. i cook with temperature read out, such as 350 deg. F, 450 deg. F instead of 2, 4, 6....Wokself made by heavy material seems to me. it did not work for me."
4,Just Wokin' Around,"I bought this wok for my wife's birthday and she just loves it. She has wanted one for years but never got around to it. This was my first order ever placed with Amazon and it was a pleasure. The ordering process is easy and the wok was delivered on the front end of the timeframe, so that was pretty cool too! The wok does everything she expects and is very easy to use, clean and maintain. It is large enough to cook for our family of five and small enough to fit in the pantry storage space. Every meal prepared in this wok has been delicious, so it was a win-win for the family."
4,Healthy cooking...,Great wok! This is definitely a great find. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to start the year healthy.
2,NOT SURE,First one had spring base break when releasing bottom section after first use.Reordered then next one had stripped handles out of the box that wouldn't stay attached.Just started using third one we will see how this one works!After being on third one found out the non stick wears out on the center on wok making everything burn in center. Teflon or non stick is short lasting!!!
4,condition,The content of this book is very easy to understand. It contains defininitions with pictures associated with various terms. Very informational and interesting.Excellent for persons of all ages and backgrounds to read.
2,Boring.,"I didn't like it. It was so long and nothing really happened at all.The hero Nils was supposed to be a fierce viking from the past, but I thought he was quite tame and dull. The heroine Linnea was quite annoying because she was so wishy washy and could not make up her mind what she wanted. She was attracted to Nils, but she didn't like his arrogance (I didn't think he was arrogant) and she kept her maybe or maybe not betrothed Lord Tuthill waiting in the wings with his proposal of marriage throughout the whole story.I read about 75 percent of the story and I skimmed the rest because I couldn't take it anymore. Bored. :("
5,Lovely,"I've read a lot of books lately looking for something special, and this one finally fit the bill. Read it in one sitting with a smile on my face...perfect."
4,GREAT HISTORY OF AN IMPORTANT DIAMOND,MAGNIFICENT STORY OF THE REGENT DIAMOND AS IT TRAVELED THROUGH HISTORY FROM 18TH CENTURY INDIA TO ITS CURRENT HOME AT THE LOUVRE. GREED AND POWER FUELED THE LUST TO OWN THIS SYONE.
5,For The Heavy of Heart,"Your Sorrow is My Sorrow is one of those once in a lifetime books. I happened to pick this up by accident, or should I say by divine Providence. The words are comforting whether you have lost a loved one, to death, drugs or mistrust...this book will carry you through. The words of Mary come striking through to the heart and lay to rest in the lap of comfort and solace. The prayers are simple yet heartfelt. This is a book that will get you through the rough times. Thank you Joyce Rupp!"
3,Ain't to proud to say...,"It's an OKAY album. It was bumpin' back in the day. The best songs are ""Hat 2 Da Back"", ""Ain't 2 Proud To Beg"",""Baby Baby Baby"", and ""What About Your Friends"". The interludes are funny as H-E-double-hockey-sticks, but the rest of the songs are wack."
1,This is not the band flipsyde,There is no cover because it is trying to get you to buy it if you wanted flipsyde the band dont buy this I made the mistake allready this is a warning!!! this is definatly not what I wanted I probably wont listen to this home burnt cd again
1,Plain Brown Wrapper,"This seller, gbwviper, has sold this CD as being brand new from the factory, wherever that is. When I received it, there was crackling and popping in the background of every song. The only reason these should be in the background is if someone recorded the songs off an LP. If you have really good audio equipment, you will not be able to listen to this CD. Buyer beware!"
2,NOT LIKETHE OLD SCHOOL ONE,THIS GAME IS NOT LIKE THE ONES I PLAY ON NINTENDO. VERY SLOW AND TOTALLY DIFFERENT FROM WHAT I THOUGHT IT WAS.STICK TO THE NINTENDO VERSION OR YOU WILL BE VERY DISSAPOINTED.
4,WAKE UP to the sound of big mountain,"Though many of the songs lack a full band sound, the simplicity of the music and lyrics help to tell wonderful and inspiring stories. This is an album you can listen to any time, anywhere."
3,I'll bet she's lonely out there.....,"You can say what you want about her music, but there are not many musicians out there that sound like she does. I've heard her compared to Kate Bush...I like Tori and hate Kate...so I really can't see that comparison. I think this CD is her attempt to become less of an ""accquired taste"". I enjoyed it quite a bit though. The thing I like best about her CD's is that they don't all sound the same. I think she really tries to stretch herself musically and do something unique and expressive on every CD . That has become a rarity in music lately. There were a few songs I could've done without on this CD (Raspberry Swirl, thud thud thud and Northern Lad, overly dramatic, Tori can tend to be a ham at times.) But I still listen all the way through anyway, simply being grateful that all the songs don't sound exactly the same."
5,This is her best album yet!,"This,I believe,is her best album yet. Its' sound and lyrics are very inspiring.""Jackie's Strenght"" is a great song.It brings out a stream of emotions.So does the song ""Northern Lad."" Her songs have always helped me get through all the complications of life,especially this album. If you like Tori,then you'll LOVE this album."
5,She's the Best,"I still remember the day that I became a ""toriphile""-I popped in FTCH ( a friend had recommended it) and I was gone. I'd never even heard of her before that day, but I spent the next year acquiring everything and anything I could about her and by her. FTCH was and still is an amazingly competitive album, not dated at all. Though she has managed to disappoint me with ""beekeeper"" I still believe in her because I know what she can do, Little Earthquakes, Pele, etc. I would encourage anyone to listen to this CD because it just might change your musical life."
3,Haunting Vocals - Not as good as previous albums,"Though I am a fan of Tori Amos, but I found it difficult to get through Choir Girl the first time. I forced myself to listen to it over and over, not from an entertainment perspective, but from a talent perspective. The music and lyrics for Northern Lad and Liquid Diamonds are my favorites."
3,She's your cocaine?,"I get it and all, I'm just not feeling it. I guess that is the delineating factor when it comes to Tori: you either feel it with her or you don't. This one... not so much. There are some great sounds on this CD but lyrically I just did not feel that it was cohesive. Mine, thus, is rather dusty."
5,Exquisite.,"WOW..that's all I can say in regard to this album. Tori Amos is a musical genius. Unfortunately, it took me 5 years to buy this album. The whole thing is absolutely wonderful, from the haunting ""Spark"", to the beautiful ""Jackie's Strength"", the groovy ""Raspberry Swirl"", and the elegant ""Liquid Diamonds""...It's ALL good! I love the beginning of ""Black Dove"", how the piano playing almost sounds like you're listening to it under water. Get this album!"
5,Only the ignorant don't like this album!,"This is an album overflowing with passionate, raw, esoteric intensity. It defies convention at every possible turn. It is angts-wridden, yet with a very oblique sense of humour. Those who dismiss this album, almost casually; (such as our reviewer from the Czech Republic, below) manifest such intense musical ignorance it is almost difficult to call myself human, if so doing lumps myself in with them. This album, in fact ANYTHING by Tori Amos; is only for those willing to try something different. Those willing to LIVE and experience the full range of life. 'Nuff said"
2,Flaccid and forced,"Oh, the thrill is gone, it's REALLY gone. For those of us who had our worlds absolutely rocked by Little Earthquakes and were simply perplexed and bored by the subsequent albums, this album just confirms that Ms. Amos no longer aims to communicate just to confuse. No one buys the 'faerie-world' nonsense lyrics anymore, they only serve to reiterate the forced and flaccid feel of the melodies. Where does the listener fit into the scheme of things when the writing is so entirely cryptic and nonsensical? Her evasiveness and odd imagery worked to her advantage when the melodies told the stories (a la Earthquakes), but they simply further render the ever-developing self-caricature that she has become when placed alongside drab techno lite and snoozeworthy lounge music. Somebody find her push-up bra and give her some Aqua Net... Y Kant Tori Read was 10-fold more genuine and inspired than this poor specimen."
1,PLEASE PLEASE SAVE ME FROM THIS CRAP!,"I just do not get it??? Do you really call this music? Just because a woman can act outrageous and screech a lot, while writhing in orgasmic like states, does not make her an ""artist"". Tori Amos has to be one of the most overrated musicians I have ever ever ever heard. Right now anything sells, as long as you are politically correct and ""feel"" someone's friggin pain. Get over yourself."
1,Don't waste your money!,"She certainly looks like Jewel, but her music is much less original. Tori Amos can't sing from the heart, and her music is moving away from its original much loved style.I don't recommend this CD at all, the listening is unpleasant and boring."
5,excellent!,"Im only 16, but I've been a fan of Tori since Little Earthquakes. This album is such proof that Tori can change her style some and still have the most beautiful music. I love this album as I love all of her albums."
3,Thinner than I had hoped for....,"I have been searching for a novel that captivated me as much as ""Pillars of the Earth"", a bookstore clerk recommended this book she was not familiar with ""Pillars"" and unfortunately after a couple hundred pages it was obvious that this novel was not going to measure up. The character development and plot got thinner and thinner as the pages turned by. I did however finish the novel and was left unsatisfied. I felt the ending was too contrived. This was my first Jeffrey Archer novel at this point I don't believe I'm inspired enough to read another."
3,Iffy by Archer standards,"Kane and Abel, while an enjoyable book and a quick read, is not a champion by any stretch.The real problem is that Archer goes to great lengths to create interesting characters in the first half of the book, and then does boring and predictable things with them in the second.The result is a story that gives up the brisk pace of Not a Penny More, Not a Penny Less but doesn't pick up the reach-out-and-touch-them characterization of As the Crow Flies. It's pretty clear that Archer was working to fix what he got wrong in this book when he wrote Crow about a decade later."
2,a zipless read,"I expected an autobiographical book by a writer discussing her craft and the internal struggles of her professional life. Instead I found a book too literate for the tabloid reader, not insightful enough for the demonically possessed.The book mentions names whose relevance sometimes puzzled me; and summarizes books and movie themes, as if high school freshmen were the author's primary target. It discusses the seduction of the demon, mostly through other writers' observations. Why is it that we get a better sense of Henry Miller's ""dictation"" than Eric Jong's ""seduction""? And while she could have genuinely and thoroughly discussed her affair with the former Mr. Martha Stewart to give us a deeper understanding of its effect on her writing, she fails to go beyond the surface.The touch of love may turn a man into a poet, but this zipless seduction will barely teach you the alphabet."
2,Blech,"I read this book thinking it would be a good personal account of the authors life. I got nothing. She had an affair with Martha Stewarts husband - big deal. That was the only major thing she told us about. Perhaps this book was not meant to be a tell all memoir like most I read. Considering how outspoken Erica Jong usually is, I am dissapointed she held back after finally writing about herself. It was a very quick read, in fact I read it at jury duty one day, but if I had to tell anyone what the high points were, I would have to say none."
4,On The hook,"Sometimes an 80's artists really has a hard time staying ground in the U.S. Nevertheless, it has happened with Jody Watley. Although her popularity fizzled in the 90's, her voice hasn't remained sharper in years. Her 1998 R&B comeback single, Off The Hook, is a very sexy, seductive song from the 80's diva. The song was released from her no longer issued record, Flower. There are so many mixes here on this C.D. single, but the original track is the only version of the song that remains hot. It is just a shame that Jody Watley hasn't made anything this bold for awhile. Hopefully, she can find a way to seduce people into her music again."
5,Bad Boy Bill finally proves he's kickin it up!,"I have been an electronic music lover for 6 or 7 years now. To date I had never been impressed with the house sounds coming from BBB's fingertips...until now. I love electronic music but I'm very picky and only listen to the best.Behind The Decks is an energizing booty hop. If you listen to this and aren't dancing, you may need professional help. One can't help but shake their rump to this excellent mix of house music."
2,Good songwriting but no versatility what-so-ever,"With a voice like hers, it's very smart of her producers to keep her singing this style of music. They certainly know what they're doing. But admist all the talent of the producers and technical ability, that hauting voice (which one can obtain by loosing theirs and easily duplicated) and slurred speech left me longing for earplugs. No clarity in her voice what-so-ever. How can one go wrong with producers like Babyface and LA Reid? Their writing style and meloncholy beats does the CD justice. I give it two stars for that alone."
5,still the best,"after 10 years on release secrets still is one of my fav albums.I brought this album when i was ten ( YEAH A LIL DEEP FOR A TEN YEAR OLD BUT HEY THATS ME) now im all grown up i can appreicate this album for what it is ,a magnificent collection of pure bliss.Toni's voice is rich and emotive while the music is what truly makes this album one of the greatest ,melodic ,seductive and sexy bests. evey track just flows .The best tracks for me are let if flow love the guitar arragement,i love me some him,theres no me without you,find me a man and the timeless beauty that is how could an angel break my heart.Lovely saxaphone from kenny g flawless songwriting from babyface (one of my favs) and the beautiful voice of toni .what i love about toni is the way she pronounces every single letter of the lyrics she sings so amazingly.Toni might be on album number 5 but this will always be her higest moment .x"
5,Beautiful ballads,"This a a brilliant album from Toni. Beautiful ballads throughout and her voice is so soothing and sultry. My particular favourites are ""Un-break my heart"" and ""How could an Angel break my heart"", but all songs are good. This is an album I can listen to over and over again...beautiful. The 24 page booklet contains all lyrics and plenty of photos of Toni. If you're looking for an album for a romantic dinner or 'something', then look no further. Track #12 though, I think is a trick...it doesn't exist."
5,good quality,"These towels are as they were described, very colorful, nice to embroider on. They didn't fade or bleed when washed."
2,Wrong Shade of Yellow,I was very disapported in the towels. The shade shown in the example of yellow is way off. It looked like a butter yellow and is actually more of a mustard shade. Also the towels are much longer than standard towels. Looks strange when hanging.
2,Actually Puked From Cleaning the Box,"I have been using this for less than a week, and I am going to dump what's left. The litter itself smells weird, and after my cat goes, it does nothing to cover up the smell. She might as well have gone on the floor. I picked this litter because of the price, and I guess you get what you pay for."
1,Stinks,"I am quite disappointed. This litter is ""perfumed"" with a nasty chemical smell that stinks up the entire house. The stench is obviously most concentrated inside the litter box where the poor cats have to endure it (I am surprised they don't pass out from this crap). I had to spread this stuff out in a thin layer on a piece of cardboard and let it sit outside for about 9 hours just to get some of the chemical ""scent"" to diminish. I doubt this litter actually ""controls"" odor; instead, I think it just masks odors with its noxious chemical scent.It is sad how our culture has been duped into believing that the simulacrum an offensive odd chemical smell equates to a ""fresh"" scent.Also, the urine clumps are completely mushy. On the first day, I noticed my cat limping, apparently trying to get something off its paw. I found that the wet clumps stick aggressively to the bottoms of my cat's paws which I have to clean off by hand."
5,Fits perfect,This is a great product. Price is right and fits perfect. Very comfortable to wear. Easy to open and take phone in and out.
3,Good but trying to sell records...,"I like this album, but I bought it for Brian Culbertson's instrumentals. Some-how it just goes a little too popular(trying to sell records)not experimenting enough outside the mainstream"
5,Smooth and Sexy!!!,"I woke up to 'Stay Awhile' playing on the radio in the middle of the night. The rest of the CD didn't disappoint - smooth, sensual, mood music!"
1,Does not work with many --many motherboards,"This card has a known issue with many motherboards. When i purchased this product I had an msi k7n2 motherboard. this card installed fine but upon restart ""found new hardware"" icon popped up. I thought somehthing was wrong with my motherboard. So i went out and bought a new motherboard and processor. this time an msi k8n neo2 but to no avail. This card still does the same thing.If you doubt me go and check creative support site. There are hundereds of people out there with the same problem.DO NOT BUY."
1,Stopped working right away,My five year old son got this for Christmas. It worked really good for one week. Then it stopped working. We checked the batteries and the cars. We can't figure out why it stopped. My son was so disappointed. Plus the track itself is very flimsy. We wound up thowing out some of the track parts (railings and cardboard pictures) because we got tired of them falling off all the time. I would not recomend this toy.
3,race set,Be careful when you take the track apart. I did not pay attention when they took the track apart. The track will break if you are not careful.
1,"Cheap, Cheap, Cheap","Purchased this for my 3 yr old son for X-Mas. My husband spent 2 1/2 hours trying to get the thing to work X-Mas Eve. Wanted it set up and ready to run X-Mas morning. Checked all the connections, batteries, etc. Finally gave up. Never could get the thing to work. Worst piece of junk I ever purchased."
4,Excellent value for money,"Good fights, particularly as there aren't as many rules as there are now....Royce Gracie, Shamrock and Severn feature with Gracie (of course) dominating. Royce's fight with Kimo is good and shows how bjj can be used against a much bigger opponent..."
1,doesn't specify that it is for electric washers only,"Ordered this product and it seems well made, but until you receive the product, there is no statement saying that it is for electric machines only. Deception by omission. POOR POOR POOR"
3,Nice swivel but does not fit Husky 1800,"I bought this to replace the leaky gun on a Husky 1800 (NOT 1800S) I bought at Home Depot a few years ago. The hose fits my pressure washer but none of the four adapters shipped fit my wand -- they gush water even more than the gun does. I went to Home Depot today and was able to find a replacement gun and hose for $27 that perfectly fit my wand.Despite the fact that my wand doesn't fit this gun, it is reasonably well-constructed, the hose is more supple than the original and the gun pivots 360 degrees without kinking the hose. If this gun, or one of the adapters, happens to fit your pressure washer's wand, this is a good purchase."
1,Incomplete order,"I also received two hoses and no guns after ordering the ""replacement gun & hose kit"". Amazon customer service said that they would refund my credit card (hasn't happened yet) because they were having distribution issues with this item. Was told that I'd be notified via email when the complete kit was available again. Haven't heard from anyone but noticed that site is selling them again (as opposed to listing a future ship date). Would advise that potential buyers contact Amazon regarding inventory before purchasing this product."
2,Half way,Not a bad movie if you need ideas and want to be a screen writer but the whole idea of getting blood from bark is a total let down
5,Great Album,"I first heard this album three years ago and was blown away by it. The production as well as the lyrics are great. Most importantly the songs are actually about something and seem to have meaning to each artist. For instance on Guess Who each member briefly describes growing up and how they love their mothers'. This type of sincere honesty is not usually a characteristic of rap. In my opinion all of the songs are great but my personal favorites are Dirty South, Guess Who and The Day After. If you are a fan of good music, regardless of genre or region, you should give this album a try."
5,Scandelicious!,"This is one of the very best albums of all time. Hands down. It is not only Goodie Mob at their very best-- but it is also RAP MUSIC at its very best. These boys can WRITE SOME SERIOUS LYRICS... and they KNOW BEATS TO SING OVER.I was pretty disappointed with both following albums-- but Soul Food will NEVER GET OLD, and it is untouchable. Lyrics read like a moving novel.A must-have-- no question."
5,In the foot steps of Jodeci with a Babyface twist,"The men of A Few Good Men took most R&B listeners by surprise.They lit a romantic flame in ladies hearts with their smash hit ""Have I Never"" and brought back the sweet innocence of young love on the ballad ""Young Girl"".So if you're an inspiring R&B crooner I strongly suggest you check this disc out."
5,You'll love it !!,This is a movie that you won't want to miss a second of. I think it's actually better than the first one. It's hilariously funny and is a necessary film for a well selected collection.
5,Better than the first one!,Mcarthy and Silverman are great in a squel that is actually better than the first one!
2,Difficult to install and adjust,"We purchased this mount for Optoma HD33 projector (which is awesome btw). This is a universal mount so there are lots of extra nuts etc. It was difficult to install (poor instructions) - took us a long time. We finally managed to do it, but then the figuring out the 10 deg horizontal swivel took longer because it is hidden. The swivel adjustments need to be simple and not require an allen wrench. I think the design is flawed and would not recommend this mount."
3,Has too many angles to deal with,"This item does the job but is difficult to install due to the large number of screws and bolts which must be aligned and tightened. You think you have it set and then it slips and you must start over. After we got it up though, it has been working and we had no more trouble."
4,Very Secure,"I used it without the extension rod. It took a while to securely mount my BenQ PB7320 projector to the lower bracket, but once I figured out how to line up the mounting holes and found long enough screws (the supplied screws were too short), actually hanging and adjusting the projector was very easy. It has held the adjustment (roll, pitch) perfectly for about a month now, even after having the cables tugged on. The projector does not jiggle around even if I bang on the wall near it, slam doors, etc."
2,Poor quality and not entirely universal,I purchased this mount for my epson 8350 despite conflicting reviews if it would fit. I found a YouTube video describing how to add in extra hardware to make it work for my model. While the mount did in fact support the projector it was not strong enough to hold the projector level. I found that every couple days the projector image would drift a few inches down toward the left. After continually straightening the projector and re-tightening I noticed that the cheap quality metal was actually bending the projector mount.For a smaller projector this mount just might do the trick but for the Epson 8350 or any projector of similar size I would invest in a higher quality mount. I switched mine out for a chief mount and was amazed in the difference in quality and design. While I do recommend chief as an alternative I would not have been willing to pay up for the chief brand had I not spent 10 hours mounting and re- adjusting my projector with this mount.
1,"""Universal"" mount bracket doesn't fit Epson 8350","The thin is too small even when extended all arms to max.Nothing mentioned about dimensions in description. So, how should you know that it won't fit one of the most popular projectors on the market. Very dissapointed."
3,DOES NOT FIT EPSON PROJECTORS,"GREAT MOUNT IF I COULD USE IT. DOES NOT FIT EPSON PROJECTORS, NOT EVEN CLOSE.EPSON PROJECTORS ARE A MAJOR BRAND, VERY SURPRISED THIS MOUNT THAT CLAIMS TO FIT MOST PROJECTORS, DOES NOT.IT WOULD BE GREAT IF IT DID, AS IT HAS EVERY TYPE OF ADJUSTMENT FOR POSITIONING ALIGNMENT WITH SCREEN."
4,Projector Universal Mount,"Overall not bad and not overly difficult to mount a projector. If you require installation instructions, there is only a small drawing supplied of the mounting bracket."
5,Excellent starter set of high quality knives,"I just moved into a new condo this spring and was looking for a set of high quality knives to use in my new kitchen. This set is the most reasonably priced out of the Wusthof forged knife sets. It contains all the essential knives that you need, and they seem like they will last for years."
2,"The Deputy was a great late 50s-early 60s TV western, but...","This set from Timeless Media is pretty poor...of the first 3 episodes, an apology for poor quality precedes 2...as well there are only 12 total episodes...pretty rich at over $30...too bad NBC Universal chose to put their name on this...I expect better from that brand...I would be cautious of Timeless Media products in the future...bottom line, you've really got to love The Deputy for this to be worthwhile...unfortuately for me, I do..."
3,Pleasurable read but confusing,"I enjoyed learning about all the characters in the book, but I didn't see a theme. Getting to know this family was interesting, but I couldn't fathom what the author's message was, if, indeed, there was a message. Not understanding the purpose left one frustrated at the end."
2,Fell well short of my expectations...,"When I started reading this book, I was hopeful that it would be an insightful commentary on the ridiculous nature of politically-correct word choice. Unfortunately, I did not find it to be particularly clever or funny. On some level, it seems like the PC craze has subsided since the mid-90's when the book was written, and it just doesn't read as the brilliant critique that I expected. We've now heard so many silly descriptions followed by the suffix ""challenged"" that it just isn't funny anymore. I suppose that this book worked much better when it was written, but it hasn't aged well over the ten years since."
1,Yawn...the anti-political correctness brigade seems so trite,"Can anyone really imagine trying to read this and draw a roars of laughter from the politically incorrect crowd? As one reviewer said, ""trite"" is the best way to describe this book. It's one for the bargain dumpster.Political correctness is in the eye of the beholder but I guess the right-wing has hijacked it to attack any humane idea relating to feminism, the environment, etc. It's no surprise that no-one on the right criticised Attorney-General John Ashcroft for spending taxpayer's money to cover up the breast of the lady justice statue because he found it offensive. I bet if the Attorney was a Democrat, Rush Limbaugh and his cohorts would have howled ""politically correct""!!"
4,good item if you love Panang Curry,"good item if you love Panang Curry...........I fell in love with the flavor of Panang Curry, red style, while visiting my daughter near Langley AFB in Virginia last year.We wanted THAI food one day, and so we went to a THAI restaurant in the area.I ordered the Panang Curry.We went back 2 days later, and I ordered it again it was so delish :)I don't have THAI restaurants close to where I live back home in OHIO, so, saw this product and purchased it to try.Very good! Even good without the chicken added....and just using a few more vegetables instead.I recommend this product."
1,No flavor and VERY spicy,"I bought this panang curry paste because I LOVE Thai panang curry and hoped to be able to make it at home. I followed the directions and added it to coconut milk. There was almost NO flavor, and it was very spicy. The spicy-ness I can handle, but the lack of flavor was rreally disappointing. I even added more garlic to it once, another time I added some red curry paste, etc and it was still completely bland. I generally love products from this brand, but I wouldn't recommend this one at all."
2,It hurts me to say this about them.,"Bad Religion has been my favorite band for years so it hurts me to say this about them. It looks like Mr. Brett was the force behind the band musically. Grey Race was alright without him but No Substance is bad. The songs are cliched and far to much pop and not enough punk. Most of them would be indistingusable from any of the crap they play on any radio station. Easily their worst CD. Bad Religion has been in decline since No Control, with a slight revival with Stranger than Fiction, and I hope that they can stop the slide with the next one."
5,"Bad Religion's fans are getting worse, not their music","I'm getting sick of seeing negative reviews from so called ""true Bad Religion fans"" on Bad Religion's recent albums. I think albums like ""The Gray Race"" and ""No Sustance"" were excellent and just because their sound has changed over the years, that doesn't mean it's going down the tubes. You can't compare the intensity of ""Suffer"" or ""No Control"" to these recent albums and then say they are worse. Their sound has become slower over the years, but the lyrics are what makes a band stand out in the largely similar sound of rock music and Bad Religion's lyrics are as powerful as they were in the late eighties. Change isn't necessarily a bad thing, and in Bad Religion's case, it hasn't hurt them. ""No Substance"" and the other recent albums (""The Gray Race"" in particular) are great rock albums and don't be discouraged because of a few bad reviews from ""true Bad Religion fans"". Also, be on the lookout for Bad Religion's new album coming May 9, 2000."
2,NOT A GOOD ONE...,"This is BY FAR the worst album by BAD RELIGION...After so many great albuns, you can expect one less inspired moment...but no substance is really not a good one...I give it 2 stars, because it's BAD RELIGION, but this and the lame THE NEW AMERICA are terrible moments from the punk gods..."
2,well at least its not american lesions.......,"try and stay away from this. youre better off getting 80-85, suffer, no control, against the grain, and maybe the gray race. This album sounds like its gonna be great with the powerful ""Hear it"" and maintains its BR's esque soft side with ""Shades of Truth"" which i can take, but then it drops horribly, ""no substance"" is just naive and puts no congruent thought process into it. The millenium address is a nice jello biafra spoken word try by graffin (i still love ya though greg) and the rest of the album is average with some bright spots being the ""Hippy Killers"" a nice auto biography of punk rock in general and the questioning of punk rock with ""Victims of the Revolution"" All in all just wait for the 20th anniversrey album coming out on epitaph."
2,Ouch....,"I consider this the worst album of the ""major label years"". (the worst album in the BR catalog is of course ""into the unknown"") Now what went wrong? Of course Mr Brett's absence.... but The Gray Race was actually good. The problem here is the lack of catchy songs. Greg singing is good as usual, the playing is great, but there are no catchy songs. Except for ""Hear it"" and ""Raise your Voice"". The rest just drags along.If you want to own everything from BR, this is the last album to get. (because you can't get ""into the unknown"")"
3,Not up to Father Greeley's usual standards,"Admittedly, the Chucky O'Malley series is not one of my favorites. I found the others to be more entertaining than this one. This novel basically recycles alot of the previous data with precious little new story. Enjoyable, but not the best."
2,nothing new,"The race is nothing more than The Goal with the fluff stripped off. There is no details to support Goldratt's theories. There is a stunning lack of any specific examples. While The Goal is an excellent work, The Race appears to be nothing more than the outline used. This book would be better used in the classroom to support The Goal as a text book."
2,Talk about slow,"This book was boring, and at some parts it was okay, if you like slow books this is for you, I wouldn't exactly say you'll like it."
5,The Best Outkast Album,"This is the old school ATliens CD which in my opion was the best CD that OUTkast made. This CD was responsible for getting OUTKAST heard because it produced ... with a flow style that just made the party hip-to-the-hop. If you just got into OUTKAST recently and never heard this CD, you must get this cd immediatly!"
5,Kicks Ass!!!,"I wanted to buy this album for a long time and I finally did and it rocked my planet. If you like Outkast and don't have this album, you must have it. Even if the rest of the album were marginal, songs 2, 3 and 4 are worth the price alone. Outkast is one of the best groups around. GET THIS ALBUM!!!!!"
4,Georgia On My Mind!,"Outkast MC's Dre and Big Boi drop old-school styles over funky Southern-fried Atlanta beats. 96 hiphop release from LaFace Records -- best track: Decatur Psalm(10).Cooler than the Fonz, Outkast representin' Georgia - SouthSide... This one also comes complete with the super-dope liner notes/comic book! Outkast bringing the whole package. Imagine Mint Juleps in July. END"
4,STILL STRONG!,"THIS FOLLOW-UP ALBUM SHOWS THAT THES GUYS AIN'T GOIN' NO WHERE ANYTIME SOON! THE COMIC BOOK-LIKE INSERT AND SPACE-AGED BEATS R INGENIOUS! ""2 DOPE BOYS IN A CADILLAC"", IS A SONG U CAN REALLY RELATE TO. ""OVA DA WOODS"", THAT TRACK HAS A KILLER BEAT PATTERN AND MY PERSONAL FAV, ""ELEVATORS"", THAT TRACK IS THE KINDA SONG U PUT INTO UR CAR'S CD PLAYER AND IT'S MAKES UR DRIVE TO WHEREEVER U R GOING AS SMOOTH AS IT CAN GET. IF U GOT SOME BOOM IN UR TRUNK, THAT'S EVEN BETTER! THAT IS A SICK BEAT!"
4,HOLDIN' DOWN THE SOUTH,"I HAD NEVER HEARD THE OUTKAST TILL AQUEMINI AND I THOUGHT THAT WAS ONE OF THE BEST CD'S EVER. tHEN MY FRIEND PLAYED ME SOME OF THEIR $HIT OFF ATLiens AND I WAS BLOWN AWAY. IT IS IN A WAY BETTER THEN THE NEW ONE. DRE AND BIG BOI WERE TOTALY ON WHEN THEY MADE THIS ALBUM. TRACKS LIKE 2 DOPE BOYZ, JAZZY BELLY, WALLIN', MAINSTREAM, GROWING OLD, AND THE TITLE TRACK ATLeins KEEP THIS ONE IN MY CD PLAYER AT LEAST ONCE A DAY. THIS CD IS ONE OF THE MOST WELL ROUNDED I'VE HEARD AND I GIVE THE GEMINI AND AQUARIS MAD PROPS FOR IT AND FOR KEEPING THE STANDARDS UP BY ELEVATING THEIR GAME WITH EVERY NEW ALBUM. AS LONG AS DRE AND BOI CONTINUE TO BUST OUT WITH FLOWS LIKE ""I'VE FOUND A SHARPER WEAPON THAT NEVER RUNS OUT OF AMUNITION SO I'M READY FOR WAR, OK"" AND STILL SOUND AS DOPE AS NOW. THEIR $HIT WILL BE AROUND LONG AFTER I'M GONE."
3,Outkast cash in,"3 1/2Although it would take another album until this dynamic hip-hop duo would seemingly solely reinvigorate the genre, ATLeins represents them, and consequently rap, at its late-old-school best."
5,so good,This novel was so good to read it's been a long time since i had the privilege to read a romance novel and it felt good to get back into reading them again.This was my first time reading anything by these author's and their storie's were all good I really enjoyed Sandra and Anita's stories. Good work.They were heart felt stories about sisters and their every day life problems.
3,"Good material, pacing felt off","This feels like an action film that forgot to take it's thyroid meds. The material is good, but the pacing is off. The character development is limited by the number of pages available, and the ""weapons inspector who hates guns"" just didn't sit right with me; there was more story there that would have been useful to the story as a whole."
1,Poor remake,This is a lousy remake of a very fanous French movie. Do not waste your time with this but instead get the original movie: Le Pere Noel est une Ordure. You will have real fun
5,What a classic!,"The elavator scene, the love songsby adam Sandler, the vet. I was laughing out loud almost the whole movie it is an underated masterpeice."
1,False Advertisement illeagle laws,Buyer Beware this is not the first time columbia tristar has done this the dvd package states on the back side a is a widescreen 1.85.1 aspect ratio and side b is full frame format. But there is no side a widescreen. Once again illeagle procedure and false advertisement that should result in lawsuites. BUYER BEWARE
4,the funniest movie i've have ever seen!!!!!!,"it has it's stupid parts, but that's what makes it funny"
1,It just...lays there.,"This film had potential. Steve Martin was hilarious in THE JERK and was excellent in a more conventional comedic role in L.A. STORY.But MIXED NUTS just lays there. Script is banal, unfunny, and unoriginal. I've repeatedly seen the same ""jokes"" and setups in a UCLA Extension comedy writing class I've taken a few times.Parker Posey is wasted. She's got two lines in the beginning of the film, and two at the end. Two minutes screen time total.The setup of a suicide clinic on Chistmas Eve is ignored. Instead we get listless subplots concerning ""wacky"" characters. Steve Martin's mousy co-worker secretly loves him. Julliette Lewis provides the co-worker with a red dress, so then Steve notices her. There's also a fruitcake that nobody wants. People keep passing it on throughout the film.Ha, ha. Gotta love a film with a running fruitcake joke."
4,Its one of my favorite Ephron movies...,"Its kind of stupid, but that's what makes it great. Liev Shrieber is so funny! Madeline Kahn, Juliette Lewis, Adam Sandler, all of them. Its been our Christmas movie for a few years now. (Anyone else think Liev is hot in that outfit?)"
4,Good...definately good...reads fast and good...,"Geez...what can I say about this book? Well...I could start by saying that is was an excellent novel. Being 16 years old and all, this book really explained to me how some of the old southerners thought. They still had pride in the ""old south"" and it fascinated me that the old judge wanted Confederate money to be made redeemable into US dollars. I just could believe it. It portrayed racist, economic, and political issues in a very believable way. It was, all in all, emotional and it really had every emotion contained within it. At times it was funny. At times is was serious. Sometimes it was happy. Sometimes it was sad. It really gets you going once you read the first 10 pages. I liked it very much and do recommend it to everyone -- regardless of age."
1,Filter Kit,Installed this & it worked fine for two weeks then started leaking around the large black screw on top. This leak started on it's own without any interference or vibration/movement. Tried tightening & took apart & retightened. Gasket still appears new with no flaws. Cannot stop the leak. I stopped using it.
2,This Is One Album I Don't Miss,"I had ""CrazySexyCool"" when I was in high school and after listening to it a few times, I sold it to one of my classmates. The only songs I liked on the album were the ones released as singles. Everything else was just whatever. After ""Waterfalls,"" TLC turned pop so quick that it made my head spin. And for as long as TLC has been out, I never cared much about T-Boz's singing. But after hearing a TLC song on the radio the other day, I realized that T-Boz sings like a croaking frog. RIBBIT!"
4,there best,"this disc is solid.good song-writting&production.a musical vibe of Babyface&prince.waterfalls,red light special,creep etc..this is there best by far&away."
5,"Toni means "" Best of the Best""","Voice of a angel and body of a goddess. My favorite artist of all time. ""Toni Rocks!!@#)*("""
1,"Pathetic offer- - - so much $, no track info. How can I buy????",It is so sad to see an item as expensive as this with NO track info much less ability to listen to samples. How can you expect anyone to buy this???????????
3,PLASTIC !!!,This is plastic not metal as it appears in the description. It is a bit more difficult to turn than my old lazy susan.
4,worth the money,For the price this product worked well for me. I have had dark circles under my eyes since childhood. It didn't totally get rid of them but noticably lightened them. I haven't finished the first tube yet so it may even get better.
2,no results,"Did not really help with my dark circles. Not that bad as a regular eye cream, but no visible results on my dark circles even after I used the entire tube."
4,"For the last time, No More Editing!","What is up with the editing again! There was so much good parts cut off! After watching the japanese version for the 500th time, I was expecting the english version to be a little similar. Maybe its because I am so used hearing Usagi's ""real"" high pitch voice, that Terri Hawkes voice just doesn't get my excitement going for the movie. It was also no suprise that Pioneer used the song ""The Power of Love"", I had an instinct they would because that song fitted the scene well, but still...Moon Revenge rules. I guess Pioneer was too cheap to come up with a new song for the movie. I guess a soundtrack is out of the question too. Overall, it wasn't bad at all it was just annoying to see how many scenes were edited out when you were expecting to see them."
5,Best Sailor Moon Movie Ever,"The title says all. Sailor Moon has been my favorite anime since I was a kid. When I was young, I was aware that it was originally made in Japanese, but I didn't show any interest until I got older. With all the talk about how original animes are always better than the dubs, I wanted to know what it was like to watch Sailor Moon in Japanese.I finally did when I got this DVD. Everyone was right. Although the dub is still pretty good, the original is even more better. The dialogue is more accurate and doesn't include major cheesy lines like ""MOON MAMA"" *cringes*. The original music is also 100 times better. It matches the mood with the movie more often than the edited dub did. ""Moon Revenge"" is an awesome song :-).I suggest to anyone who hasn't seen this movie yet or has seen the edited dub to watch the original subtitled version. You'll find that it's much better, and enjoy :-)."
3,Ack!,"This movie, I would have to say, was WAY better in Japanese. I love Sailor Moon but after watching the Japanese the American was just not the same. The Japanese put soo much more feeling into their words and the way they changed things cut things short cut out phrases, it was just bad. I loved this movie in Japanese so see it that way. Yes the Japanese may sound funny and you may giggle but it's way better and you'll get usued to it! I recomend you see the original. Of course even with how sad this copy of sailor moon was I'm still ordering all of the other tapes out of sad obsessions ^_^;;. Well anyway Ja-ne!"
5,Round of applause for pioneer.,"This movie was so good I both laughed and cried. Any true Sailormoon fan will love this movie to pieces. It has everthing you would want in a movie action, romance, humor, and of course SAILOR MOON. Buy this movie now! the music is great and the plot is terrific."
2,Highly disappointed,"Pioneer did a very poor job at keeping the Dubbed version like the original. DiC could have done a better job. Some of the attacks are changed and the plot is very confusing. Dictation was horrible. Words were poorly choosen. Unless you are a SM-fanatic, don't buy this movie. It will be interesting what Pioneer will do with S and SS movie"
1,NOOOO!,"I own the subbed version and it was soooooo good, I was so excited when the dubbed version came out and i was the first person at the video store to get it when i got home i almost started crying! I hated it i sat there trying to figure out what was up with ami's voice and whats up with fiore he sounds like bill gates. Pioneer also adds needless talk we can see they're flowers, we can see fiore is disappearing. and the seedlings talk when in the japanese they don't. plus they put power of love for the endding song didn't they already use that? Compose a new song! Can you tell I don't like the dubbing job, there are a lot of other things i disliked but I leave that to you to find because I may excede my 1000 words. If you are getting this for your little 4 year old child then i would recommend it but as i have found many Sailormoon fans are above the age of 12. By the way don't call her serenity pleassse call her serena or something not serenity or princess serenity."
5,"Great Plot, Plenty of Action, and the Seera Senshi !","Konnichi'wa minna,Boku think this movie is sugoi! It's a kakoi movie! It has the inner Senshi trying to solve a mystery of a new evil who has it in for Usagi. The Senshi fight through hardship, and battle to the end for their princess. Demo when it all seems lost. It shows that true honor and forgiveness will win out in the end.And this movie Is SOOOO KAWAII! Especially little Chibi Usagi handing Mamoru a rose ;.; so KAWAII :DJa ne'Arigatou for the review"
2,Subtitled was MUCH better..,"At a friend's birthday party, my friends and I had rented the dubbed Sailor Moon R and S movies from our local movie rental store. Already owning the subtitled R, S, and SuperS movies, I could tell there were many many differences. first of all, they could have done better with the outers' voices. The dubbed movie was exceptionally good with their attack names and the edited stuff--there wasn't much missing. If you want to experience true anime, I'd get the subtitled movies. If you're a bit younger, and aren't aquainted with cursing or partual-hentai, get the subtitled movies."
3,GET THE FRIGGEN SUBBED!!!,I gave it 3 stars despite it being my favorite movie of the 3 but because the dubbed version sucked major. i'd give a perfect 5 to the sub though because the friggen Moon Revenge song is GONE at the end! WHA??! and uh cutting a few important parts made things worse and the voices were stupid. GET THE SUBBED! I BEG YOU!!! other than that i LOVE it! ~KeyLain
4,Great dub! =),"I think Pioneer did a good job with this movie. The only thing I wish they would've kept is the intro when they are riding a bus to the greenhouse and Moon Revenge at the end instead of Power of Love. But overall, it was great. Very few things were cut compared to the job Dic would've done. Highly recommended!"
5,Great Movie,It was a great movie. Any Sailor Moon fan would agree. I have the sub titled version it is much better than the DiC versions of the show. I do hope that they will dub more of the shows. If anyone has any cool pic or AVIs of Sailor Moon show a and/or movies email me at jasper8347@hotmail.com. Thanks maybe I get you some pic too.
5,Five Stars Up,"This movie is the koolest! Sailor Moon rocks and so does all her movies. An alien tries to steal Daren away from Serena but she ain't having all this ""funny business"". So she wins Daren's heart and saves the day! And as Serena would Say, ""MOON DUSTED!"""
3,Good But Bad,Everything in this movie was great *EXCEPT* near the end at the final battle when sailor moon fights she is Naked! its diosgusting but if you dont care about emmoral stuff by all means buy is
5,Usagi rocks,This movie is so cool that I love how usagi's odangos (serena's meatballs) look when she is so little. She looks like a stuffed doll you can hug. This movie would make any sailor mooon fan cry. A must see for every sailor moon fan. USAGI ROCKS
5,Great movie!!! can't wait for the dubbed version,"My friend saw this and said it wasn't so good but she and I disagree on a lot (they call us Raye and Serena:P)so I didn't know what to expect. When I watched this it literally blew my mind! It is soooo cool:P!!! Igive it a great thumbs up from Sailor Stellar:):P;P. Any other senshi fans who want to e-mail me, go ahead I'love to network.And thanks to ever one assosiated with sailor moon *peace sign*:P"
5,A fine sailor moon movie!,"I have seen all 200 episodes and all 3 movies. The sailor moon R movie has a great ending with a good story behind it. It has alot of action, suspense and more. Out of all the movies i like this one as my secound favorite with sailor moon super s movie in the lead. This movie is one of the best of sailor moon. It begins on a quite, peaceful day with the scouts visiting a garden. Then a person from mamoru (Darien) past enters as an alien with an old pledge to find him the perfect flower. Usagi (serena) helps to show this person the true meaning of friendship. With a dramatic end this movie will surely capture the minds of the audience. I look foward to seeing it in an english not cut format."
5,Now that's the best Animated movie I ever saw,"Although I love the dub, you gotta have this movie to appreciate the original version of Sailor Moon. The animation is excellent, the story is simple, and easy to follow, and it's Sailor Moon!! By that, I mean that you can laugh in one scene, and cry in the next. It's the only ""Anime"" I saw in which I cried. It's so beautiful!!! You gotta see it. Moon Revenge is a hothothot song!!! Buy it today"
4,Sugoi!,"Wow! This movie was great! Altough I like the S movie better, this one is very cool! The ending song, Moon Revenge, is one of the coolest songs I have ever heard! I am trying to learn to sing it in Japanese =) There are a few parts that may be ""innapropriate"" but it makes the movie better that way! I jsu thave to say this one more time, it is the bomb! Ciao! P.S. HAH! This movie makes me wonder about Mamoru and Fiore ;)~"
4,This movie totally rocks!!!,"This movie is really really cool. If you are a big fan of Sailor Moon, or even if you're not, I think that most people will love this movie. I have seen all the Sailor Moon movies in their uncut/Japanese non-subtitled versions, and I think it is great that Pioneer is finally going to release this movie to the USA and not DiC. Although this isn't my absolute favorite Sailor Moon movie out of the 3 that are available, it is very cool. I've watched it many many times over, and each time it just gets better and better. :) If you've only seen the DiC dubs that are available in the US, wait until you see this movie, and then you'll REALLY see what Sailor Moon is like. Hearing it in its pure Japanese language form makes it even better than any dub you'll get in the USA. :)"
1,MY POOR EYES!,"I walked into my local video store to browse, and they just happened to be playing the dubbed ""R"" movie. After watching it for about 10 minutes, I had to leave the store in disgust. The dubbed version of Sailor Moon was AWFUL! Dic removed most of the superb Japanese music, leaving awkward dead air in some spots. The rewritten dialogue was even worse. They just added in stupid one-liners that would appeal more to 5-year-olds. When Rini said ""Do your thing, Moon Mama!"" that was about when I left the store, grimacing. If you can get the original Japanese uncut version, you MUST see it! The music is beautiful and, most importantly, it's UNCUT! It's 100 times better that anything Dic could ever dub."
5,Sailormoon is the Bomb!,"I love this movie. It goes into more depth of the characters. And did I hear the original actress to play Raye( Sailor Mars)? There was no editing. I was almost shocked to see Sailormoon barely nude. The scenes between Serena and Darien were sweet to show that Darien does truly care about her. I thought it was sweet that Reenie called Serena momma? Now what about Darien Daddy? Anywho,didn't anybody notice that Fiore looked exactly like Alan from the Doom Tree Series? Maybe he's a cousin. I recommend this movie 10 stars."
5,Supereb Movie and the best one amongst three,"SailorMoon R the Movie is the greatest one amongst the three movie.The song is great...Moon Revenge...the storyline is very good...the fight scenes are good and bit rougher than TV series and that why this movie is better than the series one.And plus this time all the sailors used their powers equally.And all the flashbacks really revealed who the sailors in reality as human being and before they got the planets powers from Luna.To Sailormoon fans,you guys must buy this movie!!!"
5,It's the hotest movie of the Century!,When I ordered it and I couldn't get away from the T.V. I think it is awsome!!!And as a Sailor Moon Fan I can't wait to get every other vidieo like Amys first love or some others I can't realy think of right now. *.~
4,Moon Princess,"Sorry peeps This is maureen.My last review was horrible.Now,IT DID NOT HAVE NUDITY.Just pretend the upper half of a naked barbie doll.Thats all.Also I thought it was sort of corny.Oh yah.""My love"".Now that was corny.Also ""Go get em MoonMama"".What the heck was Rini thinking of.Any how it was a good movie.So parents don't be alarmed, kids can see it."
4,Vintage Pete Rock!!!,"Yo, PR did his thing on this one. The first disc is definitely easier to listen to because oof the mic skills of Rob O and Grap Luva. Standout tracks: The Life I live, Square One, Fakin' Jax,and Mind Over Matter. Definite treasure. If you want that ol' '94 flava type Pete Rock, this is the album."
5,Nice thick rawhide chews,"I have a ten pound silky terrier, and these keep her entertained for hours. These are very thick and last for days rather than a few minutes like the ones I had been getting at PetSmart. They are very long, I would prefer they were cut in half since my dog is small, but she seems to manage them ok. I would definitely buy again."
2,one hit wonder clone,this cat is a one hit wonder clone.2nd tier BabyFace&Prince.aside from nobody knows the rest of his album is flat.he should just stick to song-writting.cuz his Productions and singing just ride off of Babyface's&prince's backs.
5,dazzling,"I think it is an excellent collection of Stevie Nicks songs. She is my favorite singer/song writer, there are times when I want to just listen to her for hours. This would be an excellent way to do it. The only thing I wish, is that she could have included more of her Fleetwood Mac songs, but maybe there was a reason she couldn't. Also, I would have put on a live version of Rhiannon, instead of the piano version. There were lots of songs I knew, and some I didn't so that was neat. More songs of Stevie Nick's to fall in love with.Sincerely,FairyHeart"
5,Stevie's best all in one box! It doesn't get any better!,"This is a must have for the big Stevie fan - not only does it have many previously released songs, but many never released, demos, etc. My favorite is Long Distance Winner from the Buckingham Nicks days. I wish they would release that album again!"
5,GREAT FANCY ROYALTY LOOKING STATUE.,"I absolutely love this statue. This lion is not just for your ordinary person this staue is for someone who has style and likes the look of royalty. If you have the attitude of a king or queen, then purchase this beautiful statue and watch your friends envy you with green. Believe me this statue is a one of a kind. it will give you the rich look you have always wanted at the fraction of the price."
5,"Heart Warming, Great young man, Great courage and Strength","This is the book once you read it, There is no way of putting it down you want to see what happens next, I went to High School with this young man, and I knew the beginning of the book, but as time went on we went our different ways and I couldn't wait to find out about Buddy where he went and all the years of struggle he went through, I couldn't have imagined all what he had to go through with, I can't explain things very well, but YES I did shed a few tears, I recommend this book to everyone, because it's all true, and it just warms your heart, what else can I say you will just have to read it, I'm so proud of this young man and the talent he had to write his autobiography about his good times and all the sorrow times. Love you BuddyDarline Hutson Parten"
2,Repetitive and uninvolving.,"I like Terry Brooks, and enjoyed the first book in this series. It was cute and fun. This book, however, is akin to running in circles. Ben, the main character, is made to look like someone else by an evil wizard, who in turn, steals his identity. Good so far. Then Ben spends nearly 300 pages trying to convince his friends of who he really is. Now you lost me, Mr. Brooks.Your characters can't possibly be THIS stupid. As a reader, it's frustrating seeing the story take so long to get to the point. For another, I didn't know or care what the black unicorn was or why everyone wanted it. I stopped reading at page 250-something (out of 309 pages). If it takes longer than that to reveal such an important plot point, you just didn't tell the story correctly. I think I'll abandon this series now."
5,BRAINCHILD,THIS ALBUM IS ONE OF THE BEST ALBUMS I HAVE EVER HEARD. I RECOMMEND YOU BUY THIS ALBUM IF YOU LIKE THAT SMOOTH SOUL SOUND. I LOVED THIS ALBUM AND IT WAS SHIPPED TO ME IN A PROPER MANNER.
5,Still His Most Soulful Album,"Usher first burst onto the scene with the song Call Me A Mack from the Poetic Justice soundtrack and his debut solo appeared a year later. Usher was singing with so much soul on this CD,it was kind of a shock when he went pop on his later work. The CD featured the up-tempo hit Think Of You written by Donell Jones and the lead single I'll Make It Right which sampled Audio Two's Top Billin was very catchy and had a new jack feel to it. Usher's strongest work here is the ballads though. He enlisted Devante to produce Can U Get Wit It and Al B. Sure handed Usher one of his songs ever in the form of The Many Ways. Another very strong ballad is Whispers. Usher may not ever return to the soulfulness found on this CD as music has changed but for some classic soul check out this CD."
4,Close to five stars,"I just learned about Buckethead when I saw a news blurb about him leaving GnR. I did some amazon searching and checked out this album and Monsters and Robots. He's pretty amazing. His music is not what you'd expect from a guitar hero. If you like Wax Trax records, harder electronica like Front 242 then you'll be pleasantly surprised with Bucket's stuff. He defies being in a category and for someone like myself who generally abhors what they play on the radio his music is a welcome relief from the norm. He's got the talent, his music can be challenging, but when it comes down to it, he delivers in a big way. But....I don't get the KFC bucket thing...do you?"
2,Really not very good...,"I really hate to do this since I own and love 5 other Buckethead and Buckethead-related CD's. But this CD is not very good - only tracks 2,3,& 4 are very listenable. I don't know what he was going for on this one, but you really only get a few trance-type songs and some odd noise songs? with very minimal guitar! I really love his Monsters and Robots, Giant Robot, most of Colma, COBRA STRIKE, PRAXIS-Transmutation...and Metatron, but I feel this CD is really lacking in what Buckethead is capable of doing. Very odd and disappointing (I already sold mine on e-bay). Sorry again..."
3,Not Enough Sparkle,"This is a pretty bracelet and someone else might like it, but it didn't have enough sparkle for me."
4,good summary,This is a good quick read of the summary of Elijah. At times I had to reference the Bible to verify details. I was surprised to see the accuracy in the story. The book would have been better if the author would have provided some insight to the story.
4,A wonderfull and refreshing story of a remarkable woman,"It is rare to find a book that is so uncontrived and refreshing to read. A true story that would appeal to anyone interested in reading about sheep hearding in the west. But more than anything else, this is a story about a remarkable woman and her family that will surely touch the heart of anyone who reads it."
4,Don't think this is Led Zepplin,"Great album. It's not Led Zep. Don't expect it to be. Led Zep was a foursome where all the members contributed to every song, which is why the songs on ""Walking into Clarksdale"" isn't as Led Zepplin as a lot of people and music critics wanted it to be. This is only half of Led Zep. Granted, it's the lyricist and the songwriter, but without John Paul Jones and Bonham the extra touches and depth that Led Zep had aren't nearly as apparent--but they are there if you listen for them. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because of the mixing problems. Bass line is buried somewhere in there, but it's next to impossible to find. Drums take a slight hiatus on this album."
2,The Lemon Album,"Ouch, that might sound harsh, but I've been getting into the Robert Plant albums of late. He was exploring new areas, getting new sounds. I love Led Zep, but I really think Plant is weiged down by Page, trying to swim with the proverbial anchor."
3,Led Zeppelin it's Not.,"Don't expect any Led Zeppelin on this cd because it's not there. It's an abscure variety of middle eastern and celtic ballads that are badly out of tune. Unfortunately, time and age have caught up with Robert's voice and it shows as he struggles throughout much of the album to find his old chords. Listen to this with an open mind and you may not be disappointed, but if you're looking for any resembalance to the old days then forget it."
4,Thomas the train ride on train,"Thomas the train is an adorable train. Very cute, my daughter is 21/2 and loves the train. The pros are it is very attractive looks just like the thomas cartoon. Very large and the train makes a nice sound. The cons are that it is a little slow.(i have peg pergo green and red sante fe train and they are faster- i keep all three trains on a very large track and have three kids riding at the same time.)the button to make train go has to be bungied to keep going on thomas becouse it is hard to hold for a very long time. All in all the train is wonderful and keeps my daughter and her friends busy for a very long time. Riding time is about 1 1/2 hours.(continuous)"
3,Ride-on Thomas,"I really liked the size and quality of the product. The child I purchased this for is 2yrs old, but small for his age. The train is too hard for him to work. In order to make the train move, you need to hold down on the handle. If you let up just a bit, the train will stop. He could not sustain the grip. He learned to sit on it and ride on the hood, but eventually fell over several times. My older children can ride it at 4 and seven, but get bored with it quickly. The track is a bit small so when he is able to ride, we will need to get the expansion pack."
4,Nice item,"I've had my Sony ICF-C153V for about 5 years now. It's a nice radio/alarm clock. I've had no trouble with it. My only complaint is the same point another reviewer made: it needs battery backup. I have to say, in all the years I've had this clock radio, I haven't tried the weather alert yet. Since we now live in Georgia, I plan on giving it a try. I do hope, however, the power does not go out during an alert! Also if the power goes out, you have to redo the time, the alarm clock setting and preset radio stations, and that could be avoided if there was battery backup."
5,The Single Moms Little Book of Wisdom,"Love it! Love it! Love it! Cudos to Cassandra for having the insight and courage to write this gem of a book. Every single mother should have a copy of this book. It touches on so many important issues that I don't know where to begin. You'll learn not to beat yourself up over things that are out of your control. You'll learn how to tune out negativity from others so that you can focus on living your best life. You'll also learn what to look for and what not to look for in a mate. It's a small book that packs a big punch.What I like most about it, besides the practical information was that I felt like Cassandra was right here with me. I feel like she understood my pain and my hopes for the future."
4,A few flaws,"This pot is great for cooking most items and is really only brought down by a few flaws, outlined below:Pros:- Two drainage sizes- Two openings so straining doesn't cause steam to rise up and burn your hands- Good size for most cooking- Stainless SteelCons:- Handle on lid has no insulation (metal on metal burns you if you cook rice or steam vegetables)- Heavy Pan (not easy to strain things like pasta if you have a lot of water)drains are positioned in such a way that you don't burn yourself with steam when you strain items"
2,Don't waste your money on Wearever It WARPS. Not Good for GlassTops,"I buy most of my stuff on Amazon. So whenever I can save other people money and headaches I will do it. There is much better stainless cookware on Amazon than Wearever. I have had two sauce pots for a couple of years and both of them are Warped bad at least 1/8"" bowed up in the center. They still look fairly good but if they take forever to heat up, then you are wasting electricity and time."
5,Beautiful item,This is a beautiful saucepan. It is solid and so practical. I cannot recommend it enough.
4,Great for draining!,"I love that this pot drains water without the need for a colander. The only I do not like is that after one use, it doesn't look new anymore. I even used stainless steel cleaner. I wish it were nonstick instead. The sticker on the pot is also impossible to remove."
2,Dolfin Jammers,"Perfect when they arrived and after one use in the chlorinated YMCA pool, the front of the jammers was all pilled up. Not sure how many uses they'll get before you can see right through them. For the price, they should be a bit stronger material."
2,Thumbs down!,"Not overly strong or memorable. I'm not big into lyrics and musically sounds nothing like Carved or Children. I'm biased for that ""80's"" sound of music.."
5,The Greatest Hip Hop Album ever NO DOUBT,"Outkast is Hip Hop at it's best and SouthernPlayalistic is by far Big Boi and Dre's best album. My favorite songs include Git up Git out,Funky Ride,and Crumblin'Erb. I hope The Player and The Poet keep bringing that realness. PEACE OUT TO ALL FANS OF THE GREATEST RAP GROUP EVER."
4,not there best but better than the rest,"This album definitely changed the rap game in the early 90s.many old skool classics, a must for the kiddies"
3,Finding themselves,"While this is their only album I can do without, the country-fried debut still contains enough creativity to hint at the trail these outcasts would blaze on future releases. Some fans claim to always love this most traditional southern rap entry most, but besides for a few creatively produced tracks, a numbing standardization belies the originality this dangerous duo would come to represent."
1,"Interesting, but not accurate","The primary informant on Hopi beliefs consulted by Frank Waters was Oswald ""White Bear"" Fredericks. Oswald was married to a white woman, had been converted to Christianity, and was not a fully initiated Hopi Indian. Thus, as one might expect, many of the traditions reported in this book are inaccurate. See: McLeod, Roxie. Dreams and rumors: a history of ""Book of the Hopi"". Thesis (M.A.)--Univ. of Colorado, 1994. Pp. 330. MLA. For a more accurate version of Hopi beliefs, try ""The Fourth World of the Hopis"" by Harold Courlander."
4,I finally read this classic.,"There are moments, especially, in the ""plays"" section of this book that are moving and insightful beyond any other writer."
4,Awesome,"I had a friend claiming this was a dry ethnography writing style. However, she was incredibly wrong since it is told through a compilation of Hopi Elders. I love it; the narrative style does take some adjusting to, but it is beautifully 'told'. When reading it, I really do feel like I'm sitting inside a kiva being told the stories by the Elders themselves."
5,TOTALLY WORKS!!,"I personally followed the advise in this book and went from totally bedfast, unable to move from my neck down, to jogging. It hasbeen 25 years since I did this and I have never had a recurrence of the RA. I am careful with my diet and eat mostly rawfruits and vegetables, with appropriate whole grains, chicken, turkey, fish and occasional red meat. This book was and is aGodsend and not accepted by the mainstream medical community who were doing nothing for me. I was on every medicine available at the time with no help. If you have RA, buy this book, follow the treatment and you will be forever greatful for the Doctor's work."
1,"Awful, horrendous graphics","The graphics in this game are even worse than games that are 7 years older.There are no quicksaves or medpacks, and even on the easiest setting you'reconstantly getting killed, then you have to start over from the beginning ofthat mission. On top of all this, the game simply isn't fun. I have never writtena review before, but feel compelled to, so hopefully someone will heed this warningand not waste their money. Its not worth getting at any price."
5,Great resource book for Doodling Artists - vibrational patterns,"This is a great resource book for the Doodling Artist that specialize in computerize digital images, and vibrational patterns for inspiration. The book has patterns of basic pen and ink repeat design patterns, different spiraling effects (vibrational patterns)to simple and complex geometric shapes,and pattern with a heavy ink silhouette that appears to give a Kaleidoscope effect.The book does not show you how to do the patterns but it is a rich source of geometric patterns for the Doodling Artist.I recommend this book to anyone that likes geometric patterns.Penandink777"
4,...,"I was too lazy to drive to walmart to buy a 1 dollar comb, this one is ok. The quality seems a bit shady for the price though."
1,Pins & Needles,"This comb was to replace an older comb because of color. Sounds silly, but there was a purpose. This Ace comb when used, approximates needles when run through my hair. Perhaps my thinning hair accounts for some of this, but this comb lacks substance and for this I give it an F (as in Failure). Next time I purchase a comb it will be on site."
5,Hard to find in stores,Just what I was looking for. I just wish all Amazon stores offered the Surper Saver Shipping.
4,clustering is often subjective,"Aldenderfer provides a concise introduction to the various types of clustering methods typically used in the social sciences. If you are a researcher, you really should consult a more comprehensive text. But the current book at least offers brevity.One key finding from the methods presented here is that the clusters are often subjective. That is, by tweaking various parameters in a given clustering method, you can end up with different clusters. More advanced statistical methods might be needed to discern which agglomerations are likely to be valid associations.Also, the software described is very badly out of date. Inevitable when the book was written in 1984. Today, the latest packages can handle bigger data sets, and often have much friendly user interfaces."
2,What a disappointment . . . . .,When you read the description on the fly leaf of this novel you are totally hooked. an inside view into the lives of Stein and Toklas through the eyes of their vietnamese cook . . .this has to be a good read . . . not!! The premise was good but if you enjoy good writing this one needs some serious work. The language seems stilted and artificial at times and the incidents contrived. If you want to read something with depth and richness I recommend getting Yann Martel's Life of Pi instead.
2,Tried But Couldn't Finish,"I really, really wanted to like this book. I kept hanging in there, sure the lovely writing would finally win me over. Alas, not so. The dense writing and wandering plot were finally too much to overcome and I gave up and didn't finish. I wish now I'd waited for the library copy instead of buying it. Paris, GertrudeStein (that's funny--inside joke from the book), it could all have been so wonderful. This is, in the end, a sad book because it could have been so, so wonderful...."
2,Verbose and poorly directed,"While this book has some lovely qualities, it reminded me of a play that was well-acted, but lacked direction. The slip of a plot maintains no tension, conveys no interest and makes the reader plow through only in hopes that something will happen. (It doesn't.) I appreciated the deft descriptions of food, but the psychological aspects left me cold and unsympathetic. I liked the glimpse into Vietnamese life, though felt unenlightened by the Parisian location. The main character seems grossly unconvincing. Lush language is often verbose and superfluous. I think Ms. Truong would be greatly served by a strong editor and an inner discipline that recognizes some of the most poetic statements are the simplest. One feels she's riding the immigrant-experience wave and that the book reviews are overinflated. Still, the book does show a lot of talent. Perhaps next time, this talent will form a more cohesive whole."
4,Great Movie for kidz,The movie is mind blowing. That is it blows your mind off. A terribly pathetic movie for which i have no words.The story -- mix-up of things. In the very beginning of the movie they tell the movie is gonna be nothing other than scary-go-round around Aadi (played by alarming Shahid).Perfect for a Saturday afternoon with the kids.Watch only if you have a child/grandchild watching it with you.
5,My Uncle illustrated Dr. Goat,My favorite of his illustrated childrens books. He illustrated it for Georgianna in N.Y.C. in '49. We have lots of the original artwork for it and I have a copy of it sitting on my desk in my office at work.Glad to hear other people enjoyed it so much.Ciao
3,Comedy Is Not Long,"Funny but, too short time wise. I buy comedy dvd/cd's for family roadtrips down the highway. 40-45mins don't cut it."
5,A Priceless Gift For Fathers,"If you are looking for a way to ""tickle daddys heart"", I highly recomend this book to help you do the job! In a small amount of real quality time with your child(ren) this book allows you to explore the most facinating man that they know. From before they were born, all the way to the day you finish it, it tells the story of daddy in their eyes, Just think how much that will change in 5 or 10 years! ( Having this type of early age documentation is almost as much fun as those naked baby pictures you know you have tucked away ! ) It not only will bring a father extreme joy, a good laugh, and something to really think about, But it will also do the same for the child ""author"" that creates this priceless gift for fathers."
1,"sorry to disagree, but...","After seeing 'the Bronx' in New York I must say I have a hard time seeing them as anything other than socially retarded, image conscious, glam rock monkeys. They are not pioneers (except maybe in the same way that Elvis was a pioneer of marketing black American music as his own device). Look, all I'm trying to say is that anything valuable about this band can be found in a myriad of other sources in the genre, and along with it can come some integrity. Consider bands like SNFU, Refused, Dazzling Killmen, Hot Snakes, Shellac, Converge, and Lightning Bolt. These and many other bands can offer the same energy and aggression as `the Bronx' without all of the high fashion haircuts and expensive designer punk clothes. Besides, aren't they distributed by Island Records, the same label that put out Mariah Carey, Sum 41, Melissa Etheridge, and Bon Jovi? Very punk boys"
5,Best Metal DVD out there!!!,"I recently purchased this after I heard about 2 songs from Children of Bodom, and this definatly worth picking up if your a fan of the band, extreme metal, or some of the most talented Guitar playing skills ever seen. I've probably watched this about 4 times since I got it and it never fails to blow me away when I'm watching it. Amazing Track list on the dvd makes it a must own."
3,"Predictable like ""Scary Movie""","My wife and I both read this book and have the same view of it. It was very predictable, the characters were proclaimed to be one thing (Ellen: sceptical, cynical; Nick: ex-marine and tough) and then not act in that character. All the characters were fundamentally stupid and had to be scrunched into contrived situations from which dumb luck would extract them. The book was saved only by the portrayal of the cocaine/crack background and the settings. The characters weren't really necessary. BTW, I've read all the Sharpe, Saxon Chronicles, Aurthur, Grail Quest series as well as Copperhead and really enjoyed them. In other words, I'm a Cornwall fanboy."
4,Seductive and laid back,"Some cool downtempo tracks, sweet beats and seductive vocals, especially from Mystic on that ""Baltimore"" track. Good music to chill out to. Sit back, relax and let the music take you there..."
2,not worth the wait,"i first heard angel's ""the other side of midnight"" on a 321 comp i bought a few years back. and ive been waiting since then for her cd to drop.unfortunately, the cd was not worth the wait; only 2 tracks are killer, and the rest are so-so. i like the tone of her mixes, but i swear she uses the same hi hat pattern on every single track."
3,Over rated. Too wordy and advanced for children under 15.,"The book is nicely illustrated and the book quality is good. However, it is too advanced for children. It is over-rated I suspect due to the voices of the celebrities that are on the CD. Many pages are actually quite depressing and negative. I like more upbeat books even if there is a moral to be taught."
4,Not much to say...,"It's a pizza cutter... What can I say. The only issue I have is that the ad didn't say it was a ""larger"" wheel. They said ""standard size"" & it's not. It's a 4"" wheel."
1,cheap plastic,The arm and pin to the blade on this pizza cutter is plastic. Cutter worked well until the plastic pin broke. Buy one with a metal pin or bolt like the kitchenaid model.
3,Good,"Slightly disappointing, only shows how living together before marriage is bad and will not lead to a good marriage, if marriage at all."
5,Cool modern look. Great price!,"I absolutely love these lights. I updated my bathrooms with these for a more modern look. I specifically was looking for vanity lights that were uplights so that I would not have to see the light bulbs. I had no problems with my order. The installation was easy. These were such a great price compared to similar designs from Restoration Hardware, Pottery Barn, Crate and Barrel, etc."
4,MY REVIEW OF NATURE'S PATH HERITAGE FLAKES,"GOOD BASE TO BUILD ON. ALL IT NEEDS IS A LITTLE HONEY AND IT'S GREAT. WE ADD BANNANA OR BERRIES. STAYS CRUNCHY TILL THE END. WE GAVE SOME TO A FAMILY IN NEED, AND THEY SAID A LITTLE SWEATNER AND THEIR BOY'S, 3&5, REALLY LIKED IT."
4,GREAT CHARACTERS AND TRADITIONS,"If you don't know much about the USMC and their ""Semper Fi"" traditions, then this is a good primer that will allow you to follow along with young Marines, just like learning the Corps as they did. This is Part I of an ongoing series (five) that showcases the young Marines and the women who loved them...and it's about loyalty and the warrior-code with the Marines being the first line of defense in the Pacific. They have excelled in all our wars before, during and since the Big One. I liked Book I and will follow through with the next editions. Semper Fi!"
5,Outstanding Reading,"I have read the whole seris and am always waiting for the next book. It is a seris that lets you live through a difficult time period in our history. If you like this, I suggest you read Mr. Griffin's other great seris called Badge of Honor."
5,Excellent read (again),"First read this book when I was in the US Navy. Unfortunately, the ships library didn't have the entire series and I was only able to read the first two books. I've often wanted to revisit this series and have just finished this one. It was every bit as good as I remember it."
2,Where are the pictures,I have both the hard cover and the kindle version now and I am VERY disappointed that the pictures are all missing what's up with that?
5,Brilliant song plus mix,"Probably the best song from the album Faith/Love Will Always Win, this was always going to be a hit. With a remix that has a bit of a Max Martin/Britney sound this single's a winner!"
1,A Total Disaster!,Huge Disappointment!Awful performence and terrible recording quality make this CD a disaster. Violin sounds like someone's scratching barbed wires. My neighbor's 2nd grader plays better than that! This CD totally screws up the beauty of Enya's music....
5,Great Set of maps,If you are going to play on Route 66 you need this set of maps. I have been finding all kinds of old pieces of the Portland cement road for years now on my motorbike.
2,"OK as mini-guides, but not as real maps","These aren't super expensive, so I should have known better from the price that they weren't going to be real maps. They've got tidbits of useful information in them, so they may be worth getting for the price, but don't expect a real map. As a few others have mentioned, they are basically cartoons. They don't show miles, topography, intersecting roads, etc. If you look at them as mini-guide books or brochures, they aren't bad, but they are definitely not real maps."
2,Here it is--- Route 66.,This is not what I expected it to be. It is described as a 'Map' but it is an artists impression map of the various stages of Route66 from Chicago to Los Angeles. I suppose it would suffice to give information on the various scenic points of interest whilst travelling through the various states en-route to Los Angeles. I specifically wanted this in conjunction with a planned motorcycle tour but this could not be used effectively on a bike. Just my opinion.
4,Route 66 Map series,"purchasing this along with the 2 hand books, helps us complete the plans, we can understand each state, where to go and what to see and do along the way. I beleive this is the minimum amount of information you would need when preparing your travel. We are all looking forward to the trip."
5,Fantastic! Alongside road maps or a GPS...,"These maps are absolutely fantastic! We've just completed a trip along Route 66 (West to East) and these maps really helped us to see some fantastic spots along the way.What you get is a set of maps, one for each state you travel through, showing Route 66 and usually the nearest interstate also, with the towns labelled and little pointers with things to see and do along the way.Note: These are NOT proper road maps, you'll need a GPS or a road atlas to go with them. But these maps will help you to make the most of your trip and see what you really want to see - all those little places along the way, full of character, that are really the spirit of the ""Mother Road""."
2,A little disappointed,"From what the description of the maps were, I thought there would be a more detailed description of the route. The people that did the assembling of the map did a good job of that. It is just not as detailed as I was expecting."
5,Route 66 here we come.,These are a great bit of info if you are interested in traveling the old hwy. It shows where it was and now is. It made us think of how much time it will take to do it right. In a few years we will go and run the whole way. With out these we would have been stuck out in the dessert with no map of where to go.Great how to get there's.
3,ROUTE 66 MAPS,"The maps worked out fine, there could have been more detail re: areas of interest, but they were OK>R.A.W."
3,Bedtime Story As Sweet As Honey,"How long does it take a little bear named Bartholomew to get ready for bed? Long enough for a big gentle bear named George to finally pick him up and carry him off. The stall tactics continue in the bedroom, this time with ""giggling"" and ""wiggling"" and ""cuddling"" and ""huggling"". Author illustrator Virginia Miller wrote this after her first book about the little bear with the big name, On Your Potty, grew in popularity. She enhances her spare text (only 100 words) with illustrations outlined in wide pencil and colored with soft, earth-toned markers. Ba is now out of diapers, but does not seem to be out of his ""Terrible Two"" stage. This story is cute, but probably not our favorite Ba story. I recommend the book Bartholomew Bear, a collection of five toddler tales of the same lovable bear at a great price."
4,The Fragile Army are rocking out!,"Yet another fine release from The Polyphonic Spree. Great songs! The Championship and Light To Follow being the best.The Championship should have been a 10-15 minute classic, which I'm sure it will be live.The Polyphonic Spree are one of the best live bands going around today, and the songs from The Fragile Army are going to be an amazing addition to their live show.Come back to Australia soon!!!"
1,cd is sorry,the cd sucks. my northside rip ridaz in sac-town ain't feeling it. the b side or the c side. straight blasting on slobs and killing dirus NHGC CUZZ coming straight threw fool. YOU BRANDS DON'T WANT NO PROBLEMS WITH MY HOOD!
3,music is ok,"gang banging is lame! why throw away your life, make something of youself, and killing people is not the answer to problems, sorry gangstas. this is just music, but the people making this music live a stupid life. working at McDonalds is better than being in a gang."
5,It's good,"After reading all the reveiws on alot of web sites, and hearing about how easly it scrachtes. I decided to buy this case for it. It looks nice (you get alot of complements on its looks). And it is pretty tough. Also the screen protetor it comes with is pretty good. I would definitly reconmend this case to any one who need a case for their Nano."
3,same experience of lense breaking on older model,"I just got off the phone with customer service for an older model of this same camera. My lense also broke with little warning. In fact, I had not even dropped it (recently) but was using the zoom when it refused to retract and stopped working. Customer service handled me the exact same way that the previous reviewer described (letting me know that service would be $171). I was shopping for an upgrade instead when I came across the last review describing the exact same experience with this newer model. I probably will not go with a Sony camera if this is a persistent issue, even though I loved it when it worked (and would have given it 5 stars)! I have had my camera for less than 2 years."
4,Seems like an excellent camera.,"I've been using the camera for several days now, including during our recent monster snow storm. It is easy to get up and running. All of my pictures have been sharp and clear. The start-up manual is good and so is the user's manual. I really should give the camera, itself, 5 stars but the graphics software that accompanies the camera is a pain. It does what it wants with my pictures and doesn't allow me to do what I want. If you have XP, don't bother using the software."
2,Wouldn't buy again...,"I've had this camera for a couple of years now. I'm a novice photographer and wasn't looking for anything fancy. At first I was happy with it, but after awhile I started to really dislike the delay between snapping the picture and it actually taking. A good couple of seconds that was enough to make it very difficult to take pictures of anything moving. Also after two years of occasional use, maybe a 1-2k pictures and the lens stuck. I was able to get it to retract with some light tapping on the lens, but you can tell by the sound of it that the gearing mechanism has started to strip effectively making it a paper weight."
1,Crappy Camera & Customer Service From Sony...,"I bought this camera almost 2 years ago. At first it worked well and I was happy. Then about 6 months ago the quality of the pictures took a nosedive. Like several other reviewers, I'm having the same problem with the pictures being very dark and blurry. I went through the manual several times and did the trouble shooting steps online at Sony's website, but couldn't figure out the problem.I called Sony just last week and they had no idea what was wrong with it either. It's not under warranty so they said they would charge me $181.00 for parts/labor/shipping even though they have NO idea what the problem is! I don't see how they can give me a flat price when they have no idea if the camera can be repaired or not. On top of that cost, I would have to pay to ship the camera to them, insured of course. I told them no thanks.My camera isn't even usable. Next time, I'm going with a Nikon."
2,Sony Customer Sucks in every way!,"The camera takes good pictures as long as you have a steady hand. Some pictures come out dark and some shadows on pictures. This camera's randomly broke after about 1 year and I did not drop the camera. I bought a Sony PDA and the same thing happened to that lcd - randomly broke - has a crack across the front. Of course, Sony said it was my fault and that I must have done something to it and refused to honor the warranty on that PDA. Since the camera was out of warranty, I knew there was nothing they were going to do. So if you want a decent camera with lousy customer service to support it - go for it! But if you want a great company to support their products, look somewhere else. I am not buying anymore Sony products - I have lost the love for Sony! Beware!"
1,worst,"esham is horrible what else can i say this is not a ""5 star album"" all he does is diss eminem on this cd to try and get famous ...save your money"
2,"It was boring, yet powerfully writen","This story, Master and Man, showed great depth of peoples' minds, and a compelling ending. Although this proved well writen, it was not writen well enough for people to enjoy it. For example, I did not enjoy it, and thought it was one of the dullest books I have read. In addition to myself, my entire english class also agreed it was too dull to enjoy."
4,Bad Year Good Work,"The year 2001 was a good year for Her Space Holidays multi-instrumentalist Marc Bianci, and this was reflected on the electronic ode to his girlfriend which was the album Manic Expressive. 2002, however was a terrible one, a death in the family and the subsequent separation from his girlfriend leave The Young machines as a moving yet lyrically bitter affair. Recorded in self inflicted solitude on his laptop and driven by ever-present loops and samples wrapped in searing electronic orchestration Bianchi finds a medium through which to murmurs grievances at his ex (My Girlfriends Boyfriend) his distance from home (South Carolina) and the regrettable state of his life (The Luxury Of Loneliness). A hauntingly beautiful experience."
4,Typical Xanth by Anthony,If you enjoy the Xanth series of books then you will enjoy this book. I felt as if were better than the average Xanth tome even though I have greatly enjoyed most of the series that I have read. Creative fantasy as usual.
5,GO FOR IT CECE!! ALRIGHT!!,"CeCe has been doing this music thing for some years now, but never a dull moment. Well Alright is simply SLAMMIN'. I hope it goes multi-platinum."
4,Christmas Play,It was a hit at Church for our annual Christmas play. Quick ship time with no problems. Thanks for all the help
4,A bit outdated...,"Overall, the book would be a good addition to a home library, but when more professional responses are needed, the reader should be aware that the material is outdated. I purchased the 2003 Reprint in 2004 and it was already out of date then. Many of the resources just aren't available either to verify the information as the text uses such old resources that they are either out of print or just unavailable. One good point... it does give recognition to which is the better rendering of word usage--either the KJV or the NIV."
2,Other low opinion valid,"As another reviewer rated the book 1 star, I gave two. The example of 'the camel passing through the eye of a needle' truly has been invalidated as he pointed it and should only be described as a colloquially-accepted or fondly accepted definition- referring it to a ""gate"".The other reviewer also stated 'Oxford Companion to the Bible is a much better reference work- I own it; and agree. I thought this might be a tertiary reference (as I have two such), but I'm glad I read the reviews first! The good thing about this book, is it has and index by subject- unlike one of the books on my shelf by V. H. Matthews."
4,I am pleased,I am mostly pleased with this product. It is comfortable and seems to do the job. The cups are a bit big and it would be nice it had three rows of hooks instead of just two. But all in all I do like it. It is the most comfortable one I've worn.
3,disappointing,Wilco still has not gotten back to the sublime quality of Yankee Hotel and Summer Teeth.
3,"good, not great...","while the record has grown on me (i've had it for a few months)a bit, it's still gonna be my least favorite when it's all said and done. ""Either Way"" is a nice opener, ""Walken"" just builds and builds, and ""What Light"" will become a wilco classic. ""Shake it Off"", however, maybe the worst song Tweedy ever wrote (yea, great lyrics on that one).still one of my all-time favorite bands, still going to see them live. just don't call this album a masterpiece, because it isn't..."
2,ehhh,"are ""sky blue sky"" and ""far, far away"" the same song? i thought i was listening to being there. was it an accident that ""shake it off"" made the album? i certainly hope so. this is by far wilco's poorest showing. with the exeception of ""what light"" and ""impossible germany"" this record is garbage. all the reviewers giving this album such high praise are out of their mind."
5,wish i could give it a million stars,wow...its that good !! ... unreal .... best i have heard in a long long time...sounds like all the wilco cds put together....BUY IT NOW !!!
1,Product did not Straighten Hair,"I have very think coase hair and this product did nothing to my hair, since my hair is super long I used two kits. I followed the instructions and left the product in longer than the 25 minutes it recommends. No change in my hair. If anyone knows of a better product, please comment."
1,Just not true,"It doesn't work ! First I thought that I was doing something wrong but this is the second time I try it, and definitely doesn't work..."
4,Most enjoyable - BUT - Typos still plague this series in Kindle format,"To be fair - I am only about 1/2 way through (re)reading this book.I'm enjoying it very much. Yet another fun ""Incarnations"" book from Piers Anthony.That said - I MUST comment about the typos. The Kindle edition of this book has quite a few typos so far. It's not NEARLY as bad as the last book, but still it's not a ""clean"" scan to Kindle. Thus, my love of this series AND this book are forcing my review to suffer the loss of a star - and I'm 4-starring this book due to typo's.ATTENTION LOVERS OF KINDLE READING - We MUST get Amazon to pay attention to the scan quality of the books we're buying for our beloved reading devices.AMAZON - COME ON - As I've said in previous reviews - YOU'RE BETTER THAN THIS. PLEASE have your scanned books proof-read and properly corrected before offering them for sale.- Ron Donofero"
1,"Bad Plot, Boring Characters","Not only is this book one of the worst in this horrendous series, it makes it obvious that the book is geared toward young boys and male fantasies in general. I mean, the publishers are very smart; boys with surging hormones really don't need good prose or plot to be satisfied, just a lot of gratuitous sexual information.For example, this book contains innumerable comments about beautiful breasts. Also, the two main characters in the beginning go to this house that basically has the ability to lower people's sexual inhibitions. Throughout the book, this is pretty much what Anthony talks about. No wonder young people like this book. If you're looking for quality though, look somewhere else."
3,lack of index *really* hurts,"I've used the Perl pocket reference for years, and I almost always start at the index. The lack of an index in this book is *really* annoying. The content is great, once you find what you're looking for.A pocket reference without an index?? What were they thinking???"
5,A VERY GOOD SONG IT MADE ME CRY ON THE LAST PART I LOVE HER,IF I WAS AALIYAH I WOULD NOT LOVE HIM ANYMORE I WOULD SAY YOU ARE MY MAN BUT YOU HAVE TO GO DOWN ON YOUR DUMB WAYS.
2,Maybe it's just not for me...,"Based on The Wizard of Oz, this book has a predictable plot. Sort of. There are parallels aplenty, although some of them require a great deal of thought (and I still haven't figured out the whole traveling-through-a-brain thing). The ending is similar to Oz, but also twisted on its head -- just like the rest of Chemical Gardens.It's not the predictability that bothers me. Given the nature of the story, that's unavoidable. The biggest issue for me is the ending. I have to admit there's closure of a sort, and the denial of expectation is nicely handled. But it felt too abrupt to me. I kept asking, ""Really? That's it? But what about...?""To be fair, I have to admit I think Rinalli is a seriously messed up woman. And I mean that in the best possible way. She is creative and can obviously come up with stuff that sticks with you. In my case, it's more of a disturbed factor, but it's still sticking. It's highly probable I won't be reading any more bizarro, though."
2,boochiboy,"Over all good mix, I was surprised that the ""man"" jelly bean mixed these trax, somehow he missed out on the usual umph!Who knows! perhaps it was late one night and he was inunder pressure to finish the mix?Oh yeah! you just have to hear track 3 Cyndi Laupers rendition of Disco Inferno, you have to hear it to believe it!"
1,Not so nice,"This was very low quality and I am glad I purchased another one at the same time because I was not able to use this one. It came with one of the ""function"" keys partly torn off. I don't recommend this brand."
5,Drew's Review,"What moving stories from the Big Three, Nancy Lopez, Fred Funk and Jarrod Lyle. Everyone of them opened up and gave personal accounts that made me feel like they were in my living room. It is inspiring to hear about their love of the game, their support system, and their ability to achieve. Pearls of wisdom come through in every interview.I lent it to a friend and after he watched it, he passed it on to his brother, so I'm going to get another copy for myself."
5,A Great Book for Rituals,"I really liked this book. I have looked in many bookstores looking for a book on prayer rituals. This one was recommended by a church professional. I looked it up here, and Amazon.com had it. When I received it, it was just perfect. I am a team member for my Church, helping people to become Catholic. I organize alot of the prayer rituals for our class. I was running out of ideas. This book help by giving me fresh and new ideas. Thank you!"
4,great item,I use this all the time in the car and never have any problems with it. Wish the cord was a little longer.
4,Save your mony!!,A two year old could finish this game 5 sec.the horses look ugly and fat and the rider is so so ugly I think the horses butt look better!!but other then that it is prity fun.
4,Good Buy,"Recommended for my Basset Hound by the pet store clerk. She enjoyed this chew for approx. 6 hours. Didnt have to worry about her choking or getting large pieces as with rawhide chews. She is a very eager chewer and loves her ""Cookies"". Would recommend this for a long lasting treat."
5,It captures the imagination every child should explore.,I have known this movie since I was a child and love it just as much now at 20. It is so imaginative and exciting. It is more fantasmic than my dreams are. I hope that every child has a chance to experience the wonders this classic beholds.
4,nice readin',"its a good book...if you have read other rogue warrior books, then its repetative,predictable and slighly boring....DICK MARCINKO HAS TO FIRE UP HIS IMAGINATION A LITTLE MORE"
2,Too silly for me,"Just couldn't get into this one, way too silly. It reminded me of the skits we did in high school."
4,Very good programming examples,"I have programmed in C, C++, and C# for many years and have done 3D rendering with each. With that background, and a couple Java references lying around, I am finding this book to be very helpful, not only in the rendering areas, but also in its attention to Java user interface design and implementation issues. For a book with 'killer' in the title, I was grateful that it kept the tone much more readable than some of those other 'zen' and 'killer' programming books out there. Well worth the moolah."
4,Good stuff,"A good descriptive book about sound and graphics programming techniques that go into developing games. Significant number of references on the web mentioned for further research and to complement it. As a seasoned Java programmer other than games, I like that it's written quite clearly on the challenging topics of some chapters."
5,Nice focus on the finer details.,"I like this book because it has good details on the issues that count. For example, detailed coverage of timers including time drifting, accuracy and compensation. It has excellent coverage of different paint buffer strategies including doublebuffer and FSEM. The examples are very clear and I like the UML diagrams. This book is well rounded with details where they need to be.The only thing I didn't get much use out of was the Java3D info but the chapters still had useful info independent of Java3D.Because of this book I now have FPS accuracy including UPS to boot!"
5,Pure energy and excellant sound quality,"The most impressive thing about this cd is the pure energy and the excellant sound qauality. For a live recording, the quality is unbeatable. Uncle Teddy has also graced this live performance with some serious Tednacity. One would think that a 53 year old rock star would be slowing down or selling out...not Ted. All of the classics are here and performed with more energy and soul than was present on Double Live Gonzo. If you liked Double Live, you will love this cd. Ted's dialogue between songs says it all...he truly loves to play guitar. High points of the cd are an incredible version of Cat Scratch, and Stranglehold with an attitude. Marco Mendoza does a spitting image of St. Holmes on Hey Baby and Ted really lays into the blues riff. Enjoy!"
4,"Like the music, don't like the profanity.","The music is good but I don't understand the need for so much profanity before, after and during some of the songs. I also bought his book ""God, Guns and Rock 'N' Roll"" This is my first Ted Nugent CD. The only song I had heard before was ""Cat Scratch Fever"". This reviews replaces an earlier review that I sent after only listening to the CD once and turning it off half way through."
4,Company very responsive,"I bought this for my son at a museum gift shop. We brought it home and it worked great and was a lot of fun, but it stopped working after a few minutes. I wrote an e-mail to the company, and a real person wrote me right back, corresponded with me (over the weekend!) and agreed to send me a new adapter. I do have a feeling this will fix the problem, and it was a very refreshing to find a customer service department that was so responsive."
2,Only two bangers,"I been a fan of SPM music since '96. I ain't trying to hate on this one, but this is his weakest cd. His production and Filero's production has'nt changed since the Hustle Town cd. This is mostly freestyles from Spm and Dopehouse family and not one song really stands out. Track 15 is probably the best and 17 is good but it sounds like you're listening to a tape. Some rhymes stand out and Spm shows he can freestyle, but the beats sound weak. Spm says this album was done in two days. They should've put more work on the music before releasing this cd."
5,Great book for serious programming learner.,"If you are serious on learning Visual BASIC programming, this would be the best book with full of examples and exercises. I can't find other beginner VB book with this much depth and breadth. If you don't plan to go deep on programming, Visual BASIC Professional Step by Step may be a book for you to consider."
1,Thanks for the warning,"After reading reviews I checked it out and many are correct. This book is not for one trying to learn VB. It is hard to read, confusing, not worth the money. DON'T BUY IT!"
1,Poor Couperin!,"(les fastes de l'ancienne et grande ménestrandise)It is a pity that one the the most interesting and playful works of the barroque age should be delivered in such versions.The enormous disbalance between the left and right hands is such that sometimes what emerges is great noise,a sort of naughty confusion.The bass becomes the absolute (untamed) master.No wonder someone talks about the ""modernity"" of this approach!The music lover should listen to the ""classical"" great versions,and then,maybe,plunge into this one,likely to be considered anightmare of Mr.Couperin' s."
2,Overpriced,"I paid almost $70 for this globe, and it is probably worth about $30. The base is really cheap material and, as others have pointed out, the map doesn't line up along the equator. Also the relief isn't as pronounced as I had hoped. I am returning it."
5,Fabulous Read,"I always thought that Warren Buffet made his fortune like every other crazy stockmarket freak, i.e until I read this book. Hagstrom explains how Buffet is able to rises above the market chaos. A must read for anyone interested in investing in the stockmarket."
1,Waste of time,Go right to the heart of the matter with Graham and Dodd's Security Analysis if you want to know how Buffett started. Hagstrom's book is a poorly executed fifth grader's book report on the primary investing philosophy of Buffett. Don't waste your money here. You'll regret it. This doesn't even really scratch the surface of relevant information.
3,Decent,"The book is decent. If you really want to learn about the Buffet Way then there are better books -like ""Making of an American capitalistic"" and Essays of Buffet. This book tries to abstract the concepts and present them in an easy to read manner.The reason I give it 3 stars is - after reading ""Making of an American.."" , I found the information in this book less useful.Hagstrom does a good job of abstracting though."
1,I wish I would have recieved this book.,I ordered this book and never got it. I inquired about not getting it twice. I think I got bored with chasing it down after that.
4,you will never be warren buffet,"Forget it. You will never be Warren Buffet. Accept it. Don't invest your money in stock market speculation: invest in your business, or yourself. Even if the stock market is your business, you're probably not going to pick stocks better than a computer. Nevertheless, if you want to know how Warren Buffet made his billions, this is a good primer.This book also constantly reminds you to not get carried away: put your money in a S&P; index fund, and get back to work. Stock speculation is only profitable for insiders with nearly illegal insider information, or people who work amazingly hard at it every day (like Buffett)."
2,Nothing original or enlightening,"I don't know about Buffet's annual letters, but I have read books that talk about his style/philosophy of investing. And this book seems to do the same. It severely lacks originality and brings nothing new to the table. A high school student could summarize 10-12 books from Buffet's investment principles and do a better job than this. There are much better books in the market, I would pass on this one."
5,"Lovely, a joy to listen to.","Schepkin's playing of these works by Bach is charming, direct, and lyrical. Like Glenn Gould with heart. Volume 2 is equally lovely, the perfect pair for a waking on a clear morning or drifting off on a warm evening."
3,Watch the Format,"Although I find these films very interesting (many are on YouTube), I had to return the boxed set.These DVDs are in the PAL format for Zone 2, Europe, Middle East and Japan. The United States and Canada use NTSC, zone 1, and our standard DVD players cannot play zone 2 DVDs. You will need a DVD player that can play the PAL zone 2 format to view these DVDs."
2,Disappointing,"This player, given the cost is dissapointing for two reason. First the resume fuction doesnt work right. It constantly will reset back to the begnning of a track, making it difficult if not impossible to listen to audiobooks. 2nd, there is no ability to fast forward (scan) thru mp3 tracks. Again, it ruins spoken word mp3 tracks, which is what I wanted to use most.The games are fun to play for the 1st 5 seconds. Dissapointing, I had to sell it and now am looking for something better. Its expensive too."
3,Made in China... but what is it made of ????,"It's okay. Works okay. Feels okay in your hand ... handle is easy to grip and hold. Weight is 14 oz. Not as heavy as I would have expected. Would prefer a little more heft like the one my mother had. It is made in China. I'd like to know what the head is made of. Says it's BPA free ... okay, but what is it made of???? The finish looks like that of non-stick (toxic) coating on pans. I don't guess I'll be heating it, but material is still a concern for me. I should have researched this better before purchasing."
2,Dumbed Down Best Places Guide,"If you read Best Places: Northwest you do NOT need to buy this book, which is far inferior. Many of the same locales are covered, but the author chooses to stick to the same term throughout: ""romantic."" Seldom does she choose another adjective. It didn't inspire me to kiss my new husband any more; it angered me that I had bought a dumbed down version of the Northwest books I already have.Looking for less expensive places to have a ""romantic"" interlude in the NW? Don't look here. I don't know about the rest of the US, but my honey and I can't go to $$$ or $$$$ places.Re-write the book to include real people who want to know things we haven't already read in your other books.Don't buy it. Check it out at the library, but don't waste your hard-earned cash. And come up with true romance that doesn't cost a fortune. That should be the focus."
4,Something to fill your quality music void....,"While I am not a big ""old school metal"" fan, this album kicks booty! I bought it after getting a taste from Korn's Follow the Leader Sampler. The first time I heard it I thought, ""not my type...."" then came back to it a month later and have been playing it more and more ever since. Listen to it 3 times and you will be hooked also!"
4,"Powerful, compelling, and intriguing...A great movie!","Calista Flockhart delivers a fantastic performance in this powerful, compelling, and intriguing independent film. The brilliance of the script is really amazing. It's wonderful to see Calista in a different role than what the audience is used to seeing her in. Jane is a mesmerizing and complex character filled with all the regular human emotions taken to an even deeper depth than we have in the real life. The character is so true and emotionally open, and it's easy to feel empathetic towards her. ""Jane Doe"" is a great movie that serious-minded drama fans can really savor for all it's worth."
1,"What the Hell Is a ""Romantic Thriller""?","I think ""Jane Doe"" is supposed to be a comedy, but I'll never really know, because it's one of the few movies I did not finish watching. Obviously, Calista Flockhart made this before her ""Ally McBeal"" success--at least I hope she did! I couldn't stand it."
5,Any high school teacher or parent of adolescents. . . .,". . . should read this. Unless your kids are actually juvenile delinquents there is no way they can be more difficult than Annie and Joan, and both of them grew up to be perfectly charming and well-adjusted women."
5,FANTABULOUS!!!!!,"These rice crisps are great. I initially bought them for myself, thinking my husband wouldn't be interested in them, as he has never liked traditional rice cakes. Imagine my surprise when he tried them and loved them! He said ""why weren't these available years ago!!! Thank you so much for such a yummy, yet healthier snack. Please keep making them just the way they are."
4,Great DVD!,"I ordered this DVD the moment it came out. Daniela is very daring by putting lots of new songs on this DVD. Most artists make DVD with only greatest hits, or songs from the last album. Not Daniela !These new songs form a good mix with the well-known hits on the DVD and it is good to see that unlike other latin singers Daniela sticks to her roots ! The guest appearances of Rosario Flores, Dulce Pontes and Olodum are great, and Daniela is full with energy and passion.As not brasilian not knowing her videoclips, I had hoped that next to the live concert this DVD would also contain some clips. But ok cannot always have everything..If you ever have a chance to see this singer/dancer live on stage, be sure to be there !"
5,A one in a million singer,"sandra Wright is truly one of the most gifted blues , soul and jazz singers alive today ....one of the classiest singers around as this album reflects...a must have for any true blues lover....and if you can't find a copy of this album , get in your car , drive cross country if you have to ,go to Vermont and see her perform live.....the world should hear this woman sing!"
5,No-pull harness,"I have had great success with the Sense-ible No-Pull Harness in reducing my young Border Collie's pulling while walking. If it weren't for this harness, he would be walking me! I still need to work on walking on leash with my new furry member of our family, but until then, I can enjoy walks with him."

3,Ric Flair/Vader Match Provides Unmatched Intensity,"The world title match between Ric Flair and Vader is excellent. It is emotional and brutal. However, I felt the undercard leaves a lot to be desired."
3,Disappointed on fit,"I was disappointed with this skin because my nano doesn't quite fit in it. It hangs out a little at the bottom and it's aggravating. I also do not like the fact that the screen cover isn't glued in. It moves and or falls out any time I try to adjust the positioning of the nano, bad design flaw. It is cute and grippy but gets dirtly quickly and the belt clip is somewhat bulky. I'm much happier with the Griffin trio I purchased, which also has a belt clip.3"
5,Helped me a great deal,I was at wits end with my mother going into a nursing home and my stepdad fighting it the whole time.They got to be quite abusive making it hard for me to be there for them and this book helpedshine a new light on the situation for me. Offered many ways to deal with the problems arisingfrom dysfunctional family relationships while needing to help out but not to loose my sanityin the process.
1,Disappointing.,Too much like textbook. Examples didn't seem real or pertinent. The subject matter is too urgent to be treated this lightly. I expected answers not another opinion.
4,Recommended for both student and practicing toxicologists,"The third edition has a larger scope and is a useful upgrade from the previous edition. Beginning with descriptive statistics and using examples drawn from toxicology studies, the book covers issues and methods for inferential statistics in toxicology at an accessable level. Meta-analysis, assessment of carcinogenicity, risk assessment, and quantitative structure-activity relationships are all addressed.A strength of the book is that the interpretation of the statistics in biological context is emphasized. The biological interpretation is an example of the author leading us to follow the advice of R.W. Hamming who suggested that the purpose of computation is insight, not numbers.The third edition achieves its goal of being useful as a textbook for students and a source for practicing toxicologists."
5,an experience which touches the inner soul,"This timeless story touches the innermost parts of one's soul - a contrast between two eternal personalities, You can not read this book without reflecting on the true meaning of life. This beautifully written story could only have been inspired by God. It is destined to be a classic"
3,Tuth Description,There was no dust cover as dipicted in the photograph. The binding was broken in a couple of areas. The book is in fair condition and readable.
5,Jeff Shaara rocks,Like his dad Jeff is a fantastic researcher. His story line in the book I have just finished was marvelous. I have not had the pleasure of seeing the movie yet and if it is of the same quality as The Killer Angles that was turned into Gettysburg it will be top shelf.
4,"Long, but has many worthy moments","While this film can get boring for those of us who do not hang on every little detail that has historical accuracy, it has enough touching moments to keep you watching. To begin with, the opening credits have what could be one of the most beautiful and touching songs ever written. A stunning ballad by the lovely Mary Fahl called ""Going Home"" melts your heart. It is sure to be an Academy Award nominee for best song (or at least it should be). One can only wonder what other gems are on Ms. Fahl's new cd ""The Other Side of Time."" And more of beautiful women ... the very attractive and under utilized young actress Mira Sorvino gives a compelling performance. It is a pity we don't see more of her on screen. Jeff Daniels is a class A actor and never disappoints, and of course, Robert Duvall is always superb. Stephen Lang is the star of the show. While we may get tired of the non-stop ""God bothering"", Lang is a wildly talented actor who gives an Oscar-worthy performance."
4,civil war enthusiast,"good movie, very historical , excellent battle scenes, but, could of been a little more graphic, to make it more realistic."
3,"Good, but not as good as Gettysburg,","The battle scenes were trememdous. Stephen Lang as GeneralJackson was alright. Brian Mallon as General Hancock, wasovershadowed, this actors part was not only intregal butimportant. The 12 minute intermission was needed. I wouldrate the movie as 3 stars. There were however imperfectionshistorically only one attuned to this era would pick up.I felt that Ron Maxwell's Gettysburg had more feeling. I dohowever like the use of the actors, especially how Maxwellwas able to gather many from Gettysburg. I wish I could have seen the Antietem Battle, as this battle was pivotal. I understand it is part of a future DVD release."
1,Revisionism,"What a piece of revisionist history. The south fought for state's rights TO KEEP SLAVERY. In the end, that's what it comes down to. They were defeated and rightly so."
2,STICK TO THE HISTORY-THERE'S PLENTY THERE,"As with Gettysburg (the movie) I can't understand why anyone needs to novel-ize history that has been so well documented AS history. The Civil War, an event that sits squarely and appropriately at our nation's history, has been so well documented in photographs, journals, letters and reminiscences that a project like this one--even as ambitious as it is--falls short when compared to the history. In fact I feel that such a movie (and the book) are irreverent when compared to the actual lives that are out there to discover and rediscover in the history.Buy and watch Ken Burns' Civil War documentary. Excellently written, narrated and scored, and illustrated with period photographs--especially those of Matthew Brady--the Burns documentary continues to be the standard against which all others continue to be measured--and they all fall short."
1,Worst Civil War Film Ever,"Wow, I'm not sure 1,000 words are enough to describe the horrible injustice this movie does to Shaara's brilliant book of the same name. Perhaps they would have done better to leave Shaara out of it and named the movie ""The Tragic Tale of Stonewall Jackson"" Stephen Lang gives an excruciatingly painful performance as the brilliant Southern General, having seen some of Lang's other work I'm tempted to blame the writer's or directors for this laugher.Believe me, I am no stranger to the Civil War. I am a Cival War maniac, I take Civil War vacations, and all this movie inspired in me was a strong desire to turn it off...Historical fans spend your money on the book or get the DVD Gettysburg based on the novel ""The Killer Angels"" Its a billion times better than this piece of trash and deserving of your hard earned money..."
5,The best movie I have seen,"If I had to see one movie all year, this would be the one I would want to see. It was historically accurate and portrayed ""Stonewall"" Jackson as a very Christian man, which he was. There was no profanity in the movie which was representative of the times in the 1860's. It was unbiased and only revealed both sides of the conflict from the North and South's perspective. Although it had a 12-minute intermission, I wanted the movie to keep flowing without any interruptions. I was never bored and the battle scenes were amazing. Stephen Lang deserves to win some kind of award for his portrayal of ""Stonewall"" Jackson. He was fantastic. Terrific movie! I can't wait for the DVD to come out. I heard it is going to be 6 hours long after they add the Battle of Antietam."
4,"not as good as ""Gettysburg;"" but a good Civil War flick!","...This movie, even as it focuses on men who were fighting to preserve the enslavement of other human beings, shows them defending their homes and states. It has much less ACTION that ""Gettysburg"" and much more character studies and background of the War and battles."
1,"Beware ""# out of #"" thought this review helpful""...","People who haven't seen the film and are debating whether to buy the DVD from the reviews should beware using the ""_ out of ___ thought this review was helpful"" rating as a benchmark. I have read message boards concerning the movie that show that pro-movie, pro-confederacy types are exhorting people to deliberately sign on to this page and rate as ""helpful"" those reviews that are favorable about the movie and the whole ""the south was fighting for state's rights not slavery"" point of view the film adopts and ""unhelpful"" those reviews that criticize the film and its one-sided portrayal of the conflict, politics, etc. One comment literally was ""we're up to 125 on ____ review; let's keep signing on so it's number 1."" I guess how the reviews are placed is based on this rating so, a word to the wise, keep scrolling down through the reviews and reading all of them, favorable and unfavorable, before you make your decision."
1,Who knew The Civil War Could Be This BORING!,"I was really looking forward to this movie. The actors. The director. All the elements for a GREAT movie were there. Although the filmatographie is great, the story of the Civil War is told in such a poor fashion that it makes it a boring movie. Knowing about the Civil War helps, but not for 3 hours! You're better off picking up a show from PBS, much better and more lively."
2,A disgrace to American history,"I really enjoy watching a lot of these war movies such as Tears of the Sun and such.. I decided to to watch this movie because I remember the one before they made this one wasn't bad. From what I've heard, this was originally a 6 hr film cut down to a 3 or 4 hr film. Maybe they should have cuttin it even more with with scenes added with fillers and this movie seeming to be more about God than the Generals. On top of that, it was based mainly on one general and seemed to take a more biased favor for the South centering on General Stonewall Jackson. The acting wasn't that great either. The only reason why I gave this movie 2 stars was for the fact that it was about American history, though this movie is a disgrace to American history. Especially to a friend of mine that was a descendent of a person who served in the Civil War."
4,Loved it...need I say anymore?,"Although the movie was a bit long, I still enjoyed every minute of it. I love history and this movie was wonderfully done. Yes, it's a shame that it basically surrounds the life of Jackson, and calling it ""Gods & Generals"" was a bit off, but overall it's a well-made movie. I have not seen ""Glory"" or ""Gettysburg"" yet to compare this to, but in due time I will. I really don't care if this movie was historically correct or not, just as long as it suits it's purpose to entertain, and put some point across about the war to people who don't know. I am a music historian, and I am used to having real history twisted around for movies (ex. ""Amadues"" and ""Immortal Beloved""). You deal with it, and those movies won Oscars and are just as entertaining as this. I highly recommend the soundtrack to G&G's! Very well done!"
1,This movie was so boring,"This was one of the most boring movies I have ever seen. I actually walked out and left during the intermission. There is no plot, or if there is, it is very thinly constructed. It is basically scenes of the Civil War battles. There are no main characters that the movie focuses on. For example, in BAND OF BROTHERS, the movie is about World War II, but there were main characters that the film is about. This one had no main characters I could see. It was a poorly made movie."
2,Very slow and stodgy,"First of all, I am not a Northerner. I am pure Virginianthrough and through. But I didn't feel this movie was anygood. Even though it was told from a more Southern point ofview, it did not really lead to any major character developmentand the performances were way over the top. Not reallyvery convincing. And those terrible Virginia accents! Did theyhave a dialect coach on site? Because they really butcheredit. I'm not sure how people spoke in those days, but theydid not all sound like Reverend Bob. Note to Actors: Guideyour speech to fit your character. I was much more impressed with the accents in Gone With The Wind. Of course, apples and oranges when applied here. I think the script has too syrupy and sentimental. And.... Will the Southern accentof any type ever be done right on screen or stage??"
2,REDNECK REVIEWS ON AMAZON,"Since when did Amazon start Spotlighting redneck views in their reviews section? Especially since Pastor Lovelace's review bearly constitutes a review.Well, as long as they're printing political diatribes by Confederate anachronisms here we go...God kicked the collective Confederate rear for a reason. Anyone who feels it's a Christian's God given right to own another human being deserves an ignominious thrashing. Get over it, Pastor Lovelace, your side lost. It's over. The Yanks had God on their side. The South was saying prayers to the Devil. You want to save your heritage? Stop sleeping with your sister. If you removed the hood maybe you would see that you're related.Watching the battles in this film was like watching Hannibal Lecter eat Fruit Loops. Watch GLORY instead. At least you won't have to listen to redneck southern inbreds talk trash about Yankees. Three Cheers for the Buffalo Soldier!! Thank God I live in California where it's civilizedUNBELIEVABLE!!"
1,I wish I had mowed the grass!,"There's 4 excruciating hours I'll never get back. Most of what I wanted to say was covered by a previous reviewer, I'll add that Ted Turner's cameo drew an unexpected burst of laughter. It smacks of the same self ingratiating eliteism that eminates from John Glen's trip to space in exchange for de-railing the Thompson hearings.With acting so forced, it looked like the process caused actual pain to the actors with speaking parts, I can't figure out how William Shatner missed this one.Don't walk, run."
2,The book easily defeats the movie,"If you read Gods and Generals, you know the focus of this book revolves around the charachter development of Lee, Jackson, Hancock, and Chamberlain. In addition, a significant portion of the book addresses how the charachters came to their decision to support the Union or the Confederacy.In the movie, the charachters are bland and the background of their decisions (Particularly Lee's) was handled without creativity. Too much time was spent on the accuracy of the Period.Finally, the acting was poor and often laughable. Just read the book."
2,A pretty bad movie,"What can be said about this movie that hasn't been said before? The pro-Confederate bias is pretty standard revisionism, with plenty of talk of states' independence but almost none of slavery. The screenplay is uninspired, the acting dull, the editing haphazard, the directing doesn't really add anything of value. It includes Bruce Boxleitner. Robert Duvall and Jeff Daniels have their moments, but these are few and far between. Stonewall Jackson is flattened into a couple of shticks, which is really too bad because the book by Jeff Shaara was the only thing I've seen or read that gives him dimension and humanity.Don't bother with this movie. Instead, see 'Gettysburg' again and hope they do a much better job on 'The Last Full Measure' - if they ever make a movie of it, unlikely considering how 'Gods and Generals' flopped. I give it 2 stars because it is dull, but I reserve the 1 star rating for films that are really terrible."
1,"Banal, Pontificating, Civil War Claptrap","I walked out of a ""sneak preview"" of this movie and still felt cheated even though admission was free. I was followed by several others whose pysches were under attack by the posturing words of the Southerners. Egad! Stay away from this one, or else wear a gas mask if you insist on watching it."
5,A living history on DVD...,"Gods and Generals, like its predecessor (and 'sequel', yes you read that right) Gettysburg, brings the Civil War to life on the silver screen. Through a combination of great cinematography, authentic sets, costumes (many living historians were involved in the making of this film) and incredible acting you will feel as if you are there on the battlefields and homefronts of this country's most divisive time.The most notable asset of this movie is the masterful acting job done by Stephen Lang, who plays ""Stonewall"" Jackson. In an Oscar caliber performance (the Academy I hope will award Mr. Lang for his efforts), Lang gives us a great view of a very complex man. Lang obviously did his homework well, the strength of his acting job is clear in the fact that you forget it's Lang and believe it's Jackson on the screen. Very well done...Overall, a great Civil War movie even with some errors and omissions. One not to be missed!"
4,American history in the making,"Whilst this 'story' has a heavy lean favouring the confederacy it did portray their side of the viewpoints very well, for one who has followed the whole story from go-to-whoa it does help when the same actors from one presentation to the next represent the same commanders.....a nice touch.Keep up the good workRay"
2,So you love Gettysburg? That doesn't mean you'll love Gods and Generals.,"I really like the film Gettysburg. I can't stand Gods and Generals. In my opinion, it's flat out boring, overly romanticized, and doesn't tell one clear story. Sure, Gettysburg has a little flare for the romantic in its own way but for some reason it works. I think it's balanced better. Gods and Generals just gets carried away. There is some striking photography now and then but not enough to carry the film on its own. It also suffers from a few distressingly bad digital effects. Gettysburg was produced early enough to avoid this. I love American civil war history but still had a very hard time sitting through this entire film. Frankly, I feel that Ken Burns' civil war doc is more engaging. Still, there are those who enjoy Gods and Generals. I do not."
2,Poetry and Prayer,"I loved Gettysburg...fantastic film. I own several movies about the Civil War, and have read several books. In other words, I had expected to love this film. Instead, what I find is the story line doesn't seem to flow well, and they keep interupting it with poetry and praying. How many prayers do I need to listen to about keeping them safe and that they return? I've only managed to watch half the film because I got so bored. I then put in Gettysburg (which is just as long...I do have a long attention span) and enjoyed every minute. This is from the same director...I wish he'd done the movie the same way. I think I will give it another try. But I'm also going to use a timer and figure out how much time they wasted on poetry and prayers."
2,Script is awful but they did a solid job with battle scenes,"though I was asking 'what happened to Antietam?' just kind of skipped right over it hmmmmm. Also way too much Jackson praying and boring wives of everybody. Too bad Turner couldn't have gotten a half way decent script for all his money. Probably the best scene was the fighting in the city of Fredericksburg, that was done well."
5,One of the best movies I have ever experianced.,"The film has great cinematography, music and acting. The movie is historically accurate and was an absolute pleasure to experiance. Even though the film was long I did not notice since I was enthralled the whole time. This film will eventually become one of the classics. This is one you don't want to miss for your collection of epic films."
4,Good movie,"You know it has to be good when you study these reviews. Themajority of the one-star ratings come from Northern reviewers. Need I say anything more?One guy actually criticized the dialogue where Jackson was pointed out to his troops for ""standing like a stone wall."" Read any basic history book on the subject and you know that the lines were really spoken and it is how the man got his nickname. No doubt this reviewer is a product of the public school system.There are some worthwhile complaints about the movie. The criticisms about the overweight middle-aged combat troops is hard to deny. The complaints about the prominent role of religion in the character's lives is bogus. Christianity wasa key aspect in the lives of many of these men. You can't ignore the fact and there is nothing wrong with examining it in a movie."
3,Not as bad as you might think,"Critics have just about killed expectations for this movie. They claim that it sympathizes too much with the South, suffers from too many cliches, in dire need of editing, and blah blah.If you are a Civil War buff, you'll enjoy the attention to detail of this film. If you're a military buff, you'll enjoy the attention to war tactics. If you're a fan of the bible, you'll love this movie.Yes, this movie is too long and it does have some war cliches, but overall, I wouldn't say this was a horrible film. Think of all the movies you'll enjoy if it weren't for the constant criticism offered by critics replaying themselves over in your head"
4,Very Very Good Movie.....,I found this movie very touching and moving...For those who say it focused too much on the south....you must keep in mind this is part of a trilogy.....and you can not cover the whole movie or cause in one movie....There were very good battle scenes...nice little focus on the Irish Brigade and their heroic efforts on Mayre's Heights...along with the other Union troops...and a nice personal side of Stonewall Jackson.... Just an overall good picture about the Civil War....Watch it for yourself and make your own judgement...not from what I or others say...Oh...and take the time to watch the beginning credits....enjoy the main title song and enjoy the battle flags....it kind of gets you in the mood for the movie...
1,Obscures real moral issues,"In the 30 minutes I could take of this boring film, I saw two Blacks: both seemed very happy with life in the South. One phrase from a slave narrative I once read was ""...and then began the whippings."" Didn't see any of that in the movie, however.Regardless of what the main characters in this film allegedly believed (states rights and all that) the objective fact is that they were fighting to save slavery. IF they were fighting to defend their state AND AT THE SAME TIME were planning to free slaves, then their defense of their state would be fine. But this was not the case.Those who praise the nobility of southern leaders need to confront the ethical issue involved in holding protection of one's state as having a higher moral claim than freeing enslaved people."
1,Fantastically boring,"It is a shame that such good acting is lost in this mind-numbing, seemingly endless movie. There are not many war movies that I do not like, which is why I was so surprised that I could not stand this one; especially after all of the hype from my family about it. Avoid this movie!"
1,awful... just awful..,"I thought Gettysburg was bad.. well it was.. but this takes some beating.. Apparently the late Edward .D Wood is credited with making the worst film of all time.. well that cannot be true.. because he did not make this film or Gettysburg..the producers and directors of Clods and Generals and Gettysbeard cannot be serious.. liberties taken with fact and accuracy.. acting the level of street entertainers (Robert Duval excluded)..the curse of political correctness.. all these matters got in the way of some sort of historical representation.... but then again.. look what so called professional film makers did with the subject of Pearl Harbor.?if the trilogy is completed, then please let it be made by someone with a sense of reality.."
2,...,"Dreadfully long. Dreadfully boring. And dreadfully too detailed to the point of failing to capturing an entirety of the Civil War. In essence, it placed too much focus on a microscopic view of the lives of a few individuals and omitted a more panaromic view of a more historical perspective of the Civil War."
1,"Film Should have been Titled ""Calvin and Jackson""","The domination by the character of ""Stonewall"" Jackson and his, in the film at least, utter devotion to the predestination taught by Calvin leaves the film with no other major characters of interest. Having read the book I'd hoped for visual insight into other generals in the book who were involved in the early Civil War; but they are essentially omitted. Too bad; I believe that the war ended long after the death of Thomas Jackson and even when Jackson was alive many others, including several very interesting generals were also involved. Others seem to have become transparent; Jackson, only Jackson, is protrayed with any depth here. This may be the first DVD I return for a refund."
5,This is about using your whole self in your healing,"I chanced upon Guided Imagery by Rubin Battino in a bookstore and opened it on an impulse. I have many books on the subject and lead a weekly meditation class in which we regularly use guided imagery. This book is about a lot more than any of the other books. It has the usual suggestions for relaxation and it has many example scripts but it also focuses on coping with life and Rubin brings his own life to life in these pages. It's about coping with emotional and physical distress including cancer, end of life, hopelessness, and pain. It's about how to connect with others who are struggling. It's about rituals and ceremonies, art therapy, journaling, nutrition, laughter and much more. It's about helping people connect with themselves, with their spiritual parts, much more deeply. I recommend this book for the traveler or the guide. And I certainly know that we are all both."
4,"Interesting, Informative Examples Of Tactical Skills","This is an interesting interpretation of the familiar chess puzzle book: Schiller has chosen one instructive and illuminating chess problem from each year of the 20th century. The problems are more than just your tired ""brilliant"" examples of forced moves and queen sacrifices - they're examples of chess themes such as maintaining the initiative, converting a winning position into a won game, as well as illustrations of tactical motifs like pins, forks, etc. Some of the positions: 1949 Levenfish-Smyslov (""Smashing Finish""), 1934 Euwe-Thomas (""Prepared Brilliancy), 1999 Kasparov-Topalov. Worth taking a look at, this book will definitely entertain you and may even improve your game."
3,Proof That Lee Burridge Can Groove Too,"Two years after his premier on the Nubreed series, Lee Burridge is back for his second release under Global Underground. This time it is for the subseries 24:7.Disc 1 (day disc) has too many Rogue acid and trippy techno tracks for this reviewer's taste. I don't mind these subgenres of electronica, but a whole set of them can get annoying. Thankfully there are a couple of stellar tracks on this disc which help to balance it out. Noteably, ""Phil's Science"" by Philemon and ""Rabbit in the Moon"" by Deeper.Disc 2 (night disc) proves that Lee Burridge can get also get his groove on. This disc's track selection is much more diverse and entertaining. The set as a whole works very well. There are still frequent bursts of trippiness, but it doesn't overwhelm as in disc 1.Disc 1 gets 3/5 stars and Disc 2 gets 4/5 stars. Too bad GU doesn't offer disc 2 from Nubreed and disc 2 from 24:7 in a hybrid package! That would be a very decent compilation by Burridge."
5,Great hat for all,"Purchased this hat while visiting Australia several years ago...I still wear this hat on a weekly basis, and it still looks brand new.It maintains its shape well, and keeps it's color, even in full sunlight!I often get comments on my unique hat..... Five star rated!"
4,"Great hat, some minor issues over time","I wear this hat in all kinds of weather. It's extremely comfortable, the style is a bit of a cross between Crocodile Dundee and Indiana Jones (and I've had people call me both while wearing it). In the sun, this hat is incredible - keeps my head cool, the sweat off my face, and the sun from my eyes. In the rain, the hat does a great job of keeping my head dry.My one complaint is that after a few hours in a pretty serious downpour, the glue holding the band down started to come loose. It's only apparent if you look for it, but it has me concerned about the quality long-term. Wouldn't be a big deal except that the bag is specifically advertised as *waterproof*, it even says so on the bag the hat comes in.So yeah, love the hat, and if anything were to go wrong with it, I'd honestly probably buy another, just frustrated at the seemingly low quality adhesive used on this supposedly waterproof hat."
1,Don't waste your money!,"This shoe polisher doesn't have enough speed or power to polish shoes!!! The brush does a decent job of applying shoe polish, however the buffer pad almost comes to a stop when you try to buff out the polish. It is impossible to get a shine on your shoes using this item."
1,winterwatchman,have had nothing but problems with this so far heat set at 55 winter watchman set at 40 and keep getting calls that the light is on have tried turning up the heat and lowering temp on the unit still no luck think twice before buying this thing!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3,watch the setting,This is an ok product as long as you adjust the dial to match the actual temperature you want it to activate at. Could be off as much as 10 degrees.
1,It's just cheap junk,"I read the bad reviews, but decided that if I got one that worked out of the box, it would be fine. Nope. Mine worked for a couple weeks, then just quit. Don't buy it for any situation where your depending on it, because it will eventually fail."
1,"Not trustworthy, too many false positives","After using this for 3 weeks and having the light turn on twice when the temperature had not even fluctuated, I threw it out. What a waste of money. Honeywell must have bought this idea from someone else and put their name on it, OR they really don't care about quality products anymore."
3,Clancy is kind of Right,"I read his book on Marines and then the book on the Airborne. The problem that I have with Clancy is that he must hang out with the Public Relations officer where ever he goes. He gets the best possible answers and explanation for everything. So he is kind of right on just about everything but exactly right on just about nothing. I checked with a buddy from the Marine Corp. He had the exact reaction. Clancy should get down with the troops and find out what is really happening.I spent 4 years with the 1st Brigade at the 82nd. LGOP to us meant ""Lost Group of Paratroopers."" This was pre GPS mind you. As for the 82nd taking shots from our Legged bretheran in the 101st. Notice it is they who feel the need to denigrate the real Airborne. In the 82nd we were always too busy to worry about what the legs were doing or what they thought."
3,I jumped with the british & Tom Clancy wrote a book about it!!!,"I was stationed at Bragg in the nineties & was a paratrooper during that (cluster___) operation called operation royal (purple) dragon. The brits were a sloppy bunch of guys. Oh, the book was alright, it was nice to have a book written about something I did, especially if it is by Tom clancy (and some other guy). I was out of the service by the time this came out and having a hard time finding work, so this was a proud little moment. I doubt it would interest today's paratroops or anyone else. Anyhow, ALL THE WAY!!"
4,Solid but not the best of the series,"Once again, Clancey has presented the spearpoint of US military power in a highly detailed and readable light. An good solid book, but it didn't read quite as well as the others. Submarine was good, but not as detailed as Fighter Wing or Marine (obviously the best), and I found the editing in Airborne to be wanting (the consistent use of ""though"" at the end of a sentence should have been caught by the editor), but then again the subject of the book is so interesting and cool, who really cares about editing?"
3,"an entertaining read, with a few errors","I've spent 3 years in the 82D Airborne now. Most recently, my time has been within the 1st Brigade that Mr. Clancy writes about. This book would have been a * * * * read, except for a few errors made by the author. (we don't have any ""stop"" or ""go"" pills! yeouch! makes us sound like druggies!) I recommend this to anyone who wishes to learn about military contingency culture."
3,Serves as a snapshot,"As a book about the U.S. Army's airborne forces in the 1990s it is an OK book, but so much has happened in the last ten years that it really is dated. Realignment has changed the 82nd Airborne and some of the old airborne units in support of XVIII Airborne Corps are losing their airborne status; those slots are being realigned to Special Forces, where they are more needed and are more relevent.There are some misconceptions perpetuated by Clancy and the chapter in which he interviewed a former XVIII ABN Corps CG seems totally irrelevent in today's environment. With that being said, anyone interested in the Airborne from a historical perspective should get this book."
3,"Cool concept, but . . .","The concept was very cool, but the execution . . . not so much. Some of the frames felt so cluttered that I couldn't actually tell what was happening in them. Not good. Some of the dialogue felt like it hadn't been edited. Not good. Beyond the concept itself, I'd have to say the best thing about this graphic novel is the lettering. But that is a problem too. The lettering shouldn't steal the show. It shouldn't distract from the content of the words or the images in the frames, but this lettering did. I guess that's both a praise and a critique."
2,meh,"This cd is the epitome of mediocrity. I usually play it at about 11:30 or 12 at night when i would like to go to sleep. Dont get me wrong, its a decent cd, they play well together but its SLOW, theres not enough guitar on the cd, and the female vocalist is only good as back up, please NEVER give her a solo song again, shes not good enough to do that. John is good on the piano but I cant help but want him to pull out a guitar on this cd. Its a decent listen, but nothing memorable. They left their best song of the cd, ""A Slow Descent,"" which is about the TBS break up.If you're looking for some good piano rock, go get Something Corporate's ""North,"" event TBS new cd is better than this, atleast I dont fall asleep when I listen to it."
3,Slightly Disappointed - Inconsistent,My son has always loved these bars and we were getting a box about weekly from the grocery store. I looked them up on Amazon and was excited to see that I could essentially get a box or two free by buying a case versus the individual boxes. The problem is that many of the boxes had bars that were not the same consistancy as my son was used to and they just fell apart or had what he called syrup on them. I am not sure if they were stored differently which caused issues or what but I was very disappointed. I know my son threw numerous bars away when he had been begging to eat them up to this point. I am hoping I just got a bad case but I am not sure whether to order again. Before this experience I would have given the product 4 or 5 stars. Based on this case maybe a 2 so I averaged it.
3,Very sweet,These are good tasting tho very very sweet. To sweet for us. They are essentially a rice krispy bar with berrys.
3,"Too long, too cold, too bad","The cold, clinical, drum-machined production makes all but a few of these songs sound sterile and lifeless, which is a shame because underneath all the electronic goop there are some good ones trying to get out. It's not awful, but the guy who recorded LAYLA is nowhere to be found"
1,"Exceedingly disappointing and lacks ""fire"" of previous works","I like blues and R&B and I prefer the use of real instruments. I was very put off by the use of ""electronics"" and I could not get beyond the lack of real drumming. I listened to the CD once and gave it my 21 year old daughter who really enjoys the album. I believe ""From the Cradle"" and ""Unplugged"" are excellent examples of his talent. If I could choose one song that epitomizes Clapton guitar work, I would choose ""Crossroads"" from ""Wheels of Fire."""
2,What a Dull CD,"I am a terrific Eric Clapton fan and have every CD the man has made. Indeed, my very first record (remember those?) as a teenager was the Yardbirds For Your Love, and have been an avid fan of his for years. I have seen him live probably 20 times.This album is just terrible. It is slow, dull, uninspiring, and over-produced. ""My Father's Eyes"" is the only memorable track, and is hardly worth the purchase of this CD. Buy it used if you must."
5,New style for Eric,"I grew up with his music, since my father is a musician and listened to Eric Clapton constantly. My father loved his solo guitar licks. There's not much of those on this CD, but I love it, cause it's kind of modern pop with some guitar and all of Eric's voice. For younger people like myself, this is a great CD for winding down and relaxing."
5,Clapton's evolution,"I have every available recording Eric has put out, with the first purchase being when I was in my early teens in the mid-1960's (Yardbirds). Pilgrim is not only one of his finest, it is one of the best records ever put out by anybody. The depth is simply incredible."
3,Could have done better.,"Good album, in general. But for a Clapton album, pretty dissapointing. What happened to the blues? I think Clapton should quit hangin' out with Babyface and hook up with Johhny Lang or Kenny Wayne Sheppard. This could've been better."
4,"Good, but could have been better","I never really listened to Clapton before this CD, but since then, I have really gotten into him. When I first heard this CD, I thought, WOW!! But after hearing some of his earlier work, I began to think that maybe this wasn't so great after all. Lyrically, it is wonderful. But musically, Clapton can do better. A lot better."
5,Adults Only,"I cannot believe how many people gave this classic work one star. They swoop down like vultures to gnaw on the carrion of Eric's soul as he offers up his grief to God as music in an attempt to heal from the horrific loss of his child, Connor. These emotional mutants log on to pick at his carcass now; will they remember their callous hearts when the hand of fate comes knocking on their door? To anyone who has experienced such an emotional blow or who can use their ears and hearts to imagine the horror of it, this album is a must own; it will help form the healing scab over the wound while allowing the very real emotional pain to flow right on through, unimpeded, to join the angelic choir that stands ready to welcome any soul whose open heart chakra seeks their comfort. God Bless ya', Eric!"
2,It Was Sooo Much Better Live!,"When ever people go to a concert, they can't wait to here the old stuff, that's how I approached the Clapton ""Pilgrim"" concert, summer of 98. He started off with the first 6 songs from Pilgrim and I loved it, forget his old stuff. But when I bought the album, the songs had lost the soul and strength from the concert. Than I noticed that the songs are paced by a soulless metrinome-like drum machine. Eric, this could have been one of your best, re-record it with a live drummer and an audience, if that's what it takes to bring back those soulful, driving tunes, I heard on the night of the concert."
5,"Oh, So Soulful!",This is wonderful music. Eric Clapton sings from his heart and soul. I never get tired of this album. It should have won Album of the Year at the Grammys. I love it. You will too.
5,erics best work to date,"the first song ""pilgrim"" let me know that clapton had madea break through and he was playing and singing from deepin his soul.i have listened toeric for 35 years and have every album he played on,we must allow our music hero's room to grow and change,to keep him limited to the traditonal blues would be tomiss out on his great talent."
2,A change for Clapton.,"This is definitely a different type of Clapton music. While I like some of the new titles on this CD, most of the CD is made up of titles I did not particularly care for. My favorite is ""My Father's Eyes."""
5,You will be close to His Majesty indeed!,"It was a few years ago that I read this book! I am planning on re-reading it again soon! The author is a prolific writer and he will take you on a journey that will bring you close to His Majesty!The book is filled with depth and sensitivity, and is biblically tuned! I read another of his books years ago when I knew very little of the Christian life.. Read this book for yourself, you will be touched deeply!"
1,wasnt her 1st flukie cd bad enough?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?,why dont those who cant sing/write/play instruments just go away???the best thing i can type about her''music''is that she at least keeps her clothes on.will she soon become a stripper like mariah carey and jewel in order to boosts sales remains to be seen.my guess is she doesnt have the physical goods to pull that off either.
4,"A couple of stinkers, but an excellent album nonetheless","Now, here's an artist who hardly anyone pays attention to nowadays who put out a phenomenally well done sophomore album. I had heard one of the tracks from this CD on my friend's computer, and decided to buy the album (knowing that most likely there was going to be 1 or 2 additional songs that I would dig).Besides ""Fresh Off The Boat"" (mediocre at best), and the filler combination of tracks 7 and 8...the rest of the album really shines. The standout tracks are ""The Grass Is Green"", ""Try""---and surprisingly...two tracks which grew on me over time in a very subtle way...""Build You Up"" & ""Island of Wonder"". I really think these 4 tracks are the standout tracks (although ""Powerless"" has to be one of the catchiest and most political tracks I've ever heard...a rare feat).Overall...an album worth getting."
4,I loved it!!!,I am really surprised when people say that this CD had a low sales record. I absolutely love it. I dont have her first cd but between Folklore and Loose (also good) I prefer Folklore.
2,Almost Three Stars,"Two stars. Another Asylum movie that is short and somewhat entertaining. No nudity, and limited (if any) profanity. I wouldn't pay more than a few dollars for this movie.(Poor/fair/average/good scale used below)- Special effects are poor to good. Some effects are obvious and also slowed down, which makes them look poor.- Character explanation and development are almost nonexistent. All of the characters remain mysteries at the end of the movie.- Acting is poor to average.- Sets appear average to good.- Camera work and lighting are average to good.- Huge plot holes, nonsensical errors, etc., run throughout the movie.Sean Lawlor as Captain Nemo does what he can with the limited screen time, dialogue, and characterization. Nemo ranges from benevolent to manipulative to evil to insane. However, his origin and motivation remain mysteries.The DVD has a short behind-the-scenes feature, a short blooper reel, and a (low-volume, low-energy) commentary track."
1,Lol to the makers,"30,000 leagues beyond bad. This movie is beyond painful to watch, avoid it like the plague. It is bad on so many levels, poor Lorenzo Lamas. What happened Asylum? Was Adrian Zmed busy the weekend you filmed this?"
4,Fun Toy!!,"We just purchased this toy for our daughter when she turned 1 year old. We first tested it out at toysrus. She loved it. Have not had problems with it.Also, there is a mistake on this toy description on Amazon website. The age range for the toy is 12 months and over. It says it on the box. I don't know why it says 3 yrs and up on amazon.There is another version of this toy but it's called the ""orchestra"" version. I did not like that too much. It just had a piano for an activity. This one has much more. But I guess it all depends what your child is in to."
3,"Ponder while ""patting the puppy""","Annie Dillard's novel, Pilgrim at Tinker Creek, was not my top choice in books to read at first. We were assigned to read it in my AP English class. She seemed like another wannabe Thoreau, but my view changed after finishing her novel. She has a distinct style unlike Thoreau in his novel Walden. She has many philosophies about life and encorporates them by comparing her philosophies to nature and instinct. Her imagery is sharp and grasping. You can see what she sees, feel what she feels, and hear what she hears. She always wraps up her ideas in a full circle referring back to her previous comments on the subject so it all fits like a puzzle. Her style and diction create a great book for nature lovers and anyone with questions about things we overlook in life, like living in the present (patting the puppy). I highly reccommend this book to anyone with time on their hands and open-minded to think and ponder the possibilities."
2,"One of those ""classics"" that is a chore to read","I hate to say it but this book is really boring. The author has a fluid prose style but goes on too long on a few original ideas as if she is showing to us half-wits how pretty she can write.I did find some incidents interesting. For example, her ruminations on hiking in her local environs. But certainly a few pages would be sufficient to describe this and her thoughts. Dillard just can't seem to say anything without examining its every nuance and tiring the reader.In short, I don't particularly like or dislike this book, but I expected more from its reputation. Save this book for later, is my recommendation."
3,Pilgrim at Tinker Creek,"I want to like Annie Dillard, I really do. I think the world is a better place because Annie Dillard thinks and writes as she does. But, the bugs. Lots and lots of looking at, thinking about, and describing bugs. Some other creatures too, both larger and smaller than bugs, but mostly bugs.As much as I appreciate the conclusions Dillard draws about the natural world and the nature of God, her minute observations about critters and plants could barely hold my attention. I took pious pleasure in finishing the book, like I had done something that, while a little boring, had it's interesting moments and made me a better person - kind of like going to church."
5,Bab 5,Babylon 5 was absolutely the very best science fiction program ever to be on television. We watch it clear through once a year. Love Love Love it.
2,Disappointed,I ordered what appeared to be the 1973 issue of this season and got a much newer item. The internal packaging was very important for our purpose and the packaging did not match that of the 1973 issue.
2,"So, so",The author spends a lot of time discussing the male anatomy but not much time regarding how to select a bicycle seat. The most helpful topic is how to measure your sit bones.
4,Fine,"This pipe wrench worked well. The jaws and gears are made from steel, and the rest is painted aluminum. It's lighter than other pipe wrenches I've worked with and finished the job just the same. The teeth were little harsh on my aluminum pipe, but that was expected and was fixed after wrapping the pipe with a rag. If I needed another I would buy it again."
4,Great for Entertaining Loose Cannons,"The product per se is great, my dog loves it and can be entertained for a while with it, however, it has a strong rubber smell, even with a few washes can't take it off, but what the heck."
5,Purchased these for my friends small dog...,I purchased htis to go along with the kong tots for my friends small dog and she loves them.
4,great product,Kong has not let me down yet. Very strong/durable material and my 2 pitbulls have yet to destroy it even when I put treats inside of it. Really great for puppies when they are teething.
1,get a better 1,an XBox screen (7.2) will also work and it is much bigger for $150 the PS2 screen is 5.4 for the same price get a PS2 screen they just dont slide on the system which isn't the end of the world. If you want a screen that fits get this one but the others are easier to see. This screen is so small that it is very hard to read small print unless if your face is close to the screen. Bottomline is that the other screens are better for their value.
5,pretaluz is pure joy,"this cd is one of the gems of my collection. Waldemar Bastos incorporates elements of his history, his culture and his soul in this work. I am transported by this music."
5,A GREAT BOOK,"This book is great, explaining tons of aquarium terms in one book instead of having to check all your books for the one word you are trying to find. I collect marine aquarium books and this is one that you should have."
5,Love this seat!,"I order this to use with my adult trike and I cannot say enough about it! My 20 month old daughter loves it and cries when the bike ride is over. We have tried a rear mounted seat, as well as a trailer, and I rate this above both of those. I am able to talk to my daughter, point things out to her and just truly enjoy the experience together. I installed it myself in five minutes. I have no complaints, it is a great product and worth ever penny."
3,Don't get this if you have low handle bars.,"It is a great seat, but my bike has rather low handle bars which means that I have to lean over my child. I constantly am pressing on her head and pushing her helmet forward. I am not sure what is going to happen as she gets taller. I wish my bike had more upright handle bars. Just beware of this when buying."
2,dangerous if you're a petite mom!,"I researched soooo many child seats and wanted this one to work. It's didn't, no matter where I positioned it. I'm 5'2"" and found it impossible to ride without my legs hitting the bottom of the child seat. It was dangerous when stopping, because of insufficient room to get my legs down to hold us both up. Also, no matter how tightly my husband and I attached the seat, after a few blocks it would shift to one side -- made worse when my son fell asleep with his head leaning to one side, making it incredibly difficult to steer.I returned it after two bike rides. It's just too dangerous."
5,My 1 year old loves this!,"This seat was so easy to put on and well worth the money! My husband and I had difficulty deciding between this seat and a trailer. We went with this because of all of the good reviews, and I am so glad that we did. My 1 year old loves this seat and has since the first time he got into it. I put this seat on myself in a matter of minutes. It was too easy. This is a great product!"
5,ibert bike seat,great seat baby loves it! one bad only is that if your short or with a belly it is hard to get on and off bike! BUT still loving it!
2,Maybe good for cruising,"If you intend to get any kind of decent workout, while riding around with your kid... do not pick this bike seat! I have six bikes. Due to clearance issues, this seat would only fit on one of the six. It will probably work with most cruiser bikes. The position of the seat forces you to pedal with your knees spread out, which is ok for a while, but gets uncomfortable after 10 minutes or so. The rear mounted seats are much better IMHO."
5,We LOVE it :o),My 2 year old and I love the ibert! Fits on my Schwinn tricycle. Just make sure you get the new version with the seat cushion and updated seatbelt!
4,Great bike seat,"My 1-year-old son loves this. He totally pitched a back-arching fit when I took him out the first time. Now he puts on his own helmet (I still fasten the strap)--and this from a kid who hates hats. It does interfere a tad with the gear shifts on my bike and, being 6'2"", it also forces me to slightly widen my knees when pedaling. The primary fallout of that is I take hills in a lower gear. Overall, great product that is easy to install, solid, and that my son adores."
4,Great European Style Seat,"We really like the i-Bert bike seat. My husband and I had been all over Europe and particularly in Amsterdam, the kids rode on the front in small ""bucket-type"" seats. Rather than spending $500 on a Chariot where the kid is stuck in the back, we opted for the i-Bert.My son, 10 months, really likes it.In Austin, we get mostly, ""hey that's cool"" comments around town. It's great for a commuter bike and 2-5 miles around town. I wouldn't go on a century ride with it. The only thing that keeps it from 5 stars is that on occasion, my husband, bangs his knees."
5,Love it!,"Was concerned that this bike seat looked very bare bones and wouldn't do the job but boy was I wrong! It is very secure, sturdy, and fits my tall 18-month old perfectly! She loved it and we are biking every day this Summer! I really like the front mount allowing me to hug her, touch her, speak to her, point things out, and listen to her babble and sing as we bike along. I did not feel ANY change in balance or weight shifting, did not have any problem with my legs hitting the seat or the baby's helmet hitting me, did not have any problems switching gears or braking, etc. All in all, this item works perfectly and feels very safe. I did a lot of research on the safety of toddler bike seats (front, back and ride along types) and highly recommend this one."
4,Get one: Front Mounted Bicycle Seat,"I highly recommend the IBert Safe-T Front Mounted Child seat. I was looking for an option that would allow me to transport two children. I initially tried a trailer but my son was a little long for it. I went with the tandem attachment for him. For my 2 year old daughter I decided on the front mount bike seat. At 6'4"" I was concerned that I wouldn't have sufficient clearance but was pleasantly surprised to find that leg clearance was not an issue. Assembly was quick and my daughter LOVES it. There's sufficient space for her growth and the safety belts hold her securely in position. I do worry about bugs hitting her in the face as she yells, 'go faster daddy!"" However, I make sure she dons her sun glasses and away we go."
5,great product,"It is easy to install and when in use, it is not cumbersome at all. I am short (5'2"") so I don't have a problem with my knees hitting the seat, like some reviewers do. The bike is easy to steer even with the seat in place; the balance is good. However, this product does not fit all bikes, as other reviewers have noted. It did not fit my Schwinn mountain bike because the handlebar was not able to be raised to give the required 3/4 inch clearance on the handlebar stem (I thought I could raise the handlebar before I bought the bike seat, but when I actually tried to do this, I could not). I put the seat on a different bike instead. I bought this seat from Amazon, and it did come with the foam padding, which other reviewers stated was lacking in their seats."
2,"Wobbly, doesn't fit some bikes and has no head support for child","We really liked the concept of this seat, but it just didn't work out. For one, our bike's stem could not be raised the required 3/4 inches, so I had to move the handlebars slightly off the top of the stem. The people at our local bike shop found this terrifying.The seat wobbles and rattles a bit. It seems secure, but the feeling is unnerving. I emailed ibert and they said some people had put duct tape in to stabilize it, but why wouldn't they fix this themselves?Aside from the difficulty of getting on the bike with so little space between the child's seat and yours, the biggest reason we ended up returning it is because there's NO support for the child's head when they fall asleep. Our daughter would last about 15 minutes before she fell asleep, then it was difficult to support her head and ride at the same time.All the bike shops I went to thought that these front seats were a bad idea and now I see why."
4,Has postives and negatives,"This bike seat is unique.Positives:it does not interfere with steering, and my 30 pound toddler LOVES the ride.Negatives:I am 5'8 and on a Iron Horse and Columbia men's style bike the I-Bert is not usable unless the seat is dropped all the way to the frame. If the seat is raised one is unable to maneuver and getting on and off the bike is nearly impossible.The compromise of dropping the seat cured any issues, and riding has not been a problem hills are a little more difficult however.So far this a a good alternative to the trailer and rear sitting seats."
3,didnt feel so secure,"I read such rave reviews about this product before purchasing, but was a bit disappointed.1. Child must wear a bike helmet. The seat is not so sturdy, and if god forbid you crash into something, the baby goes flying.2. Definitely not recommended for any baby that does not hold his head. Baby must be able to sit without assistance. Seat has zero head support.3. Not safe for mountain biking.It is easy to install, but really not for major biking excursions."
4,Great for short rides,"I love this bike seat. It is great for rides around the neighborhood. Good control and center balance. Long distance has some disadvantages: kids can't sleep b/c there is no high back, you can't stradle the back when you stop without turning the wheels which throws the balance off, and the padding is ultra-thin."
5,Workin Out!,Cool to see these guys working out back in the day. everything was funner back then. Good movie worth watching.
5,Schwarzenegger's Bible,Recently when I purchased Pumping Iron I had only viewed the original up until now. After watching the special edition I was very pleased. This film has everything you can expect from a great Docu-Drama and will not let you down. From cut scenes to awesome interviews with Arnold you're definitely getting your money worth. So hurry get yours now.
5,Classic Docudrama,Its a classic docudrama that all weight lifters need to have or motivation for those who want to weight train! The anniversary edition is loaded with extra content that is worth watching.
4,Muscles or what?,"This doco-movie is a great one to watch, involving a young Arnold Schwrzenegger. Wacthing him train and pump is body is mind boggling. And then there is the young Bill bixby who is also traing to compete against Arnie and is incredibly deaf. The images of him pumping iron with his Father watching and training him is great stuff. The dedication that these men put into their training is amazing and makes for a fascinating watch. Even if you are not a huge fan of the body building industry, it is still a great doco to watch, and you won't help but feel admiration for what they do to their bodies."
5,Awsome!,"It has been a while since I watched Pumping iron. I would like to see the movie again, but I am having a hard time trying to get a hold of the video tape. I wand the tape bad!"
