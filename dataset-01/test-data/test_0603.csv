1,A Real Bummer,"CFS2 was intense and a lot of fun. Really looked forward to CFS3 but was greatly disappointed. My first impression after struggling with graphics setup was that it seem more like an update of Jane's WWII rather in the next step up in the CFS series. Flight modeles, cockpit, aircraft functionalities like trim, War Emergency power, dive brakes etc either don't work or work half as well (realistic) as CFS2. Having to relearn all the keyboard controls was a real pain also. As far as fun is concern, straffing ground target is Ok for awhile but the flak even set at low with gunners at novice will get you all the time in QC. One hit and you lose control in about a min w/ no ability to glide or crash land - just drops like a rock! I am going back to CFS2 or better yet I am going out to buy IL2 and sell my CSF3!"
5,the best game ever,this is the best game i have ever tested in my entier life. i really like it cause its got REALLY good graphics and sfx.
3,More realism than fun,"I was happy with CFS but wanted better graphics. GFS3 has the graphics if you have the iron to run it. I like to fly and blow things up or shoot at other planes. To me the game is too realistic and even on the easiest settings, it isn't as much fun as the original or European Air War. I guess I will have to wait for CFS for Wimps.To me if you are serious about sims and want a realistic experience, this is probably the one."
1,Sure enough this is not good,I did not have a good time reading this book k it was awful and sad I don't like it
4,The Hills 6 - final series,Love this reality show - this season was just as good as the others. I only wish there were more!
2,The Hills Season 6,"I was extremely disappointed with the format/presentation of my DVD. It looks like something someone has just copied and made at home - cheap, plain casing that fell apart when I opened it and no booklet inside. I'm actually wondering whether I received a legitimate copy or not? I might as well have just made myself a copy at home rather than spending money on it.Content wise, there were no special features or behind the scenes footage, just the special that was aired prior to the last episode summarising all 6 seasons. You would think that for the final season MTV would have packaged this a thousand times better."
1,Good Sleeping Pill,"I admit I haven't read most of this interminable soap opera. I always fall asleep. It is the story of a group of young men living in and around Kyle's Bed and Breakfast on Long Island, all drawn so similarly that one can't tell them apart except for very superficial tags: one is black, one Hispanic, one effeminate, one ancient (e.g., over 25). All are extremely attractive and impossibly buffed -- where do they find the time for hours at the gym, when they are either hating their buddy's new lover or falling in love with him on every second page, and endlessly dishing the rest of the time? No humor, no wit, no nothing except the extremely attractive youg men having incredibly boring conversations.Oh, and one of them is closeted to provide ""tension"" to the plotline. How do extremely handsome, extremely wealthy young men in today's New York City react to the realization that they are gay? They agonize with the internalized homophobia of a Kansas farmboy circa 1953."
2,Swallows and Amazons,"while I do like the movie and all the books the asking price here for a used copy of this movie is ridiculous. I'm not going to spend almost 900 dollars for a movie that shouldn't cost more than 40 dollars. regardless of where the movie is being sold from, an asking price of almost 900 dollars is too much for anyone to spend on a movie."
2,Didn't work for us,"This just did not work for our son. I had heard great things about it, but it kept sliding off. I tried it for about three days, but each time had the same result. I liked how it had the little flaps for each arm, it seems like that would be good for a baby who is good at escaping the swaddle. I read the instructions and feel that I was putting it on correctly, but maybe I just didn't pull tight enough. We ended up returning."
2,Up n` da sky...,"Came as described and sooner than it was supposed ! Most def will buy from this seller again ;) Game was fun but really hard to play, i thought."
5,No one writes romance like Janelle Denison!,"If you're not already a Denison fan, start saving space on your keeper shelf for this fabulous author! Bride Included is one of Denison's best to date."
4,Good story...,I have read a couple of this author's books and she never fails to entertain me and leave me with a smile after closing the book. I had one problem with the plot though...why didn't the hero and heroine talk before all the misunderstanding happened? The whole lies/rumors part was a little unbelivable. They wasted eleven years on something that was said in high school...BUT still a great book!
2,Sweet Dreams tended to drag,"Sweet DreamsSweet Dreams tended to drag. At the mid point I started to get restless and wished it was near the end. It could have had 20 minutes cut from its running time by eliminating the bed room scenes. It seemed like every few minutes she was having sex with her husband and these scenes tended to take away from the story. I felt like shouting , ""Enough already, get on with the story"" I'm not a prude but too many contemporary have this program.""Coal Miner's Daughter"" was a much better movie."
3,Cool movie if you are into Ashtanga yoga,"the film portrays Guruji's month long workshop in NYC. Right in the middle of it was Sept 11th. The film touches that pretty deeply and this gives an emotional component to it that wouldn't have been there if the workshop had taken place at any other time. some of the interviews are a little trite and pretentious, but it gives a nice up close look at Pattabhi Jois, Sharath, and the rest of his family. It also does some justice to the benifits of Ashtanga yoga. It's worth watching. I enjoyed it, but it's not something I'll watch again and again."
1,Titled improperly,"NOTE:The two books I make reference to here were purchased from Amazon.I recently bought 'Advanced Calculus' to replace one that I lost which was superior to this recently purchased Advanced Calculus book. The first chapter of this book was about 'sets'. I returned because if I wanted to read about sets I would have bought one about sets.Now about the 'Group Theory' book. A much BIGGER disappointment. Since Group Theory is based on sets it would have been very appropriate for this book to cover Sets first. No, instead it starts immediately with set concepts on the very first page as if this was a continuation of a lecture on Advance Group Theory from the day before. I'm still looking for a Group Theory book that starts at the beginning. Don't buy this book unless you were 'present in the lecture the day before'"
4,Good purchase,This dress is very pretty. I love the embroidery and it washes very well. I got a medium and the neckline was a little big but other than that it was a good fit.
4,Better than expected,"After reading some of the reviews I hestitated on buying this. I had just been diagnosed with MS. I started taking the shots (and still am) but wanted to find other things that I could do. From the reviews I thought this would be an alternative medicine bashing book but its not. It states the facts as they are and shows pros and cons, leave a lot for the reader to consider. I found this to be a well-rounded book that had good info."
3,Travel Book South Korea,We took a cruise that stopped in Korea and thus needed a travel guide book. Not all that easy to find at the local book store. This travel guide is OK but not poutstanding.It has limited information however is easy to read.
2,Not extremely helpful,"Unfortunately, I thought this book would be helpful in my adventures, too much information on the history, and too little on what areas to go to and how much things would cost! Lonely Planet is a better choice."
2,Ridiculously bad molds,"While I am having fun putting this together, it is by far the worse model I've ever seen. Every piece, no matter how small, has a vent*on it. And 19 times out of 20 its on the side that people see. For example, right in the middle of the nicely grained wood doors is this ugly circle. Even after I file down level it still looks bad.But like I said, I'm still having fun."
1,stupid game,"when i saw this game at the video store i was shocked, i didn't think they made a porno video game. Just to see whst it was like i rented it. What a waste it was boring and lame. all you do is walk around trying to get women to get naked for you and get this you can make your characters have sex, whao wait a minute what the h is going on. so i returned it and now giving it a bad review."
1,how about season 1,how about season 1..im tired of their greed!! do it right or dont do it at all!! i dont own any of the volumes 1-5 and i never will.im a huge scooby fan and would love to see these released by COMPLETE SEASONS instead of the stupid (out of order) volumes they come out with.PEOPLE IF YOU WANT COMPLETE SEASONS THEM PLEASE DONT BUY THIS.the only reason they do this is to take your money.lets force them to do it right by not buying these stupid volumes
4,Good service,"The wait time was very minimal. The product sought was used and the item I received was indeed used, however I have had no problems with the DVD. I would order from this company again. It was a pleasant shopping experience."
5,Great work of Art,"The first time I saw something from David Hamilton I was 14 years old. Since then there was always a feeling inside of me, which wants to capture the moment between innocence and adulthood. I still remember that moment, where I wasn't sure if I am a kid anymore or an adult. David Hamilton captures that moments brilliant. He takes pictures of dreams -- Dreams that are reality. Every picture he takes he takes with his heart. He knows how to capture the moments of real life."
1,David Hamilton Needs a Shoulder Operation!,Mr. Hamilton is so busy patting himself on the shoulder that nothing is done as far as PHOTOGRAPHY is concerned
4,A Collector's Must Have,"If you are a serious Bob Hope collector, you will want to add this one A.S.A.P."
3,Just OK,I am a big fan of The Clash. I can't wait for the new Joe Strummer documentary to come out. That said I watched The Ramones:The End Of the Century documentary and then this one right after. The Ramones doc was GREAT. The Clash one was just ok. I just didn't think it had enough interviews and it had annoying graphics in between each subject that were visually ok but that were left on the screen for what seemed like 30 seconds each before they began talking again.Not a great rock documentary but an ok one.
5,A Rock n Roll essential,"Don Letts former dj from the infamous Roxy in London and original rasta man to punks everywhere captures the true spirit of what The Clash were all about. The Clash perhaps more than any other rock band in history embraced the true rock n roll theory and this film is a marvelous depiction of how genuine and true The Clash were to themselves as well as their fans. From raw rock to blues, ska, gospel, reggae, dub, hip-hop & mercy beat The Clash were and forever will be the greatest rock n roll band this planet has ever seen & this film is a must see for anyone remotely interested in seeing the real deal.........what it means to be passionate about something as simple as music. If you don't like THE CLASH you don't like rock n roll."
4,Good.,"Excellent overview not only of The Clash music itself, but also good when it comes to explore the spirit of why and how the band got formed, their highs and downs. Recommended for both fans and newcomers who want to know and understand a bit more about the band's roots and about a whole era context on the recent history.Production and packaging are just a bit simple, cheap... disappointing if compared to the contents and the extras.Worth buying though."
3,A good idea if you want to start from scratch.,"This accesory seems excellent, but make sure you want to build your campaign world from the bottom. If you are currently using a world that you are happy with and plan to remain in (like Forgotten Realms or Greyhawk), this accessory will do you little good."
5,Creative Habit by Twyla Tharp addresses the nuts and bolts of creativity,"As a person pursuing a ""second career"" in the arts, I found Twyla Tharp's book the Creative Habit to be an energizing read. The most inspiring aspect of the book is the fact that someone so celebrated, accomplished and disciplined faces the same daunting obstacles and self-doubts that lesser mortals do - and on a daily basis. Her practical suggestions and articulate narrative guide for integrating creativity into one's daily habit is just what the doctor ordered for any depressed, confused artistic soul convinced that they are suffering from permanent blockage. Read it."
4,Very good.,"There are some interesting ideas in this book. I have found some of her suggestions quite useful.As a creative person, I found this book resonated with me."
1,awful for mass shipping,I have purchased from value mailers through ebay and on amazon. I have never had a problem before. I mail about 4000 packages a year. I actually sought out these bags because they were such good quality for the price. I think they changed their manufacturing. These bags are awful. You have to stick your hand in each envelope to get it open and each individual bag is stuck together. Also the labels don't stick very well to the bags. The bags are no longer a grey on the inside they are black on the inside. I wonder if they are making the bags differently now. The quality has gone down hill. I would hesitate to buy again.
4,Dont waste your money yo!,I get these clensing strips at the 99 cents store. The price of these are about the same price as the better biore version of these and i think there are 8 strips instead of three.
5,Fantastic!,"This has to be the most wonderfully relaxing music I have heard in a long time. Very soothing, a must have. Well done Brannan Lane, here's hoping there's more on the way!!"
2,Predictable,"There's no way that this movie is based on a true story. Every part of the plot was predictable. It's one of those movies where you end up screaming at the tv, yelling ""You moron!"" at the main character, who obviously hasn't watched enough horror movies and doesn't have any common sense. The best part of this movie was when it was finally over."
1,Don't waste your money!,This toy is a waste of money! The dolphins make hardly a peep when you dunk them! The only enjoyment my daughter gets out of them is to bang them together or to put them in her mouth. I am so sorry I bought this toy!
1,Such a disappointment :(,We were looking forward to this but it just does not deliver. The dolphins don't make sound reliably and the darn rings will not stay hooked together. It is going into the Christmas return pile if I can find the box among the recyclables.
1,don't waste your money,I was very disappointed with this toy. When it was put in the tub the dolphins do not make sounds like they are suppose to. The floats do not stay together and this makes my 20 mos. old very upset. They look good and are cute but not worth the money. Would not recommend.
1,"Flimsy, squeaky, and not much fun","This toy was given to our 18-month-old son by a music teacher with great intentions. However, the noises produced by the dolphins are squeaks at best and only audible when hit hard (which my little one isn't quite up to doing). Also, the ""ring"" of dolphins doesn't stay hooked even without whacking dolphins, so pretty soon there are 16 pieces of colored plastic cluttering up the tub. Definitely not worth buying."
1,I do not recommend,"Its a great toy in theory but it doesn't work. The chains do not stay link at all. I tried until I became frustrated. My son had no patience for it. They also tip over and the sounds are hard to hear. He got the most use out of it by sucking on the dolphins. I would not recommend this toy, it just doesn't work the way the manufacturer says."
1,Not worth the money,"I got this as a gift for my 1 year old. The rings don't stay together when you tap the dolphins on the head....but more importantly, to get the dolphins to make a half way audible sound you have to put far more water in the tub than is safe for a toddler. It is far too dangerous to fill the tub to that level just to get a couple of high pitched whistles out of a few plastic dolphins. SOOOO not worth it~"
4,better than reviews here,"My 2 yr old received this as a hand-me-down. I came online to get instructions. I read the reviews and then tried the toy out. I don't know if this older set is different or what but we have not had the same problems as everyone else?? The dolphins make just the right volume of noise when either bopped gently on their heads as they float in their rings or if the individual dolphin's ""booty"" is tapped on the surface of the water. If they do get water in them and won't ""whistle"" the water quickly comes out when lifted. Our rings also have stayed together if they are hooked in the correct numeric order (reward for right sequence)."
1,dissapointed,Perhaps my son is too young (he's 2 1/2)but this toy is just too much work. The dolphins don't make much sound and don't stay together well. The colors of the dolphins and the rings don't evern match up well.
2,Cute but doesn't really work,We got these for our daughter becasue she loves bath time and playing her toy piano. We figured this would be a cute toy that she would enjoy but we were wrong. You have to beat the poor dolphins to get them to play a note. And the note is more of an electronic sound...it's hard to describe it but it's NOT a musical note! And it never fails after fianlly beating the things enough to get a sound out of them the ring comes loose. It's just a total pain to use. Granted she still plays with them in the tub just we could have bought a cheap bag of plastic dolphins at the aquarium and saves 3/4 of the money we spent on this set.
3,"Not a bad toy, Not a great one","I bought this toy a little over a year ago for my daughter's first birthday. I saw it and thought it was cute and a good price, but when I took it out of the box and put it together I was very disappointed. The little rings are supposed to hook together and float in the bathtub, but all they do is fall apart. That didn't bother me though. What did bother me about them was the fact that they weren't really that fun, the tones aren't that great, and about the only educational value they have is teaching your children the color of the dolphins. My daughter does still use them in her bath, but she doesn't pay a whole lot of attention to them."
1,We were very disappointed with this toy -,"It is not really a musical toy. Only a few of the dolphins actually emit much of any tone. The rings don't connect well - trying to get them to stay in a ring is very frustrating. Seeing that they were made by Tomy, I thought they would be worth it. There is really no way to play with them out of the water, either. Pretty useless toy in and out of the water. Tomy's ball toys are much better."
1,Not worth it,"I was so excited when I first saw this toy for my 15 month old who loves music. When we first used it, I was disappointed to find out it doesn't make music or stay together. The good thing about it, my daughter loves the little dolphins and since the rings don't stay together I can put just a few in the tub and not have too much bath clutter. It is not worth it though. There are other options that would be a lot more fun. Don't waste your money!"
1,Fear this movie,"I have to agree. I got to see this movie and it's equally terrible sequel for free as I worked with a guy who knows Kangas and worked on both movies in a small way. Pull out the thesaurus entries for horrible and godawful for both! Not even the 5 second gratuitous nudity helped this one...bad writing, bad acting...just bad. The Plan 9 from Outer Space of killer clown movies, without any of Plan 9's redeeming factors...oh wait, that didn't have any either. They're just lucky the MST3K guys had already packed it in when this came out....perfect fodder for Mike and the bots."
1,Bad sign when the make up is better than the movie!!!!!,"Ok, this movie....horribly boring! Death scenes are not exciting or gory! The make-up on the face of the ""clown"" was the only cool thing. What was he trying to be, a clown who escaped from a male strip club? For god's sakes, why shirtless? AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!!!!!"
2,Bob has more laughs than this,"I've been a big Bob Newhart Show fan, and was left a bit disappointed at this box set. For me, the best of the six tapes was the last (season 6): ""Ex Con Job"" and ""Happy Trails"" (last episode). Many of the show's classic laughs are missing -- to start with, no Dr. Padvillion, no group cabin retreats and no Mr. Hurd!! Not a bad starter kit, but i'd guess the real enthusiasts would require more than this box set provides."
2,Why?,"This book is pretty meaningless. It tries to make it appear that Porter's generic strategy Differentiation is something Trout and Rivkin has discovered. It feels like a Tom Peters book, a lot of shouting, little substance, great show and disregard what has come before. Even though Trout and Rivkin has written good books before, this is not one of them.Best left on the shelf."
1,"Bizarre, incongruous and deeply unsatisfying","The first three seasons of Bramwell are wonderful! I don't know the background of what happened to the series, but the last season is different altogether. There is no continuity in the character development, new characters are inexplicably introduced, major characters disappear. There is an odd, ponderous and melodramatic new musical score. Obviously the director is totally different and doesn't care a whit for the characters and story line as they have previously developed. It is as if the familiar, beloved, layered and nuanced characters we have come to love have been replaced by zombies. If you love the series as I did, please don't watch this last season. It's very unfortunate."
5,I enjoyed Bramwell 4 more than the first 3.,"I was rather puzzled at the negative reviews concerning Bramwell 4. To me, it was the best of Bramwell, and season 1 was right behind it. As for seasons 2 and 3, I felt they were nothing more than a soap opera. Season 4 regained my interest in the series. Of course, I understand that people have different likes and dislikes. Therefore, I was compelled to encourage people to watch season 4. The struggle of soul in Eleanor is what anyone can relate to. It was well written and well performed."
4,Grammy,The characters and actors are great. I really think the main character became too self centered. But I suppose that would be typical of that particular era.
5,Great charger,"Great charger for great price. Only one out there that I found that will charge 8 AA or AAA at a time or 4 C, or D's. Don't have to set a switch to tell it what kind of batter it is either. Automatically stops charging when fully charged so don't have to worry about overcharging. Very convenient."
3,Very bulky,I ordered this item based on very positive reviews however what I failed to notice was that this is a very bulky product. I wanted to have it so that I can charge my camera battery. However when I recieved the product I realized that I cann't carry this easily with my camera as it is so bulky.I haven't used the product yet so it might be good in terms of functionality but won't be much useful to me due to its size when there are lot of compact products already available in the market.
3,Incomplete shipment,"The Battery Charger works great, however, I had thought I purchased the charger along with the D cells, C cells, and aa cells - but only the D cells and c cells came, all in seperate shipments. - The possibility does exist I misread the ad!!!Joe in TX"
1,Great Company: Just A Bad Product,Sound quality is horrible. unit is cheaply made. Ya get what ya pay for in this product! Enforcity sent me a new one after original broke in 3days.THANKS GUYS! YOUR COMPANY ROCKS! This is just a crappy product. I WILL PURCHASE THINGS FROM YOU FOLKS AGAIN! Thanks For looking out for me!
1,ONLY for the NOVICE hiker,"If you need more than half of a 90-minute video of two incredible national parks to literally have clips of two hikers on sections of trail, including not just difficult slickrock, or deep, plod-inducing loose sand, but flat, packed, kindergarten-level hiking trails, then, by all means, by this video.(And, if you do need such a video, you ought to be barred from hiking in a place like Canyonlands.)If you don't, skip this worthless piece of trash. I will also say, sight unseen, skip other ""Park BasiX"" videos by this same set of people. And, as they are also professional tour guides/outfitters in this area, skip their company as well.As well as boring with the mind- and eye-numbing fluff of two people hiking, if I heard the hackneyed phrase ""It is worth your..."" one more time, I was going to fly to Moab to strangle a couple of people."
1,nice sheets - unfortunately they were torn,"I excitedly opened the package only to find that the fitted sheet of my new 300 thread sheets was torn. It was like a knife cut right through the middle of the sheets. The sheets were so soft and smooth, with very deep pockets on the fitted sheet and generous overhang on the flat sheet, but I never got to sleep on them. However, I called the folks at Amazon customer service and they are sending me a return label and will give me a full refund. Unfortunately, they no longer have this set available. :("
4,great price,back when I brought this I couldnt find anyone to ship it. It was a gift for my god-daughter she was so happy to get it! Although whoever you used to deliver it left it right outside the apartment door
2,"Great price, ok product","I wasn't as concerned about the wrinkles as others, but I am disappointed that after just a week, the fitted sheet has little pills on it (this is before washing)."
2,Not impressed,I returned these sheets because of the color - they were too bright blue for me. And they weren't very soft either.
3,"More Comprehensive, less Expensive Alternative",Sermons of John WesleyHere is an alternative containing the formatted complete texts of John Wesley's 141 Sermons for less money.
2,Misleading Repair Manual,"This repair manual claims to have 500 pages covering all Volvo models from 1990 to 1998. It has barely 200 pages and it only gives a semblance of covering those models well. The manual gives illustrations of repair function on one model, but gives none for the other models. It uses engine repair illustrations that are not even Volvo engines. There are few illustrations of repair functions of the 960 model."
2,Not worth the price.........,"For the price and accolades, I expected this to do a better job cleaning the wheels than it does. It requires SIGNIFICANT scrubbing to remove brake dust. I clean my car almost weekly and the front wheels take a lot of work. The only advantage to this wheel cleaner is that it is safe on all types of wheels, but there are other products, such as Mothers FX wheel cleaner, that also claim to be safe on all wheels and does a much much better job removing brake dust."
5,MESMERIZING,"Sue and Jim have put out yet another great work of art with BETWEEN EARTH AND SKY. I was introduced to the music of Rhea's Obsession almost four years ago while visiting Toronto. I bought INITIATION, which is being re-released in May (buy it!!! you'll love it!). EARTH AND SKY just continues their natural evolution as artists. I especially like ""Spiritual Fear."" The way the music washes over you .... it tingles. I've listened to it so much, I'll have to buy another CD soon."
1,Not Quiet,"I was looking to replace the dissolving bumper pads I have on my cabinets and drawers and didn't realize these don't ""cushion"" they are HARD and not soft at ALL - they don't damper the sound of closing drawers - they almost make it louder. I am returning the unopened packs I purchased - what a waste after a long lead time. Another annoying item is the packaging - there are dozens of smaller plastic bags you have to open so for a task of replacing over 500 bumbers in my house this would be a huge annoyance - good thing I am returing these."
2,Potential unmet. Bad production.,"It isn't horrible. But... the song structures are a bit repetitive as is her choice of chords. The lyrics are a bit trite & elementary. While the subject matter might be familiar to all of us (love, lost love, etc) she needs to find new and more inventive was to express herself. Any possible potential here is met with bad production.I heard about her due to someone that compared her to Natalie Merchant, Sarah McLachlan and/or Tara Maclean. I do not agree.Regretfully, I can't recommend this particular recording. Hopefully, the artists will read this review and learn from it.There is a lot to be said for expressive fresh lyrics, varied song structures and style and production that enhances instead of hindering the recording."
1,CRASHED after 3 months of light use!,"I just finished moving about 225GB of data to this drive. DO NOT be fooled by the low cost! You will lose your data and never get it back! Consider the cost of replacing your data / media when this thing goes dead on you. There is NO tech support for this, and their website has no assistance at all for these sort of problems. I would be happy to get my money back at this point.The data recovery folks say it will cost $800 - $2400 to recover the data, IF they can recover it.Next time, spend for a reliable brand and avoid this junk."
3,"A double CD (comprising ""Mr. Buechner's Dream"" and ""And So It Goes"") is a mixed bag.","I've never been a DA fan or even that into Terry Taylor so take this review for what it is worth.This double CD is a mixed bag. It has some very good songs with a lot of variety on ""Mr. Buechner's Dream"", and of course it has Mr. Taylor's wit, but at 20 songs that average 2 and 1/2 minutes apiece you move from one to another so quickly that you forget that which you've heard. Still, there's quite a bit to be enjoyed among the lesser songs that are bound to get lost. You just have to make a concentrated effort to remember those better songs. The second CD, ""And So It Goes"", falls rather flat IMO. There's 13 songs here and they average 3 minutes but they miss some of the bite and charm of the winners from the first CD. So, as a whole, there's a lot ot wade through with some nuggets of goodness in there. Perhaps this time the axiom of ""sometimes too much is just too much"" applies here?"
4,Predicting Certainties,"This book is a must for anyone interested in understanding how our world is changing shape. Captured here are the opinions and views of leaders in many walks of life around the globe of what is happening to the way we live our lives. As these are people with most influence and power, Mercer postulates that they are the very ones who will bring this future about. They have already proved frighteningly accurate in their predictions concerning terrorism and the growing imbalance between the West and the rest. It is a book for opening eyes and stimulating thinking."
4,Heart Warming,"Caleb McMann is a man tortured by the memories of the car accident in which he lost his 7 year old daughter Katie. Lossing his wife was painful but she had been ill for a long time. Lossing Katie was hell and as all parents do he feels responsible and believes that if he had done one thing or the other Katie would still be alive today. No matter what he has done since Katie's death nothing has eased the pain. A news item about one family losing a son in a motorcyle accident and donating the corneas to another person prompts Caleb to search for the little girl who now has Katie's heart beating in her chest. Caleb not only finds Hannah, but also finds that Erica, Hannah's mother breathes life into his own heart. Can he get past the fact that he is looking for his Katie in Hannah or will this push Erica & Hannah further away from him? If you are not an organ donor this one really makes you think about it."
1,Not good for business use,"I planned to use this phone for a work from home business. This means a lot of conference calls. The phone lacks one feature that made it unusable for this purpose. During a conversation, if I press the 'mute' button my callers could no longer hear me - which is what I want - but, I could also no longer hear my callers. To multi task, I have to be able to hear my callers and have them not hear me. This one problem made the phone unusable for my purposes. The entire keyboard was also somewhat flimsy feeling with too much 'give' to have a solid feel for the keys."
1,Just stopped working,"Bought this in July 07, and this morning the handset was dead, would not charge.Returning it today and looking for another brand.never did like the way it dialed."
1,terrible,What was Siemens thinking the audio quality and the phone features are just not user friendly
3,Interesting Concept,"This was an interesting read at most. Platt suggests that after a ""good company"" declares some ""not so bad news"" the market overreacts and you can take advantage of the current condition. The problem is this, how does an investor determine a ""good company"" or ""not so bad news""? This would be a good book for a small time investor who only puts small amounts of research into his/her investment decisions. I can not imagine any informed investor trading with this strategy, as it is not backed with scientific research."
1,Depressiing,"The main thing this item teaches you is that everything dies, and in this case ... far too quickly! Do yourself a favor ... buy a puppy or a cat instead, they'll live longer, and you'll have a lot more fun!"
1,Watching & Waiting,"My grandaughter, filled with excitement and anticipation, poured the instant life package into the prepared water in the aquarium and nothing happened. We are still watching and waiting for some movement or growth in the tank. We are on the 5th day and see just scum on the bottom. What a disappointment to the children. The same thing happened to her little friend who is also waiting to see something in the tank. I would not recommend the product. I have 3 very disappointed children."
2,"Good fit, bad sound","The fit of these phones is fine, but the sound is below par. I should preface that I'm using them with an IPod instead of a PSP but I thought anything logitech made had to be gold. I guess I shouldn't complain about $12 headphones, you get what you pay for."
5,A perfect beach read for thinking people,"I took this book with me on a recent vacation and was blown away. First of all, this book is HOT and features some of the steamiest and smartest sex writing I've ever read. But that is just icing on the cake, for Houellebecq has written some wonderfully rounded and sympathetic characters here, and he has more than a handful of brilliant ideas about relationships, sex, culture, business, and politics. A great conversation piece, and a terrific read!"
1,toussaint l'overture i salute you,The problem with the French is...they talk a lot and have nothing to say. So much wind. The snobbery against the blacks and the anglos is weird considering the racism and lack of true culture of the French. A very stupid book and typical of the FRenchies Of Gaul.
5,A floor pump for your Camelback,This is a portable floor pump for mountain bikers. Filling a large volume tire is VERY tiring and takes a long time with a standard handheld pump.. This pump transforms into a small floor pump for on the trail repairs. It is the absolute BEST pump a mountain biker can carry in their pack if convenience trumps weight. All my riding buds who put in lots of miles carry this.
3,"Wonderful art, confusing story","Let me start by saying that Park Sang-Sun is my favourite artist, and you can see her talent by flipping through the pages of Les Bijoux.However, cramming such a detailed and immense world/story into five volumes was not a great idea.This first volume does a decent job of introducing the world of Les Bijoux, though I would say that it's a bit overwhelming and unclear at times. For a first-time reader I'd suggest reading the first TWO volumes to get a grasp on whether you want to continue or not.For fans of gorgeous men and a new style of fantasy, this series is for you. However, some might be put off by the sometimes intense violence and sexual themes. (Definitely NOT for younger readers!)note: the pictures that Amazon provides are actually from vol. 4."
3,Would the third time have been the charm?,"I purchased this set for my 22 month old daughter. I was impressed with the rate at which it was sent to me, however there was a major snag/tear in the bottom fitted sheet. I asked for a replacement and received it within 4 days. However, there was a major stain on the top sheet of the replacement set (one that was visible without even opening the package). I have asked for a refund and will now find bedding elsewhere. Had the product been in perfect/new condition, as the average consumer expects it to be, I am sure that I would have been happy with it. The fleece was very soft and the applications were cute, but I wasn't ready to take that third chance."
3,Check caller ID,"The phone rings. A voice on the other end quotes Frost ""The woods are lovely dark and deep, but I have promises to keep and miles to go before I sleep"". This triggers Soviet Manchurian Canidate killers to carry out missions programmed long ago when the cold war was hot. Enter Charles Bronson, Soviet KGB agent to save the day and prevent WWIII with his double agent femme fatal Lee Remick in a race against time to find the evil Dr. Strangelove type villian."
1,Avoid this,"The first use of this product was an utter failure. Placed it on the edge of my dutch oven and started to heat oil for frying. I watched as the oil heated up until it started to smoke. I grabbed my instant read thermometer to see what temperature it read. The Taylor unit was reading over 100 degrees less than my instant read. Thats why the oil was smoking. I wasted money on this junk, you should not do the same!"
3,This is NOT 'The Tournament'.,"I've only had a brief opportunity to view this DVD. The quality is okay. Looks like a VHS source that used a scratchy source print.This film claims to be 'The Tournament' on the box. This is not the case. Angela Mao is nowhere in the film. Neither is Whang In Sik. This film is actually known as 'Manchu Boxer' from 1974. Filmed in South Korea, it stars Lau Wing (the son from 'Big Boss') as a chinese boxer fighting in South Korea. Sammo Hung and Wilson Tong are also in this film.The fight scenes, from what I could see, are average early 70's chop socky stuff. I thought the fighting in 'When Tae Kwan Do Strikes', which is available as 'Sting of The Dragon Masters', was way better, even though both films had action direction by Sammo Hung."
2,Disappointing,"I had great hopes for this set of Beethoven's Overtures, but found it to be quite disappointing. These ""new interpretations"" are more distortions than new interpretations. Fast tempi and misplaced accents in several of the overtures spoil this set along with too reverberant sound and booming, rather than warm, bass. Karajan's set with the Berlin Philharmonic is superior in every way."
2,From Back Cover,"He could go head to head with the devil....But fortunately that wasn't going to be necessary. Because detective Jackson Ward, the New Orleans P.D.'s loose cannon - otherwise known as the chief's biggest pain the butt this side of Cabildo - was suddenly reassigned. To his home territory in Chicago. To clear the name of the chief's daughter in a murder mess so many layers deep that only someone connected could be trusted with the job....Or an Angel...When Sunni Blais was implicated in a mob-related murder, even she knew she needed some help, pronto. But how could it possibly come from the dro-dead gorgeous hunk who'd been dogging her every move since last week? Clearly, she was his target. The question was... what would he do with her once he had her?"
5,Replenish stock on magnetic playsets - create a scene,I purchased @ least 5 different titles of the magnetic playsets - create a scene playsets. Each one has given my children hours of imaginative and creative enjoyment. Without a doubt many of them are thematic in nature with pleasant graphic content. [...]
5,very compact cable,This kind of cable is very useful & compact to travel. I recommend this product to use with Treo family phones...
1,don't bother,Why anyone would put out a music dvd in the 21st century that was not in dolby digital 5.1 is beyond me. It might be because there are more breasts than music included.
4,Some good fights,"Like every event I guess, there were some boring fights, but overall, this DVD had enough big names to keep it entertaining at least. The Sakuraba fight was a little disappointing from the start, but some of the undercard fights made it worth the money - like watching Mezger, Vovchanchyn, Silva, Herring, Rodriguez, Newton, Henderson, and Yvel."
4,It is a Inspiration,"When I first poped this CD into the CD player. I was worried that it would not be a good look for Mr. 17.5. However, as the CD went on, the music got better and better. Jeezy finishes this CD at the Top of the Mountain looking over at the future of Hip-HOp. It is hard to do better than your first album, and these days it is as hard to out do your Mix Tape. Moreover, this CD is a compliment to his last Mix tape. It is not as good as his first album, but how many artist can say that their second albums were better than their first. Nas, Jay, and many others got their worst reviews on their second albums. If that is a judge of the future, then music is about to wittness a great MC take the crown of god MC. This album is good in that it seems to telling his story from his heart, rather than through the streets. His last album was what he has experianced in the street, but this album is from his heart, and yes, Atlanta is on his back. Yeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa"
5,The Inspiration,"To the haters, you and I both know that this is the realest CD you ever heard. To Jeezy fans, this is truly an inspirational CD, hence the title INSPIRATION. If this CD dont make you want to get up and do something with your life, or at least motivate you to get money then your just wasting your time on this earth....and that's real talk."
2,Young Jeezy - The Inspiration,"The Beats are tight , though Young Jeezy never switches the flow or changes the ""yeaaahhhh"" at the beginning of every SINGLE SONG (which could really get on your nerves eventually). Best song on The Inspiration was single ""I Luv It"", and ""Dreamin' (feat. Keyshia Cole) was tight because it was a little different and actually had a point to. My opinion, 2 hot songs outta 16."
3,Its Cool,Its not as good as the 1st. I expected more but its still good enough to bang in CD player.
5,Dancing With The Analysts,"Want to be enlightened about what really works on Wall Street ? Well here's your chance. Dancing With The Analysts with its intriguing premise puts you in the shoes of a first time investor who must invest successfully or lose out on a fortune. Our hero is money manager Johnny Long whose stock market system identifies the big movers in the market. Whether you're a frustrated investor or broker looking for answers, the simple truths you'll learn by reading this book will constitute a major breakthrough in your thinking and will come back to you in spades. Ten years ago, I found my Johnny Long (aka the author Dave Mallach) and regard the knowledge he was kind enough to share with me as the defining moment in my 40 plus years in the financial advisory business. Bottom line - this strategy works."
5,Such a great read..so easy to get into the mind of Driver #8,Love this book! I had just gotten into NASCAR when this book came out. It have such a good view of Dale Jr the person and driver and a candid personal view of what his life was like as the son of Dale Earnhardt. Also the trial and tribulations on his way to becoming a Cup driver.
5,Driver No. 8,"I started watching NASCAR on Fox March 2001 and am now totally devoted to this sport. This book is well-written and explains a lot of the ""inside racing"" for readers. Best of all, it feels as if ""Litte E"" is in the room talking directly to you about his racing career. You can ""almost hear his voice."" I love the book, and can reread it and reread it getting something new each time. Jade is a great advisor to Jr. because he allows Jr. to intimately share his experience with us. Dale Sr. would be proud of Jr.'s book because of it's genuine down-to-earth, no-bull representation. Buy it, you'll love it, and you'll read it over and over again."
3,Not for Beginners,"The artist and the music are excellent, but if you do not have some solid experience in the various tunings of stringed instruments, chord formations/variations, and strumming patterns, this video may not be for you. If you learn best by sitting down with someone who plays an example and then basically says, ""That's how you do it,"" then you will have no problem learning from this video. If you need very logical, stepwise, and systematically broken down instruction (as I do), then this video may do nothing more than heighten your desire to one day learn to play like the guy in the video. You may still want to buy this video, however, for, besides a few books, it is just about all I could find out there about learning to play the bouzouki (including trying to find someone who gives face-to-face lessons in my area), and I at least needed to watch someone play and hear examples of popular tunes."
5,Very impressed!,This is great maple syrup. The flavor is excellent and better than I expected. I haven't had any better maple syrup!
5,"Fast-paced, suspenseful, a page-turner.","In my opinion, in Saving Cascadia, John J. Nance has written another excellent thriller. As a professional geologist, I found his research on the Cascadia Subduction Zone to be authentic and believable. As a novelist who writes about some of the same subjects as John, both wildfire and earthquakes, I found Saving Cascadia to be a page turner - the kind you stay up with all night - fast-paced, suspenseful, brilliantly plotted, with realistically flawed characters thrown up against one challenge after another.Linda Jacobs"
1,"Okay, IF you stop reading after Chapter 40","I won't repeat the comments by other reviewers who gave this book a 1 star rating, but I agree completely with them.I was enjoying the action and story until the massive weird jolt of the story in Chapter 41. One character changed so drastically there that I went back to see if there were two authors for this book and that maybe Nance took a vacation while an intern wrote that chapter.I am truly surprised that his editor didn't force a change, or maybe she did and the mitigated result was the disaster that is Chapter 41.Anyway, Chapters 1 - 40 were exciting, fast-paced and enjoyable."
3,It's good for those mathematically inclinded.,"I read the book as it's one of set books for my MSc course. It tries to cover a lot information but without enough explaination. By the way, it may be good for those mathematically inclinded, but those without strong mathematics background could find it's difficult to read."
4,Charmed & Delighted,"Professor Egan is witty, self-deprecating, interesting, and entertaining. I particular enjoyed the research and random facts he includes about his garden, cats, St. Francis of Assisi etc...His writing style is light, descriptions vivid, and philosophy simple, yet inspiring."
4,Not too bad,"I was a little skeptical about this product when I first got it. The bottle is pretty small and I thought it would only last about a month or so. It actually lasted a little over three because you only need about 1-2 pumps, give or take. I usually used about 1 . It has green tea (hence the name) and it also has aloe vera in it among other things. This moisturizer did leave my face feeling a little bit sticky, but that didn't bother me because I usually stay up for a little bit longer after taking care of my face, so be forewarned. It is nice and light, which some people may or may not like for a nighttime moisturizer in the winter. It also didn't make my face break out or irritate it at all. This is some thing I would consider using again, but only if I couldn't find anything else that I liked more."
2,Not Enough apache,"If you are new to webservers and are trying to set yourself a windows Apache server, do not - I mean do not buy this book. It skims through the APACHE examples and gives very little assistance. It does not separate Windows from Linux so you can clearly follow what it is that you are supposed to do. It is out of date on downloading from the Apache website and leaves you with no idea if you have downloaded the correct version or not. I installed/uninstalled Apache and read the chapter many times in the hopes that had missed something. I never got it to work. I will be trying to return it although I opened the CD as a last resort and still did not find the assistance that I seeked. I am very disappointed with SAMS for allowing this book to be published. More resources should go into getting APACHE up and running. The troubleshooting is a joke - it assumes many things for a beginner."
3,An interesting compilation with some ups and downs,"I bought this recently after being very impressed with another one of Jool's Holland's albums. There is some good music on this disc although I didn't generally enjoy them all as much as those on his other disc. Some were particularly good I thought, such as ""Juice Head Blues"" and ""We shed a tear"". ""Dancing mood"" introduced a sort of reggae style to the disc but the piano arrnagement thanks to Jools Holland was very good. Track No.3 or ""I'm feeling fine"", of similar style, was pretty bad though. The style is unfortunately often very repetitive throughout the tracks, but there are some gems that save this album from doom. Generally a good job."
2,Not as advertised.,The P232 doesn't fit in it as advertised. Save your money and time. I had to return it and it was a hassel..
5,Much fun....dissappointing quality,"I have played three labyrinth games in my life, and this was by far the cheapest manufacturing. However, the game play is extremely similar. The wood is rather thin and weak, but again the game play is definitely effective. The controls are a bit sluggish compared to the others I have played, but the game is still easy enough to beat. This toy can occupy hours of mindless, yet challenging fun for adults, while providing an impressive skillful test that would improve acute hand-eye coordination for any child."
3,fun but copied,"I am 14.My friend bought me this toy for my birthday when I was 7.I thought it was great until my grandma gave me a similar toy that she has had since my mom was a child.It is called Space Tilt.I discovered that it was much better built than the one my friend had given me.It had thick would,heavy duty metal,and the dividers were nailed on instead of glued on.Labyrinth is made out of thin,cheap would and is glued together.I do not recommend buying this.I recommend mouse trap,tomy screwball scramble,or space tilt.I hope this review helped you.I hope you have a delightful time playing whatever game you choose! (:"
1,Ford Fairlane 2 would be funnier than this piece of crap!,"My husband puts out much better material than this ape like man. Jackie Martling is the real Heavyweight Champion of Comedy, he destroyed Dice on Howard's show, now Dice the pathetic creature that he is goes on the O & A show which is the comedic equivalent of FTroop! Well Hot Dogs and Donuts is the greatest comedy album of all time, buy some of my husbands CD's, I need to make another album plus he's backing this movie I wrote aptly titled, ""Divorce: Jewess Style"", it's about a woman named Allison who marries a very ugly radio personality who leaves her because he gets very famous. See you soon. Dice is a failure!"
5,Loved these Hipsters!,I liked the Hipsters style - fabric was good quality. The product can on time but they could of set it in a smaller package. Loved the colors. Wearing them make me feel good all under.
3,little tight on the thighs,"The quality is very good, relative to other brands, but not as good compared to the jockey underwear of yesteryear.However, this cut for me fits a little tight on the legs, but I'm hoping with a few extra washes it stretches a little. I've also bought the French cuts, and those are amazing."
1,Disappointing,"I bought Smash Hits 98 and I found that fairly satisfactory, although a few of the songs were not to my taste, but on the whole I enjoyed it. I was disappointed to find that on the smash Hits 99 album there were very few tracks suiting my taste and I had not even heard of some of the artists, let alone the tracks. I felt there had either been a drop in the standard of the choice of tracks or a drop in the standard of popular music as a whole for the previous year. This has now put me off from purchasing future Smash Hits albums, and this would appear to be a good thing because the standard of the choices of songs and artists to be put on the album is getting worse and the standard of the choice in the Charts is declining and the amount of poor One Hit wonders is increasing, and these appear to be the songs which are chosen to be put on the albums, not really good musicians with really good material."
1,sorry,"The most sorry of films that we have been enticed by its highly advertised hype for entertainment. This film does not deserve the time, expense and effort to bury it at a local land fillWhich Way Is Up?A.Radke"
2,Be aware,"I bought this DVD in hopes of showing it to my students. But after viewing it I cannot show it with the English subtitles because there are many words that might be offensive. In today's system it would probably be rated PG due to language which includes hell, one damn, stupid, and idiot many times. I like the fact that the creators kept the message of the Christmas story and used it within the Mexican culture. However, if you plan on showing it in a school, I would recommend informing the parents."
1,Worthless,"Was looking for a more accurate thermometer for my Weber Kettle than sticking one through the top ports. This looked ideal. Except the needle never moved, totally worthless. At $8, it's hardly worth returning, but another disappointment. Wish I would have read the review beforehand."
4,rather good than bad,"Ricci was a rather old man when recording this and you can hear it. His technique is not that sure and confident but still it's not a disgrace. It's not a downright bad recording I think. Just Ricci simply sometimes (not much,I assure you) accepts a mistake in the flow of playing rather than playing it too slow. I prefer his decision to being too ""academic"" in performance. That guy who pointed out that Ricci didn't have a microphone right at his violin fogrets how it is when you sit at the live concert. Do you have you ear 5 inches close to artist's violin? ;-)Considering that there is no other recording of all Ernst's Polyphonic studies + Wienawski's Caprices avalilable, this is the only chance to hear it."
1,One of the worst recordings ever!,"Being a violinist I will admit that the Polyphonic studies by Ernst are just about as difficult as violin music goes. But, that is no excuse to record such a poor performance of the peices. If you're looking into this CD simply for the Last Rose of Summer variation, buy the Juliette Kang recording, it is flawless."
2,"lots of pretty pictures, short of details","Along with other critics of this book, I found it lacking detail and the mantra to open your mind to new techniques tiresome. Go psycho! Yeah, whatever.Read Murphy's In Pursuit of Giant Bass instead. It is tremendously inspiring and offers endless details on seasonal patterns, rigging, colors, bait size, boat positioning, anchoring, weather patterns, etc.However, if you want to see lots of pictures of a coiffed Bill Siemantel holding big California bass, this is your book. (Does he bring a change of clothes in the boat for pictures?!)"
5,Great Information- changed my whole point of view,This book is great. I now know why my old techniques were only catching average sized bass. The theories and techniques are right on the money. The ideas and fishing techniques in this book made an immediate improvement. I would recommend this book for anybody who is tired of catching small average size bass and really wants to step up to catching lunker size fish.
2,The Boredom Beneath the Boredom,"I am not sure why Young is frequently referred to as a formal poet. He rarely writes in meter and rhyme. One of the best poems in this book, ""Cancer and Complaint at Midsummer,"" is rhymed and metrical. One wonders if he wrote more poems in meter and rhyme if maybe this would be a better book. I read this book on the recommendation of several friends, each of whom lauded Young's poetry. I now question their judgements. Young clearly knows how to write verse, but these poems are so boring. I wish to God he would simply come out and write what he wants to write instead of always hiding behind landscapes. Yes, the poems are visual, but this reader (and many others) wants more than exacting vision. Young may develop into one of our leading poets, but this work only hints that something better may come. As it stands, this is a dry, unforgiving book."
1,Muzak,"This is just awful. The arrangements make this sound more like elevator music than alternative interpretations of Michael Jackson music. I can't imagine who the audience for this is -- Michael Jackson fans and elevator music fans will likely hate it equally.So why did I buy it? I heard a big band rendition of ""Billy Jean"" in a Westin hotel in Boston and it was so bad it was funny. That rendition had a lounge lizard singer and actually took some time before you figured out what the song was -- the melody had been changed enough to make it a different song. I had hoped this was it, but it was so bad it's just bad. In fact, I tried to return it to Amazon, and they gave me my money back but didn't want me to return the CD. I guess they had sold this one copy to enough people!"
2,Eddie Vedder and those other guys in Pearl Jam,"The book started out good with biographies on Jeff and Stone but took a turn for the worst when the rest of the book was nothing but Ten, Ten, Ten and Eddie, Eddie, Eddie. The book seemed to slam on the band and Eddie in particular due to all the interviews being of a negative nature. When the author finally got done talking about Ten and Eddie Vedder's family tree around page 250 they decided to write about those other albums for the last 100 pages. I really wouldn't recommend this book."
1,an unfair and poor depiction of the band,"Any loyal Pearl Jam fan who picks up ""Five Against One"" will be extremely dissapointed. The entire book is an opinion flooded unilateral depiction of the band. ""The Pearl Jam Story"" line in the title is not warrented-- Ms. Neely is highly unfoucused and concentrates most of the book on Eddie and his past. She even had the audacity to interview and quote Mr. Vedder's step father without presenting any comment from Eddie himself. I am very dissaponted and advise you to wait till this book gets a bargain sticker slapped on it until you buy it."
5,Five Against One,"This book is awesome. Very indepth and explanatory. It spans the band's career up to the point of publishing and tells about the early life of the bands leader, Eddie Vedder. This book is very well-written and reads just like a Rolling Stone article. I highly recommend it."
2,Poor Quality,My daughter received this for her birthday. It is very poor quality graphics. She did not enjoy it at all. Don't waste your money.
3,Agreed!,Couldn't agree more with review below! Analytic philosophy almost invariably failes to grasp the uniqueness of historical philosophers; instead they seem to view the history of philosophy as a great catalogue of mistakes where theres not a whole lot to draw inspiration from. This is just sad.
2,OOPs!,"Was so excited to receive this cd, but must have received a defective one. The first two selections were not on the cd at all. Am anxiously awaiting a replacement CD and hoping it contains all selections"
3,Not quite worth the price.,"The bad: This item (along with several similar others) simply appears to be an enlargement of a vintage postcard. The quality is just not that good at 17x11. The image suffers from very obvious printer dots and is somewhat fuzzy due to the apparent enlargement. If it was scaled to the original print, or not enlarged it would not be so noticeable.The good: the paper quality is good and heavy, and while the reproduction is not that great the ink quality is good. Glad I didn't pay for the amazon.co.uk rate."
1,"Installed October 08, burnt out January 09",Title says it all. I installed these at the beginning of October 2008 and they were both burnt out by mid-January 2009 meaning I got about 4 months use out of them. I'd find another brand to buy.
2,Fun While it Lasted,"I installed Silverstar bulbs on my wife's mini van. The light was definitely whiter and brighter than the OEM bulbs. However they both failed in 11 months, within hours of each other! I still had the original package in the glove box, where I stored the OEM bulbs. It said that Sylvania guarantees your satisfaction for 12 months and references the web site. There was no info on the web site. I have come to find out that 12 months is typical for these bulbs. Well, the OEM's are back in place and I will never buy Silverstar again."
5,A Book Every American Should Read!,"This is the book for all of us looking for a clear explanation of what is really happening in Iraq, why it is happening, and what can be done about it. Journalist Trudy Rubin succinctly describes how the Bush administration's illusions got the US into this occupation, why there is an anti-American insurgency, and why reconstruction of Iraq is going so badly. ""Willful Blindness"" is a commentary on the Bush administration, but it is also a useful guide for every American no matter how the election goes in November."
5,Timely and Informative,"An excellent review of where we went wrong in Iraq, and might have avoided if we had our eyes open to available information. People looking to see which candidate might solve this problem must read this book; they will gain tremendous insight."
3,It's up and down.....,"This third book in R. Garcia Y Robertson's series, is both up and down, literarily and personally. One has to commend the author for being a MAN writing a WOMAN'S story, so the story is kind of fun in that regard. But the book was slower than the first two, and as a student of history, I know it can't end well for the main heroine. Since Edward marries her nemesis (unless the author SERIOUSLY rewrites history) I don't know how he will conclude this series, though I am still curious. I would suggest this if you are looking for an easy summer read, with more thrills than your average beach read - though history buffs beware! It's disappointing. Read Gabaldon for the drama or Penman for the history... this just falls in between and behind."
2,A Disappointment,"I absolutely adored the first two books, reveling in the adventure of Edward of March and Lady Robyn. This, however, almost seemed like it was written by a different person altogether. It is overly crass, with sex scenes that seem more gratuitous than sensual--why on Earth was it necessary to have her assistant Heidi frequently ""make out"" with Robyn? Cheap, sophmoric attempts at adventure were merely interludes between long passages of irrelevant history (which has never been the case before) and perfunctory sex scenes. The ending was deeply unsatisfying and I am woefully disappointed in this book. It is certainly not a ""heartwarming time-travel romance"" and its a travesty to compare it to anything Diana Gabaldon writes. Don't waste your time reading this, even though it is hard not to want to with the way ""Lady Robyn"" ended."
4,True to His Style,"I won't give this CD five stars because I anticipated some VERY different arrangements to the older songs...they appear to be simply remastered versions.The new songs are soulful and, as usual with Gino, own passionate lyrics. They remind me of the Slow Love CD with a bit of a modern drum feel.All and all if you're a Gino fan it's worth a listen, but don't expect any real departure from this artists zone. I for one am glad he's in that zone and will forever be a fan."
3,Uneven followup to outstanding ELIZABETH STORIES,"A couple of the stories in this new collection, including ""Sitsy"" and ""Throwing and Catching,"" are excellent, but most don't live up to the stunning power of the connected stories in her first collection, THE ELIZABETH STORIES. Check that book out first--you won't soon forget the title character ."
3,Good starting point!!,"This book is great for figuring out what topics you need to work on. I would recommend using this book and the CD-ROM first, and then using your class notes, APHA or Kaplan book to work on your weaknesses. The NAPLEX changed in 2005. This book may have been enough back then, but not anymore. STUDY TIPS: All you need is a month or less. Make sure you study brand-generics, calculations, HIV, chemo, and all major disease states (DM, HTN, etc...). The test was more hospital based than I expected, so review your rotation binders. I used this and the Kaplan book and I passed easily. Good luck!"
3,"Very interesting concept, just not enough info....","This book and the next one really leaves the reader hanging. You get no real info and it's impossible to draw any conclusions because it's just random teenage babble. I love the concept, I just wish the authors had choosed another way to present it. A first person journal wasn't the best choice..."
5,Vital and vibrant look at the OT book of Judges,"Be Available by Warren W. Wiersbe is a thoughtful study of the book of Judges. Wiersbe is probably my favorite theologian of the second half of the twentieth century. His writing is always incredibly insightful and inspiring. Be Available goes through the stories in Judges in the years after Joshua's death and before Saul became King of Israel. The Israelites were in a cycle of falling away from the Lord, facing attacks and enslavement from foreign nations, then turning back to God and a judge arising from the people who rescues them and brings peace. This cycle is repeated several times, and there are many lessons in it for Christians. Wiersbe breaks down each story and explains what God was doing in it and what it means for believers today. He even gave my heart some peace over a chapter that always troubled me: Jephthah's sacrifice of his daughter. He makes the Bible very relevant and vital with a writing style that is enjoyable and intelligent."
1,Bringing up the Rear...,"I have purchased this product, as well as, the Mvix and Tvix and this product does not compare.Cons:* The A/V cables and power cord are specifically designed for the TVisto and they are cheaply made, so if they are damaged, as with mine, you cannot purchase A/V cables off the open market.* The media folders have to be specifically organized for the TVisto or the device will not recognize the files or folders.* Unlike the Mvix and Tvix, the TVisto does not have an internal fan, so the hard drive gets extremely hot.* The Mvix and Tvix have easy access compartment for the hard drive, which does not require the removal of screws. The TVisto requires the screws be removed.* To be such an inferior product, I would have expected the price to be at least half the cost of the Mvix and Tvix.Pros:* Uuuhhh, it has a nice remote.The Mvix is the best."
1,Galaxy TVisto Review,"I purchased this unit. Sets up easily but you could only turn it off or on with the power button in the rear and the remote would not work. The internal ribbon was broken. They were very nice and i returned it ( on my dime) When I recived the new one the very same thing happened to it. Again I returned it (on my dime again)They were very nice and gave me credit but as much as I thought this would be very useful, I did not get another one. I will try to get a MacArthur Tvisto if I can and try that.Mv"
2,Shallow and disappointing,"The author had a good idea - taking a trip to sports places and writing about them, but this book is very superficial. He spends more time talking about himself and his family than any single thing he saw on the trip."
5,A great read from a great writer.,"Rushin has a wonderfully engaging style (his SI ""Point After"" column ""Just Tell It Like It Is"" from a few years back is the funniest thing I've ever read). Now, with ""Road Swing,"" I was rereading paragraphs just to marvel at his sentence construction. As a rule, I wait for the paperback, but not with ""Road Swing."" Splurge on Rushin!"
2,Expensive toy for the amount of crafting materials,"I purchased this box of crafts for my daughter for a Christmas gift was was pretty disappointed in how much I paid and how little I received. In the box was four small votive candle holders in various shapes, several bags of waxy covered sand and some small birthday candles plus instructions. For the amount of money I paid for this 'craft kit' I could have purchased MUCH more. I can get votive candle holders at the Dollar Store, shave wax from crayons, and bought a box of birthday candles at the grocery store for the price of $5.00 or less. The money I spent on this kit was a complete waste in my opinion."
2,Powdered wax is a bad idea,"My daughter received not one but two of these kits for birthday gifts. They held her attention just about long enough for her to figure out that she was never going to get something that actually looks like a candle. The powdered wax is, I suppose, a safer alternative to melting wax in a double boiler but these things just DON'T resemble real candles at all. Besides, the wax powder is quite sticky, gets everywhere, doesn't stay in the glass candle holders, and burns unevenly. I'm afraid this is one of those examples of something which looks like fun just because it's in a ""kit"", but the stuff inside is pretty cheap. I'd recommend buying real candle-making supplies and just have parental supervision when heating the wax..this kit labeled ""ages 9 and up"", and most kids that age can use the stove easily when supervised."
3,"Fit is perfect, but belt clip sucks.","I like the flexskin so much for fit and feel that I went back and bought the no-clip version because the belt clip sucks. Whenever my phone rang it was a race to try to get it unclipped before it rolled to voice mail. (May be the nature of the beast with a flexible cover.) I love the clipless one for use, but often don't know where to put it when not on the phone."
1,don't stupid,"how to say that, I paid about 70 dollars for this version,but I just found the hardcover version only need 60 dollars at the same shop(amazon).BTW, I found that this version is internation version after I reveived it. -_-!! the international version only need 40 dollars at other web site.so I would suggest buy the hardcover version!!!"
5,The best help I have ever found,"Dr. Gibbons lays out the causes and effects of I.B.S. He gives his own medical history that has effected him and how it lead him to find answer on how to best help himself. I have read the book and now follow his diet that he has explained what one needs to do to get immediate relief. I feel so much better now I can not believe the difference. Anyone who suffers with crohn's disease, celiac sprue, colitis, diverticulosis, galactosemia, infant colic, post-colostomy colitis, ulcerative colitis will benefit from this book. There are so many area's that are symptoms of I.B.S that I never even realized. My doctor was unsure at first when I started this diet, but he has seen the results and now believes, but more importantly, I feel great."
3,wish it worked better,"I got this as a gift for my 8yo daughter to help her with her handwriting based on its description. Unfortunately she hasn't been using it as she says it doesn't recognize when she's trying to write on it per the screen. I haven't tried it yet, but as my 3yo loves playing with big sister's Pixter I'm going to have him try it soon."
4,Love the length,"Im using it to place several ground pigtails into already sheetrocked and mudded jboxes,,working great and the length helps. I cant wait to work a live panel and install a breaker onto the buss and not have to worry about it slip off. The square drive head holds the screw on tight and doesnt fall off."
3,Not the egg.,"This is a very good rocking album by shiner yet does not live up to the quality of other shiner releases that i've heard, the egg is the album for quality shiner however starless is also a pretty sweet release though fairly average in comparison with alot of other alternative releases and shiner releases, i picked up the egg out of chance at a record store having heard good things about the band and was literally blown away due to the lucid content and the way the album sounded better after every listen although i've rated this 3 stars it's due to it been average but it's still alot better than most the music that breathes today."
5,Great for competitive swimming,"I've always used these GCG swim goggles during my high school career and I continue to do so to this day.They are well built and straps last for years in my experience. I recommend this goggle for anyone, competitive and not.Overall, you really can't go wrong with these goggles."
3,3 stars1/2 by considering the Oliver's taste for the epic,"Well I don't wanna give the top score to this concept work- based on Lewis Carroll's Jabberwocky- because for me this cast of stars and less famous musicians too, is ""underemployed"". Rick Wakeman is a narrator here, nevertheless his son Oliver shows a certain taste and a good tecnique as well, during his solos at the mini-moog and the other analogic synths...instead Clive Nolan keeps on duplicating his own style, typical of bands such as Pendragon, Shadowland and Arena, which are not so much interesting in my opinion! Anyway the cast of vocalists is good and the output is a range of classic rock which is new-progressive wave oriented, but with a modern touch.Diverse new-prog work, not suggested to the lovers of the complex symphonic neoclassic prog genre !!"
1,Where's The Bloopers?????,"Nothing new here......snippets of ""The Real World You Never Saw"" from the previous seasons.....I Want My [money] back!!!!"
2,Only 6 months,"Worked fine, although I doubted the accuracy at times. Then the probe went, changed battteries and all. Went to Taylor website and used the e-mail inquiry to request a new probe or info on how to buy one. No answer. My conclusion, a waste of money on the product of a who gives a crap company. Never again."
1,Important for scholars of Marx -- but HORRIBLE edition,This edition is of very poor quality. The typeface changes by the chapter; the footnote symbols do not correspond to any actual footnotes; there is no introduction; and there is no named translator.Clearly Prometheus Books simply copies-and-pastes existing versions of texts without any editorial oversight. This is a truly awful publishing company.
2,SADLY DISAPPOINTED,"I ALREADY OWN THE LARGE SCHOLASTIC COLLECTION, AND ASSUMED THIS SMALLER ONE WOULD HAVE NEW MATERIAL. BUT SOME OF THE STORIES ARE REPEATED, THAT IS, DUPLICATED. AND SOME OF THEM ARE PRETTY LAME BY TODAY'S STANDARDS. MIGHT HAVE BEEN ACCEPTABLE IN THE FIFTIES. I'M SADLY DISAPPOINTED. ALSO AT THE MARKETING, WHICH DOES NOT INCLUDE A LIST OF CONTENTS. HOW ARE WE SUPPOSED TO KNOW WHAT IS INCLUDED AND NOT INCLUDED? STILL AM LOOKING FOR THE MISSING PIECES IN THE SCHOLASTIC VIDEOS OWN PROMO THAT BEGINS EVERY DISC FROM THE LARGER COLLECTION. SEVERAL CHARACTERS FROM THAT ARE NOT PART OF THAT SET. WHERE ARE THEY? MM CARSON"
2,Not the Best,"I gave this bible 2 stars because it is the ""official"" translation used at Mass in the USA. And that's the only reason. The notes definitely are mild historical/critical in nature with no ""life application"" (How does this verse, passage, book help me to live for God). It is typical of what we receive in our parish homilies - beige. No fire. Academic. After reading the notes one could wonder why the Bible is such a best seller.I think it was an honest attempt to make the Bible accessible to more people in the parishes. I think the editors would have done far more good had they used the style of the ""Life Application Bible"" series and just 'tweaked' it for the Catholic audience.If your studying the BIble academically this version may help you a bit. If you are approaching the Bible to have an encounter with God - and your new to Bible Study - perhaps The Life Application Bible would be of greater service."
1,Change for the worse,"The service is getting worse. The What Do You Think? segment is not working, missing most of article. Also now shows audio and video links which obviously don't work on a Kindle. Too bad, I've always enjoyed The Onion and hope they realize that they should tailor this to the Kindle's strengths."
5,I love it,"My wife and i love this perfume. everyone asks her ""where did you get it"". great perfume for that price"
3,Black Athena voL-I,Sorry this is not an review I am going to write. I want to buy the volume II and III of this book. I guess it is not listed in your database. Can you let me know when it will be available.
1,I prefer the truth,"Those who promote this book and others like it, are promoting their own racist agendas-read the 5 star reviews below. If one actually speaks out, they are labelled as racist by this very crowd-how interesting."
1,Sensationalist publishing,This book joins the army of pseudo-history series published for the audacity of their claims rather than the level of their academic merit.
1,A joke,"The subject of this book is not the discussion of the Greek civilization but the appropriation of Greek culture for the ideologically motivated construction of African (see African American) culture. Bernal replaces the 19th c. Aryan racist appropriation of the Greek phenomenon, with an African American appropriation of the 20th c. for the sake of political correctness (Bernal is not black, and this is not to be missed, dear African American friends). Greek culture and language still exist -- and have survived for more than three millenia despite historiographical fraud -- and for those who have not noticed are neither Aryan nor African. Check out idiois omasi, that is if you are not blinded by your short-lived political and ideological agendas."
1,Fuzzy math-or sociology?,"Here's a model for those unsatisfied with history: Re-write it!There is overwhelming evidence to support the fact that the majority of Greeks are Indo-European. This is quietly ignored in the book.The greatness of Greek civilization was of their own making. Briefly, look the culmination of the Greek's art, philosophy, drama, etc and compare. From which Africans exactly did the Greeks copy the Olympics? Oedipus Rex? Shock troops(i.e. the phalanx)?This book could only have been published in the current revisionist era, otherwise, it gets laughed out of any publisher's office."
1,Ugh,"I guess I knew the whole Black Greece concept is passe, but after reading this drivel, I need to point out a comparison. Please read Lefkovitz's ""BLACK ATHENA REVISITED"" and compare. Bernal is anything but academic on this one issue."
1,An embarassment,I find it hard to believe that anyone could take this seriously. I do realize that Afrocentrists have embraced bernal in an effort to improve self-esteem among their students. We all know how false this is and the future consequences. What a shame.
1,Dirt Bike Runaway,Dirt Bike RunawayI think this is a really good book to read for people who are interested in a dirt bike book. I have a four-wheeler so I like reading these kinds of books. Matt Christopher writes a lot of good books about sports. I would recommend this book to kids from the age 11 to 15.The guys name is peter and he is a genius with dirt bikes. He can fix them up. Peter is a good rider when he races also. Peter started the race and was really nervous when he would ride a berm and go off a jump. He seen jess riding right beside him and trying to run him of the track but he stayed focused and didn't move. Peter was mad after he finished the race because he didn't place as well as he wanted to.I like how this book is easy to understand and you can comprehend all the information. It inspired me a little bit. This is a great book for kids and young adults that like outdoor or dirt biking books. I would recommend this book to anyone
5,great reference,"This study guide helped me pass my spinal anatomy class in my chiropractic college. I also have an MD degree and wished I had this book for my anatomy classes in medical school; it would have made those classes a lot easier. In fact, this was a great reference because it made me realize what type of questions would be asked on the test. It also is very thorough for each topic."
1,Where's the mazes?,I bought the On-the Go-Games pack for the mazes because my 4-year old loves mazes. Much to my surprise there are no mazes on it! I am VERY disappointed...
5,A dream toy for fine motor skills,"My 4 year old boy needed something to improve his fine motor skills. We have tried EVERYTHING! This software (and the others as well) not only improves fine motor skills but encourages them to use creativy, problem solving and have fun! With so many electronic toys out there, it's difficult to find one that is non violent, inexpensive and educational but this is one that parents and children will agree on and in fact, I can only think of one problem with this game....he can't get it away from me :)"
1,"Arrogant and biased, ends up missing any subtle critiques","The fantastic arrogance of the title ""THIS is Cuba"" should let you know that the text of this traveler-cum-pseudo-anthropologist is going to be fairly insufferable. For more nuanced (but still critical) travel diary sorts of things, look at ""Cuba Diaries"" (highly recommended) or even ""Es Cuba."" This tract is a waste of time."
2,"negative, depressing","Ben Corbett's motive in writing this book must have been to discourage tourism to Cuba.I used to think I would enjoy seeing the island, but now, after reading this dismal account of the failed Socialist experiment, I figure why bother?I could stay here in the U.S. and visit Detroit or Los Angeles and experience the same atmosphere of prostitution, petty criminality and rampant con men with no need for a visa"
5,Tough Stuff,We used this pipe to build our waterfall last year and wanted something very durable that could easily handle being buried. This does the trick! We've haven't had any issues with it so far. I can even stand on the a section of the pipe that is slightly exposed and it doesn't seem to give at all. Great product.
2,YP-E64 Not what I thought.,"I was under the impression that the YP-E64 could be upgraded to a total of 128MB by using a 64MB Smart Media Card. This is not true. I was very disappointed about that. I tried using a 64MB SMC I bought specifically for this MP3 player, and ended up having to use the 32MB one I bought for my digital Camera. And the 128MB one I bought...useless, unless I want to take 300+ pictures with my camera. Other than that, the Voice recorder works great, and it sounds good. Just wish the voice recorder had the option to record at better quality than it does. Overall, it isn't bad, just not what I thought it would be."
1,Best of the bad,"This may be considered the best mp3 player on the market by some, but that isn't saying much for the price. Of the 7 different CF cards I've tried, only one worked. Note, the card that came with the unit fell out and was lost due to the slot being face down while using the belt clip (poor design.) I have also experienced hours of trouble with the software on 3 different computers. The software is a complete waist of time, you need a CF card adapter or a PC card reader to use it. The unit does sounds pretty good, but frankly given the size, I'd recommend a good tape player at 1/4 the price!"
1,This is a DO NOT!!!,"The latest reviews are outdated.I just bought it a week ago and have tried for a few days. It has all the features and extras for your car, however, once you start using it you'll hear squeaky noises and in some cases it doesn't even read the card. (No, the problem is not the mp3 files, I have tested them on an iPod and they work fine).Also, the company is out of business and there is no support for this product anymore."
3,Date but still relevant -- a responsible look at fish oil,The brother of a friend at college did some research into fish oil back in the early 80's. It has a lot of beneficical effects (if you take mega doses it can also make you a little slow witted -- but help protect you from handovers!). I bought this book second hand some time ago. I did not follow the diet but simply read the background information. If was very interesting. The health benefits of fish oil and mega-3 fatty acids has gained considerable currency in recent years and forms a significant part of the latest cutting edge diet/health work described by Dermitologist Dr. Pericone in his new book the Pericone Prescription (he has a long TV program which is often shown on public television at the moment).
1,Buy because you have to,This book leaves out the importance of the brand. Only buy it because you have to for class....and I suggest you purchase a used one as a new one is not worth keeping.
1,"Dreadful, boring, dont buy it","If you are compelled to see this video, borrow it or get it at the library. The narrator is appallingly boring with a fake, over articulated accent. The info from the ""real"" scientists is good and I have read some of their work, but the video presents it in such a boring way to render the info useless or unable to be applied by most people. Way too much emphasis was placed on finding a soul mate. The review claims it will help to communicate with the universe and bring our desires into manifestation. The video forgot to tell us how...."
1,Cheaply built POS,this thing leaked from day one and after a week it totally stopped working altogether. highly NOT RECOMMEDED
4,Another view through another window,"This is not really a sermon, more a sermon lived out. This diary shows in clear detail some surprising things that Nouwen believed. I'm sure more conservative Christians are going to go postal when they read this. But, this diary also shows clearly what Nouwen valued most: his relationship with other people. While Nouwen is an intimate and transparent writer, here you see what he has lectured and written on lived out in his life, through birth, death, celebration, Eucharist, and endless writing and revising. It's not an autobiography, but it is the closest one can get to understanding this priest who loved God and others."
3,For kids only,"Can keep kids entertained for a good stretch of time, but has no real educational value. It's just a basic card game (where luck is what really counts) with Greek mythology characters. Fun for kids"
1,A remarkably poor book.,"I hate to disagree with the other reviews you'll read here, but I honestly think this book is terrible. I've traveled quite a bit, in lots of different places, and I've really enjoyed books from the ""Let's Go"" series. This one, though, was so badly done that I found myself getting frustrated and angry each time I tried to use it.The authors try (too hard) to be cool and hip, and I'm afraid that they've let that get in the way of presenting their information in a way that makes any sense at all. And, I'm not just talking about the poor job they did describing the things I'd gone to Italy to see, either. Their maps were lousy, and this book lacks even such things as clear advice on such mundane things as getting your laundry done and how to use a payphone to call home.Do yourself a HUGE favor and steer clear of this pitiful attempt at a travelm guide."
3,alright sorta--,"I bought several of Sylvia Kristels movies to see what her movie life was about just after her death a bit ago, she appearently lived a life that was in her movies also-- sooo sad-- : The simulated sex and nudity was average ,----"
3,Rusting,"I love these knives because they cut so well, but I bought the $99 set and i have noticed some rust spots on some of the knives, and one of them has already chipped, and I haven't even had them for a month."
2,You get what you pay for,"We got these knives as a gift about 6 months ago. They look nice and they are sharp and do cut well. The knives rust very easily though, cheap steel I guess. They are also not well balanced in my hand. The handles are hollow not solid so the blade is heavier than the handle. I don't think these will last very long.I would not have purchased these on my own, I would have bought better knives that would last me longer. For the price they are fine but you can do much better if you spend more. I would rather have 3-4 really good knives than a bunch of OK knives."
5,Outstanding!,"The Didache, or the Teaching of the Twelve Apostles, is an essential work for anyone interested in understanding the early church in a manner true to the teachings of Jesus. The church today has changed a great deal from the ways of the early church. There is great value in a book such as this, which provides first-century insight into the core of our religious practices and beliefs. I recommend this book to anyone searching for an unbiased understanding of the teachings of the early church by actual witnesses to Jesus."
2,"Hate to buck the trend, but I find it very un-intuitive","You know, I've spent 20+ years in software, have a Masters degree in Computer Science, and I tell you, I get frustrated trying to figure this program out every time I use it ( which apparently is not frequently enough to remember all the tricks you need to know to get work done ). In user-interfaces, one typically design to either the novice / in-frequent user, or the advanced user .. I'm gussing this one targeted the latter. Help files [are not good]."
3,I Really Wanted to Like it More,"This book has its moments. The author returns to Vietnam years after being a soldier there and travels around the country.I really wanted to like the book more than I did. However, even though it is a small book, I got the feeling that at least 25% of it was sort of filler. I understand his Paco's Story is a great book. I need to read it. In the meantime, I wouldn't recommend this book."
3,don't bother with this one,"I found this new dvd on sale in a store for $3.00 and I was all excited because I'm a big Keira Knightley fan. What a let down. Great cinematography, beautiful music, not enough of Knightley, and the movie was VERY slow. It almost seemed it happened in real time - years! If Knightley's character was so important in her husband's life, I don't feel her character was developed enough. Period movies are among my favorites but this one almost put me to sleep. Good intentions, but it unfortunately was not successful. Now I know why it was $3.00. One reviewer wrote ""If you don't get it, don't review it."" I got it, I just didn't like it."
4,Loved it,"It was all about that letter in the end. That really tugged at my heart and frankly was the best letter I've heard in a long time.It was slow, but at the same time the right pace for the message it was trying to convey.It probably takes a certain type of person to appreciate it, but I feel it is a wonderful story."
4,"Good Sweater, Runs Small","This is a quality made sweater for the price. The only thing is that it runs smaller than the size guide. When ordering, I'd suggest getting one size up. I ordered an x-small for my 5 lb pomeranian. It's a bit snug and short. It doesn't cover his entire back like the picture shows. I had to cut off the leg straps because it wouldn't stretch far enough."
4,Celtic Ball Indian bedspread,Not quite what I was looking for in a beadspread but it did make a very nice wall haninging above the bed.
1,Delusional Thinking,"Yes, this book is of historical interest, in the same sort of shameful way that lobotomies are of historical interest. Bettelheim's success rate was mostly fabricated. There is good evidence that he abused the troubled children in his care. (See, for example, the evidence in ""The Creation of Dr. B"" by Richard Pollack). Primarily he was a charlatan, able to pull the wool over the public's eyes in large part because he practiced in the fuzzy field of psychoanalysis, with its near absence of scientific rigors. The book is evidently lots of fun for people who have never had to deal with real mental illness. It's appallingly cruel to parents of autistic children, particularly the mothers."
5,Mia Hamm,"I gave this book to my niece for xmas, she loved it. She plays for Fairfield Wardeand will be a great soccer star in her future."
4,great read for teens and inspiring soccer stars,This is an awesome book that combines training ideas and facts about Mia perfectly. The pictures are awesome and if you like Mia (who doesn't) I definetly recommend the book.
2,Didn't like the pictures,"I tried and tried to get my 2 year old daughter to read this one but each time she'd push it away and tell me she didn't like the pictures. We read many, many books while she ""sits"" and this one was just not one she'd recommend."
5,Well Researched and Right on the Money,"John Vennari's well-researched book uses first-hand reporting and authentic Catholic dogma and tradition to shed light on the popular charismatic movement which has swept the Catholic Church. This movement is not only Protestant and heretical in its origins, but also in its various manifestations. Vennari documents the chaos, the unbridled emotion and dangerous theologies which are the order of the day in charismatic gatherings. Truly, this movement is not of the Spirit....at least, not the Spirit of the true God."
1,10+ hrs. still not dry!,"It should be called ""grease"" and not ""Glaze"". I applied it to my new truck today because I read so many good things online, however it has been over 10 hrs and it's still not dry. It's not exactly warm weather but it has been certainly above 60F all day. Anyway, when I went to wipe it off it smeared and the only way to remove was to buff really hard (and scratch the paint) or use water...which ironically seemed to remove most of it. Hopefully, the remaining traces can be wiped off dry tommorrow. I don't know if I got a bad batch or what but no wax/sealant has ever behaved like this. It's more like an oily cream. I'm not sure what to reccomend but I now know what to NOT reccomend."
2,don't like the finish,"These are not what I thought I was getting. I expected the ""black satin"" finish to be that low gloss black wood grain type finish commonly seen on bookshelf type speakers. Instead, it's a rough black powder coat finish directly on MDF particle board. It looks like countertop formica instead of wood. As a woodworker, I have always understood a ""satin"" finish to mean a smooth finished surface with a subtle luster (as opposed to a glossy polyurethane finish). It seems pretty misleading to advertise these as ""black satin wood"" speaker stands. There is nothing ""woodlike"" about them."
1,Doesn't Last,"I've had this coffee maker for several months and have found that the heat, wear and tear of daily use takes its toll on the coffee maker. The filter compartment warped after several uses and the auto-stop drip mechanism's spring wore down quickly. Now I am no longer able to remove the coffee pot to pour a cup while brewing. The frother on the espresso side is weak, and the espresso is OK."
1,"The cappuccino was good, but the coffee-maker leaked","My first try at making a cappuchino was actually pretty good. However, when I went to make coffee with it, the water I poured in the water chamber leaked out onto the kitchen counter!I took it back to the store and exchanged it for another one, brough it home, and it ALSO had the same problem. There appears to be a hole in the bottem of the water chamber at the spot where the plastic was injection molded--a manufacturing defect.For this much money and this brand name I'd expect a better quality product. Now I need to decide if I should just get my money back or go for strike 3."
3,So-so Franco movie,"Nightmares Come at Night is one of those Jess Franco movies you may want to see when you've already seen his best work. There's not much of a plot here, but then that's usually not what you watch a Franco movie for. Unfortunately it also doesn't have the stunning visual qualities of Vampyros Lesbos orShe Killed in Ecstasy. If you're a Soledad Miranda fan you should be aware that she only has a few minutes of screen time before you decide whether to buy it or not. The stars here are Diana Lorys, Colette Giacobine and Franco regulars Paul Muller and Jack Taylor.This is not the place to start if you're new to Franco, but if you're already addicted and want to see one more of his lesser efforts, go ahead.A weak three star rating."
2,Franco the Tanco,"I bought this film today (being a Franco and Miranda fan), but found myself a little dissapointed after watching it knowing it cost $20.It starts of good but then it suddenly goes nowhere until the last 12 minutes, when he throws you a suprise plot twist that explains everyhting that just saw for the middle 60 minutes. During the middle 60 min Annas reality is blurred with a lot of dream sequences, which includes lots of nudity. The last scene with Anna was cool in a freaky way, but the music definitely helped a lot. Better yet, the music and score by ? was excellent. I can honestly say the best 3 minutes of this movie was the 3 minutes Soledad Miranda was in front of the camera, she has something that is very hard to put into words.Buy it only if you are a Franco fanfreak and want to add it to your dvd library. Its a movie I wouldn't watch more than a few times. If your not sure, rent it or borrow it first, which will probably be pretty hard."
5,A must read!,"An exciting read, that you can't seem to put down!A great holiday gift for the entire family!"
4,Good account of soldiers' point of view leading up to Saddam's capture,"The last moment of hunt for Saddam was dramatically reported worldwide and John Bremer's announcement grabbed people's attention. But the Moore's detailed description including how soldiers on the ground felt had drawn little attention outside the small circle of people involved in the operations. While invation of Iraq itself lost legitimacy after intelligence of Iraqi WMD turned out to be vogus, all American servicemen in uniform still desderve credit for thier achievement. This is a memorable record of what was happening in Iraq and probably is still going on in the post-Saddam Iraq."
1,At least MST3K made it watchable.,"That's right, Merlin's Shop of Mystical Wonders, from the guy who gace you ""Santa's fabulous workshop"" (where elves lose their hands in the assembly line), ""Furry Bears Picnic"" (where Harry the Hedgehog is smote to death with a can of pork and beans), and ""Fluffy Bunny's New Blue Suit"" (where fluffy's liver is horribly ingested. I would have named it MERLIN'S PIT OF DECEPTIVE DOOM."
1,Sour Grapes,"Two horribly mismatched people stumbling through a relationship that didn't have a chance in heck of working. I kept hoping that the protagonist would wake up and dump him if their relationship was as bad as the author describes. I also felt that there are two sides to every story and wondered what the ""captain"" would say if he could write a book. Was he treated fairly by ""The Boat Bastard""? I doubt it. It must be terribly comforting to write a book about a break-up where you can airbrush your own flaws while highlighting those of your ex. Then all you have to do is admit to some not-too-objectionable personal foibles yourself to give the impression that you are being brutally honest.I didn't enjoy this book and would not recommend it. A more apt title would have been ""Sour Grapes""."
3,Video Cord,The ends were not the right size so my brother put some on for me. There was certainly plenty of it.
3,fun and interestiing,When this toy first arrived my dog loved it! My golden loves balls and loves plush toys however he will usually destroy a plush toy very quickly to get the squeeker out! What happened with this toy was about one day after having it he very easily seperated the tail from the ball. We still have both the tail and ball but they are no longer together. I am not dissapointed in the purchase since the price was reasonable and I still have a ball to throw out of it!
2,Disapointment,"I got my little gadget three days ago. I had no problem at first. However I did question their manual, which was absolutely no help when trying to figure i2GO out. Every page referred to their website for direction. The first thing I noticed about the website...it wasn't there. Yesterday while I was messing with some speaker cords to plug in for better sound (the speaker is pathetic) my i2GO fell about two feet onto the floor. Since then it has been shutting itself off. I replaced the batteries, and it has been touch and go since.I would not recommend this to anyone because of the bad tech support, and the durability is exaggerated."
1,Not the answer I was looking for,"I bought these bottles to try and get my breast fed baby to take a bottle. While the flow may be more like the breast, the shape of the bottle is not. The flat, indented nipple is strange and my baby showed no interest in them. We had much better sucess with Playtex Nursers."
1,Impossible to get hold of - author unhelpful,"I've heard this book is great but personally I or anyone else within my organisation wouldn't know because acquiring it has become one of the most difficult and convoluted exercises I have had to deal with in the past few years. I tried to purchase via many a bookstore then Amazon, B&N etc etc and then direct via the publisher - who are 'Human Rights Press' anyway??? When this fly-by-night publisher was evidently uncontactable via their very professional hotmail email address, as a last resort, we contacted the author direct. Things looked promising for a while, he offered to help, took my details but then started to ignore my emails when I inquired as to why the work, as promised, never showed up. One would think he would show some good faith considering who we are in the human rights field. I will never again attempt to purchase any work by this author."
2,too perfumy,it has way too much perfume. It's too strong and I find it overbearing. Gives me a headache. If strong scents don't bother you I guess it would be nice. I won't buy it again.
4,Like the product,I'm just trying how it works. So far so good. My skin is very sensitive and very dry. Not many creams work for me. But this cream is working. It does moisturize well. My skin gets silky and smooth. Happy with the result. Even with a short time of using it.
2,A fictional story of Rommell.,I guess this and THE DESERT FOX aren't as good as the publicity used in the theatrical release years ago. I have both titles in my collection. I like James Mason so it isn't a total loss.
3,bang then fizzle,"I was eager to read this book...The beginning was terrific with fascinating original characters and what appeared to be an original plot. I hunkered down full of anticipation. However, I never understood any of the characters. The last third of the book was an endless 'action film' script. The ending, was, well, I let the author ruin that for himself."
3,Wrong dust cover,"Got the parts withing a reasonable time. Instructions were good. I had trouble with one of the speakers that I put on wrong. The instructions indicated to place a spacer at 12, 5, and 7 o'clock. On the second speaker I placed the spacers all the way around, and it turned out good. Also the dust covers were too small. I wrote to the parts express and was told it was my own fault for not specifying when ordering."
1,Depressingly Bad,"You know when you open a book on witchcraft at random and you see a paragraph starting ""Ancient Wiccans..."" that you've discovered a book that's incredibly bad.Wicca is a modern religion, not an ancient one. This book is full of inaccuracies. The author should be ashamed of spreading falsehoods and misinformation like this.This is definitely not a book on Wicca - it couldn't touch Wicca with a ten foot pole. I would never recommend it for someone interested in Wicca. In fact, I would warn them away from it vehemently. It's not even a half-decent book on witchcraft. The spells are sub-par.Look elsewhere."
4,naturacare panty liner,"For years I have used Kotex panty liners everyday. Reading about all the pesticides in cotton & with vaccines for yet another type of womens cancer I thought I'd better check out an alternative. These are not as sticky or as long as what I'm used to but they do take care of business. My work commute is 4 hrs per day & I work around 10 hrs a day. Sometimes more. So needless to say, sometimes if I don't get a chance to ""refresh the liner"" it's there for practically 14-18 hrs. A long time without problems. The lady who wrote it dissolves around 12 hours may have a leakage issue! The minor inconvenience of short & not real sticky is worth much more than the consequences of pesticides leaching into my system. I'm also a big fan of the diva cup. Thanks Nutracare for putting out a product that makes us worry less about one or more toxins going into our bodies. To our health ladies!"
4,Even more beautiful when it's right in front of you,"This is even better when you get it. I was a bit concerned about the condition it might be in when I got it because I read some reviews that said the packaging wasn't very good and that they received it broken and that the replacement was also broken. I however, was lucky. It was in perfect condition and was dainty and delicate. Just breathtaking. The packaging could be done better with this being a breakable object, but its worth it if you do get it and its all in one piece. :)"
3,DIAPOINTMENT!!!,"DIAPPOINTMENT!!! That is what describes best my feelings about my purchase...Purchased on 09/09/2009!? and... not received yet /it is 13 Oct 2009 now!!!/! If that is the way deals are done i will reconsider further buyings! Regards,Y.A.KrastevGarmin compatible PC Interface Cable with Cigarette Lighter Adapter for GPS 12, 38, 40"
1,"Powerful, but loud, smelly, and usually broken","I will never buy another Hoover again. This is a powerful and easy to use machine that cleans deeply, but I have to take it apart regularly to clear hair out of it. If you have hair, and most of us do, it binds up in the brush bearings, causing them to melt their housings and the brushes and making an unbearable burned hair/plastic stench. I have replaced the brushes once, and lubricate the bearings frequently. When picking up a small rubber band caused the gear drive for the brushes to melt and sieze, that was the end. I disassembled it to try to repair it, but seeing the extent of the damage, dumped the whole thing in the trash. Anyone else would have thrown it away in the first year. Hoover makes dozens of models of vac, with every conceivable kind of gadget, but they should make at least one that works well."
5,Best cookbook yet,"I got this cookbook because I wanted some healthy recipes. I have to say the I have made about ten recipes from it so far and I haven't made one that I didn't like yet.My favorite part is that the ingredients are not rare or exotic. Most of the ingredients called for, I have already. I have gone through a couple different cookbooks in the past and I have to say that this is the best one yet, and I'm not even a diabetic. I would recommend this book to both people with or without diabetes. It's great! and the receipes are good for you!!!! You won't be sorry about this purchase."
2,Surprised,"I bought this cookbook for my Mom who is a brittle type 2 diabetic who recently had a heart attack. I wanted to give her meal ideas so she doesn't despair over having to limit her diet further b/c of her recent heart problems. I've only looked through it, I'm giving it to her today. But I'm really surprised at the sugar content in the recipes. I would expect 1-5 grams here & there but some of these recipes are really high. And if you are looking for a cook book that has some ideas for diabetic friendly desserts, this is not the book. Out of the 13 dessert recipes the sugar grams range from 4-26 grams; for an average grams of 12.5. I'm surprised & a bit disappointed."
4,good condition,"The book was in great condition. Great,quick easy recipies but wish it had more pictures. It is nice to see the dish."
1,Completely Absurd! DO NOT BUY THIS UNLESS YOU PLAN TO TAKE TIME TO MODIFY IT,"I purchased three different sizes of this sweater, for my three dogs, based on the reviews it received. Most of the reviews stated that is was a great sweater for the price. I'm going to safely say these reviews were not from actual customers, as it is completely impossible and implausible that a turtleneck sweater for a dog would not have some sort of opening to get the front legs in once the neck portion had been inserted. I've tried to get both head and legs in, to no avail...completely impossible. It's an absurd design. Save your money and time, unless you're going to take the time, as I will to open the chest area and insert velcro or a zipper to close and open the sweater. My time and extra money on supplies will render this a $35 sweater. Luckily I'm not a stranger to sewing, but for those who'd rather have a finished product...SKIP IT, IT'S NOT A GOOD DEAL!!!"
5,Works great with USB->Serial Adapter,"Had no problems using this on my macbook with geocaching.com using a generic USB to Serial adapter. Cable is high quality, fit is snug with my eTrex Summit."
4,Solid study of a unique American figure,"Randolph is the shining example of a long dead brand of American conservatism. These conservatives refused to build their political theory on the metaphysical rights of man, the driving force of Jefferson and the American Revolution. Instead, their opinions were shaped by the belief that the way of life embodied by the wealthy southern landowner was inherently good and should be protected. Their insistence on a weak national government, their defense of slavery and their advocacy of a limited franchise were all motivated by their belief that this way of live deserved to be preserved. They lost of course, to the benefit of thousands of people, but at the expense of the only thing that ever resembled a noble class in America. Their ideas deserve recognition and Kirk does a fine job relating the core of Randolph's thought. The lengthy and worthwhile appendix of Randolph's speeches and letters is worth even more than Kirk's fine analysis, however."
1,Clunky and disappointing,"The girth of this clipper makes it too clumsy for a feminine hand and impossible to use to clip the faces, toes, muzzle areas on a small dog. If you are a large man with a giant schnauzer, you might like this clipper. Otherwise, fuhgettahbowdit."
5,A novel about the dangers of getting what one wishes for,"Drama in the Church is a novel about the dangers of getting what one wishes for. A young woman seduced by the imagined lifestyle of being a gangster's girlfriend prays to God that she will find a thuggish boyfriend of her very own. When a handsome convict becomes interested in her, she is at first excited by her dreams come true; then the harsh realities of having a relationship with a criminal become all too clear. Seeking comfort in the sanctuary of the church, she examines the problems and hidden truths within herself, as well as the dark secrets of others around her. A passionate saga of love, lust, self-doubt, and the quest for wholeness, Drama in the Church is as captivating as it is salacious."
2,Forces you to read pt.2,Hello! check out my review under the Hardbook selection Titled: Holy Hell Nall! My pen name is: His Angel . ..thanks!&do yourself a favor&borrow this one.
5,great value!!,Ordered this for my wife's 2007 HHR. The instructions were pretty good overall. The instructions could have been a little clearer on which holes to use. I had some difficulty determining which of the back holes to use. I put the bolts in the wrong spot and had to fish them back out to relocate them. The hitch is fairly heavy and it would help to have an extra set of hands when you are ready to lift it into place. It didn't take very long to install. I had it done in less than 2 hours even with having to reposition the back bolts and taking a coffee break. You will need to be able to raise the back end of the car up to have some room to work though. I jacked my rear tires up and put my wheel ramps under them. Worked great and was very safe.
2,Is the Borzoi the right breed for me?,"I'd only recomend this book if you think the Borzoi MIGHT be the right breed for you. It's a very superficial book with some photos from some not ""really correct"" borzoi's. It has the kind of information for people that doesn't know what a Borzoi is or have several breeds in mind and haven't make a choice. The first chapter focus on Borzoi's and then it talks about care, some diseases, a little training, etc. All these could be about any breed, it's not focus on Borzoi. And to be perfectly honest sight hounds need different care and training than most dogs, so not even good for that. If you already own a Borzoi or know a little about the breed and need to know more. Please, pick a better book.Probably if your kid is interested in learning a little about the breed and basic care of a dog I'd buy this book."
1,Lacking Information...Save Your Money.,"I was looking forward to receiving this ""book"" by the description and because of the information given concerning the author. However, upon receiving the ""book"" I was completely in shock. I kept thinking I must be missing something. There has to be an additional copy or second volume. No such luck. This is nothing more than a reference/dictionary of real estate terms that someone has carelessly thrown together to make a few dollars. It in NO WAY gives indepth instruction or guidence in the aspect of title searches. It does however imply how it might be approached. I suggest that if you want professional instruction do not waste your money on this 120 page soft cover desktop published appearing ""booklet""."
4,NOT THE SAME,The book I ordered said it was in great shape and it really wasn't.There was dirt all along the pages and one of the corners was damaged. Other than that the price was fine and the speed of shipping was excellent. Next time reveal the condition.
3,Very nice but smaller than I imagined,We purchased this tunnel for our son's first birthday as a supplement to theChildrens Factory CF321-049 Soft Tunnel Climberwe got him for Christmas. I love the durability of this tunnel and our son loves playing with it. However I admit that I'm a bit disappointed at the size. It is much shorter than I imagined and the crawl space seems tight even for my 20lb 12 month old. I was hoping that he would grow with this along with the other set but I think he'll outgrow it within a year.
2,Not enough information,"The information presented in this book seem to have been written in haste. The topics come to an abrupt end without much explanation. At many places, it merely points to other resources without even presenting some brief discussion. The section on kernel compilation is very short. No information is provided on selection of options under ""make xconfig"" command. It seems to be a very basic introduction to SuSe Linux."
4,Quick and Dirty,"This product arrived quickly, but it appeared rather dirty. Still, I was happy with the purchase."
5,Origami: The Art of Paperfolding,"You can never go wrong with a Gay Merrill Gross origami book. After viewing the photos of the models, you will want to fold everything in the book. The diagrams and text are clear and easy to follow. This book comes with good quality paper and a nice storage area for you to keep it in. The models range from playful, to decorative, to useful and are all fairly easy--a good book for a beginner."
2,Ski Glove?,Wife used these gloves for skiing. Her fingers were constantly cold. Glove is probably O.K. for other activities but not snow sports. For the price they were worth a try.
1,Wish I had those four hours back...,"I just watched this whole piece of trash. No plot, hammy dialog, a few jumps (but any movie can accomplish those with the proper music and a quick cut to a frightening image) but basically a 4 hour empty shell. This isn't just re-hash...it's re-hashed re-hash. This plodding snorer could EASILY have been pared down to 90-120 minutes. Even at that length, I suspect I'd have been bored, at 4 hours...I'm still not sure why I kept watching. After investing three hours, I was hoping something in the end might redeem it. Nope. By the way, I've read a few of the reviews here and I'm finding it hilarious that some people are treating this as non fiction, just because ABC aired a silly 30 minute ""documentary"" to hype the upcoming mini-series."
4,Rose Red DVD,I ordered this for someone else and they had already seen the movie and really liked it. Good scarey movie.
3,"Nothing scary here, but still watchable","Yet another King story gets the TV miniseries treatment. Thankfully ROSE RED is much better than the incredibly dull STORM OF THE CENTURY; but its still nothing special. This revolves around a group of people with unique supernatural powers who are bought to a creepy old house by a College professor to try contact the ghost that supposedly lives there. Not a very new idea. Could this be THE SHINING for the 21st century? Is Steve running out of ideas? Maybe, its still quite good and King fans will probably feel obliged to watch it but you won't find many surprises here. King himself has a brief cameo as a delivery man."
2,The great deja vu experience,"Yes, I've seen all this before. The huge nasty old house, which hasn't been lived in for countless years but is still spotlessly clean with fresh beds, the madman (or madwoman in that case) builder, the whacko psychics, the professor keen on proving the supernatural ... I wonder if the spirits of Richard Matheson, Bentley Little, Shirley Jackson a.s.o did haunt Mr. King for copying so much from their work. The psychics except Annie don't do anything psychic at all, they just walk in, scream and flutter around like chickens with their heads hacked off. The dialogue is horrible, the acting bad, the characters chliché, and half the story gets lost in between (what happened to Prof. Miller? why did no one care about Pams disappearance?)a.s.0.) Then, when the film runs out of ideas, the big meteorite hail knocks everything to pieces, the light goes on, the film ends, and I woke up from dozing with a start. Yawn.Two stars for atmosphere und photography."
5,Much better on DVD than ABC!,"I was very disappointed when I first saw this movie on ABC.I started not to get the DVD, but was impressed with the customer reviews. It was 100% better on DVD! I'm glad I made the plunge and purchased it. I have a suggestion for Mr. King:Next time go straight to video, or at least someone like HBO where you don't have commercials every eight minutes that's too distracting."
4,Rose Red pretty good....,"After reading some of the reviews, I felt that I needed to put one up too. I can't believe that so many people need blood and gore to frighten them. What I truly found frightening and entertaining in this film was the fact that the people disappeared and you didn't really know what happened to them. I find that my imagination is much scarier usually then what any show on T.V. can show me. That's why I enjoyed Rose Red. While it is not the greatest TV mini series ever made, I thought it was pretty good. I actually got startled a few times, and also was creeped out pretty good after the second evening. I would recommend the DVD mainly because I would think that without the commercials, it would really be pretty scary. Also, I recommend it for those people that simply like a good old fashioned haunted house movie. Without some creep with a knife jumping out of closets and blood and gore everywhere."
2,A wilted rose of a miniseries,"ROSE RED is one of Stephen King's worst attempts at a miniseries ever. The plot is all too predictable, and the acting mediocre. It seems King just wrote this miniseries to make more money. However, the film is not all bad. If you enjoy light horror, combined with some humour, and a few big names then you should buy ROSE RED.ROSE RED is set in Seattle where Dr. Joyce Reardon is a professor. She, and an expedition of psychics are about to embark on a weekend in Rose Red. Rose Red has a few surprises for its guests. Among its guests are Julian Sands, Matt Ross, and the late David Dukes. The acting is not at all impressive, and the plot seems as though King combined plots from his previous hits. This film is not one for the lover of movies of depth."
1,"Never ""Heard"" of 'im","The oddest thing about this disc is the inclusion of John Heard in the cast listing on the back. Where is he? Unless he plays Dukes's stand-in.Wait for Robert Wise's ""The Haunting"" to appear on DVD. It's the best haunted house movie from the best haunted house book.Don't waste time or money on this exercise in tedium."
2,Dead Rose,"Now, I love Stephen King. I will even say that I loved the build up in the first 2/3rds of the story. The character building was good although several people were more like caracatures. However, the last 2 hours pretty much people running around and screaming with no plot line. Good special effects, sure there were some of those, but that doesn't make up for the sad lack of a plot. Sorry, Stephen, not your best."
4,"Sometimes eerie, sometimes silly, but overall a pleasure","This satire has a politcal edge to it, but is pleasantly restrained. There is a wide range of musical styles used, and it is awkward at times, but the whole film has a sort of awkwardness that perfectly reflects its subject matter. Despite the design oriented visuals, the film avoids being an art film that only gallery-goers can enjoy."
4,"Nothing to add really, but . . .","Why does anyone listen to Leonard Maltin, and why does Amazon put his screeds online? How anyone can watch this film and come away without a smile and soft spot in their heart is beyond me."
2,My advice: pay more and get a real espresso maker,"After much experimentation with coffee grind, packing and brewing, I've figured out how to get okay results after much study on the Internet. But the end product always tastes a little burnt and salty when compared to good espresso vendors. I use the espresso side daily. Cover has broken, and I don't use the frother (it doesn't give the control I like when foaming the milk), and overall the unit is flimsy and awkward to use. When this unit finally dies, I'll pay the big bucks and buy a **real** Italian espresso maker."
1,Very little to like about these pathetic characters,"The heroine of this story is three times divorced and when we are introduced to her, she is feeling uncomfortable about the one night stand she just had the night before with a total stranger. Yep, that's quality for you. Later in the story she's supposed to be a role model for her one-night-stand-turn-boyfriend's teenage daughter and even reprimands the girl about her swearing. Where is this woman's morals? Casual sex is fine but watch the swearing? Yikes!The hero is not much better. He is the typical ""brooding, sensitive lawman"" but he comes off as weak and avoiding issues because it's easier to just suppress them and thus, increase his sensitivity to pain.This is one of those books that makes you wonder about the quality of material being submitted to publishing houses, if they consider a weak, cliché plot with pathetic characters print worthy."
2,Error-filled cd-rom!,"While I like the Pretest/Check your Progress method of reviewing terminology, there are so many errors in the scoring key that there is little benefit as you must recheck the answers with a dictionary. The transcription practice items are scored so erroneously on the CD-Rom version that you must use the key to check your work. And the cost of purchasing the transcription tapes is extremely prohibitive--much more than purchasing say a Prentice-Hall set of tapes and book. I've ended up purchasing a complete replacement for this text. I do not recommend this to anyone."
3,Little Tikes makes quality toys,"We have the school bus. Ours is 9 years old, and it looks like new. All of the Little Tikes toys we have have held up very well -after much playing with 2 children. My only comment on the description here - I would say that the bus is for ages 1 and up - age 3 seems to old to start"
2,2 Stars Because....,"This video does contain fabulous lingerie. Nudity, & Sex could've been very realistic, instead it was more like parental guidance movie.. The acting could've been better too. But I must say all actors get experiences and trained with movies like this. Most of the nudity is just not that great. I found myself FF'ing most of it. You're better off renting this or better yet getting it cheaper somewhere else, bc your interest will be lost. You wouldnt want to see it again. However this is a movie for girls and guys who really don't like watching to much sex. So I think this movie is simply between stinks and fair."
1,What should one write?,"Let's see if this is satisfactory to Amazon.com. This product looks cheap, the fork is tiny, the finishing is cheap, the material is too light. I don't think it could handle real carving. It was returned and I don't think I will purchase another item from Rada again!"
2,Quicken Slow,I have been using Quicken 2000 for seven years and only bought Q2007 H&B; after upgrading my OS from WinME to XP. Q2000 cannot now be registered and quickly timed out. Q2007 converted the Q2000 files even on my backup hard drive. Not good!Although Q2007 works the help files just come up as Java script files and Intuit has not been able to sort this out although they have tried hard to do so.The user interface screens have become far to fussy and not easily customisable. The only gain I have found is better customsation of reports.
1,Advertising,"Quicken software continues to contain prominent advertising for Intuit products and services. In my opinion, it is fine to offer additional services to customers, but give the customer the opportunity to say ""no thanks"" and then leave them alone so they can be productive with the software. Forever pestering a paid customer with advertising for the same products and services is not a good idea. Advertising takes up space in the user interface and is a distraction that reduces productivity."
1,"If you don't have to upgrade, wait until they fix it!","I was forced to buy Q2007 as Intuit quit supporting the version I owned. Nothing has impressed me as being an improvement. And of course the switching costs (like time getting up the learning curve) were annoying. On this basis I would have rated it a 3 star.However, I gave it a 1 because printing does not work. Everytime I try to print, preview, or print setup, the program shuts down. There is nothing wrong with my printers or drivers (besides working with every other program on my computer they worked with the previous version of Quicken). After spending a couple of hours troubleshooting, I discovered from Quicken's bulletin board that this is a known common problem, which Intuit has yet to provide a fix. Do they no longer have a quality control department?"
2,This is a well-designed game.,"Having said that, it was hard to learn and is generally aggrivating to play, but I'm sure it would be fun for people who like poker or Uno games."
4,Great show,"I really like this show and was pleased to see it offered here through Amazon, but I originally watched it on Netflix, and it was in English. I was disappointed when I started watching it through Amazon and realized that it's in Japanese with subtitles. I know a lot of purists say you should only watch Anime in Japanese because it's more true to the story, but who cares? I prefer it in English because I enjoy Anime for the beautiful artwork as well as the story--plus sometimes the Japanese dialogue in it's original form is a bit off to me. Other than that, aside from the bouncing boobs and panty shots (I'm a girl), as a zombie series, this is right up there with the Walking Dead. The emotions and tragedies are heartwrenching, and every now an then there's even some humor---but if you're like me, catch it on Netflix, where you can watch it rather than read it."
5,EXCELLENT CHOICE!,I bought this book for my 5 year old son. He is a die hard dinosaur fan. He loves it. The pictures in it are magnificent! The information is in laymens terms. You don't have to be a scientist to understand the content. There are tons of dinosaur pictures. Definately one of my sons favorite dino books!
5,Dinosaurs!,"My three year old is just discovering dinosaurs and loves to look through this book. As a life long enthusiast, I have loved having the opportunity to share with him and learned a lot myself from this resource. There is information here for any age group. The book clearly outlines dinosaur families and discusses individual species in detail. The illustrations are fantastic. Any family with an interest in dinosaurs would love this book."
2,Cooking Light needs help,"This(and other Cooking Light books)definately need a better way to organize the recipes. The book doesn't even follow the order of the monthly magazines recipes. It is severely lacking in photographs. Most of the beautiful photos from the magazines are not used in the cookbook. The photos would be helpful in selecting recipes...especially because the book is not organized by food category. The recipes might be great, but who has 2 hours to search through a cookbook to find something to cook??"
5,Important work.,The most relevant and significant ideas pertaining to planning and design today. Salingaros discusses concepts that are necessarily fundamental to a successful and responsible structure of the urban form. His work establishes guidelines that are progressive but highly rational and that I wish my own formal planning and design education focused more on rather than on principles that now seem out of date. Principles of Urban Structure sets the frame of mind from which any student or professional should approach their work.
2,"Contains whole sesame seeds, this is not clear from the description","I may still be able to use this mix if I pick out the sesame seeds, and it may make rice taste great, but I wish I had known there were whole sesame seeds in the mix."
3,Could have been so much more,"The history is fascinating - so many martyrs, so many enemies. The telling of that history, in this instance at least, is somewhat weighty. No doubt Mr. Wright is a very bright man and he does have a great appreciation of his subject matter but his literary style smacks of academia. Save for the sexy sub-heading -""Adventure, Politics, Intrigue, and Power"" the book reads like a thesis. His use of vocabulary borders on the obscure - not a trait inherent in bestsellers. Which this book could have been. All of the ingredients are there - "" Adventure, Politics, Intrigue, and Power"". Dan Brown has demonstrated a public fascination with arcana (albeit in a predictable and simplistic fashion) and Eco proved that one can be literary without being pedantic.All in all, I was disappointed but stuck with it to find out how it would end!"
5,Very important film,"This film recounts the story of Sarah Palin's political career from her humble beginnings as a City Council member and Mayor of a small city in Alaska, to membership on the State Oil and Gas Commission, to Governor, and then to her emergence as a national political figure. Even if you are not a fan of Governor Palin, this is film you must see. The examples in American history of leaders who are able to rise up from the ranks of everyday people into the top levels of politics and governance are few and far between. Even rarer are the ones who did it by fighting the status quo and the ""old boys"" establishment within her own Party at every step along the way.For anyone on the left, right or center genuinely interested in how to truly reform government in the interest of making it work for the people, this should be a must-see film."
2,Slightly informative Puff Piece!,"I watched the movie and this is nothing more than Puff Piece! There was no mention of Sarah's huge screw up with the hockey arena ([...]) which cost the good people of Wasilla millions ... or the road to nowhere which costs the taxpayers over $25,000,000 [...]. There was nothing critical in the film about Palin at all. What about the shopping spree where she basically stole 100's of thousands of dollars from the RNC? In retrospect you see this was a piece that was designed to springboard her primary run ... but that did not work out so well (opps ... defeated again). Wonder if all the folks who gave to SarahPAC got their money back??? Only reason I gave this 2 stars was I did learn a couple things about Sarah that I actually admired he for. One can not help but wonder where she would be if she had turned McCain down? She looked she could have been a great Governor???"
1,A complete lie,Dont waste your time or your money. This is complete garbage. The title itself is a lie. And all of those special highly paid artist and PR folks cannot rewrite history.
1,Steve,One star is too much. This woman is an IDIOT. Undeafeted HA!!! She quit half term for Gov. She lost the election for VP with McCann. Without this air head he would have won. Her husband belonged to a group that wanted Alaska to secede from the United States. Real true Americans HA! She only cares about the money she can make and that is it. Full of hatred and not even intelligent enough to say it in her own words.
2,Misleading Title: almost no info about 1997-1999 models,"This book is basically the same one published by Chilton that covers Ford Escorts up to about 1995. The title indicates that up to 1999 models are covered. Buyer beware! It does have OK material and photos for earlier 1.8 and 1.9 liter engines. However 2.0 liter engine information is lacking (i.e. late models 1997-1999). For example, jobs on 1.8 and 1.9 liter engines contain instructions and photographs for reference. 2.0 liter engines recieve terse comments and occasionally, crude cartoon drawings that are generally worthless. Adding several pages of new material is less than a revision in this case and does not justify a title change. Look elswhere for late model Ford Escort information."
1,Short and not so sweet,"Worked fine for a while till the interface died. However, I salvaged the drive and put it in another case and it still runs. Get a LaCie 1TB."
3,First effort,"CONFEDERATE COLONEL AND CHEROKEE CHIEF is a truly laudable first published research effort on the life of Will Thomas. Though it lacks the multi-sourced documentation/research of Thomsen's REBEL CHIEF and at times seems to come across more as a dissertation overview rather than as a ""readable biography"" it is nonetheless a pioneering work of note.One only wishes that the edition was sturdier and more reader friendly in layout and typeset."
3,Light Afternoon Read,"This was a light enjoyable read. The characters were decent and the message was good. Its not a book that you'd need to reread, but a great one to enjoy for the moment."
3,AN UNEVEN BUT FASCINATING FILM,"Perhaps Ken Russell's experience as a ballet dancer with a troupe in Norway enhanced his feelings about ways to illuminate homophobia of the 1920s in this semi-fictional account of silent screen star Rudolph Valentino's short film career. The real coup in this uneven but fascinating film is the casting of a mesmerizing Rudolf Nureyev as Valentino. The original poster is one of the greats (click under shared images), but the persistent rumor is that the studio chopped Russell's cut to bits. Is this yet another film ripe for restoration? Can what many see as high camp be reverted to art in a restoration? I think it's possible. Wonder if Criterion is up to the task assuming the original director's cut still exists?"
5,Great deck,"This deck doesn't just have a cute theme, the art is extremely well done with a sly wit and attention to detail. Probably not the best deck for absolute beginners, but not bad for a second or third."
2,not worth the money,"Just picked up this dresser today. I'm returning it tommorrow. The good things...the dresser was packed well, with no damage to the dresser.The bad....3 screws were missing on the drawer slides. The knobs don't fit snug against the dresser, despite using an electric screwdriver. The wood (i mean particle board) looks cheap. They call it ""natural maple"" when in fact it's fake birch. I would rather spend a couple of hundres dollars more to get a quality product!"
3,Beautiful--but arrived stinky!!,"While we thought the furniture was beautiful, when it was unpacked in our nursery, we soon realized it smelled of almost a chemical/varnish stench. We spoke to Babies R Us who referred us to Simmonds. The company admitted that they sometimes package the product prior to it being fully dried and suggested that we use Pledge and/or a mixture of vinegar/water every day for several weeks. We thought that was a bit out of the ordinary for brand new furniture of this price range and asked that they reorder another set. In total 3 weeks had past and we went ahead and Pledged the heck out of it and by the time the new furniture arrived, the stench was gone---but it took 3 weeks! Something to be aware of!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,the perfect gift,I bought this crucifix for my husband for CHRISTMAS.....it was a perfect little gift to show him how much I Love and respect our values and marriage. We are planning to buy a larger one for a wedding gift for our nephew.
2,So loud you can't hear the music,"I bought this toy for my three-year-old daughter. I think the only reason she plays with it is because she loves Thomas so much. The motor is so loud and annoying, you can not hear the music. It will only run on a totally smooth service. I would not recommend anyone to waste their money on this toy."
3,Quicken - Good Personal Finance Software for the Mac,"I have owned different versions of Quicken since the early days. I think 2007 version is very good for what I need it for. For some reason, it still crashes on occasion - I don't know if this is because my data file could be corrupt or if that file is too big - I tend to keep many years of data in each file. There are some new features that the 2005 version didn't have that I like."
4,Good little program,"If you want a simple to use program to manage personal finances Quicken is for you. I have found it very useful for keeping track of my checking and savings accounts. You can also make automatic posts to your accounts. Which is nice feature if you use automatic online bill pay with your bank. The program makes charts, graphs and reports showing where your money is going and coming from. It also does a nice job showing you if where you are meeting your budget and where you are spending too much money. Quicken makes keeps track of loans easy. It calculates how much money is going to interest and principle. I have been having a hard time and have been unsuccessful at setting up the program to track my 403B account. Overall, I think Quicken is a good program and recommend it to anyone to anyone who does not have a similar product already."
1,Just Awful - Use Windows and Parallels,"After purchasing and installing this software, the only positive I can say is that it has a good refund policy (60 days) and they honored it.After years with Quicken for Windows and high hopes for the Mac version, I was sorely disappointed.Want to find all transactions to a particular Payee and change the category? Easy in Windows, seemingly impossible on the Mac.Want to import your investment transactions from Windows? Not likely, at least without hours and hours hand fixing transactions.I got a refund and bought the Windows version to run on Parallels. The windows version works like a charm, albeit with some minor annoying flaws. Importing transactions went fine and the feature set is years ahead of the Mac version.Save your money.."
1,Worthless,I've used Windows Quicken for years and have few if any complaints. Mac version is a waste of money. Why they didn't just copy Windows program is beyond me. Problems are too numerous to list here. See other reviews.Bottom line: don't bother.
1,Save your money!,"If you are a user of Quicken for Windows, don't even think of switching to this product. Spend your money on Parallels, and run the Windows version on your Mac. Quicken for the Mac would not be a good deal if they gave it away for nothing. Too many things, including conversion of your data files, just do not work."
1,Wasted effort.,"I can't understand why Intuit just doesn't port over the current windows versions? THis offering is horrendous, and the new replacement doesn't seem to be much better (per discussions left by beta testers.) Would be nice to see a decent financial product appear for Mac."
2,Same as 2004,"I have to agree with all these reviews already posted. I was getting error messages for Intuit stating that I would not be able to download stock quotes after a certain date, so I ordered a new copy of Quicken for $50 thinking it would be an upgrade. To my amazement, it is exactly the same as Quicken 04, no real developments. I feel very cheated by Intuit. If 04 was only going to be good for a couple of years, they should have disclosed the fact in the first place. If they are going to squeeze money out of loyal customers, I would at least expect and improved product. They are making a real mistake here, as their credibility is now zip. I have been buying TurboTax every year, and have been a loyal Quicken user for many years, but now I think I will look for something else."
1,A major disappointment,"I have been using Quicken for many years. It began as a wonderful user friendly program for balincing a number of accounts. It was slick! Key word was ""was"". With every new version there were new whistles and bells. Things I would never use but the basic function we needed remained usabe. Reciently I upgraded to an Imac running Lepord (aka OSX). The instalation was problematic so the I had the Apple Genious bail me out. Once running I discouvered that not all my reports, scheduled transactions and other files did not make the leap from the PC to Mac platform. Trying to use it led to our next geat disappointment. I don't know how they hadle their wisbang stuff but for doing the check book if falls miserably short. We will be keeping a PC around just so we can run a usableform or Quicken."
1,Not worth It!!!,This is an awful personal finance product! It is as if they designed Quicken to be a nightmare! Syncing Quicken with my internet accounts rarely works without major problems. Quicken constantly miss categorizes my expenses---It keeps assigning my gym membership to Auto: Fuel every month! Although I've spent plenty of time in the manual and trying to tweak the program it is still a nightmare. Perhaps I'm a moron--but I feel that a personal finance product should be moron friendly. I would have been better off with pencil and paper. Quicken is way overpriced for the value you receive--none!! Intuit deserves to go bankrupt!
1,Difficult transition from Quicken for Windows,It is very difficult to convert a Windows Quicken file to a Mac version. One must manually change account and category names to no more than 15 characters in length. No automatic utility is provided to do this. So a considerable time investment is required to convert your files to Mac use. Don't expect Quicken to work like MS Word or other programs that can read files written on Mac and PC versions. I plan to keep my old PC and run the Windows version until the Mac version is cleaned up.
1,"I Hate, Hate, Hate Intuit Quicken for Mac!!!!","This version is buggy (like all Mac Quicken versions have been), and is annoyingly short on features. It will download the same transaction from my bank multiple times. And I can't get rid of some auto-fill categories, no matter how many times I delete them.What's worse: Quicken Financial Life for Mac, due about the same time Quicken 2009 would have been available, is going to have even less features than Quicken 2007 for Mac (which was released in 2006). Of course, that doesn't mean Intuit will charge any less for the ""upgrade."" I'm sure QFL will end up being a subscription service, so Intuit can get money from the people who normally only upgrade every couple years.I only wish there was a viable alternative to Quicken! I've tried all the other Mac financial applications, and they're all lacking, mostly in auto-download capability. Why can't somebody make a better application than this dog?"
4,accurate description,"delivery was prompt ..... description told about underlining and comments. I was surprised still by how numerous they were, to the point where it was difficult to read the book."
4,Dated but Still Worth Reading,"This author is well known and respected in the genre and this novel will only add to that reputation. Of course, the dilemma is this current book is a reissue of a decade old book. Although the story is well told, thoughtfully seated in early 20th century history and has exciting elements of the historic Chicago fire throughout--it's still sadly dated. This is felt in the slower tempo of the story, the quiet, almost boring touch to the sensuality and the overall elements to the characters that defer excitment. Solidly researched story about an exciting time and place, that never quite touches the characters lives ending with snoozy discussions on early 20th century feminist politics--best left as a ""pass""."
2,Love Song,"I was very interested in viewing a movie about an interracial romance and this one provided a good one; however, Monica Arnold really could not act. Her character came off stiff. It was obvious that there really was not a chemistry between her and her lead man. Overall, I wish that I had waited and just rented the thing!"
5,A Feel Good Movie,I rented this movie on a rainy day with nothing else to do. From the beginning this movie grabs your attention and doesn't let go. It's a movie that I can relate to. I watched it 2 times in one day and can't wait to watch it again. What a great job. Leaves lots to the imagination (which is rare these days). A must see.
4,nice ESL teaching tool,"This is a good way to introduce common idioms to young ESL students. Many of the sayings in here we don't use any more, but still, they are part of our culture, so it's not a waste of time to go through them. The pictures are really lively and fun."
1,Don't forget your mother!,"This book completely leaves out Calvin's fourth book, his treatment of the church. My suspicion is it was omitted because Calvin's doctrines didn't line up with those of the publisher. This ignoring of the doctrine of the church reinforces the erroneous idea that the body of Christ is insignificant when Calvin himself considered the Church our Mother."
2,Inspector Morse,I haven't watched it yet. I thought it was a movie not a documentary about thecharacter. Should have looked closer at description.
2,Almost Pure Poison,"I gotta admit it, I love horror films...especially 80s slasher films. Hell, I even love cheese like Sleepaway Camp and Night of the Demons. But, I didn't think much of this movie. The death scenes weren't very well done, the CGI was terrible, and the acting was ho-hum. Worst of all was the story which didn't make sense at all. I'd say save your money but chances are, if you want to see this movie...you're going to anyway. I didn't hate it...it's just not very good. Overall, it's just another bland, lifeless horror film that lacks life (it's no surprise that this one was on the shelf at Dimension for over a year after it was completed)."
1,The Ultimate Movie Review! - [...] - @tss5078,"How bad was Venom? It was so bad, that they couldn't even get things to jump out and scare you at the right time! It absolutely kills me! The story is fairly original with definite potential, the cast is fairly well known, and the movie was just awful! Why? Take your pick between bad writing, cheap special effects, no character development, and a really stupid ending. I like the whole Louisiana Creole background and the mysterious voodoo religion, that no one believe in anymore, but they just didn't take it anywhere. It's 15 minutes of interesting and an hour and 15 minutes of cheesy slasher bull, with typical lines, no eye candy, no comedy, nothing! It was quite boring and the ending just... wow! I don't know if it was rushed or if they just didn't care, but it was so stupid!! Venom could have been a lot more, but it wasn't anything worthwhile."
3,Average horror movie with above average FX,"As the other reviews have mentioned. With this one, we pretty much revisit the indestructible slasher / killer flicks like Friday the 13th, and Halloween. Its not a bad movie, but the problem is its not a good movie either. Too much cliché. The acting was not so hot either. I would recommend it for a rental, but as it gets closer to the end, it will start to lose your interest. I got bored with it. It had a ""been here, done that"" feeling to it. No new territory was covered here either. Production is good, quality is good, and it is above your average B-horror movie, but on the flip side, in 5 years you will never remember this movie."
2,Dissapointed with the ending!,"I have to say I was dissapointed with how the final volume of Burn up excess ended!The first two episodes leading up to the finale were pretty good, and I was really excited,but the last episode made me feel as though the producers were trying to squeeze to much in at the last minute.There was way to many things left unanswered as well. I wish that at least the final episode could have been longer or the producers of the show could've made it into a 26 episode series to sum things up completely. Heck it could've even stayed a 13 episode series if they got rid of the pointless filler episodes,and just use those episodes to go deeper into the show.m My rating 2 stars,maybe a 3."
1,I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS BOOK!,"I was quite embarrassed for the author, obviously he wrote this book of so called fine entertaining in great style for his very close friends. I could get the same advice down at the hairdresser. Fine cuisine is not his forte, boring beyond words."
5,Now I can entertain anyone,I and my friends had so much fun reading and using this book. Nelson Aspen has a great sense of humor and style.We'll be dishing up lots of great parties
1,Not a good read,I didn't like this author. Her books were not believeble to me. I usually read the last chapter first for some reason and I found her prayer that she wants ppl to recite is false. So needless to say that turned me off big time!
2,not comfortable,These look great but are very uncomfortable in the arches. I bought orthotic inserts at the drugstore and now can wear these shoes.
5,Up In Arms,"If you love or loved Danny Kaye's zany face and body language, you will love the scene in which one of Danny's so-called buddies catches him using his record player ...I literally fell of the couch laughing and breathing heavy!"
5,Very Fun....My Kids LOVE it!!,"I bought this for my son's 7th birthday, and all 3 of my children love it!! the only down side is waiting 4+ weeks for the ants so I built our ant farm and went outside and got some ants I even got a queen and they started working right away, making tunnels, ""fixing up their house"" it's very cool to see them working, and building."
4,This was the better one...,"The APCCGNN series has both a TV and OVA version, as well as a one or two episode OVA. All of them are different. When I first ordered this title, I mistakenly ordered the TV series. It was decent, but had a different set up. This OVA has a much shorter number of episodes, and is much more funny - and fun.I would recommend you get this one first. If you want more NUKU NUKU in your diet, you should then move on to the TV series."
5,"The best system, Period.","I've been looking for a replacement system for my ten year old CD shelf system/player that was on it's last leg. Man, this system ROCKS! It will rattle the windows. It's easy to set up, it charges the iPod while it plays, and for me, I like the fact I can set the alarm on my iPod and wake up to music. Bought it out of Ft. Worth, Tx. Great price, and packaged perfectly.This is a must system for any iPod owner."
2,sorely disappointed,"i just finished running dog by don delillo. i was promised ""the lurid elements of the thriller--espionage, assassination, pornography--into a work of art that captures the fevered shades of the latter-day American psyche.""well, i got those elements, but i was missing cohesion, plot and character development. i'm disappointed and feel like i wasted a lot of time, during which i racked my brain trying to figure out who any of the characters were and what the hell they were doing -- forget about their motivations. i expected it all to pull together in the end, and i thought that if i just paid enough attention i would get a riveting denouement and payback. no such luck!i loved white noise, but this one is a bummer!"
3,Fortitude Needed,"Need a lot of fortitude to get through this video. Pace is slow and has a strong ""home movie"" flavor."
1,A disappointment,"I bought one after all the rave previews on the net. Mine came with plenty of flashs, overmoulds, warpping and gaps. I had to file so many parts to make them fit decently. This is my 1st Revell kit, and the 1st impression is not good. Maybe I bought a lemon Typhoon, I don't know. I have another Revell kit, an F-22. I have to check if the quality is better. If not, then that will be the last Revell kit for me."
3,fine if you want technique over music,"Mr. Badila is known primarily for his amazing technique and unbelievable tempos, but his renditions of Bottesini works are about the worst interpretations of Italian bel canto playing that I have found on CD. The pieces are nothing more than show pieces for Badila and often sound as though a metronome was clicking in his headphones becuase the tempos are so strict. ""Carnival of Venice"" is amazing, but find Stefano Sciascia's recording of it-the entire CD is of Bottesini as played by a lyrical Italian. If you want fast notes, this is for you. If you want phrasing and rubato...keep looking."
5,Wonderful and full of taste!,"I am currently rehearsing for a performance of Sweeney Todd in Spain, so I have become an 'expert' in this play. Though some of the songs have been cut for this CD release, including most of the 'optional' material (beggar's lullaby, the tower of bray, parts from the contest), I think this is the most interesting Sweeney recording ever.Patti LuPone is just wonderful, Cerveris is the most accomplishing Todd in 'My friends', the adaptation of the orchestration is superb. A must hear -and see, if possible- to all fans of the world of musicals!"
1,Terrible and horrible.,"I'll break it down for you real easy like.This is a terrible movie that I thankfully rented. I give this zero stars because of that. The acting is terrible, the directing is terrible and the filming looks to be done by a hand held from the 80's.For all of you that love trashy flicks this will make the tops on your list easily."
3,Good tool,"I fell for everything I read about needing this specific spark plug socket when in there isn't anything special about it. It is basically a 9/16 spark plug socket with about a 4"" extension permanently attached.I was glad I had it because sometimes I did need the extra extension that I had, but all in all I probably could have saved my money and managed with my 9/16 spark plug socket and a separate extension which I already had.If you don't have 9/16 spark plug socket and an extension this is a good tool to buy, however if you already have both then I would save my money."
2,not worth the money,a spark plug socket is supposed to fit the top of the spark plug snug so you can safley place or take it out of the engine. The rubber insert either fell out or just didnt work. i had to pull the plugs ot with a needle nose. i just boght a 9/16 spark plug socket for 3 bucks and used my own extension. i would have been happy with the product if it had a better rubber insert or if it used magnets to hold the plug in.
5,Perfectly Designed,"Specifically designed for the F-150, this tool made short work of extracting the spark plugs on my 2007 F-150. Just make sure you are prepared to deal with broken plugs on the 5.4L Triton engine. Get the Lisle LIS65600 Kit to get the broekn plugs out of the head. Good product!"
3,"Sweet, not spicy","We enjoy all kinds of furikake. My kids love to put it on their rice, and in nori rolls.The name of this type of furikake is misleading. With Wasabi in the name, one would easily believe they were buying something with some kick. Not at all. This furikake is sweet, with a mild seaweed flavor. I prefer Nori Komi over this type, however, I still eat it. Regardless, I believe this sweeter furikake has it's place at the table. I simply use it sparingly.To really illustrate what the other negative reviewers are pointing out:Wasabi Fumi - 1 Tbsp = 2g sugarNori Komi - 1Tbsp = 1g sugarWasabi Fumi contains double the sugar of another popular type of furikake, also available on Amazon. I recommend buying several types and trying them all."
3,Try with tuna or chicken salad,"This is a good substitute for mayonnaise and sweet pickle when you're making tuna salad or chicken salad. Gives you that sweet and creamy taste that makes those salads so good, but without the extra fat and sugar."
5,Good stuff and no sugar or carbs,This is a badass dressing and you'd be hard pressed to find another dressing that tastes so good and has no calories or sugar.We love this on salads and we love to put this on our hamburgers to make some big mac copies.Give it a try you want be sorry.
1,"Cheap quality, Not that Good","This product is cheap, not worth the high price tag. My sprint Blue tooth was much better, heres why.This Motorola H670 Bluetooth rattles, the silver volume buttons are loose & cheaply installed into this product. The reception on the Motorola H670 Bluetooth connected to my Sprint Katana phone is marginal at best.After reading reviews I purchased this product. I am very disappointedwith the cheap quality & poor performance in all conditions.When I receive an inbound call the unit turns itself off prior so I have to wait for it to turn back on. It looks nice but it is a cheap piece of crap."
5,Spain's Most Celebrated Matador,"Two of my favorite actors in a movie - it can't go wrong. A Matador's Mistress is a dramatic film about the life of torrero known as Manolete. He fell in love with a prostitute despite the advice of the people who care for him. It was a volatile relationship where he was being pulled back and forth. Adrien Brody played the role of Manolete really well, sober, dignified, gallant. Penelope Cruz was impressive as Lupe, a seemingly disturbed woman who doesn't think she deserves his love. With the demands of his profession, the constant hostility between Lupe and his handlers, his leeching family, and the rise of other torreros, Manolete becomes emotionally distraught and puts himself in unnecessary danger. He dies trying to show he is better than the young upstart Luis. While he is dying, he kept calling for Lupe, who he named Mamita but people thought he was calling for his mother and she was never allowed to go near him. A sad film but a fitting tribute to Manolete."
5,"""A can't put down,action book""",This is one of the best books of action a have read. It talks about the differences from living in the city then living in the wilderness. Gary (the main character) takes a picture of a peculiar man and this man is willing to kill for that picture.
1,Terminal Boredom,"I have read all Reich's books and own most of them. What a disappointment this one was. I nearly drowned in forensic science, paperdoll characters, impossible situations, and though I kept thinking the book would get better and somehow the plot would finally jell, it didn't. This book has no ending. It just stops, as if Reich's ran out of paper so she called it a day. My personal opinion is that she is trying to write her own, but improbable version, of something like the DiVinci Code and just doesn't come close to making the grade."
1,"Really, REALLY dumb.","By far the worst entry in Reichs's Brennan series. She sets up a mystery central to the plot of the book - to whom did the bones discovered in Israel belong? The murders Brennan solves along the way are incidential to this overarching mystery. But at the end of the book (read no further if you don't want to get an idea of the ending!) the bones in question are totally destroyed, making it impossible to solve the question of whose they were. What a rip-off! And what a cheat on the reader!! It seems to me that Reichs just wasn't smart enough to think of a good ending. So she cheated and destroyed all the evidence. The only thing worse would have been for Brennen to awake back in Montreal and realize it was ""all a dream."""
2,Not Up to Her Usual Standards,"This is another Tempe Brennan and Andrew Ryan story, which is fine. What I didn't enjoy was all the technical and religious stuff that didn't really add much to the mystery for me, but then the mystery wasn't too great either.I liked the author's writing style this time, but didn't enjoy the story. I hope this book isn't a sign of things to come from Ms. Reichs."
3,NOT her usual book,"She is a great writer and took a little turn into the biblical world about 2,000 years ago. If you like religion and have some education of things Christian and biblical, you will probably like this far better than I. Usual characters -- in Israel this time. I'm looking forward to the next book however."
2,Not Pleased,This book was in poor condition. It had never been used but that was because all the pages were loose. The spine had not been glued to the pages properly.
2,Ho Hum,"Kathy Reichs is a solid writer and forensic anthropologist but this latest offering does not showcase any of her talents very well. Not very engaging, the characters and dialog lack dimension and the story line is less believable than it is sensational. In some respects it reminds me of an adult Nancy Drew.... Hopefully Kathy will return to her earlier style."
4,Cross Bones,"I have long been a fan of Kathy Reichs, this book reinforces that. Although it has undertones of ""The DaVinci Code"", it is still an entertaining read and one that will keep you interested."
2,DaVinci Code without the plot,"I have read all of Kathy Reich's books. Most of them get a bit tied up in the technical jargon, but this one went so far overboard that I had a hard time staying with the plot, such as it was. It never did get to anything that supports calling it a mystery. And the ending was a serious downer that I had fought to get to only to be seriously dissapointed. Ms. Reichs needs to return to the orignality that has been her hallmark instead of a take off on another book that sold well."
1,Not Reichs best work,"I have been an avid fan of Kathy Reichs and pre-ordered this book when I saw it on Amazon.com.I was VERY disappointed. It was confusing and confounding. Too many characters, too many theories, WAY too much religion and , Kathy, please don't preach to me!! I am a fan of your novels - not your political or religious positions!"
3,Oh well,"I'm a Kathy Reich Fan and it is my opinion that she usually writes great forensic thrillers. I had a hard time finishing this one though, I got confused with everything that was going on. I guess I just don't care enough for the subject at hand (Israel/Jesus). I got really bored with it halfway through. Hopefully the next one will play around Montreal again, the winters there are just perfect for some crime and digging!!!!"
3,Formulaic and not many surprises,"This eighth book in the Tempe Brennan series is not one of my favourites. I found that the book was almost textbook style, especially with the descriptions of bone and DNA science. There was an attempt to mix a very old past mystery with a new one, but I didn't think it really gelled. I also found the characters rather stiff and unbelievable. I usually love the Tempe Brennan series, so was disappointed with this one. In the book we have Tempe and Ryan travelling to the Holy Land in order to unravel a very ancient mystery, and to see how it relates to a very recent murder back in Canada. I think Tempe and her buddies do much better when they stick to their home turf. Let's hope we see her in Montreal or in North Carolina next time out."
2,No Temperance Here,"Ms. Reichs has lost the recipe, or at least the focus and formula that has brought her success prior to Cross Bones. Although not nearly as bad as P. Cornwell's last two or three misfires, Reichs is way wide of her usual high mark here. In this offering, Temperance is out of character, out of both style and focus, and the story is just overly convoluted and circuitous; a yarn that meanders around heading every which way except toward a finished product. Even the writing is unfamiliar and not of the same voice Reichs has maintained in her many Brennan novels. Having finally given up on Cornwell, after many years, I'll hang in there for one more Temperance Brennan dig; everyone is entitled to one gong."
5,Some shows just aren't for the masses...,"...which is why this show only lasted four seasons. Not every sketch is a hit, but this show provides many of the biggest laughs I have ever had watching a TV show. My personal favorites are: the one where the Buddhist colony competes against those spoiled rich kids from the fat camp, ""Probings: Monster Party Songs,"" and ""Monsters of Megaphone.""You don't have to be a stoner to appreciate all of this comedy, but sometimes it helps."
3,Overall Pretty Good product,It works well enough and it is nice that it is hidden in the tank but the slight complexity of connecting it and the tank becoming stained blue (I think they have clear now) makes me want to use a different product. Also you are forced to purchase only their refills and thats a downer for me.
3,An ok book.,"~ An ok book, but STILL not DUMB enough for this Complete Idiot! Too many TLA's [Three-Letter Acronmyns] throughout that keep one thumbing back and forth in a ""What did THAT mean again?"" search. On the PLUS side, it is about the best Linux book out there next to the ILLUSTRATED Linux guide. Go ahead and BUY it! ~ Lloyd W. Cary"
3,Kinda easy to understand,"the book was great, but there was a couple of things that could have been clearer like it should tell you how to install it better, in chapter 1 it starts like you already have it installed, I finally figured out it tells how to install it in the very back of the book, then it also dont go into real good detail on how to run it w/ windows. but other than that it's a great book."
2,Well i'll give it this,"Considering how bad the first one was I didn't expect its sequel to be any different. It wasn't combines the worst of all worlds, chessy soudtrack, chessy graphics and a missions operations manual that defifes all logic and reason."
2,Set phasers for boring,"First off, I am a huge Star Trek fan, and so I had to get this game. The problem is it's very boring. The starship design is fun, but limited to just a few classes. The mission phase is like watching paint dry...boring paint. Given the improvements in gaming technology, a new version of this game would be great. I know Star Trek Online gives you the chance to design your own starship, but some of us don't play online games. Just console and desktop games. As far as Star Trek: Starship Creator is concerned...I'm sorry, but I can not recommend."
4,Its a perforated drain cover or screen that works.,"Not much to say here. This is a cast iron screen or cover for a basement drain. Its made well, it fits, things dont fall through, and water still goes down the drain. The black paint is well done and shipping was prompt."
5,Very Unique,"I read Stlylemakers:inside fashion. I found the book fascinating in that I never knew there are so many people and personalities involved in a fashion company and its brand. The book is one of the most informative books I have read. It is a great guide for students going to fashion schools or entering the industry. Also, it is a fun book to read!!!"
4,I bought it for parts!,"I bought it only for parts.I like my Sony Ericsson Wireless Stereo HeadphoneSony Ericsson Wireless Stereo Headphone - Black. However, when I work out in the gym, I have trouble keeping them in my ears. So I imagined I could have a light overhead headphones to attach the wireless bluetooth headphone to and hopefully the clutch mechanism would keep earbuds in my ears.Well this solution works - after I removed both headphones from the original plastic bars and fixed my Sony Ericsson earbuds in them."
3,They don't make them like this anymore!!,One of the first games on the Sega CD system. They don't make them like this anymore!!
5,Super satisfied mom,"My husband and I purchased the whole set which included the crib, combo unit and chest. The pieces are pricey however our angel is worth it. All the pieces are made from a good sturdy wood. Purchasing these pieces are an investment because of the high quality. These are pieces my daughter can take to her first apartment. I would recommend the whole set to anyone looking for quality furniture."
3,wedding cd review,"I bought this cd for one song only, I used it as the father-daughter dance song at my daughter's recent wedding. Honestly, I haven't even listened to the rest of it."
3,Not a very bad version of TZ. Just wasn't good enough.,"This was not such a bad revival of UPN's Twilight Zone which BTW is now syndicated weekly. There were alot of episodes in this series that was so bizzare and poor written. For example in episode, ""Last Lap"" There was this guy who was terminally ill and died after a test race with his friend. When the ill guy survived, the bizzare emotions happened to him and he realized that he was the one that was supposed to die. Then in the flashback the reversal had happened to him.So in short, it is a good show, but not really as good as the original Twilight Zone series."
2,Almost unwatchable ...,"I know that this is a product that has always been marketed to a ""tween"" audience who had never seen the original series. However, I've seen almost the entire run of the original TZ and I know what these kids are missing.This whole series shows such a lack of creativity, no originality, no innovation, and poor to fair acting. It's an injustice to even have this branded with the TZ logo. All the attributes that made the original series so relevant and important are either flat-out missing or just so poorly copied that each episode seems like a parody.If the series cost (significantly) less I could maybe justify trying it out, but at close to fifty dollars I'll take Collection One of the Rod Serling era every single time."
4,Better than I expected,I've just finished watching the 2002 series of Twilight Zone and was pleasantly surprised.Although Forest Whittaker is not a patch on Rod Serling the production quality and most of the story-lines are excellent.This series is well worth a look for the TZ officianado and new fans alike.
3,Larger size connector than older version,"I have an older Etrex handheld GPS and the 12V power cord went bad. I ordered this one since it is an Etrex cord to find the connector for the GPS was much larger. I didn't think it would slide into place but by firmly pushing it on, it does work. So, it works, but it isn't the same as the older version."
5,A real steal,"You've probably read all of the other reviews, so I won't get into what the show is about. I'll just say that if you like action cartoons from the early 90's, you might very likely enjoy this show. If you can ignore the inaccuracies to the games, just enjoy the show the way it is. Of course, what really made me want to pick this up is the sheer amount of...episodes. 13 half hour episodes is DEFINITELY worth the money."
4,Well Written,"This is a well written, well organized book for touring the SW ruins. It gives brief overviews of the various cultures and then provides travel/hike guidance. Very good first book to go to when planning a ancient SW civilizations based SW tour."
5,Can a dog be a hero?,"Would you belive that a dog would help a squirrel instead of chasing the squirrel? Well belive it or not, in the story ""Gooesbeery Park"", a dog named Kona has a friend named Stumpy that is a squirrel. When a terrible storm hits Gooseberry Park, Kano begins to think that Stumpy and her newborn babies are in deep trouble. Kano goes on the most dangerous adeventure for Stumpy.He will have to go through the most difficult part. That is to go throught the ice cold park. Will he be able to do this in time? He will just have risk anything just for his best friend! Will Kano make make it to Stumpy before the weather gets worser or will he fail his adventure? Who knows what will happen to Kano?"
3,It's OK.,The clock and indoor temp works great but the outdoor sensor does not work properly. If your serious about the out door info look else where.
2,Excellent except for time zone problem,"I've had this for several years and found it to be excellent except for a recent problem with the time zone. I set it to EST every day and it is reset to PST the next morning. Setting it to GST worked for about a year, but now it resets to PST no matter what time zone I set it to. I couldn't find anyway to disconnect the automatic update. Different room placements don't help. The outside temperature reading has been reliable. I would rate this as a 5 if I could fix the time zone problem."
2,"A ""rainy day"" movie.","Starring: Ian Buchanan, Jennifer Gatti, James McEachin, William R. Moses, Ron Perlman, Dedee Pfeiffer.A jealously possessive husband (Buchanan) finds that his ""girl in cotton wool"" wife (Gatti) is having an affair. He has a contract put out on the mystery boyfriend but the hit is botched and his wife is killed instead. Now he wants both the mystery boyfriend and the hit man dead...but who the ""mystery boyfriend"" and ""hit man"" turn out to be....This is TV movie quality with a nice twist at the end (50-50 chance you'll guess it). Has some semi graphic sex scenes.Ron Perlman has a supporting role (but top billing!) as a private investigator with secrets both past and present, and he gives his usual solid performance.Favorite line(s): spoken by the husband to his and his wife's friend: ""You would tell me if she were having an affair, wouldn't you?"" her reply: ""Would I tell her if you were having an affair?"""
3,Tonka Mighty Crane,"The problem with this truck is that the claw can't hold anything. My son was disappointed because he wanted to clip things in the claw and move them around. The truck is sturdy, but not that great of a toy."
5,My 2 year old LOVES LOVES this!,Bought the dump truck 6 months ago and my 2 year old plays with it non-stop. Brought the crane and bull dozer for his birthday (2). He has not taken his hands off it since we got it out of the box!! Love these trucks and highly recommend!!
5,EVER??,"Let's just say it's the ONLY one so far that's universal in scope (but see my caveat at amazon.co.uk). A Day for a Lay's international coverage is patchy in the extreme, capricious even, and anyway it only covers men. Time to be all-embracing, I feel; in the meantime we'll just have to make do (!) with David Lehman's glorious 'best erotic' anthology, which is all-American but in every possible combination."
4,O Say can you See By James W Moore,Our Sunday School class uses Dr. Moore's books to read a chapter and review together each Sunday. This is the fourth of his books we have used. This book is strong in very good illustrative stories to develop the scripture used and to help Dr Moore make his emphasis for the scripture.
3,uneven,"To be honest, I only heard a few of the Shostakovich symphonies in this collection. Haitink's performance of the first is terrible. His version of the 13th and 14th are o.k. and his 12th did not make me change my mind that it is the least of Shostakovich's symphonies. Eugene Ormandy's performance of the 1st is the one to beat. Bernstein's 5th and 9th and Karajan's 10th remain unsurpassed."
5,Somebody send the amber lamps!!!! Epic Beard Man.,Danny Trejo rocks. The most fun I have had watching a movie in the last 6 months. If you enjoy a goodbutt kicking movie where the good guys beat up the bad guys this movie is for you. Its also funny andhas heart. Danny Trejo is a great leading man with tons of charisma. He should be the the Dos Equis guy.Can't wait for the sequel to this.
4,it's great,My 8 year old likes it even more than the 3 year old. Easy to put together and durable. I think the price makes it a great bargain- but I know I will be buying the large set soon enough! Quite worth the money.
3,Interesting but not too stimulating,It is a nice toy to play for a short time as the train keeps going around.My two year old son enjoys the 'stop and go' feature and the toy made him learn what these words mean.I still think the wooden tracks are more exciting than the battery operated ones!However my assumptions are based on how my child liked it but remember it could be different for every child.
2,Not what I was expecting,"I was expecting a more detailed book on VS 2005, but it wasn't. However some people might find this book useful."
1,Unwarranted anticipation,I have eaten in the restaurant and on reading the reviews decided to purchase the book.First of all I got the impression the reviews were written by Mr.Parkers family members as none of them had previously bought a cookbook before as indicated on the bottom of the screen.His food could never be compared to the great Le Bernadin's or Aquagrill's and you feel he knows this so instead the restaurant is run like the equivalent of a steak house.The book wasn't as informative as I would have liked but recipes where clear and precise.For the most part it was mediocre just like his food.
3,Nice Boot..............Bad foot pain,"I purchased these boots at a much cheaper price elsewhere. I am used to wearing high heels, so this is not a problem for me. The problem is in the leather itself. Very hard material = PAIN!!! These are not as comfortable as the numerous other boots I have from Nine West. As other reviewers have stated they are very sexy so I'm not sure I want to send them back but I am afraid they won't stretch any time soon."
2,NOT GOOD BY:ANNE KID 7 1st grade,"Once I looked at the picture of Rainbow and Sprinkles I thought it would be terribly fun. When I got it I didn't let anybody play with it. And the wings didn't fall off very much. After a while I got bored playing with them. Mostly now only my friends play with them. When I used the sprinkles it made a big mess. Rainbow's wings bent, I lost Sprinkles,and I got black spots on the front of Rainbow. I don't think I'll ever play with them. I spent mony for Rainbow horse and Sprinkles just to find out thetI didn't like Rainbow horse and Sprinkles. Find Sunflower and seehow much I liked her better then Rainbow and Sprinkles. I hope you don't buy Rainbow horse and Sprinkles. Have a good day shopping at www.amazon.com bye Anne"
5,Great Accessory For Sailor Moon,My 5-year-old daughter has begged for this horse each time she saw it. She loves Sailor Moon and this is an excellent alternative for the very costly imported Sailor Moon unicorn. It is just the right size for Barbie or Sailor Moon dolls.
5,Every new motorcyclist should have this book,"It's chock-full of information, with answers for all those ""stupid"" questions you're too embarassed to ask anybody else. Plus, great general info on basic repairs and maintenance."
3,Soul thief,I enjoy Cecelia Holland's books and this is a fine example but the kindle editions of her books contain many typos that make reading distracting.
3,its almost any brand but tissot,"Tissot has a name for long time before i was born, but this particular model looks and feel cheaper than the actual photo, for this price i would reconsider and buy other brand name..."
2,makes for a long read,"I am a big fan of the author and the topic so I was quite enthusiastic upon starting the book. However, Mr. Thomas seems to get too caught up in irrelevant characters and storylines. He misses some major events completely as well. EG: When Columbus returned to the islands on his second voyage, the sailors he left there were killed. This was missed entirely and instead we got 2 pages worth of what Ferdinand was doing. It seemed to be more of a story about Spain than of the explorers. Not recommended."
2,"A fascinating story, a flawed telling","Thomas subject is a fascinating one of discovery, royalty, conquest, cultures and their subsequent clashes and wars, but as others have noted, there is way too much petty detail that hampers the narrative flow. Mr. Thomas' Christian-European prejudices are indeed blatant but the importance of the history of the New World is undisputed and the writer provides an interesting persepective. Editors please!"
3,useless info overload,"thomas is very well educated and writes well. but, he uses so many proper names of people and places of unheard of people and places all interconnected. some sentences contain 4 proper names. he forgets what is so special and fascinating about the whole process of discovery of the americas for all the details. some people may want this? yould have to have a Ph D in latin american studies or catholicism!"
4,"5 stars for research, 3 stars for readability","Rivers of Gold is thoroughly researched and documented, but at times the author loses sight of the forest for the trees. Several chapters are written in an engaging style, particularly those focusing on Columbus' arrival in the New World and the sections on Mesoamerican cultures. However (as is pointed out in other reviews), the author seems to dwell on accounting for everyone who had even the most minor role in the exploration of the Americas. It takes a while to navigate all these names, many of which merit one mention with no connection to later events or consequences. That said, Rivers of Gold is a useful text for serious students of this key historical period."
2,Vastly Overrated,"Problems With The Book:1) Way too much detail about minor characters, places, and customs which lead nowhere; where was the editor on this project?2) Minor errors. For example on page 283 compare the text and map illustrating where Ponce de Leon first made landfall in Florida (hint: it wasn't near modern day Palm Beach). Also, on page 529, hurricanes being included among the disasters afflicting Seville; this has never happened.3) Most egregiously, an incredibly hazy story line told dully with almost zero context.I came away frustrated and extremely disappointed. I can't understand the rave reviews; this is a vastly overrated book."
3,Be Careful,"A good combination of spices, but be very careful! The first time I used it in a recipe, I was not sure of the flavors that it would impart, so I used only a shake. But that was still way too much and the lavender overpowered the dish, making it almost unedible. I think the maker should really cut down or eliminate that spice altogether! The jar is quite large so I am sharing it with the warning of ""use very little"". Even then, I have no idea how I will ever be able to use it all."
5,Cleo Hangers,hana_market (1462)I would certainly purchase from hana_market again! The Cleo Hangers were exactly what I had been searching for! I have a two year old female Chihuahua named Bodacious who I enjoy dressing every chance I have. Therefore I love having her closet well organized! The hangers fit her clothing perfectly. I greatly appreciate the quick shipment on all 4 items I won bids on! THANKS AGAIN HANA_MARKET!!!
3,Book club choice,"I purchased this book to read with my book club. It wasn't my cup of tea, all the flashing back and forth was too confusing and I didn't care for the subject matter. Others in my group loved it though."
3,not for non-computer literate senior,"I bought this for my mother. The user interface wastes a lot of flash on back grounds that don't add anything to the game. The user interface is confusing and inconsistent. Getting started shouldn't be a memory challenge. The activities them selves are good, but it's too cumbersome for no reason to get to them."
3,false advertisement of titles included on cd,"I am very happy with the songs that are on this cd, however I purchased it to have a copy of THE MAGIC SCARF which is listed on the information amazon shows us about this product. The library copy I purchased only has 13 songs instead of the 18 listed here and of course the magic scarf is missing!!! I really wanted that song in particular for my scarf play program in my daycare home.I am very dissappointed.Rosie"
5,The most wonderful book on professional labour market,"That's one of the most clarifying books about professionalism I 've ever read. I couldn't put the book down, specially the chapter shededicates to medical profession, where shebrillantly points out their characteristics ina generalizing way.Luiz Felipe Pinto (felipe@ensp.fiocruz.br), Rio deJaneiro, Brazil"
2,loudest RC I've ever seen...,"I guess I should start with positive... who am I kidding. It moves quickly, but it makes a lot of noise. Also, out of the box this toy's launcher didn't work (it just made a loud crack every time it ""tried"" to shoot) Plus, it takes 5 and a half hours to charge. I bet Marty Stevens has stock in Tyco or something like that. Think about it, Marty's the only person who got a N.S.E.C.T. that works perfectly. So don't waste money and time(and the eletric bill charging it)on this toy. I'm being nice giving it 2 stars."
2,Firing problems,"If you are wondering about the missle firing problems, be sure to read the reviews on the Green nsect bug here in Amazon. Both robots have had this problem, although other problems seem to be rare. Mine did not fire the missles right out of the box. However, with liberal return policies, I was able to return the defective unit and will keep buying until I find one that works. The kid loves it, but is very disappointed at the gun not working. The missles are NOT the problem. TYCO re-supply missles will not help the problem... nor will ANY foam missle (I have scores of them in my house from other toys) fire from a flawed cannon. When I returned mine yesterday ($109 with tax from Target) I received full credit and was told they had several in other Target stores and were liquidating them at $19.99. However, I can only wonder if these are working units or returns...."
4,Strong Toy,I got this toy for my grandson for Christmas. I was surprised when it arrived because of the quality of the merchandise. It is a fun toy to play with and very very sturdy.
4,Performs As Advertised,"The N.S.E.C.T. does just what was advertised. It is noisy, particullary on hardwood floors. The projectiles do launch 20 feet or more and we adults enjoy playing with it as well as the kids. I will say that older kids (7 plus years) seem to get a little bored with it quickly. It is a little slow and it only walks, shoots, grabs and the eyes light up. Now, I think that's quite a lot, but kids don't seem to think so. The item was delivered on time as promised in new condidion."
2,Fun for a very little while.,This was the only thing my 6 year old wanted for his birthday/Christmas. He asked for gift cards from all of his friends so he could save enough to buy it. He absolutely loved it when it first came but a week later couldn't care less. It is VERY noisy and it is hard to find items for it to pick up. It is a cool toy but not worth the money.
2,What a let down!,"For the price of this item when it first came out last year, I really expected great things. It was not anywhere near the claims it makes on the box. It was clunky, barely walked well, the remote control didn't pick up signals well, the gun would come up but wouldn't fire. My son played with it for all of two times before he was bored and never played with it again. If you spend money on remote control creatures - go with a roboraptor....much better quality for the money."
3,Not what I expected for the money,These fit decent in our e350 but had to do some trimming so they did not dig up the dog box seals. I also did not expect a hard plastic mat for this price on 2 mats. The edges are just turned stright up in place not very finished looking and easy to catch your feet on. They do stay in place well and hold mud and water but I have been alot happer weathertech. These also came checked like diamond plate no ribs like in the photos. If you cant find anything better these will sever their purpose
4,It works!,"Although the ""view"" through the scope is small and requires some getting used to, this tool does work well to look into small and obscure places. I have used it mostly just to inspect the piston heads on my outboard motor and car, and for general building work looking behind wall sheeting to find obstructions etc."
1,"Java For Dummies-""Don't buy this book!""","Boring to read with no real life applications. The reviews cannot possibly be real. The reviews mislead me into buying it, and now I am stuck with it taking up space on my bookshelf. Don't waste your money....."
2,"Once over,","I think this book is just an overview of the most common used functions, since I didn't really understand the basics. I got another book to go into detail. I'm assuming you got to have knowledge of another programming language to understand it better, but I didn't come out learning much."
3,Disk from the book had a Trojan,"Would have liked this book better if the CD included with the book had not had a Trojan virus in it. Could not, would not, install anyhing from the CD.Book was useful reading"
1,Not good for teens.,This book makes the same mistake as so many books on programming. It jumps into specifics of the language and totally lacks any practical applications. My teens put it down after a few chapters and didn't learn anything. What would make it awesome is if they had little a exercise at the end of each unit to help glue down the concepts covered.
3,Needs more hands-on,"I am a hands-on type of guy and really wanted more practice and exercises. It was well written, but without being to apply it immediately, some went in one ear and out the other. It would make a good supplement if you already know code or have a another book, but I do not think it works well as a 1 stop shop for a complete beginner."
4,A bridge over troubled waters.,"This concise and well-written summary of ways to interpret evidence of variations and errors in New Testament text is well balanced in its approach. It finds the sweet spot between claims of literal inerrancy of Biblical text and a conclusion that any errors render the NT irrelevant. For readers such as myself who reject both extremes, it offers support in our spiritual searches and continuing access to the truths and wisdom found in the Bible. The author and publisher are to be commended for seeking a nuanced approach and offering a bridge to those not already entrenched in one side or the other."
3,"Tehama Women's Drama Driving Shoe,Black Croc,7 M","I liked the shoe. It's a little narrow, but stylish."
2,Not What I Expected,"While this sweater is quite pretty, I found it poorly made. The yarn used was thin, there was raveling in several places around the hems, and the tail loop got completely in the way, if you know what I mean. An inferior product to be blunt, even when based solely upon the poor quality of the yarn."
2,Very difficult to drain,I filled it to the lower rib .it took over 2hours to drain the pump only holds 2.5 gallons which meant many trips to empty. Not safe unless you have two people for severe helpless patient plus the pillow floated out from my daughters head.
4,Una Historia Muy Descriptiva,"Cuatro primas se reunen en sus vacaciones de verano en la casa del pueblo que pertenece a la matriarca de la familia, cada una de ellas el resto del año lo desarrolla de una manera muy diferente a la otra, y aun asi en este periodo vacacional y por el resto de sus vidas tienen un lazo muy fuerteLa autora nos invita a participar en esta historia de una manera descriptiva tal cual parece que somos vecinos,el final..... fantastico! con ganas de estar presente y ser parte del desenlace !!!!"
5,Amazing,I've seen a few reviews that state that none of the ender books are as good as the first one. This really surprised me. As far as I am concerned this series represents the only series I can think of where the books get better and better. The ideas become so much more complex but you completely fall in love with the characters and the plot is good throughout the first 6 books. The spin offs that follow are not quite as good. They are more action oriented like Ender's Game and they are worth reading but it's the philosophy that really amazes me.
4,An essential pickup for any science fiction fan!,"Nice to see that Card and company packaged all the rest of the Ender Quarter into a box-set. The average customer saves about $7 and you can finish the entire series. However, price and convienence are not the only things that are great about this box set. Speaker For The Dead, Xenocide, and Children Of The Mind are all very different than Ender's Game, but very good reads to follow up the original with. Whether you are a casual fan of science fiction or a hard core fan of Card, all of the remaining books in this set will do well to quench the thirst of the reader. If you haven't read Ender's Game yet, then none of these books will make much sense even though Card meant for Speaker For The Dead is meant to be standalone. It really is better to start with Ender's Game, you won't be sorry after reading these 3 books + Ender's Game.-Travis S."
3,Whew!,"Very detailed study of the origins and arguments for yoga. Not a book for beginners, and certainly not a How-to."
5,Canine Plus Senior Vitamins,"Cookie, an 11 1/2 year old Chocolate Lab, has been taking Canine Senior Plus vitamins for the last few years. She is healthy and people who see her cannot believe she is as old as she is."
5,Great for my older greyhound,"I've been giving these vitamins to my 9 1/2 year old greyhound for a few months and they definitely seem to improve his energy level and appetite. I feed a raw diet and I was concerned he might be lacking in vitamins/minerals so I decided to add the Canine Plus Senior to his meals. I like the fact that in addition to the vitamins and minerals, they also have a variety of other nutrients, such as digestive enzymes."
2,TOO COMPLICATED,"Unfortunately, the only chapter do address the 9 natural laws of leaderhsip is the first one...after that, the author moves into the quantum leadership theory for the remaining part of the book. The book is filled with great information but is is buried deep within complicated, over-technical sentences. The author seems to be out to impress other authors with his use of $10 words than to get a worthwhile set of information to the reader. It is very unfortunate since there is very good info in this book but it is soooo hard to get to it. He should try to write this book over again and let a normal person read it first before publishing it! Don in Denver."
5,The best craft book ever written!,"I really enjoy this book because I don't like crafts that require sewing. This book has so many practical and easy crafts that are so elegant and actually ""do-able."" I would recommend this book to any craft lover! It makes you really look forward to the holiday season."
3,"Great ideas, but who has the time?","This book has some really fun looking ideas! There is something for every season and most of the crafts appear manageable. However, if you are not Martha Stewart and don't have hours upon hours to sit and create cutesy crafts, this book may not be for you. The projects will take some time - uninterrupted - or you may find yourself having to start over again. Also, many of the projects are not to be used around children (breakable or flammable - sometimes both). However, many of these crafts are very adorable and I would love to incorporate them into my home some day!"
2,Narrative of the Course Work,"Very useful topic, my industry is going from growth into maturity and the importance of consultative selling is becoming more important everyday.I found it to be more of a narrative of the coursework rather than a book a sales person or sales manager could learn from by himself."
2,very disappointed on Christmas Day!@#$%^&*,"I to have bought my last ""TYCO"" product of any kind after seeing the disappointment in my grandson eyes ,and to top it off nobody around here anywhere has one. This is terrible!"
1,Very Disappointed,"I was extremely disappointed to find out after I bought the toy for my son that I had to buy a seperate battery pack and charger that incidentally cost MORE than the toy itself. Not only does the store I bought the toy from not carry the battery pak, but neither does any store in the surrounding area. I just now had to order the battery online and pay extra shipping and handling to get it delivered in a decent amount of time. It is now 2 1/2 weeks after Christmas and my son is still not able to play with what Santa brought him. A huge disappointment. At least sell the battery packs at the same location you sell the toy."
1,Not fair,"I am sure the toy is great, but the battery pack is sold seperately and is half the cost of the toy. This is not obvious until you try to put the thing together, and discover that you will be soaked for another 30.00. Not fair to the customer. I took it back."
2,Expensive battery pack and doesn't hold charge long,"We purchased a Tyco RF controlled vehicle only to find out after we had given it as a present that it required this separate battery pack. Guess that the packaging does say so in the fine print but didn't realize it at the time. This battery pack and charger were a third again the cost of the toy. It takes several hours to fully charge then doesn't last very long so needs to be recharged often. Since the battery runs out often, the kids loose interest or end up playing with toy manually, just pushing it around. I'm sure it will break shortly because of this and toy/battery/charger will end up in garbage shortly."
3,"Hook, line and sinker...","Most reading this review already share the disappointment of purchasing the Rewinder and then having to search high and low for the FlexPak. After purchasing the Rewinder (and the 9V battery), I found myself entering the post-holiday madness to locate the elusive FlexPak. Target sold the toy, but not the FlexPak, Radio Shack has a multitude of R/C batteries, but none would work. As another reviewer mentioned, the cost of the batteries equals the cost of the Rewinder. I would have rather been spared the time, trouble, and aggravation by having Tyco simply mark up the price and include the battery -- especially given its apparently limited availability."
1,TYCO Blew it!!!,"We had the same Christmas Day disaster. The REWINDER was at the top of my son's list. I gave my mom the ""hint"", so Grandma could be the bomb. She wasn't very happy with my suggestion when we realized my son would not be playing with his new toy anytime soon. We have been all over town searching for the battery pack....Walmart, Target, Toys R Us, and even Radio Shack.......Not one of these stores in the Ft. Lauderdale area has it. Needless to say, by now my son has lost interest, and it is going back. Tyco toys will not be coming into this household anytime soon."
1,The battery pack shown for this toy is the WRONG ONE.,"I can't give a true review....... I have NO idea concerning the rating questions. My grandson can't play with it.....the toy won't work with the wrong battery pack & I am having a hard time getting the situation corrected through Amazon.com.The battery pack for this RC & for the Terrain twister are the wrong ones. They are SWITCHED. Thus, when I ordered the Terrain Twister (with the battery pack shown, it was the WRONG ONE. Terrain Twister uses: TMH Flexpak Battery Pack and Charger. Shell Shocker uses The Tyco Proflex Battery Pack & Charger and one 9-volt battery. So......... be VERY CAREFUL what you order."
1,Sum of the parts < whole?,"Agree with above -I had already purchased toys for nephews as gifts. They are brothers and would've been able to share the same battery pack, if Tyco would sell batteries separately. I'll make sure not to do this again to another parent!"
4,Accidentally saw it when first released and liked it. Still like it.,"In some city working and had a night free so went to movie theater and bought a ticket for??? Walked into theater and sat down. Movie starts and after a couple of minutes realized not the film I came to watch but so interesting, kept with it. Thought at the time that ""gangs"" of NY a little overdone, exaggerated, but point was made and had to cheer for the under dogs as they move through the side streets of NY. If nothing else a great period piece now on the streets of New York City. Liked all the characters, acting. Certainly not a romantic date movie and probably not a wife viewing movie, but many will like this movie, action, plot, fight scenes. Recommend."
1,Clunky and hard to use,I bought this to replace a GPS map kit I bought from Delorme that was not Vista compatible. Straight out of the box 2007 would not work and they forced me to pay full price for the 2008 upgrade. The software is clunky and hard to use. I would recommend Streets and Trips from Microsoft over this product.
2,Lacking Updates,"I moved near the Hilton Head Island Sun City and ordered Street Atlas 2008 to update my five year old 2003 edition. Sun City and the surrounding town have doubled in size in the last five years, but Street Atlas has not added a single new street to the area in that time. Also, mislabeled roads have not been corrected.I returned it to Delorme."
3,Too hard to Maneuver,"I have had this program in the past as well as Microsoft Streets and Trips, and i have always used the Streets and Trips more, it is easier to Maneuver around and find things. Yesterday I was using this program trying to find hotels in Las Vegas, and it would not list them without doing a bunch of hunting and searching to get them to appear. With Streets and Trips you go to Las Vegas and look up and down the stip and all the hotels are there and easy to find. i only bought this Delorme this year because they said that they had updated it and it was all better, well it is not. I will not purchase Delorme Street Atlas again, I will just continue to purchase the Microsoft Streets and Trips which will be out in August. thanks"
2,Out of date maps,None of the changes made in my county the last three or four years are shown in the maps including the extension of a four lane highway.Its OK if you live in old stable areas and you don't mind the map being so out of date.
5,Great toy for little Thomas fans,"Okay, yes this toy tips over but what pull toy doesn't. I don't find that it tips any more than any of her other similar toys. Yes it makes train noises, but it has an off switch if you don't like them, but that is 2/3 of the fun of it. Not only does my dd love this toy but it has always been popular at playdates even now that she is almost 3 and some of her friends are 4, it is still played with often."
5,thomas the tank engine pull-along,My son will be 4 next month and he has had this for 2 years now. He still plays with it along with his other Thomas toys on a daily basis. Yes it falls over but it has not stopped him from enjoying it one bit. My 20 month old daughter loves it too! My kids think it is a great toy and so do I.
3,I'm ready to give it away...,"Don't get me wrong, some kids would love this. Those are the kids that learned patience and persistance at birth. This train is always tipping over and my 2 year old has a fit. The string is pretty short (for safety purposes, I'm sure) so he tends to lift it off the ground while pulling it too. That also brings on fits. It is easily righted when it tips, but he just can't handle it yet. Also, the sounds get on my nerves."
3,Head Hunter,"for a B movie, it really wasnt bad, reminded me of some of the 80's spook flicks that came out when i was in high school... BUT i REALLY enjoyed the soundtrack !!! that guitar-ish sounding piece that is thru out the film is really awesome... i never heard of the composer BUT was wondering if there was a soundtrack available ???"
4,Please Note For Thong Underwear,"The description on this isn't clear that this product is for thong underwear.from Naturacare's site. ""Natracare Tanga panty liners with wings are designed for thong/tanga style underwear. The liners are made with certified organic cotton and totally chlorine-free, plant cellulose and are plastic free to allow your delicate skin to breath and stay dry.""I like the Naturacare Breathable liners a lot"
4,Insightful and very reader-friendly,"With this collection of essays, rants, and email responses sent to her website, ""The Happy Heretic"", Hayes has constructed a book on atheism/freethought/civil liberties that is by turns hysterically funny and appallingly tragic.From tales of people seeing the Virgin Mary in a waffle to the Pope declaring that ""Gravity Exists!"" Hayes explores the lengths to which people will go to in order to satisfy their hunger for a ""miracle"". On the darker side, the author submits personal accounts of people in her own life that have sacrificed their freedoms, intellect, and even the safety of their own children in order to be a part of a religious system that offers to do the thinking for them.One does not need to be an atheist to get something out of this book. Hayes' attack isn't on God; but rather on the crimes perpetuated by people who claim a form of ""divine right"" to force their beliefs on others."
1,The Happy Heretic Was Not Happy,"Judy Hayes shot herself to death in June of 2012. Her personal life was non-existent as she wrote off all of her family, one at a time, until it was just she and her second husband, Pat, on an isolated mountain top in Valley Springs, California. She never even met three of her four grandchildren. Wrote that she wished she'd never had kids. They were good kids who were abused by their stepfather. The problem was she was mentally off balance and her rational moments were devoted to writing not personal relationships. Her family was trying until the end to reach her to no avail and the Coroner in Calaveras County said ""she could sound so sane...."""
2,A cartoon,A cartoon. See Operation Thunderbolt with Klaus Kinski for the definitive version of this story.
5,Francois is THE MAN!,As per usual-this is another wonderful offering from the Verlinden clan. The dioramas are phenomenal as well as the figures.This book expounds on the methods described in volume 1 as well as showing how to obtain the 'Verlinden Way' on some new subjects. The painting and weathering is dealt with in an in-depth way that even the novice will find approachable. I still find new ideas after 5 years of steady modelling.A great book!
1,Not the same scent!,Red Door is my favorite scent. I've used it for years. But this particular bottle is not the same. I saw someone else state that this smelled different in the 3.3 ounce compared to the 1.7 and smaller bottles. I thought they had to be mistaken. But they were right. This bottle does not smell the same.
2,Great Scent but..........,"The problem with this scent is that its getting WEAKER AND WEAKER BY THE YEAR!!!!!!! I have to apply this three times a day now where back in the nineties I only had to apply it once and that was it. Im not spending my hard earned money on something that I have to use 3X as much to get the same effect of what used to be. Im not the only one who is noticing this WEAK AND WATERED DOWN VERSION OF PERFUME these days. Elizabeth Arden is trending this way with all the perfumes now. Someone noticed this in 5th Avenue perfume too! I will not be buying another bottle of this thats for sure. Good luck Elizabeth Arden, women do know the difference!!!!!!!"
4,Good Charger,I use it to charge my two 12 volt trolling motor batteries hooked up in series.Charger does a good job.Only knock: it is very noisy. Amazon was Great-1st charger was defective & they replaced it w/ no hassles.Their price for 24volt charger was best by far.
1,Noisiest Toy,"My 9-year old was estatic. The rest of us whom are 50+ grew weary quite early of the extremely loud operation of this toy. On vinyl floors it is nerve-wracking. Although it is a very clever design, with the Nerf darts which come out as a surprise, it is a strickly 'down in the playroom only' type toy. Oddly, it does NOT fare well out on the grass which is interesting as its is suppose to be an insect. And, the 'don't go across puddles' warning seems not well thought out on the part of the engineers of the toy.Operation of the toy is simple enough and not difficult to get use to. Howver, just like the ending credits for a TV production firm-- ""Bad Robot""."
3,Extremely noisey!,"Like a lot of other reviewers here, I have to say this thing is noisey. On hard floors it's legs hit the floor hard and loud, but even on carpet the machine is still a little noisey with the moving that it does. But other than that it does pretty well! I'm very surprised that it actually does what it says it will, a bunch of toys out there do not."
2,Defective firing mechanism,"I purchased this RC NSECT for my son for Christmas. Initially looked great out of the box. It is large and looks somewhat intimidating. Movement is fine, and the remote control is logical. Unfotunately, the darts would not fire; it just makes a clicking noise. I contacted Mattel, who told me that the wrong dats were sent with the unit, and that they would ship out the correct ones to rectify the problem (apparently over 3 million had already been sent). Needless to say, the new darts did not improve perfomance, and I ended up returning the product to Amazon. A little quality control from Mattel could prevent disappointing some kids over the holidays"
2,"I got one of the N.S.E.C.T 's with the ""dart problem""","The dang bug runs and closes its jaws but won't shoot darts (just clacks, yes they are pushed in all they way). I don't want to manually glue stuff on there. Web research shows Mattel shipped units with the wrong sized darts (supposed to the the ""black ones""). Allegedly Mattel will ship the darts free if you can get hold of them...-Dave"
3,FYI,"Just so you know i think the reason why 9 Crimes wasn't included in the soundtrack was because of the lyrics. It's a kids movie remember. The lyrics talk about cheating and uses the analogy of a gun and how the reciprocated offense is like pulling the trigger and if it's Alright to do the same. It's a beautiful yet very sad song. I don't think Dreamworks would care if you chose to find that song elsewhere yourself. Then again, the artist may appreciate it more if you go out and get his CD."
3,Not As Good As The First 2 CD's,"The CD is good, but in my opinion, it's not as good as the first 2 Shrek movie CD's."
1,Nothing beats the original,"The original Shrek Soundtrack was the best soundtrack ever. I still listen to it and it has a permanent slot in my car's cd player. The 2nd soundtrack blew. The 3rd? Eh. I haven't bothered. 9 Crimes by Damien Rice, however, is a great song. The woman singing in it is Lisa Hannigan and the song is available as a CD single and as one of the tracks on his ""9"" CD."
4,A future classic,"Sadly todays music industry is one of PR hype, smoke and mirrors, Style and no content, beautiful people with no soul,wannabe's who seek fame rather than the perfect song, and people who make music just to be cool.Gladly keane is none of the above, just a really talented new group who have made an album that will stand the test of time, and this coming from a person who wouldn't normally give this type of music a second glance.These guys are superb, and their debut album ""Hopes and fears"" will stand the test of time, and cement them in th hearts of any real music fan who listens without prejudice."
4,So easy to listen to,I have just recently discovered Keane and love their music. After listening to song samples on Amazon I decided to buy this one as my first CD of theirs but will buy more I'm sure.
5,A favorite in my collection,"This is cd has several songs that I really enjoy on it. I also have their ""Under the Iron Sea"" which is another that has some great songs."
5,A Great Debut,"First off, This is a great debut, from some very talented artists. If there are comparisons to be made, (and by the other reviews I have read we all have an opinion) I would say that the songwriting on this album reminds me a lot of ""Queen.""However to compare this band to any other band would be a terrible injustice to this great new album (CD?). I purchased this recording based on the opening track and I was not dissapointed. Great melodies ! (unheard of these days) and fine vocal & musical talent, set this band apart from many others.I hope they don't tinker with thier sound and continue to produce a lasting body of work that pleases the music lovers of the world for many years to come. Cheers!"
2,Last Thing,"Rodolfo, from San Francisco.Maybe you got the feeling that me, like others, want everyone to hate Keane. This is not so; as I said before, there is potential here and 3 amazing tracks. However, to respond to your question ""what constitutes soul?"" there is not way to define that with words (there is, but it'd be too long).Instead, I beg you to download The Shins' ""Chutes Too Narrow"" or Flaming Lips' ""Yoshimi Battles..."". Here you will find pop's immediacy, hooks, universal lyrics, and great singing. All the components Keane supposedly has. There I hope you find ""soul""; not in order to never listen to Keane again, but just so that you can get my point.PD. The attacks to people who didn't like this cd were unnecessary. Some may be snobs, but some others (like myself) didn't like Hopes and Fears, plain and simple. The idea of this is for possible buyers to read both sides of a coin."
2,Stop the comparisons,"It is such an injustice to put a snippet of a Rolling Stone ragazine review comparing Keane to Radiohead. How out of touch can Rolling Stone be? Keane is a pleasant-sounding band, one which knows how to craft a lush pop song. They are NOT a rock band. Radiohead is a rock band. If comparisons are so important to people, try last decade's Air Supply if you want to know another band Keane may sound like."
2,Of piano-driven pop...,"If you enjoy fine piano playing, poignant lyrics, sophisticated melodies and a chilling, soaring voice, try Rufus Wainwright instead."
2,Fair enough,"I first heard these guys when I was in SF with my bad homies kicking it old skool and checking out the Messy Marv album. Anyway, I was reading ""Murder Dog"" and looking at my arms, which were pretty big, when I heard this cd blasting out of a radio that a midget was holding. I rolled up and was like ""What up midge, cuz I'm just out for the cash."" The dude looked at me like I was from a movie so I was like ""Wait for a sec, I'll be right back."" I returned and the midget ganked my Dog magazine and cut out. I was back with the bro's and then I ordered a piece of bread. Yeah, sometimes I like to have some cheese."
2,"Same girl who said:""the most stupid and sensetive band on...","Keane so so SO totally does not rock. To those who are sayingKeane rocks, what is WRONG with........? Everyone in the bandare silly, dumb, indi stars. If you're indi, then you always look ugly and dirty (unless you rock like Madonna or Franz Ferdinand ) and you sometimes smell a lot after you've been on stage. You can't rock if you're a SERIOUS indi star."
5,ahead of the pack,"It bugs me how unwilling people are to embrace Keane debute as an alltime reference rather than try and cue them second in line. Where Keane sure don't fit -- for they are number one in everything associated with CORRECT pop idiom. In ""Everybody's Changing"" Keane champion Elton John's thick voicing and orderly key-poking - to say nothing about melody scaling. The album's weakest number (as often with singles), this one nevertheless stands as parallel world to the likes of Coldplay and all in the currently defeatist and Britpop-styled mainstream pop. On the spot I can't think of a worthy contender in the same vein, though it sure is stacked on a shopshelf somewhere."
3,not my type of music,"i dont like it! why? okay, no guitar its one of my favorite intruments and without it its just dull. If i want to hear it for the piano i rather listen to Elton John.the only song i like is sunshine. the lyrics for the songs are not olot . just boring."
1,not many good songs,"I love the floating melodies so much...but in a way, hearing it on every song gets old quick. Also - the melodies on most of the tracks I was disapointed with. The best track is Somewhere Only We Know - because even though you know where it's going with the melody, the build to the choris totaly builds up drama - and it's beautiful.I don't see the comparision to Coldplay and Travis. Frankly, I think those bands are way better lyricaly and in the araingment of their tracks. Whereas, I prefer the vocalist of Keane because of the passion that's clear in the first track."
4,Lighten up and enjoy this disc,"I'm a bit at a loss, Rolling Stone mentions Coldplay and Radiohead in their review and everyone gets uptight. This disc is simply pop music, it's different because the entire disc has no guitars, it's similar to some of Coldplay's songs because it's piano driven. I don't think Keane set out to reinvent the wheel, they simply made a pop record without guitars. If you want to unwind and listen to some hook-filled music, indulge, if not, don't buy it. As far as it being rubbish, you can find that on your radio, where you won't find Keane."
5,Dynamite Debut!,"Great debut CD from this interesting band...great music and lyrics, reminiscent of moody Euro bands of the Eighties, but smarter and more sophisticated. They manage to appeal to popular music listeners while maintaining lots of originality."
5,Learn to stop being a robot!,"He explains how most people are caught in what he calls ""consensus trance"", or ruled by mechanical patterns of thought and behavior that amount to a great injustice to ourselves. Among other things, he goes over the different types of defense mechanisms we like to use, described in a way that makes them familiar. I've done just about all of them, and quite often.Unlike other authors, he's interested not only in pointing out the problem but also in what can be practically done about it, which the second half of this book is about. This is now one of my few favorite books."
3,Song Listings Please...,"Don't know if it is good/bad/other, I was browsing and didn't see a song listing so I gave it a 'neutral' 3 star because I cannot tell it N/A as I don't have.Song ListngsAcoustic RockSeries: Instructional/Guitar/DVDHL #00320429Song List:Before You Accuse Me (Take A Look At Yourself)Crazy On YouDriveDust In The WindIrisMore Than WordsNorwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)Silent Lucidity"
4,Well worth the money!,"I bought this book based on other reviews that rated it so favorably. Initially, I balked at the price and admit that the price is the major reason why I gave it 4 stars, not 5. The price is absolutely ridiculous. However, if you are willing to pay the price of what this book costs, it is well worth your money. The questions really helped me on my exams for my undergraduate microbiology course and helped to reinforce the major concepts. I used this book with Schaum's Outline of Microbiology and I received an A in my course."
4,"Great Product, except for the bands","So far so good, the P90X workout is intense and not for the faint of heart! However within tis package, the strength bands do not work well or at all! I have attempted to use all 3 that came in the package, and each time they have slipped out of the handles whacking me in the leg and almost the face. I will be contacting the seller to see if I can return these items. Outside of that I love the workouts and everything else that has come with it!"
2,"Scratchy sheet set, even toddler complains about roughness","I've made the mistake of buying ""100% soft cotton percale"" (210 thread count says OK site) sheets, including two sets from Olive Kids. My son loved the patterns, but despite my washing them with fabric softener and dryer softener sheets, he still complains ""these sheets are scrtachy and hurt me"". Maybe its the printing. They've been washed about 5 times now and I've taken to using a white jersey pillowcase to protect his face. I hope OK upgrades their thread count, but from now on, I'm NEVER buying percale. My son is three and doesn't normally complain about fabric."
4,Olive Kids Sheet Set,This is an all cotton sheet set of nice quality for kids. The only problem is they sewed the cute top edge of it to the bottom of the sheet instead of the top. The vehicles all face one way so the sheet is on upside down to make the cute border show. Bummer. The comforters (I got one twin and one full/queen) are really nice. The shams are nice and the coordinating pillow is very nice. The wall stickies don't stick. They are all falling down already. Cute products but they need a little better quality control system.
1,"Low Quality, not worth the money","I recently purchased this sheet set and the matching comforter. Both are lousy. The material is cheap and scratchy against the skin. I've paid half the price for different sheets that are much more soft. I would not recommend buying this product. In addition, the colors fade dramatically. I washed them on the delicate cycle while using a very mild detergent, and the colors still faded quite a bit. This is a waste of money."
3,Adorable but too rough,"This set is really cute.I was a little confused by the way the hem was sewn, but looking at the picture, I see that it is made that way so when you make up the bed, the pattern faces the right way.My only beef with these sheets is that they are too rough. I slept on them one night when my son wasn't feeling well and I was not comfortable at all. Granted, my husband and I have very high quality sheets on our bed. I just think, for the price, these sheets should be softer. Maybe they will soften up over time."
2,Cute but...,"My son enjoys these sheets. They are super cute, but they are not the best quality. The elastic on the fitted sheet let go after 4 washings. Hard to keep on the mattress now without elastics...."
4,Great Set,"Very pleased with the quality of the comforter, warm and snuggly yet not suffocating for a toddler. The sheets are great and soft. I was very pleased when I received my shipment before the estimated ship date."
3,Not as pictured.,"This sheet set did not arrive as pictured. There is a red ribbon trim along the edge, but no plaid fabric trim."
1,The Borg Cube causes Less Damage,"Before buying this, I'd sincerely suggest you load the U-Haul with all your possessions, retain a divorce attorney and notify your next of kin outside the relationship. This thing would be more appropriately named the WAR CUBE. I'm not saying that this thing is enough to end a relationship, but if shaky ground is a concern than say hello to the EARTHQUAKE! I can see two useful purposes for this thing. First, if you're a marriage counselor who want to turn a 6 month squabble amoung your patients into a source of income for the next 10 years. Second, if you are pining after someone with a shaky marriage and you ""helpfully"" provide this hand grenade in a see-through box. GOOD LUCK & BEWARE!Oh yeah, and the 5 on durability is for the very impressive and strong box. As my girlfriend-at-the-time pointed out, it can easily be used as a weapon. Again, BEWARE!"
4,good stuff,"I love both ""Jean"" and ""Good Morning, Starshine"" and they were the reason I bought the CD. Unfortunately, most of the other tracks are only OK and not special. I think Oliver was an amazing talent and am saddened by his early demise. I do have to wonder why he didn't record more of Rod McKuen's material, however. (Rod wrote ""Jean"".)"
1,It's crippled and it creeks,"A total waste of cinema, time and space. No offense to the disabled, but this flick is truly crippled...and it wreaks with amateur b.s. I'm so happy I only paid 29 cents for it (used). Even at that price it was rip-off. AVOID...look at the credits and avoid everyone that dared put their names to this."
4,Really great sound and it's in an aluminum case,"I stumbled across this product at RadioShack. It is manufactured from aluminum to make it durable - way better than the low end plastic cased junk I've seen around. The speakers slide back into the triangular center tube for protection.It will amplify music from i-pods, portable CD players, MP3, and satellite radio. However, it's not truly portable since it needs a 15 volt transformer to power it, and it does not have a battery compartment and that's why I didn't give it 5 stars.I needed it for a special outdoor project, so I had the guys at RadioShack test it with a 12 volt transformer and it worked really well! It's just not super loud at 12 volts.Hope this info helps."
5,Fantastic,"I absolutely LOVE this album. These songs are contemporary and fun to listen to but the lyrics are still meaningful. There is a great mix of rock and more traditional folk-ish songs, great harmony, and even a little rap stuck in - there is something for everyone on this album. The more I listen to this album, the more I love it! I listen to it EVERY day!!! I highly recommend this album to any christian looking for modern music with strong faith-based lyrics."
1,Only Highlights?!?,It is sad to see that NBC still has not learned their lesson. The 2008 DVD set included the COMPLETE opening ceremony. Not did NBC ruin the live broadcast but now they have ruined the disc version as well.
1,Poor Coverage from a Poor Company,"Poor coverage of the Olympics. Even with most of the ""prime time"" events being tape delayed, too much coverage was cut and never presented to us. Everyone should make a statement to NBC, expressing their rage over the way the olympics was covered. Too bad they have all of the coverage rights.I hope the British commemorative collection release is zone free."
1,A waste of money,This is a total waste of money.I ordered it because my wife loves the olympics and was unable to watch them when they were on. The main thing she wanted to see was the opening and closing ceremonies which one would expect to be among the highlights of the olympics.Instead i got two discs of poorly organized shovel ware.The highlights is just a long behind the scenes look at the olympics - I was so angry I couldn't finish.I want my money back and I still want a blu ray of the opening and closing ceremonies.
2,limited use OK,"I received this player last Christmas and it has served its purpose, EXCEPT the little batery covery is flimsy and cheap, breaking and no longer staying on without tape. It not on snugly, the player will not work. So, I usggest getting a player that is more sturdy for kids, or if you are going to be using it daily as I use mine."
2,Not the Zane Grey story,"This movie is NOT based on Zane Grey's novel ""Under The Tonto Rim"", formerly known as ""The Bee Keeper."" The leading lady is Lucy in both the book and the DVD, but that is where the similarity ends. In the DVD Lucy is the villain's sister and the hero owns a stagecoach line. Edd Denmeade in the book is the beekeeper, a backwoods giant of a man who is Lucy's protector and champion.I was very disappointed in this movie. As a story, it is okay, but it is NOT ""Under the Tonto Rim"". It's only fair to alert Zane Grey fans that this is not his story."
5,The best vegetarian cookbook,Sundays at Moosewood is the cookbook that convinced us that eating vegetarian can be delicious and does not have to be boring. We like to entertain and can always find great recipes for dinner parties and special occasions. Try Dolma and try the Orange and Mushroom Salad (we add avocados).
5,Stands the test of time,We are on our second copy of this great cookbook and have given copies to friends. We first bought it 18 years ago and still turn to it to make something special.
5,Best Book I've Read In A Long Time!,"This book was absolutely wonderful. At first I was worried because most of the time when I read a French book in translation, it seems lacking. This one definately was NOT lacking! David Coward did an excellent job of translating the book. The characters were definately believable, from the tragic Marguerite and Armand, to Monsieur Duval and Prudence. This book will capture anyone's imagination. I read this book in under 2 hours, I could not but it down. The story is exceptionally well crafted and what really makes it interesting was that it was based on a true story with Alexandre Dumas, fils, and Marie Duplessis, a popular courtesan in Paris at the time. This book is a must-read for anyone who loves romance and anyone who is interested in the events of France's past."
4,a classic,"La Dame Aux Camielias is a book that reaches into your heart and wraps a blanket around it. You learn a lot about the characters and you can't help but to imagine the story and the romance in your head. Although the first few pages may be difficult to overcome, the rest makes up for it."
4,AWESOME MOVIE,This movie was great. Rent it and give it a chance and I know you won't be disappointed. I've loved this film from the day it first came out. I must have seen it over 30 times and I love it more and more each time.
2,Odd Movie,"I really didn't care for this movie. I am a huge fan of John Candy (and Tom Hanks), but some of the movies he made were not very good. I made the mistake of getting this one mixed up with another one he made that I enjoyed so much more. Tom Hanks portrayed a spoiled rich guy in this one and was not very convincing at it. I found it really hard to watch it all of the way through it. I wouldn't recommend it."
3,Inaccurate Description,"As other reviews have pointed out, this set only contains one deck and no dice despite the description. Also, the items are not held in place very well and can shift around if you shake the case. The case itself appears to be well made and sturdy. The chips are plastic and durable, but the printed design is smudged on a large percentage of them. Additionally, the cards are pretty cheap and low quality. I ended up replacing them with Bicycle cards.Overall, it's not bad given the price, but if you want a quality product (especially one that actually gives you what it claims to give) you should go with something else."
1,Missing Parts,"I have to agree with most everyone here on this page...I too recieved my kit today and I too only had one deck of cards when they advertise two decks of playing cards. In the illustration, they even show set of dice, but it's not spelled out in the ad. How can they advertise something like this with so MANY dissatisfied customers!!!!"
2,"1 deck, no dice","the quality of the case and the chips is really good. however, i was disappointed that there was only 1 deck of cards and no dice in the set. also, there was only 1 dealer chip, not 3 as the photo would lead you to believe. since i had bought this to be a gift, i replaced the cheap deck with 2 decks of bicycle cards and also added a pack of 5 dice. skip this product and pay a little more for a more complete kit or at least one that you know what you're getting."
1,"Beautiful, but flawed","I recently purchased the 4 piece patio set and thought this would be a wonderful addition to add. Wrong. While the shelf itself is beautiful, it has yet to arrive intact. I ordered two and the first one that arrived was flawed, as was its replacement. The second one was also flawed, more so than the other two. I would have loved to have one, but it looks like it is just a defective product."
3,Good basics but outdated,"I learned a lot from this book when I was learning goaltending in middle school, however the position has changed a lot in the last decade+. New equipment materials, designs, and rules have made ""stand up"" goaltending obsolete and has transformed the ""butterfly"" into the ""pro-fly"" technique, which had not yet emerged at the time of this book, but is now the standard technique. That said, the book still has value in teaching the very basics to young goalies, but as always one week at a hockey camp will teach 10x more than any book."
1,Rancher 55 is a dud,"After owning for three years and having replaced the handle assy/fuel tank assy twice for leaking fuel at the seam AND now leaking again I am disappoited with the design of this saw. We heat with wood only and I cut and split lots of wood... 9-12 cord a year, once the leak gets bad enough it seems to lose the ability to get fuel mixture to carb and it won't even start and run forcing you to buy a new handle assy (which seconds as the fuel tank) for $124.00 or more. This is an enginerring/design defect that Husky refuses to help with. Their rapid response web site took nine days to respond and refused assistance of any kind. Beware, next saw will not be a Husky."
2,A great book if you are 14.,"There should be an age warning on this book: ""Not for mature audiences."" It is part of the Lensman series, probably the first extended space operas. I thought it was wonderful when I first read it, and would have given it five stars. However, I was about 13 at the time, Amazon didn't exist, and people were saying that there would never be a need for computers in the home. Most adult readers will find the prose, and particularly the dialogue, painful to read. The characters are less developed than in contemporary comic books. Still, if you know a young teenager who likes science fiction, you could make him happy by giving him this book. I'm not so sure that would work if the teenager is a girl; this series..., very much relects the prejudices and stereotypes of the times in which they were written."
1,Very poor quality!,This product was faulty from the start. The electronic scoring device does not work when used. It does work if each ball is hand placed in the hole but not when launched from the shooter.
3,"It works, but is not practical","It's fun to have and show off to your friends.But if you're going to actually be tuning an instrument, use a real tuner.I have used it to tune a few times, and the notes came up flat compared to other tuners.The keychain is durable.The back of the tuner is plastic, so if anything breaks it'll be the plastic that carries the batteries and the electronics inside.It's nice to have for a musician, but for the price, you might end up regretting it and it'll be dead money."
2,Cord is too short!,"Purchased product to use with an LG8600 cell phone, because it has a 2.5 plug. Sounded good. I then attempted to drop phone in my pocket and found the cord pulled tight on my ear! It is too short to reach bottom of pocket! This defeats my primary intended use to carry the phone to use as mp3 when working, mowing, etc. Returned immediately."
3,Body Glove Headset,"The headset did not hold up as well as expected. The plastic doesn't hold to how I contour it. It moves back to its original angles which wasn't the case with the original pair that I bought from radio shack. However, the music is clear and plenty loud. The ear inserts hold pretty well you just have to find the one that fits your ear canal the best."
2,wire is too short --> broke after about a month,"Sound quality and fit were good for the first couple weeks. Unfortunately, the cord was way too short, which is a problem I haven't had with other headsets. I keep my phone in my pockets, and the cord wasn't long enough for me to wear the headphones and keep the phone in my pocket. It was a bit uncomfortable sometimes when the earpieces were pulled by the strained cord. After about a month the left earpiece went dead, I'm guessing because of the strain on the cord. If the cord were like 6"" longer, I'd give this thing 5 stars."
1,Not too good to be bought.,I played this game over at my freind's house & it was hard.i disliked this game because it was hard!
4,"Cute, quick read","Loved the concept of two books in one. This one is definitely a quick read. Fun and punchy and uniquely different. Divas Don't Fake It was the better story of the two with an exciting, feisty heroine in Xandra. The Princess was a bit hard to relate to, but the story idea was fun. All in all, an easy two commuter train rides read."
3,"5 stars to the Diva, 1 star to the Princess","I loved reading ""Divas don't fake it"". It was really cute. Too bad the publishers had to tell the author her book would be pushed over by a stupid fairy tale. While Xandra was a sassy, ""gimme the r-e-s-p-e-c-t"", fun, outgoing, outspoken diva who wouldn't nudge, she nudged for once, and let Jacqueline the dumb, amsuing clown ""princess"" take the other half of what could have been more of Xandra's amusing and funny tale."
2,Did not find CD with this book,"I infact chose to buy this book because it included a CD of forms and templates. When I received the book, CD was missing. It was quite disappointing for me. If I were in US, I could have immediately returned the book. Because I am in a country from where the shipping cost to return the book is almost of the price of the book, I am unwillingly keeping it. When you order a book at Amazon, you expect complete delivery. Unfortunately, it has not proved this time with the delivery of this book to me."
1,Two broken units in less than 1 1/2 years & poor customer service,"I, too, had problems with ViewSonic's customer service. First unit purchased in 10/05 and broke (it just wouldn't light up) in 7/06. I sent the unit back to ViewSonic who told me I would hear from them within 10 business days. One month later and no word from the company. I called and they couldn't find my monitor, but agreed they had received it! They sent me a new unit (new to me anyway) in late 8/06. Now it is 1/07 and the new unit is going dimmer by the day. Can't return as the replacement unit's warranty is only 90 days! Thank goodness my husband works with computers and has a ready supply of monitors that I can borrow in a pinch."
4,tight but good peice of equipment,"Although i have just received this pouch, i'm sure over time it will give a little. Tight fit, but still offers access to buttons on face of garmin map 76CS"
3,For zombie completists only,"Before zombies were known to be flesh-eaters, the were more commonly associated with voodoo. In this classic pulp schlocker from l979, slow-moving ""voodoo"" zombies attack a crew with machetes. Hugh Cave throws in an offbeat political sub-plot which seems weird even in this underground yarn. For die-hard zombie completists only!"
2,Meh,"I am no professional philosopher of any kind but I am an amateur study. I think they did a good job in this book of explaining nihilistic philosophies in ways but the whole refutation is simply a baseless assertion in belief to ""imagine"" one's self out of the valid issues that nihilistic philosophers bring up. The authors bring up the UTILITY of comfort that the belief in Christ and absolute value through God, but they do not really establish the solidity of such a thing. It is a placeholder, a fragile bridge over the chasm of meaninglessness that could never span the full breadth of reality. But the utility of it is indeed there nontheless. The effect of believing in God is the effect of believing in God, not the effect of God.Ultimately only useful to people who still have Christian faith. I wouldn't recommend it otherwise."
5,The finest introduction to Western American art.,"Dr. Gray Sweeney, professor of art history at Arizona State University, is a widely acclaimed expert on 19th and 20th century American art. ""Masterpieces of American Art"" is probably his best-known work, and is a fascinating, enlightening and engrossing introduction to the subject. With numerous large reproductions of the paintings and well-written essays on the historical, artistic and biographical contexts of the works and their creators, this book is a worthwhile addition to any library."
5,The Bourne Tripleplay!,"This is great! The locations alone just added ""I want more"",to the films! It all made sense because of the world situation today. It is a subjuect that is beleiveable. The action,the plot,all make it one of the most enjoyable series of dvd's I have had the pleasure of watching in a long time! Buy it! You cannot go wrong!"
5,SUPER GOOD TRILOGY,"VERY GOOD MOVIE, WITH ACTION FROM START TO FINISH. I CAN'T HARDLY WAIT FOR THE NEXT BOURNE MOVIE."
1,Product misinformation,"The product information indicated that all three discs would play on BOTH regular DVD and HD. In fact, only one of the discs had the movie on both sides. The other two only had HD compatible.After e-mailing Amazon for a replacement, I was informed the product was not available anymore. They did indicate I could return the product for a full refund.I am quite annoyed by this purchase and will hesitate before buying anything more from Amazon."
2,The Ultimate Bourne Collection,"The price was excellent but I could not play the DVDs on my DVD players because they were ""out of region."""
5,Amzing films,All three of these films are amazing. Fans of Matt Damon must buy this DVD. The only other recommendation is also to buy the books which are even greater that the movies
5,Awesome,Really like this blu-ray because the picture quality and sound clearly surpass the dvd's. I definitely recommended this set to anyone who is a fan of the Bourne series
5,Hoping for Bourne 4,"Really loved every movie in the trilogy.Great action,writing and story line.Matt Damon delivers a solid performance,really makes the character likable and in the end hoping he finds his true identity.I'm hoping for another movie but at the same time almost afraid that if they get the wrong director or writer they could screw up this wonderful franchise"
2,Foreign movies,Foreign copy of these movies that does not play in all bluray players that makes these movies useless for some.
5,Great trilogy. More Bourne please!,"I really like the Bourne trilogy. I have watched it many times and don't tire of it so finally decided to get it. The blue-ray menu navigation is well done and shows that careful thought was put into it.As for the packaging, I was not hung up about it. I ordered the slim packaging and got the large box packaging with each individual movie separately packaged."
5,BOURNE,This is something my 23 year old son asked for. I was pleased with the price and was able to pre-order it. Thanks.
3,Not Exactly What I Expected,"All three titles were received but were not packaged as a set as had been advertized. They were just three single DVDs. As I gave them as a gift, I expected they would be boxed as a set and were not. No harm done but not exactly what I had expected."
5,Bourne Trilogy Blu-Ray,"I've been waiting for Universal to release these 3 films ever since HD-DVD went bye bye. Alas, I was not disappointed, although I was fearful that Universal would pull the same stunt they did with the regular DVD versions of The Bourne Supremacy and The Bourne Ultimatum in which they omitted the DTS soundtracks (The Bourne Identity had both Dolby 5.1 and DTS). But the studio did not disappoint, and all 3 discs have DTS -- PLUS -- amazingly improved video transfers when compared to the original DVD versions. These movies look fabulous, even on my 1080i plasma set. I can just imagine their clarity on a 1080p monitor. If you liked these movies in the theater, BUY this set. Well worth the money."
1,Beware - playback problem with first disc,"These are great movies, but the Bourne Identity disc freezes in my Sony player. The other two discs play fine."
5,wow,I have seen all of fhese movies before and I was still blown away. These movies are the perfect addition to a home theater. Ass kicking at its finest.
4,this pack is just enough,"I am happy with this set as opposed to the crazy collectors edition.Its small, well put together and all 3 great movies."
5,Bourne!,"I love few things more than than the Jason Bourne movies. I know they might not be the best spy movies ever, but the trilogy really holds up over time and I'm really glad I picked up this set before it was sold out. I still occasionally use my HD DVD drive and often times it's to pop one of the Bourne movies in to watch. If you haven't seen these movies do yourself a favor and watch them!"
2,Poor camera work spoils these otherwise interesting chase/thriller,"Bourne Supremacy: This is the one all the critics panned because of the ""shaky camera syndrome"" of director Greengrass. The effort to make the audience uncomfortable during the more exciting sequences fails miserably, I'm not the only critic to say so. If ""Identity"" director Liman had stayed in charge, the production values might have been retained. (There is even a parody of the ""shaky camera syndrome"" in ""Ocean's Twelve"" when Damon comes on screen.) Likewise unfortunate was Greengrass' camera work in ""Ultimatum"" ... but the shaky work is minimized to the actual action sequences."
1,Deceptive,"I bought this trilogy thinking i would be able to play all 3 DVD's on my DVD player. But only the last movie Bourne Ultimatum is DVD compatible the other two are HD DVD only. I will be returning this item because I am not ready to invest in a HD TV or DVD player, yet.The caption and descirption are deceptive so beware."
5,Just Awesome,"I love the extras all 3 movies are awesome in Hi- DEF would recommend it to anyone, Matt Damon at his best!"
2,Doesn't include widescreen,Great movies but for a fancy box set should include both wide screen and full screen. Full screen is pretty weak at this point i wouldn't have bought it if i knew it was full screen.
3,"Exciting, but it got a little redundant.","And I won't spoil the ""Big Mystery"", but that wasn't all that original, either.Still, entertaining if you're not looking for something particularly cerebral."
4,A must have Blu-Ray.,"Jason Bourne Trilogy worthes the money you pay for. Everything is excellent in this trilogy. Scenario is smart and breatheless. PQ is sharp and pristine, AQ is awesome!! You must have of course a decent AV Receiver with good speakers/Subwoofer, as the Bass is terrific!I suggest you to purchase also,if not already done, Casino Royale with the excellent Daniel Craig."
5,Can tie or even beat Mission Impossible,The Bourne Trilogy on blu-ray is amazing! I kept hearing about the Bourne series for a while and wanted to see for my self if it was as good as I was told. It was better! If you want a action/thriller with an amazing plot this is it. I looked for a long time to decide which set I wanted to get and this one does not disappoint. Between watching the Mission Impossible trilogy or this one I definitely choose this one.
1,Better Be Sure...,"The picture shown(which is the limited edition that I wanted) is NOT what I got - I got the regular 'dark box' version - a total let down; and because it came from a third party dealer(instead of directly from Amazon) it was a too much extra work to get the order returned, refilled & reordered, mind you w/ NO guarantee I would actually get the right product the second time around. I ended up finding the CORRECT item elsewhere, and trading the wrong one for a couple of copies of CATS(B-day presents for chicks)...SO, IF You're going to buy this, try getting a hold of the dealer directly & make sure they sent the right thing...if they even actually have it - they might be lying all together..."
4,A note on the packaging,"I couldn't figure out how to open this set. I was tugging on the sides. Then I tried to slip the case off vertically. I was on the verge of forcing open the box when I decided to google the set, hoping to see something about the packaging scheme since there is no clear indication as to how to open it. Before you force this thing open, take note: The cover image of Matt Damon is a magnet. It flips open to the left, allowing access to the discs. Enjoy."
5,Exciting Trilogy!,"All 3 Bourne movies are fantastic, but even better on Blu-Ray. Would definitely recommend this set to others - it's wonderful."
4,Picture does not match.,"Item fits, but do not order based on the picture. Nut and bolt IS the kit, the part that keeps both sides from spinning when tightening(which was my reason for buying)is NOT INCLUDED. Live and learn.How this ""customizes"" your set-up I have no idea(oh well)."
3,A Devil Incarnate: From Altar Boy to Alcatraz--The Autobiography of William Radkay #666AZ,"Willie's life is very interesting although this book is chronologically haphazard. Moreover, some of his tales do not coincide with known facts. Like meeting Alvin Karpis at Hutchinson. Willie was incarcerated there in 1935 and Karpis left there in 1930. Willie also said he spent time in Missouri State Pen with Charles ""Pretty Boy"" Floyd in 1935 but Floyd was already dead then. This throws into question the factual basis of Willie's recollections."
4,Good for ages 5 and up (instructional),"This video is unstructional, but not aimed at adults. I'm guessing the target age would be 5 and up. The first fifteen minutes are just learning the ABCs. The instruction is very thorough, slow, and clear.The instructor reminds me of a kindergarden teacher. They focus on her and she talks to the kids, shows them the signs, sings a song, and reviews.After the initial 15 minutes they focus more on the ABC songs.This would be a good video for a 5 to 7 year old who already wants to learn sign. Children younger than that will most likely become bored and not watch.It's excellent for children who thrive on learning."
5,Change the World,This resource enables the one action humans can do to affect needed change in the world--prayer. Our natures make it hard to really engage in prayer but the msnusl gives practical time-tested ways of helping us focus. A forgotten strategy that has worked in USA and Japan. I couldn't rate it any higher.
5,Great book to explain to family and friends,I have a son with Autism and this book helped my family understand many of the issues that my wife and I had been trying to explain for years. I actually have ordered 4 books!
1,interested Christian,"Any book that purports to represent the historical Jesus and yet claims He has an earthly father and that His miracles were some form of medicine is pretty much more of a fairy tale rather than a true story of Jesus. I think the author was trying to steal the real Jesus from people by pretending this great knowledge.Historically, it is impossible to have proof either way that Jesus was born of God or not, Having witnessed many genuine miracles Jesus has done in this day, I feel sorry for the guy who thinks Jesus Christ is a phony. There is a heaven to gain and a hell to shun.Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and get saved!The recent discovery of the burial box of James, brother of Jesus is archeological proof that Jesus, the man, existed. It's up to each one whether to accept him as God or not. I was disappointed that this promising book did not back up Jesus as God."
4,tangled history,"The tangled and often bloody history of eastern Europe is updated to include events after the end of the Cold War. Rothschild writes of the conflicting influences that drove events. Like the myriad nationalisms (Czech, Slovak, Hungarian, Serb, Croat...) that were often suppressed under the Warsaw Pact. During the Cold War, these could often be neglected by analysts. Yet later, some would erupt into open tension or outright conflict. The latter being the Yugoslav Wars.The book's title alludes to this suppressed diversity of heritages and ethnicities. It also contains material about the Cold War that only became available after its end."
5,Great letter opener with a super touch of whimsy....,"When I ordered this item, I was looking for a letter opener with some weight to it and a longer blade. This one is just perfect and attractive to look at. The BIG surprise, that I probably would have learned at the time of purchase if I had read the description more closely...the faux stone crystal base lights up in a beautiful array of colors. Great visual distraction for an office admin who needs a minute break to regroup from time to time."
4,A close friend co-starred,"I like this movie because the ""Charlie"" acter was a good friend and he would tell me about his role and how the movie was progressing. And since he died several years ago, I can watch the movie and remember the friendship we had before his sudden death."
1,Evangelicals Who Believe In Calvinism!!!!!!!!!!,"Given the present theological dynamics surrounding queries into the nature of God and human destiny, it saddens me to encounter Christian thinkers who are determined (no pun intended)to retreat into the fetid bowels of a tired, stale Reformed Weltanschauung instead of bravely engaging the challenges presented to dogmatics and hermeneutics as we approach the new century. What is lacking in these essays is the belief in a personal deity who can transcend our expectations (cf. Deut. 23 and Isaiah 56) - even our expectations regarding the extent of God's saving activity - and whose mercy can defeat our most entrenched theological prognostications! Viva la grace!"
1,Terrible Quality,"We bought this for our five year and it is horrible in quality. We couldn't fit the batteries in after multiple attempts. for the record we are not morons, we have an MD and an MBA between my husband and I). After further investigation, we realized that the battery contacts in the pen were bent. I have written a complaint letter to the company. Anyone who has tried to give a child a toy and then have to deal with the aftermath of it not working, be ware, this toy is not worth it! After our experience with this malfunction, I have done some internet research and found that this is a common complaint amongst purchasers. Very disappointing!"
3,From someone looking for help with interviews.,"This book does a great job of laying out the concept for the best answers to behavior based questions. It also covers 50+ possible questions that the Interviewee may face. On the other hand, its suggested that all one has to do is prepare thoroughly. Its as if we could all be great musicians if we practiced morning, noon, and night. In the book's defense, it does give us some acronyms and other drills to help in creating our interview stories, but there are few other incites for our journey along the yellow brick road. In parting, the book starts with a test, on which upon taking I graded genius level. Believe me, when it comes to interviewing, I'm not that good. Still, this book is worth consideration."
4,"Well Written, although not a jump start book","I wrote to the author's reply email address with a question about the text, around August 05 and never received a response. It would be a better book if she took a little time in each chapter to discuss using the information in the real world before having to read several chapters to get to the hands on application of the technology she presents. This one point is why I chose not to give it a 5."
4,It's all here,"If you are just getting into digital photography or are at the intermediate stage this book is for you. It is probably the most complete book on digital photography that I have seen. It has 698 pages of valuable information that is sure to aid you in becoming a more knowledgeable and better digital phothgrapher. It begins with ""Why Digital"" and from there covers everything imaginable dealing with digital photography. If you use ""Photoshop"", you will be pleased by the amount of detail that has been given to users of this very capable program. The book does not cover everything that can be done with this wonderful program but it does provide enough detail to get you well on your way. This book was published in 2004 and is a little behind on some of it's information. For instance, it referances Photoshop 7 and CS while CS3 is just about to be released. I would still highly recommend this book. It is a little pricy but I believe it is well worth the price."
3,Class book,I only bought this because I needed it for class. It is everything it says it is now for reference
5,Imagine a world in which there is no time. Only images.,"'Einstein's Dreams' is at once delightfully simple and utterly complex. An absolutely enchanting and absorbing read from start to finish. It is philosophical poetry presented in stream-of-conscienceness, and so much more. There is no comparison...Beautiful."
4,Like no other book I've ever read,"This book was very thought-provoking. Most of the chapters explore what life and the world would be like if time operated in a certain way. For instance, in one chapter, time moves slower the higher you go. Only the rich were able to live in the highest towers because time was such a precious entity. Sprung from Einstein's theory of relativity, this book is very interesting. If you want a ""different"" read than what you are used to, or if you really like to think outside the box. I definitely recommend this book."
5,if you have not stared into the distance.....,"simply the best book i've ever read, a luccid dream like state, weaves you in and out, of these differnt worlds that are the same ones at the same time, giving you a new and differnt perspective on each... too much and too hard to put into words, it was a late birthday present from a friend, who's girlfriend had to read it for a univeristy course, he said ""this book is all about being punk"" every time i read it i get closer to undersatnding what Joe meant by that. it sets you down in a grey almost sad, still place, that you come to realize is the way we live our lives every day....."
5,An excellent book!,"This novel had fluid prose and with very simple language, was able to portray incredibly profound ideas. It did not have much of a plot, as other reviewers have mentioned, but that did not prevent it from getting its point across. Just as a more plot-filled novel keeps the reader reading because she wants to see what happens next, this book enthralled me to keep reading because I wanted to find out what Einstein's other ideas about time were. And even though it contains little plot, the book is clearly connected, more so than a book of even the most similar poems. I loved it, and it's a must-read."
5,Masterpiece of both fiction and the sciences,The way in which this marvelous book was written enables the reader to interpret its passages on many different levels. It is the kind of book you can read again and again and still find a new insight into life and its meaning. I will not say anything else other than - you must read it and see for yourself!
4,"A provocative, readable study of the 4th dimension-time","It was a delightful view of Einstein's development of his ideas concerning time-the 4th dimension. Taking a personal style during Einstein's tenure as a patent clerk in switzerland, Lightman humanizes the various effects of changing the limits of time in relation to the speed of light. He uses analogous human situations-Einsteins life and life in Switzerland at that time -to bring us the variations of the "" time"" theory. A very romantic but incisive look at the overall affect of ""time"""
5,Calling All Dreamers,"Amazing little book. Makes you think a lot, yet isn't a hard read at all. Can only read a few stories in a sitting, otherwise you don't get to absorb each story very well. Again great book, a must read."
3,Amusing but slight.,"If you're familiar with Steven Millhauser, Lightman's writing style doesn't have any surprises in it. Although Lightman's book is enjoyable, it lacks the resonance and depth that Millhauser's work has. The thoughts on time meander and leisurely move along in prose-poem fashion. However, the thoughts merely skim the surface and Lightman doesn't seem interested in delving more deeply into his material. The overall effect is amusing, but slight, much like this review."
4,a journey straight into dreamtime..,After reading each segment of the novel I felt as if I was emerging from a deep daydream. It's a complete escapism and brings the mind of the genius into a form anyone can relate to.
5,Love this book!,Full of little vignettes that offer little insights about the ways in which time could exist. Each of these vignettes are dated and very interesting ways of thinking about time. Highly recommended for anyone!
4,A Study in Human Nature as Well as Physics,"Alan Lightman writes as if he is monotonously droning on quietly to himself, and this method works. His images are so sublte, despite their definition, that I was not struck by the bizarre worlds he created until I had taken ""Einstein's Dreams"" in as a whole. However, reading this book on the surface as a collection of Einstein's hypothetical dreams while he came up with Relativity might leave you bored and disappointed. Lightman goes deeper than that, using each scenerio to not only exagerate different aspects of physical time, but also to shine light on disturbing aspects of human behavior. We see people who live only for the present, or who's lives are entirely predestined, and how they react to the situation. There is some truth in all Lightman's surreal vignettes.""Einstein's Dreams"" is rather short and does not take long to read, so I recommend giving it a try if you have nothing to do one afternoon. You might be pleasantly surprised."
2,Glad it's short or i'ld have never finished,"The first three chapters of the book are interesting - after that point it becomes clear that the reader is going to be reading nothing more than variations on the theme. I found myself increasingly uninterested as the author led me by the nose along a path of discovery which i could have more creativly and accuratly discovered on my own. The authors descriptions of worlds in which time operates different from our own insult the genius of Einstein by inffering that the words in this book are the subconscious workings of the great physicists mind. My thoughts were far deeper - I can only expect his were as well. It would be more accuratly titled ""Lightman's Dreams"""
1,Indoctrination into the New Age,"The book is a poetic and lyrical work which lulls the reader into a semi-hypnotic state of suggestability after which the author slips in a bit of humanistic, new-age philosophy which the non-critical reader is then likely to swallow whole.Overall there is nothing new in the book. The philosophy can be traced back to the Theosophical Society, Freemasonry and the other roots of the current New Age fad. Einstein and his work have nothing to do with the book but seem to be merely intellectual bait to draw in the curious."
3,Predictable story line,Gave it 3 stars because the actors tried hard with the story they were given and the predictable conclusion. The end.
5,The Best Beck Book,"This is the best book on Jeff Beck. Annette Carson is a most excellent writer, and she brings us down to the music. No sex, no drugs. It's about the guitar.This book is a very good read and a must for any fan of the greatest guitarist ever: Jeff Beck. You have to read it a few times to be able to absorb all the info! The pictures included are also a very nice touch. If you read nothing else this year, or on Jeff Beck, read this."
4,A decent career review through the 90's,"""Crazy Fingers"" is a no-frills kind of biography. Focusing mostly on Jeff's career and gear, as opposed to an obsessive character study, the author gives a nice overview of the artist and his work. If you are a long time fan of Mr. Beck, there is probably not a ton of new material here regarding his playing, although some of Carlson's speculative narrative is interesting regarding Jeff's career choices. The best aspect of this book is the detailed discography included at the end and a very enlightening documentation of Jeff's guest appearances on various sessions throughout. Be that as it may, it is the best text that I know of about one of the true giants of electric guitar."
4,Jeff Beck,"If you are a true Beck fan then this is for you. Not many ugly tales from back in the day. The book contains mostly historical and factual stuff, including personal quotes and detailed info about his equipment."
2,"Ok, but drying","I have used this for about a month now. I have fine color-treated curls. I found the product to be ok at first, but it has dried my hair out more than I would have expected. It does make for nicely defined curls until the product dries and you touch your hair. Dry and frizzy is the result of touching. I was looking for something which would define my curls and not dry the out. This is not the product."
4,Wonderful Read,"I bought this book a few months ago, but finally took the time to read it yesterday. This woman is on to something. The insights she gives to those of us who grew up without fathers, and thought it was perfectly normal--only to find out in the real world, we were limping along in life-are life changing. My dad died when I was 11 months old. When I would ask about him, I got no answers. Combine that with a bitter and scared mother and you have a chronic overachiever who has lost touch with the true spirit of femininity. This is the kind of stuff that breeds mistrust between us and men, and competition amongst women. Ladies, we must commit ourselves to healing. God is the only true healer, and he's been telling us through his word, that this kind of hurt can be healed."
4,A Must Read,"I found this book while preparing a Father's Day sermon. Ms.Barras'story, which was open,honest,and informative with eye-opening statistics,kept me captive long after I retreived the information I was looking for. As a father of two young women, it helped me see the importance of always being there for them. It addresses a real issue in the Black community that both black women and men could befefit from."
5,Pretty Girls Make Graves,"This is the best band i have ever heard.... When I first heard of them I thought that they would [be bad] because most punk bands don't have girls in them. But, after I listened to just one song I totally fell in love with them! They are so gifted! I command you to buy this cd haha...-Josie ;D"
5,table,"This is a good item, good quality, fast shipping, well priced... Used for camping and then set up at Christmas for bar table."
3,Tasty but messy,"My son loves these and I like them because they are organic, but they break apart easily and when I turn around, my son is a sticky mess! Not the type of snack you give a toddler in the car or stroller."
3,Bad Cuz,We have had a Bad Cuz for eight years and it has been a durable toy. The new one was shredded on the first day!
4,Best toy I've found!,"I have a young male Lab that is a power chewer! He can chew ANYTHING. I went to the pet store and asked for their most durable dog toy and he broke it in a few days. Then I found the Cuz at a local horse supply store. He loves the squeaker, which still hasn't broken after a month. The medium is perfect for his mouth size. He is able to squeak it himself. The squeaker is also very loud, which he loves and I really don't!The only down side to this toy is that he chewed the feet off. The toy still works so it's not the end of the world. If your dog is anything like mine, expect the feet to be detached."
1,20 minute toy,"I bought this for my 2 yr, old Yorkie - he loves squeaker toys but the toys do not last very long and this ball was no exception.Though it seemed to be well built my Yorkie chewed out the squeaker in less than 20 minutes and destroyed the ball in another 30 minutes. The feet were the first to go. The ball appears to be rubber and the squeaker is hard plastic. He literally chewed the ball apart - small rubber chunks everywhere. The squeaker is large enough for you to retrieve once you no longer hear it squeak, but you have to be on top of the chew progress.This item is definitely not designed for dogs that love to chew.So I am still looking for the ultimate squeaking chew toy for him."
4,One of her favorites toys!,We know that anything w/a squeaky quickly is silenced and quickly disguarded. However Cuz is a toy that quickly has become her favorite and she can't wait for me to get home from work to play fetch. She also is a chewer so she likes the hole SHE created and she chews on it most of the day. You would think this was the only toy she has. I'm happy when she's happy though.
3,Good but.....,"Good product, although the first thing my dog did was to chew the feet off! Otherwise OK. The squeaker is not REALLY anoiying either, if you are sensitive to the sound."
1,Waste of Money,"I bought one this toy for my 10 pound yorkie poo and he destroyed it in less than an hour. It was only like $5 so it's not that big of a deal but ideally it would have lasted a couple days, not an hour. I would try to find something a little more durable."
2,Squeaker broke instantly,"My dogs would steal this toy from the neighbor's dog and run and play with it all day. So I bought them a large one. As I was opening it and taking the tag off of the the squeaker pulled away from the inside of the toy and broke! My dogs aren't interested in it at all (they are labs), and I don't know if it because it's too big for them or if it is because the rubber smells really bad... I'll try and wash some one the smell off. Disappointed."
2,The squeaker was its downfall,"After reading how durable this toy was, I was surprised to discover that it took my 50-pound dalmatian mix all of 90 minutes to completely destroy it. I bought 2, so I watched him work over the second one, and saw that he was able to get his teeth on the squeaking plastic device and gnaw until it came loose, after which it was only a matter of time until he had pulled the entire thing apart piece by piece.Make one of these things without the squeaker, and maybe it would survive."
3,Good tape,"I own this tape and it has proven useful. I dislike the belt clip, it's almost unusable. Most times it goes in my pouch so it's not a major gripe but when I do want to hook it on my pants or belt it becomes a nuisance.I like the area to write dimensions. Overall It's good but not great. Sometimes when grabbing the hook to pull out the tape my finger slips off, I think the hook should be a tad larger."
1,Pure fiction,"Remember the guy who found ""evidence"" that the murder of six million jews by the Nazis did not really happen? Well Sean McPhilemy seems to have attended the same school of historical fantasy. This book was utter trash of the very worst kind. Its outlook was purely sectarian - little mention of IRA murder of Protestants, let alone that the IRA is the biggest single killer of Catholics in Ireland. ""Political Assassinantion in Northern Ireland""? - only half the story, and most of that is low on truth!"
5,At the Center of the Storm,"This book is more essential reading than ever, now that author McPhilemy has thoroughly trounced his attackers at the Murdoch-owned London Sunday Times with a unanimous jury verdict in his favor, and now that he has escaped with barely a scratch from the $100 million libel suit brought against him by two Portadown car dealers. If that latter lawsuit had any serious likelihood of winning, the car dealers hardly would have accepted a settlement in which they suffered a net loss of about a million dollars, and in which McPhilemy and his publishers did not have to apologize or pay even one thin dime. This book has survived two years of sustained attacks, which leads this reviewer to the conclusion that there must be something to it."
1,terrible,"Being a police officer in the RUC in the area mentioned in the book at the time of the incidents I was horrified to read this. It beggers belief that people read this and believe it, but such is the nature of people they seek not truth but support for narrow blind opinions. If you took this out of the Northern Ireland context and wrote it about anywhere else it would by laughed out of print! The plot is pure fiction, the so called facts of the most basic policing details are shear rubbish. I went through this book writing comments and corrections to all the inaccuracy and simple mistruth I could find just from my own experience and I left not one page untouched. This book is sad and bad a dangerous deperate attempt by a discredited second rate journalist to make money on others misery. Luckily the many court cases and other investigations in process will ultimately consign it to the fiction shelf where it belongs."
3,Great little table - with one caveat...,"This IS a great table, but as one purchaser pointed out, the plastic connectors ARE plastic.I bought this table for use on my patio where it will not be disassembled and reassembled, so the fragile plastic parts won't be a problem. It's very lightweight - but feels pretty sturdy, actually.If you only use it to go camping once or twice a year, it will probably work for you. I would give it 5 stars but for the plastic connectors, but then plastic is what makes it lightweight and very portable.It also comes with a heavy duty nylon, cylindrical storage bag like those used for folding chairs."
4,Just what the title says!,A great book for those of us who occasionally need a nudge in the creativity department. Also great if you need a last minute gift and want to make something quick. Great for beginner and advanced jewelry makers alike.
4,Amazing Action,"Just believe me when I say that Dante's Awakening has everything. It has the fun, the depth, and the look. It has the reason to skip school, the reason to call in sick to work, and the reason to reconsider that Friday night date. It has five difficulty settings (all challenging, most insane), plenty of secret missions, unlockable bonuses and costumes, an easy to use interface, and more brain-twisting puzzles than the first two games combined. In other words, it's the reason you bought a PlayStation 2, now go and enjoy it."
1,Much supposition,"The writer uses a lot of ""what if's"" instead of proving his position by the Bible. I was truly disapointed!"
1,Might look good on paper,"I read the book because of several people mentioning it. His thoughts may sound correct, but there is much lacking in authority and application. He claims to be a minister for the Lord's church. However, some of the comments he makes leads me to believe the church where he ministers has fallen into apostacy. Some of the things he suggests may have some spiritual backing and some things may look good on paper, but I doubt if the application would work. As an instance, he suggests there is no need for a weekly collection. He suggests that a collection is only necessary when there is a specific need. Couple this with the suggested ""house church congregation"" and the thought that some elders should be paid for their work, one asks, when it come time to pay the elders, from where will the money come? I only hope those who read this book will continue to look for restoring the church according to the Bible."
5,Examples work,"Ellie Quigley has written an outstanding introduction to Perl, which I used to learn the language from scratch. All one has to do is work through her examples, putz around with them, and before long, you're relatively proficient at using the language. Even though I've graduated to using Programming Perl by Wall et al, I still find Quigley's book a most useful reference."
3,"Good, but examles are too simple","I use the Perl language daily (and I love it). I own several of Ellie's books and have taken classes from her in Silicon Valley. The books are clear, the index is excellent, but the examples are too simple. Many examples use input typed in from the keyboard (instead of reading in input from a file). Business applications/corporate applications usually read in input from a file."
2,Not that informative,"I recently got into 35 MM SLR photography as a hobby and was looking for a good book to start with. I was looking for a book that would take me through the basics like, exposure, aperture and shutter speed etc., and then on to the advanced topics. I bought this book going by the reputation of the author, but I was honestly, disappointed.The first few chapters in the book does a good job of explaining the basics in aperture setting, shutter speed etc. But from then on, its merely a collection of good photographs with some accompanying text, which do not delve much into the details. While I should accept that this is the first ever photography book I purchased and read, I did manage to glance through a few more and found out that this book is severely lacking in content and details.If you are looking for a good introductory book to photography which could also be used as a worthy reference, go for Bryan Peterson's ""Understanding Exposure"", definitely not this one!"
4,Thunbs up,"Good workout and you have options; arms, core , etc. each segment is 12 minutes long, plus a full body stretch."
4,This is a great purchase!,"This workout is great for someone who doesn't focus much on strength training, but would like to stay toned. It's also great for sculpting. I workout to this video at least twice per week. I love it."
2,Disappointed.,"I've been a fan of the original Model in a Bottle formula for quite some time, now, but my skin has become very sensitive over the past few months so I decided to try the sensitive skin formula. It does not work nearly as well as the original formula. However, it does work a little bit. Your makeup will stay better, using it, than it will, if you don't... I definitely recommend purchasing the original formula, whether you have sensitive skin or not. I have very sensitive, acne prone skin, and the original did not affect my skin in any way. I hope this review will help you make the right choice."
1,A disappointment,"Very disappointing -- muddy sound quality, rushed tempo, and indifferent horn playing. If you're interested in Telemann, look at recordings by other orchestras."
2,An Adult Toy,My title of this review says it all. I am an adult collector of Barbie Dolls. This one is definitely not a toy. She is beautifully dressed and coiffed. Elegant!
2,The bottle's sprayer is not as good as other sprayer brand's bottles,"When spraying poison on plants, it's important to be able to evenly cover the plants while not getting a whiff of the insecticide yourself.I have used several brands of insecticide spray, and found this bottle's sprayer to be of the lowest quality. It doesn't matter what the quality of the insecticide is if you cannot keep it out of your own face, and at the same time cover the plants evenly.I tried both the spray and the stream mode, and found neither to be as good as the spray and stream on other sprayers.I went to Home Depot and bought the Ortho Elementals, and the bottle sprayer is such higher quality! I am easily able to spray the plants, and it doesn't create a mist that blows around randomly in the wind."
1,KILLS EVERYTHING-DONT BUY--POISON,"Horrible READ LABEL --IT WILL KILL EVERYTHING AROUND YOU.This poison is NOT ""Safe"" in any way.Company REFUSES to give refund and willcharge you twice what you pay for productfor shipping. 3 days later you receive thispoison in the box surrounded by enoughpackaging so it won't break and causepeople to be killed. Don't know how thiscan be shipped in the mail.Label says it will kill you, your bugs,your family, every fish, frog, lizard in your area.You can't breathe it, get it on your hands,wash your clothes, wear a breathing apparatusor you will DIE spraying it.It will KILL your pets and kids.But if you wash it off with water it's harmless???"
3,a good one,"its average as far as pc bar games go, standard graphics and gameplay. contains pool,darts, and pinball. its well worth the price and is worth playing. if your in the market for this kind of gaming pick it up!"
3,a mixed bag...,"""Kol Nidrei"" has long been one of my favorite 'cello solos... full of gut-wrenching emotion, passion, and techincally demanding. I was disappointed with the performance on this CD. Mr. Berger's interpretation seemed to me to be rather wooden in several sections, and therefore lost quite a bit of the piece's pathos.""Cancona,"" the second piece on the CD is, in my opinion, the highlight of the recording. It has much more life and freedom of interpretation in the performance than ""Kol Nidrei"" does.The performances of the two other selections on the disc are quite average. Both the ""Adagio"" and ""Ave Maria"" are premiere recordings, and are not pieces with which I had heard prior to listening to this CD. Despite their unfamiliarity, I believe that both of them will eventually be recorded more often, and will undoubtedly have more vitality than they did in this recording."
1,The easy way to poor out the oil (after cool),"This is a must have for anyone who has trouble lifting 5 gallons of oil in a slippery cooker. The pump is the same as the ones that pump kerosene. So you can get the same thing cheap locally if you don't want to wait for shipping. Fast, self priming, easy.*** Don't try to move hot oil *** Do turn off flames ***Hot oil will quickly melt the plastic pump and the plastic will stick to the sides of the fryer and ruin your oil and machine."
4,Psychic powers save the day!,"My only complaint is that the story isn't more original because I read/watch a lot of these kinds of stories. A psychic and a fledgling psychic are recruited by a professor of the paranormal. When a local college student is murdered, the psychics get wrapped up in a murder mystery. Throw in a reporter who becomes intrigued with the paranormal and possibly the fledgling psychic... The characters are vivid and entertaining. The psycho is creepy. The writing is good and the relationships are engaging."
3,Good but not as good.,"I purhcsed the blue ball and enjoyed it for about one hour. Then when starting it with the string, it became jamed on the side of the gyro inside the ball. After I freed it, the plastic tip on the chord remained inside. Oh well, there is a tip on the other end of the string. Well that theory worked until the string became jamed once again and that time also remained jamed inside the ball. Now I have two ends trapped inside the ball that may someday jam something. Now, I'm unable to get it stated without the string. So, now I have a $40 dust collector. They need to send you extra strings to start it. However, when it did work it was great."
5,Simple tale delightfully shared,"Sharon Shinn has a true gift for story telling. This slender novella is actually my most favorite of her books, for it's simple style. She never over explains, it's just charming and romantic."
3,a tale of magic and love,The shape-changer's wife is not really his wife. This is a tale of magic and love. Aubrey has come to the shape-changer to learn the magic for shape-changing. He comes to learn the secret of shape-changing as well as how evil the shape-changer has become.
2,LOUSY EARPIECE CONNECTION DESIGN,"Havent had my headphones a year yet, and Iwould say that the LEFT EARPIECE has dislodged from the connection that goes over your head atleast a dozen times....and now it wont even snap back in place. Also it turns out that the wire to LEFT EARPIECE runs directly underneath the plastic snap connection that the plastic ball earpiece part of the connection snaps into... (well no longer snaps into. Sound quality is actually by my standards average at time of purchase and has degraded in sound quality more and more with each with each earpiece failure. Wouldnt purchase again and wouldnt of purchased originally if what I knew then what I know of the poor engineering of the earpiece connections. Also the wire splitting for the mic jack and speaker jack (as seen in above picture are not split in a distance that I found workable for my system. Be warned!"
2,Door in the Mountain,"What makes poetry, poetry. Too many of these ""poems"" are just spurts of words with no rhythm and little feeling. I was very disappointed after reading some very good reviews of her work."
3,Don't believe your Kaplan test scores.,"I think Kaplan makes its CAT cd tests much harder than real ETS tests so that people will get scared and take the Kaplan courses. I got a 570,610,560 on the Kaplan tests and didn't take the fourth one because I didn't want to get depressed. This is pretty consistent with other reviewers as well.I got a 690, 730 on the powerprep and 750 on the actual test - ie practice helped drive my scores up using the powerprep software which is free but such a pattern didn't emerge on the kaplan tests I took.Apart from not being reflective of the difficulty level, the Kaplan CD(I hardly looked at the book because the real material is on the CD that comes with the book) is reasonable.I liked ""The Insiders guide to the GMAT cat"" a lot more though and nothing beats the Official Guide as long as you make sure you do the last 50-100 questions in each math section(ie the first 100 or 200 are very easy but then they get realistic)"
3,"Nice Math Review, Poor Test Questions","After scoring a 690 on the PowerPrep, I figured I should tackle the Kaplan Book and take the practice tests. The math review is comprehensive, and quite thourough, so I was quite confident that I would score well above 690 on the first Kaplan Practice Test. To my dismay, I scored a 600. So I took another test, and this time it was a 590. After contemplating quitting my studying altogether, I checked the reviews here and felt a thousand percent better. Thank you to all the reviewers who took the time out and explain their problems, which seem to be common among many test takers. This book is great for its math review, but be forewarned, the whole review is long, so allow yourself a large chunk of time if you feel your math skills are lacking. Take the practice tests to get down timing and get a feel for how long the actual test is, but take the test results with a grain of salt."
1,"Almost a full 1/16"" off","I know every tape measure is different from the next, but this thing is nearly a full 1/16"" off when compared to three other tape measures and my table saw fence. The pencil sharpener is useful, I needed one in the shop, otherwise this thing remains untouched on the shelf."
3,Fast cap : Awesome design : Don't let it fall once !!!!!!!!!!,"I love these tapes. But if it drops one time..... From 3-4 feet off the ground. The zinc or whatever metal That holds the spring in place will shatter..And Sad I am. Trying to replace the piece with something stronger is tough. Wish they would fix these 'small' production problems. Then they would have a Classic Winner!!!I'd pay more for this item if I knew it was just a little tougher. And yes, I only use these for cabinetry. No framing, or beating up. PLEASE, fix the 5 cent piece that could make this a perfect tool."
3,Historical overview for the astonished business traveler,"The authors describe the historical developments of Dubai in a concise and fairly complete form. They clearly describe the success stories, and the pivotal people who shouldered it. However, the subtitle of the book, paired with the authors' background suggest that a true analysis will be given of what the fundamental parameters are in driving the success story. Also, they promise to make a link with Silicon Valley and Singapore. This fundamental layer of knowlege is in my opinion missing from the book, and thus it does not meet its promises. Nevertheless, what is there, makes it easy and interesting to read, and is a welcome addition to the library of the Middle East business traveler."
2,BAILEY'S CAFE needs to be renovated.,"BAILEY'S CAFE would have been better if the characters and situations had not been described to death! The people that frequently this establishment were interesting enough, but when they are described to the last atom, then it takes away from the book and it becomes lackluster. This was almost like reading a Stephen King novel, except the monster was not in the book, but in READING the book. Not my cup of tea."
1,Easyshare C633 OK???,"Just bought the C633 easyshare with the series 3 printer dock for my wife for Christmas. This camera is junk. First of all, the software kept giving me errors and had to reboot/reload software 3 times before it would function. 2nd, The camera will not take clear pics unless it is perfectly still, which i've only found can occur when placed on a table (unbelievable!). 3rd, the batteries died after 25 pictures. (these batteries came with the camera)So now, I have no good Christmas pitures, a crappy gift that has to be returned, and wait in lines to return it.Unless I have a total lemon camera,which I'll never find out unless i by another one..hmmm...I don't think so, it's junk, and i probably won't be buying another Kodak product for a while.Jon"
3,Gnot so gnu,"3 1/2Nearly as meandering as it is masterful, the shortened release gets by on intriguing, if not completely captivating interplay."
3,The cuties you need to get!,I totally love this product. It is soo cool and i would highly recomend it. This product grows so fast. The seamonkeys are soo cute. When i come home from school they make me soo happy. I just don't know what the 4th packet is for so i don't use it. I had them for 2 weeks now and i love them. They are such darlin's. I bet that if you bye this you will love this. This is also great because if for some sad reason you poor babies die than you get a two year live warentee and you get tham for free. Isn't that great. I mean really what if one of your pets die no more pet but with these the fun is just begining. you will have fun from the time you open the water purifier. I hope this was of help. thanks. Bye!
3,Careful!,"Despite the remarkable hype, any prospective buyer should be aware that the creatures in question are not monkeys or anything close to monkeys, but brine shrimp. With the proper care, the shrimp can breed and even be fed to fish."
5,my new favorite craft book...,"and that's saying a LOT! I've been looking for a book that gave me inspiration in a folk-art, found-art, outsider-art type way, and this is IT! excellent directions, great pictures, great ideas. I can't recommend this book enough, and I hope the author writes more."
5,Law & Order CI DVD Season 6,I have not been able to view this packet yet but it appears to be new as ordered.thank you very much
4,Fits my 55lb. Beabull well,The sweater is a little snug and kind of thin but keeps him warm. Be aware that it's a turtleneck when purchasing.
4,Chris Has Departed this World,"Rest In Peace, Dear brother your work is completed....Chris ""The Rock"" Jones ___March 11, 1970 - October 8, 2006"
2,Keep looking,I wish I had read the reviews here before I bought mine (not from Amazon). I chose this model b/c it is one of the smallest that will hold standard 3 gallon bottles. It is small but that is about all. It makes a noise that is louder than others I have had. I have only dispensed about a gallon but the chemical taste is far worse than my tap water! Also the reservoir must be small b/c I filled a few 16 oz glasses and it was out of cold water. The buttons are small and harder to push and hold for the extended period of time that it takes to fill a glass. Filling bottles is tricky b/c you can't see exactly where the spigot is. I am returning mine and going back to renting from the water company...
1,I just threw it away.,"Complete waste of money. Water tasted like plastic, dispenced too slowly. Hated it."
4,"Exciting topic, but long-winded","This was a frustrating book. The subject and its treatment are so delicious that I couldn't put it down, yet the endless recycling of the oxygen atom and his eventually Earth-bound buddies to the End of Time made me want to shoot it. This is truly a book that could have used a few timelines, charts and a Cast of Characters to avoid overwhelming the reader with its never-ending chemical cast."
5,He-Man rules!,"I haven't seen this movie in years. I stumbled upon it while searching other movies on Amazon. It wasn't the best film ever made but it was entertaining. Bought the movie for my oldest son who loved watching the He-man cartoons when he was just a young lad.I give it 5 Stars because, though it was never a blockbuster it was a very fun film to watch. I recommend it to anyone who had enjoyed the Masters of the Universe series on TV. Dolph was a good pick for He-man."
3,Bought it for One song,"Really just bought this for the Jimmy Lafave song on it, which I love, the rest is just ok for me."
5,weeds of the Northeast,One of the most helpful books on weeds I've ever had.I would recommended this book to anyone that needs to identify and control weeds.
1,Not worth watching,"Initially I found the movie so unengaging (is that a word?) that I stopped watching it half way through. The next day curiosity got the best of me and I watched the remainder, which was no better.I'm not sure what the problem is. The plot seems OK. The movie is about relationships and feelings, and perhaps the cut-rate cast is just not up to the challenge of making it believable. Or, perhaps the script is poorly written. Whatever the reason, I found the moving unabsorbing and thus uninteresting."
2,DVD Strictly sexual,"That not movie that would be worth to keep in your collection. One time watch is enough (even so, I fall asleep at first time and only second time watched it)Simply, nothing special and predictable."
4,How to Sell Anything on Ebay and Make a Fortune,This book has mostly the basics I already knew but I still would recommend it.
3,Review,"Book made it clear that eBay is very complicated.I will rarely, if ever, sell anything on eBay."
3,"Good overall, but cheap supply connectors","If not for the supply connectors it would have received 4 stars. Unfortunately, those are just plain cheap. The plastic itself is easily scratched and soft. Additionally, one of my connectors is not threaded properly - again, due to the cheap plastic. That in itself that isn't too big of a concern since it remains functional. However, while tightening the screws, one of them sheared. Considering I was only using pliers and the other 3 screws had no difficulty this probably falls under bad quality control. All is well with a bit of glue... the kit is superior to the worn out ones in my university's labs and the wires are useful. It gets the job done, but you can probably find a better one."
4,Arrived damaged,"The breadboard itself seems fine. The problem was that it was damaged prior to packaging. One corner was bent down to the point that it would not sit level. Clearly done prior to packaging, and should not have shipped. In any case, needed the item and dreaded a return process. Straightened the corner on an anvil and spray painted it to match. Seems okay now.The jumpers that came with it are more flexible than they appear in the pictures, so are more usable than you might think."
3,Not Bad -- Not Great!,"Not bad for the price, but not great either. The banana receptacles must be assembled and they're not high quality at all -- loosen up easily and no locking nuts. Once you have power attached to them -- leave 'em alone or they'll fall apart. Also, the jumper wires bend real easy when trying to put them into the component holes. It's like they get stuck trying to go in, so you have to force them carefully. I think I'll go for better quality all the way around next time. But you get what you pay for and the seller was prompt and efficient."
5,A great family movie,"I heard about this movie when I was watching TV on a commercial. I wanted to know what ages it would be appropriate for. I have two daughters at home and I didn't want some unappropriate movie on the TV while the kids are watching. So I found out it was ok to let them watch. Well in some parts it's so funny! The movie is about these spies who work for the 0SS and they try to stop the ""Timekeeper"" because he is speeding up time. I would say this is a great movie night movie to watch."
1,One star for over 13; three stars for under 13,"For kids under the age of 13 that probably haven't seen the previous movies and consider any green screen and CGI action as engrossing and really don't care about acting and storyline then give it three stars for them.For everyone else over the age of 13 the story is going to be boringly uncreative; green screen and CGI effects just passable and certainly less than what even video games and TV offer especially the flying, action and freeze frame effects. The acting by all ages was too scripted i.e. read-the-lines robotic. Freezing time as well as family discord between the children and parents is the same old worn-out storyline hook used by unimaginative writers. The holographic computer monitors and gadgets with lots of colored lights and bizarre effects is totally been-there, done-that unimaginative.On the money making side this version as well as past Spy Kids versions do make a lot of money off of their cheap production costs."
3,Good but....,"My grandson could hardly wait for me to order this movie, as he has watched the first three Spykids movies over and over. Spykids 4 has not held his attention-he has watched it once. I think for a five year old the leap to a grown up spykids was hard to grasp. I watched with him and I felt that the story was thin--a sequel that just couldn't quite make it. Should have stopped at Spykids 3."
3,Movie OK 3D not,"The 3D content is no where to be found if you are looking for the pop-out of screen, which I am. Yes people and objects are 3D that's about it,sorry"
1,My kids didn't even like it WARNING:SPOILER,"Jessica Alba plays a spy turned mom who is so sneaky no one in her family knows. Of course, by the end of the movie her husband and all the kids are involved, including the baby and the original Spykids are reunited.My family enjoyed the first three Spykids movies so of course we had to see the fourth. They shouldn't have bothered making the fourth. There is too much bathroom humor including poopy diaper and vomit bag ammo. It wasn't even funny.In fact, I didn't think it was worth my time to review, but my older daughter said I should warn others--so my kids didn't even like it."
3,Good only for light depression sufferers,I have been suffering from depression some 20+ years and so when I saw this book I thought how wonderful it would be to combine spirituality with other tools to help one overcome depression.As I read the book I do admit to feeling disappointed by it... The exercises and meditations are good for those suffering with short-term light depression but if you are someone that suffers from a deep depression then this is not the book for you.I can't knock the author for her attempt at wanting to help others cope with depression by way of spirituality. For that she gets my utmost respect.
2,A little disappointing,It is a little different than what I expected. This is not the fault of the author.
4,Needs bigger numbers,"I bought this for my left handed husband, who had two comments:The numbers need to be bigger and I'll probably still read it upside down."
3,Good book but not for all Youth Group situations,"When buying this book we thought it was a book that we could use for the normal times with our kids. What we found was most of the games are for outdoor situations or camp environments. Not a very practical book for a 10 minute ice breaking game or a game to do in the youth room. If you want ideas for camp, a lock in or a night out, this is your book. But if you're looking for a game to do after worship or during class you might want to keep looking."
2,too general,Lots of good overview info but the specifics are vague and useless. I already knew how it works and wanted to learn to do it!
5,GREAT product!,This perfume has always been a favorite. It's perfect for the summer its light fresh and feminine. The size is very generous for the price.
4,New Orleans history,"My grandfather was an actor in this movie. He played a ""bad"" guy that started the dock fire and he's in a couple extra scenes. I so enjoyed seeing him. He died on my birthday in 1984 and It's been so long since I have seen him. I loved seeing a bit of my own history as well as N.O.'s history. Thanks Columbia!"
1,too graphic for kids,"I bought this for my 8 year old son for Christmas and ended up returning it before I gave it to him. Luckily I looked through it before I wrapped it. I was a little too graphic with the blood and killing of babies and all. Might be OK for teenagers, they like that stuff. It was hard to see the cute little minifigs getting tortured."
4,New Orleans Movie Review,"Tells the story of the emergence of Dixieland Jazz primarily through the background love story of two charasmatic people - Miralee Smith, a talented opera singer, and Nick Duquesnes, owner of a Jazz Club-cum-gambling joint, who were at opposite ends of the social strata. Musical renderings by Billie Holliday, Louis Armstrong and Woody Herman, among others, make it a unique and memorable movie. There is no other movie like this one out there!"
3,Must have Hard Drive to play!! Haven't played yet on XBox,"Had this for the Playstation years ago with my older son. Younger son has discovered Spongebob and LOVES him. Got him the movie and the game. Well mom didn't know if you have the new XBox 360 Slim, you will need an additional hard drive to play this game since it's only ""XBox"".....ugh...Be warned..don't make the same mistake I did. Now we have to go buy the hard drive! :p"
1,Exciting but overall very boring book,"The beginning of the book was good because of the trial with TJ. After the end of the trial the book is very boring until Cousin Bud comes. When Suzella comes it gets exciting until she leaves. Stacey leaves and the children sit around dumbfounded,""Where could he be??"" Their parents are the only proactive ones in the this sitution send telgrams, letters and Papa looks for Stacey by going to the sugar cane plantations. The story ends with no definate ending and making you annoyed. I think this book is better than Roll of Thunder Here my Cry,but most of the book it is SO BORING!!!!!!!!!!! It is so boring you will not want to keep reading it.WARNING: DO NOT READ THIS BOOK!!!!"
2,BORING,I was forced to read this book for my Reading class. It was way to long and confusing. No body in my class enjoyed this book.
2,I personally didn't like it,"I read this book with my classmates, and I didnt want to finish it because I thought it was so boring. Fortunely, I did and knew what happened in the end. Read other book instead. This is just my opinion, don't take it personally."
5,Review - Let the Circle Be Unbroken,"Cassie and her family are going through hard times, but a fire mysteriosly starts and burns a good quater of their cotton,and T.J. is about to be lynched, so they do their best to stay together, then other tradgedies pop-up that could cause heart-ache, lose of land and even death. I agree with how the author wrote the story. It's in the eyes of an 11-year-old-girl growing up in 1934. A time of Great Depression and segregation. She writes what she thinks a child of that time would think about the bitter world and it's inhabitants. I would recommend this book to someone who can actually face the truth.And will be affected by it but not take prejudice or harm against it."
2,Boat Hull Cleaner,The MaryKate On and Off Gel Hull Cleaner did not clean our boat good.The Hull cleaner at Wal-Mart was more effective.
3,Great Container- No plants,"The container is really cute and a good value for the price. However, none of my seeds sprouted into plants. (And I generally have a pretty green thumb). Will have to buy new soil, seeds, etc... Nice set if you just want the pots but don't count on the seeds actually growing."
5,Works Great!,"This is a great way to start an herb garden. Everything you need is included. For the reviewers that say the herbs didn't grow, remember you are starting with seeds, and seeds need heat, water and lots of light. I used a plant lamp and I had herbs growing in four days."
5,Great weeknight meals!,"I love this cookbook. The recipes are delicious and best of all they are easy enough to prepare after the work-day. I would highly recommend this book for people looking to eat healthfully during the week, but don't have time for long preparations and piles of pots and pans once the meal is over. I'll be buying the Moosewood Simple Suppers cookbook next."
2,fish in packet was mushy!,"I got the moosehead dessert book first and that book blew my mind, i plan on buying that book. so i figured i'd borrow the moosehead cook at home book. Since I love fish, the first thing i tried was Asian fish in a packet. I followed the instructions to the letter, used a lot of aluminum to put the fish, rice , veggies, and sauce in an aluminum packet and after 20 minutes of steaming in a 450 Degree oven, my fish turned into unedible mush, the consistency felt like something between applesauce and mashed potatoes. the sauce that drizzled underneath the rice was quite tasty but the fish was totally ruined. I'll give this book another try and do a recipe other reviewers raved about, but this first experience was certainly disappointing."
4,boat owner,it sounds ok have not had long still playing with amp(Dual 400w peak) to get it right but it will shake the whole boat
1,Did nothing,"For me, this did nothing. I need support medially, & this gave me no support medially or laterally.I used the Mueller Max knee strap black one size, & that did the trick & works. A bonus with the mueller, I can kneel on that knee, & the strap supports my weight & cushions that knee. I am 240#."
5,for the honor of grey skull...,The DVD set arrived in perfect condition and when it was scheduled to arrive. The DVD is the complete series and we have had no problems with the DVDs themselves. The episodes are fun to watch and share with my daughter. I remember watching He-Man and She-Ra as a child. This is a good collector's set.
3,"Closer to the original tale? Um, no.","The editorial review for this movie is waaaay off. Prince Kynd to marry Dorothy? When does she reach the age of eighteen? Snowball a human? Uncle Henry not Dorothy's uncle and a jerk? From the cover picture, it looks like an older black and white version. From the editorial review, I would guess the screenwriter read all the Oz books years before and only vaguely remembered bits from the different books and winged it when he wrote the screenplay. It might be fun to own. I am tempted. Two and a half stars for uniqueness."
5,funny and factual,Mr. Thompson has written a book that beginners will like for its information and clarity while more advanced birdwatchers will enjoy for it fresh insight and humor. The pictures and artwork will also be useful for everyone. Highly recommened!
4,A fun game,This is a great deal for that neice or nephew that has everything. I gave it to my 6-year-old neice for Christmas and she loved it.
1,compiler was the best thing about the book,I do not think this book is good for self study. The computer tutorial was slow and the text was not clear on several critical areas like using tables. The only reason to get the book is for the compiler which is pretty good. Get the book for the compiler then get one of the better books written by English speakers. The teaching style of the book is better suited to Eastern Bloc students than Americans. I write this as a former cobol instructor.
2,Started out good...ended up with WTF!?,I started reading this manga and was very happy to find yet another good manga to read. I seem to be attracted to the whole girl-acting-as-a-guy type of manga. So the story started off good. It was about a girl pretending to be a boy so she can play basketball. But as the story continued...and neared the ending...I discovered that it was becoming very dumb. The plot kinda died and people were acting in stupid ways and I'm sorry but I do not advise you to read it. It's kinda odd to right a review like this. I'm trying to explain this in the best way possible so here you go.Beginning = GOOD. ^-^Ending = GAHH. WTF!?!!?!? D<
4,very unhappy w delivery,It took a month to get the book when I paid for express shipping. I tried to cancel order with Amazon and the compnay by emailing and no response. Then Amazon took it out of registry with the confirmation number and I could not cancel. 4 weeks go by and then I receive it in the mail. Needless to say it had no use to me then. I was teaching a lecture block in which I need the questions and explanations as I had reviewed this text in the past. The lecture series was over before I received the book so very dissatisfied. The book itself can be a good tool for review I just did not like what happen with delivery and Amazon management.
4,Pretty Darned Good,"I have been a Sandra Boynton fan for many years. When my sister gave ""Philadelphia Chickens"" to my daughter we were hooked. Since then we have also purchased ""Rhino Tap"" and this one, ""Dog Train."" While Philadelphia Chickens is still my favorite, my 5-year-old prefers this one. I do truly love the song ""Evermore"" and feel that it was worth the money for this song alone. Also, as with the other Boynton CDs, I don't cringe when she asks to hear it over and over again. I've even given it to some friends who are new parents and swore they'd never listen to kids' music, and they have been won over. Again, not my most favorite, but still well worth it."
5,top notch kids music,"If you are a fan of rock and roll this CD is fantastic. The music is superb, the lyrics are witty and fun and the performances are first rate. I just bought it a few days ago and now every time we get in the car my 3 year old is asking for the title song performed by Blues Traveler. ""Mama-DOG TRAIN, pweeze!"" ""Pots and Pans"" is a second favorite. He likes the rest of the album too and so do I. Parents, you'll enjoy it just as much as your kids will."
2,Way too cool for a little kid,I would not recommend this book for a little kid. I've got two 3 year old girls and it's way too loud and way too grown-up for little kids. I don't think it's appropriate. We have Philadelphia Chickens too and I would rate that a 5 star. That one is inspiring. This one is like letting your kid watch Saturday Night Live.
4,"Easy to use, performs well, but the display is somewhat dim","This clock is average in almost every way. It has an average alarm, an average radio, and average user controls. The only problem I have with it is that I was hoping for a much brighter display, and sadly this one is medium-to-dim on the brightness scale. If, however, you're looking for a basic and reliable clock with standard features, this is your guy. I suspect one could get a similar product for one or two dollars cheaper, but I recommend this one in any case. It's a solid, average clock."
1,Makes a good doorstop,"It worked alright for the first two months or so. My second summer it got less and less cooler. Now it will knock about 5 degrees off the outside temp. I contacted the service dept and it is past one year, so if I want it fixed (the sealed system is supposed to be covered) I have to pay a 88 dollar service fee. In other words it's going in the trash where it belongs."
4,Terrific money value,"I'm very, very pleased with this air conditioner. It is compact and puts out a good amount of cold air. It's quiet. It has many different options and modes to choose from. I have nothing but good to say about it. I wouldn't hesitate to buy another one for myself and would readily recommend it."
4,The Best,I recommend this product. If ever you should buy a airconditioner this is the best brand around. Energy cost does not go up. It keeps my 12 x 15 room cool.
3,Decent,"It works fairly well and I like having the remote. It certainly saved me on those 100 degree days, that's for sure. The filter light comes on more often than I would expect it to, but I suppose living in NY, the air quality isn't as great as other places. I put it in a small room, but it still doesn't seem to get it as cold as it could. Best when you can be right in front of it, otherwise plan to still be a little hot."
5,"Great Musical Concert, David's Re-recorded vocals... FAIL!","He's not singing live on this concert... You can still catch a few parts where the microphone is out of his mouth and ""words"" keeping coming; and his voice sounds angelical... Typically Coverdale is not sound that good live, not even on his peek years... to bad for fans like me... :("
2,What happened to DC?,"I used to be a big Whitesnake fan. Coverdale was one of rock's greatest singers, with a dark, powerful and bluesy style. Their music from 1979 until 1983 is the greatest in the genre.Then it became 1987. Suddenly Coverdale thought Whitesnake needed to sound big and look like blond hookers. The following years he tried to sound like Robert Plant more and more. I do not understand why. The guy is screaming like a housewife. He looks as if he just had a facejob to make him look more like a chick. He has completely lost it. Listen to Judgement Day and tell me he does not try to be a Led clone. Still Of The Night same thing.And the flashy guitar playing is tasteless, in the older songs anyway. I can't see why everybody is so excited about this [...] Listen to Live...In The Heart Of The City (1980) and you'll hear a good band."
3,Coverdale/Aldridge,"Even if you just watch Tommy pound his kit for the whole show,it,s worth the price.The sound is good and the first song""Burn/Stormbringer""is awesome....."
5,Great Addition to a Great Series,I waited with more anticipation then the next Harry Potter book. It was well worth the wait. I absolutely love this book. I wish Simone was my big sister. I think this would make a bigger blockbuster movie than Harry Potter. I'd even wait in line overnight.
2,"Decent no frills, get the job done kit.","The Boss kit looks similar to other install kits but is substantially less money. When this arrived I found out how they achieved the 1/2 price standard. The wire in this kit looks like it is the same gauge as the competition but when you look at it's cross section it is really only thin stereo wire with a really thick plastic jacket. A little disappointing but when you look at the fuse holder you'll see it's a blade style with no mounting options and VERY inexpensively made. All in all this kit will work to install an amplifier, however it is a all expense spared kit. In hind sight I would just spend the extra money and get a higher quality kit."
3,"ehh, its ok",Seems a little skimpy on wire diameter. Works fine for my needs though and have not had any problems months later.
2,wiring kit.,everything they said was there but very cheep made. 10 gauge wire was very small for 10 gauge and connectors were very poor made. fuse link was ok but will not take a very powerful amp
2,MORE A BOOK ON GUIDE QUESTIONS THAN ACTIVITIES,"I was disappointed with this book. Most of the activities were introspective questions (pencil and paper tests).I was expecting activities that participants can use to improve their EQ. It was not like that at all. I wouldn't recommend this book to trainers who are looking for activities to make their EQ based workshops more interactive.Perhaps that is the reason why no sample of the ""activities"" were included in the preview of the book."
2,I like this book but....,"The book was very nice, and easy to follow to do the activity.But, I received the book which has bad condition.Might be that is a reason why the price is low.Anyway, the content of this book is good."
1,I didn`t receive my item,"I HAVE ORDERED A THE BOOK COMPUTER BASED TOEFEL ESSAY, BUT I DIDN`T RECEIVE IT BECAUSE THEY PRETEND THAT THEY DIDN'T FIND THE ADRESS.ALSO, I DIDN'T RECEIVE THE REFUND."
5,Exceptional Blend of Fantasy and History,I just found this book at a thrift store. I read it within three hours... I recommend this to Anyone under the sun...
4,Pump works very well,"I am still getting used to this pump, but it functions very well. The pump meets our needs and the cost was minimal compared to some other pumps."
4,some parts good; some parts so-so,I got this as a replacement for one that became uncalibrated and was pleased that this came with a tool for re-adjusting the calibration. VERY NICE.The only thing I didn't like was that the ear pieces were a little twisted and pretty uncomfortable. So I swapped those out with my old ones and that fixed the issue.I'm happy with this purchase and would recommend.
3,All in one manual BP cuff,"This product was okay. As a nurse I may be a little too critical of the product. I liked the idea of an all in one (stethescope and cuff together) but am uncertain as to how accurate it is. I have a digital as well for comparison and the BP's were significantly different. I would buy it again to incorporate into a first aid kit (for the value) but for those untrained in a manual BP reading, I would buy a digital. However BE SURE the digital only inflates one time and takes a reading. Some digitals inflate 3 times and then give you a mean value. This is inaccurate as you should not keep taking a BP x 3 in the same arm and expect an accurate value. It is also too time consuming in an emergency situation."
2,"snap, crackle, and pop","This blood pressure monitor appears to be well made and sells for an attractive price. Alas, the nylon material the cuff is made from makes audible noise when it flexes (deflates). As a result, it's next to impossible to tell when the pulse becomes inaudible. This renders it unusable."
3,Very QuickStart,This book is rather short but I guess that is by design. a Long book would not really be a QUICK start. It covered the basics though.
5,Don't leave this book behind!,"If you read the Left Behind series (and even if you don't) read this book. I do have to correct what was written in the synopsis on this site: ""Margaret Nutting Ralph attempts to correct what she claims are misinterpretations and misreadings of Scriptures that deal with the end of the world"". NO, it's not what SHE claims are misinterpretations. Please remember that she is teaching a contextualist way to read scripture. This is not something she invented. This is what the Catholic Church teaches. If you pick up a copy of the study edition of the New American Bible, you will find the same viewpoint. You'll also find it in the JErome Biblical Commentary. Also if you read the books by Raymond Brown."
1,Dumbest Book in the world,"I tkink this book is not good to read. This book is for 10 year olds or under. In this story Fudge is not a good character . He only thinks about money. Then they talk about his dad's lost Cousin.I think they should add a best friend for dad, like a lost best friend. It's more itresting. I think this story is good for ESL."
1,Really Inferior Product,A really sorry product. Its control buttons do not work a lot. The ad says that it had digital tuning. Lie. Lie. It is an AM crank dial to find a station. Amazon should have caught that.Buy a Sony or Panasonic and find some quality.
3,Disatisfied,my free USB CABLE was not sent to me so I was forced to go out and buy a cable. Perhaps you should contact me on this matter.
1,carrier stall,"i've had it with this mach. it has so many problems i don;t know were to start.for one thig i keep getting a ""carrier stall"" message. when i called lexmark for help they said that they never heard of a carrier stall messg. i asked the support guy how it is that it's in the mach. problem display and yet he never heard of it.the collor is very poor and i would think that it would be a smart move for them if they gave the mach. for free and for the price they charge for the cartridges they could make out like bandits. DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT THIS UNIT."
2,"Nice Printer, but no Linux drivers",This is a nice printer... if you have Windows or Mac. If you have Linux then I would avoid this machine. Lexmark has decided in their infinite Wisdom that Linux user are not worth the effort. I know now that I will NEVER buy another Lexmark product. They are not a company that cares about what their customers are running as an OS.
4,GPS case,"Very nice case for your GPS system, but the same case at Walmart sells for 9.95 (ten dollars) cheaper less freight."
4,Nice bag but too small for all the GPS stuff,"I took a chance and this bag is too small to put the Nuvi 855, friction mount, power cable in without taking it all apart and packing it all in nicely. Forget about adding other stuff in like remote antenna, hard-shell case for the 855, other accessories, etc. I'd like a case that is just big enough to grab the Nuvi with friction mount with cord, and plop it all in without having to disassemble it all first. And then be able to take it out and hook it up in the car without having to reassemble everything again. Will keep looking...Construction wise, this bag seems well made and has adequate padding."
2,Ok but not for me!,"I just purchased a Garmin Nuvi 760 & friction dash mount! Well this case is.. ok! has soft inside, good construction, yes you can fit your plug, gps & mount but cant really fit my friction mount inside also like was hoping! this is too small for what i want & too big for just the gps! pretty much just 1 big bag with a Velcro divider in the center! i have a 4.3"" screen & it will slide & i think the cables can jump around & scratch it! so i am about to go to the store to go buy a hard case to put inside here for my gps! & just carry my xm in here too!"
5,Hornady quality and works with .357 Maximum out of the box,"Typical Hornady quality. I prefer them over Lee and RCBS. These Hornady dies come with a seating die that works with .357 Maximum (typically spitzer style) bullets. In researching dies for this cartridge, it seems that at least the Lee dies do not work with spitzer bullets out of the box."
4,Nice flag! but color fades quickly...,"The flag is very nice. Its well made as far as structure. The fabric is sturdy. However, it does seem to be fading in color faster then I would prefer for the cost. I probably should have bought one that is stitched rather then printed."
5,Just as ordered,"I am very happy with this order, the DVDs were just as described; new and shrink wrapped. Delivery was faster than I expected. The set was bought as a gift and my Mother said they are all perfect so far. Thank you for your quick service."
2,False advertising!,"As amazing as it would have been to finally watch the famed MURDER SHE WROTE/MAGNUM P.I. crossover as it originally aired -- and, as the packaging would lead you to believe, should also appear in this box set -- they included the WRONG VERSION of the ""Magnum"" episode. When it was originally created, they shot the episode with two endings: The ""to be continued"" ending for the crossover, and then a self-contained ending for syndication purposes. The DVD packagers grabbed the wrong version! AAAARGH! This is an awfully expensive package for such a sloppy mistake."
3,Don't expect it to be exactly like the computer game,"I initially got hooked on Cake Mania when playing it at Yahoo games and when it was available for Nintendo DS, I was so excited that I pre-ordered the game. When I finally got it a few weeks later, I was pretty disappointed as it wasn't as fun as playing it on the computer. First of all, because the screen is so small, whenever Jill moves from one end of the kitchen to another, the screen moves with it causing me to hit the wrong frosting color/cake shape/cake topping icon. Secondly, I think there's a bug in the program because the game will crash in the middle of a session or it'll fail to recognize that I picked up the cash for a customer, leaving the spot filled.All in all, this is a fun game (hence the 3 stars) but you'll be sorely disappointed if you expect it to be an exact replica of the computer game."
4,Loads of fun!,"I was looking for a fun game to play and this one did not disappoint. At first I thought it was a little too easy, but as the game went on and got more challenging I enjoyed it. I like the PC version a bit better, but I was happy with this and would buy a sequel if there is one."
5,AN AWESOME TOOL FOR RECOVERY FROM LIFE,"BEING CLEAN ANDSOBER FOR 14 YEARS, I THOUGHT I HAD IT ALL TOGETHER. THIS BOOK HAS HELPED ME REALIZE ONCE AGAIN THAT CHEMICALS WERE JUST A SYMPTOM OF A LIVING PROBLEM. AND I STILL HAVE A PROBLEM. IT HAS HELPED ME HET TO THE CORE OF CERTAIN ISSUES, AND BEGIN TO WORK THROUGH THEM.. I HIGLY RECOMMEND THIS BOOK."
4,"Helpful, Christ-centered","I am just starting chapter four....we are doing this with a small group of Christian women who all have had family qualifiers whom they love. It is a thought producing, inspirational guide that aides you, though trust in Christ, in whatever situation you find yourself --Alcohol, drugs,gabling,internet addictions of any kind. An aide to recovery, 12 step program that is Christ centered."
2,"good book, poorly bound","I enjoy this version of many familiar prayers, but I'm most disappointed that the binding has been loose and became so within a week of very little use and careful handling."
5,Eye-Opening Piece of History in Avant-Garde Style,"This book sheds light on a really eye-opening bit of history in the free-for-all boomtown that San Francisco was in the late 19th Century. The style is interesting as well: a contemporary Chinese immigrant to the US speaks directly to a Chinese prostitute in the 19th Century, experiencing her life in those turbulent times and seeing what has changed and what has not. The prostitute, Fusang, is enigmatic because she defies categorization. She does not need to be rescued and, despite her lot, she is not an object of pity. She is who she is, accepts her fate, and has an almost Boddhisattva-like compassion for those who wrong her."
3,"A historical figure, at a distance","The Lost Daughter of Happiness centers on Fusang, a real historical figure who was a prostitute in nineteenth-century San Francisco. The author (with some authorial intrusion, as she describes her process) very vividly describes Fusang's world. Two men love her - a young white boy who develops an obsession, and a Chinese gangster who surprises himself with his feelings for her. For the reader, the source of the men's feelings remain a bit unclear because Fusang never quite comes into focus. The closest she comes is when, with her secret smile, she realizes herself to be ""a thief who steals pleasure from suffering"". To live is enough for her, but she does not fear death. She knows no sorrow or anger at her (often horrible) circumstances, and neither does she concern herself with the suffering of others around her. For this reason, the reader is unable to grab onto her experience - she keeps receding into the background of her vivid surroundings."
3,Raymond and Hannah exposes the boundaries of religious differences,"This novel is a clear and honest portrayal of love in the face of culture clash - Raymond, the academic aesthete versus Hannah, in training to become ""a good Jew"". Whether or not the ""love conquers all"" mantra applies here is for the reader to find out. The unusual format might at first seem distracting, but pulls you in the more you read. An engaging first novel from Stephen Marche."
3,More about Corelli!!!,"The book is ok as a source of first information. It is written by someone who definitely loves Corelli. Yet we lack another book about this great singer and personality, more psychologically written. There is the same problem as with everything nowadays:Really interesting material that is not destined to be bought by a great lot of people but only by ""some"" interested ones is not sold any more by the great companies (neither by amazon.com!). This concerns good books (eg even the not so famous ones of truly famous authors) or rare recordings (eg Corelli and Tebaldi Met Gala for Rudolf Bing, singing Manon Lescaut...). It just shows that ""culture"" is constantly diminishing to ""mass- and subculture"". O tempora..."
4,Unreasonable,It was a pretty good movie from three 6. Its just they should have had more of the members from three 6 mafia in it and it was an UNREASONABLE ending how.... Well I'm not gonna spoil it for people who haven't seen it but it was a surprising ending.
2,Could be better. Pick something else.,"I purchased this battery charger combo less than a year ago with less than 200 charge cycles and while it worked ok (not great), it's performance has steadily gotten worse over time.The batteries only hold a charge for 2-3 days at best and from what I can tell, they are never fully charged (as checked with a multimeter).I've tried other brand batteries (Rayovac, Duracell, etc...) and the charger refuses to charge them. The status light just blinks. I should have spent a bit more for a better charger.I'm going to sell this unit to someone else and get the charger that I should have gotten in the first place."
4,"Easy to load, be cautious of bumping though",This spool is a snap to replace. Since it is designed for non-bump models of trimmers you do have to be cautious of accidently bumping the bottom on the ground. If used right you will be thankful for not having to deal with spring loaded spool replacements older bump models had.
3,Not impressed...,"I have the Black & Decker GH1000 so unfortunately you are stuck using their proprietary line spool. I have had my GH1000 for about 2 1/2 years now and have spent a lot of time using it. At about $10 bucks a pop they aren't cheap, and mine seem to jam all the time. The line is forever coming out of the hole on the spool and I have to stop edging and fix it. Sometimes 2 or 3 times just to edge the front and back lawn. (I have a pretty average size yard too.) Then when you insert it back into the edger, the lines comes out too much to adjust for fixing it and pieces of the line go flying every where. Dangerous and a waste of line! Honestly, I can't wait for my GH1000 to die so I can buy something else."
1,He compromises the Bible to save face with men!,"According to Ross, God going down the ""Progressive Creation"" highway of millions of years of time, leaving ""Road-Kill"" where ever He goes? Is God cruel, sadistic and extremely wasteful? Is that ""Very"" Good? He does! Do You?"
3,"Starts quiet, gets loud... Everytime!","I'm on my 3rd pump in 4 years... but I will probably by another.This pump is super-quiet when you first get it however it ALWAYS grows louder with prolonged use. At its loudest it is still quieter than most other pumps I have used thus the reason I will continue to use this model. But I do wish it remained as quiet as when you first install it. The air it produces remains strong despite the increased noise level.I use one of these for a 55 gallon goldfish tank and have tried several arrangements with different air disks/ stones/ statues etc. I have merged both air outlets into one tube and two tubes independently and this doesn't really change things, the noise level will increase over timeAmazon's price is GREAT compared to what Petco/ Petsmart sell it for."
3,Tetra ROAR,"This thing is 5 stars in the air output department, but dude... my cousin and I named it ""the KAMA3"" (a communist era soviet diesel truck that was VERY loud) and I mean loud! right out of the box and this thing is roaring. I'm using both outputs with a T connection and regulating flow for a couple undergravel filters and 2 airstones in a 55 Gal tank. This pump leaves a rescued penguin 350 I have in too (whose impeller seems to have fought in WW2, Korea and Vietnam) in the floor when it comes to noise, And I thought I had a diesel truck with the penguin... I think I'm gonna install it in the patio and route the tubing back to the bedroom 'cause right now I feel like I slept beneath my grandma's fridge last night."
2,Whisper Air Pump,I purchased this pump for my 29 gallon aquarium. It quit working well short of the first year. Much to the manufacturers credit they said they would replace the unit. The Tech explained that this pump was too large for my tank and failed probably due to excessive back pressure? He indicated he would send me two of the 40 gallon size models! Problem was that they sent one 40 gal. and one 20 gal. size. What gives!!!! Maybe he did the math and 40 + 20 = 60 !!!!!!!
5,Angel Catcher,"This is a wonderful tool to use when navigating through the grieving process and you use it at your own pace as you begin to heal. You can use it daily, weekly, yearly, the pace is up to you. As you begin to fill the pages with thought, mourning, and reflection, you may have the opportunity to find meaning in adversity and move forward."
2,Umm.. Huh?,"This book has me rather baffled. On the one hand, the space-borne battle scenes are rather good. On the other hand, the planet-side battle scenes are rather not.I can't really say I recommend this one as a purchase, but pick it up at the library for a half-way interesting read.Oh, and note to the authors: the climax of the book traditionally falls somewhere near the END of the book. Not the middle."
3,Marginally Ok,"This product is one of those that looks better in pictures than it does on the floor. No backing so it has limited use on tile floors where I intended to use them......Oh well, thats what happens when you buy online sometimes."
4,"Quality Modern Rug, Exceeded Expectations!","This rug for the price was the best i could find. I love shopping around but once i found this rug and it arrived i was beyond ecstatic! The perfect size, color, & quality! Thanks amazon."
3,Meh.....,"I was excited about this cd because I own about every other lifescapes celtic cd, but I just really wasn't too impressed with this one.Too much ""folk"" music."
1,Bait and Switch,"I ordered this particular item because I wanted the frame and mat that is shown on the site.....but that is not what I get.........I get a black plasticy type frame with a white mat........?????...........when I called I'm informed Amazon has no control over the fulfillment center.......?????..............I believe this is called bait and switch.....this photo of Ben Hogan is available all over the internet at varying prices....several of them much cheaper than this one......but I purchased this one because I believed I was getting the frame and mat that is shown........but you do not and apparently that mat and frame is unavailable......why they are still advertising it, I do not know."
1,False Scholarship,"Brown hopes you take his word at face value, because if you check his sources you will find that his work is misleading. Brown raises age-old arguments -- all of which have been disproven many times over. There is nothing new or original in this book."
2,meh,Its ok. One or two good songs on here. The rest are easily forgettable. I don't even think I bothered to put it on my ipod after I listened. If you are a 'Bravery' fan then I guess its worth it. I'll sell you my copy if you like hahha
1,Horrible! Don't waste your money.,This adapter lasted less than two months before some of the plastic started to melt and start smoking. It is a potentially very dangerous item and not worth spending any money on. Look for a charger that has a warranty to save your money!
1,Very bad quality,I bought 2 of these and they stopped working after less than one month. Do not buy it.
1,Terrible quality - likely destructive to laptop,"The adaptor lasted less than a month. The cords themselves were fine (my previous one frayed), but when I plugged the adaptor in, it triggered almost an epileptic state in my laptop: monitor flashing on and off rapidly, and crashing if I didn't unplug immediately.Do NOT buy this. Suck up the more expensive cost for a real Lenovo adaptor. It won't last long, but at least it won't cause your laptop to destroy itself."
4,Please do your research,The 90W power supplies are for the docks. You guys want to order a 65watt 20v. Not sure if theyre swappable but I would imagine thats the source of the damage.
3,Marginal banana/power sockets,"The protoboards and aluminum substrate seem of good quality, but the four banana/power terminals supplied are cheap junk. They're probably fine if you don't remove them more than once or twice, but any more than that and they might fail. Comes with a wiring kit which might save some time stripping wires I guess. Also four rubber feet included.Price was too high. Exact same item is available new from surplus electronics houses on-line for about half this price. My Prime subscription made the price with free 2-day shipping just close enough to make it worthwhile, although still a little over the surplus store."
1,If monkey ... had a name,"This CD was horribly put together. The videos are choppy, poor quality. The navigation is very confusing to follow, and the ""interviews"" are all just self-serving ... by her cronies. It's obvious Trask is under the spell of ""look how great I think I am,"" rather that putting together a truly educational CD. When somebody writes their own review of their work saying that its ""widely considered a masterpiece"" and fails to quote any actual sources, you know you're getting gyped out of [money]."
1,Mini SD support - conditional on buying an adapter,"I was disappointed when the product arrived. The website says that it works with Mini SD cards and the packaging says also. But niether say that you need an adapter. Then finally when you cut open the plastic and read the instructions, it has an asterisk and says ""Mini SD needs an adapter which is not included with the product."" What a waste of time."
1,Word for word rip-off,A number of reviewers have noted that major portions of this book are a near word for word copying of Cialdini's Influence. It actually copies nearly word for word 2 books and one journal article.The books are Cialdini's Influence and Pratkanis and Aronson's Age of Propaganda.The journal article can be found in the California Management Review.
4,my daughter loves the furniture for her dollhouse,My daughter loves the furniture for her dollhouse. She plays with it every day. The best psrt of the family room is the television that changes channels.
1,update: needs some improvement. pretty much sucks,"i bought this case a few years ago. since then, i have cut out the plastic in the front because the case is so soft the buttons would get lost behind the plastic. the gps gets turned around in the case and makes it impossible to locate and use any of the buttons. don't like it for that reason. when i cut the plastic out, it made the case less ridged which made it even worse. they are cheap for a reason. don't waste your time."
5,Recoil!,"As I am The First Person to Review this Movie I am Giving it 5 stars Cause Recoil is by far the Most Action Packed Movie ever Made by PM Entertainment.The Storyline is Ok its basically about a Mans wife and kids who get Killed.And as for the Action in it its Awesome they put a lot of Crashes in this Movie and they are GOOOOOD!And it is also Gary Daniels only and Best Movie he ever made.Trust Me People this Film is worth a Buy you,ll love it if your an Action Fan like me."
3,Mixed bag,"Useful information but surprisingly low production values, and a bit hard to hear. The cover art makes it look more professional than it is."
4,Excellent Value,"I use this in my piano service business. It's great for cleaning out the dust from pianos. Works as promised. The only thing I was uncertain about was something in the manual that mentioned what to do if the unit overheats. But it didn't say anything about how you know it overheats. ???Other than that minor thing, I love it!"
4,vac&blo,The vac& blo does good at getting water dryed off my car but probably takes just as much time as hand drying. It could use more power
2,Arrived rusted.,"I haven't even used it yet. When I unpacked it, there was rust around the hinge fittings and around the interface of the removable cover. I may return it for a replacement."
5,For fans of the series,"""Six chilling stories of inner man and outer space from the famous television series."" [front cover blurb]Rod Serling's ""Night Gallery"" was more than an updated version of the ""Twilight Zone"", but a whole new take on his uniquely frightening scope on life. I remember sitting glued to the family TV - afraid to see what was coming, yet even more afraid to miss out!Contains:- The Sole Survivor- Make Me Laugh- Pamela's Voice- Does the Name Grimsby Do Anything to You?- Clean Kills and Other Trophies- They're Tearing Down Tim Riley's BarEnjoy!"
4,Great resource,"this book can be pretty dense at times, but it is a great resource for information and research on family therapy, as well as practice components."
4,Wonderful!! but....,"The voice of Domingo is wonderful & perfect.I'm sure that he is one of best Siegfrieds(such as Windgassen, Svanholm, and etc.) through history.The problem of this work, however, lies on other parts. First, is sound of Orchestra. Even though I did not hope that their sound is equivalent to that of Bayreuth, they are disappinting me.Second problem is ""Remastering"" methods. Because this work was recorded in Studio, they could remix and remastering sounds very easily. voice of Domingo is much bigger than that of orchestra, and sometimes I can not hear any sounds of strings in some important pharases ; only what I can hear are voice of him and sound of brass. I also wish tempo of song would be somewhat faster in siegfried's forging song.But, I can tell you, with my confidence, that art of Domingo is very brilliant & splendid.You will love it."
4,"A decent effort, but riddled with annoyances","This guitar strap is generally great for the price. Well worth the [...] price tag, and made of tightly sewn, tough material. It's nice and wide, and fairly comfortable as well. The downside(s) are the small annoyances that the design presents. For example, if it's worn in such a way that the plastic adjuster is on your shoulder, it, like, digs into your skin like a leech. Not that I wear my strap like that too often, but every now and then, It'll just slip and kill your shoulder. The other little defect is the adjuster's looseness. Sometime, the excess strap will just slip down and you'll find your guitar suddenly 5"" lower than you had it at previously. It doesn't seem to happen that often, and it doesn't get worse with time, like most products, but it can annoy the heck out of me sometimes.I hope this review was helpful."
1,bike stand,"this product broke the day i got it. i don't think it was represented correctly. i bought it to be used as a bike stand for training, i guess it was just for storage or fixing the bike. ????? who misunderstood, me or the information by the seller???"
2,Expensive! Not up to expectation,"I bought this for my tandem bicycle. Upon receiving it, i tried to put it up onto my tandem bike but realized that it couldn't fit into the FSA skewers, sob.....End up I need to change the skewers of my wheel set in order to allow this bicycle stand to fit onto my tandem bike. Waste of my time and was very disappointed with this design, as it was not universal enough. Furthermore it wasn't very ergonomic, requires practice and some skills to learn how to use it....Not really recommended."
1,Be careful of what you buy this for,"I bought this stand with the intention of allowing my wife to exercise her replaced knee, to achieve additional flexibility. I don't believe the unit's ad notes that this item is ONLY FOR DISPLAYING OR WORKING ON BICYCLES. Didn't know until I opened the box to set it up that you can't use it to mount a bike for exercise.Since it was a gift for my wife, didn't open the box until recently. Now I find that it's too late to return it. $50.00 +/- down the tubes."
5,Excellent pet bed,"Our irrascible old cat, who resists learning any new tricks, took to this pet bed within a few hours and has been 90% inseparable from it since. Heat is low enough he can stay on it indefinitely. Only problem is, he (and we) would be lost if it ever failed. Highly recommended."
2,Disappointing.,"The heat is barely noticeable and I suppose ""mild"" heat would be OK but it is only present in the VERY center in the bed.The vibration is not really noticeable at all. I can only hear it- cannot really feel it. The dog (who is deaf) does not even seem to notice when we turn the vibration feature on and off and he's a pretty skittish guy. Had I known these features were going to be so lame, I'd spent the same amount of $ on a bed with memory foam instead.(Did not purchase bed from Amazon. Ordered from another company at lower price but with very unreasonable restocking fee- so not returning it. Lesson learned- Always buy from Amazon!)"
5,Great Picture - No Buzzing Sound (after I returned the initial one),"This has the best DLP picture I have seen.DLPs can be a bit grainy. This one is not.As far as the buzzing noise, this does not seem to happen on all units.The first unit I got, did buzz. I took that one back and got another which is buzz free. In addition, none of the mitsubishis on the floor (at Fry's) buzz.The only thing I can think of is that my first set was manufactured in June 2007. The second one July 2007. So maybe this is something that was fixed.Now I am totally happy with this television.Watching sports in HD is just amazing."
3,"Light on Ginger, Heavy on Pear","Straight out of the package the aroma was a halting sweet and spicy with fruity undertones made even more potent when brewed. It's too bad that the taste couldn't live up to that exciting fragrance. From the name (Green Ginger) I expected to taste a bit more ginger and a lot less pear. To be clear, the tea was all right, but rather underwhelming for this ginger lover."
4,"Good Iced Tea, Not that good served hot though","I drink a lot of English teas, served hot with milk and sweetener as well as many Indian teas. This black tea tastes mediocre compared to larger brands of English tea... However, it is VERY good served as sweet iced tea. This is definitely a ice tea blend."
4,Tea for coffee drinkers,"I overall like Tazo's version of earl grey. The smell is more potent than other brands, of which I've grown to like. The taste is also stronger than my usual Bigelows. A coffee lover will like this version as the scent and taste hits you in the morning. I'm going to try other brands in search of the more timeless flavor of earl grey. I tried Tazo's English breakfast tea and was not impressed. While I like Tazo's version as a flavor of the month, I'll stick with more traditional brands for my black teas."
3,Too strong for my taste buds.,"So I typically enjoy strong tea. When brewing a cup of brown tea or making iced tea, I double up the amount of bags needed. With that said, the flavor in this one is overwhelming. Not horrible, but also not something I could drink on a regular basis. Black tea must not be my thing."
3,price,I purchased this tea at the very end of September 2010 and paid 19.46 for 6 boxes and now less than 6 months later it is 27.29. Seems like quite a price hike for the same item.
1,Awful,"The cup of pungent red liquid I experienced is nothing that I would even classify as tea. It is strong, acidic, and goes down like a batch of hot concentrated Kool-Aid sans sugar. Simply hideous. I do, however, love Tazo's 'Awake' and Earl Grey teas. :)"
1,Tazo lotus tea,"I opened up a brand new box of this tea today. The first teabag fell on the floor because the string wasn't attached, so I threw it away. I opened teabag#2 and the string wasn't attached to it either, but since it didn't fall on the floor I went ahead and used it. The bag broke during brewing, so the leaves were all over the inside of the cup. I dumped that one out and tried again with teabag #3, and the results were identical to teabag #2, so I just said ""Forget it!"". What are the odds of getting 3 defective bags in a row??? I now hate Tazo teabags."
5,Excellent,"John is a great modern jazz pianist - classically trained. He's been playing these tunes all his life. And it shows. This is a trio recording; piano, bass, and drums."
5,Square Angle Plate,"Hobbiests, modelers and miniaturists will find this angle plate very useful for keeping everything ""squared-up"" while gluing."
3,too light for me,"I bought this yo yo at Walmart . Although it has silicone friction stickers that last much longer you would be better off buying the avenger from the Duncan website yo-yo.com The avenger has much more weight which results in better spin time. As for string tricks. Forget it . The mosquito is a little too light for me , a beginner. And fragile . The avenger i have had for 2 months and it works great with spin times up to 30 seconds and returning to my hand."
4,Mosquito Yo-Yo is AWESOME!,"Pros: Long spin time, very durable (I have smashed it against the floor, the ceiling, and the wall several times, and it came out with barely a scratch), ball-bearing, mixture of classic and wing-(""flared"" shape), take-apart design. Cons: Spin time will decrease as string wears down, possible to lose parts of ball-bearing when you take apart the yo-yo, and when the friction stickers wear down, the Mosquito will be hard to bring back to your hand. Overall, an AWESOME yo-yo. I had a great experience with mine."
2,Fun for kids but adults beware,As another reviewer has already pointed out this toy will last forever and you will forever have the quacking sound in your brain.We bought this for our first son. It is because of toys like this that we are very careful now when we buy toys. To this day (nearly nine years later) I can still hear the quacking.
3,Quack Along Ducks Review,"So far this toy is doing ok. My daughter doesnt show much interest in it though. That may be just a personal thing with her, but most toys do grab her attention. I find this toy to be not as satisfying as others Ive purchased."
2,frustrating,"Last duck often turns over sideways, frustrating because it no longer rolls along, but is dragged. Both my kids became so aggravated by it, I had to put it away. Toy is also very noisy and has no volume control. Overall, not one of our favorites."
1,THIS TOY IS ANNOYING,"This toy was a gift for my one year old boy, and has annoyed the entire family ever since!!! It is loud, there is no off switch, and it topples over when pulled. I do not recommend"
4,Little Sissy's favorite toy,"My little Sissy got these ducks for Christmas, My sissy is almost two. She LOVES those ducks! She pulls them everywhere! (I really like them too!) My Mommy helped me write this, she likes the duckys too!"
1,Died after 6 weeks of light use,The ceramic end caps disintegrated after a couple months of use and the bulb fell to pieces in my hands when I removed it from our lamp.
2,Disappointed....,"I had a feeling this bag wasn't going to be what we needed, sadly I was right. Your pet has to be itty bitty for this to work under 3lbs... and short and not too chubby... getting my drift.Val Devine"
5,Prompt Service,Product was delivered promptly. Good value. Ideal for photographers who need a small gray card that will fit in their backpacks/sling packs.
5,GOOD shades!!,"I bought these a little over a year ago for cycling purposes. They are quite dark which is good in the hot sun. They completely cover my eyes, and eyebrows, which can be annoying because my eyebrows smear sweat on the top of the frame, blurring my vision somewhat. The best thing about these is the durability. I have yet to see a single scratch on them. I splash mud on them and wipe it off with no issues!I have since switched to custom Oakley Gascan's for daily wear, but I will wear these for cycling until they wear out. Possibly for decades!"
2,This book is based on opinions of the author.,"I've read many fasting books and this one was very disappointing. Patricia Bragg offers many opinions non of which are based in the facts I was looking for. The best book I've read so far on fasting is: ""Fasting and Eating for Health : A Medical Doctor's Program for Conquering Disease"" by Joel Fuhrman and Neal D. Barnard, which offers many medical references."
5,Great product!,This is a great product when in a hurry! I'm surprised at the price though. My store sells it for $3.49 bottle. When I'm traveling I can usually find this at Mexican markets even cheaper. I love Amazon - usually their products are less expensive than buying at stores.
4,Green tea is unisex,"Men or women can enjoy wearing this sent I believe, it's natural and soft for any sex to wear this or work or play!"
5,great scent,"I loved the smell, the packaging was fine and arrived before time. No complaints about this one.The bottle looks good too."
2,Does not last,"Although I initially liked the light fragrance, it does not hold at all. The staying power is zero and it is not even small enough to be carried on in your purse, so u can keep spraying yourself. Waste of money and didnt know that Amazon.com did not allow perfumes to be returned. Wish I knew before ordering :("
1,Not my thing ...............................,"Grant is always trying new things, which is very dangerous for an artist, and for his fan base. If you like this album, you might not like the last one or the next one.Me, I hate this one. I played it twice and I can't stand to play it again. I know people will love it, but not the people like me who loved ""In With The Out Crowd"". To those people I say try ""Business As Usual"" if you haven't already.Grant has moved on from my tastes, but I don't begrudge him that. He visited briefly and left a beautiful mark. He might not do what I like any more, but he's all class."
2,Too big,"Ordered this bracket for a Culligan HF360. The flanges are too wide which prevents the filter housing from mating tightly with the filter body. We took a grinder to it and removed 3/32"" and now it fits without leaks."
2,The Legendary Script,"The movie has excellent setting and picturistic views of the landscape of Yunan province, but the story plot is too simple."
4,Another good read from Debbie McComber.,"If you have read some of her other books, this is pretty much the same type, but still good escape reading."
3,a predictable yet entertaining quick summer read...,"okay. so i don't give it five stars. that's because i knew what was going to happen from the moment steve moved in next door to hallie, and i was a bit annoyed when the story dragged on. however, some of hallie's dates were absolutely hysterical and i found myself rereading these encounters aloud to my husband so we both had a good laugh. unfortunately, we know that there are men out there similar to those who hallie encounters. the moral is a good one. you'll have to kiss a lot of toads before you find your prince... don't settle... hold out for mr. right."
3,quality is going down...,"I think giving this CD a 3 star is pushing it.I dont understand as to why this band insists on putting out albums back to back so quickly. The result is evident in the quality of work that is portrait on this album. There are only about three decent songs on this album, my favorite being ""addict"" that is pure De/Vision like we know it....the other bigger half of the album is very experimental and has little variation in sound scape use. The lyrics are dull and just too childish.This is voted as one of De/Visions weakest releases so far."
4,Great value for quality enameled cast iron!,"This is a quality casserole! Although I have used it only once (I don't cook every day), I am quite pleased with it. It is well made and heavy; the lid fits well; the pan heats beautifully; the spaghetti sauce I made in it tasted terrific. I gave it a 4-star rating because of the color. I like brown, but this pan isn't very pretty---kind of looks like mud. However, the reason I chose this color is that it was the cheapest of all the available colors on Amazon, and I was more interested in price than in aesthetics. I also wish the casserole were a half-quart or a quart larger, but I ordered it knowing what I was getting. Overall, it was an excellent purchase, and I would recommend this item highly."
2,it's no le creuset!,I thought this casserole would hold up better than it did. It chipped and stained very easily. Difficult to clean. After a year of use (once weekly) I had to toss it. The interior finish totally wore off.
1,applique guilt patterns,My review is very simple. If you dont let us review the books on line why would I purchase one. I cant review something that does not give any kind of samples or pictures of the products and procedures in the books. I am very disappointed in this web site.
3,suffice,It is suffice for carrying around. It has a clip and a difficult belt clip that is a strap velcroed back onto itself. Would do better with a committed belt loop.
2,"Nice case, bad plastic cover","I was more than a little disappointed with this product. The case fit nicely over my GPS60CSx, but the plastic had a lot of glare to it, which made the LCD even harder to see in low light. The plastic also had some imperfections, which made it even harder to see. The neoprene case and carabener (sp?) were nice, but the plastic just ruined the usefulness.I just ordered the Invisable Shield for the 60CSx, and will probably cut the plastic out the case, and use the Invisible Shield protective cover. It's not worth the hassle to return. Almost a good product, but it's no good if you can't see the display!Bill"
4,Tricky to use,This is just as cute as it can be and made up part of a cute centerpiece but it was hard to get the lamb out. The neck broke but we just fixed it with toothpicks!
3,Did not work for me,"Made a great cake. Not a good 3D cake. You really have to use your best judgement as to how much batter to put into it. I did not put enough, so we had a 2D cake for easter LOL."
5,Lamb Cake Mold,"This item more than met my expectations. It is ideal for Easter, but can also be used at other times."
2,Noisy,"Okay, live and learn. It vibrated, making noise, and we were using it for a 5 gallon aquarium to run a sponge filter. It was too underpowered for the job. I changed out the tubing to silicone, still the same issue."
3,Good pump,Got this a small project and it did work well for a while and over just a month it began to fail i have had similar ones in the past that lasted years maybe i just got a bad one
3,whisper airpump,"Noisy mother f...Normally the noise is not so bad, but I have to turn it off at night or it will drive me insane."
5,Super quiet!,"Stylish, quiet and vibration free. Also delivers the air as promised. Not sure how long these last, but this one seems to be built pretty well by all indications."
4,Hydrauic Control Systems,Great to see a good book on Hydraulics after a long time.The books presents an easy way to understand the theory behind the Hydraulic Control systems with attractive diagrams.This book can be used by students and engineers practising in the field of Hydraulics and Control Systems.
2,Home Dynamix Zone Ebony Rug,"Not a good quality rug, very thin and has no comfort to it. The colors were a little off, not as it look in the picture."
3,Okay,Half of the tabs came broken but I was still able to use most of them in our automatic pool chlorinator.
4,Good quality,Good supplier and Good product. Got it on time (fedex) and the price was right. Will reoder soon. Was cheaper than buying it locally. Makes a big difference when used regulary in the Pool. Its brittle and make sure you don't drop it as it can crumble.
3,Far from his Best,"I'm a big fan of Doc Ford, but this installment made me realize that he has his down days (and books). It took White 2/3 of the book to really get cranking and then it seemed like he was making up for lost time. Jackie Merlot was so despicable that it wasn't a question of ""Will he die?"" but ""How?"" I forgave the credibility-stretched ending because I was glad to at least resolve some of the loose strings.Randy Wayne White has been compared favorably to John D. MacDonald (and deserves to be) but the plot for ""Mangrove Coast"" treads a little TOO close to a former Travis McGee novel, ""The Deep Blue Empty."" Both novels had a way of meandering along slowly to a final, violent conclusion.I noticed that one of the reviews for this book's follow-up, ""Shark River,"" accused it of being too action-packed. I would imagine that the readers' reactions to this book are the reason why.Keep up the GOOD work, Mr. White!"
2,Sanibel good crazy South American caper bad,"I liked Doc but it got a little far fetched in the finale. Blown up, patched up and living out life in a secret but extremly wealthy and disfigured secret society. Come on. If Mom and Pop (believed dead for decdes) could survive why not the daughter. She could have provided legal advice or whatever, I forget what her profession was, to the secret society. Maybe she could have been a plastic surgeon to the secret society"
5,A Mystery To Fall In Love With!,"THE MANGROVE COAST is the sixth of Randy Wayne White's Doc Ford series and it is the fastest, most compelling and most intense book in this absolutely wonderful series about a Florida marine biologist and his hipster friend Tomlinson. But if you are a woman be warned in advance: This book is going to scare the h--- out of you and you'll never feel the same about meeting new Internet friends again. (Frankly, it may be for the best). Many have said this before me: If you like John D. McDonald's Travis McGee, you will absolutely love Doc Ford. Ford is just as big and loveable, but he has more layers and seems even more dangerous.SJM"
1,Don't read this installment first!,"It's a good thing for me that this wasn't my first Doc Ford novel. It surely would be my last. The plot took forever to take off and by the time it did, I pretty much didn't care about the book anymore. This book is like a string of musings strung loosely with a plot line. It's notes shoved into a binding in order to thicken up a short story. I'm a big fan of Mr. White and the series but this book is not worth the effort. Skip this one and move on to Ten Thousand Islands."
2,"Princes of Ireland, Planters of Maryland: A Carroll Saga","This is historical novel for historians. It's as long and boring as its title. Not for the casual reader interested in Charles Carroll. It refers to letters and correspondence of Carroll like a term paper or research paper. I'm a descendant of Charles Carroll and I have more interest in him than most but this needs to be fleshed out to make it more readable. It's not for E books, you'll be bored out of your mind."
5,Good for the money,This protoboard is good for the money. Mine came without any problems what so ever and it just looks so much nicer compard to what im used to using. Recommend.
3,Not terribly helpful,"I wish that this book did what it said - reconnected the root system of African civilization. This book is in the same vein as Cheik Anta Diop's African Origins of Civilization, but unfortunately she seems more interested in rehashing the same arguments and counters from the 1960s and '70s than she is in writing a concise, African-centered history of Kush and Nubia. I guess I'll have to keep looking..."
3,A sincere attempt,"Spend too much time arguing on points that could be dealt with, in more of a efficient manner.An attempt use Dr.Diop's model but not enough punch to pull it off,in short good for high school and college level, but light weight for those of us at the in-depth afro-centric level,yet an sincere attempt to uncover more on the lineage of wise African women of East Africa."
5,CUTE!!,Very cute. I purchased this for my Granddaughter for Christmas because she loves pink pigs. I can't wait to see her face when she opens it.
4,INVICTA GRAND DIVER FIRST EDITION,"IS GOOD DAYTIME WATCH-EASY TO READ AND SET BUT CHARGE UP DOESNT LAST LONG ENUFF. ALSO WOULD EXPECT BETTER CLASP ON DIVER BAND, THE KIND WITH BUTTONS ON THE SIDES THAT NEED USE BEFORE OPENING FULL CLASP.ALL GOOD DIVE WATCHES HAVE THIS FEATURE.GOT YELLOW FACE WITH BLACK BEZEL AT 149 BUT RILLY WANTED THE WHITE ORIGINAL OR GREEN WITH BLACK BEZEL SAME PRICE.IS COMPETENT, EZ TO READ AND SET, AND GETS SOME NOTICE TOO.OVERALL, OK."
4,Finally! A peak on the personal daily diary of a rounder!,"I agree with the other reviewers that this book is for poker players only! The author uses lots of poker terms and jargon that is familiar mostly to poker players. And it's hard for a non-""rounder"" to understand what's truly going on in the authors mind.adrenaline, excitement, bluffs, and that one critical decision that separates winners from losers! Personally, as a poker player, I enjoyed the book all the way to the end, got my adrenaline pumped up several times from just reading some of the action and decision making in the story.Like I said, this book can be really entertaining if you are a rounder, however, the storyline lacks a progressive organized story plot, not terribly bad for a person who doesn't write for a living but the story and character development could've used some refining. It's more of a personal daily diary than a true novel...just keep that in mind while reading the book and you'll enjoy it."
4,For HIGHLANDER fans only,"This is a tie-in novel to the HIGHLANDER movies and TV series, featuring both Connor and Duncan MacLeod.The villian Immortal here is Khordas, an incredibly old Immortal, whose first lifetime was in a prehistoric village where he was worshipped as a god. He is mentally unstable but has managed to survive long enough to cross paths with the MacLeods. Their final conflict with him occurs in the late 1800's. Along the way we meet no less than three female Immortals.This is definitely for HIGHLANDER fans only, anyone else would not be able to make sense of this story. For HIGHLANDER fans it is a good adventure, well written and with an interesting, well developed 'bad guy'. Also the settings are well described, showing some less well known times and places. For fans there is the additional treat of three female Immortals."
4,"Slow start, but fascinating","This book works extremely well if you're a fan of both the original movie and the TV series, as it provides answers to the question of when, precisely, did Duncan and Connor meet and other details about their friendship. The evil Immortal plot is really secondary to that detail, and weak in comparison until the middle third of the book. The writer doesn't give enough detail to developing Khordas as a horrific character until then, and by then, you've decided whether or not to continue with the book. It's worth it, though."
4,The Bond Between The Clansmen,"The story's quite nice though it would have been better if they has more action and plot in it. Overall, the whole story has Duncanand Connor as the main characters and Icouldn't quite put down the book when I startedreading it. Keep up with the bond between theteacher and the student!!! Excellent!!!!!!!!!"
5,Complements over complements!!!,"I love 5th avenue, I bought this perfume just by an accident. The first day I wore it, I got the compliment as I walked into the office. I am a nurse, and so many people asked me what I wear, they just sniff over my shoulders and they just love the way I smell. You will love it because it makes you smells good, feel sexy, and just so classy. I bought philosophy brand perfumes because they smell so clean, but as you know they last until you stop spraying on you. lol. seriously. But, this perfume as never overpowering as it is, it last on your body all day long. I love it so much, and I would recommend it to just about any woman who wants to smell beautiful and feel sexy without heavy punch on your nose!"
2,I don;t think so,Pretty lousy design-does not look like it is described here-I returned it-the blue version is much better looking
5,A Must For View Askew Fans,"Really gives you a better idea about Jay and his hetero lifemate, Silent Bob. Porn stars, The Fugitive and even Mr. Rogers make appearances. This series of comic books (four issues in this book) gives you the lowdown of J&SBs adventures from their scene in the Diner in ""Chasing Amy"" up until their grand appearance in ""Dogma."" Well drawn and exceptional stories make this a must for View Askew fanboys. Wanna know more about Suzanne, the monkey at the end of Mallrats? Wanna know how Jay and Silent Bob made it to Illinois? Wanna know what happened to Trish the Dish after Mallrats? All is explained right here. If you enjoy this book, also check out Clerks: The Comics by Kev Smith too."
2,Beautiful but does not stand normal wear and tear !,"The color is gorgeous, but this tie does not stand a one week rotation as normal wear and tear for 2 months....I am not satisfied with the product........"
3,gets out the particles,Use enclosed fireplace. During startup some smoke gets into room. I can smell the smoke. Put the filter on and I can't smell the smoke .
1,CAUTION: DO NOT BUY!,"I bought these screen covers, expecting something that would held protect my PSP. Boy, was that a waste of ten dollars. These protectors are GARBAGE. Even after following every step, there are still pesky air bubbles EVERYWHERE! Also, once you try, there are marks all over your PSP, making it dirtier than it probably was before. DO NOT BUY!"
1,this stinks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I bought this at best buy when I bought my psp (actually I had to buy the bundle so they made me buy this). After I saw how delicate the screen was I decided to open the thing and to my surprise I sow the screen protector was the bended! all what you get in this is a peice of cloth and 1 peice of thin plastic!!!! this is a ripofff!!!! dont buy this!
1,Be careful,"I just bought the same screen protectors earlier today and within an hour I took them off. They mess with your screen's clarity too much to really show off your psp's true potential. You CAN get the air bubbles out, but not only does that take quite some time, but the outcome isn't all it's worked up to be. No matter what, in the end you'll end up with a grainy picture almost unfit for playing with. I am not in any way trying to criticize pelican as most of their products have been quite good to me, but this is honestly not a good buy. Save your money and get something a little fancier, you won't regret it : ]."
3,I like the other ones in the series more,"If you don't already own left brain and right brain, I would recommend getting those first. Though, this one is meant for older children, but it is not quite as entertaining it seems. My child doesn't seem to respond to this one as much as the left and right brain DVDs. If you already own left and right brain, it is still a worthwhile purchase."
5,mom of two little ones,"TRULY AMAZING!! Got this for my son's second birthday. Didn't know if he would go for it because there's no caterpillar at the beginning (he's a loyal Baby Einstein fan), but it has become his favorite video. Honestly, within one week he learned all his letters, uppercase and lower. He now sings the ABC song as cute and as well as a two year old can. This combined with Leap Frog's refrigerator magnets have really helped him with his letters. I highly, highly recommend this video. Our six month old enjoys it, too. We're waiting for her to start singing her ABC's too!"
4,Great quality for the price,"I loved the celtic knot design on this, and the gray is subtle yet noticeable. The strap holes are made in thick material, so once it is on the guitar, there is no question that it will stay on. I have a guitar case that fits my guitar tightly, so the strap has to come off every time I put the guitar in the case. This strap, while durable enough to give peace of mind, is a little too stiff for my liking. I'm sure with extensive use, it will be more flexible. Overall, though, it's a well-made product, especially for the price."
3,Pump works but needs extra parts,"Not all parts are included to replace an existing pump. Used the old parts to complete the installation. Kind of scary tightening the joints, didn't want to jeopardize or crack the fittings, so there are some minor leaks, which I hope will reduce once the calcium deposits set in. Too much plastic fittings. But, it is working so far."
5,Great Dog Food Supplement,"I have an 8-year old West Highland Terrier that I recently adopted. She only eats her dry dog food with Little Cesar's wet food mixed in. The wet food is $1.00/day, so it's getting very expensive. I thought I would try these because my previous dog (who passed away) loved it. It's working really well and I'm slowly weaning her off of it. I'm on the last can of Little Cesar's. I'm glad I ordered a full case of this sauce. :)"
2,Not for mine,"Have 2 Shelties..good eaters but at times a little picky on their dry kibble..thought this might spark it up a little...wrong..they don't like the smell or taste..tried it on our 3 cats (they eat anything)..not for them either..I tasted it (hey, if they can eat it I should be able to at least taste it)..not for me either...8 unopened bottles going somewhere......."
1,I guess I'm just not as good as them,"Portly Ustinov appears at the home of fatso singer Pavarotti for some witty banter among the two fat slobs. As you might imagine, Pavarotti is not living in a men's shelter with Wonder bread bags for shoes. He's also not living in a one bedroom house in Encino with cinderblock walls around the backyard and a large tan-colored retriever with a skin problem and a habit of incessant barking. WHat I'm saying is he's doing plenty all right for himself and he doesn't mind if you, the viewer, find out about that. I guess belting out opera pays a lot better than what I'm doing for a living. I guess I don't deserve to be rich and famous with witty jet-set friends to hobnob with. I guess the four-dollar-a-bottle merlot I get at Trader Joes is about all I deserve."
5,Flat-Out The best VB beginner book ever!,I wanted to learn vb and it was my first programming language and I had it recommended to me. Within a week I was making rather useful VB applications that I was proud of. This should be your first book of VB programming.
3,Interesting only for older - say >3 yrs?,My 7 mo old son who watches the other <=1 year Brainy Baby DVDs just isn't into this one past the Ol'MacDonald song montage. Then it's really a video for older children.
1,Do NOT waste your money. Get Baby Einstein,"1st, if you are INSISTANT that this is the video you want, go to Toys R Us. They are $6.00.I usually only get Baby Einstein, but thought I'd try the Brainy Baby videos. They will soon be coasters. I was SO disappointed with the quality of them! They are soooo disjointed and ""messy"". My daughter LOVES the Baby Einstien movies but I thought I'd try these hoping maybe they were as calm and fun with the same amount of music. WOW. Not even close. They are like a wild kids party. Not really where I want my daughter playing. She lost interest in the 1st two minutes anyway. The music is actually a little painful to listen to. The costume animals, one's a teddy, not too bad, the other a dinosaur with hip-hop body language. A litte Barny-ish.Needless to say, I'm going back to Baby Einstein. No question about it."
2,Poor me,I can't remember reading a more self serving narcissistic bio from a journalist. I learned nothing from this book/journal.
1,Don't Waste Your Time,"This book was NOT based on spiritual insight and I felt it was a total waste of my time. He tried to introduce the story as a parable but didn't quite go over because it is pure speculation on his part. There are no biblical facts to corroborate his imagination. If indeed it was a parable, he should have used other characters and names to get his point across. And, he didn't answer any of the questions posed at the beginning of the book. Very disappointed that I purchased this book."
3,Nice catalog ;-),"I'm glad I checked the contents of this book. Otherwise I would have been mighty surprised to find that half of it is a guitar catalog. If that's what you're loking for then buy it. You'll get half a good book about the IMPORTANT stuff you should know along with your catalog. This is not a 600 page book about how to play, how to maintain, repair... your guitar. Otherwise it's fine. I like Tony Bacon's books - I have many of them."
5,Totally Guitar - The name of this book says it all!!,"This book is impeccably well illustrated to say the least!! Whether you own and play a guitar, own guitars for art or collect them, this book is a MUST HAVE for anyone who appreciates guitars!! This book covers ALL guitar manufacturers and everything that you could ever want to know about guitars!! Totally Guitar makes a GREAT coffee table book at 608 pages in length and is a good sized book!!! I have added five photos that I took of this book, so checkout my photos that I have shared above. If you buy this book, you will NOT be disappointed whatsoever as it is WELL worth the money!! Get it, you know you want it!!!"
3,Great book for a beginner,"although the the title of the book looks enticing, this book does not really give a very deep and enciteful view into HOW to develop software properly. It misses on some key components such as expanding in its concepts of iterative and OO development and requires you to have prior knowledge to the material. While the book is very easy to read and gives an overview, I wouldn't suggest this book if you are looking for a more through examination on software development."
3,"Out of date, out of synch","Besides being out of date, even for internal software dev groups, the contents of this book are plain out of synch with practices in any SW development environment.The author wanders through people, process and technology with no clear purpose as far as I can tell, and the technology section is so outdated that it comes across as quaint.Even the people and process sections are weak. Use the P-CMM to handle people issues, and pick any number of process approaches, from agile methods and extreme programming at one end, to the CMM at the other."
3,a little disappointed,"The book was great and in good condition, I was disappouinted to find that the model kit was missing from the book. I ordered it for my 7 year old and the model set is why she choose the book. Although she did enjoy the graphics and details of the book, she was sad the model set was missing. The book came in a very timely manner and we always have great luck ordering used books through Amazon. I guess this was a small set back and we will continue to place orders through Amazon because we are, as a general rule, very pleased with the books we order.Dragonology Tracking and Taming Dragons Volume 1: A Deluxe Book and Model Set: European Dragon (Ologies)"
2,Milking a good idea a bit too far,"The ""ology"" series started out as very fun and unique publications. This particular book and model set has little to offer comparatively. Rather disappointing..."
5,"Clear, easy to use, and very helpful!","I really enjoyed practicing with this book. They have a very clear method of writing which makes it seem like a one-on-one extra help session with your favorite teacher. Ever since I started, practice exams at school have become easier to manage and I am looking forward to a good score on the AP exam in May. I know there are hundreds of exam books on the market, but I would recommend this one to anyone who is reviewing for this test."
1,what?,"this novel is NOT good. I think the people on here (most of them choosing the ""name"" ""Customer"" are freinds of the author or something. More southern ridiculousness. Eccentricity has become just another convention, another formula. This author has read Confederacy of Dunces too many times, and it shows. Sorry."
4,"Insightful, mellow book with great characters","The book has wonderful, interesting characters, and makes the rare observation that all people in the south and/or in trailer parks are not, in fact, stupid. The only reason that I don't give it 5 stars is that the plot is a bit thin, but the characters more than make up for that deficiency. Excellent read."
2,"Good writing, but I couldn't even finish the book","While Martin Clark is a good writer, I couldn't even find the will to finish this book. The characters were completely unsympathetic, and I couldn't relate to any of them. The story didn't grab me, and I pushed myself to read through the half way point and then finally gave up.This is not a book I'd recommend to anyone. Not because of poor writing, but because the story wasn't interesting, and the characters were two dimensional. I didn't believe for one minute that any of the events would have occured in real life, and that made it hard to read also.Pass on this one, there are other great books out there to read!"
1,Don't Buy this Product!!!,"This is the most innacurate thermometer I have ever come across. Each reading seems to increase or drop by 1 degree or more. Moreover, the battery only lasts for 1-2 uses. Granted, one needs to take 10 readings to get a general idea of the correct temperature, but you would think the battery could last a few more times. When you have a sick child, accuracy and time are of the essence."
5,Incredible Research tool,"I was interested in this book for two reasons, one, I know the author, and two, I knew my daughter would find this as a great reference for her future studies and projects in high school.Its full of information on just about anything you could want to research in every catagory across the globe, I would strongly recommend this book to anyone in high school or college, for doing any type of report, thesis or just for basic reference material.You can tell the author (Jeff Lenburg) really put a lot of time and work into this book. I feel it should be a common reference material on any high school or college library shelf. It would also be beneficial for professors or teachers of any grade level."
1,Just awful,"I read Witchcraft from Jayne Ann Krentz. Normally, I kind of like her books - nothing fantastic just a good, fun read in the trashy book catagory. I have to wonder if she had a sixth grade class ghost write this book! It was the worst scene setting and dialog I have ever encountered. I have never bothered to write a review before but this was so bad I had to warn people not to spend money on this. If you really think you want to check it out go to the library. My copy will be there."
3,"Enjoyable read, but frustrating","If you are a big Jayne Ann Krentz fan, which I am, you will appreciate the alpha male in this book. However, I was disappointed in the heorine's back and forth emotions. One minute she's in love with him, the next she hates him..etc.etc. I think she forgives him way too easily too many times, but overall it was an easy read. Not her usual standards, but not a total loss."
4,WCW Super Brawl 1993: Windham wins NWA World Title,Perhaps the most underrated moment in wrestling in the last 25 years: Barry Windham wins the NWA World Heavyweight Championship...need we say more?Also a very choice pre superstardom Chris Benoit v. 2 Cold Scorpio match is there as two bust their butts in an opening match that shows exactly why these guys were so good.
5,love it!,"This model is perfect for my ferret. I love it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!My ferret is very happy with this, I hope the provider sale other color"
4,A somewhat interesting book.,A review of psychoactive options available for those who want to get high legally - good luck with that. For more information read the book. Or not.
2,Balky Battery Drawer,"This alarm has a battery drawer that slides out. I ordered two of these alarms. On one, the drawer slides in and out as it should. On the other, the drawer slides in, but won't easily slide out. On both alarms, the drawers are somewhat flimsy, and the sliding is not precise. I would not recommend this alarm for that reason."
5,Requested and enjoyed!,"My grandsons have Game Cube and Wii systems they enjoy and requested this, out of the blue. They really enjoy this fun game that takes them through the adventures and lets them enjoy playing the roles."
5,Very logical! Very Easy!,"I have taught Algebra and Algebra II to high school and middle school students now for five years. Many teachers I know have simply skipped many of the word problems because they are too difficult to teach. That practice has never set well with me, yet I have not been able to do better at teaching this difficult subject. My own difficulty in explaining the procedure stems from the fact that Algebra comes so easily to me. I sometimes unknowingly skip steps, or I will solve a similar problem in a different manner because I see a shortcut.I bought this book last year, hoping that I can find a systematic way of explaining how to solve common algebraic word problems. What this book has enabled me to do is put a consistent, algorithmic, logical structure to common problems in Algebra. Many, many more of my students have been able to tackle word problems successfully.I was so impressed with this book that I shared it with colleagues who have now embraced it with enthusiasm."
5,Hardly an Idiot's Manual,"This book is for people who look to become accomplished pool players, not just regular shot-makers. From equipment selection to table manners and to the actual mechanics of shot making and practicing, this is one compact reference that packs a solid punch. The extensive treatment of basic concepts can immediately jumpstart the beginner's game, if not make him sound like a pool sage (if he plays as good as he speaks). This is hardly an idiot's manual. On the contrary, this is a thinking player's reference, a beginner's bible and a proficient player's ""chicken soup"" if his game has gone south!"
4,"Movie buffs, old timers, and foxy people only!","I found this an extremely interesting documentary on The Studio, (as it was known before it's slew of Drew Barrymore vehicles, where she plays a virgin... again.) It was also fairly entertaining. The DVD, however, is recommended, in my humble opinion, to only those who are self-acknowledged movie buffs, or were alive at the time of Fox's first 50 years, or who are just FOX-y people. This is not recommended for the casual viewer, but for the viewer with the specific requirements mentioned. On the plus side, there are many insights into both The Studio and early film-making in general, and also featured are dailies from various Marilyn Monroe films of her 'goofing up' during her more traumatic years."
1,Disappointing,I was very disappointed to find only black & white drawings of the insects.....a key part to identifying is color. I returned it for a refund.
3,*Boring*,"I played this game before, and do not buy it, it's just plain BORING. All it is? Fighting. That's ALL!!!! Believe me, this is not the best game you'll ever see."
3,"Incredibly late shipping, un-oiled leather","This bracer looks nice, and it seems to be made of leather that will stand up for a while. But a huge problem is, the product is supposedly ""hand made to order"", or at least that was the reason I was given when I asked why it hadn't shipped after three weeks. It arrived almost a month after I ordered it, a few weeks after the estimated arrival date. Another issue I took with it was the fact that it came dry and un-oiled. I have a lot of experience using, cleaning, and caring for quality leather products from my competitive horseback riding days, and for 40 bucks, this product should come well oiled and ready for use, considering how few materials are actually used in making it. That's what brings down the rating for me: poor shipping and poor treatment of the leather. Other than that, it fits well, it seems to be durable, and frankly it's pretty."
4,A good DVD-RW for the money.,"I bought this unit two weeks ago which is a internal DVD-RW Model 1633S and came with Nero operating software. It and the software loaded up perfectly with the computer (PC Windows XP), reconizing the hardware and assigning a windows ROM drive engine to it. My gripe is the DVD will not drag and drop, send to or write on a CD-RW,CD-R or CD-ROM. I have contacted the tech-support for this DVD writer but have not been able to solve the problem. I am wondering if I have gotten a bad DVD writer... I have backed up some of my DVD movies and they come out perfectly, you can't tell them from the original ones. I am waiting for another email reply to my problem from tech-support, hope they have an answer."
5,Best mouse ever.,"I love this mouse. It's the same one I have at work and it's worked flawlessly for 3 years. No problem with the laser, no problems with the buttons and it seems to work on any surface. It's simple in design and very effective."
2,slip sliding away,"The pedal does what it's supposed to do, and as long as you tape it to the floor, it won't move. Otherwise, I'm constantly having to grab and reposition it with my foot."
4,Works great,This pedal works great for my daughter who is just beginning to play. My only issue is that the pedal is a bit on the small side. I think someone with a larger foot might want to think about a bigger pedal.
3,Color more red than picture,"The color of the oil rubbed bronze is not what it appears in the photo. It is much more red, not the dark brown pictured. We are going to have to return them because they don't match our other oil rubbed bronze hardware. We are really disappointed because the quality seems great. The style is exactly what we wanted, but the color is just wrong."
4,A PUZZLE FOR YOUNG READERS,"Husband/wife teams often come up with the best ideas, and such is the case with this book for young readers. Marian Harris has penned a mini-mystery for children, while Jim Harris illustrates it with deft brush strokes enabling livestock to take on personalities and endearing expressions.The question is who is sneaking into goose's nest and purloining her eggs? We know what friends are for which is why all the barnyard animals rally around to help goose solve the mystery.Young readers will enjoy watching the steps that are taken to find the culprit."
1,"Not good, not worth it!","As with the other reviewer, I thought this game would have some educational value. I haven't found it yet and I can't believe I spent $25 for this! It's boring and you play the same thing over and over again!"
5,Awesume HORROR SCORE!!!,"It all began in 1980 with the remarkable legend Harry Manfredini, as he came up with the phenomenal Jason vocal effect KI KI KI MA MA MA, that made Friday The 13th so amazing as it is.Throughout the score in this soundtrack, you will hear alot of KI KI KI MA MA MA, and most of the music is exactly what you hear from the movie!!!The best part of this soundtrack is track no.2 (The Main Titles), not only a good horror score for the film, but also there is a rythmatic sound that goes with the KI KI MA MA which makes it really effective!!!5 stars for me!!!!"
3,Jason Goes to Hell,"Well if you have seen JGTH then the audio in the movie is the exacty same thing on the disc excluding the vocals and sound effects. The only vocal used is the ki-ki-ki-ma-ma-ma, which is used alot on the cd. A little of the original Friday the 13th is put into the music(probably the best part with the ki-ki-ki score). The music tends to be very cheesy in almost every track. Almost every track sounds exactly the same and gets repetetive."
3,Horses for Courses,"This book is very easy to follow and simply covers the steps to selling in great detail, with good illustrations. This is an excellent book for anyone who is uneasy with technology and wants to sell on eBay. I think ebay for dummies does a better and more rounded job though.If you have any experience with eBay, or are looking for something that will help you maximize your returns, this book will be of no value (eBay secrets is a great alternative, how to do everything with an eBay Busibess is also good).I can see why this book has extremes of reviews, I didn't find it helpful. I borrowed it and I am glad I didn't pay for it. That said, I work with computers day in day out. Great book for people who don't."
5,Please buy the new edition of this book instead!,"I'm one of the authors of this book and just want to encourage anyone who's considering it to buy the new, second edition instead! It came out in November 2005 and covers all the latest eBay selling developments. It's much more up to date than this edition.If you'd like to search for it here on Amazon, its ISBN/catalog number is 0321356802.Thanks and happy selling!"
3,it will do,I had ordered this to use for a sookie costume (from true blood) I didn't have the time to wait for the one with the actual logo on it so I found this which was far more cost effective to make my own. Now we have it on display in the window of our store.
5,Very good book on the subject,"It's not Vegan; it doesn't claim to be. But, most of the recipes can be made Vegan by substituting some ingredients.That said, the recipes seem to be very nice, and interesting."
1,Don't waste your $$,This product was suppose to stimulate but did nothing but annoy. Don't waste your money. Pretty lingerie would've been money ahead.
2,Cooks great but a pain to clean,I had one of these and loved the way it cooked roasts but the clean up was so bad that I finally threw it out...the food just wouldn't come off when cleaning no matter what I did and that hole was impossible to clean...mold would grow on it when it wasn't used because it just would not come clean.
4,Roast Chicken!,I only used it once & I roasted a chicken. It wasn't even a good Perdue chicken. But it came out good! It was almost 4 lbs & I put it on for a bit over 1 hr (too lazy to come back & check time). I'm only 1 person. I look forward to trying other meals. I was also glad to see the fat that came off. (between 3-4 stars for now).
2,Disappointing,"I am afraid that my expectations for this device were too high. Although the Contact Cooker is small and easy to clean, it certainly does not cook a very good chicken. Although I let a three pound, seven ounce chicken cook for nearly seventy-five minutes, the extrior was not browned nor crisp but was pale, not deeply colored and the skin seemed slimy and unpleasant on the palate. The internal temperature of the chicken was a more than adequate 175 degrees (and, even at that level, the meat, admittedly, was still moist, though not particularly flavorful). The cookbook provided with the Contact Cooker is scanty on recipes and makes me suspect that the capabilities of this machine are very, very limited. I am hoping that I shall have better luck with a beef or pork roast, but I fear that this product is a loser."
2,Potential Yet To Be Realized,"This was a frustrating read. Egan's prose is killer, but the plot and the characters wore thin very quickly. I finished the book out of obligation, not joy."
2,ok,"Egan's book is chock-full of interesting ideas, but it was too long by about half to support her thin and rather fantastical plot. I found the characters interesting in themselves, but their interactions with each other were all so contrived that I had difficulty suspending disbelief.This book is interesting in the way it missed some of its own stride because of September 11th (in my edition, the author has added a thoughtful note on this point). In several ways, Egan was clairvoyant about the immediate future of personal politics, internet culture, and contemporary malaise. Worth dipping into, if somewhat flawed."
3,Literary and Psychological,"This book was not a page turner, I found myself pushing my way through parts of the novel that were far more literary than a simple fast-moving narrative. Ultimately, it was mostly worth it. You never quite get in the shoes of the narrator, you never quite understand her, and you're never sure whether you're supposed to be rooting for her. Perhaps that's is the point. There are things she does that you want to hate her for, yet to follow along in mind quite different from my own is an experience that has its own rewards"
1,Glad I just borrowed if from the library,"This book started off interesting and I thought I was going to enjoy it. However, it quickly became bizarre, the plot extremely odd (a promising gorgeous boy that becomes insane in the grip of the Industrical Revolution? please), and it was impossible to warm up to the characters. Obviously a talented, educated and literate writer, I hope her next novel lives up to her talent."
2,Too many things happening all at once,"This book was not at all as I expected. I enjoyed parts of it, but there was just too much going on. Too many people were brought into the story. I would have rather seen fewer characters with more indepth development on fewer story lines."
3,It's not great but...2.5-3ish,"Alright, so it's a low budget horror movie, but it's NOT awful. It's NOT The Hills Have Eyes or anything. It's got gore, it's got death, it's got inbred type hicks in the woods chasing city kids and scaring the heck outta them. It drags on at some points but it has MORE than just a couple kills, as the other reviewer said. There's decapitation, and more, not to spoil it too much. It's not so low budget that the camera shakes and the acting is completely TERRIBLE, it's just not your high end type of theater movie. If you can pick it up CHEAP, like 5.00 or under, it's worth a watch if you're a TRUE slasher film fan."
4,Verrry Funny specials you don't see in repeats,"I ordered this just to see the QE2 episode my parents had talked so much about. These special episodes are seldom rerun and if you're a fan, you must see them."
1,"Boring, but let's you know what you are getting into","This video was very very boring. We purchased it because we were going on holiday to Australia, and taking the Queenslander.We had an incredible trip, and loved our ride on the train while we were there.The video did give us a little idea of what the train journey would be like, but was just too boring to watch more than once.If you like trains, I wouldn't recommend this either, because there wasn't much information about the train itself or it's history."
2,can you run that by me again?,"It blows my mind that a tour on such a large scale could be reduced to a mere 12 track compilation, less than the other two past Family Values Tour albums. This tour and these bands deserve much more than this, and I was seriously hoping this year would be the first double-disc Family Values Tour album. As far as I can see, the best songs the bands played on the tour weren't released as part of this album, but definitely should have been. STP's live performance of ""Sex Type Thing"" is insanely destructive and beautiful at the same time. Linkin Park's ""Pushing Me Away"" as well as ""In The End"" brought tears to my eyes during the show, and what about Staind's ""Pressure"" or ""Suffer?"" If you've seen them do it live, you know what I'm talking about. I guess I can say if you missed the show, this album is okay, but if you were there, you might be pretty disappointed."
3,Algae-Off 2 lbs,It kind of worked did not kill the algae off as fast as I expected took over a day and did not get it all and that is with direct contact
2,More of an attack on Reformed Theology than anything else.,"This book is basically an attack on Reformation Theology. Its presuppositions and themes are decidedly anti-Calvinistic while trying to appear as just pious Celtic spirituality. There's an obvious agenda, to be sure.I was expecting to Listen for the Heartbeat of God, but what I heard is that Pelagius (the misunderstood heretic) was right and Augustine was wrong. The book is clearly too simplistic and doesn't do any justice to the Augustine and Pelagian controversy. Either Newell is actually characterizing Celtic spirituality for what it is, or worse, he his imposing his own Pelagian paradigm under the guise of ""Celtic"" spirituality. Thus, either he's right and I don't like it, or he's just got an agenda--and I still don't like it."
5,Another excellent Highlander story,"I really enjoyed this addition to the Highlander legend, particularly as it expanded on an intriguing flashback from the TV series -- when Duncan knew Hamza el Kahir in the 1600's in Algeria.For martial arts fans, the info about fighting styles (particularly scimitar vs other swords) is very interesting."
4,classic,If you are a fan of punk/ska this is a must have classic album. It has some classic songs. These guys are pioneers of the 90's punk sound. BUY THIS ALBUM NOW!
1,What God told me to tell you,It is hard to believe that people really believe this. The Bible does say that Satan disguises himself as an angel of light.
3,Ace Frehley Rocks.,"Mainly purchased this film a/c Ace Frehley's involvement.Would'nt say it is a feel good movie, but it was enjoyable to watch. It certainly isn't a shocker.For the KISS fans out there, it is great to see Ace again!!!"
1,Dark Age of Camelot,It requires an insane amount of time to reach level 50. Once (if ever) you're 50 you will realize that there's no high level game and you'll have been nerfed repeatedly on the way. Your newly nerfed 50 you've devoted so much time to will not resemble the class you started with all.Some fun can be had in the level 24 battlegrounds. But after a few days of fun you'll reach your point limit there and be kicked back out into the meaningless hamster wheel of leveling to 50.
2,Only get this game if you are extremely bored and love RPGs,"This game is extremely boring. The graphics arent really that great, there are practically no sounds, all you do is hit things with weapons and get their stuff and do it over again, I get no fun out of it whatsoever. This game would be nowhere without EQ(Do not think I am biased to EQ I do not play it) it basically got all its ideas from it and added a little more. To me, it is just a total EQ clone, it would have never been created without the thoughts and ideas EQ had. My advice if you dont like plain old ordinary RPG games like this one is to wait for shadowbane to come out."
5,Visually astonishing and super addictive!,"Dark Age of Camelot is a game for people who are dedicated to a single game, because in this game you have to be patient! Getting to level 50 and becoming more powerful than a locomotive does not happen in 2 days! BUT! This is not something that should stop you from buying it because it's the best MMORPG I have ever played. It takes almost 30-40 minutes to get from one side of a realm to another and has huge monsters and dungeons in your way! Look out Everquest, theres a new game in town!"
1,Doesn't Compare to Ultima Online,"After four years of Ultima Online, I was looking forward to something new. This is not it, unless all you want is player vs. player combat. without the richness of social life that is found in Ultima. Ultima is so large and varied that there is always something new to do there and continues to rise to the challenges of new games by reshaping itself. I believe that this game will be a lot of fun at first but will get old fast. Back to Ultima for me."
2,Not for the solo player!,"The graphic's are awsome and the playing is fun IF you like to group for the rest of your chracters carrier.Yes, they will say a Wizard, Sorcerer or Theurgist are good soloist but, I've been playing these 3 ""toons"" for almost 6 months and get killed 5 times (if not more) in 30 minutes everytime. (I'm fighting things that are level green, the lowest level to score anything).Nope, not for the solo player or for the person that just wants to have fun and relax after a hard days work.You will become frustrated even more. (Talk about toon-rage)."
4,Looks like Mythic got it right this time.,"Dark Age of Camelot is a solid online rpg. Amazon.com is selling it for 50% off, heck that is a good enough deal for me. Personally I wouldn't pay $40 for this game because of other titles like Everquest. But you can not beat this price. Look at it this way, you are getting three free months of gameplay. The one included, plus two more paid for by the 50% off.This game is taking us a few steps closer to a new generation of MMORPGs. And I say ""Bring it on"", plus you can't beat the price. Get it asap."
3,not quite what we were looking for,"I purchased this product for my mother who has a degenerative muscle disease that has weakened her muscles so she has problems standing. My hope was that it could be installed to act as a more stable armrest on her couch. While the product was easy to install and is very sturdy, it mounts in such a way that it is in front of the couch. It cannot be moved closer to the person who is seated (like an armrest). This requires the person to pull themselves to a standing position with the couch cane. My mom is not strong enough to do this after she has been sitting for a while. Redesigning it so that the person who is seated could push themselves up using the product would make it make more useful."
5,it's the bomb and there an't nothing u can do about it,this stuff is the best think sence sliced bread
2,For those who hated history textbooks -- This is like that.,"This is a fairly good (though pandering) account of the history of Mad Magazine. At least the part that I read was. I didn't finish the book -- didn't even come close to finishing it -- because of one big problem: It reads like a textbook. It manages to make the subject of Mad Magazine boring. The account is written in such a dry manner that I just gave up on it and went back to reading my old MAD magazines. Forget all of the back-room dealings, squabbles, personnel changes, and business decisions. The only history I find I care about is the history of the art itself."
3,The Emancipation Proclamation,"It's history. What can you say? You can't review history as it happened. You can only know that it did. It's what people write and say about it than can be reviewed. Reviewing it as a speech and later published document, one has to admit he was a great speech writer in his time. He was careful about his words and since he didn't make mistakes in his writing, he had them well thought out before he set them to paper."
3,It's ok,"Bought this after a friend suggested it. My dogs hated it at first. Still can't get one of them to wear it and it takes a lot of time a patience to get them used to it. We don't even use them anymore, it got to be a bit of a hastle. We got training leashes and they seem to be doing a much better job. The sizing.......you might want to get a size smaller than you think you should get. They do seem to run a little big. Not a bad product if you have a laid back dog."
3,"Just ok, overpriced at $95.00","As one of the previous reviewers stated it is OK, but nothing near as exceptional as the other reviewers stated. Honestly, I don't think it toasts all that good. You never know how the toast is going to come out sometimes well done sometimes not toasted at all, and this is on the same setting. Which is annoying when you have people in your household who are particular about crunchiness. I'm waiting for it to breakdown so I can justify purchasing a different toaster.Also, I got this for about $40 or $50, when they had a rebate going, I think $99 is way overpriced for this toater oven"
2,Expensive for just Toast,"Purchased about 6 months ago...worked OK in the beginning then began to get very hot on top surface when cooking for a few minutes....and also began to smell as if something was burning...now only use it for quick heat up items....I plan to junk it and get a cheaper, simpler toaster/oven."
2,not too happy,"The product worked great the first few times, but now it does not toast to dark know matter how you configure the buttons. dissapointing."
5,Couldn't be more pleased,"This Toaster Oven Rocks! How nice it is to have your toast done consistently over and over again regardless of how many times you've used it that morning. And isn't that the point, that the toaster oven cooks stuff the same way every time. As an added bonus, the light in this thing is brighter than the one in your oven. You can see your food. Clearly. What more could you ask for? Get off the fence and buy this thing... you and your toast will be happy."
4,nice little oven,"The oven is perfect for what I use a toaster oven for, which is mainly reheating leftovers.I bought it because it is square instead of rectangular and because it got such good reviews. One such review cautioned against getting burned on the door, which I found is easy to do."
4,great for toasting,This oven toast all kinds of bread great. It reheats rolls and small amounts of food. It is a to small to bake much of anything in it. If you are looking for an oven to bake in I would recommend a bigger one like the Oster.
1,Disappointment,"If you remember Suzy Homemaker ovens for kids, you'll know what to expect from this appliance. Bread toasts unevenly, if at all. It's going to the charity thrift shop, and we'll look for something else."
4,The raving reviews are true,"I just bought the toaster oven and it is just as all the reviews described. I've tried frozen breaded ckn filets and frozen toasts, everything browns evenly and cooks thoroughly with no preheating required, given that you follow the heating instructions to the letter. It really beats waiting for the big oven. It has now replaced my old 2 slice toaster.The only downside is the extreme bright light. When I read about it, I didn't think it would be a factor but it was actually quite nauseating the first few times. It comes on immediately once you set the timer so there's no avoiding seeing it. I've read FIR is used in health-enhancing applications so I wonder if this kind of exposure affects the body at all. It's uncomfortable and takes some getting used to. But overall, I can't imagine trading it for a conventional toaster oven. It performs very well."
5,Infrared Toaster Oven,"I use this appliance a lot, possibly more than I use my microwave oven. Cooking takes longer, but is just as simple. This toaster oven is a great product and a great value. It's worth it just for what it can do with individual-sized frozen pizzas, especially if you cook them directly on the rack. I've been eating healthier as well, because the oven also does a great job with those meatless burgers found in the freezer section. They get crispy. The secret's in the infrared."
4,Really Nice. We use it in our RV/Camper,"Perfectly toasted toast! We use it for toast and bagels and garlic bread and chicken nuggets and chicken wings and tater tots...When the light turns on it is so bright you could loose your eyesight...JOKING, but it needs a tinted window thats for sure."
5,Just a great toaster,"We've had this unit for three months, and I just have to add my accolades to the others here: This is just a really great toaster. Yes, the looks are a little unusual and yes, it's a little expensive. However, the thing just works--it makes great toast, just the way you want it, whether the bread is fresh or frozen (two different buttons). As far as the price goes, it's a bargain: I think we've gone through about six cheaper models in the last five years, because my wife just wants a simple unit. The other units were simple and each was cheap, but none worked right and they all failed in short order. Together, they cost a lot more than this one, which I expect will be around for years. Would I buy it again? Yes, in a minute."
3,"Good, but not great","This case is heavy duty. It's a little bulky, but it's secure. The iPod fits securely in the case's ""cradle,"" and it even comes with a suction cup for extra hold.The one BIG drawback is that there is no opening for the TouchWheel, so to access the controls, you need to flip the case open."
1,What A Piece Of Garbage,"I tried this case for my 4g 40gb iPod. When I closed it with the velcro sides it pressed my click wheel down and caused problems shutting off. I have had problems shutting off since trying this case. May be ok for the 15 or 20gb, but did not deliver the help for the 40gb I was looking for. If you need a case, the Xtremity System looks to be one of the best."
3,Keep An Open Mind And Keep Looking,"I bought this item at Target, and was very excited initially. As soon as I opened it though, I discovered its internal shell (which is lined, so as not to scratch) was too small for my 4th gen 40 gig. Im not sure what the exact dimensions are of the older model or smaller ones are, but I do know that the 20 gig 3rd gen is smaller. If it had fit my iPod i would be stoked! It has a really cool flip feature so that your iPod is totallt protected from minor bumps and scratched when closed and playing, and it has an opening for charging or updating your iPod (which I dont recomend if your uplaoding over 5 gigs at a time, the iPod tends to get warm anyway, so there is my neautral stance, but bulk and wearability are not big selling points, really it isnt THAT BIG, and compared to the iSkin which literally is responsible for ruining my 3rd gen 40 gig (so sticky and cheeply made) Id say its the next best thing since gucci started naking ipod cases!"
4,Good product,"I purchased two just to try them out. They work great, perfect for shortboards. Simple to install. The price is reasonable as well. Will be purchasing more in the future."
3,Works but is cheap,"I have purchased two of these sets. The plusses:1 - It keeps the boards flat against the wall2 - It is simpleThe negatives:1 - The straps (on both sets) have come apart after a few uses. I was able to resolve the issue by attaching it to a different type of drywall anchor. Not a huge deal as I still use it but make no mistake, you get what you pay for."
4,So Bad It's Good,"I am a bit biased to be writing this review because I love these old ""B"" movies. I really enjoyed this movie. I have always been a big fan of William Campbell. He usually plays bad guys and he plays them very well. A very enjoyable movie."
5,Great Crime Crama.,"True story of Caryl Chessman(1921/1960)From his childhood as a wise cracking cheap punk to his years of becoming a hard core gangster,rapist,and all around felon.Once in prison sentenced to death,Chessman writes books on law and his life which became national bestsellers.William Campell turns in a solid,unforgetable, performace as the hard core criminal.Also in cast,Marian Carr,Kathryn Grant,Vince Edwards,Bart Braverman,etc"
2,DEFINITELY NOT THE COLOR..... but,"It is a very nice dark purple as many other reviewers said but def. isn't the color that is shown, which is deceiving but it was my fault not to read previous reviews etc. And it is true that after two coats it can look black almost; especially in certain types of lighting. Anyway I am going to have to get used to it somehow or see if i can make it lighter somehow. Shipping was very accurate and other than the misleading picture I feel okay about this product. Wish i could have put two and half stars instead of two but all well."
2,"great color, but chips almost immediately","Love, Love and yes I love the color, but chips two days out. And yes I added top coat again and again. It chips!"
5,A Must For Lovers of CSI,I just love CSI and I think forensics are absolutely fascinating. This book has an amazing attention to detail. It's a book that really gets you thinking. Wecht truly reveals some gripping discoveries in these cases. A worthwhile read.
3,So many typos and bad text formating,"This book does a good job of explaining the reasoning behind the language's (sometimes strange) behavior--most of the time, anyway. The book suffers from numerous typos in the code fragments. Also, it would be nice to have a nice reference section where each command's syntax is explaned succinctly; this is important, especially because M is not a free-form language, i.e., the white spaces are significant."
2,Too much trouble.,"I bought this juicer expecting it to out-perform my current machine. However, it's just too much trouble to assemble the screw and caps and cut up vegetables and feed them in the hopper and plunge them in, slowly. With my old high speed blender that I use for carrot juices, it's simply a matter of pushing whole carrots into the top slot. Then open and clean out. Takes a minute. In sum, I would say this Samson machine may be useful for something, to someone. But please, if only I could have tried it out first."
2,great cuff but parts broke off,when i bought this cuff i loved it an wore it a lot but the claps wouldn't stay shut an then the ball holding it closed broke off with the clasp so now i have a cuff that won't stay closed on my sink i can't wear really sucks. But the designs on it are very wonderful
3,"Frame Rate is Slow, but all else is pretty good","Frame Rate is Slow, but all else is pretty good. Experience in gameplay is a little redundant. Music is great and the controls are excellent for console play."
4,Best RTS for the XBox 360,This is a great RTS - and almost as good as the PC version. The battles look and sound really great in Hi-Def on the big screen.
1,GoGo needs to go!,"First off, what the hell is gogo? and who the blue hell is chuck brown? America wants to know. I heard this gogo on the radio and thought vinilla ice made a comeback. I thought the dj couldn't spin the record stright. Who is chuck brown signed to? classical music sells more than gogo. I enven heard gogo been out for 30 years! chuck still lives with his mama! he sells his cassette tapes out the trunk. Overall, gogo just sucks! America also thinks this. Sucks, just like the wizards, the nationals, and the hockey team, if D.C. has one. D.C. isn't even a state. Just stop, please. America has been embarrased enough."
2,FLABBY SAVVY-TOO MANY BIGGGGG WORDS,"IS THE AUTHORS INTENTION TO INFORM US OR SHOW US HOW LARGE HIS VOCABULARY IS??? FOR THE AVERAGE ""JOE"" GOING ON THE 1ST CRUISE THEY CAN EASILY BE SCARED AWAY BY MR MAXTONE-GRAHAMS' USE OF EXTENSIVE VERBAL DIARRHEA. HIS VERBIAGE GIVES AN AIR OF PRETENTIOUSNESS..... REQUIRING IMMODIUM NOT DRAMAMINE.."
1,"Adobe would not activate my Dreamweaver CS3, ""unauthorized copy""","I COULD NOT ACTIVATE Dreamweaver CS3 ""online"" so I called Adobe for assistance as per the instructions [1-866-772-3623 or 1-206-675-6222]. They said this WAS NOT AUTHORIZED TO BE ACTIVATED and send it back to the seller.Since this could not be activated, THE PROGRAM ONLY GAVE ME A 30 DAY TRIAL!I see reviews that are favorable and I wonder which seller did you buy yours from?"
3,Not bad.,"I got sick of this after repeated listens, but still pretty quality.The vocals could be better though. Much better."
2,ho hum,"Seagal has a dozen films that I enjoy and some of them were made in recent years. He can still deliver and has a pretty good record when you consider that the duds are only four movies in 16. Sad to say, this one is a dud. Skip this and Out For A Kill, The Patriot, and Ticker. The rest of the films he's been involved in I enjoy and think it's impressive he's made that many fun films."
4,From the Perspective of a Former SAC Flight Surgeon,"I enjoyed the documentary. It is leaning towards the antinuclear side of the damage of the weapon and less time on the expected casualties expected by landing on Japanese soil with an anticipated 1 million GIs dying not to mention how many Japanese would be killed and that the firebombing killed more people than the Nuclear weapons. It does not discuss the possibility that Japan was ready to surrender prior to August 6. I have been to both sites, I worked in Guam not far from Tinian Island, and have seen the Nuclear Shadows in person. It is a moving experience. The movie and the sites are worthwhile seeing."
1,No supporting literature or evidence,This has to be one of the worst researched books written in this genre. The author makes claim after claim without backing up anything with literature or some kind of evidence. Even a fan of the speculation/science genre will find this book lacking of any basis for it's theories.
3,Variable speed,It Rotates way to fast. Would of been nice if it had a slower speed. ........... Four more words ....
1,Motor RPM too fast,"I recently purchased this motor. I attached it to a 12"" mirror ball in a Duffy Boat. The RPM's are too fast and there is no way to adjust the speed. Its a shame because I like the design of it compared to the units with an exposed battery which rust quickly being near the salt water harbor where I live."
2,Fun For About 2 Minuits,I started to play the game at first and had fun beating up the bad guys untill I got into the bulding and had to rescue the pepole I couldn't find any of them! This game sucks and is the worst DS game ever. However Ultimate Spider Man rulz so buy that. Well that all I can really say!
2,Tasty but...,"Holy cow! I have never seen this much grease in a boxed product like this! Also, it has enough salt to kill an entire family of slugs! Use it in your garden, don't eat it!"
3,Loreal Skin Peel helpful,"I would not call this product an ""end all, be all"" for treating acne prone skin, but it is helpful in reducing outbreaks and treating skin at home. The peels used at the dermatologist or medspa are of far stronger concentration and therefore more effective, but this product is better than not having a peel to use several times a week."
5,excellent product,"Excellent product! It is the best acne kit I have tried, and I tried many believe me. As it is made for adults, so it ia gentle but effective. the smell is not nice, but you suppose to use at night time."
2,Maybe it is not suitable for Asian girl's skin,"There are too much alcohol in it. I feel bad to smell the lotion, and my skin dosen't feel better after I use it. Maybe it just not suitable for Asian girl's skin."
3,accidental husband....,Cute movie for a chick flick night. Some language but not really that bad. I can't say it is for the whole family.A tough talking radio host gives advice to the wrong person's fiance. Revenge time (unrealistic) takes place for this radio show. It starts getting funny and then gets serious again. The ending can go either way.
3,Not as Good as I was Expecting!,"I thought the movie would be a lot better than it was. I didn't think Uma Thurman fit the part very well, and I don't think she had much chemistry with Colin Firth or Dean Morgan. It wasn't a terrible movie, but not a movie I would watch again."
2,An accidental movie,"When even the considerable charm of Colin Firth can't save a movie, it's clearly a project that should have been dropped in development. The script is leaden - every plot turn is so predictable that even a five-year-old child could have come up with something more inspired. The dialog makes the word flat seem exciting in comparison. In short this is neither romantic nor a comedy. It is a damp squib of the most tedious kind. Rather than spend two hours wasting your life in front of this drab and desperately unfunny film, it would be better to go out and do almost anything else. Even watching dead snails race would be better than seeing this movie. It simply has no redeeming feature whatsoever, aside from the fact that it eventually ends."
2,Little too far-fetched,I thought this movie was not very realistic and a little too predictable. I thought that Colin Firth was a little too high class for the role he played and overall that the movie was just a decent romantic comedy but not great by a long shot.
2,Not good at all,"What a great cast but what a horrible script they had to work with. I love chick flicks, but this was painful to watch. Jeffrey Dean Morgan was lovable, but Uma's character was annoying and she overacted the part. It wasn't that it was a predictable and simple story line, the movie was bad because it was annoying, too many stupid scenes, and too much overacting."
5,Hard to find in stores -- great shoe!,"Formal enough to wear with a suit, easy to slip off and on at airport security, and with the comfort Rockports are known for, this shoe fits the bill perfectly for me. A bit expensive, but far superior to most shoes that I've tried on in stores. Also has a nice, easy to maintain shine."
2,Ugh!,Perry makes a federal case out of every little detail of the language. Even simple aspects look complicated and difficult to follow once he's done with them. Stay away.
2,Poor quality,"First it was the wrong color which made it a duplicateof the purple and green. The ball broke in half the first time my nephew played with it,"
3,Mickey,This book would have been wonderful if new. It had pop ups missing and the book was very used and had finger marks all over it.
4,L'histoire romancée,"Excellent roman où l'on apprend du coup plein de faits historiques très intéressants. Et c'est beaucoup plus passionnant qu'un livre d'histoire! Je vais entamer la suite, SECRETUM, bientt!"
2,"RICK SHAQ GOLDSTEIN SAYS: ""THE LORD SAYETH:"" ""DO NOT USE YOUR BROTHER'S NAME IN VAIN!""","I got this CD 5 years ago, so before I wrote this review, I played it again, to make sure it was as bad as I had remembered. I don't know how you can call this blues. I would call it mopey, lethargic, boring, and completely without any soul. There's no music, that stirs anything, in your imagination. There aren't even any ""short bursts or strings"" worth remembering. In addition to a lack of any musical virtuosity, no one on this earth, ever accused Jimmie of having a great voice."
1,I.Q. went from 120 to 60....,"This was the worst movie, I have seen in all my 30 some odd years on this planet. This is what I get for being sick and just wanting to watch a low-key movie....netflix's made this sound slightly appealing. I would have rather watched dung beetles mate on a stick for an hour and a half on the discovery channel. I turned it off after 40 minutes and my flu-like symptoms intensifying as a result of chronic bad acting, and the worst dialogue on the planet. Good luck to all who watch this movie."
4,A Nice Litttle Vacuum,"I bought this vacuum because of the price and the fact that it is super light. I hate having to lug my big vacuum up or downstairs for a small minor clean up job. This machine is great for that. Spill a little dirt or have a quick clean up job, even on bare floors- then just pull it out. It is perfect to just whip around for a quick pick up. My only reason for not giving that last star is that the motor is really only 2 amps and this shows when you are trying to pick up something large. I tipped over a plant. The machine did great picking up everything except some of the larger leaf pieces.All in all, I have found this machine very handy to have around and worth the price."
3,Lasted 6 months!,"I got mine from QVC and it only lasted six months before it just decided to stop working. So, I'm out the money but it is a great vacuum when it does work. It picked up everything but the cord is extremely short. I like the disappearing handle - that's very helpful. But, IT IS VERY, VERY LOUD! My little boy just couldn't stand it whenever I used this thing and quite frankly, neither could I. Other vacuums don't bother us that much but definitely don't buy this if you are bothered by sound. I guess I really don't miss that part at all, but it did a great job picking up stuff off the kitchen floor. It would be nice to have it longer than six months - next time I'm buying a shark!"
2,BAD VACUUM!!!,"I got this vacuum Not even a year ago. I thought it was going to be a great little vacuum because of the 16amp the big ones are only 12amp and I liked it because it was small-n-light, and I didn't have a lot of cash to spend. It picked up great a first but started to clog up really fast I have a one year old that makes a big mess with crumbs and I HAVE to vacuum at least once a day. Also you cannot open the bottom to clean the brush roll. The brush roll wouldn't spin anymore and would cost more to have it fixed than what the vacuum was worth!It is also pretty load for a little vacuum. I believe this vacuum would be good for people that have hard floors only. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS VAC."
1,do not buy.,"I suggested better than this vacuum.1. Buy balloons. (balloons are much cheaper than this vacuum.2. make round balloons on the carpet (dust will be attached by balloon because of static electricity)That's it. this is more clean and much faster, and much cheaper."
1,NOT SATISFIED,I DID NOT LIKE THIS VACUUM. I HAVE A CAT AND A DOG SO YOU CAN IMAGINE I HAVE ALOT OF PET HAIR TO VACUUM. THIS DOES NOT GET EVEN CLOSE TO PICKING IT UP. AND THE MOTOR BLEW UP ON ME AFTER ONLY ABOUT 8 MONTHS OF USE. SAVE YOUR MONEY AND KEEP SHOPPING.
2,Weak,"This unit has very little suction to it. It will pick up cat hair, though requires multiple passes to lift it all up. Works really bad for dirt, sand particles, and any other type of foreign object. Overall, and OK machine for those who don't mind living in a dirty household."
1,Waste of Money....Doesn't Suck.,"I got this as a gift, but I think it that the person who got me this wasted their money.I use it to just vacuum my one bedroom apartment. I am pretty clean and don't have pets.When I first used this vacuum, it worked fine. But after the fourth time, it does not suck. I couldn't even suck up a small 1""x1"" paper! And I do clean out my filters every time I finish vacuuming. All it probably does now is sucking up dusk. That's about it.So please, spend your money on a more expensive vacuum. What you get is what you pay for. This vacuum is cheap, but in the long run you will not benefit. Your benefit, thus is below the cost. Not worth getting."
2,Lovely Shaver.,"The problem with this shaver is the replacement screen. My first one tore, and cut up my leg. I finally found the same one, even though mine was still working great. The screen on top rips, there is no replacement. Do not buy this one, I have 2 shavers and no screens for them."
1,Don't throw your money away on this.,"It arrived fairly quickly. I charged it. Used it ONE TIME. Now it will not turn on at all. Tried charging it again, no fix. Factory clearly does not test their refurbished items well. Returns must be in the original packaging for returns. The plastic bondage packaging must be destroyed to access the item. I will purchase my next shaver (not a Remington) at a local store that will take the item back if it's a piece of Junk that quits after one use!"
4,Needs some extra charge time !,"Bought this vaccuum cleaner after reading all the rave reviews this product had got on this website... Not that I am not satisfied with the performance - it really sucks the tiniest little speck of dirt off the floor.The biggest downside is the amount of time it runs on the batteries provided (~ 12-15 min) and takes another 10-12 hrs to get recharged !If you can live with that, the product is highly recommended."
2,First 60 days were great but..........,"Bought it in May 2003 to use on hardwood floors and on occasion, oriental rugs. Worked great out of the box. Its lightweight, adjustable, and convenient.Two weeks ago, the on/off switch started to not consistently work. This week, dead...I couldn't recommend buying this product based on my experience unless you want to gamble... It is a great design, but very poorly executed."
4,Great for honey beer bread,Use a tiny bit of this in my honey beer bread. It takes great. Only a little bummed that I had to buy 4 packages when I only use a few grams a loaf...guess I will be giving them out to a few people who have an interest in bread making.Looking forward to trying it out for other breads/bagels/etc.
3,"Flour, as stated, not powder","Searching the internet may tell you that malt flour is sometimes called malt powder. This may lead you to believe that this is a malt powder, such as you might use for making beer or a killer malted milkshake. Although this product is visually indistinguishable from such malt powder, it tastes like flour, and cannot be used for these purposes unless you like four in your milkshake. It does make for really good pancakes, as long as you don't add too much. I would go no more than 1/4 malt flour to 3/4 regular flour, and possibly less."
3,An interesting Music Format,"A very talented performer and an interesting format for presenting his songs. The dvd was different than I expected, but was still entertaining."
5,"Great laser mouse, but a bit overpriced","I love this laser mouse. I bought this mouse for my notebook computer, and it replaces my Targus Optical Notebook mouse with the fancy blue light. I have not used this mouse for gaming, so I cannot comment in that area. I use this mouse simply for heavy computer use and I wanted more accurate and faster tracking and this mouse does the trick. But, I feel this mouse is the same in quality and usage, for a basic heavy computer user like me, to the Kensington Laser Corded si300 Mouse (around $25 as of 1/20/07), which costs less than half the price of the Fatal1ty 2020 Laser Mouse (around $60 as of 01/20/07). I have the Kensington si300 Laser corded Mouse on my desktop computer and it works great also."
5,You have to see this movie!!!!!!,"I first saw this movie when I was about twelve years old and all I remember thinking was how brave Alice was. This is the type of movie that can really teach you something about never giving up on hope. I highly recommend WILDFLOWER to everyone and anyone, even kids. I would give ten stars if amazon allowed me to but since they don't go that high I will give my highest rating of five!"
5,Compassionate & Very Heartwarming,I watched this movie a long time ago and still talk about it everytime I hear Patricia Arquette's name. I couldn't remember the title so thanks to the internet I found it once again. I can't wait to rent it and turn my neice and other friends on to it. One of my all time favorite movies.
2,could have been good,"The ladies are attractive, but they are topless. Volume one wasn't topless. If you want nudity in a music/modeling video, there are umpteen million soft core videos with full nudity. Why buy this then? I expected another music/modeling video without nudity like volume one. The camera effects are amateurish and distracting in both. I watched it once, not again."
3,Administrative Assistant & Secretary Handbook,"Overall not bad. I ordered the book because I discovered general clerical tasks such as envelope & letter formats, answering phones, taking messages were not common knowledge to highschool graduates. This book gave our receptionist who had no office/clerical training good guidlines to follow. The computer section is outdated."
5,Nice summary of the careers of two major WWII generals,"I bought this book at an airport bookstore, and really enjoyed it. For those that don't have the time to read full biographies of Patton and Rommell, this is the book for you. If you've already read separate biographies of the two, I wouldn't necessarily recommend this book."
4,Rugged airline duffel,"Rugged wheeled duffel luggage with heavy nylon pack cloth, wheels and handle. It is two inches under the maximum luggage size before the airline check in folks take and arm and a leg ($) because of over sized baggage. It survived a 15,000 round trip flight to Ushuaia, Argentina. Looks good as new."
2,Inspired but ultimately trite,"I had to push myself complete this book. The author is intelligent and has many keen observations and mind opening views -- however this doens't add up to a good novel. The plot (did I miss it?) went nowhere. The characters were one dimensional -- they never felt true to me. Instead they seemed only representative of a certain life situation. The one redeaming quality of this book is the ""truth in advertising"" nature of the title -- it did indeed inspire me to sleep."
1,Lake Country,"Kathleen Stocking took some really cheap shots at well meaning professionals in this book. I am reminded of Adlai Stevenson's quote when describing the press and journalists in general: ""They are very good at separating the wheat from the chaff and printing the chaff""."
1,Not fit for its purpose,"I got this TV as a gift about 18 months ago. It worked well initially and I was able to get good picture quality without cable connections. But it started acting up in the last 2 months....unable to start up without suffering the 5 to 10 minutes of high pitch buzzing and the continuous switching on and off of the set. Although it was located in the bedroom, the buzzing noise bothered everyone in the family including our dog. Extremely annoying. After reading all the very helpful comments of ""fellow sufferers"" on this review board, I have decided not to waste my time on trying to find a repair solution for it but to get rid of it. I used to think better of Phillips' quality."
1,BUYER BEWARE,"Two years after purchasing a 19"" HDTV television it started acting-up. It would make this HORRIBLE noise every time we turned it on... it would shut-off then turn on... then make the noise again and shut off... and repeat this for about 15 minutes until it would stop. I sent the company a letter. Two weeks later no reply. I did a Google search and found hundreds and hundreds of unhappy customers. See for yourself at [...]Yes, it is past the manufacturers warranty, but a company that makes a product that sells for anywhere between $300 and $3000 that doesn't last more than two years should 1) be ashamed and 2) be out of business.Do your homework and find a company that makes a decent TV."
5,This book should be a mandatory read for kids in school!,I highly recommend this book for people of all ages to read. This should be mandatory in high school so kids can learn the type of behaviors to watch out for and why. It also describes how to handle an emotional blackmailer. I wish I had this book when I was younger! I grew up with a seriously disturbed mother who is a psychopath and an emotional blackmailer. Hard words to say about one's mother but that was my reality. I had to grow up fairly quickly. This book does an excellent job defining emotional blackmail so you can spot emotional blackmailers in your life and how to keep your own energy (energy vampires) and sanity! Awesome book that is easy to read. A MUST READ! It's THAT good!
5,Extremely helpful,"This book helped me to figure out that I was being emotionally manipulated in my long term relationship. It had been going on for so long that I doubted every thought I had. Not only did this book help me to separate fact from fiction, it also provided tools for combatting blackmail tactics. I highly recommend this book."
5,Great resource,This is a great resource for students in psych. Many of the students in my class had one and borrowed theirs so much I just had to buy my own.
4,Mmmmmmmmm,"Not as good as Sesmark Savory Rice Minis, but these are available at least. They are VERY good. More healthy than potato chips and a bigger crunch. Mmmmmmmm . . ."
2,Good for beginners,"If you have never been to eBay then this book is for you. It will give you the basics of buying, selling, and searching on eBay. If you have any experience at all either buying or selling, then you probably already know the things in this book.I was pretty disappointed in how outdated the book had become in just a short year. Ebay is always changing something, so some of the references are no longer valid."
4,Lots of fun!,"A fun ship to play with, that has really cool mini-figures and features -- trap doors, opening platforms, hidden turret guns, sails and other great stuff. But it is very big, and some kids might find it too big. This set was not too durable, and pieces of it did come off that needed rebuilding."
5,Inflation to the max,Found this review on [...]Year of Release: 2006Film:Episode VI: Return of the JediPieces: 781Minifigures: 7Boba FettGamorrean GuardHan SoloLando CalrissianLuke SkywalkerPrincess LeiaR2-D2MSRP (Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price): $74.99
2,V is not so good,"V is not a good album by live, in fact i think by this time they totally lost their way...You can hear even some RAP here, and most of the songs are really uninspired...If you want to hear LIVE look for MENTAL JEWELRY or THROWING COPPER..."
2,Waste Of Money,"I went uptown hoping to get a brand new CD cause I listened to much to the other ones. There's 3 choices: Slipknot(first one), new SOAD CD or this. I chose this. Tomorrow, I'm returning it. That's how bad this is. The only song I like is Simple Creed. I heard that this is a more aggressive release. Where? It's filled with ballads some rock songs almost rap style like vocals. Ed's voice sounded great on early work like Lightning Crashes, I Alone and Lakini's Juice. Here, he sounds bad. Like a cheap version of Axl Rose on some of the songs. On the ""Forever...."" song, it sounds so bad when he keeps saying Forever during the chorus I couldn't help but chuckling. Live fans might [...not be happy about this...] review but we all have our opinions and in plain english: Download ""Simple Creed"" or get the first 4 albums cause this is not a good addition."
2,What's the point of Live releasing a cd if it stinks?,"If you liked throwing copper, you won't like this cd. Although there are several good songs,(Call Me A Fool and Overcome), the rest of the album is not even worth listening to. I always give a cd several listenings to let it grow on me, but it just wouldn't happen with this cd. When I bought V, I also bought the Verve Pipe's new album ""Underneath"". I highly recommend the Verve Pipe's latest effort. Practically every song on it is a great song. I usually don't just download a cd, but I recommend that you just download the songs call me a fool, and overcome."
