2,Not Worth To Buy...,It is a vey Condensed Copy of the original one. It is a kind of disappointment for me when I got the delivery.Try to buy the original one not the student version...
5,Why buy granolia bars?,These are a great substitute for granolia bars and much better for you. They are not based on grains but on greens instead. Taste is a tad bit green but if you eat whole foods at all then you'll love these. -Plus they give a good energy boost throughout the day!
2,Not so good.,"As a young musician, Roy Gaines has played many amazing guitar parts with some of the blues greats (Bobby Bland, Junior Parker, etc. on the Duke label), which gives him a place in the blues history.As a leader, he has recorded several good records, but he has never really found his way to become a blues great of his own.On this cd, everything is welldone, but nothing is amazing - seems like there's always something missing. With only one song really strikin (the beautiful ""World's greatest fool""), this cd is not a blues-must-buy.So take a listen before buying it ...."
4,The Crusaders: Live at Montreux 2003,I love the sounds from the Crusaders and mix with Randy Crawford its make Street Life seems smooth and even more relaxing
4,Get the Japanese version with bonus Larry Carlton footage!,"This is a fine concert, I can't add anything that all the other reviews have stated so nicely...EXCEPT...the import version of this concert includes a 20 minute live Crusaders show from the late 70's, and features (then) Crusaders guitarist Larry Carlton, which includes a live version of ""Spiral"". Great stuff! There is very little live stuff on Carlton from that period and the Crusaders sound much more inspired in that footage, I must say!"
1,WHY REINVENT THE WHEEL OF BLANDNESS,"I WASTED MY MONEY AND TIME. I MADE THE BBQ PORK RIBS AND BAKED BEANS. THEY WERE EXTREMELY BLAND. THE AUTHOR MUST BE A NURSING HOME COOK. ONLY AFTER MIXING IN A WHOLE BOTTLE OF KC MASTERPIECE BBQ SAUCE AND WARMING THIS MESS UP AGAIN WERE THEY PALATABLE! IN WAY LESS TIME THAT IT TOOK TO SHOP FOR INGEDIENTS, PREPARE THE BLAND TASTELESS BBQ SAUCE AND THE BLAND BAKED BEANS, I COULD HAVE OPENED A CAN OF BUSHES' BBQ BAKED BEANS AND POURED A BOTTLE OF KC MASTERPIECE BBQ SAUCE OVER THE RIBS, THEN NUKED THEM AND HAD A TASTY MEAL. MY QUESTION IS, WHY GO TO THE TROUBLE, TIME AND EXPENSE TO CREATE A BLAND RECIPE WHEN THERE ARE ALREADY PLENTY OF TASTY BBQ BEANS IN A CAN AND BBQ SAUCES ON THE GROCERY SHELVES? WE DON'T NEED MORE LOW FAT NO TASTE BLAND RECIPIES. I PUT THE BOOK IN THE WHITE ELEPHANT BOX TO GIVE FOR A GAG GIFT!"
1,Buy the Original a Man a Can a Plan cookbook instead,"This sequel is cashing in on the Original A Man A Can cookbook that was surprisingly very useful for my bachelor sons. It had dozens of tasty recipes that the boys could do easily by opening several cans of easily procured and stored foods.This one, however is just a microwave cookbook. It involves buying pounds of meat , shrimp, chicken and unprepared foods that need to be cooked properly before even assembling. This is WAY too much trouble for a bachelor when you can heat a frozen pizza in 15 minutes.You might as well just borrow your Mom's microwave cookbook and learn to cook beef and chicken, spending an hour cooking dinner. Do you really want to do this?"
5,"Jorge, Jorge, Jorge of the Projects.","The guy who said this album wasn't a gem has serious problems. This album is great from beggining to end. Jorge's laid back style is indeed refreshing, and you must be hitting the pipe if you don't think hes skilled. All the beats on this album are lovely, classic boom-bap. However, Kurious and his enjoyable style make every song. There are also great guest spots made by Casual and Grimm Reaper (aka MF/GM Grimm). Its a crime that this album is mad slept on. Kurious has a new album in the works, so look out for that one aswell."
2,Cute but that's about it,Doesn't do justice to the stories. The nutshell library is very tiny and though it's extremely cute for the Maurice collectors.
3,nutshell books,"these books are great to have along with the rosie cd, but I guess I didn't realize they were going to be so small ( nutshell ) still nice to have the collection."
5,Perfectly Tiny!,"I just returned from Thanksgiving at Mom and Dad's, or Grandma and Papa as they are now known. My two year old found this set of well worn books that my younger brother loved so much as a kid. When we left, we nearly had to pry ""Chicken Soup"" out of his grip. I'm ordering a set for him for Christmas and there is no doubt that it will be his favorite present. I was surprised to see several reviewers complaining about the size of these books. While the size may surprise people, it should be said that their size is part of their magic. Little hands love carrying these around since they are sized for them. I look forward to reading these stories again and again. A great treasure!"
3,review of Nutshell Library,"I am a big fan of M Sendak, but these are too small to be interesting to a youngster of four years."
4,Adorable little collection,"I loved Chicken Soup with Rice so much as a kid that my husband ordered this teensy collection for our toddler son. It's difficult in some ways for a small child, as the books are miniature with small pictures and real, rip-able pages and book jackets, but this four-volume set is just so adorable that I can't give it less than a four-star rating. In love!"
2,Don't buy it,"I'm sorry, this game was really disapointing! I LOVE barrel racing, but this game was the worst I've ever played. The people's faces look like plaster, and all around the game is just to short! AND NOTHING TO DO! (plus the horses look pretty freaky too) I bet it would be good for really young kids (like 3-7) or something, but not good for older people. If you want a really good barrel racing one, try ""Let's Ride! Silver Buckle Stables."" It's MUCH MUCH better!!!!"
1,VERY BAD!!!,"I got this and was highly dissapointed. All you can do is barrel race, you can not ride on ANY trails, and the person looks goofy!Dont waste your money on this game!!"
4,Pride and Prejudice (with a twist),"""Lions and Liquorice"" is basically a modern adaptation of Jane Austen's ""Pride and Prejudice"" with a few curve balls thrown in along the way. It is a must read for any ""Pride and Prejudice"" fanatics or someone who must know the gist of the original story, but can't quite get it."
5,Should Be Required Reading,"""Make it Work"" is a rare find. A book that gets right to the principles and practices that will transform your career and your life."
1,Pure Krav Maga,"If you are a beginner you might gain something from this video but having studied Martial Arts for over 40 years this was not worth the money! I have never been so disappointed with a Krav Maga video, I teach military and civilians, it will be of no use to me."
5,good drink'n music,my title speaks for itself............these two guys gotta get together more often........if you play this though; you should warn your neighbors
3,Naruto will always be cool,"I would rate this 4 stars but its mostly about naruto meeting his other friends that he didn't meet in the first episodes like Ino,Shino,Kiba and hinata which is still cool.And like always when ever kakashi uses his sharingan too much, he gets hurt. so Lady tsunade call for an anbu black ops member to fill in for kakashi. his name is Captain Yamato. he's pretty cool.He's like a stronger version of iruka sensei, narutos first teacher Oh and guest what Tobi's on this dvd so I guest this dvd is mostly seeing old friends and a new enemy,I hope this review was helpful thanks."
2,Buy the original,"Amazon lists the Lesiem CD ""Times"" with this one as a special. Don't be fooled to think these are different CDs!! they are the same, though this one has English titles. Plus, the Import version contains vocals on a few songs by the fabulous Maggie Reilly (former vocalist with Mike Oldfield) and an excellent artist in her own right. Check out her solo works (her greatest hits is a nice place to start if unfamiliar with her) and buy Lesiem's ""Times"" instead!"
3,Overly upbeat,"I got this CD based on the cover statement that it was sarah brightman meets enigma. Although the music is well crafted, and I enjoy any album with Latin in it, I found the English portions so upbeat and cheery as to be unbearable. The nice dark tones of Enigma certainly are not present. If you want lots of nice happy messages thrown at you, this album is fine. For me, if they completely skipped the English and kept it textural rather than uplifting it would have been much better."
2,Some Other Reviews Must Be Fakes,"The production quality of these videos is so laughably amateurish [...]. There's some useful information, but the video looks so cheap that it's hard to even stay awake and watch."
1,hard as a rock,"well we got the mattress about 2.5 weeks ago, based on these reviews. I don't know how anyone can be comfortable on this mattress, I'm a big guy and barely sink in and when I roll over wich is always I have to start all over, I don't like it too much but my wife just can't stand it, were hoping it gets better but we're probably out the 500 bucks. if anyone knows which bed to get that would be great and by the way that smell is just horrible but is mostly gone finally. aj"
5,This is a great mattress!!!,"I haven't slept this well in a long time. There was a little discomfort at first with the mattress with retaining body heat, but other than that I find it hard to get out of bed in the morning. I definitely recommend this mattress to anyone who had back problems."
2,Not for me,"I bought this about 3 months ago and while the first couple of months was fine, I started getting really bad back aches. At first I thought it was from my highly physical work (UPS) until I started sleeping on the floor, now my back is much better. Maybe this bed isn't for everyone, it sure isn't for me. Im thinking about adding a foam topper and hope that helps to where I can sleep on a bed again."
2,"Sometimes amusing, sometimes offensive","There were parts of this movie that were quite funny. Unfortunately, they were balanced almost equally with humor that was uncomfortable or downright offensive. Also excessive nudity in places that didn't really warrent it. Funny premise, but execution is lacking."
1,Disappointing,I thought this movie was more about how Jessica Alba wasn't lucky I guess I should have read the back of the dvd! Some of the parts were funny but for the most part it was just about sex. Not a very good movie and I will be taking it to blockbuster to hopefully get some of my money back.
4,video,Easy process of purchase. Disappointed that it won't play on Android tablet that doesn't support Adobe Flash. Can watch on Kindle and computer.
4,Fun romantic Comedy,"If you take this movie for what is worth, Simple romantic comedy with Incredibly hot Jessica Alba and you don't try to compare this with Sleepless in Seattle or When Harry met Sally you will have a good time."
2,"Likeable, although obviously filled with potty humour","Despite myself I actually liked it. It helps to have low expectations for these romcoms. Besides the fact that it's impossible to jump start a Prius with a regular car battery, the movie was pretty entertaining. Some parts are sweet and others are funny. In the end, I found myself laughing. It's a feel-good pointless movie, but one could do a lot worse than this in the genre (think The Ex, Shallow Hall)."
1,RUBBISH,The film is great. But it would be even better if I had RECIEVED IT.STILL WAITING FOR IT. VERY BAD SERVICE
2,Misleading . . .,"I really thought this was going to be a cute romantic comedy . . . I was wrong. I enjoy Dane Cook most of the time, and Jessica Alba too . . . even the story line wasn't half bad . . . what really killed this movie for me was the obnoxious plastic surgeon sidekick. Dan Fogler was also in Take Me Home Tonight with Topher Grace and I am not sure I can even watch that because I cannot stand the sight of him."
1,Horrifying.,"I love hilarious, raunchy humor, Super Bad, Blades of Glory, you name it. This was so bad I couldn't believe what I was watching, so much wrong I don't know where to begin. At it's heart there's a standard romantic comedy, but it's handled about as badly as anything I've ever seen. This was the directorial debut of Mark Helfrich, a fairly respected film editor. This kind of comedy requires a deft, experienced hand, but even an experienced director would have found it impossible to score saddled with this horrible, limp screenplay filled with mediocre sight gags and crude lingo that's about unhip as The Partridge Family. Every body tries, but it still arrives D.O.A. I thought the ""extras"" might provide a laugh, but the ad libs, the blooper reel, etc., all showed how unfunny this entire project was. Compared to this, Porky's seems like Shakespeare."
4,Very funny adult move,This is a good movie. Not one for the Baptist community but funny with a good ending. I liked it.
2,"Should be called, ""Dane Cook makes a porno""","This movie was not funny, was not interesting and had too much gratuitous sex. I won't even honor this movie by calling it a chick flick as it was awful."
2,Cast worked as well as they could with what they had,"Let's see....I do seriously think that Dane Cook is a very good comedian and surprisingly Jessica Alba actually had some great comedic timing....however, I do feel sorry for them in the fact that the storyline or the script was a bit lacking. So they did the best they could under the circumstances. There were some funny moments and some good one-liners but overall I was really cringing in some parts."
5,Healthy dog food for larger-medium and large dogs,I have two dogs - 1 54lbs and 1 90lbs. Both can be picky eaters but will eat this without problems. It was recommended to me by my vet and I will try to continue to get it.
5,my mantra,"'Natural' envelopes you in an atmosphere that is warm, inviting,gently philosophical, and spirited. I have played this recording'too many times' and i still hold it dearly. Consumate playingand subtle masterful arrangements. As welcome as a cool oceanbreeze on a hot summers day. It's one of my all times faves."
5,Do you like Samba and Bossa Nova?,"This is one of the more recent cds of Celso's. Very, Very good. You will listen to it over and over again. I promise!"
3,Nothing New Here,"I've always felt there is no such thing as bad bossa nova, so I won't call this a bad album. Boring maybe, but not outright unlistenable. Fonseca brings nothing new to the table, but his voice is pleasant enough even if his guitarwork is a little bland. In short, there's nothing on this album to really hold your attention, but it makes nice background music if you're sipping a pina colada (then again, what doesn't?). If you already own everything by Gilberto or Jobim, and you're looking for something to diversify your bossa nova collection, this may be worth considering."
1,Flunked Usability 101,"This phone could not have been engineered with a user in mind. It has volume, camera and voice command buttons on both of the sides, right where one normally grips a phone. I've owned it for about 6 months and my patience has run out. When I pick it up, the volume of the ringer changes, or I accidently start taking pictures of the inside of the lens cap, or it goes into ""driving mode"" incessantly instructing me to ""please say a command"". Avoid this model. Oh and one more annoying feature is I cannot customize my voice mail message."
1,This phone is the worst,"Yeah, I mean it. This phone is the worst in reception and battery life, two most important areas one would look for in a good phone.I have been using this for a while now (more than a year) and I have at least one dropped call in a day. I make hardly 10 to 15 calls a day and one out of 10 is not 3%, you moron (I am addressing the customer service rep here who told me 3 to 5% of dropped calls is quite normal).The best place for this phone is the gutters, not your pocket."
4,Great Phone!,Have had the 6100 for a couple days and love it! I had an Audiovox 8900 which I wasn't a huge fan of so I wanted to do a lot of research before committing to a new phone. I learned alot from online reviews and decided on the VX6100. I love the speakerphone and voice dialing - both features any professional who spends time in the car like I do would love! Having a camera phone isn't important to me but the camera seems good and the lense cover is a great idea. Voice dialing and auto answer are really cool and functional. I was considering a VX4500 since it had the same basic functions as this one but what sold me was the Analog roam on the 6100. Seems crazy to go to have a dual band phone when so many are tri-mode.
5,One of Cat Steven's Best,"I was weaned on Cat Stevens. Wore out the album, then wore out the cassette, then was thrilled to find this here. I now have it permanently on my IPod, where it remains one of my favorite albums alone with Tea for the Tillerman. Timeless music."
5,A longstanding favorite,"I stumbled on this book in a public library in New York back in '96 and was immediately captivated. It stuck with me so I eventually purchased a copy and have also bought it for many friends. What Girardi does with great skill is locate his books (I've since read all but one of his novels and novellas). Madeleine's Ghost is set in NYC and in New Orleans, and in both settings, there is no where else they could have been set. Each place is as much a part of the story as any of the characters. Both cities feel fully alive and real. I personally love fiction that is so deeply rooted in places, so Madeleine's Ghost is a go to favorite."
2,Not Westlake's Best,"Donald Westlake is a wonderfully warm and funny author. His books Trust Me on This, Hot Rock, and Cops and Robbers are the epitome of his style and very much worth reading. This book isn't.I hate to say that it wasn't only that this book wasn't what I expected, it just wasn't very good. If you're looking for a good starter Westlake, try just about any in the Dortmunder series, but don't try Pity."
3,Was This Interracial................??????,".............not to me! The book was a fast and good read. However, what I thoroughly cannot stand is when a book is classified as interracial and the male character is just a light skin black man. Authors, your readers are not stupid!"
1,Sucks so bad....,"This movie is horrible....nothing like the first one... Just a low budget not fit to use the name ""Christmas Vacation"" waste of time movie...."
3,OK,"I loved the vacation series so much that I was hoping for so much more. I like cousin Eddie, but this one fell down a little bit."
5,Funny,"Very good movie that was really funny and fun to watch, highly recommend it if you like to laugh and feel good!"
1,Horrible,"Bad acting, not funny ... Surprised that Ed Asner would show in this movie. Not in line with all others in this series."
5,When comes a new edition?,"The book is truly outstanding, but considering the pace medice and pharmacology moves on we need a new edition"
1,Another very weak book,"I should have learned my lesson when I read her last book, but since someone gave them both to me as a gift, I plunged ahead....much to my dismay. Another totally boring and predictable mystery. I definately would not waste my time or money on this book. God, please don't let me get another one of her's as a gift!"
3,waiting to see this wonder,"This movie was in news as the return of the 1970s hit pair Rajesh Khanna and Zeenat Aman. Great hype was there and the die hard old living fans of Rajesh Khanna were eager to watch this movie. However, the movie came and went. Nobody knew of its release- when the movie was released and went off the theaters. Its release could have been better handled. It is yet to be released in many territories of India. Its CDs/ DVDs are not released too. We are wanting to see the movie to judge how the old couple looks after 30 years. We were sure that this movie will bring back the charm of Rajesh Khanna who has been not seen of late too often in movies and could have done much better for himself and his fans had he continued to act and do movies."
3,Word Lover's Book of Unfamiliar Quotations,"This book has many quotations that I had never heard before, but it also had ones that I looked for and couldn't find in a larger book. A nice addition to anyone's library. I even liked it better than the much larger book I ordered ""Bartlett's Familiar Quotations"". ""Word Lover's Book of Unfamiliar Quotations"" alone would have done me just fine."
4,Great work gloves!,"These gloves are a great fit for women. I use them for all types of ranch work and wouldn't be without a couple pair at all times! With the rough work I do, the gloves only last a couple seasons, but they wash up nicely and keeping them clean makes them last longer. I also use the Tuff Chix gloves for lighter work, like gardening and really like those as well.I wear a Medium in both gloves and measure out at a size 7-71/4."
5,A wonderful movie,"I've always been a fan of fairy tales, and love the brothers Grimm versions. This movie is short simple and just fun to watch. Would be great for any kid or anyone who loves fairy tales. I really enjoyed King Thrushbeard!"
3,"Cute, but overpriced...","It looks cute, my son has yet to play with it. There is a store that begins with TJ Ma.. that has it for 7.99....a big difference!"
4,I love this book,This book is awesome. Hearty comfort food that never misses. And it has my one basic prerequisite for any cook book....many many fantastic pictures.
5,Superb,This is a suberb collection from one of the most underrated early bluesman and would be a great primer for the uninitiated.
5,Great!!!!!!!,"This case it great. It's small but big enough to hold the clarinet and accessories. It is very lightweight. I got this as a christmas present, and I'm enjoying it allready. The only thing a little wrong with it, is that when you put your mouthpeice cap over the mouthpeice it's kinda trick to fit it in. But I found a way that it works. I recommend this case to everyone."
4,Great CD!,"this was a great cd... Danielle collaborates with Gregg Alexander very well in this album... I LOVE the song ""Promise Tomorrow Night""..."
2,Should have listened to the samples,"After reading other reviews, I expected something a little more.Other than Gimme Little Sign, the first listen did not impress.Maybe it will grow on me. If not, my Daughter may like it."
4,"""Bride Of New Radicals""","_Maybe You've Been Brainwashed Too_ from the New Radicals was easily one of the best albums I've heard in the last decade. So When I found out about Danielle's _Arrive All Over You_ & Gregg Alexander's input/production of the album, I picked it up and was not disappointed at all. This is an excellent album of fun clever pop/rock songs, as well as poingant tracks such as ""Just Missed The Train"" and ""Promise Tomorrow Tonight"". It is a *must have* for any fan of the New Radicals or for anybody who is tired of the dreary, boring similarity of what is currently being shoved down our throats on most radio stations."
5,"Excellent cage- weight, grip, it has it all.","I've actually held back on posting a review for this cage sooner because I wanted some time to test it out on the road before critiquing. Pretty much this cage does it all- probably the best I've used so far (I've gone through a few)..The cage itself is listed as 17grams, but the manufactures also include two aluminum bolts to bring the total to 20grams. Even at its weight, the cage does not compromise strength or handling. Never dropped my bottle yet, even through rough potholes and the likes.Great cage, I should have tried this sooner."
3,Not Bad,I used this book to study for the R4.x AD1 exam and found that it was ok. The only problem was a great number of errors within the text and the software. Quite a few of the answers on the self test software were most defintley wrong.
5,CHAOS REIGNS AMONGST BROTHERLY LOVE!,"Okay, so maybe you love to read books but find your most recent selections a little dull. Read this book, and you will forever be warned against drinking warm milk, killing chickens and becoming a goatboy.Matthew Buckley and his six siblings have raised the childhood antics we all know and love to an unparalleled level. While his parents have somehow managed to stay sane amongst this chaos of brotherly love, the rest of us get to experience the insane laughter one only gets from sitting on the sidelines and not actually having to dodge an errant pillow, bits of jam, or chicken ""gravy"".Having written in his journal from a very young age, Buckley reaches back and picks out a summer where the ""joy of the journey"" encompasses a visit to Grandmas, several hilarious chicken roundups, and a time simply made better because it was shared with his brothers."
5,Excellent foundation,"I love this foundation - you don't need a lot because it applies very thinly providing great coverage, does not cause me to break out, and really helps to even out my skin tone. It does what a foundation should do.By the way don't let the price deter you - a little of this foundation goes a long way."
2,Doesn't fit my charger,"Unlike most NIMH D-cells, which are C, or even AA, guts in a D-size shell this one is an honest 10,000ma-h, full D battery. The problem is that it doesn't quite fit my charger: The overall length is OK, but the ""shoulders"" of the battery are higher than standard, so the + terminal doesn't quite reach far enough into the contact cavity of my charger. If you use a charger where the contacts are at or above the surface, you should be OK.One cell refused to accept a charge after about a dozen cycles, so I'm not impressed.There are better batteries out there, but they're not cheap. TryAccuEvolution Low Self Discharge NiMH D Cells."
3,Free Version Almost Better,"I bought Album 2.0 after using the free ""Starter Edition"" online, which I really liked. Turns out the free version actually has different features .. many of which work work better! For example, the free version has a really good red-eye reduction while the full version is seems worse. The free version includes Auto Levels, Auto Contrast, Auto Color, while the full version only includes Adobe's poor ""automated"" lighting and color controls that degrade image quality and aren't as good as the tools in the free version. Worst of all, they don't even include basic brightness and contrast in the full version! I actually reverted back to the free version to get the better editing tools. Unbelievable Adobe .. what's up!?! Wish they could learn from Apple and iPhoto!"
2,Know your camera first..,"I was so excited for the prospect of finally organizing all my photo files. I downloaded product easily and stared in amazement at the end result. I have over 3000 images on my computer and 90% of them were dumped on the date Jan. 2000 ( a year and a half before I owned camera) Of the remaining 10% only a fraction were properly date-stamped. The problem...my camera reverts back to 1/1/00 every battery change. Obviously, this product is useless with my inaccurate date stamp data....garbage in, garbage out.Seems to me this caveat should be clearly explained up front! Big dissapointment."
3,A Warning About Raw Files & Suggestion About A Download,"I planned to save my RAW files created by my Canon Digital Rebel and was surprised to learn that, while Photoshop Album 2.0 can handle a number of different RAW formats, those created by that (popular) digital camera are not recognized (I confirmed this with Adobe). So, beware; check the Adobe web site for info about your camera before buying this package.If you do purchase Photoshop Album 2.0, be sure to go to the Adobe Web site and look for recent downloads in order to get the latest version -- 2.0.1 Apparently this corrects a number of 'issues' that have plagued this program."
2,"""Tim Dog loses his momentum""","The ""Penecillen On Wax"" must've worn out by the time Tim put this CD together. Being that he could no longer capatilize on the gimmick of ""F**K COMPTON"", Tim was forced to add more original material, which of course, by the time that it was released, became immaterial. Maybe he should've kept the relentless attack on ""happy rappers"". There are one topic MC's out there that know that that's what they're good at (take Freddie Foxx for example) and stick to that formula. Tim Dog is an attack MC, therefore he should've stuck to the original formula. The only good songs on this CD are the ones with KRS and Smooth B (of Nice & Smooth). Other than that, this CD falls short."
5,Awesome filtration with a nut on the end for the eventual oil change.,"I love this filter. After a horrible experience removing my last filter, it is refreshing to know that I have a nut for removing this one with a socket wrench. The oil filter on the VRSCF is hidden under the bike, so chrome is really not necessary. If it came in black, I would prefer that, but the chrome does not bother me. What I really love is that the oil filter on the Muscle is also hard to reach for changing. The next oil change is going to be a breeze.As far as the quality of the filtration, I have been using it for 3000 miles and my oil still looks brand new."
3,A dim reflection.,"An aluminum and plastic disk cannot possibly contain the sheer mayhem that is Crash Worship live. However, if you enjoy drumming, experimental, or industrial music, and own a suitably powerful stereo system, their recorded music can be enjoyable in its own right. Espontaneo! was Crash Worship's first CD, and contains a few very long tracks, recorded live. Some may find this boring and repetitious. I feel it helps convey some of the trance-inducing qualities of their performances.Someone liked my copy well enough to steal it, so I'm just happy to see that it's been reprinted."
3,No substitute for the Women's Utility,"Ironclad makes great gloves, and these are no exception. The problem is in the fit. Ironclad's old women's fit gloves,the Women's Utility (no longer available), were amazing. I went through two pairs a year doing barn chores, gardening, and hauling firewood. The fingers of these new gloves are significantly longer,leaving half-inch flaps at the ends of my fingers--just like most gloves, but not Ironclad's old women's fit. If you've got long fingers, these are great gloves. If, like me, you need gloves made for short fingers (a lot of women), keep looking."
2,not what I expected.,"I must say Hallmark movies are feel good stories,This Harlequin pk. was disappointing for me.. really need to show outlineof stories, so we can see the storylines,I may not watch any of this pk.which is a waste of money.drew"
1,What Not to Buy,"Unlike the other reviewers, I was very disappointed in this book. It addressed only a few figure flaws and did not offer any advice on how to dress for my particular figure problems (flat butt, broad hips, square shoulders). Little or no mention was made as to the effects of colors or types of fabrics and fabric designs on different figure types. In my opinion, this book does not have much ""meat"" to it, and has nothing new to offer. I have seen all of the suggestions made in the book mentioned elsewhere."
2,What Not to Wear,I was disappointed. The info was very basic...actually TOO basic for what they actually charged for the book. I will probably give the book away; would not recommend buying it. The humor was not worth the cost.
1,Not that great,The book only had a few tips and most of the tips aren't very useful. I think a better purchase would have been the Stacey and Clinton book.
1,I don't know where to begin because this book is so bad!,"Fist of all, I'll start off buy saying ladies, if you're 25 or under, this book is not for you!!!Second, if you only identify with one or two attributes categorized in this book, this book will not help you very nuch, as you will only be looking at a maximum of 10 pages from the entire book. Plus, the help is so generic and limited. They only give you a list of 4 or 5 helpful cuts/lines/lengths, and a series of 4 or 5 stlyes/etc. to avoid. Well, I realized that there are FAR more stlyes/etc. in the world than 5, so if I go to the store and find something NOT mentioned in the book, how am I supposed to know if I can wear it or not!? Most books are designed to give you a starting point to further progress your fashion savvy conscious, but this book did no such thing. It was a dead end leaving you wondering what the heck you're supposed to do now. DON'T BUY THIS BOOK. EVEN IF YOU FOUND A $0.50 DEAL, IT'S NOT WORTH IT."
5,A must have fashion book,"I love Trinny and Susannah. Unlike their American counterpart, T&S; really explain the rules of what and what not to wear for each part of your body you love and loathe.This book is very simplistic, full of pictures to demonstrate how to camouflage the parts of your body you want to keep under wraps. It's easy to follow rules to show off the parts of your body that you like and hide the parts you loathe.I would never have spent $300.00 for a jacket before T&S.; But with their rules in hand and a 3-way mirror in the dressing room, I am confident in my purchases. The clothes I have bought post T&S; don't hang in my closet collecting dust. They are my favorites and they are the clothes I constantly get compliments on.I have no waist and a big stomach. I know how to camaflouge that area after T&S; and I know how to play up my assets. A great read and a reference book you'll return to again and again."
1,Don't waste your money.,"The book is full of pictures... fun to look at, but does not give good understand of what items to actually buy.A MUCH BETTER choice would be: Does This Make Me Look Fat? : The Definitive Rules for Dressing Thin for Every Height, Size, and Shape by Leah Feldon. This book has excellent advice.If you're still not convinced, preview it at the library. You'll be done with it after the checkout line wait.TC"
4,Good Information......,"The information is this book is really good. However, it is pretty funny that in the pictures of what you shouldn't wear the authors went to the trouble of posing in the worst possible posture (see page 80). I don't care what you have on, if you are standing as the author is on page 80, it will look bad. The pictures are pretty fun... not even a smile while posing for what you shouldn't wear. Overall, the book has good information and I recommend it."
3,Most of what I own is what not to wear!,"Not very insightful. I like these girls on TV, but the book left me clueless. I still do not know what current styles will look good on me. A better book is Nothing to Wear?: A Five-Step Cure for the Common Closet. It talks about body types and style preferences. And give you a plan to clean your closet and avoid buying mistakes in the future."
4,"So good, but SO incomplete","Are we ever gonna get any of those early gems? The song that introduced so many of us to Grace Jones was the Tom Moulton 12"" mix of That's The Trouble. Why is that never on any reissue? I know we're all supposed to say that Grace wasn't so important until Nightclubbing, but those early albums and 12 inch singles were fun and creative and quirky, and miles ahead of their contemporaries. It would be outstanding to have a reissue of those first three albums and all the 12 inch mixes that came out of the. Tom Moulton & Grace jones - a real dream team of the disco era."
2,Seems like an awful waste of paper,"Don't waste your time nor money on this book. I don't know if Kal is a disinformer or if he is just an ignorant author. Either way, his writing in this book is way off base. His derisive passive aggressive attack on W. Stevens is ridiculous. Now, I don't know about the case surrounding W. Stevens, but I do know enough to realize that if the CIA wants you/your reputation discredited, that is kindergarten work for those guys. One doesn't just 'lay your proof out on the table..' and prove the CIA manipulated the legal system. Anyway, KKK's writing is anything but objective and it's a shame books like his get published. If you are still interested in reading this pile of steaming pooh, I have a copy I'd be willing to part with for a very good price."
1,'Heavy debunking by Korf,This is no objective analysis of the Billy Meier case. Korf does a lot of mudslinging and debunking. I have a lot of insight into this case and I believe that Britt and Lee Elders did the definive investigation many years ago. The conclusion of Elders was that Billy Meiers photos and films were genuine after have been analyzed in laboratories in USA.It is my firm belief after viewing the evidence that Billy Meier has indeed been contacted by a woman from the Pleiades called Semjase.
1,A Poorly researched Book,"Unfortunately, the research in the book is sub-standard and the author draws conclusions from his own opinions. The tone seems antagonistic. I wonder what the ""real"" motive behind the book was?"
2,Disappointed,I was disappointed in this DVD. Many of the scenes were childlike and the scenes were not as breathtaking as expected. I was hoping for more of a DVD as displayed in Bed Bath & Beyond which I should have just paid the extra money for. Sometimes you do get what you pay for.
2,Animation?,"Some of the scenes, such as the beach scene, look like animations rather than real scenes. Another reviewer said, ""child-like,"" and I agree."
1,Not worth it!,"I was looking for a specific sized filter for a custom intake but the ones on ebay were all too big with a 6"" outer diameter. I decided to give this one a try because according to Vibrant, this filter's outer diameter is only 5"". What showed up was identical to the $14 ebay filters, it measured 6"" wide and didn't fit! It was a complete waste of my time since now I have to order a K&N that has been properly measured (tried and true filters are worth the extra price). If this 6"" wide filter will work for you, then get the same generic one for half the price on ebay."
3,Nice quality,"Overall nice and the color was as shown. I would rate it higher, but runs a little small and XL, would be too large."
4,Kids rule Barney is the best,"I also thought that the whole video was kind of slow not the average fun Barney delivers, but my kids watched it 5 times the first day and it was difficult to keep them away from the tv, still is, so I think if they like it, its good.I think they don't mind about some things being not so scientifically acurate.Good buy"
5,Best Of The Series,"The Frankie Bones Mix is the best of the United DJ's Of America Series, & In my opinion is the best official cd release he has ever put out to date bar none. I recommend it to any electronic music collectors or old school rave & techno fans that might have missed it the 1st time around.The only drawback to listening to this mix is hearing the sound of a scene growing into what was supposed to be the next big thing & then realizing that the american electronic scene just imploded in on itself almost in as much time as it took to record this cd.Either way frankie bones ranks right up there with Ozzy Osbourne & Jim Morrison in my book."
1,not what it seems,"does not look like the photo. very small. it would take about 10 to make a ""rug"" and would look bad. returned."
4,Photographs well,i ordered this to use for a floor mat in my photography. It looks great in the photographs. But keep in mind the size when ordering this. It looks bigger in the picture. It is the average size door mat. You can only use this for babies.
4,Cute toy,"My 11-month old likes this toy, but not as much as I thought he would. He likes to chew on the long legs, which are great for babies who are teething. Overall a nice toy, but not sure if I would buy it again for the price."
2,Not that helpful,"I did not find this book to be helpful on the trip. It was a pretty book to look at but did not provide enough information, good maps or tips beyond what I could look up quickly on my phone. I bought it because of the cheap price but I barely used it. I did not have an alternate book so I used tripadvisor.com"
3,not very educational,"I am giving this 3 stars because my son loves Barney, and they are the only dvds he pays attention to. But this video was a big disappointment. He will not learn anything from this. There is not nearly enough attention placed on numbers to have labeled this a counting dvd. If you are looking for something to help teach your child to count, try Meet the Numbers from Preschool Prep. It lacks the appeal of Barney, but they'll learn to count in no time."
5,A great bathroom read,"I recently moved to Memphis, TN from Pennsylvania. I picked up this book to familiarize myself with TN history. It is an excellent book for reading on the ""thinking chair"". I picked out a number of places to visit with my family, based on the short articles and topics in the book."
1,Do not buy this,I purchased this unit. I made about 15 labels with it and then it ceased to work.Contacted the manufacturer regarding the warranty and they would not give me a replacement unit. This unit is awful.I spent a pile of money on it and label media kits that are nothing other than a door stop now.I'm switching to Dymo.
1,Overpriced and redundant,You can get all the information contained for free from various sources on the web. I'm sorry I didn't read the reviews before I bought.
3,Average murder mystery,"This is my first book by Michael Prescott, and although I was not dissappointed, I do not think it lived up to the hype on the cover. It is not a bad book, and it some places it the plot gets quite tense. Good story line, average characters that we have seen before add up to a mediocre book. I have a couple of other books by Mr. Prescott that I hope are more interesting."
3,How Fletcher Was Hatched,The condition of this book was less desirable than I expected from the description. It had scribbles that a child had done throughout and the jacket was aged as if lying in the sun.
5,Better than synthetic,This is a great base layer. It's very soft and not rough at all. I wear it under my jeans during the winter and it keeps me very warm. I word it during a snowboarding trip and I was cozy and warm during the whole trip.
4,antiques,"I saw Bill's main street hardware store on your show, and would like to know the adress to go and have a look around. GGGreat stuff, You can reach me at the email adress. Roger"
2,Well here are only 8 episodes out of the 26 for $2.00 a piece.,"They are ok episodes, and they are the first 8:One Pony TownPsychic PickingsEasy RidersGetting the BootSmooth OperatorsGordon's Gold MineBuddy's Booby TrapArt of the DealAmerican Pickers is entertaining, but not $2.00 an episode entertaining. (I mean these were paid for when they aired by advertising, and now it's just icing on the cake income, and you want $2.00 an episode!!)I rented the first season, and thought ""That was cool, I'll buy the 2nd"", and then I get ripped off. (I mean at least the season 1 DVD was 12 episodes and a complete season).Volume 2 (very clever ""Volume"" instead of ""Season"")So clever that I won't be buying any more seasons, I mean ""volumes"".The show is good, but whoever was in charge of ""bundling"" this product for retail sale, and decided to not only put 8 out of the 26 episodes, but try to charge $16 for it as well, needs to be fired! I hope you enjoyed my $16, it's the last of my money you will be seeing."
2,Just OK,"The CPR section was well done, and I'm sure I'll watch it several times. But I expected more demonstrations about emergencies. After all, that is the power of video vs a book or magazine article. Instead, the information was delivered in a sit down interview format - very disappointing. It was also less detailed than a small book on home childproofing that I have. I didn't learn anything new. In my opinion, definitely not worth the cost."
2,Lacking in Literary Merit,"It is often said that history is written by those who win it. In Joel Martin's Sacred Revolt, the effort is made to stem the tide of assumption, broad generalization, and one-sided commentary of Southeastern American history. Unfortunately, this noble idea is unattainable in a historical monograph that falls prey to the same falliabilities as the histories it critiques. Due to the author being raised in the South,( born in Opelika, Alabama several miles from the actual site of the Battle of Horseshoe Bend of 1814) he is biased toward the subject. Martin's quest for the redemption of this particular piece of history is influenced greatly by his own beliefs. Interpreting, and thereby changing, history to suit his own needs makes this piece uncomfortably similar to the works it condemns. All this in additiion to an editor who seems to have given up half way through, has the reader questioning whether or not the author ever enrolled in English 101."
2,You get what you pay for,"Well great price for this keyboard. BUT the one I recieved new out of the box already had a problem with the enter key being stuck periodically. Scrubbed it down and it still does it. Not to mention I dislike that ""power"" button on top, accidently hit that many a time. Anyway you get what you pay for, be warned."
3,usb keyboard,the keyboard was not what i expected the keys was to close togetjer that i keep getting everything wrong when i keyed so i went out and got me another keyboad thanks for asking
1,Don't Bother,I only spent $8.99 for this product so I am not even going to bother returning it because I'll almost that amount in shipping. It is poor quality. Very noisy and click-y. You have to push down hard on the buttons for it to type. There are some buttons that are not in their standard place so it's causing me to make mistakes and slowing me down while typing.Bought a new keyboard and had to spend a little more money. Will be donating this one. It's awful.
1,great paper weight,"have you ever seen those replica guns, that look real but dont work, evidently they have keyboards the same way"
5,great first doll,"I bought this doll to switch out an older version that was getting worn from a couple years of well-loved play. Unfortunately for me, it wasn't an exact match- this one has pink on the cheeks & my older one did not.But the girls continue to love this soft, huggable doll. No plastic, no small parts. A mommy favorite."
4,Helped me to get 6 college credits and skip Eng 101,"I had originally got this book as just a refresher for my college placement exams in Math and English, I have been out of school for 20 years and knew I had forgotten alot. After reviewing the English section and scoring 81 on the practice exam I decided to attempt to take the CLEP test. I ened up scoring 62 on the actual CLEP. I think this book is a little outdated though. I took the all multiple choice version and it was not split into two sections, it was one 90 question section and you had 90 minutes to cmplete it. The questions in the book where a little easier than the actual test but the information in the study section covered pretty much everything on the test. I also used the REA books to study along with this one, I think that this is a fairly straightforward test and with the help of thes books can be passed by anyone willing to put in a few hours of study time."
1,AWFUL SHIPPING,Never buy from amazon. At least i wont ever again. payed for the best shipping on october 5th. its the 14th now and my item STILL HAS NOT ARIVED. its in NJ. been there for 3 days now. And amazon didnt even ship it out till the 10th of october!!! A DAY AFTER THERE ESTIMATE OF IT GETTING TO ME!Amazon is the worst site to buy anything.
5,"MLCS Traditional Table Edge Router Bit 1/2"" Shank","I purchased this router bit for an Entertainment Center I was making and wanted the routered edge to be the focal point of the Project - I was not dissapointed, the router bit worked very well. The Project was made out of Hard Maple and it cut a perfect edge. The order arrived very quickly and was exactly as decribed - I would buy from this company again."
5,"Easy Spirit Women's Ontime Mule,Black,9 M","Easy spirits are the only shoes I buy, my feet feel comfortable. I would never buy anything but easy spirit!"
5,Really Great Product!!,"I was using Crystal Reports 7 and upgraded to this version. The exported reports are improved over the previous version and it now includes Adobe Acrobat, along with Excel, HTML, Word, RTF, and text. It was easy to create and integrate the reports into my existing database programs I created with Microsoft Visual Studio. There is an extensive library of functions to use in producing professional looking and useful reports. Now you can choose whether to use the Crystal Reports programming language or Basic programming language. This is a very powerful tool and will pay for itself in time saved and customer satisfaction."
3,Does not match picture,"OK. Was planning on receiving the orange Florida hat with the gator on the front (like the picture). Instead received the orange Florida hat with the ""F"" on the front. Seems like Amazon has an issue matching the pictures with the orders on this one(see additional comments). Nice hat though. Husband likes it regardless."
3,Question,How could Sadie Earp (AKA Josie) have told Mrs Beesen of Wyatt's indiscrestions in 1954 when she died 10 years earlier?
3,"""The Lies and half-truths Behind the Legend.""","Another biographer once wrote that (paraphrase), ""...a biographer often reveals almost as much about himself as he reveals about his subject.""Tefertiller's seems to prove that statement in abundance.Buy it used and spend as little for it as possible and judge for yourself."
1,Big disappointment,"The charge Time is terrible, had to go out and buy a electric and several extension cords. Waste of money"
4,satisfied,"Very satisfied. Lock is long enough to lock bike to even small trees without much pulling. It's sturdy, but not too heavy. It lock and unlooks easily and smoothly."
2,My bike was stolen,"I live on a college campus where bike theft is quite common. I bought this lock so I wouldn't have to worry about going outside to find my bike was stolen. Not even a year after getting this (and a new bike after the last one was stolen) my new bike and lock were stolen. Unfortunately, nothing was left, so I have absolutely no clue how the bike was stolen. Lock seemed very solid and virtually indestructible (or at least not worth the time to destroy)."
4,Tough but heavy,"The lock seems very solid, but in consequence, it's quite heavy and not easily shifted to adjust for obstacles. You need to have a straight shot for the cable, because it's not going to twist very easily. But I guess that's the price you pay for having a cable that's hard to cut through."
3,Not needed...,"I suppose a biography on Bukowski is only good in the fact that it validates what Bukoski has written of himself. If you every want to know about Bukowski, beyond his stories, I recommend checking out ""Sunlight, Here I Am"" which is a collection of interviews. In these, you learn a lot about Bukowski. I will warn you, Bikowski was amazingly consistant, and his responses are always say the same thing... consequently, the interviews can be informative.This is a good biography though, but its shot down by its subject itself, who did not hide his life from the public. In fact, he rarely wrote about something other than his day-to-day."
2,Plagued By Buyers Remorse,"I suppose I deserve this. I bought this book at the behest of a Barnes and Noble employee. She said it was the best Bukowski biography she's read. Well, I found the book less than agreeable and I am now suffering through a severe case of buyer's remorse. Corporate literati ...strike again.Since I already have Ham On Rye, Post Office, South Of No North, and numerous volumes of Bukowski poetry, this biography really is obsolete. It seems like Cherkovski pasted together snippets of the Bukowski collection, and added some of his own limited insights, placed the whole conglomeration between a cover and shipped it off to market.Anyone who has read even a limited amount of Bukowski's work will find nothing new in this biography. Save your money and purchase Buk's poetry. I recommend Bone Palace Ballet, or The Night Torn Made With Footsteps."
3,Average,"Replaced stock 2003 Audi A4 brake pads at all four corners with Hawk Performance Ceramic brake pads about 3 weeks ago. I also replaced my stock rotors at the same time with a higher performance rotor and was expecting a significant increase in braking. Unfortunately, after 3 weeks (1,500 miles) of use, I can tell no difference from the stock set up. Not to say that that is bad, the stock set up was excellent. I was just expecting better than stock. We will see with more time."
3,Missed the Point,"An interesting book which will doubtless stir up some heated discussions among history buffs, if not revisionists. Far from being objective, the attempt to sort out myth and reality is drawn from quotes provided by the recollections of the Waffen-SS themselves. I would not expect their accounts to be anything less than noble, teary-eyed memories. It is very fuzzy history when we suggest that a political military wing which represented and defended a philosophy that ultimately destroyed a great nation in 1945 had some type of ""honor' associated with it. Their loyalty was not a military loyalty to a nation but a political loyalty to one man..."
2,Professional carpenter,"I am a professional millwork installer and needed a second drill on the job. I saw this drill at a local store and thought I would buy it for the low price of $89.00 just to have it. What a mistake! After three months I decided to give it to a new carpenter as a ""starter"" drill. If you are a homeowner who uses a drill once a week maybe this is a good drill. All other professionals, I wouldnt even spend the money to have it in your gangbox as a reserve."
5,A classic with a healthier twist,"The kids love the game and the cute game pieces -- when wrong ones were shipped with our game, the company was GREAT and very responsive to our needs. Healthy twist on a classic game makes kids think, yet feel comfortable knowing the general gist of the game."
1,boring,"Past page 100 we still had heard virtually no dialogue. Nearly the entire story is revealed through a third-person description of Lindy's thoughts, and there is, thus, a huge distance between the readers and the characters and events of the story. The writing is pretty and nuanced, but getting through it is like navigating a poetic slurry, and going nowhere fast."
3,No Sin,While this was a selection for our Bclub.Sin brought out a lot of discussions !Especially with the the viewpoints dealing with Sin and Nedra !Realizing Sin was undercover I could not excuse him from running out on her especially in her time of need ! He left her to face the demon of the church by herself . Just because she's the minister does not remove her from sin .We are all human and make mistakes ! None of us are perfect and we do fall . She was human and yes made mistakes too! Thinking about it was falling in love really such a sin ! Both or them were single and confess their love to each other ! Who knew he would run being undercover ? He who is without sin cast the first stone ? We all sin even the messenger .The other members of the bclub rate Sin higher than I did !We had a great time discussing Sin (his leaving udercover) and and sin ! A good book for discussion !
2,Travels in a strange state,"Expecting another light-hearted rollicking bike adventure about Josies travels in the USA, I must say I was dissapointed by her continually noting the Negative. I have travelled much of the same areas but do not choose to dwell on the seamier and moribund aspects of life. I also felt like she was rushing to finish this book with hardly a mention of the last few thousand miles. I did appreciate her cute maps and drawings throughout the book."
4,Perfectly Sweet,"Hope is the Merridew every expects to land the fish. No less than a Duke and the big wedding are expected. Of course, those plans go askew or we wouldn't have a novel. It's a fun romp that couldn't happen without someone to come along to fall for the dowdy Lady in gray. I didn't quite see how that happened although you see it coming. But why? We don't really care because we want Hope's romance to work. Still, would the finest Diamond of the Merridew Diamonds really be so forward. Hmm. You decide."
4,2nd story about the Merridew Sisters,What a fun quick historical romance. Sebastian has be reunitied with his two younger sisters and is need for his wife. Sebastian takes off to London to find the perfect wife. He finds the perfect mother but is she the perfect wife. Hope Merridew is a great character and Sebastian has such a big heart.
1,I thought it was only me...,"I seriously thought I put this toy together all wrong, called the Little Tikes company and expressed my concern about the wobbliness, the toys being either not there or weirdly sharp for a baby. The rep on the phone immediately sent me out a new one, which was awesome. Same deal though!So the company as a whole is great, seriously amazing! The toy though is not so great. It is wobbly, no matter what position you put it in (and good luck changing the positions!). The toys are sharp even for plastic.Basically my 21 month old and 7 month old won't look or play with it for more than a minute, rather my older baby uses it to attempt to climb!I'd stick with Little Tikes anyway, just not recommend this particular toy!:)"
3,Not much to it,"I bought this toy for my son who loves sound and spinning parts of toys. The fish in the middle spins, which he likes, but the sounds the toy makes are limited and poor quality. Also, the only buttons or things that activate music on the toy are the fish in the middle, a fish on the right, a button on the right and the dangling crab. There is nothing on the left side that can activate the toy. I'm not sure if they designed this so kids only use their right hand. Kind of strange. The biggest disappointment is the lack of variety in the sounds and music that it plays."
3,Exactly what I expected,"My 2 month old likes to watch the lights blink and hear the songs play when I push different buttons. She follows my hands with here eyes and smiles as she observes cause and effect. She tries to reach the dangling toys and occassionallt hits them. These toys are hard and I may remove them for saftey. Putting the toy together is bit tricky. Once the face is in the desired position, the two big plastic bolts need to be pushed inward hard so that they snap all the way. Once this was done it was very stable. This was exactly what I wanted for my child; Something she could look at, reach for and wiggle under."
2,My son got bored with it very fast,"It doesn't have alot of activity, and my son got bored fast. He had it for a couple of days then didn't really want anything to do with it. Money better spent on other toys I think."
2,Too high,"I bought this so my 4 month old could entertain himself for a few mintues on his back. He cannot reach any of the buttons, spinners, etc. The two dangling toys he can reach, he pulled off immediately. I will be returning this today."
5,the flock,I saw this band around 1970.they were just as good live as on record.They warmed up for the who.You will like it but your wife won't
2,DX: Purely ponderous drudgery :-(,"The author frequently rhetorically contradicts himself. Content information is shallow historically and theologically, and at times is in error. The 38 pages of statistics at the end of the book are wanting and appear to be just filler to increase the size of the book. Not very scholarly.For more concise, un-biased, information on the history, theology and sociology of Messianic Judaism I highly recommend Carol Harris-Shapiro's book, ""Messianic Judaism, A Rabbi's Journey through Religious Change in America."" Rabbi Harris-Shapiro gives a more detailed and concise overview."
2,Okay but prefer the original.,"It's nice to finally have a soundtrack to the movie, but I wish it had been the original music or at least included the beats that were in the movie during the dance scenes. I'd rather rip the soundtrack from the DVD or even buy a soundtrack ripped from the DVD then buy one with new voices that really don't capture the movie or the 80s. I can understand that for a 15 year old her voice is very good, but she doesn't seem to have that depth or range that would be nice with this movies soundtrack. It sort of sounds like she couldn't hit the note right in some places so they tried to drown it out through the filters and it just sounds bad.Hopefully the original soundtrack will come out, if not, I'll just stick with the movie."
4,yupyup,these boot are awesome! i got a size 10 and they look small but they fit perfectly. btw the point isn't that pointy as it looks in the pic but it wasn't a big deal to me:)
2,Just didn't like them,Nine West Shoes usually fit me very well but these boots just didn't look right on my feet. I sent them back.
1,Piece of J-U-N-K!,"I bought this lamp for my new apartment and instantly loved it. After two months the lamp started to malfunction. The switch seems as if it is stripped. The switch won't turn the lamp on or off, it just keeps on turning!!! Now I have to plug and unplug my lamp just to get it to work. Sometimes I get lucky and the switch will advance to the next setting, but nothing further! Nothing else works this way in my house and it makes me very uncomfortable! I knew better than to toss my receipt, because now target won't return it. Target cannot find my receipt in the system (for a receipt look up)and the manufacturer requested that I ship to Miami at my own expense. I was told that that I could receive a sample model that they may have on the floor. Thanks!"
1,Worked great for a few months then,"Read five star reviews from people who bought this coffee maker and had been using it a few weeks.Mine worked great too at the beginning. I would've thought what are all these people complaining about if I had read these reviews the first few months I had this coffee maker.Then all of a sudden I started experiencing the same thing as the others. I am careful not to fill it with too much water. I clean it. I carefully place the filter in it. Just as I have done for months when it worked.Now every time I make coffee I get about three cups. The rest is all over the counter along with grounds. I've had a Braun for decades, never had this problem. Bought this one at Target because I liked the thermal feature to keep the coffee warm. Never did keep the coffee hot. More like lukewarm, just as the other reviewers experienced."
1,Should have read all reviews!,"Mr. Coffee FTTX95 Programmable Pause N' Serve Coffeemaker with Thermal Carafe, BlackThought we had a winner, BUT six months later: Mr. Coffee has flooded the counter top four times (due to a poorly designed pot cap). Now the clock has failed, as has brew selector & other button switches. Electronics seem to have been shorted/wetted by excessive steam. Thermal pot works well, if pre-heated first. Other than that, we'll trash the nice looking unit and try another brand. Should have read all reviews before ordering!"
1,Looks impressive but ISN'T!,When you first open the box you find a sheet of paper stating that to keep the coffee hot you must first fill the carafe with hot water & let it sit for 5 minutes. Then empty the water and brew the coffee.?! You obviously can't do this if you use the delay brew timer function. The best you can hope for is luke warm coffee waiting for you in the morning. Also you have to press a button at the top of the handle to pour the coffee. The button is difficult/impossible to press so the coffee pours at a trickle. The only alternative is to remove the lid & pour. Or just don't buy the darned thing.
1,Don't waste your money,"""One Thing Leads to Another"" is not only a terrific song but a great dance tune, with a good driving beat. It's a standby of mine for DJ'ing. I had been looking for an extended mix (the original is just over three minutes) and thought I'd found it here. No such luck. These four remixes are a disaster, burying the original tune in a generic techno beat that is monotonous and interminable. DJ Boris and Doug Beck seem to have a reputation for their dance mixes, but their results here are masturbatory at best. Stay away."
2,A Little Too dramatic book,"I've bought this book because I love military aviation. Having read a lot of other books about the subject, after reading this I felt like I had watched a cheap Hollywood movie...I didn't like Mr. Aleshire writing style. He uses too many superlative words and after a while it becomes alittle boring. OK...they are the best, the super, the smartest, all the ""est"" stuff. But it is not necessary to repeat it all the time.I've learned many things, and I admire even more those who become Viper Drivers, but the writing style could be a little different..."
5,Great Photos,This book is by a member of the High Springs Art Coop who works as a photographer at the University of Florida. Only limited quantities are available at this time...I am really glad I grabbed one.
2,Not what I expected,"This book is jam-packed full of basic information that any martial artist already knows. Detailed descriptions on how to execute a kick or punch. I was hoping it would touch more on workout routines that I can incorporate. I felt like it was teaching a martial art instead of teaching how to prepare yourself physically for whatever style you may be practicing. There are a lot of good reviews on this book and that is why I purchased it, but it just wasn't what I was expecting."
5,Forgot how much I enjoyed this Group,"I forgot how much I enjoyed this group until I lent the CD to a friend the other week. The first time I heard them was in a small bar in Baltimore and they were great. I would have to agree with the other review by Linda that the song ""Hold On"" is by far my favorite also. It is really a shame that when this album first came out the radio stations only focused on the song Mary Xmess. This album is has so much more to offer."
3,"Good, not great","This is an okay book by Phillips, although not her best. I was looking forward to reading about grown-up Molly, who was introduced in ""It Had to Be You"", and Kevin (introduced in ""Nobody's Baby"". And while the book had the usual snappy dialogue of Phillips' novels, somehow the plot didn't grab me.The recent change in behavior for Kevin and the occasional pieces of bizarre behavior from Molly were never really explained, and didn't fit in their characters as developed.It wasn't a bad book or boring, it just wasn't engrossing. I'd check it out at the library or wait for paperback."
5,The Critics were wrong.,This book was very good. I had heard it reviewed and it was said that it was not up to Ms.Phillips best. I disagree. I absolutely recommend that you read this and I know you will enjoy it. All the characters have such depth. And as always she tied in the other books she has written which is what makes this great! I know we all like to revisit the characters she has invented. I can not wait for the next book!
2,not up to her usual standard,"I can't believe all the great reviews this book is getting! The beginning was just awful and these characters have no chemistry whatsoever!! The kids were fun, as were the characters out at the camp, but Dan and Phoebe were overbearing and irritating and the SKFSA plot device was weak and underused. This book was no where near as good as Dream a Little Dream, Kiss An Angel, and Heaven, Texas. I really hope Just Imagine is better, but after two duds in a row (First Lady was the other dud), I'm a little worried."
5,A Joyful Read!,"What a wonderful book this is, reminded me of the magic and joy of the movie ""Chocolat."" Molly, the heroine, must overcome tragedy to find love while Keven must learn to trust his emotions instead of turning them off. There are too many LOL (laugh out loud) moments to list here, but several times I cracked up and laughed so hard my sides hurt. The book also explores the power and importance of family. I loved the secondary love story with Liam. And the chapter openings using excerpts from Daphne the Bunny (a children's story that Molly writes as a children's author) are charming and delightful. This author just has such a special magical way of telling a story that is always fresh, always compelling, and always pulls you in until the very last page. I also loved seeing Phoebe and Dan from IT HAD TO BE YOU to see how their relationship had grown and their love had deepened. All in all a gem of a read! You finish reading this book and the feel-good glow stays with you long afterwards!"
2,horrible,terrible character chemistry and the main characters werent very likeable especially molly. she practically rapes the guy when hes asleep which just disgusted me. her attachment bordered on obsessive. ridiculous and a waste of money
5,Excellent!,"The 2003 NFC Champion Carolina Panthers ""Cardiac Cats"" is a must-own DVD for Panthers fans. Not only does it include an excellent recap of the teams 2003 season and post-season run, but it includes Super Bowl XXXVIII in its entirety (minus only commercials and ""dead time"" without any action on the field). The season included several memorable moments for the Panthers including a come-from-behind win against Jacksonville in week 1, three overtime road victories during the regular season, a second-overtime victory over St. Louis during the playoffs (in the 5th longest game in NFL history), and of coarse, the teams lone Super Bowl appearence."
4,Let Me Be Your Angel/I Want You Back...,Tiffany Evans does a fine rendition of the song made famous by Stacy Lattisaw.
5,Required Reading,"When you ask the question ""How do I get my business to the next level?"" In reality you first need to understand the answer to the silent question ""Where am I now and what is the next level?"" This book provideds thousands of dollars worth of professional consulting insight and is required reading for any financial professional who wants to be considered a financial professional."
5,A must read....,"This book was very enjoyable & easy to read. I had read it when it first came out & again this week & would recommend it to Trek fan's & to those who just don't ""get it""!"
4,Typical Takahashi Humor At Large!,"Another funny video of Ranma 1/2! Using a magic mirror from Happosai, Ranma tries to go back in time, but instead goes foward to a future where Ryoga is married to Akane! That kind of distrubed me, especially what happens to their kids when splashed with cold water...and the second episode features Ukyo becoming more in touch with her feminine side! Since Ukyo's my fav character, I really enjoyed the second ep! This is a good buy for any Ranma fan."
2,Doesn't explain anything,"The reason I wanted to see this film is because I was under the impression that it offered some sort of spiritual wisdom. I have not read the book yet, but the movie just basically followed the author through his progression from homeless to author. I did like how they portrayed his homelessness. It seemed very real and I really felt for him. However, there wasn't nearly enough dialogue. There were issues that were left unexplained, and it almost seems to portray the author as some sort of prophet who actually heard the booming voice of God from above speak to him directly and he just ""knew"" about the woman in the book signing who lost her son... It just seemed a bit too theatrical and unrealistic, which made me not like the film."
1,Conversations with God,"Very dissapointed, nothing to do with the book. It was not worth the money I paid."
5,It's a good online buying experience,"After I ordered the book, I got response form the seller. And I got the book in few days. I think it's a good online buying experience. Thank You!"
4,Intriguing,"This book is written in a very balanced way. The author is not on any sides. It documents the real-life story of a mentally disturbed woman who organises a dinner party for a group of friends, and announces to them that she plans to murder her boyfriend. No one takes her seriously, but she puts rohypnol in his coffee which knocks him out, then gives him a heroin overdose. When he is still alive 2 days later, she calls an ambulance to try and save him.Well written and researched."
4,A gem of a little book,"A book about two best friends about to be separated by miles and time is a definite catch for me to read. And it's an unforgettable read. When the two girls discovered a mermaid at the bottom of a pool, the girls (Claire and Hailey) did everything they could to help Aquamarine meet her true love, a boy named Ray.It is a whimiscal & delightful read. It's a wonderful little book to add to everyone's library. Hoffman turns an old legend into modern day prose ~~ but the reader will fall in love with the characters and the siren song of the mermaid."
2,Unhappy Customer in my House,"My daughter saw the movie and *loved* it. She pestered me until I bought her the book. She waited with high hopes for two whole days for it to arrive. She was overjoyed when it arrived. Fifteen minutes later she finished the book and said, ""I hate it. It stinks.""The book is short and nothing like the movie. Her advice? Movie is better.She is an avid reader and loves books, so this book has NOT earned high praise."
3,My Comment,"Aquamarine was a fun, enjoyable and easy book to read. I was fond of Claire's and Hailey's friendship. It was intresting how the two of them connected and yet were so different. It was sad that Corpi (the beach park)was going to be torn down. With that Claire and Hailey were the only customers. The way Aquamarine was found was very unique. And it is a good thing she made it to the ocean. The ending has not much of a twist but wants you to read more, even though the book has ended."
2,I Didn't Warm Up to This Oven,"Two main problems with this oven.1. It heats slow and takes forever to toast. Previous oven would toast 2 slices in about 4 minutes. I can make an omlette, cook it and eat a portion of it, before this one finishes toasting. Start toast, take nap, make omlette. That has become my routine.2. The convection does not work the way it should. My pizza came out more evenly cooked in my regular old Black & Decker.It's undepowered for it's size. It also tends to rattle due to the convection fan unless you set the door just the right way.Don't buy it. If you want soemthing cheap, stick to Black & Decker."
3,worry no more about leaving your car under a hot sun with this! thought storage issues are there when not in use.,"when i got this i never thought that storing it will be an issue, when going out with the family in my RAV4 its hard to just roll it and keep it in the back as the back seats are occupied already and i wish it had like some better idea then just rolling it for storage, even after rolling it hard it takes a big space and needs to be stored in the back of the back seats which means i would sometimes need to get out of the car to get it when parking."
3,hard to store,"The material is really thick and when its stored, takes up to much space. Could have designed it to fold like a map.Good but could be improved."
3,Ok for the price,"I ordered 12 knobs for cabinets in my garage. 6 had small blemishes, most around the small of the knob, not very noticable. Had they been for inside my home, I would have sent them back. For the price they aren't bad."
3,"Good basic video, but there's better...","Got this one and another for my wife. This was the first one we watched. She's a complete beginner, and thought it was pretty good. It has a lot of wasted time in the beginning of both videos, but the instruction is solid."
5,Real Flava,"WHAT!!!!!!!!???????? This cd is being offered new for as little as $3.00? This collection is a true classic from 1993 with tracks that still bump 'til this day. The title track is one of the greatest posse cuts of all time featuring Phife Dawg of A Tribe called Quest, Blacksheep, Freddie Foxxx, D-Nice, Naughty By Nature, Fu-Shnickens as well as other popular artists. The introduction of Zhane was made here with ""Hey Mr. DJ"" and D-Nice drops one of his best songs on this album.You also got Apache, Queen latifah (Co-C.E.O. of Flava unit), Benzino (During his Almighty R.S.O. days), The Rotten Rascals (a group which features Kay-Gee's younger brother), Latee, Nikki D., and lots more.This compilation is a forgotten gem that should be put in the collections of hip hop classics and not disregarded as dump bin fodder. So if you want some real classic hip hop flava- buy this cd while the price is as low as it is before these sellers figure out what they have. PEACE"
5,My son's favorite toy!!!,"This is my son's favorite toy. He absolutely loves it, and it goes with us everywhere. He loves watching TV while jumping in it. And loves the colors when they light up as he jumps."
4,Excellent low-priced Oolong,"I have been considered by friends as a ""tea snob"". I've been known to purchase loose-leaf gourmet teas priced at $20/lb and well beyond. Those teas -- including many of the fine gourmet Oolongs available -- can, when properly prepared, provide you with a special and worthwhile experience.That said, Foojoy China Classic Oolong is the flavor you've come to associate with American Chinese restaurants. Considering its flavor and price, this product constitutes a value difficult to beat. It has become part of my daily rotation, and I recommend it to any tea enthusiast looking for an everyday Oolong."
1,"Good band, bad album","I've been wanting to say this for awhile, and this album actually moved me to write. First, I'm a roots fanatic since the late 70's. I have more reggae CDs than most people have total CDs.This album is a great example taking a great roots groove as a back drop, and saying any pretentious cliche they feel like. There's no effort here - no art. It's a hollow empty shell of roots. This is common in a lot of reggae since the mid-90s. They apparently have nothing new to say here, and cling to the album-a-year conveyor.That said, Isreal Vibration is a great roots band, and I like track 3 on this album - Here I can ""feel"" them, into their music and having fun... the rest is just filler. Go check out ""Strenth of my life"" or ""Forever"" - These will demostrate the wonderful capabilities of the this roots singing group to sincerely lift and elate you."
2,Far too short...,"I'm a huge Packer fan and was looking forward to reliving the 2003 season that featured some great games. I guess I should have read the existing review and seen that it was only 20 minutes long. The fact that this is on DVD should have lent itself to the fact that there could have been a ton of great footage to show. Instead there is at most 45 seconds or so of highlights from the games... maybe one key play that made a difference. One of the most incredible games I've ever seen, the one after Brett's father died, got little more coverage than any other game. You got to see Brett's touchdown passes and about 10 seconds from a news conference. In addition, although no Packer fan wants to relive the dreaded 4th and 26, there were no highlights at all from the final game against the Eagles. Overall I expected a much more in-depth view of the 2003-04 season and was very disappointed."
5,OMG,"thiz buk iz soooooo gud! i got in2 yal, vasir, prinston, and harvard and even u pen! thiz book will help u w/ ur college serch becuz itz fun and informitiv and it haz everything u need 2 suceed so by it or go 2 comunitee and hav no carear!o i think therz a cuple comunitey in thr 2.i like thiz book and want the otherz becuz my little sister in the 6th grad and wants to go 2 havard."
3,An Alright Book,"Being almost midway through highschool, I thought it'd be wise to begin looking at options for college. The book is helpful in that it includes thorough information about life on campus, the student body, and admissions statistics. I found many of the ratings confusing, such as the educational and financial ratings. I wasn't sure what they were comparing these schools to. Overall, the book was a great investment. However, I will buy a different book for 2006."
5,Best book on direct selling i have ever looked at.,"This title is a must for anyone who works door to door or in B2B. Its loaded with tried & tested tips & tricks that work...i can vouch to that. The author is a born salesman, and his tactics are brilliant..very good book."
1,Stupid is as stupid does!!!,"If you can think of everything you don't like about a salesperson, this is the guy who stopped selling and is now writing books. He is so unethical I only got half way through the book and was wishing I could get my money back. He says things like inflate the price and then give them a discount so they will be happy and think they got a deal and all the time they are paying regular price. There are many other examples of unethical behaviour but really from my personal perspective, the book would have been better off left as a tree. Keep your money in your pocket on this one."
1,Rotten old stinking old stud finder,"What a rip, this product is worthless do not waste your money.After several hours trying to find a stud with this thing I finally found one stud but I think I just got lucky.My wife thought I was doing something wrong so she tried and after a while she said ""throw it in the trash""."
1,This stud finder does not work!,This stud finder does not work. It constantly says there is a stud when there isn't.
1,0 Stars,"I cannot believe why or how MTU sells Poplaski's book to us? this is the worst book ever. Noone understood anything.I hate when a person publishes his/her irrelevant, useless book and sells us just to earn money. We all are giving importance in education, but Poplaswki only cares about business, he only cares how much he will sell and put in his pocket.All Computer science students will agree that this book is useless and not even worth to pay $5.stay away from this book!!!"
3,I never was sure...,"..., which, players or fans, got the utmost stupidity, but I thank John Huston for showing they're about even. Of course, although here soccer is used for demonstration, but it can apply to any crap filling stadiums with subhumans who shouldn't have any rights whatsoever...."
5,Excellent football and excellent movie,"For the time that this movie was made it has one of the best visuale effects that i have witnessed in a long time. It was one of the most entertaining and intrigueing movies that i have witnessed in a while. It really captured the moment of the games.Although the movie was great i still think that they should have stuck to more of the historical accuracy of the Dynamo team in Kiev,Ukraine."
5,great mpvie,"I really enjoyed this movie, I have allowed others to watch it and they have also enjoyed it too. If i get permission from my administrators, I will show it to my soccer teams."
5,A great historical adventure story,"After having read the prologue (telling the Legend of the Broken Note) many years ago, I was very, very glad to see the book reissued so that I could read the whole story. It is a great adventure tale, filled with interesting characters and an intriguing story line. It does require the reader's attention and is not a watered down ""chapter book"". Try it and like it! (Don't be put off by the comments of 'boring', I suspect that is because there is no merchandising tie-in to this book, no video game, etc.) This is swashbuckling historical fiction for youth at it's best."
4,Review of Purchase of Book Practical Research,"Book received in condition advertised. Book arrived when expected, price was better then campus book store. Was provided with contacts e-mail and phone to report complaints/problems. Very satisfied with purchase, will contact Amazon and supplier for future textbook purchases."
2,Overrated Lounge singer.....,"Years ago, while in my early teens I heard Buddy's version of Mr. Lonely. I bought the 45 on the Epic label. I really liked the song and still think his version is much better than Bobby Vinton's even though Vinton wrote it. I immediately started listening for more of Buddy's works. His voiceis amazing I agree, however he never wanted to use it. His renditions, of some of the songs like,Around the World, Roses of Picardy and It had Better Be Tonight, still make me cringe.He sounds like Bill Murray doing the Lounge singer act on SNL.I'm sorry but Buddy never lived up to his abilities as a Singer. Frank, Dean, Sammy, Tony never had anything to worry about."
2,Another French band,Again a record that got rave reviews in France but really it shows again that the French will never be able to produce really great music.They remain basically too obsessed with lyrics and pay too little attention to production and musicianship. Again I wanted to like this one but it is one big disappointment. Nice cover though.
5,wire set,"As for most things on amazon when it comes to automotive parts, do some of your own research to verify parts that will work on your car. After a little side work I found these that would fit our explorer. Autolite is a good brand, and I was not disappointed with the product. As for most replacement wires, not all the new ones in the box will match exactly to the length of the old ones. These were no exception, but still the quality and fit were just as the local parts store. With the super saving ( no cost) shipping, less that the parts store..........always a good thing to save a little cash."
4,mane yall juss hatin on dis cd cuz its undaground,this cd's tight as helldaz all i can sayget itpeace
2,Not For Serious Mystery Writers.,"It is only 64-page long with images largely occupying every single page.It is probably enough for causal writers who would like to try writing a mystery story once in a while, but for serious writers who want to be published, this isn't one of the best sources to go for. There are far better books attacking this topic thoroughly. such asTelling Lies for Fun & Profit: A Manual for Fiction WritersandHow to Write Killer Fiction: The Funhouse of Mystery & the Roller Coaster of Suspense."
5,too bad,it sucks that these guys aren't together anymore. this cd is great. granted it took me over a year before i finally listened to the whole thing. if only they could have gotten more radio play. but things are the way they are. a shame really. all the talent in this band. i highly recomend this cd to anyone who loves good natured hard rock. sure there are some slower songs but overall a great cd.
3,"Lot of money for a piece of plastic, but I'm HAPPY anyways","The company itself is great. Fast shipping, great customer service, and a free catalog full of great stuff shipped with the order. Itself einsteins face is a bit of a let down, yes the effect works great...but it isn't untill you make a display setting or do something with lighting that this thing comes alive! Out of the box just so so. It was accuratly described, I knew what I was getting... :) I would definatly shop at Arbor again!!If you want this, this is the lowest price/place around and I'm happy I purchased this. Your out of your mind however if you purchase this elsewheere...for 60 bucks + and there are plenty of on line places that are more than happy to take your money!"
5,This review will tell how good Baby-Sitters on Board is,This book was the best book I've read in a long time.Realistic stuff happend on board and in Disney World. Keep up the great work Ann. I love all of your books I read them all the time!
2,Why?,"It is usually acceptable to add music to a soundtrack that did not originally make it to the movie, but I find it difficult to accept a product with parts missing. ""You Don't Know Me"" for some reason was left out of this particular CD being replaced with a guitar rendition instead. While this version is alright, I had expected the vocal version as featured in the film and was of course disappointed that it did not appear. If your looking for that song as it was played in the movie, DO NOT BUY THIS CD, it will only break your heart."
4,"Looking for ""You Don't Know Me"" ?","I searched high and low for the song featured in this movie entitled: ""You Don't Know Me"". I originally searched all of Ray Charles' Albums. The only one I found was a garland 4 disc box set. Which is probably the same song from 1962.The original artist of the song is Eddy Arnold. You can find the song on his best hits album. I haven't lstened to either of these albums so I can't rate the songs on them."
3,Enlightening,"This book did an excellent job on describing the roles in which women took part in during the Civil War. Webb Garrison did an excellent job choosing women to write about. Both Southern and Northern women were talked about, showing readers that these women were not as different as they had thought they were."
5,What real scholarship should be,"This is a brilliant example of good scholarship. The book is impeccably researched. Of course there are conclusions that are open to debate, but it is difficult to find an area where you could fault the writer's logic. This is the standard work on a very complex subject, and will likely remain so. If only every historian was so objective and paid so much attention to detail, think of how much we would discover. Maybe I'm being too naive."
1,Not great for multiplayer,The multiplayer games are no fun. Hard to control. Wii Sports is way more fun for multiplayer. It would be better to save your money from buying monkeyball and buy bomberman '93 or wait for Wii Play.
2,A Waste of the Nintendo Wii's Possibilities,"Okay, so I've played only a handful of games so far for the Wii. Unfortunately, I wasted time and money on this one. I, like many of the other reviewers, feel that it simply did not live up to it's possibilities.The controls are my main complaint. It really doesn't register half of the movements you make in the mini games and that DOES get annoying. I believe that time and practice could make a few of the games playable, but, I need to emphasize A FEW.The main game is okay, the controls are definitely better than the mini game portion. However, I wanted this game primarily for the 2-4 player capabilities. The main game did not justify the $50.00 purchase for me.My overall impression and opinion is that this game needed more time in testing before they released it into the markets. I would ""maybe"" consider re-purchasing it for the main game when the price hits $20.00."
3,Takes getting used to,"The main game is a lot of fun, but isn't very long. The main focus is on the minigames which are hit or miss. The controls take some getting used to as this game is VERY sensitive to your movements. Once you figure out which minigames work best and which don't, it can be fun."
3,OK Game,"I really loved the SMB for the gamecube, but this one, while fun will give anyone sitting around you motion sickness if they watch the screen. The controls are clumsy and not very accurate. Also, after finishing each world, you have to sit through this credits screen that takes about 10 minutes before you can progress to the next level. That was a major ""fun kill"" right there. Rented - returned..."
2,Super Monkey Ball,"It's fun, but complicate too. You have to have a very good ability with the controller, additionally the game have 50 little games, but you have to configurate the control every time that you start a game, Horror....This game is not for little kids, maybe from 8+ age."
5,My kid's favorite game,"My girls are 11 and 13. They love this game. It's a challenge to get the ball through the different courses. The game also has mini games which you can play with two people. They enjoy using those with their friends. At first this seems challenging, but once you get the hang of it it's fun. They have tried this game for the DS and don't like it very much. The ball is hard to control on the DS and the screen is small. On the Wii the way you control the ball is just perfect and really makes use of the special control of the Wii."
1,This was the worst waste of 7 dollars,"This was the worst waste of seven dollars to rent a video game, ever! We returned it the same night we rented it! The play control was awful, and I agree with the review that said the wii sport's control is better. Way better. I would never pay full price for this. Matter of fact, I wouldn't buy it used either. If this is your first purchase into the Wii system, seriously consider something else. Rayman Raving Rabbids is way, way better if you are looking for fun minigames and a good introduction into the wii remote's method of control."
1,Too complicated,I bought this the day the Wii came out and played it several times and found it was boring and way to hard to control. We eventually sold it.
3,Lots of mini games but...,"I've only played a few of the multiplayer minigames, but having played Wii Sports, the method of interacting in some of the minigames here is a bit lacking. For instance, the bowling minigame seems much less intuitive than Wii Sports bowling. However, music and graphics are cute, though some of the minigames require a great deal of patience."
1,Meaningless book,This book is written as a novel and contains very few useful facts. I am very sorry that I ever bought this book
3,ok,I bought these monkeys for my classroom. I was disappointed in the quality. I had to tape the air plugs shut because they kept popping open.
1,knockoff,"The content of the e-book might have been good or even perfect, but by the way it was presented. It was a complete knockoff, non-sense, without creativeness. To explain, it was presented in HTML format, some of the links were broken and to think you had used the most interactive, graphically rich format you should have included some animations, sounds, or even flash movies. Not just pixelated pictures. Even the font used was timesnew roman regular, the default font for all HTML editors even for notepad! If you were maintaining the concept of a plain book. Maybe A visually riched or a digitally enhanced cover page would have added a lot. Even the CD had no jewel case let alone a label and the CD that was used was a standard Blank CD you can by in any computer store the brand was seen beneath the cd label.Find another way to make a living because you will be loosing alot of customers this way.I gave it 1 star because the script needed the form to be filled up."
4,Enjoyable,"I enjoyed this book, I was hoping for a book with a bit more meat in it so to speak. But found that it was a good book for a quick guide to the festivals. I would recommend this book to anyone who is new to the understanding of the fullfillment of the festival feasts and there significance when applied to Jesus' past (Yeshua ben Joseph) and to His future (Yeshua ben David) here on earth."
2,Definitely not worth the money.,"How frustrating to pay for 3 books to get a story that really isn't worth a single book. Definitely agree with the others that this was too drawn out. In fact, many times it seems things are thrown in JUST to link them to other Trek references. I'm never a big fan of stories that do this, try to pull in characters and situations we've already seen, other than the essentials (I guess it's supposed to make the author look clever)...but this series did it so much I wanted to scream. In fact, I can't think of single character or plot device that was completely original and din't have SOME reference to something else in the Trek universe.Having said that, there were things to like about the books, so I give it 2 stars...not totally awful, but not sure it'd be worth reading when you have other choices."
2,An Endurance Test.,Robert Ludlum doesn't realize that humans have brains. This book could have been written in about 200 pages and been a lot more readable. You already know how the book will end when you start to read it. You ask yourself if you really want to devote your valuable time to this marathon of words. If this was a movie it would have to last for a few hours. It didn't keep me awake like one reviewer promised it would. When I got done with it I had an urge to read Edgar Allen Poe and enjoy a real writer.
5,PROTECTING OUR EYES!,"This is an easy to read guide to learning about our eyes and how to safeguard our vision. This compact thirty-nine page phamplet offers insight into Macular Degeneration, Cataracts, Glaucoma, Diabetic Retinopathy, Night Blindness, ""Snow"" Blindness, Antioxidants, Bilberry, Lutein, and nuturing properties contained in some foods.Author Beth M. Ley, Ph.D, has given us the first step, the basics, in helping us to help ourselves. I especially liked the chapter on foods. Spinach, collard greens, leeks, peas, kiwi fruit, zucchini, corn, grapes, kale, squash, broccoli. I knew about carrots but not the other veggies and fruits.Author Ley includes results of studies documenting those at risk for eye damage, and emphasizes that our eyes are our most delicate and sensitive organs. Protect them.Read the book. It is clear, informative, helpful."
2,Disappointing,"Compared to my memory of the 1974 version with Richard Chamberlain, something illusive was missing from this performance. I wish someone had the 1974 version so I could determine whether the difference is due to Chamberlain's perfomance, Branugh's performance, changes to the script, or my memory.Update ten years later : I finally FOUND a copy of the Chamberlain performance on tape and it was better than i remembered it. It was definately Chamberlain's performance, but also Eileen Atkins and ALL the other players. Somebody should put a version on DVD."
1,Happily N'ever After is RIGHT--especially if you watch this movie!,"I had really looked forward to this movie when I saw the previews. It seemed to have an interesting storyline and you couldn't tell yet how bad the animation was. Then, I saw it, and I sat in the theater aghast, appalled...well you get the idea. Anyway, Sarah What's her Name and her husband play the main characters and lend nothing to them. Ella is annoying and self-absorbed; Rick is whiny; and all the other characters completely forgettable. I can't believe that Sigourney Weaver, an amazing actress, stooped to participating in this!Animation is terrible, no charisma like in Shrek (it looks like someone made it in their basement).Okay, enough bashing. I would just avoid this movie and stick with Shrek, Disney movies, films like Wallace and Grommet and Flushed Away, or the live action version of Ella Enchanted."
4,fantasy fun,"This cartoon production is fun, has some learning points and a great children's flick that is enjoyable for adults, too."
4,very convenient little bowl,"I bought this bowl for my Bernese Mountain Dog Puppy. It packs up very small and is easy to carry around. It holds plenty of water. I haven't tried using it for food yet since he eats raw food. The only bad thing I can say is it doesn't stay perfectly open, sometimes it collapses in and spills water. But it is fine for outside use as long as you are okay with it spilling sometimes."
4,"Very pretty, excellent function, band too loose","I've had Pulsar watches in the past and they are durable and precise. This watch is very pretty but like most expansion bands, it is too loose. I'll take it to a jeweler to see if if they can take out some of the band."
4,Excellent for Very Short People,"This is a great desk. I love it. However, I am only 5'3"" tall. The keyboard tray on this desk is barely high enough for me to use. I have to sink my height-adjustable chair all the way down to make it work.There is room to move the keyboard tray higher if you are comfortable drilling your own holes. Or, the top of the desk is pretty low, so most people would be comfortable just having the keyboard on top of the desk."
1,STAY AWAY FROM AAA FURNITURE DISCOUNTS,"Ordered a desk on January 17th was delivered January 27 with the box ripped open and crushed on the corner.Ups took the desk back and said ""I refused the delivery"" and said nothing about the box being damaged.Ups must have tapped the box up and shipped it back. After many manyE-Mails I received a refund but they charged me $91.81 for nothing. AAA said nothing was wrong with the desk and charged for deliery and stocking fee.I was not going to receive a delivery when the box is damaged. The refund took almost two months. Amazon tried to help but too the side of AAA. I will never but anything from Amazon again. Better Business Bureau is next.STAY AWAY FROM AAA FURNITURE DISCOUNTS!!(ONLY HAS ONE STAR BECAUSE YOU CAN'T HAVE ""0"" STARS)"
3,Two left sides,"I had a carpenter put this together, and was glad I did. It came with two left panels, and no right panel. If I was building it myself I would have had to pack it up and wait until the replacement part arrived- instead he was able to adapt the left piece for me, and since the right side faces the wall you can't tell it's there. Also, as noted by someone else the keyboard tray is way too low, so I removed it. Still, for the money it's a nice desk"
4,pre pac maple desk,Excellent product ....came in great condition.. easy to put together...great for an adult or an older child 8 or 9 years old. The slide drawer could be a bit higher but can be adjusted by drilling a few holes higher.
5,The most revealing book ABOUT Truth,"This is the Book. Of course, it is not the Truth, because a book can only be about the Truth. But, truly, is the most clarifying and elevated explanation about who we are."
3,Almost as good as <Tyranny For You>,"I bought both of these back in 93',pretty good,but I think Tyranny For you was Front 242's best to date."
4,"A nice, sweet read","I quite liked this book. The premises behind it were nice and sweet. The story itself was quite sweet, if you disregarded the cheating fiance and the manipulative parents. But they too had a part to play in the awakening of Tess Sommerville. And Will Tremere, British hunk extraordinaire, was just what she needed. In fact he's sort of what I think we'd all imagine out perfect guy yo be like; kind, caring, considerate, hot, and kind to animals. Lol. :)But the best thing about this book is that it's a romance with a message, nothing to deep or dark, but it's extremely well written, making the book very enjoyable."
5,Get On Board,This is the best potty chair ever! My son is obsessed with trains and now with the Choo Choo Trainer. We have had it for a week and have not had even one accident. He can't wait to have to go to the bathroom again so he can use his new Choo Choo Trainer. Thank you Kolcraft for finally developing something that actually motivates toddlers to potty train.
5,We both love it!,"I bought this for my 20 month old son and we both love it. I haven't tried any other pottys so I don't know if he prefers this over something else, but I know that this potty is easy for him to get on and off, he can get comfortable easily and he loves the encouraging sounds that the potty makes. I like it because it is easy to take apart and reassemble to clean, we can use it on the regular toilet when it is time, it converts to a stepstool, and the stepstool top fits underneath the potty when it's not in use, so I don't have to look for a seperate place to store it. The only thing I would change would be for the deflector shield not to come off so easily. One thing my son loves to do is take it off as soon as he sits down. But other than that, I'm really satisfied!"
2,Not a great quality tie,"I know these are pretty inexpensive ties, but they are cheep quality the material just doesn't last long at all, and they seem to be very prone to snags."
3,Maybe he hadn't heard,I wonder why Mr. Logan failed to mention that the oak is the national tree of the United States.
1,"great for 2 months, then it's lousy","Bought one of these, and loved the features. Within a month, the unit started malfunctioning...leaking water, brewing half a pot, sneak a cup feature began to leak. Returned the unit for a replacement. After two months, I am having the same problems again with the replacement. You couldn't give me another one of these units...I am going to go buy something else."
3,Very Canadian-obscure words/names/places,"A love hate relationship with this collection. There is a brilliant Wizard of Oz themed puzzle in this book. Most of the puzzles are themed, though they don't tell you what the theme is. But there are many that have obscure (at least to me) Canadian terms, people and places. If you are from the great white north (where apparently these puzzles are from) you will probably enjoy this collection more. What/who are whist, war bonnet, tam oshanter, souwester, deer stalker, rondo, orpheus (all in same puzzle)? My cover did not have the word MENSA on it, though it has the same ISBN. Agree with others that the Atlantic collection far exceeds this book. If you are a die hard fan this book is still worth it since there is a shortage of even mediocre quality puzzles."
5,Old faithful product,This is an old reliable productfor that I have used for as long as it has been available (lots of years).
2,Authors argue that nurses are merely glorified housemaids!,"This pamphlet is a discussion of two historical periods: medieval times when females healers were branded as witches and burned at the stake, and the nineteenth century when women were systematically barred from medical studies. While the historical facts may be accurate, the difficulty is that the authors view medicine as the only viable role for women in the healthcare field. They quickly dismiss the role of nurses and other ancillary healthcare workers because they are not the bosses in the healthcare delivery system. Their goal is to convince the reader that until women dominate medicine, there is little that they can offer patients in their attempts to maintain health. Ardent feminists will enjoy this book. However, those who believe that there is more to maintaining or regaining health than pills and surgery will find it a denegration of the work of those who play other roles in healthcare delivery."
2,disappointing,I purchased this book looking for an historical perspective of women healers. Although this book does provide a history it is extremely biased towards the feminist idealogy. The book was written in the 70's and it shows with it's bias and underlying anger. The good thing about reading this is to realise how far women and the health system have come in the equality debate.
3,disappointed,I was disappointed that it was listed as a boardbook and the only thing that was board was the covers.This was my 10 year old's favorite book when he was little and his entire book was a boardbook.
4,wow!,"Kola Boof is an extravagantly talented writer. She writes with passionate abandon and imaginative brilliance. The African sequence that opens this book is astoundingly rich and enjoyable. The story of enslavement and degradation of these proud Africans is hard to read, and set down with wonderful empathy from someone who is not of those West African lineages but from the Sudan. Kola is also a splendid romance writer, which comes into view in the modern-day sequences here. I'm taking a point off for spelling errors (this book needs a copy editor) and some preachiness in the second half that could be left out but Kola is a daring and spectacular writer in this book."
2,Good action movie but hardly based on a true story,"I really enjoyed this movie from the start. The plot was excellent, built around a classic suspense script turning an ordinary man into a good-guy Hollywood hero. Actually, not only a hero, but the real Bruce Willis cliché type of a hero. The sad part, which none of the other reviwers seem to acknowledge, is that it's so painfully obvious not based on much truth. The story is just way too much Hollywood with probably no other sources than Yahias own. I would not bet any money whatsoever that even 10% of what happened on the screen is based on any real events. It didn't surprise me when I searched for Yahais story on the net and found that his account has been questioned by journalists from Guardian and BBC, and probably many others. This type of story just doesn't play out in real life."
3,The movie watered down the reality...,He was much more violent than he was portrayed in this movie. After reading about him the movie swept a lot under the carpet.
4,Most amazing!!,"I discovered Adam back in the early 80's, seeing the Antmusic video on MTV and other places. I imediately bought King's of the Wild Frontier, and loved it. To this day it is still one of my favorites. Shortly after buying that, I got my hands on the US version of Dirk, and was equally pleased with it. The one day, I ran across a cassette copy of the original Do It 1979 release, and snagged it. I thought it was so much better in ways, than the US version. I still have that cassette to this day. When this remaster came out a couple years back, I was THRILLED to see it was a remaster of the original version.The remastered CD is amazing, with much more clarity and energy than my cassette could provide. I love all eras of Ant Music, but the first two albums hold a nearer, dearer place in my mind."
4,Nice selection of holiday hits,"This is the follow up CD to the 16 most requested songs series that Sony/Columbia put out for Christmas. There are some rare selections here like Diahann Carroll's Do You Hear What I Hear?, Rosemary Clooney's Count Your Blessings and Doris Day's Toyland. Quite a few of these songs you've probably heard in stores and malls over the years while you're doing your holiday shopping. A nice trip back, musically. A detailed booklet provides info and insight into each of the songs as well."
1,Wolfe Shocker,"Wolfe had a terrible war. Between the excellence of Some Buried Caesar and The Silent Speaker, Stout wrote by far his four worst Wolfes- Over My Dead Body, Not Quite Dead Enough, Where There's a Will...and Black Orchids. I don't know what went wrong, he may have had other things on his mind. Don't bother with this one unless you're a serious addict."
5,Fabulous performance!,"I have this on cassette only and the sound is fabulous. Thisis the first and only item I have by Braff and I am very, veryimpressed with his tone, style and talent. I will be buying moreof his output of which there is an abundance."
4,one of the most underrated and ignored records ever,"Great music from beginning to end. Both Hall and Oates have grown and are doing their best work. Unfortunately, the record companies support the ""artist de jour"" and, as a result, many artists from prior eras get ignored. Certainly was the case here.""Philly Mood"" and the reworking of Marvin Gayes, ""Stop Loving Me/Stop Loving You"" are standouts.Tell me there's new work from Daryl Hall and I'm there."
4,In a Philly mood? You might just want this one.,"Daryl Hall still retains his dynamic, soulful voice, which continues to be one of the most beautiful instruments in pop-soul. This contemporary, yet timeless, slice of Philadelphia International soul is a must-buy for us Daryl Hall John Oates complete collectionists.The standout track is the magnificent ""I'm in a Philly Mood."" It is the perfect ""quiet storm"" style R & B ballad. While no other track comes close to scaling this heighth, they create a soulful atmosphere. You could even call it a ""Philly mood,"" if you were so inclined."
2,"Daryl CAN sing soul better than anyone, but why?","Best cuts are ""I'm In A Philly Mood"" and ""Stop Loving Me, Stop Loving You"". Good R&B; album such as it is but unless you're a collector, you're not missing much. The production is much too heavy for my taste. I've played this thing a grand total of twice all the way through since it came out and even tried to like it but it just doesn't do it. ""Three Hearts In The Happy Ending Machine"" remains the cream of the crop for Daryl Hall solo albums.I recommend the CD remixes of ""Stop Loving Me"", and ""Written In Stone"". The best track is on the import version of the CD in ""I've Finally Seen The Light""."
4,Into a Different World,"This book is informative about the lives of cloistered nuns. It is moving, and even humorous at times! You will enjoy this book, especially if you are a religious person."
3,GOod but not great***,bad brains great band i bought this cd recently and the lyrics are good but its not the greatest cd by bad brains. theres more ska than the usual hard riffs but still a good cd. kinda gets boring after a wile.i recomend u get BAD BRAINS LIVEor at least listen to I Against I before you turn this band down
5,Spectacular Photography of a truly extraordinary play,"If you do not have a chance to go to Germany this summer and see the passion play, this book is your one chance at a glimpse of a great tradition. This wonderful work, put on every ten years for the past 400, is the product of a small village in Germany where the locals play the parts of Christ's passion. The phtography captures as best as is possible the beauty and craftmanship of the production. ""Passion"" easily refers here to both the trails of Christ's earthly journey as well as the effort and style of the performers' work. The book is a very well done look at a play which is simply inspiring as good art really is."
1,Tried to grow twice with zero success.,"We followed the directions on the first disc and got nothing. So, we reread and followed them meticulously again. This time it sprouted, but just sort of got stuck at that stage. I wish I knew what we did wrong. I'm glad it didn't set me back too much."
4,A bargain . . . at a price,"Two hundred New York Times Sunday crosswords at a nickel apiece is a great deal. The book is loaded with the work of well-known as well as less well-known constructors. Most of the puzzles are quite challenging and interesting to work and there is an ample number of humorous concepts included in the batch.The drawback to the book - i.e., the ""price"" we pay for the publisher's generosity - is the lack of perforation and/or distance between the working areas and the binding. Having to write around curves on the top couple of lines across is a bit irksome.Yet, all in all, this book is a true bargain and well worth the cost and the minor inconvenience."
4,easy to follow instruction,"I like this video because it allows me to learn and practice Bikram Yoga at my own time. Being a busy working mom, I don't have time to go to Hot Yoga studios to practice it. I purchased this video after reading some the reviews. I too find it very helpful. I watch and learn the posts at my own time and pace. Practice it after my gym workout or at home before bed time. Although I am doing it in unheated enviorement, I still find it quite effective in releasing tensions in my neck and shoulder since I work in front of the computer all day."
3,e la solita storia..,"L'Arlesiana still has some good stuff to bring to us, and the most important one is the famous tenor aria, e la solita storia (lamento di Federico) , which is perhaps one of the most amazing tenor arias ever written.In this version, I think Peter Kelen doesn't do a bad job, he's not the best but he is pleasant to hear in a big part of the opera. He sounds quite sure in the top of his register and is not bad technically, not impressive though.About THE aria, I must say that Kelen sings it fine. I would recomend versions by BENIAMINO GIGLI, Tito Shipa, Giussepe di Stefano and I think Alfredo Kraus sang it quite well too.That's all I'll write for the moment.Bye!"
1,Over priced,I can buy the same pump on line at Summit Racing for $159.95. Where is your deal?Weiand 8215P Action Plus Polished Aluminum Mechanical Water Pump
1,Omar Sharif Bridge 2,"Terrible. Graphics so bad, cannot tell Spades and Clubs apart. Play even at the fastest speed is very very slow. Computer partner bids irregularly. Computer partner always leads a trump against a suit contract. Cannot take back erroneus bids. Does not hold a candle to the original Omar Sharif game."
2,late and damage goods,Took forever to get the tape and when I did get it was damage.But they give me a refund.
4,Kaboom rocks,My Kaboom was really a great surprise to me eventhough I was the one who researched and decided that's what I wanted. The full range of sound comming from this box makes you want to party. I would have liked it much more if it had an actual equalizer but that's because I like to adjust my sound to my liking continuously as oppose to using the canned preset equalizer settings.It's really a lot of fun.
2,It's OK at best,"I have been playing 8-Ball for almost 14 years and not to brag but I have a pretty good eye to hand coordination so I play the real game very good. I got this game becase I like playing games on my PC and since I also love playing pool, it seemed to make sense. Beautiful graffics, especially for a 2 year old game and the game plays smoothly on my a year and a half old gaming rig. There are a lot of game types to pick and fun to play for someone who has little or no knowledge of the games but for a seasoned player, it might seem like torture when even a simple shot takes almost a minute to line up and still miss despite your best efforts to make sure the shot was correctly lined up. The same shot in real life would be in the pocket in about 5-6secs. In my opinion, this gameshould be for fun only cause it does not compare to playing the real game. Also, I do not see how this game could possibly improve someone's real life pool game..."
4,Came back after all these Years,I really liked this product. It gives great coverage. I tried others but this beat them all. I bought 2 so I wouldn't run out.
3,A few good ideas,"There are a few good ideas in this book, but overall, I found the author's suggestions a bit too structured for my use. I teach pregnant and parenting teen girls, and my students would not respond well to many of the suggested strategies. While discipline can be a problem, I think it stems from different causes than most of the ones the author has encountered. With girls cycling in and out due to unstable home situations and poor attendance due to pregnancy or baby-related illnesses, flexibility is the key to teaching success at our school. Some of the advice can be modified to work in my setting, I think, however. The book will probably be more helpful to teachers in traditional classrooms."
3,Had great expectations - ended up with less balls.,"Not worth the money. Less expensive balls work just as well. Quantity advertised as a ""gross"" but only received six."
1,Silly,"I kept waiting for it to become interesting - I'm not a fan of slapstick - Natalie Wood wore beautiful outfits - no matter what else was going on, and was beautiful throughout - Sorry, I truly hated it."
3,"Oh well,","it could have been worse. The acting was great, the story was a bit too fictional but fun to watch. One man's dream of orbiting space. His family if fully behind him on this dream even though they may lose their home. I suppose this could be called a family movie. There is some language with and some inappropriate comments from the adults in the film."
2,BIG Disappointment,"Slow, tired, predictable. I would expect that the screenplay could have been written by a 14 year old (if I had done it, I wouldn't admit it!) Worst movie I've seen Mr. Thornton in."
2,A Shame,"It's a shame to find talents like Thornton's & Madsen's, as well as that of two fine child actresses, wasted on a mess like this. In every scene one feels the screen writers struggling mightily to create something charming, inspirational, and heartwarming, but what they've produced instead is a story that is predictable at every turn, transparently manipulative, and illogical to the point of being insulting. Little feels real or honest. Watch `Fly Away Home' again instead."
2,"Watchable, but nothing special","Disney (or Disney-esque, I'm not sure of the studio) movie with Billy Bob Thornton as a failed astronaut who is building his own rocket on a farm in the Midwest, with the intention of launching it. Wouldn't normally watch this one, but I was stuck on a plane on the tarmac with a weather delay for a couple hours and wasn't allowed to turn on my own computer. Entertaining enough as long as you don't think about how unlikely it all is. Normally would be 1-star, but decent acting from BBT and Virginia Madsen help elevate it to maybe even a 2-star movie."
5,Great FICTIONAL movie!,"This movie was fantastic. I think what a lot of people are missing is that some movies, while not actually plausible, are meant to entertain. This is a work of fiction; it should be taken as such. As a result, it's a feel good movie with fantastic imagery that you can't help but love, so long as you take your ""impossible"" disposition out of the equation."
2,Bought this for a college course,I bought this book because it was required for a college course I was taking. I found the book pretty boring.
1,This book is terrible,"This book was required reading for my law school. It is terrible. If you are shopping for pleasure reading, look elsewhere. If you are buying this because it is required, I'm sorry."
2,Bad taste in water,My water has a dirty taste after putting this in the refrigerator. Never had that before with store bought filters.
1,Not brand new,This appeared to have been a returned item. Foil covering was off filter end and the standard instruction leaflet was missing from the box. Not very sanitary to install a water filter that apparently was handled by a stranger.
2,does not filter much,"My water tester shows the total dissolved solids amount in the water.Comparison: tap water - 110, after my reverse osmosis/carbon filter - 7. After this fridge filter - 97. Almost the same as tap water."
1,Used filter,"Thanks Amazon for sending me a used filter. The seal was not attached and the packaging was extremely worn. Sorry, I'm not drinking water from a used filter for the next 6 months. Terrible customer service."
1,Disgusting!,"An entire case of snacks that will be discarded. Inedible. Dry, horrible tasting. I wish I had seen this other review before purchasing."
5,Wall clock,My old clock was no longer working and I found this clock that is beautiful and within my budget. Thanks
1,ticking way to loud.,the description should let you know that this clock tick very loud. it is a beautiful clock but the sound was diving me nuts after an hour. I did return it
3,Crunchy hair,"This product does help define curls and fight frizz, however when it dries it leaves the hair crunchy and hard. I don't know if it's only this way on african american hair, but I used it the way my hairdresser instructed which is the same as the directions and you do need to use alot of product if you have really thick hair which can be expensive since I need something I can use daily."
1,"This product is truly for ""mixed chicks""","DO NOT purchase this product if you have 4-anything hair! It will not work! I purchased the shampoo, conditioner, deep conditioner, and leave-in products thinking that if I used them all together, they would work. Boy, was I sorely mistaken! This stuff made my hair hard and dry and left flakes. Furthermore, the shampoo has sodium-lauryl sulfate in it ( unless they have changed the formula since I bought it) which is HORRIBLE for tightly-curled hair. I gave the products to a co-worker who has a daughter with type 3 hair."
4,wonderful product for curly hair,"after trying a few different products, i really wanted a creamy conditioner that was light enough for my hair, but still acted as a powerful moisturizer. I wanted it to boost my curls, without making them crunchy. So far, mixed chicks has been the closest thing to fulfilling all my haircare needs. It is the only product i use besides shampoo and conditioner, and I've gotten compliments from other women who wear their hair natural."
3,Smooths hair... doesn't define your curls,"I do feel it penetrated my hair strands, but it doesn't define your curl. You probably need to put something else to define it and hold it in place 100%. IT IS DEFINATELY NOT THE MIRACLE YOU EXPECTED."
2,Leave it where it is,I was not impressed with this conditioner especially for the price. My hair was very hard when it dried and I could not comb it out. I had to wash my hair again.
1,crunchy curls!,"This product was not for me....it left my hair sticky and crunchy. When I use products, I like my curls to stay soft and it didn't do that for me. Plus it weighed my hair down.I ended up buying a cheaper brand (garnier leave in conditioner) for 4 dollars and it worked much better. Also if you want to spend a little more money, I would buy Ojon."
2,More Hype Than Hope,"Didn't work for me. Softness OK, but frizz really still there. For me, Ouidad works much better and even some cheaper products. Won't buy again."
3,The good and the bad,"Mixed chicks worked great on my hair for the first few months I tried it. It was one of the few products that could tamed my frizzy hair during the summer time. However,this product leaves a lot of residue on your scalp. I also didn't like how the silicons in this product left my hair looking like a Jerry curl. I eventually stopped using this product because of the quick build up. I had to wash my hair more than usual which left my hair drier than ever."
1,can't register; says invalid serial number (bought at Target!),"Should have 0 stars. I just bought Anime Studio 5 at Target yesterday. I wanted to use it to make animations for use in my classroom. Unfortunately, when I entered the serial number on the sleeve, the program said, ""invalid serial number."" I tried many more times to enter the serial number, in case I'd made a mistake. I got the same error message. So there's 50 bucks down the drain. Can't return opened software to Target, of course. What a rip off! Ironically, I was able to register it via their website, with the given serial number. Still, it only wants to run the trial or I have to ""buy"" it again."
4,More bouncy pop is not a bad thing?,"Although everyone is sick of the same old bouncy pop that is spewing out of the radios these days, this CD puts a new spin on it. Somehow this song manages to get you up and moving. Upside down is a great song. I encourage you to buy it if you like pop. It is good to see the A*Teens not singing an old song but an original for once. Good job!"
5,UPSIDE DOWN,WHAT A NICE AND UP BEAT SONG!!!!! YOU HAVE TO BUY IT IF YOU LOVE POP MUSIC...THEY ARE THE NEW GROUP OF POP!!!
2,defective from the start,This flashlight came with one led blown. The packaging states that the lifetime warranty does not include leds or batteries.There is no information on where to purchase replacement leds.
4,crank lite,this flashlight works very well and is a very good light source. It is easy to use. And anyone can use it
5,Garrity Power Lite,Works as advertised and at a resonable price. Item shipped quickly. Like the idea of not needing batteries.
3,amazon bungled here,"The samples and some of the reviews are not from the CD that is supposedly the subject of this page. The three-star rating and this review should be removed (along with the others) when the amazon employee who goofed here is fired and this page is consequently able to be updated with the correct information and links, so that reviewers can review this CD."
4,great for easy carry,"great stand when you have to carry lots of equipment. the only issue, would not use this stand outside in windy conditions, it could blow over. wide enough to manage a large binder and stable enough to hold my ipad. tray in the stand is a nice place to hold extra guitar stuff. it's expensive for a music stand but the convience of a folding stand that can actually hold heavy binders makes it worth it."
4,"Not crowning anyone who would be king (or queen), but entertaining rememberance for the early 70's","Sean was still making his bones as Bond, and finding out if he could work with the hot Ms.Canon (Cannon?...Grant?), Anyway, Chris Walken was already heading up the ladder and the plot is nicely strolling along as we (the audience) take a kind of ""Dog Day Afternoon/Inside Man director's flashback flashforward Gangnam shuffle."
3,Has its strengths but overall disappointing,"This film should have been a lot better than it is, considering the quality of the cast and the reputation of the director. The problems are a good idea marred by a poor screenplay with generally lackluster dialog, unaccountably pedestrian direction, and a confusing mishandling of the surveillance motif which makes it hard for the viewer to understand properly how it fits into the rest of the film. Probably only two stars, but give it an extra star for the strong supporting performances, especially by Ralph Meeker and Alan King, and the excellent jazz soundtrack by Quincy Jones. Worth watching for those strengths. Good DVD transfer."
3,tropical slow mover,"This book was easy to relate to being older but was slow moving at times.An easy and fairly quick read. It isn't one of those ""I couldn't put itdown"", type of books but was fairly enjoyable."
5,Excellent and fun,"This is a very enjoyable set of swinging, accessible pieces. The best, including the first two songs, are tremendous. The first song is a swinging piece with blazing saxophone solos which is suddenly dominated by a bluesy slide guitar. It is a great moment, and makes one think about how conformist jazz is today--anything even slightly different than Wynton's approved set of sounds is startling now. When this CD is not at a tremendous peak, it is still very good and a lot of fun. The liner notes must be among the most humorous and thoughtful in the history of recordings. Phillip Johnston is a gifted composer, arranger and saxophonist and achieves a real career peak with this album."
5,We love Shaun!,My 4 yr old grandson and I are huge Shaun the Sheep fans. He's been into Shaun since he saw Wallace & Gromit's Aclose Shave.
2,good price but weak clip,liked everything about this case except belt clip system. It has very thin plastic. Mine broke after a few days normal use. Very happy with customer service. Refunded purchase price with no problem.
3,"Decent instruction, a little too broad for my purposes","I was looking for basic instruction in using punch mitts with a striker, but with a focus on boxing. This DVD incorporates more MMA-style moves (grapples, kicks, elbows) than simple punches. The instruction is good, but for the price, it's too much if you are only looking for basic boxing instruction. There are some pretty good videos on Youtube that fit the bill."
5,magnificent and wildly inventive,"A well-made, well-envisioned (it's based on a book) adventure family film about growing up and being a kid at the same time."
5,Excelent,"This movie is excelent, refreshing and its a lesson of friendship and imagination. I Loved it"
5,The movie was great but the quality was ok!,I rated this high because the movie is great but the quality was not that great over the computer:0( My students still enjoyed it!
4,Good movie,My kids love this movie and it helps them see how people deal with death. Good movie for the kid in every adult too.
4,Review,"Bridge to Terabithia is a lot about using your imagination to escape everyday stresses. It's a realisticly sad story because of that, but also a story about keeping an open mind and an open heart."
5,Bridge to Terabithia,This is a thoughtful movie that will appeal to all ages. It is great to watch with the entire family.
1,Depressing & Mediocre,"Here are the problems I had with this movie:1. The whole Terabithia thing was just like an episode of Barney- they were just using their Imaginations. If they were imagining all this, then they could have come up with more. They had limited imaginations.2. The cute little girl DIES. Was that really necessary??? Why not let her dog die or something? Is this a kids' movie? Kids don't want to see little girls die.3. Why in the heck couldn't the little boy at least Imagine that the girl was still alive in Terabithia??? He could have imagined her as a princess, queen, etc. He just lets her die though!When this movie ended I looked at my wife and we both commented on how we felt violated to have wasted 2 hours of our lives watching this mess.Avoid this like the plague."
4,Good Family Film but....,"have the Kleenex ready! My mom, 10-year-old son, 6-year-old daughter, and myself just finished watching BRIDGE TO TERABITHIA. This is definitely a family film that everyone will find enjoyable. However, since it does (at least most of the time) closely follow the book of the same name by Katherine Paterson (Bridge to Terabithia), if you've read it you'll know that the tears will come.As a fantasy film, it's on the light side. This isn't the kids' version of a huge fantasy epic such asThe Lord of the Rings - The Motion Picture Trilogy (Platinum Series Special Extended Edition), so don't go into it expecting to see tons of special effects.However, as a ""struggling to fit in"" story that features two middle-grade students, this movie scores high. This is the type of ""bullies-crush on the teacher-surviving middle school"" story that will never be out of fashion.Overall, an entertaining yet sad family film I would recommend to others."
3,senoir reader,i bought this unknowing the real story. i tossed it into the trash. little fantacy and lousy story. death of a real child should not be in a fantacy movie. it's bad enough to happen in real life.
1,Wow...Hear that Sound?,"If you listen very carefully throughout the movie, you will hear a very high-pitched spinning sound throughout the soundtrack. Unfortunately, by the end of the movie you will come to understand that the source of the disturbing audio is Walt Disney spinning with disgust in his grave. Shame on you Walt Disney Company!"
3,Just OK,So I see where they were trying to go with this movie and thats cool. I just wish they would have let us in on the type of movie it was before we bought it. No im not upset the girl dies. Im upset that this movie was about reality and not fantasy! lol. I thought I was buying a fun fantasy movie where I can just forget real life for a couple of hours and have some good ol fantasy fun...but no I get a real downer. I was looking for Harry Potter and got Steel Magnolias. So if youre looking for a light hearted fanstasy fun film than this IS NOT the film for you.
2,This Movie is not what was expected and not for kids,"I have grandchildren ranging from newborn to 12 and although the newborn didn't comment on this film, the others had plenty to say. They hated it, everyone of them. It was sad and left them all feeling really depressed. I can understand, it did the same thing to me. We all assumed this was a movie about cool fantasy creatures, but it wasn't, it was so filled with sorrow.Maybe this would be a good film for fathers to watch who neglect their sons in favor of little daughters, because sons have hearts and need love too. Maybe it's a good movie to help parents see how cruel children can be, and maybe by that they can teach their children to be kind human beings and not bullys. But I wouldn't recommend this for anyone but adults, and only those who want to feel totally at a loss, and have a ten ton weight sit on their hearts. This is a sad, sad film."
3,I like the PBS version better,"For those sick and tired of nowadays special effects movies, who believe a film for the heart is more valueble I recommand the PBS version under the same title."
1,this movie stinks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"my friend and and I were watching it,and at end the main character dies.this is not a family movie"
1,Anti-Christian spin,"Katherine Paterson was the daughter of Christian missionaries; her children's books evidence her faith and understanding of the human condition - especially as it pertains to the very real world of children. Sadly, this film uses Paterson's story to present Christians as depressed, dark, repulsive people. In the end, Biblical truth is pushed aside rather powerfully by the harsh father of the Christian family at an extremely emotional moment. Instead of celebrating faith, this film seems to deliberately undermine it. I grant it two stars for the creativity of the fantasy land and for the delightful performance of the young female lead - but I would never recommend it to anyone."
5,"Te sorprenderá, si tú quieres!","Llevé a mis hijos con la idea que muchos han tenido en revisiones previas, de ver una película de fantasía. Aquí en México, aparece con el título de ""El mundo mágico de Terabithia"", y me tocó que hasta el que se encontraba en la ventanilla no conocía que estaba en cartelera cuando le pedí los boletos.Empezamos a conocer a los personajes, y a lidiar con la persistencia de una niña que nos intentaba llevar a su mundo mágico. Ojalá encontraramos a muchas personas como esta niña, para sobrellevar mejor nuestra vida diaria. Gente como ella, cambian a las personas, y así contribuyen a cambiar de manera positiva al mundo. Les sugiero que lleven un pañuelo cuando la vean. Es una película muy motivadora, se las recomiendo."
3,I like much more all the other cds than this one,"I like too much the songs, voice and interpretation of Nek, however I like much more the other cds of Nek. This Cd is acceptable but it is not great and it is very expensive for the content. Because I am a fan of Nek I bought it but it is the Cd which have liked me less among all.I hope he records more cds as good as the others."
1,A Rip-Off,"The book of the same title is relatively good, but the companion workbook is a waste of money! It requires you to have the original book to work along with it.Get the REAL book which also includes the exact SAME exercises that are featured in the companion, with the exception being the companion includes loads of empty space for you to be write in.So, get the REAL book and get a cheap journal to write in those exercises (instead of this costly, redundant workbook), and leave this companion on the shelf."
3,Functional,"Seems like every time that I get caught in therain, I've forgotten it. My stuff has still nevergotten wet. I don't think it's a necessity. Probablywould help if you were riding in a storm, though."
2,Worked great for 12 hours.,"I gave this 2 stars because it did work when I got it, and if it had continued to work, it might have been a good product.I followed instructions, and hung it under my stairs, where it is very dark usually. I set the timer so it would go off after a couple minutes and left it alone. Light went off, I'm assuming the timer worked.Next day I went to look under my stairs and I tapped it - it flickered but didn't come on. I repeatedly tapped it and it sometimes would flicker on/off but would never come on and stay on. I'm not going to bother to send it back because of postage. I instead picked up a $15 floor lamp at IKEA and it's doing the job just fine.When it worked, it was bright enough to see by, though I wouldn't recommend it for a closet or other area where you need to be able to discern differences in details like colors."
2,"Not much light, need to have specific use",This light is not good for general lighting ... it may work for a very specific lighting need but doesn't even do much good for even relatively small spaces.
2,Cheap Lights,"I knew these were cheap based on the price. I was looking for a light for my closet. These lights dont stay on, you have to tap them several times, dont bother buying."
3,Very nice,"I bought this item for a very dear friend of mine because she wanted one for quite some time. There is nothing extravagent about it, but it does work well for the purpose it serves."
5,A pretty cool book for mixology fanciers,"If you're the type of person who orders something different every time you go out, you'll like this. In fact, you'll probably like it even if you tend more towards simply getting a beer every time (like me).There's some unusual drinks in here, along with some interesting combinations of occasion and beverage. Recommended choices range from the mundane (a dollar draft when you've got a buck and change in your pocket) to the historical (a rum flip during the Revolutionary War) to the utterly odd (the Bullshooter, a hangover remedy involving vodka and beef broth). Situations listed include holidays, life events, people you want to impress, and massive hangovers. The writing is quite amusing and even includes information on what not to drink in a specific situation."
4,Go Video Dual Deck VCR,"Received on time although shipped much later than the estimated ship date. There are a few issues, but the seller has been contacted to resolve.EHawkins"
3,"If There's No News, Make It Up","Clark Gable and Walter Pidgeon are newsreel photographers working for different companies on the search for the same stories. There isn't much they won't do for a story, especially Gable, and one of the film's highlights comes at the beginning of the story as Gable creates a battle scene in China just to satisfier his boss' demands. When famous aviatrix Myrna Loy enters the scene, the boys' competition only intensifies. The story is entertaining, although the scenes in the Amazon were hard to believe. Gable carries the film, with his charm and energy, while a number of supporting actors really add to the fun as well. It's a timely film to watch these days, as people are questioning how much of the news is made more newsworthy by tabloids and over-zealous reporters looking for a good story. This film takes a comic slant to that question, but makes its point nonetheless."
5,better than the 1st 2,"real quickly, i shall say that this is yet another fantastic product of flinner, grier, and phillips. in addition the listener is also given a healthy dose of stuart duncan and flux. as usual the tunes are all original. if you like either of the first ones, you have no other choicce than to love this one."
5,Really good!,"I saw Kate Aumonier supporting James Blunt, before he got really famous, and to be honest liked her more than him. On stage she's amazing, and some of the songs just blew me away. Its not an album full of number ones, but ""you with me"", ""much like yesterday"", ""fall from grace"" and ""simple heart"" are well worth a listen. Really moving, and talented writing. Now up there in my all time top 10 songs."
4,We got the feeling now!,"This CD features soul artists performing covers of Beatles songs, with one exception. The exception being ""Anna"" by Arthur Alexander, which is the original version of a song the Beatles covered on their first album. This is a fun CD. All of the songs are at least interesting, and some of them are great. My personal favorites are ""Let It Be"" by Aretha Franklin, ""Day Tripper"" by Otis Redding and ""Hey Jude"" by Wilson Pickett. By the way, ""Day Tripper"" is the live version, which for some reason is not mentioned anywhere on the CD. If you enjoy hearing cover versions of Beatles songs, you will probably enjoy this CD."
5,Worked great.,Received quickly. Worked as described. Purchased a hand held steamer and use it to disinfect chicken coop and fog the birds. Keeping a distance of course.
3,"Eh, It's nothing to write home about.","Purchased one of these for work in a small lab. For what we use it for, it's okay, but it would definitely not be the tool of choice for a serious craftsman. The stock guides are basically just bronze guide blocks, with a bearing at the back edge of the blade, all could stand to be upgraded, which I believe the way it's designed that is possible to do. Out of the box the table was not square to the blade, but wouldn't really expect it to be. Having the light built ito the base is a nice touch, also being able to lock the machine out easily is good if you have kids that might be around. The stock blade is probably a decent general purpose blade for softer materials, luckily it is a standard size so quality replacements are easy enough to find. The belt on the other hand is not so easily found.Short of it is, for a home saw, you can probably get some good work out of it, but you really have to work with the set-up to get it ""tuned"" in."
5,Very Good Saw for the bucks!,"This saw is VERY accurate, quiet running. It did not need much adjustment, except to tighten the blade a little. These blades always stretch at first use. The saw is also very light, easy to move. Cuts through walnut easily, as long as you don't push hard to get the cut done really fast. I doubt you could re-saw 4X4's with it."
5,Spiritually Up Lifting,"God has truely anointed you and with this gift God will continue to bless you and myself along with everyone who not only purchased this CD, but has listen too it. One Luv and remember to always "" KEEP IT REAL""MUSICALLY YOURSKjrisma"
2,Disappoiting,The book is too theory-oriented; not suitable for engineers. I felt disappointed.And the chapters on PLL and switched-cap. are too common-sense! No use at all for practising engineers...I don't want to recommend this book -
1,"It's international edition, cheaper, poor printed and not allowed to be sold in US.","This is an international edition of Razavi's book!The book is much more poor printed compared with US edition.The international editions of a textbook are often much cheaper, poor printed and most important, THEY ARE NOT ALLOWED TO BE SOLD IN THE US.This book was sold directly by Amazon.Amazon is cheating when selling this book. There is no place saying it is an international edition. I also cannot understand why amazon can sell the international edition in US. This is not allowed.I wonder, whether this international edition, sold with a much cheaper price outside the States but with much poor print quality, is worth $67.After all, if I want to buy an illegal, cheap international edition, I do not need to buy this one sold by Amazon. There are a lot of cheaper international editions in ebay. They will at least tell you what they sell is international edition, not like Amazon, who says nothing."
3,An interesting and nice rendition of the originals,"There is something for everyone on this CD. Vocals, non-vocals, blusey, non-blusey, pop, non-pop . . . . you get the idea. I enjoy this CD. I sing karaoke a lot and I found that the version of ""Your Smiling Face"" is a refreshing change from the studio version, using a lot of sax. Gets a great response from the crowd.One side note though: The CD jacket lists the titles on the back, but they aren't in the order that they play on the CD. Spooky isn't it!?Buy it used if you can. It might not be worth full-price. But if that's all you can find, you likely won't be disappointed.Cheers,Spencer!"
3,alright,considering this is adidas..i wud think it shud be good quality...its not..i havent washed it yet and i already see boblings in it...i have just worn it twice...waste of my $12..totally
2,It's BIG,"I'm sure it's a good watch, and I really liked the idea of all the features, but it's really, really, big. I was used to wearing a small Seiko quartz, and this watch was just too much for me. I sent it back, with a heavy heart."
2,good for a first attempt,"the opera trance was a nice piece of music, but i do not think it qualifies as a great piece. suffice to say, i write this review with a heavy heart. mrs. trance bears her soul, and i appreciate that. the listener must ask 'is this all'? is there not more we can expect from a major recording artist? is there not more i deserve for a $2.95 used recording? i'm sorry mrs. trance but this disappoints, i'm very sorry to admit that your expectations and mine have been tremendously compromised. i do not advice buying this record. best of luck next time. i hope your future is more promising than history suggests."
3,Exactly what I ordered,"Order was not processed very quickly. Arrived OK, once shipped, and I am pleased with product; at lease the parakeet is."
4,Very helpful,"I had a hard time studying for the Psych GRE because I found that the Kaplan and Princeton Review books contained entirely different information. After taking the test yesterday, I would definitely recommend using this book. It explains concepts rather than giving random facts, as the Princeton Review book does. In addition, I picked up a copy of the Barron's AP Psychology review book. It provides a really good overview of the topics and fills in some missing gaps."
1,Not worth the paper it's printed on,"I have had very little luck with Kaplan products in the past, and this was no different. I tried the Barron version also, it didn't find it to be any more comprehensive. I understand that this test requires a widespread mastery of concepts, but the holes in this book were ridiculous. I guess I should've listened to my profs when they told me just to read an Intro Psych textbook from cover to cover a couple times. Alternatively, the Princeton Review version of this book is at least somewhat better than Kaplan's copy. If you want good GRE General test stuff, definitely check out Princeton Review instead. I have both sets of books (Kaplan and PR) and have found the latter to be way better. Good luck."
2,Trouble focusing,"This book had promise. The author did a fine job of presenting this wonderful family of plants, but the photography was the worst I have ever seen in a published work. I quit counting the out-of-focus pictures just a short way into the book, and they already numbered 20. I skimmed ahead, and sure enough, there were more. Many more.Truly incredible...I very rarely return a book, but this one is going back."
2,If you know nothing...,"This book only covers very basic information. If you know anything about multi carrier shipping solutions, find another source for information"
5,Extremely Helpful,"While shipping of packages is important to so many businesses, it's getting more complicated every day. The author has done his homework and explains the many advantages of a computerized shipping system in clear terms. This is also a consumer-oriented book: you learn what NOT to do. I like the honesty and passion of the author. He's packed a lot into a concise book; share it with staff at all levels of your business. At 25 bucks, what a bargain."
5,One of the most influencial books I've read this year.,"Having been born in 1981 I was educated as a teen about the importance of safe sex and the realities of HIV and AIDS. But, this book brought home the true horrors of the history of the pandemic. While lengthy, it is extremely informative and, if read with an open mind, refreashingly unbiased. I found myself taking extra time and care in reading ""And The Band Played On"" just to let the information sink in."
3,"Great book, mediocre editing.","""Home"" is ""hor_ne"" throughout, and ""die"" is ""the."" One often reads about people who ""go hor_ne to the."" The dramatic running tally that in the original book played counterpoint to the negligence, self-interest, politics and complacency of certain groups and communities is missing. The narrative itself seems to be the same sad, frightening and dramatic tale of scientific epidemiology and human tragedy, but search-and-replace errors plus other typesetting goofs make this a tough read."
5,Me and My Woman,"Some of the most amazing live solo acoustic music I've ever heard. The live versions of ""Me and My Woman"" burns with a fire that could only have been captured live. I love his use of delay and reverb to fill in the blanks where the Orchestration of the original Stormcock version is absent. This album re-opened my eyes to how much one person can put into a performance.A sound investment for sure."
5,A smart thriller that is one of the best ever made,"One of my favorite movies of all time, this film teaches a number of moral lessons as it takes the audience on a bungee ride of suspense and murder. In the classic Shakespeare tradition (King Lear; Hamlet), the protoganist Cuba Gooding, takes a tremendous fall from power, wealth, and acclaim to find himself a fugitive thanks to his plagirized book in which he accurately tells of a number of gruesome murders, including details that only the killer could know. The ensuing manhant and redemption rank up there with the best potboilers of their kind (Fugitive), and the smart intelligent script weaves a number of literary allegories into the plot that left an impact on me long after I finished viewing it."
3,"DECENT RENTAL, COULD AND SHOULD HAVE BEEN A THRILLER","What a brilliant premise: dying man gifts last manuscript to a hotshot lawyer, lawyer turns it in as his own, only to discover that its murder mysteries were in fact accounts of actual crimes. Unwittingly ensnared thus and on the run from the law, he must with great speed and secrecy solve the mystery himself before cops get to his scruff.Decent enough. It's even well made by and large. Cuba Gooding out-does himself in the lead. But just when you curl up all poised for a remote-chewing legal thriller, hole after hole comes a-punched in the script. About twenty convenient twists later it's time to switch off mentally and settle for the reality that it was an endurable rental for the price.Female audiences may have compromising glimpses of Gooding to look forward to, but the daffy conclusion is a comprehensive unisex disappointment."
2,Same old stuff,"Sorry to say it but this video does a huge disservice to the great sport of MotoGP. Dorna (MotoGP right holder)as a generally savvy media company should take the production from SRO and take it inhouse. The DVD is 180 minutes long but the pre-race and race reports account for only about 120 minutes. While the picture quality is excellent, the coverage of each race is maddeningly inconsistent with in several cases the pivotal action being left out. The other 60 minutes is taken up by video tours of the participating countries (in most cases they used the exact same footage from previous year's DVDs) and the obligatory camera onboard lap which again differs little from previous years. Overall very disappointing, if I wasn't such a big bike fan I wouldn't buy it. If you want to see a really good racing bike DVD check out the World Superbike year review, its a far superior product (the DVD, not the actual racing)."
4,love the way this band never stands still...,"there's very few bands that can shift gears quite like Primal Scream. from Screamadelica to Give Out... to XTRMNTR, these guys are always changing their spots. Riot City Blues leans mostly towards Give Out...(minus the P-Funk influence) with its ""Rocks Off"" attitude, yet still has a sound all its own. Standout tracks: Suicide Sally, Little Death, 99th Floor andthe New York Dolls nod Sweet Rock n'Roll..."
2,"Whoa! Reality check here, boys, this is a really poor effort.","Have you ever had a friend, acquaintance or colleague confess to you that he used to play in a professional band and then hand you a copy of the album, so that when you play it you understand why a music career was not pursued? Well, this is one of those albums. I'm not sure what it is about Primal Scream that every other album strikes me as a stinker but they do have a propensity for erratic work product. While this effort is at least inoffensive, it is also uninspiring and ho hum. It's a great party tape so long as you are at the party with the artists, if you knows what I means. Listen to the sound samples thoughtfully provided by amazon, the whole album is no better or worse, just longer. I'd rate this one star but I like Primal Scream thus a pity star to go with their deserved ranking."
2,Interesting but not well done,"Unfortunately the quality of the physical media is poor, and copies with one side of one DVD blank are found, gaps where the recording were not well recorded show up, and since the company that made the product sold that line to another company that does not support it, you may get a good set of not too great movies, or you might get a not so good set of not too great movies. Even missing part of the material the set is worth more than most of the used copies sell for, and it is NOT the seller's fault that there are issues with the original manufacture."
1,Cheap junk -- beware!,"I bought this to secure my commuter bike to the rack in the storage room of my apartment building as a casual theft deterrent. It was never banged up, exposed to elements, or even taken outdoors. After roughly 60 or 70 unlockings the key became difficult to turn. A few days later when I inserted the key and turned it with normal pressure, the key broke off in the lock (just completely shattered -- little shards of metal everywhere).This lock is junk and does not stand up to the lightest possible use. Save your money."
5,You will LOVE this cd!!!,"My kids and I love this cd. We bought it at Bronner's Christmas Wonderland and had a wonderful time the whole way home listening to it. This cd gives me great joy. My kids love singing along to ""I saw 3 ships"" and ""The Little Drummer Boy""(which is a beautiful rendition of an old favorite).I cant wait until christmas time to listen to it again. Is it almost time yet?!!!"
1,"Pretty pictures, no details -- maybe good for riding a tour bus.","This book looks impressive, but when I tried to get down to details of actually traveling in Portugal, they just weren't there.The maps are such high level they are worthless for actual navigation. There is no information on where to find the train stations, bus stations. The information about hotels and restaurants are laughable. In Oporto, the book says you can take river trips upstream, but gives no information about where they originate or where to find the boats.I suppose this book might be useful if you just like to look at pictures, and your travels are all organized by a tour bus operator.The old standby, Lonely Planet, is a much better choice."
4,Works well to manage kids at home,"I know this is targeted more for small business, but I am a high end home user (gigabit network, 2 WAP's and lots of devices). I most enjoy the fact that I can effectively do things like block my teenager's laptop (iPad, etc) from getting to Facebook with not a ton of work. It helps get homework done and keep harmony in the house."
2,Switching from bad to good WAN is not smooth,"Used on 20 Mbit/sec cable as primary and 1-2 Mbit/sec 4G connection as secondary. With auto-fail-over it does switch from cable to 4G when cable stops working, but transition is not smooth - few seconds when connection to the world is not available. When both connections up - network tests show much lower speed than cable could do alone. Doing Skype is not smooth on this device."
4,So far so good,"I purchased the RV042 specifically for failover between my cable modem and adsl line. Up until this point I'd been doing a manual failover. Also, I'd been hesitant to run a consumer router, instead always running a linux box for home routing/firewall needs.Out of the box it was very easy to setup the basics, emulate everything my linux box was doing at the time (incoming forwards, etc.), and within 1/2 hour was up-and-running. No complaints except I was unable to perform a firmware upgrade via a browser unless I fired up a VM and did it with Internet Explorer. Similar to my complaint with all Linksys products, they really need to stop developing for IE/Active crap and focus on actual web-standards - especially now with folks moving away entirely from Windows overall.Performance hasn't seemed to take a hit, and soon I'll setup the VPN and SNMP features so I can get some logging going. That's another complaint, no easy way to log or setup via a CLI - unless I missed something."
3,Okay,"I've really enjoyed Ms Lowell's writing, but this book, although it had some very romantic scenes in it, left me wanting more. More plot, more mystery, anything really other than the romance. I don't regret buying it and I'll probably keep it in my library or give away, but I probably won't find myself rereading it because it was a little too plain for me. Quick and easy read, but a little disappointing in regards to Ms Lowell's capability. On to the next one!"
2,not big enough,i thought it was bigger but the kids enjoyed it. next time i want to have enough description about the product.
1,I could not agree more.,"I could not agree more. This must be the most colossal waste of time and money I have ever witnessed. I really enjoy Isla Fisher as an actress. So, I decided I would rent this movie, and give it a go. I can NOT continue to watch this, as I fear my IQ will drop to about 03. There really are not any words sufficient to convey just how much a waste of time this movie is;so I am going to stop right here, and say so long and good riddance."
4,"Wow, hilarious stuff!!!!","This is just one of those ""I never knew this existed"" things. I was viewing YouTube one day to see photos of the Kirkeby Mansion and the background music was the 2nd song on this album, ""Beverly Hills."" I knew I had to find this!!!Remarkably this works out better than what one would expect. Of course, Buddy Ebsen was fairly talented as a singer anyway but the whole thing works out except for the Miss Jane/Mr. Drysdale collaboration on ""Love of Money.""In essence it is the show set to music and recorded in stereo sound. No one leaves character right down to Jethro being a dummy who is girl crazy.Is this going to be for the serious music fan? Nope. If you are a huge fan of the show like me this is a must have. Now if we can only get CBS Home Entertainment to release seasons 4-9 of the series unedited on DVD we'll be doing good!!!! Well doggies!"
2,good selection of tunes,I realize this is not stereo but the transfer sounds tinny and not up to par with other mono cd's I've aquired.
1,broken as delivered,"Received the product broken. Vendor said they are not allowed to resend replacement product for products ordered through Amazon. So I get my purchase price back BUT I HAD TO PAY THE POSTAGE... So for cheap products, it is not worth going through Amazon."
2,Full of cliches,"We love the Red Sox in this house, so I thought I'd love this book. WRONG!! It tries to cover everything Boston in the first five minutes and it is so full of cliches! It is just poorly written. The plot isn't bad, but the writing is. Go to Boston, read something, ANYTHING else about Boston...but don't bother with this."
2,a strike-out.,"I spotted this book and had to read it! I'm a Red Sox fan, so I assumed I would like it. I was wrong. The book is immediatly confusing, and for someone just reading for Red Sox reasons, it was very boring. I also noticed that for someone not in New England, the chowder and ""curse of the bambino"" refrences might not make sense. 2 stars for a good try by the author."
2,DVD,Will not play in my DVD player but will play on my computer. It says DVD on the box. This is the second one I have tried.
5,Like Father Like Son,"Natasha Anastasia Tarpley introduces us to Miles as he gets ready for his first hair-cut. As most small children are, he's a bit nervous while at the same time excited as he takes this journey into the world of the ""Big Boys."" The scene of the barbershop shows that of encouragement and support for little Miles and depicts the relationship between father and son and the way men interact with one another.With the use of watercolors, E. B. Lewis illustrates the characters in a way that brings them to life and complements the story perfectly. They are warm, colorful, and do an excellent job of conveying Tarpley's characters along with the different scenes portrayed in barbershops in the African American community. This story speaks volumes and I highly recommend it.Reviewed by Tee C. RoyalThe RAWSISTAZ Reviewers"
5,A surf masterwork,"What a fantastic book! I don't want to give away the surprises of the novel, so I'll keep my comments brief, but I loved every page. Fahey and Magdalena make an inspiring couple at the heart of the book. Kem Nunn is a master of mystery, violence, cultural confusion, ecology, and everything else he touches. The physical and cultural landscape is rendered so vividly that I drove to the straits myself just to verify what I knew must be true. (The photos at the beginning of this page are worth perusing.) Over and above the many delights of plot, culture, politics, and literature, though, is Nunn's enduring love of surfing. He's a hell of the writer on the ground, but he's unbeatable in the waves. The novel's climax is one of the most eloquent, thrilling rides I've ever taken. Thanks, Kem Nunn, for providing an unforgettable experience for hodads like me."
3,Janelle is the Best of Three,"Hello, I love anthologies because I get to read lots of writers in a short amount of time. I thought Janelle Denison's contribution was the best. Nina Bangs' story added a supernatural element unnecessary to carry the story. I think MaryJanice Davidson's story shied away from love scences. Isn't that how romance writers gain notoriety and fans? It's about 3.5 stars in my book, so read at your own risk.R"
3,Happy so far,I have been using this product now for one week and have noticed a significant improvement in my energy and mood.
2,Way to Violent,"To many songs about shooting, hurting, f*cking you up. The first 4 or 5 songs are great but the rest just get lost in mindless voilence. Someone please tell me how this is humurous."
2,I won't do what ya tell me!,"It's idiotic that they accuse Rage Against the Machine of being hypocrites. How else is Rage going to get their message out there? Just like Morello said they could play to empty squats, but they need to be able to show people whats up. People need to wake up and i guess being endorsed by SONY so that later on, getting your message out could pay off was the idea Rage had. I say Infectious Groves' ideas blow, but the music isn't half bad."
1,not durable,"Like two previous reviews, this coat rack really lasted only a month before it snapped in half at the connection points (coat rack needs to be assembled by screwing the rods together). It is not fixable, unless you have welding equipment. Am now considering another coat rack made of solid wood."
1,Looks nice but not durable,"I received the coat rack in a box that looked like it had been through a war zone - crushed and torn - however there was enough protection inside the packaging that the coat rack was completely undamaged. It was easy to assemble and looked nice, although it didn't stand perfectly straight. But within a month of use it broke. I had a reasonable load of coats - 3-4 heavier winter coats and a few light coats. The bottom segment snapped, and now it only stands straight if I lean it against a wall and balance the coats perfectly.This product may be fine if you only intend to hang a couple of light jackets on it, but it's definitely not sturdy."
5,best band ever?,"as a huge hanoi rocks fan in the early 80's I found this band's album on you and went to their first ever show in the u.s. at the downtown scream club in l.a. what a show, these guys had l.a. in the palm of their hand. with every wanna-be band in attendance. axl & co. these guys blew everyone away, and showed that their album was no fluke. I'm still waiting for a band t00 come along and kick me where it hurts like they did. I saw them many times over the years when they were touring, or living in l.a. please do them a favor and find anything you can from them and buy it. they were without a doubt the best band besides hanoi and the dogs d'amour (EVER)"
2,Can't really recommend this...,"Admittedly, the concept behind this product is excellent. Scrubbing your feet with a handheld brush in the shower can be very hazardous to your health. Unfortunately, this product lacks in one critical area: the stiffness of the bristles and their ability to exfoliate your skin.The bristles on this product are WAY too soft and do a very poor job of actually exfoliating your skin. I would recommend that the makers of this product literally triple the stiffness of the bristles in order to do an adequate job of exfoliating. I'm sure that using this product with soap is better than nothing but it could have been so much more effective.The product does stick to the bath tub making it a stable platform but if you stick on the wall after use, it will fall down when it dries out. If you have slick, non-textured tile, you might have more luck with getting it to stick to the wall."
1,2012: Doomsday - a sign of the death of the film industry,"Without question, the most awful movie ever made. Amazon needs a whole new category for this one! Fundamentalist Christians lie and manipulate history, co-opt the traditions of another culture, and use an obscene measure of melodrama to inflict drivel on the unsuspecting viewer. The most charitable thing that can be said about this film is that it is, at best, insulting and nauseating."
2,Unintentionally funny,"""2012 Doomsday"" is funny for all the wrong reasons. On the surface, it's an apocalyptic horror movie, but it spends a lot of time on religious discussions. It mixes together Mayan and Christian prophecies about the end times and the result is a confusing mess. Add to this bad acting and special effects and you get a movie that is unintentionally funny, sometimes hilarious. Recommended for those who love bad movies."
5,Villeroy cups are classy,"I have several of these cups and they are absolutely classy, paired with the wavy plate as well. I use them to entertain and to just have a cup of hot cocoa. There is a bent spoon I am considering adding to the collection that fits onto the cup. These cups would be perfect for a set in your home."
4,"It works, a little uncomfortable to hold for long period of time","Would be nice to improve ergonomics on this, and reduce noise, it's quite loud. But it works great, comes with alot of attachments for diff sized things, can charge in home or car, so I'm happy!"
3,Inflates almost,"I own an INTEX inflatable boat so wanted to use this pump.Pump can only inflate half way one of the boats' chaimbers (total 3). Then I think pressure in the chaimber is more then the pump can produce so I have finish up the work by hand.Well it saves me some work.Pump is small so that's a plus at least.If I read the manual correct, you can only charge the battery of the pump using AC adapter not using DC adapter."
4,A Great Fantasy Read,"I was little surprised (given the author) that this was such a well-written manga but I was surprised that there was still humor.Some of the action is not as well drawn as the conversation episodes of the work but still very enjoyable.For the parents, there is one brief scene of some topless nudity but nothing overt.I am looking forward to continuing this series."
5,Great product,"I purchased four place settings, sugar bowl and creamer as a gift. It was well received! This is high quality china with a beautiful pattern. I highly recommend this product."
1,cheap!,Such a shame to have such an awesome looking bra so cheaply made. There is NO padding...or support. It's paper thin.
3,Lots of drills... not much variety,"This book, and the other Dutch Soccer Drills book is full of drills, that if you are interested in running them from a coaching perspective, involve a lot of ""pattern"" play and running. As a competitive level youth coach I personally only use only a handful of drills from these books, and mostly the small-sided games, which do not constitute a large part of this book. Drills where players pass from one position to the next, move, then do some function are good conditioning exercises for the beginning of practices, but they are robotic and repetition oriented and really have limited use training players to make good decisions during games. Stick to the Weil Coerver series for skill development and then keep practices to 2 vs 2, 3 v. 3, 3 v 4 small games for the best development of youths."
3,Is Fanatic Islam a Global Threat?,"The purchase was fine; but, I did not like the book. It was not what I thought it would be."
3,I am sure its good but....,"This little thing is pretty small and light! Would fit in my backpack and I would almost forget it was there! But I bought a ""Lamborghini Rapido Road Bike"" the same time I bought this but its too small to fit over my tire tube air intake thing(sorry don't know the name lol)Maybe it isn't for road bikes? not sure.But it is light, small and I know it works when I pump it, but I didn't know those little tube air in take things come in different sizes and t just doesn't fit."
4,Great for melting butter,"I bought this pan and the Farberware and am happier with the Farberware little pan. This one is good, but it really can only handle melting butter or a very small amount of liquid - like 1 cup. It heats up quickly and contents tend to want to burn. Handle gets hot. It is great though for melting butter, which is what I wanted, but if you want to mix up a packet of gravy, you will need the slightly larger Farberware."
5,Great Book,Good book. Explains things well and very helpful in the area of the mind spiritually. I would recommend it to anyone with a difficulty in this area.
5,Awesome,"I love this Cd because it gives you the original Honey song and the remix with P. Diddy on it. So if you love Mariah, get it. I certainly recommend it."
5,Every Fixed Star,Every Fixed Star was the best yet. The way Jane Kirkpatrick weaves fact and fiction into a smooth and entertaining story issheer genius. The reader is captured on the first page and lives through all the ups and downs of Marie's life all the way to the last page. When you finish this book you feel like you've left a good friend and can hardly wait for the next book so you can spend some more time with her. All of Jane's books are excellent and well worth the time spent reading them but this one is by far at the top of the list.
5,"A gifted author, a wonderful series","This second book in a series of three, was such a good read, I wish there were 10 stars to rate these. Very knowlegable about the first settlers to the Northwest, and the insight into the Native American culture, is eye opening and heartwarming."
1,Not very good,"Morricone is brilliant and I love his music, but some of his newer movie music is more or less background filler, as opposed to actual compositions. This is one of those disks."
4,Damn funny!,This is a comedy B horror flick. I'm going to be a little biased here because I know one of the guys that helped make the show. It really is a good B horror. What not spend the $3 and rent it. Plus Ron Jeremy plays Jesus...that alone is worth it.
2,Very disappointing,"From the cover and the write-ups, one would think that this film definitely had promise. I'm not sure what all the people that gave this rave reviews were seeing that I wasn't, but I think I watched this all the way through without once laughing or being frightened. The premise is similar to that of countless slasher films over the years: tragedy happens at remote camp, killer is never apprehended, years later more hapless boobs return to same remote camp, only to be fodder for aforementioned ""never apprehended"" killer. The humor in this really falls flat, and cleverness never enters the picture. Sure, there's some gore, but nothing you've never seen before. I usually enjoy Reggie Bannister (Phantasm, etc.) but he's rather unlikeable in this and hasn't much to offer. I think from now on when I see the words ""Cult Classic"" on a brand new film, I will pass. 2 out of 5."
3,Ramage's Prize,"A little slower than most Dudley Pope's other Lord Ramage Novels, it still is very enjoyable. The at ""sea action"" is limited...but there is still plenty of good reading."
5,"Pahud - franck, widor and strauss album","i was never a fan of flute music until i got to listen to pahud's album entitled paris more than 10 years ago.this particular cd which have put together the works of franck strauss and widor is simply irresistable.the best cd of pahud so far, thanks to muze21 for making this available to me.anne akiko meyers also released a cd with the same repertoire.two thumbs up!"
3,Better than Mystery but still a bore in the end,"What I really liked about this book was the characters. Straub took settings and situations that mostly are reserved for female characters and filled them in with men. The range of emotions displayed by each male in this book was unique and refreshing to see. Now, as for the story, it was okay but again I was let down. this book does connect the other two together but mystry and Throat failed to keep up the suspense that was evident in Koko. I read or in my case listened to all three back to back and each could have stood on its own. Again, if you enjoy mysteries, read this one as well, but not for strict horror fans. Out of all the books I have listened so far by this author, Ghost Story is the best followed by Koko and then Houses without Doors where all this Blue Rose business begins."
4,Good Stuff,"A much more interesting read than other books I've attempted in this genre (and, for that matter, than Straub's Ghost Story). I usually don't like mystery/horror novels, but picked up a copy on a lark, and found it spellbinding. The story was tight, had believable twists throughout, and featured characters that kept you vacillating between loving 'em and hating 'em. Not gory at all, just well-choreographed and clever. If his other books read like The Throat, I plan on picking up more Straub in the future."
2,Blows,This book [stinks]... I think its hilarious that every interview in the whole book is with MBAs from Harvard. Which would only be useful if you planned on learning about what it was like to go to Harvard.
4,Massdam Rope Puller,"I haven't had a chance to try it out myself, but some others have performed very well. It seems very well made and is much nicer to handle than the cable pullers. My only suggestion would be to have a version with a removable handle to make storage handier. That would be a 5 star item for sure."
4,Historical fiction for teens (and grown-ups).,"I've read several of Barbara Willard's books, and the Lark and the Laurel is really the beginning of the Mantlemass Chronicles. While the language may be a bit difficult for teenage (14 and up) readers to plow through, the historical descriptions and politics that play out in it are wonderful. (And accurate from what little I've read of the period!) Social customs, class structures and well-worded descriptions of late medieval to early renaissance England fill her books. If you like this series, I recommend reading the Brother Cadfael series by Ellis Peters, or any of Sally Watson's books."
2,"main character has not moral values, the movie is pornographic","No doubt the main actress Carice is incredible in this film. But I question the accuracy of portraying a Character that has not sexual morals,I found the movie with unnecessary pornographic too graphic scenes. This movie has a good plot and can be very educational, but the movie is ruined by the pornographic scenes, too bad the actors accepts roles like that. If you are christian do not buy this movie unless is reedited for general audiences, we throw away in the trash the movie dvd. After this experience, we are less naive and more cautious about seeing /buying movies dvd."
5,She has cojones...metaphorically.,"The story of an attractive Jewish woman in the 1940s in Holland, who joins a resistance to save the lives of other Jews. Before her introduction to the resistance, she nearly gets murdered along with about 20-30 other Jews on a boat that was supposed to take them away to a safe location; her parents were among the murdered. After that incident she dyes her hair blond and seduces a Nazi officer, a Captain. Before she realizes it she is in deep and the heads of the resistance want her to find out as much as she can, so she spies on the Nazis and what their plans are. Little does she know that some of the main guys in the resistance are working with the Nazis to round up rich Jews, kill them and split the money among themselves. Watch this for a great story and she has great pair too."
5,An outstanding exprience,"Having shared a similar experience during WW2 in Holland,I found this movie really outstandig in every possible aspect!The story (based on true facts)is filmed in a most reallistic manner and the multi language utillization makes it even more so especially for an exDutchman(presenly Israeli)like myself being fluent in all 4 languages used.The acting of all major characters is superb and needless to say that I fully reccomend this film to everyone!"
4,"A dutch movie missing something.....still, it's a pretty good movie","A movie about WWII.The movie is almost very well made.I'm not sure, but it's just a feeling that remains with you after you watched it."
3,graphic torture scenes,"Terrific acting and fast-moving plot: but, unfortunately, the prolonged and violently graphic torture scenes were too much for the average person to watch. Don't recommend this movie for the faint-of-heart."
4,A WWII Thriller,"A fictional war drama based on a true story, this film unfortunately received only limited release in the USA. Full of action and truly entertaining. Carice van Houten plays a beautiful Jewish woman living in German-occupied Holland during late 1944 who enrolls in the Resistance to fight the Nazis who killed her family."
4,Not all that inspiring,"I like the handle to carry this keyboard around, but it is kind of awkward for little ones to use unless it is sitting on a table or other flat object. The characters will set off when they are moved and you get a jumbled mass of sound coming out of it if it is resting against something that causes the characters to be pushed in all at once. I know my 2 year old does not like to be sitting still, so using this on a table is not really an option for her. And because of the height of the characters, it is not a good ""bring along"" toy since it doesn't fit in a bag well.For the same price, go with the Wiggles Guitar. It has many more buttons and songs and they can carry it around and play it at the same time."
5,Desert Island Stuff,"David Bromberg at his best. This is mostly the flat-picking and fiddling Dave and a relatively mellow listen. This is before the big Chicago blues period with the horns and all. Great tunes, including the Grateful Dead favorite Dark Hollow. I'm working on my third copy of this and I still play it frequently after 30 years. On my 10 desert island recordings list."
4,Cord Organizer,"These are about 2 inches diameter and 1/2 inch thick. I got them to spool up the cord on my headphones that I use on my computer. They're made out of soft rubber, so you just turn one or both shells inside out, wind the cord, then flip the shell halves back down. They're a bit big to wind up earbud cords. They seem to be intended for fairly constant use, but I just got them today, so I don't know about the durability yet. If you want a spooler for long term storing of a larger cord, like a power cord or extension cord, go for the ""Cord and Cable Winder and Organizer"" by Amazon. They are bigger, 3"" in diameter and 1 1/2"" thick, and the plastic shell is more rigid."
2,Ireland's internal political turmoil,"It is always exciting to see a new way of describing Ireland's complex relationship with the British government. This film is set in 1920s when local Irish men organize themselves in the fight against the British military forces policing the civilians. The goal of the resistance is to get full independence that would allow Irish nation to have it's own government, economic policies and educational system and courts. Film felt as it was dragging on. Characters were poorly developed and there simply was not as emotional force to it as I have expected. If you really wish to see a movie about the complex political time of that period, mixed with complexities of the relationship between upper and lower classes of the Irish own society, skip this movie and watch ""The Last September""."
4,Powerful and deep,"A powerful film based in the brutal reality of early 20th century Ireland and the struggle for independence. The major problem? Without a good background in the struggle for Irish independence,the major players of the time, and the prevailing attitudes of the period, it may be difficult to grasp the fuill meaning of the film."
1,P U!!!,"I bought this movie because of my Irish heritage. Boy, did it stink!! I love the Irish Brogue but this was sooo thick, it couldn't be understood. The ""acting"" was bad, the plot was very predictable.The movie was s l o w and boring. Save your money. It doesn't even rate a half star but I could not delete the one I accidently covered!Buy ""The Secret of Roan Innish,"" a much better movie for the money."
2,A bit soft for a university press book,I hoped this book would have more insight into the topic than just a collection of overviews of the particular series. That's been done before and better.
5,A warm and wonderful read,"Northern Borders is a trip to another time and another place, where a youngster deals with his eccentric relatives and the consequences of a family who have lived life on that land for generations. Without sentimentality, without hackneyed characterization, Mosher depicts a time and place so vividly you can't bear that the book must end. I read very widely and this is one of the best novels I've encountered in years. A quiet little gem"
5,Janet Parrett in Seattle,This album will make the hair on your arms stand up. It includes some wonderful original songs written by the band members as well as some traditional folk/bluegrass tunes that wil have you singing along in no time. I think this band is going places. Their harmonious voices blend beautifully. I strongly recommend this CD. You won't be sorry. I only wish they would do another CD. I had to see them in concert after listening to the CD and they are fabulous in concert as well.
1,Don't even bother.,"I had read review after review about how great this product was. I'm glad it worked for those people's dogs, but it sure didn't work on mine. I'll definitely be looking for something else. This product was a huge waste of time."
1,Poor Quality.,"Received this item, packages well. However, two problems were evident after opening.1. The gears in the mixer head are not well made and don't mesh well. I could rarely get the handle to turn a complete revolution without the gears jamming up inside.2. When I was able to get the item stirring, the stir stick in the bottle wobbled wildly. This is because the bearing that holds the stir stick in the mixer head is very loose and allows the stick to wobble back and forth.Overall, a poor quality product. I have returned this for a refund."
1,Jonathon Kane - February,What a piece of garbage. Very poor music. Hope to hear his newest effort. Heard a good cut on Electric Blues.
5,Prejudice,One of my all-time favorite Dr. Seuss books. I used it with the head of Proctor and Gamble as she worked with a multicultural staff.
3,Production Bogs Down the Master,"If you're a die-hard SRV fan of course you have to have this and all existing SRV music, because let's face it, the hunger for more SRV recordings never goes away, but personally I don't find this to be one of his best. To me, the production is very bass-bottom-heavy. The guitar has too much whammy in it. And that Hammond organ in the foreground drives me crazy. These elements combine to make the sound of the tracks too much the same, despite his stellar performance. But live performances are like fine wines, each has its own character and some you like more, some less."
5,Stevie as compared to Stevie...,"One of the main errors(pardon me) for reviewing a new release is to compare it to previous releases or to the artist himself. If some of the new releases were listened to in a vacuum, they would be appreciated for what they are. This is a stellar performance on it's own merits. Only Buddy Guy(when he deems it neccessary) can top this guitar legend. Buddy, can you hear me talkin' to ya! Give us some Sweet Tea live!"
1,"GREAT books, terrible purchase...",Can anyone explain to me the reasoning in buying a boxed set that does not leave room for the seventh book??? Why buy this product when there are pre-orders for sets that include ALL seven books?
5,Nice boxed set for the money,A nice set. I would love to have one for all 7 books but not for the hardcover at sky high prices. This is a great alternative.Recommended.
5,Read them again and again!,"I technically bought these for my boyfriend for Christmas, since he'd never read any of them before, but lo and behold, I'm sitting here every night reading them again myself. They are so addicting, and by no means meant only for children! Rowling's writing is smart and not condescending towards her readers, which means these books are perfect for all ages.I chose to buy this set as the paperback version so that when the complete, hardcover 7 book set is released, I hadn't spent TOO much money and can just go out and get the full set again. Amazon had a great price on these books and I'm very pleased with this purchase."
4,Great Book Set,"I purchased this set for my son's 8th birthday. It arrived well packed so as to protect the decorative cardboard box holding the books. My son loved the set. We had recently finished book one that we had gotten from the library and were just a chapter into book two from the library when he opened this gift. He immediately wanted to return the library book to start reading from his ""own"" copy. The paperback covers and the box all have wonderful artwork.We are now into book three and very happy with this purchase that provides a wonderful set of chapter books that are great for me to read to my son and for him to begin to read on his own."
1,Set of 6 Harry Potter Books,"I ordered the paperback set of the first 6 Harry Potter Books. While reading the 3rd book in the series, I discovered there was a misprint. The book was missing pages 117 to 149 and had double of pages 149 to 175. This was a used book said to be in very good condition. Whoever read it before, could not have missed this mistake. Amazon's solution was for me to mail back the ENTIRE set for a refund. What a hassle and inconvience to find a box that all of the books fit in and making a special trip into town to go to the post office. So only one star this time."
4,Great quality as always,"These were purchased for a friend who had never read them. He received them very quickly, and was pleased with the quality of the books. As always, the reading is excellent."
5,Harry Potter 1-6,A great value!! We saw the exact same set at Target and was much more. I have just finished the first book...I could not put it down. As an adult reading the books I can see how children and adults are hooked on them.
4,nice set,This paperbook set will be a great addition to my collection. The only way it could be better is if it also had the final book.
4,Good product...one flaw!,"Great set, nicely boxed. If you like Harry Potter, you'll love these books. The only flaw was that Book 5 was printed upside down from the cover...not enough to really bother me, though I imagine I looked a bit odd reading the book upside down!"
2,At least it looked good...,"Mediocre telling of a popular book that I haven't read. After seeing pretty adaptations of other childrens books like 'Bridge to Terabithia' and 'Chronicles of Narnia', this one was a pretty big letdown. Everyone seemed like a stock character, and I never got involved with the by-the-numbers storylines. Looked good, though."
2,Pretty Cheesy and convoluted,"This move is basically trying to be Harry Potter, but just can't pull it off. The plot is pretty ridiculously convoluted, none of the characters are really developed all that deeply, and its basically just a bunch of cheesy CGI. (Complete with the bear from the Coke Christmas commercials) I didn't like this movie essentially for the same reason people didn't like the new star wars movies, its just all action and cheesy CGI, no real heart to it. Just a mush of wannabe Harry Potter with toned down versions of Lord of the Rings scenary, and maybe a hint or two of Magic the Gathering or World of Warcraft (Hey, the bears armor was soulbound!) I gave it two stars because I found it mildly entertaining, despite the fact I found myself still laughing more at the movie than with it."
1,Couldn't make any sense of it,"I've got a funny feeling that this was made by massive fans of the book. And they thought that every one else in the world, has read it and where also massive fans of the book. I've never read the book, so maybe if I had the movie might have made some sense."
1,Hated it,"I almost turned this movie off. I think they could have made a good movie. You can tell the story was based on a book with an actual plot. This movie had none of the elements of plot normally associated with a story.Unfortunately, this movie didn't even have good special effects."
2,"Sort of pretty, supremely forgettable","Truly not worth the big to-do that went on with people boycotting and denouncing it when it hit theaters. It's pretty, but not pretty enough to watch just for that. The movie suddenly ends, without answering any of the many questions it raised. I'm not sure if there are movies planned of the sequels, but it seems that this would have lent itself better to a mini-series format -- but of course, there's not as much money in mini-series as there are in feature films."
1,Horrible,"This is a boring, hard to follow, knockoff of The Chronicles of Narnia. Wait till it comes on TV and watch it for free."
2,"Mediocre effects, preachy, disconnected plot","First, the visual effects were pretty weak. Think ""Made for TV"" movie and thats about right.Second, the story seems to stop and start. Very disjointed. You'll spend 15 minutes hiding in a cupboard listening to some drawn out monologue and then ""a miracle occurs"" and the heroine is in the next scene. There is little flow to the film, its almost like the scenes were their own episodes with only the thinnest transitions.Third, talk about preachy. Big bad Magisterium controls everyone and everything and is harming children only opposed by the last ""light"" of the world, a college. Yeah, ok. I mean we all know that colleges are beacons of enlightenment, I mean the frat parties are BRILLIANT. Come on, I'd like my indoctrination to have a modicum of sanity.Bottomline. This is one movie the kids will yawn at and parents will roll their eyes through. Skip it."
4,Beautiful looking movie,"Very good looking movie on Blu-Ray and DVD, sound quality and picture quality where top notch. The movie itself was decent but needs to tell the whole story about how things are and how things came to be, if they would have touched on this they would have had a great movie, not just an ok or good movie to some. As far as the Religious overtones to some this is way overblown. Religion has been exploited for years in many different cultures and many say everyone else is wrong, and are not very excepting of other peoples religions or ideas and that what the movie tends to point out, more so in the book. This movie is very watered down compared to the books and still people are complaining about it.... ;)"
1,disappointment,"The movie was a disapointment. Yeah, the graphics were ok but not as good. The story line deviates from the book. If you are a fan of the book I recommend not buying this movie. It's ok to watch but not to own. They could have done much more but they didn't. I watched the movie before deciding wether to buy it or not and trust me, its not worth your money."
4,The Golden Compass,A super film which suffered from attacks from the religious right. It deserves being seen as it is exciting entertainment with a serious side. I hope they produce the sequel.
1,"Bland, dull, boring","I had hopes for this film, but it certainly left me lacking, especially the generally unemotional interactions between characters. Most of the movie seemed dark or washed of color. The concepts had so much unexplored potential or was missing some meaty back-history that would have given the present moments more meaning. Some of the CG was nicely done, but not exceptional. Overall, I was just plain bored while watching this film."
4,Good Fantasy Flick,My husband and I like watching this movie. It has a very interesting fantasy story line and good actors to top it off. The good story line is also supported by action and possibly a second part?
2,Disappointing,I was disappointed in the movie. The ending left the story open and without and ending. The little girl was too bossy and rude.
3,"Much like Narnia, but far from The Lord of the Rings","While I did like the CGI and all the animals, The Golden Compass felt like a mess to me. The lead girl was good, but the other characters weren't fleshed out in the least. The plot was a little on the boring side, so with all these flaws I can see why the critics are more negative than positive. The ice bears were pretty cool, I give it that, but this movie isn't as good as the Harry Potter films, and miles away from The Lord of the Rings."
5,A great fantasy film,"I was truly disappointed that this film did not do so well in theaters. Aside from an abruptly cut sequel-intended ending (my only complaint about this film and the main reason I believe this film suffered), the casting was perfect, the visual effects were stunning and the storyline kept in line with the spirit of the book. I bought the DVD and it is among my favorite fantasy films, much better than anything in the Narnia series."
3,Never got to use it!,This butter bell arrived broken due to poor packaging--it was totally shattered. I had no problem returning it--great service--but decided to choose another style that seemed a little more sturdy.
4,A fan's review,"I am not a renowned reviewer of music or anything, but I have attempted to review some local bands in my school, and I am in a band, so I kinda have an ok musical taste. I must say, this is a great album, one of you reviewers said something about the first track? When I heard it, I clicked the ""back"" button on my CD player, I neded to listen to it again. What you are getting here is some of the maddest distortion I have ever heard. Yes, the singer's voice is insane, I tried to immitate it, but it did not turn out so well. Anyway, I find myself loving King's X from the first three tracks, I have only listened to half the album, yes, very sad, but I am in love with what I heard. Call me naive, not knowing anything about the band and all, but I do know that I am heartily obsessed and that CD is the first one to go into my CD player every morning. Look for more obsessed fan reviews by me."
5,Raunchy and Raw,"Dogman is King's X's most raw album ever. Its my favorite out of their recordings. I love the Hendrix cover Manic Depression they do. Another song I love is Complain, its fast, furious, and rocks hard. This is King's X best album in my opinion..."
5,Lots of great Bloomers,"The early demos are not very indicative of what Bloomers did later but I guess I'm glad its here. The other stuff is great if this is the only Bloomfield album your going to buy. Otherwise I would just buy all the REAL albums and forget the ""greatest hits"" package."
2,review by the movie grinch,"if you like a formulaic plot with a handsome cardboard leading man and a demanding and berating terminally ill little girl in a black dress and purple lipstick then you will like this! pour yourself some boysenberry syrup and kick back for this gooey mess. not even that cute little what's her name could save me from a gag reflex. if you are a movie grinch like me, and expect movies to be intelligent, entertaining, moving, and authentic, then you will NO LIKE. the leaden romance between the leading dude and the girl's mom is a yawn. i gave it two stars instead of just one because at least i didn't have to watch any dull,labored fornication between people i couldn't care less about. hooray!"
5,LIBRARY FIND,"I PICKED THIS DVD UP AT OUR LIBRARY, MY SISTER AND I AND MY HUSBAND ALL ENJOYED THIS MOVIE. IT HAS A GOOD MESSAGE, AND MY SISTER AND I BOTH PLAN TO BUY IT, AND I WILL PROB. GET AN EXTRA ONE TO PASS AROUND."
1,PRETTY LAME FILM!!!,"VERY WEAK STORY,VERY WEAK CAST AND WEAK EXECUTION.IF YOU BELIEVE IN GOD AND WANT TO OWN SOME MORE POWERFUL FILMS THEN I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THE FOLLOWING FILMS:""FACING THE GIANTS"",""FLYWHEEL"",""FIREPROOF AND ""COURAGEOUS""(ALL ARE WONDERFUL FILMS).ALSO I HIGHLY RECOMMEND ""THE BLIND SIDE"".THE ""BLIND SIDE""(A WONDERFUL FILM AS WELL)IS NOT AS SPIRITUAL A FILM AS THE OTHERS I MENTIONED,BUT IT'S SUCH A POWERFUL ""TRUE"" STORY THAT YOU WILL BE VERY MOVED SPIRITUALLY."
1,I was unable to use the CD because it was damaged therefore it should not be rated,"I ordered this CD to use at a Salad and Cinema Luncheon at our church on Aug 22nd. We did not open the CD package until that day, only to find that it was damaged. This was a BIG disappointment. Fortunately our Administrative Assistant was able to stream a movie directly from Net Flex."
5,Learn something new every day,"I have watched this movie time and again and I still find something that I missed the first time around. A great movie with life lessons learned. What's important in life? This movie will make you stop and think about what is really important. Though you may have all the money in the world, if you don't learn a few lessons from this movie, you will never reach your full potential nor real happiness!!"
4,Good Movie,"This was a great heart warming story that I would recommend to just about anyone. Great ratings for the story line and overall compilation of the movie. The only reason I drop it by one star is that in a couple of the scenes the acting wasn't quite as good as I had hoped, but still very much worth watching."
2,Never got the chance,I did not receive this movie but it is a great movie! Buy this movie it has a great and touching story with it! I did not ever receive this movie so that is why I'm giving it two stars. But I have watched it many many times and it is a good movie to watch!
5,surprising quality,"This story was a pleasant surprise! No bad language, no bodies rolling in the sack, no sinister evil villans but a realistic and captivating story of character development and change."
5,THE ULTIMATE GIFT,THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST MEANINGFUL MOVIES FOR PARENTS TO WATCH WITH THEIR CHILDREN. IF PARENTS AND CHILDREN CAN LISTEN AND LEARN IT CAN CHANGE ATTITUDES FROM ENTITLEMENT TO CONTRIBUTION. THE MAJOR SIGNIFICANCE OF THIS IS THAT CONTRIBUTING TO OTHERS IS SO MUCH MORE FULFILLING THAN EXPECTING OTHERS TO GIVE TO YOU BECAUSE OF SOME DISTORTED BELIEF THAT OTHERS OWE YOU SOMETHING. TREATING OTHERS AS THE -ONE- THAT WE ARE TOGETHER IS CRITICAL TO OUR PERSONAL AND CULTURAL DEVELOPMENT.
4,Fantastic,This movie has a hidden message for all who watch. Very heartwarming.I highly recommend the whole family to watch together.
4,ultimate gift DVD,"The DVD is good but not as good as the book--too many changes, like changing the nephew in the book to a grandson in the movie. Still a good story and the movie has excellent actors."
5,Fantastic Feel-Good Movie!! Powerful Message!,"I love this movie - it is actually one of my favorites of all time within its genre.It has a creative plot, a stirring story, fantastic message and it will leave you feeling really great --which is what a movie should do. I love the cast. Get this movie!! Great for the whole family."
5,The Ultimate Gift,This is a very-very good family movie. The acting was excellent!Very good story. We love it!!!
5,The Ultimate Gift,Wonderful! Beautiful story. Great life lessons. Great for kids and adults alike. I hope to see more of Drew Fuller!
5,Wonderful movie!,"This is a great movie with a powerful message! Well done with suspense, love, sorrow, feel good, humorous moments, beautiful scenery and much more. I have recommended this movie to many friends and family who have equally enjoyed it. Ignore the negative comments about this movie, some people love to hate!"
2,sadly amateurish,"a very nice premise, but the acting is quite amateurish. a sweet premise and a happy ending, but the actors are not believable. I watched it because of the high review ratings but it's hard to imagine how people came up with it. the highlight is the little girl."
5,The Ultimate Gift,"This was one of the best movies I've seen, which was a total surprise, since I'd never heard of it before. Not only is it a good movie, but it has so many good life lessons for everyone, and is a movie that any age could enjoy. I rented it originally, watched it three times before I returned it, then came and bought it on Amazon. I bought two copies, one for myself, and one for my sister and her family. I don't think anyone would be sorry for buying this movie for their personal library."
3,fonstad's weakest atlas,"while impressed with the ammount of detail that fonstad put into the middle-earth and dragonlance atlas', the atlas of the land seems almost bland in comparison (most likely because this was fonstad's first book). most of the pages have barely anything on them, and the maps confuse the time periods from both trilogies. the areas are listed by region, seemingly jumping around from place to place and time period to time period seemingly at random, rather than chronilogically from both the covenant books. even worse, there are hardly any cross-sections, which fonstad excelled at with the dragonlance atlas. what a pity. if you're a die-hard covenant fan, this may be worth an absolute maximum of $25, but otherwise you're best suited to your imagination - you will be dissapointed otherwise."
4,Good read,"A good book, but BodyOpus is really only a small section in the back. The sections on drugs and diuretics seem more like a bonus than essential, although I'm not a pro body builder. Lots of detail on biochemistry, written in a bit of an arrogant tone geared towards the alpha male for sure."
2,Good book!,"Really detailed, effective when followed. But I really dont want to die early. You should have the guts to play with your thyroid with this one because he recomends you to take T3's. I wanna be ripped, but i dont want to take the risk. If you are ready to die, just for the sake of being ripped, and buy this book."
5,"FULL of info, legal and otherwise",This is a book for the dedicated person willing to get real serious about body shape and composition. This is not for your mom looking to lose 15 pounds!
4,I liked it,"I was expecting more from this book. Don't get me wrong it was good and I liked it, but I felt like the author (God rest his soul) was egotistical and it sort of put me off. The book is full of good information although some of it is out of date most of it was ahead of it's time. This is a good book to get along with The Ketogenic Diet by Lyle McDonald."
4,Good Advice from a Clear Thinker,"Richard Bernstein became visible to the investing public primarily through his appearances on Wall Street Week with Louis Rukeyser. I always enjoyed his understated yet well thought out commentary and reasoning. Bernstein's advice was refreshingly different from the other panelists. His viewpoint was anchored to income protection rather than growth speculation. With the latest research showing that low-beta, low volatility, low risk stocks that pay dividends are the true champs of the investing universe, Mr. Bernstein has received additional support for his approach of avoiding the hype, not chasing hot stocks, and finding real value. ""Navigating the Noise"" is a touchstone for all investors."
5,Recommended Reading for my clients,"Rich has given me many tools in his well written book to help explain to my clients what is important for investment success. As an investment professional, the greatest value I bring clients is a sense of security that can be achieved if they will concentrate on what is important, rather than the current 'hot' news. Every market period in history has been characterized by near-term uncertainty that, in hindsight, has been shown to be of little consequence for investors with a true long-term time horizon. A very timely book."
5,Explorer Sway Bar Link,I found one broken while doing brake work. Never noticed any problems with control while driving. Bought the part anyway and found it here on Amazon. It was the least expensive on the internet. I had to cut the rest of the old one off and the new one installed easily.
3,"Nice activity, but little song variety","This CD is fine for what it is. Passing the beanbag is a fun activity - especially for special needs children, but this is pretty much a one note song. Don't look for alot of creative ideas for games or activities to do with beanbags. Also, since half of the CD is instrumental versions of the same songs there is not much material here. I was hoping for alot more."
5,NFL Films The Philadelphia Eagles History In Reivew,"My son is a big big Eagles fan....he actually wanted a book on the Eagles history, so finding this DVD was perfect. He was so surprised! He is looking forward to watching it."
2,Lack of Maxi-Aids customer service,"I purchased the watch for a Christmas present for my Mom and, according to Amazon, it was supposed to ship well before Christmas. When I called Maxi-Aids to check on the status, they said it would not ship until 5-7 January and ""it is Amazon's responsibility to tell you."" Needless to say, I was not impressed. I will not buy anything from them in the future."
4,Alison's Legacy,"History, politics, religious conflicts - I liked this believable tale of love, loyalty and reincarnation. It made me reflect on how the past might have affected any of our lives."
3,An educational read about reincarnation,"This novel is about serious issues and poses the controversialquestion of reincarnation. The intense historical research shines inthis accurate depiction of eighteenth century life. Courage in the face of intolerance, adversity, war, and divided loyalties, characterize Alison, a heroin fighting to protect her son. Some may want to prevent readers from discovering this book, probably because the subject makes them uncomfortable, but I would recommend it to any seeker of the ultimate truth. END"
5,Great Book,Janosch's book is a great thing especially when I read it to my two little twins. It always make them think about Panama and establishes an interest for Geography in them. Just buy it!
1,Don't waste your money,"I bought it to control the roach problem, but all it does is make a little audible flicking noise with the blinking light for added effect. I have seen them some gather near the device. I have turned the product on and off when some roaches were nearby, but they've shown no signs of being affected by it. I've had it plugged in for a week now, but still no sign of it working. Maybe it's now safe to conclude that this product simply does not work."
3,the jury is out....,"i had hoped this would work right away but other reviews indicate that i need to wait at least a couple of weeks. in the meantime, it almost seems as if the roaches are drawn to the unit instead of sending them away. i've seen more bugs in the last few days than before i plugged the unit in... and they're bold too. they don't wait for the darkened room anymore.. oh no, they come right out in the daylight and it almost seems as if they're thumbing their noses at me!!! (not that they have thumbs OR noses... but you get my drift) on the positive side, the unit seems to disorient them somewhat so they end up on their backs, or slow down enough for me to kill them. we'll see how it works after the recommended two or three weeks. keeping my fingers crossed."
5,Cinderella's Face Lift,"This is an old classic fairy tale which happens to be my favorite. I love the fact that all the characters came from different ethnic backrounds, which made it the movie interesting. My only complaint was that it was a little on the fast side, but the music, dance sequels, costuming, and the charming chemistry shared by these characters were beautiful. If you want your child to know about true love and hope, I recommend this movie.-S. Abraham"
1,BRANDY IS A BARFBAG!,"I do not want to even fathom the tensions and B.S. that took place on the set of this disastrous flop. When two inflated ego's such as Brandy's and Miss Houston's meet, one imagines a pyrotechnical catastrophe! Those two deserve each other! Natalie Desselle, I must say, is quite charming! Kinda funny, but it seems when in comes to co-stars in her own age bracket, Brandy is constantly surrounding herself those of ""larger proportions"", and you know damn right well she thinks it'll make her look better. But once again the big girl (just like Countess Vaughn in ""Moesha"") steals the show!"
1,Very Poor Adaptation,"Kind of critical to a musical are singers who can act (ideally) or actors who can sing (also great). There is so much of neither in this project. The songs don't translate well to the gravelly, pop-scarred vocal chords of the majority of the cast, most egregiously Brandy, Whoopie and Whitney. A few standouts, though: The prince, B. Peters, Cox, Garber -- most of whom are Broadway musical vets.Such a shame."
3,Good,I love the songs in the movie. I know them word from word. I like this Cinderella because it has the same story line like the cartoon movie does. Unlike other movies.
1,what?,"I must admit, after watching the new version at a friend'shouse, I felt q that it was just strange. I really liked the prince,but the other supporting actors were kind of, well, boring. Further, the music was dull. There was nothing here new, exciting or enticing me to see it again."
1,Just not good!,"I saw this version of Cinderella today, and quite honestly, I was very disappointed. The acting was average, but the scripting and production were much too gaudy. The actors were below average and overall, nothing new or enchanting was added to this production. In general, a waste of time."
4,A great movie with a great soundtrack.,"Although I have never seen the origional, this Cinderella remake blew me away. With so many recognizable faces, and some really fantastic singers like Whitney Houston and Brandy, this musical is one of the best I have seen. Woopie Goldburg plays a part that you would never imagine her in, and plays it well. Whitney Houston is the best fairy godmother I have seen, and the step mother and sisters play an important part in the movie too. If you haven't seen it already, I sugest that you see it ASAP!"
4,"Great music, great spectacle",I have loved this movie since it came out. It is beautiful to watch and the all-star cast is very fun. Lots of talent. My kids also enjoy it.
2,poor thin stuff . . . .,"A weary attempt to multiculturalise an old European legend, lifeless and bland except for a rather cute proformance by Goldberg. Stick with the classic Cartoon version."
1,waste of my time,"The novel is predictable from the beginning and does nothing to stave off the boredom of its predictability. The characters are stereotypical with no modification of the expected. The book exceeds 500 pages when it could have easily been completed in 200. When an author relies so heavily on stereotypes, exaggerated descriptions are completely unnecessary. The writing is stylistically dead; many attempts at being clever made me groan out loud. Stanley Gordon West has created a novel that many obviously adore; I am not one of those. If you got recommendations from a friend who liked this book and you trust that opinion, read it but be prepared to adjust that friendship."
2,Too Annoying!,"Like the other reviewers, I was irritated by the author's overuse of similes; and for me, they did seriously detract from my enjoyment of the story. This is a great little story; the characters and place are well done, and West makes you care about them. However, every time I would get drawn into the story, start to lose myself in it, here would come the avalanche of similes (some of them very bad)! Please, Mr. West, you are a good enough writer to do without this overload!"
3,"should be called ""Partial interchange manual""",This book is informative and easy to use However it does not cover the majority of body/structure parts nor does it cover all of the Chevrolet models. I own a 1970 Monte carlo and purchased this book to find out what reproduction or used parts would fit but it does not really cover this model. The only place I found anything about the Monte Carlo is in the Chevelle section and that is minimal! in addition there is nothing on 70 chevelle body structure much less 70 Monte. Other models/years are covered although not completly. Overall the information that is there is accurate but for the price I was expecting something that covered all the models that are in the year range listed as well as a more complete listing of the cars/years that are in the book. I have seen a Hollander exchange manual for several different years of cars and it covers a huge amount more than this book.
2,The 3rd season was disappointing,The 3rd season was sort of a downer. It was more mystical that I would have wanted. Also killing off Megan Gallager was a big mistake.
4,To clear things up,"First let me say I enjoyed this movie, not for the acting or the writing but mostly for the realistic vision of my child hood memories on the screen. If you have never seen transformers or know nothing about them then you will enjoy this more than some, I was disapointed in some areas ill say for sure.I have read alot of god awful reviews on this movie most saying they diddnt like it because""oh like that would happen!"" this movie is about robots from space!? of course it would never happen its a movie!!! take this movie as it is a movie. Clique in parts funny in other fart joke here its just a standard movie nothing overwhelmingly special but definitly not the worst movie ever made watch lady in the water now thats a negative 5 stars."
5,Amazing movie,"First of all, to all the haters. If you hated the movie, don't buy it. If you didn't buy it or see the DVD then you have no right to give this a terrible review. Why bother putting down a movie that was well made and most people like. If you like complaining, and criticizing things, then criticize yourself, because you need help.Now as for the movie. I loved the movie! It was very well-made and entertaining. Such high standards are held for movies now, but remember that movies are simply stories told to entertain. If a movie entertains its viewers, then it has succeeded in its purpose. Transformers was very detailed; the computer animation was the best I've ever seen in any movie; the plot was intricate; the acting was great; it was very funny; and it held my attention. I thought it was the best movie since 300.The 2-disc special edition DVD is well made. They put a lot of time and effort into it and it paid off. Amazing. I'd recommend this movie to anyone who loves to be entertained."
1,"Stupid movie, but the kids like it","This movie is so pathetic! The ONLY way I can enjoy it is by reducing my logic to a mere minimum. Dumb yourself down, WAY down if you plan on sitting through its entirety.On the other hand, my kids (13 and 7) thoroughly enjoyed it. My oldest likes it mostly because of the hot babe character. My youngest likes it, well, because he's a child."
1,This is an insult to Transformers,"As a fan of Transformers going back to 1984, I was highly disappointed with this movie. The only good thing about it was the quality of the CGI used to render the robots, despite the poor designs of said robots. The plot was a typical action movie plot, with no development. Most of the robots, who were little more than guest stars in their own movie, got no character development. On top of that, you have a story that treated the franchise, which has been successful for 20+ years, with little to no respect. All in all, this movie was not even close to what I was hoping for, but it was everything I was expecting and less. This was the wrong team for this movie, and the movie shows it. If you have an IQ, avoid this movie."
4,Good value for a single DVD,"I usually get the 2-disc special edition DVD sets, but I realize that I never watch the 2nd DVD a second time so I went with the single DVD. For the value, it's worth it though I was disappointed that the DVD came in a clear case that wasn't special in any way. The paper cover looks just like the image shown. But eh, I wanted the DVD not the special case or special DVD promoted by Walmart, Target, and other retailers who have different versions of ""special"". Go to those stores if you're a collector, this version is for those who just want the movie."
4,Better Than Expected!,"Admittedly, I bought this one used from a local video store and my expectations were low. What got me on-board for this film was the opening when Peter Cullen's voice came behind the words! For those that don't know, Peter was the original voice of Optimus Prime from the old Transformers animated series from the 1980's! I didn't even know he was even still alive but I am glad they got him back to play Optimus! I marked out immediately!Anyway, from that point on, I was into the film. I liked that they kept certain elements of both the comic book and animated series such as the connection to the Whipwicky family (sorry if the name is spelled wrong) and ""sparks"" (the heartbeats of both the Autobots and Decepticons). Granted, some changes were made but not enough to make me hate this film.Overall, I liked this experience! While I am biased towards the other Transformers film (which was animated), this live action one is pretty good! Worth the price new or used."
3,not bad and not good,"Opening speed is very high but after 30min, very slower. Target age might be younger."
5,Greatest Movie Ever,This is one of the greatest movies ever made. I bought it and love it. My son and I just get glued to the tv and won't even take a break. I've watched it over 5 times already. Coool
5,Pure Awesomeness!,"You don't have to be a kid to love this movie. this just brings up memories of the original cartoon series, and Michael Bay does justice to the original.Product arrvied by set date in fantastic condition, a movie all must watched and all must own."
3,HD DVD does not measure up to such a spectacular show,"Before I begin I would like to note that I think Transformers is one of the best movies ever made. The HD DVD version, however, is Audio GARBAGE! It is equiped with Dolby Digital Plus. Dolby Digital Plus?! Not Dolby TrueHD like it should be. The sound during the movie's action scenes is only as loud as the diologue, and not louder as it should be. Videowise though, the picture is stunning. Overall, if you prefer video to sound pick this up. If sound is really important, don't waste your money."
2,enjoyable,"although the movie visuals were cool, the writing lacked a lot. there were also lots of scenes that were thrown together for laughs, that were just really, really STUPID!! spend time with spidey, captain jack, or the silver surfer all are better choices."
1,Michael Bay Does It Again,"This is the most formulaic summer movie I have ever seen. Stuffed full with celebrity cameos, overblown special effects, and blatant product placement. It's more a 2 1/2 hour GM commercial than a film.The characters are all one dimensional and the plot is predictable so I never really got into the film. I know for sure I will never watch a Michael Bay movie again having been disapointed for the last time. Also Shia LaBeouf is the most ridiculous leading actor in a movie since DJ Qualls in ""The New Guy""."
5,Great Movie,"Is a great fan version, but not have deleted scenes in the dvd, for this you can visit official web site and get access to bonus content, for fans is highly recommended, ,I'm very satisfied with this product."
1,It is HD DVD..... Do not buy it if you do not have an HD DVD player!,DO NOT BUY! I think the website should bear a warning sign on it stating that the product is an HD DVD. I only realized that I cannot play it after I inserted it in my player. HD DVD is almost eliminated from the market. Blue ray take the dominance.
1,Not for fans of the original Transformers series/toys/comic,"I can't believe anyone likes this movie. So lame. 5 autobots vs 5 decepticons. Wow. Epic. The robots were horribly designed. I could barely tell they were robots after they transformed (a process that appears like it should take several hours). And autobots are f'ing buicks and oldsmobiles. C'mon, Jazz is a freaking pontiac instead of a porsche? Starscream was okay, and it was nice to use the original Optimus' voice, but those are about the only redeeming features of this typical Michael Bay crapfest. Bring on the 1080p release of the animated masterpiece, ""Transformers: The Movie!"""
5,transformers revenge of the fallen,Its always great shoping with amazon transformer is a great movie its my kind of movie I can't wait for part 3 to come out thank you .
2,Independence Day Re-hash with Mechanical Aliens,"It is definitely to the point of cinema's history where good effects can override a good story and that's all it takes to sell tickets, DVD's, merchandise, etc. I thought it was ironic that this came out on Independence Day weekend, considering how much of the plot followed that movie. I could spend paragraphs making the comparisons, but I guess I'll be outnumbered here anywho.My pre-teen sons loved it and it was mostly appropriate for their age. Even if they were teenagers, as the PG-13 rating suggests, I would still consider certain aspects of this story inappropriate for minors. (Thank goodness for ClearPlay!!) It boggles my mind why they make a PG-13 movie from a children's cartoon series with obvious children's toy tie-ins. Actually, it doesn't boggle my mind, since I understand Hollywood's agenda fairly well... Sell _______ at any social cost."
3,DECENT ENOUGH,"Having grown up watching the original Transformers cartoons, it's hard to admit certain things about this film.True there are a few well made action scenes and the CGI work is some of the most intricate on celluloid yet.However,the films achilles heel is both the script and CGI.There has obviously been too much time and energy invested on the films teenage chracters.This is not American Pie or an episode of High School Stories...this is Transformers.Also,the CGI work is so advanced that yes,though every little part moves and operates individually,the final shot is one of thousands of undecernable pixels smashing into each other.Though the humor was suprisingly good and present throughout the film,the directors choice to over-modernize a good series with yet more Linkin Park songs and irritating teenagers may turn off fans of the original series.It's a decent film,it's just not about the bots."
4,Transformers,"My son wanted this movie and I wasn't interested in watching it, but within the first 5 minutes I was hooked. The special effects are unbelievable. Shia Labeouf is proving himself to be a talented and up and coming actor, although he seems to be typecast in these ""kid"" oriented movies. Tune in for the robots, action and special effects if nothing else."
1,A very dull movie considering how much stuff they blow up,"A fairly dull movie, with inconsistent acting and writing. If you're a transformers fan it's worth the rental, otherwise just skip it."
5,Stunning,"Stunning is the word. The picture on this HD-DVD is one of the best in my collection, and the sound is the best non-PCM I've ever heard."
4,"Entertaining, but understandably predictable.","I doubt this review will be very useful, as the sequel is near release. I did enjoy this movie. Excellent special effects. A nice mix of humor. My only, (tiny,) complaint is that the plot was predictable. I understand why, as the movie is based on a very established story line. Overall, I liked it, and recommend this to a friend."
5,CHildhood fantasy relived and updated,This is definitely my number 1 favorite right now. If they hadn't used the same guy for Optimus then it would not have had nearly the same effect. The CG effects are phenomenal - the best I've seen of any film today. It almost makes me believe that Transformers are real and they do exist among us hiding in plain sight. I love this movie; it's like reliving my childhood imagination all over again every time I watch it.
5,Transformers,Transformers on blu-ray is great. Bay did a wonderful job on bringing a childhood favorite to life. Shia LaBeouf and Megan Fox did a break out job in their roles. Plus and the features that BD-Live adds new info which adds so much more to the movie.
2,So Insanely Boring,"The thing I hate about Michael Bay movies is that the characters are always stereotypes. For example, every black character must say stupid things like ""Damn"" or ""This s*** is crazy.""Pile on top of that the fact that this movie is about an hour longer than anything based on Transformers should ever be. The fact that they tried to create a plot, but somehow the movie is plotless still baffles me.All in all, it's a Michael bay movie. Explosions over substance, overly tanned caricatures with zero motivations, a world basked in endless magic hour glow, and a story that makes you want to smack your head against a brick wall repeatedly."
4,Awesome!!!!!,"I got this in local store!!! I didnt make it to watch it in the theaters!! But nvtheless, watching it on Blu-ray is AWESOME!!!!!!!!"
4,Fun Movie,"For me, movies are usually a form of entertainment to escape a little while. An opportunity to take the kids somewhere and do a little bonding time. This movie does that very well. Yes there may be issues with practicality of the 'science' involved, but the characters are engaging, the action is pretty much non-stop, and the special effects are superb, especially in Blu-Ray.I have seen all three of the movies now and the quality is consistent throughout the set. I own the first two and will buy the third movie when it is relased. Very entertaining franchise."
3,Pubescent Hormones and Robots Run Amok,"While it's amusing enough, and the effects are impeccable, there's little doubt about the age of the intended audience. Every adult in the film is a clueless buffoon or an officious wacko.Whether apparently flirty bimbos or bookish babes, the girls are the intelligent ones while the ""guys"" are walking blobs of hormones and machismo.It's a nice bit of overblown fun even if it can't decide whether to be a serious thriller or a comedic adventure."
2,This film has one plus point...,"...yes, you've guessed it, you clever people, the astonishing visual effects. Everything else is simplistic nonsense."
4,Very Entertaining,"I didn't quite know what to expect with this movie but I was pleasantly surprised Transformers turned out to be a very entertaining movie. First, this is not Gone With The Wind, it's Transformers, take it for what it is and enjoy it. You will find humor, action, clever ideas and, of course, special effects. I liked how the movie developed the relationship between the boy and his car, going from almost chance purchase to close companions. Transformers will probably be classified as a Sci-Fi, and it does satisfy that, but it really is more and I believe if you give it a chance you will also find yourself entertained."
2,Huge Let Down for Transformers Fans,"As a fan of the Transformers cartoons, I was worried when I heard Michael Bay was directing the film. I did have some hope though since Spielberg was somewhat involved though. Too bad the movie was molded more from the creative liberties of Michael Bay's ego than it's source material.Some things that made this movie suck: Bumblebee playing cupid despite having more pressing things to worry about like Decipticons, Starscream's lack of any personality especially since he was one of the most entertaining personalities on the show, Optimus Prime tip toe'ing around a garden like a worried soccer mom, Barricade just kinda dissapears, Sector 7 was stupid, the government drama was horrible, the transformers seemed like more of an afterthought since they only came out a few times.If you liked the movie, great. Enjoy it. But I found it butchered by Michael Bay."
5,Buy the DVD,"If you are big fan of the Transformers show you will like this movie, I know some people say it's different from the cartoon TV show, but still you can't give bad reviews for such a nice movie. Buy it today"
5,Great movie gets better on Blu-ray,"This is a great movie. Many people already know that. On Blu-ray, it gets even better with the clarity of both the picture and sound. It's quite amazing how much better Transformers looks on Blu-ray. I own both the normal DVD (because it wasn't released on Blu-ray on the day of the release) and the Blu-ray. Even when the DVD was upscaled, it doesn't come close to the Blu-ray."
4,A Sweet Movie,"This is a sweet movie that shows a young woman overcoming prejudice and strife as a young German wife who travels to America for a pre-arranged marriage to a farmer she's never met. When the preacher refuses to marry them, it's only the beginning of the struggle. Farmers in the community fight to hold onto their farms during financial hardships, and their friendships. I did find it confusing when they flashed forward to the grandson. I don't think enough details were filled in on that relationship, but it was still a wonderful movie.Chrissy K. McVay - Author"
3,Too Slow,"I watched this based on all the great reviews. After watching, I have no idea what you all are talking about. I just found it to be too slow and a little boring, and I watch all kinds of movies. Having said that, if you liked this movie, you'd also probably like ""The Polish Bride"" - it's a Dutch film - and that one I liked."
2,You'll Be Sorry,"This movie was interminably slow and I couldn't get past the heavy-handed anti-religion, anti-American, pro-Socialist agenda. This is a propaganda film, made by Marxists, for Marxists.The multiple flashbacks to different time periods are done badly and as a result are confusing. The plot is implausible. The emotional range of the film is one note: solemn. It's like going to the symphony and listening to them play C minor for two hours. The only joyful scene is run behind the credits. One big WTF."
5,I Can Animate!,"Coming from somebody who has always loved cartoons, but wasn't blessed with the talent to actually draw on paper, this software is great! I plan on using it to actually be able to animate my own pilot projects now without having to hire a bunch of animators to do it. Of course when they get picked up I will let the pros have some fun with this program as well. I used it to create a commercial for a client and they loved it. Mind you it is still on the simple side, but it was great to be able to see my own creation come to life. Now if only I can take the time to sit down and go through the manual step by step (which seems a bit lengthy, but it illustrates everything out), I bet I will love this program even more. Have fun with it and let your imagination run wild!"
4,Doo be doo be doo...,"""Strangers in the Night"" was Frank Sinatra's first big hit single since ""Witchcraft"", eight years earlier. Some people apparently don't care for the song, but it did win the Grammy for Record of the Year (for what it's worth). Back in the 1960s, when someone had a smash hit single they would usually title the subsequent album after it, which is the case here. The album also includes the follow up single, ""Summer Wind"", which was also a hit, albeit not as big a one. The rest of the album features a seemingly random mix of songs, some old and some new. Sinatra sings the songs well, but some of the songs don't really suit him, like ""Downtown"" and ""Yes Sir, That's My Baby"". Overall, a pretty good album, albeit a short one (27 minutes long)."
4,A much better album than the title track!!,"The title track (and 'Downtown'!) are so '60s that it is easy to overlook some really good songs here, including a remake of 'All or Nothing at All' that is very fun and not bad at all. 'Summer Wind' is just perfect, and I think this might have been FS' joke after all -- a '60s album that managed to squeeze in some excellent music behind a commerical facade."
3,Too easy and not good quality,"I bought this for my 4 yr. old, who loves Thomas. He enjoyed putting together, but I quickly realized it was too easy. He now can put together in about 10 minutes. Good picture quality, but not happy with the cardboard material. Puzzle got a little wet, started buckling and picture started to tear off. I will now have to glue the picture back on for future play. Not made of a good quality, next time I will not buy cardboard."
3,The Real Deal? Not Really,"I read Ford's book after my good friend Bob Dorr claimed that the author had ""settled for once and for all"" the claims that Claire Chennault had shot down Japanese airplanes before the formation of the AVG. While Ford is a good writer and story teller, he discredited all of his points in the final chapter where he admitted that ""the Japanese viewpoint"" and their ""actual losses"" were mostly his assumptions based on some incomplete records that were captured by US forces in New Guinea more than a year after the AVG was disbanded. There is too much journalism and not enough solid history in Ford's book. It's a good read for those who are interested in the Flying Tigers but take Ford's claims with a grain of salt."
5,The Best on the Best,"Dan Ford's book on the Flying Tigers is not only fascinating, but factual. I've read just about everything there is on the AVG, including Pappy Boyington's obscure novel, and Ford makes most other work take second place. The story of the AVG is one of the great romantic, adventure stories in American aviation history. And, for the most part, that is how it has been portrayed leaving one to wonder what really happened out there in those skies over China and Burma so long ago? The only criticism I would have is that I am sure there is some things that the author left out, mainly on the mercenary nature of the venture. I wish Ford would do an update to this work which will stand as an important contribution to aviation history."
2,"Bad taste, not believable","This movie seems like part of a trend among many recent romantic comedies to substitute vulgarity and silliness for true comedy. The plot twists were often unbelievable, even for a romantic comedy. At several points, people make out wildly in restaurants, jumping on top of each other and groping wildly (which I've frankly never seen in a public restaurant). After the first 5 minutes there was little change in the plot and the ending was an entirely predictable. Throughout the movie, I felt like the main characters were almost purposely miscommunicating simply because they had to propel the plot. Not worth your time - there are plenty of other romantic comedies about unexpected pregnancies."
4,enjoyed,"Really liked this book, love the Napa Valley and love to read a good mystery. with romance it was just fun"
4,More great BLUES from JON BUTCHER,"This is my 2nd JON BUTCHER CD and looking at the used prices, may well be the best value for money BLUES cd on the market.This is good solid rocking electric blues by a great guitarist.Not all songs are top drawer, but there are some standouts and the overall quality is excellent. If you like the guitar and the BLUES, you can't go wrong, this delivers."
1,Who is this person?????,"I urge anyone contemplating purchasing this book to reread the authors bio...20 years as a healthcare activist? What does this mean? She writes letters to people? She has published articles? Now she is writing a book that will make irresponsible parents feel better about risking their children's lives? I agree with the other reviewer who suggests we all read the Paul Offit book that I originally signed on to Amazon to purchase. He is a physician who is a Vaccine Researcher. I am a Registered Nurse of 14 years, mother of five vaccinated children and work in a pediatric office. I am sick and tired of random women calling themselves experts in the field of vaccination research while leading others to believe that the healthcare industry is lying to them. I suggest you educate yourself with medical facts based on real research, which is what I'm going to do by reading the Offit book."
3,The Pretender Movies,"Both full-length movies were good in that they picked off where the series ended with most cast members returning. However, the mysteries are still not solved and one can only wonder if another movie sewing up the loose ends will be made so that the fans of The Pretender can finally put it to bed."
5,More,It was a good 2 movies. However i think that the studio should have gone ahead and done all four that they planned to. In true pretender fashion more questions are raised than answered.
4,Would Have Liked Some Bonus Materials,"Great addition to any THE PRETENDER collection. Video/audio quality are quite good, although the transitions betweens scenes are a bit jarring where the commercials originally went. Makes them feel a bit less like movies than just extended episodes.The one big thing missing is any commentary or behind-the-scenes type bonus material or even a gag reel. The other 4 collections/seasons each had a little something spread throughout, so was hoping for the same here. (Maybe they hid something as an 'easter egg' but I have yet to find anything...)Overall, it's nice to finally have the last 2 pieces to the series. Now if they would only come out with a 3rd movie or an official book to tie up all the loose ends, including the new ones brought up by the movies that were supposed to 'answer all'! =)The Pretender 2001 / The Pretender - Island of the Haunted"
4,The Pretender TV Movies A Nice Addition For Fans,"I missed these two movies when they were on television. As a continuation of the story these movies created more questions than they did answers, however I loved the series so I loved the movies and in all honesty I like imagining my own answers to the questions left by The Pretender series. It leaves me happier than anything the writers could have come up with. I loved Micheal T. Weiss with longer hair...I thought it gave him more of an independent/rebellious look instead of the institutional short cut he had in the series. After all, Jarod is suppose to be finding his own identity away from the Centre. Anyway, if your like me and loved the series and have all four years of it on DVD, your collection wouldn't be complete with out these films."
5,The Pretender,"What an amazing film[s] this is, and an amazing series i just wish that there was a nice happy ending for Jarod"
5,"Jarod, what more can i say","I was slighttly dissapointed as it didnt have an ending and I really didnt like his hair in these movies, but overall I am and always will be a fan of The Pretender so of course I loved the movies for what they were."
4,Got to Love The Pretender,Of course only more questions are raised and answers to those questions and the others before it...yea still waiting for them to be answered. But you have to love The Pretender
1,Poor Sound Quality,"I thought this was some kind of joke, offering a HQ SHM-CD, by Universal Music (Japan), and the sound quality of my favorite tune, ""That's Life"", sounds utterly bad! I assume, whoever is behind Frank Sinatra Enterprises, LLC, is the primary culprit. It's sad, Frank was such as great singer, but, on CD, it makes you question if his session tapes are lost/destroyed. Sounds the same as on budget CD. Save your money."
4,Gardening Books,We are new the Las Vegas and being from the northwest this book has been very helpful.
2,Zzzzzzz!,"This books starts out interesting but in the middle gets REALLY SLOW - the only action being everybody's mouths flapping nonstop. I kept skipping ahead to see if anything interesting would ever happen again but it never did. Endless philosophizing, women ""bonding"" with each other, everybody preaching to each other, on and on ad nauseum. In real life these people would never have made it across the country because they spent 90% of their time talking."
3,Good book.,"I read a couple of reviews stating that this book didn't hold a lot of suspense or drama. That's true. I did find it a bit slow at times but I also found it very much worth finishing and if you are interested in the westward expansion, this book has some factual information about it. The insight into the characters helped to spur me on to finishing it and even though its a slow and steady read without huge drama...I look forward to reading the other books in the series."
4,A Good Read,"I enjoyed this book and really enjoyed the detail that Jane Kirkpatrick gave her characters. I looked forward to Ruth, Mazy, Suzanne, Sister Esther, Elizabeth, and the others.I learned something of what it took to move west in the 1850's. Before I finished this book, I bought 'No Eye Can See' so I can continue with this story."
2,Needs Depth,"I found this book boring. The plot is slow in developing, and the characters are very one-dimensional. The cast of characters reminds me of those disaster movies: someone is pregnant, someone is not really who she appears to be, there is a preacher-type character, another is blind. The episodic jumps in the chapters continually interrupt the flow of the narrative. I only give this two stars because the premise is interesting; it's a shame it wasn't well-developed. Are all ""women's"" novels this sappy?"
5,I couldn't put this down.,This is one of my current favorite books. Women going west with spouses & other family are thrown into fending for themselves when all the men either die or leave their wagon train. These women get to know each others strengths and weaknesses and are able to cooperate to get themselves west.
5,All Together in One Place and No Eye Can See,"Immediately I felt I was making the long journey over the Oregon Trail with Mazy, Tipton, Suzanne and the ""so full of myself"" Adora; as well as the men and children that were a part of these families. They are stories of courage, faith and giving of each other when they thought there was nothing else to give. These women are the real ""survivors"". Since I have finally washed the dust from my eyes from following the wagons over the many miles they traveled, I eagerly await book 3 in the Kinship and Courage series by Jane Kirkpatrick."
4,Ramage and the Guillotine,"Not as good as the volumes 1 thru 4 but better than 5, but I liked it because I'm a Ramage fan"
3,will not fit impact door,did some research and this door although a great solution will not fit hurricane impact doors as interior frame of doors is too wide to accommodate this blind
2,Its ok,You cant see the dot in the daylight unless your in a building. So I just basically use it to mess with my cat now. But its great for house to house combat.
1,A Waste,"You get what you pay for.After about an hour of trying to sight it in I gave up! It's impossible,it's junk,don't waste your money."
4,Great for the price @ Amazon,"I purchased this item for my 9 inch barrel .22 revolver. The item fit perfect on the barrel without any problems. However, the laser was a little loose. One wrap with duck tape and the laser was secure. I zeroed in within one inch without a bore site. I'm plinking at night and enjoying this little laser. The laser works well in low light with lots of distance. I gave this Item 4 stars because the laser was loose and needed a fix on my part"
3,eh.,"It's not the best by far, but it's fun to play around with. Not very bright but some how I rigged it to my flatline barrel on my A-5 but it was VERY tricky because the srews it comes with where no where near long enough for the job. Not for up scale work and not completely accurate, but for just messing around I've got no complaints."
4,Praise from a comic strip fan,My Garfield collection is not complete but it's up there. The fact that Jim Davis can come up with enough comic strip ideas to fill 40 books and keep them as funny as he has explains why he's been around for as long as he has. To fans of comic strips I say this book is truly worth a look. To fans of Garfield it's a must have.
4,This is a good TAB book,"It features accurate TABS, but does miss out on ""Under My Skin"" I won't get into the details of it, but it is not correct to the actual song."
5,Knit kit,I ordered this kit for my granddaughter for Christmas. She just learned to knit and wants to knit a scarf.
1,Works great until,"Works great until it suddendly gives out on you. I had this thing installed in my machine for the better part of three years I would say and while it worked it did its job just fine (although noticeably more slowly then has been my experience from onboard raid controllers).However given the type of product that this is, it is unacceptable for the product to last only three years. I just lost all my information and am an unhappy camper.Buyer Beware."
3,"Great season, poor DVD","In an age when improved video quality is a must, this DVD release takes a HUGE step backwards. The lack of quality is so annoying in parts that it's almost unwatchable. As other reviews have stated, there is a major problem with the compression. I like that F1 wants to give us as much on a disk as possible...why not put it on 2 disks so the quality doesn't suffer? The disk is worth viewing once. I'm glad I rented this first and I don't plan on owning it based on quality and not the content. I own the 2000, '03, '04 and '05 disks and the quality dropped after the 2004 disk. Hopefully they get it right for the 2007 disk."
4,F1 2006,"If you enjoy F1, this is the DVD to get! It's a good general recap of the season and shows how teams prepare for, practice, and conduct pit stops and refueling."
5,Love this!!!!,My horse grows a winter coat like a draft breed so I was interested in finding some help to remove all that hair. This tool is the best thing I have ever tried. Much better than a curry comb or stiff brush. Removes huge quantities of hair at a time and it is easy to knock the hair out by tapping the furminator on a nearby tree or wall.And on top of that he seems to enjoy it.
2,A little better than a shedding blade,"The Furminator Equine is not a miracle tool but it does seem to work a little better than a standard shedding blade. It was $20 more expensive at my local tack store, so I definitely got a good deal buying it on Amazon."
1,"Quite a bit ""forced""","The album overall seems a bit ""forced""; in that the real classic prog bands incorporated harmonies and time signature/tempo changes in a way that fit the song. It seems like these guys are just trying to ""wow"" fellow prog-rock nerds that they actually stuck to their Mel Bay books."
1,Miss Leading,"I was expecting a James Bond 007 movie and got a poor made movie of Roger Moore. I think it needs to be removed from the James Bond category. Roger Moore was the worst James Bond and I didn't want a ""B"" movie that Roger Moore made when I was ordering the James Bond 007 series type movies."
5,Charming and Entertaining!,"This movie is one I could watch over and over. It's creative, inspirational, and fun! If you enjoy documentaries about arts groups and children, this is right up your alley!"
4,Thoughts from an old Giant fan.,For current but especially past fans this is an excellent trip down memory lane with a team with a great tradition. Well worth the time to see and see again.
1,What a disappointment!,"First let me say I like James Burke. Currently I am watching his series ""The Day the Universe Changed"" It's excellent. The problem with this tape is his premise with evolution, It's only a theory, but Mr Burke goes on for the whole of side one about evolution as if it were fact. Then with side four it's nothing but doom & gloom. Mr Burke stick with history. Science & telling the future is not your forte."
2,Buy something else,"Usually I love Dummies books but this one is definitely not up to my usual expectations with this series. Author not the best teacher, at least for me. For example, describes things in a paragraph supposedly shown in accompanying picture, but item not there. Too late to return this, I'm going out to buy something else. Note: I don't think it's just this edition but the author's lack of care, and/or need for more thoughtful editing. As the title says, don't buy this one. Hope the author/editor rework this to bring it up to the usual quality of Dummies books, which shouldn't be that difficult to do. I realize a lot of work went into it already."
1,Incomplete.....intermediate.,"This book has an english word followed by a transliteration in Bosnian then from one to four words that SHOULD be translations. BUT...you find the words are derivatives of the word but take on a different meaning the word. For instance, ""sit"" will cover ""sit on the table"", ""I will sit here"", and then ""Sit down"". (This is an example as I was talking to a Bosnian interpretor and she quickly corrected me on just one of the variations i.e. sjesti=Sit down. But there is NO way of telling what the context of the word is. There are alot of commone words missing that you would expect any other kind of dictionary to contain."
3,WARNING! Cheaper edition available,"You can buy a cheaper version of this dictionary by the same author, the same publisher, the same number of pages, and the same number of words.The cheaper version is the Bosnian-English, English-Bosnian Hippocrene COMPACT dictionary. (Yes, the page size and type are smaller, but if you have normal eyesight, it will do just fine.)If you want to save a few bucks, go with the COMPACT edition."
4,Good homage to a classic,"Not exactly a stealth keyboard, but good tactile feedback - which I prefer as a touch-typist and decades-long fan of the classic IBM 101 keyboard.Has a lot of intriguing extra function buttons, which I haven't gotten around to investigating yet (and probably won't -- except for the handy volume controls!)"
4,Nephews Loved It!!,My 9yr old and 5yr old nephews loved this DVD! They live in Texas and I'm all the way in CA. My sister said that the DVD was in great condition and that my nephews laughed and were sitting at the edge of their seats the whole movie through.
5,Forget about the facts,"This movie is about the best 3D animation ever and the best computerized special effects, So what if they said unproved stuff, The movie is worth for its special effects alone!"
4,What a neat film on dinosaurs!,"This is a good film about dinosaurs, i saw jurassic park and really liked it but now this is much better. This is better because the dinosaurs are the main thing in it. They look real and are very interesting in their stories. I would recommend this for other children but not too young because there are some scenes that might make them afraid or unhappy to be seeing dinosaurs killed by other dinosaurs. The Dinosaurs are very colorful and have great detail, including how they lived-what they ate-and how they moved around. I would say you should look into buying or renting this because it is a whole new level in special effects and very very enjoyable."
4,Dinasaurs Ruled this does too,"This movie tells an evolutionary story with effects of Spielberg quality. Hip-hip-hurray to BBC. The only negative statement is I wish this was one continuous movie without interruption. I would rate this movie 5 stars if that one change was made. I really appreciated the perspective from which many shots were taken (looking around a tree, through bushes, from above, below etc.) It made it seem as if I were there. The BBC continues its history of educational television with the addition of realism via outstanding FX."
2,"Interesting, but a waste","I bought this dvd because it said there were live performances on it. Not a one. It showed clips from music videos, and the staged portions of the Sign O' The Times film, but nothing live. David Rivkin was the only really interesting interview. Everyone else was pretty much filler. Don't waste your time unless you are truly a new Prince fan. It wasn't awful, but nowhere near worth the asking price."
4,so far so good,Ordered my size which was a 36x36.. length was fine but waist was tight.. so beware that they may run a little small.. returned them for exchange which was no problem... received the replacement pair a couple of weeks later and they fit great... have not used them as of yet but the material is rugged and fairly comfortable. I previously had been working in Levi's 505's that were fading and hole-ing up after about two months of wash and work so I am anxious to see how these work out... unfortunately my work season that these were purchased for is over so I'll have to wait till the winter before I give these a whirl but they seem to be the answer to my problem..
5,Great Pants!!,I have ordered these before and love them. They are made well and fit great!Great for my woodworking hobby and my son is a photographer so perfect for himas well. They look great to wear out for a nice causal look with a sweater or whatever.G.Dustman
5,Great Work Pants,I work in construction as a surveyor. I spend most of my days hiking up and down slopes. These pants give the greatest flexibility for moving that I have found. They also don't get shredded by brush as fast as regular jeans. Plus they are lighter than jeans. I own several pairs and they are my preferred choice for work wear.
3,Color,Just received them and havent even tried them on but the color is different then the picture its more of a green
2,Not the color shown,"These pants are green, and very dark compared to the picture... Otherwise they are okay > > > Buyer Beware!!!!"
5,Best Work Pants I Ever Bought.,"Living in Australia these are the first clothing I have bought online from the U.S. I was delighted with the quality. Far superior to anything I can buy localy at far better price. Only a little more expensive than I could have have bought a similar item at a local K Mart but a far far higher quality. These pants are generously but well cut and the materiel is as tough as leather. As a retiree I originally purchased them for odd jobs about the house and garden but they look so good I am wearing them for shopping, casual occaisions etc and have had friends comment favourably on them. Would recommend these to anybody and have already done so. Glad I bought 2 pairs a great buy."
5,Interesting and Well Depicted,I constantly see books that depict intelligence and diplomacy as James Bondish in nature. It's refreshing to see someone who can shead some literary light onto the DAS and express the excitement and intrigue without fancy gadgets and fantasy characters.
4,The Defense Attache Service elaborately described!!,"A most informative and interesting book about the Defense Attache Service(DAS). The story is told through the eyes and thoughts of a new DAS Commander who took command in the mid 1980's. This arm of the U.S. Military is made up of talent from all the services as the Attaches collect useful data for our government from assignments in over 100 countries. Although a fictional story, it is apparent that the described events were inspired by similar actual happenings including terrorism, espionage, and the very serious problems caused by a mole in one of the intelligence services. A dividend is the well written description of the cities around the world that the Commander visits in meeting and evaluating Personnel."
5,The Making of a Therapist,"Excellent book; a must read for anyone considering becoming a therapist. Written from an incredibly straightforward and personally honest account, Dr. Cozolino gets to the core of what it feels like to be a new therapist. I felt as if he had been able to read my mind as he repeatedly addressed the many concerns I was having. I was immediately reassured and am sure to read this book over and over again!"
3,"Good, but not the best by the group","A shame that Columbia refuses to re-issue their first MONSTER self-titled album in proper fasion. Admttedly, this contains most of that album, but to omit the incredible ""Juana Mil Ciento"" from this CD is criminal! Admittedly, however- this is a good intro to a band that was one of the driving factors of the Cuban music scene in the 80's. This horn section could have knocked down the walls of Jericho, along with that other ensemble from 2000 years ago..."
2,im almost sorry i was sucked into this one,i listen to the later buddha bar stuff and like it A LOT more than this one. its not all that grand.
1,IMPORTANT,"the buddha-bar earns much of its profits from its series of restaurants around the world. I strongly urge all those who hold respect and admiration towards The Buddha to avoid purchasing any buddha-bar music or paying visits to any of its restaurants. Many aspects of the restaurants ridicule and humiliate the Buddha- for instance the buttocks of the buddha is used as a fountain to pour drinks. To all those who respect the Buddhist philosophy, refrain from investing your money in this awfully disrespectful and humiliating group. Many buddhist countries have expressed their disgust at certain aspects this buddha-bar uses in its humiliation of the Buddha."
2,Never underestimate the power of marketing,"This is a mediocre sampling of what the Middle East and Asia has to offer as far as lounge music goes; traditional sounding vocals, chanting, and far eastern accoustic instruments, packaged in a cool box with the notoriety that it came from a nightclub in PARIS!! My question is: how could anyone justify charging this much for a couple of CDs?Some people would be proud to buy an unmarked CD in a brown paper bag because it's the music they are buying--others buy music to belong to the group or hype that surrounds it, or simply to see the cover sitting on their shelf. Buddha Bar is the personification of the latter and were it not for the pretty package, no one would pay 25 cents for this stuff.Go ahead, defy me and enjoy..fortunately there are enough fans that I was able to resell all 4 of my Buddha Bar series right here on Amazon and was able to buy three times as many CDs with the profit. To anyone else: you've been warned.."
2,no para bebes,"Me gusta la musica barroca y pense que este seria un buen CD para introducirla a mi bebe pero me desilusione desde la primera cancion. Tiene muchos altos y bajos, demasiadas variantes en los sonidos, lo cual no lo encuentro recomendable para bebes pues puede despertarle al cambiar la tonalidad de una cancion a otra. Encontre que no posee muy buen sonido de grabacion, escucho mucho bajo en la percusion, cosa que no he escuchado en otros CDs de musica barroca para adultos. He comprado CD de cuna en ingles, español y portugues, de todos estos este es el unico que no recomiendo."
2,Fast forward review,"Nubility ala DVD. That's cool, although I find it can be easier to take clips from a tape, and it's not like you actually will ""watch"" this thing, right? What we got here is basically a bunch of legal age girls trying to look younger and mostly pulling it off, all filmed in the classic DH haze style.We got a bunch of girls all sleeping in the same room for some reason that maybe the soundtrack reveals, I don't know - brushing their hair, taking showers, dressing, undressing, knitting exciting underwear . . . no wait, that's another movie. But if you were expecting legit lolita sleaze like his books, forget it. Maybe three minutes of clip time. I'll give it one star for each dozen flat-chested shots, so that rounds to about two."
3,acceptable but not great,"these dolls are made by disney rather than the original cute ones made by playmates. these dolls are actually more scary than cute looking. this doll didn't even come with a brush i recommend the playmates ones because they have more accessories. this toy is cute and fun for snuggling up with at night because it is bedtime theme, but the playmates one is also bedtime themed and has a betterlooking doll and more accessories. althought now you can get these disney ones for a value at only ten dollars at any disneystore"
1,what's all this noise about?,"This doc is nothing special, just a bunch of homeless living in the tunnels. Nothing new. In addition, the ending is so boring and predictable - it looks like a public service announcement. At what point we became so fascinated with other people unhappiness? First we make a show out of it, compare these people with rats, then we enjoy seeing somebody living worse than we do, and feel sorry for them. I give one star just because it was shot in focus, and the director really tried to be creative."
2,Not for older children,"I bought this book and the Multiplication facts book for my 11 year old son after seeing all the glowing reviews. He struggles with math facts and I hoped it would help. After we read the first section, it was clear that these books are geared for very young children who are just starting. I guess it depends also what type of learner your child is. I personally thought the stories were difficult to remember and didn't do anything to promote actual learning of the facts. I ended up returning both."
3,Helpful for some kids,"I am the mother of a child with autism and I bought this book to help him memorize his facts. We had some success with this book. My son is very good at remembering stories, but he really was not as interested in this book as I was hoping. This is not the book's fault obviously, my son has a short attention span and it takes a while for us to get through things like this. I thought that the content was fun to look at and I appreciated how it tried to help parents with their children's math struggles. We may try again soon and see if we have more success in the future."
1,Not for Everyone,"I have a 7 year old who still counts on her fingers to add and a 5 year old who has amazing math abilities well beyond addition. They both thought this book was funny, but neither one learned a thing from it. The reviews I read when I purchased it a year ago made it sound as if the method works wonders, so it must do the trick for some. I wish I hadn't wasted the money."
5,Gag gift for Elvis Lover,"My mother in law is a HUGE Elvis fan and I give her gag gifts yearly, this was the gift for this year and she LOVES it!"
4,Surviving the Africa test,I've lived in Africa for over 8 yrs now. This FM transmitter has taken 2 yrs of punishment on 4x4 trips and intl travel. The little switch has broken off but it still works. Clear as a bell. I am buying another one. I often do safari in some of the most dusty conditions...and it still works.For an idea of the conditions it has survived: http://christopherreichert.blogspot.com
2,Four thousand questions and answers on the Ninle,"This book is not what I expected. It is a small book with very small print. The questions are random and not the things that I would have liked to have asked,nor are the answers what I expected."
2,Extremly Disappointed -- Not Orange,"I am disappointed with Amazon. I chose to pay extra for a Fram filter, because of the brand name, and the fact that I love the bright orange color. When I saw the box, I was first surprised at how large it was, but I enjoyed seeing the bright orange box, and the orange filter in the pictures on the box itself. I opened the box and I saw the dullest grey filter I have ever seen, and on it was a small Fram logo, that appeared to be stamped on. The logo was only about 1/4"", and the filter is about 1' high, and 1' across."
1,not a classic or a work of genius,"I bought this book because I heard what a wonderful read it was.It ended up being the first and only book I ever hated. More than 20 years have gone by and it is still the worst book imaginable. Boring, unintelligible, illiterate."
1,UGGH - TERRIBLE!,The worst CD quality I've ever heard. I paid 14:00 + for this crud and Amazon should pay me back. DO NOT BUY THIS STINKER!
3,Junkhouse - 'Strays' (Sony),"Junkhouse,the Canadian rock&roll sensation just MAY have been a bit over-hyped.Don't get me wrong,'Strays' is a decent offering.Junkhouse plays sort of a bluesy-metal like sound.Sort of actually dug tracks like ""Jesus Sings The Blues"",""The Sky Is Falling"",""Stone Horses"" and ""No Way Out Of Love"".The guitar work is good and so is the overall performance.Line-up:Tom Wilson-guitar&vocals,Dan Achen-guitar,Russ Wilson-bass&vocals and Ray Farrugia-drums.See what you think."
3,Beautiful but limited,"The book is absolutely beautiful, but its content for many islands is woefully brief. Since it leaves out the mainland, I would have hoped for more space on the Saronic Islands, for example. Thank heavens they included a brief section on Athens, since everyone has to pass through there sooner or later. But there is almost nothing on the rest of mainland Greece, which is another book. I wish the publisher would put them into one volume. Apparently this is the long awaited new edition."
4,Not only informative but a beautiful book.,"I picked this out of the Amazon lineup, before a short trip to Rhodes, and it is perfect. The illustrations are great - a joy to look at and yet they keep you pointed in the direction of what you might care to see. I envy the authors who obviously got to poke around in the islands and will look for others in the series."
5,Completely satisfied,"The book came quickly in the mail. Just loved the book, it has lots of wonderful pictures. It's very informative, has good tips for hotels and hostels. It breaks down the islands so it makes it easier to figure out how to get from one island to another within the same group. Being a vegetarian, I also enjoyed how they talk about the food it will make it easier for me to eat out."
4,the floor scrubbing was worth it,"I bought this the first time last month. I had too much hair for the two little cans to handle, but I liked what I saw.The colour was so vibrant and went well with my intended costume. I logged that in order to cover my full head I'd have to but three cans instead of two.Problem was, I was spitting pink and after being outside (it's cold) my nose also ran pink. I'm definitely acquiring a dust mask.When I got home, I spent a good hour cleaning my small bathroom. Everything was pink- some things still are pink (from oversight, not staining).But the colour washed right out on the first wash like it's supposed to. I ordered more, and I'm doing the costume again for a party, this time with shorter and thinner(layered) hair. I'll offer some pictures, maybe, if I get any."
5,Excellent!!!,"Wow its the first time I didn't have any coasters, lol. I finally got to use all 25 of them. Would recommend and buy these again for sure."
3,Only worthwhile if you're single and moving to San Fran,"This book has a lot of info about the San Fran area, not as much about the Silicon Valley areas around it and it is not meant for anybody with a family that wants to relocate there -- more of a single person who is moving out there for first time. Gives a brief history of info of the counties around San Fran esp the East Bay, like Santa Clara County but not much of the others and may be slowly outdated by now."
1,Avoid,"i actually gave this zero stars, but amazon for some reason (?) wouldn't let me. i bought this CD in the hopes of purchasing a quality piece of history. what i received was a CD in which the tracks on the CD did not match the tracks on the tracklist. it's a total rip-off."
4,...from the dancaholic at www.seema.net,Awesome video that captures what it's like growing up in Gotham and going out dancing with all your friends on a Friday night! Truly fun stuff!
5,A Truly Masterful Creation,"I was thoroughly impressed by the standard of the book, clearly Mr.Menon has researced the subject in considerable depth,and goes on to portray the life of Sri Krishna in a lucid and vivid manner. I am a man who has spent half my lifetime in reading hindu texts and the presentation of the work, is remarkable in its accuracy and masterful storytelling... And for the modern reader with no past knowledge of Sri Krishna, this book provides an excellent narrative..."
2,Title and subject don't match.,"This is a book on VaR masquerading as a book on Risk Budgeting. I would guess that the publisher changed the name of the book.There are about fourty pages of three hundred that actually deal with risk budgeting: the first 153 pages are an outline of VaR. Its a fair introduction to VaR, but the title is misleading."
5,Great little board!,"Please disregard the previous poster, she obviously did not follow instructions for oiling daily for 1 week before use.The oiling is very important if you want it to last."
4,Hamm atlas italy,"bought both the hammond & michelin atlas used only the hammond lots of cities i was looking for was right at border on michelin.... corinkidink?gps saved me many, many times."
2,A good idea... poorly executed. Cookie cutter nonsense!,"I liked the idea of making Nancy a young outsider with retro tendencies. But, apart from the cool car, retro clothes, and overall ""idea"", I didn't much care for the actual film.The characters are limp, most of the jokes are not very funny, and the overall mystery isn't presented in a way that makes it very interesting. I've seen TV movies that were more entertaining than this.If you're a fan of the Nancy Drew novels, or even the 70's TV series, I doubt you'll have a kind word for this film. I would hope that younger viewers would also be able to see beyond the lackluster ""formula"" being sold directly to them. It's all just cookie cutter nonsense.JM"
5,Nancy Drew,"I went with a friend to watch the Nancy Drew movie when it was in theatres. If it had been in theatres longer I would gone numerous times! All of my freinds (ages 5-100) wanted to go see it, but it didn't stay in theatres long enough! THIS IS A WONDERFUL, ACTION-FILLED MOVIE!!!!!!!!!! I would definetly sujest buying it!"
4,Emma Roberts compared to:,"I seen the movie, it's really good. Emma Roberts did a good job in this movie. This movie is compared to Veronica Mars and Scooby Doo. Nancy Drew is like Velma Dinkley and Veronica Mars all at once. Emma Roberts has the greatest resemblance of Avril Lavigne and 90210 Shenae Grimes."
4,Nancy Drew,Such a cute job. We liked it. They could have really did a terrible job but instead opted for a great kids movie. I can recommend to the whole family.Nancy has to learn to stay away from mysteries but they seem to follow her EVERYWHERE.
4,The pop ups are fun!,"This is not the ""typical"" version of the movie -- which was fine with me. I had fun with the pop-up tidbits and trivia, but definitely you need to make sure it's what you want. If you're not sure, go with the original Drew's Clues."
3,Wish I'd just rented this one,"I liked the premise of this film and it had some beautiful shots. That said, after reading praising comparisons to ""Eraserhead"", it was a let down. For me at least, most surrealism seems to ultimately deal with the artist's psycho-sexual sub-conscience through extremely ambiguous symbolism at best. This film did have its moments, but overall, it came across as more of an ambitious film school project on a budget. Maybe it would have been more fun to watch with some sarcastic friends and a case of beer, but I found myself getting up to get a snack, use the bathroom and check email without bothering to hit the ""pause"" button, even the second time I watched it."
3,"Same ones as on Jetblue, or factory rejects?","I love Terra Blue chips. I was happy to find that they're offered through Amazon, however these are not the quality as those served on Jet Blue. The ones I was delivered through Amazon are a very dark purple, almost black. They also have a definite burnt after taste to them. I was going to put these in the kid's stockings for Christmas morning treats, but since my kids have flown JB with me, they know what these are supposed to taste and look like. These were a disappointment, although I did put them out for a party and they were eventually eaten (teenage boys will eat anything ;)I have to wonder if the only reason we can find these on amazon is because they're the factory rejects they won't send onto JB. I *may* consider ordering a second batch with finger crossed that my first experience was just a fluke... if I do I'll be sure to update here."
5,Great chips!,I loved these potato chips. The chips arrived right away and well-packed! I will definitely order again when I run out of them.
5,THE History of Japanese Literature,"Perhaps, the most inclusive work on the history of premodern Japanese literature, Konishi's three-volume masterpiece is highly valued even today - more than 20 years after its publication.The 3rd volume is somewhat a rarity now, but this shouldn't stop you from trying to acquire what's available.A must-read for any serious student of Japanese literature."
2,Not what I needed,"I ordered this believing it was the whole Oxygen Sensor,but it's just the connector. $30 for it, is about the same price as a lot of complete Sensors. An outrageous price for just a connector. I'm a professional mechanic, & in all my many years, I've never needed just a connector, & at that price, why would you not get the whole unit,& save the hassle of swapping the wires out. Oxygen Sensor should be replaced as a maintenance item every 2-4 years depending on how many miles you drive, for better performance,& cleaner emissions. Yukon Garry"
2,good toy,"I bought this as a gift for my niece's birthday. Her birthday isn't for a couple of weeks so I don't know how durable it is or any of the other information, but I will say that she asked me for a blue horse for her birthday and this is the only one that I found!"
5,jivin' w/ Jaivin,"This was 1 of my favourite reads, along w/ Eat Me & currently I am reading her new book Miles Walker, You're Dead. RNRBFOS is an amusing tale set in Newtown, which in case you didn't know is the sort of alternative centre of Sydney being overtaken by trendy yuppies. 3 feamle aliens take over & bring Jake into their Sexual Experimentation Chamber [there is an accompanying cd w/ songs like this that came out a short while after the book]. Their favourite shows are X-Files & Red Dwarf for obvious reasons. The cover shown here is differenty from the original local edition. It is a witty & occasionally sexually charged book & highly entertaining. I recently had an interview w/ Linda for my fanzine, it was so long it is being split over 2 issues."
1,This book was dreadful - a major let down,"After reading her very funny first book ""Eat Me"" I was expecting much more from Linda than this rubbish. Some friends and I hold a book club to read and review books together. Only 50% of the club manged to even finish it, with the others giving up before the end. And everyone hated it. It's the kind of book I'd expect from some love lorne pubescent teenager. The book is full of very crude sexual jokes and course language which can sometimes be very funny. However in this case the jokes just don't work. It was a major disapointment. BTW -our favourite books so far have been : Glade Within the Grove by Foster David Underground Man by Mick Jackson"
3,Fun for Imaginative Play,"Bought for my 4 1/2 yr old grandson along with ""BumbleBee"" costume so that when he is BumbleBee, his friend can be Optimus Prime. The plastic mask that comes with costume is not great but what you would expect for the cost of the costume. I had also purchased the the Optimus Prime and BumbleBee Voice Changer Helmet so I didn't care about the mask. I felt costume was priced right and quality was relative. My grandson loved it!"
4,fixie !,"the pump overall is perfect for assisting during breaks. however, the stepping portion on the pump needs to be a bit longer so that you can actually step on it. otherwise, this pump has no problem and an great pump."
4,Tight fit,I purchased this pump for my wife's bike. With a smaller frame we needed a short pump to fit on the cross bar and she likes the pleasure gauge. The foot clip helps steady the pump to get up to the 110 psi needed for her tires. If buying for a larger frame I would get the full size model. (Less strokes to fill the tire)
4,Easier than most,Unfolds into a small floor-type pump. Filling a tire is made easier because the pump is more stable & less apt to bend the tire valve. Cannot get more than ~80 pounds of air into a road bike tire which will probably be enough to get you home. Definately easier than most mini pumps. Fits into a medium sized bike bag - big plus!
4,NFL Tire Cover,"One size fits all. Not snug-tight like tailor made, but looks pretty good!makes it easier to find my car, too! Go Colts!!!!!"
3,Dangerous for cribs.,"This looks like a wonderful product, and it is. But a very important warning to parents: you should not ever use an item like this in a baby's crib. Having such a soft surface under your baby increases the risk of SIDS by a surprising amount.Bottom line? A beautiful product. Just not for babies."
3,very tight,keeps you very warm--to sweating.. But make sure you buy a size larger than you are b/c it's very tight.
5,Memorial Stadium Replica,"As someone who lived behind Memorial Stadium for 22 years, I know Memorial Stadium by heart. The replica is great, but I have to say that the fence I used to occassionally watch a game through in the back of the stadium is missing. Also, Section 34 wasn't marked and there was definitely no Wild Bill Haggy, an important missing detail. A nice touch would have been the word ""Orioles"" on the dugout. Omitting my excessive nitpicks, it is a great replica!"
3,"Endearing, but not amazing.",This is just the kind of show that is really adorable when it's in front of you but on a CD lacks class and finesse.
2,What you see is not what you get.,"The strainer part is much smaller than what is pictured. It is a small round basket, not rectangular like what is pictured."
4,Exhilarating and Exhausting,"This book provides a easy-to-understand mental model for thinking about organizational growth. However, the concept of growing and managing three ""horizons"" of growth at the same time exhilarates and exhausts. This book could be enhanced by incorporating sustainable principles like the Triple Bottom Line: People, Planet, and Prosperity."
4,Emerging Growth Business Opportunities,"Great read. It tells you how to identify and nurture new growth opportunities, an area where many good companies struggle. But sadly this book may not make a lot of sense to many companies, whose sole focus is making and selling, and not innovation."
5,"Obscure album, but one of his better works.","This is one of Sinatra's more heartfelt, emotionally charged works. I came across this album while shopping through Sinatra music, and was surprised at the artistry that permeates throughout this album. This story-album is very touching, and is one of Sinatra's better pieces of work. Every time I listen to songs on this album I find myself wanting to listen to the entire album through. If you enjoy the later Reprise albums then this is definitely one to have."
2,Just OK,I expected more of a tour of the city. There is a fair amount on Hudsons and Ford and Belle Isle but not much more. Too many interviews pertaining to the music joints from the 20 and 30s and way too much on the Grande Ballroom and Olympia. Not what I expected.
5,ironing board replacement cover,Great replacement cover. I had been trying to find one for some time and was glad to find one at an affordable price. I couldn't be happier.
3,Tight fit,"Let me start by saying this replacement cover is well made and I am happy overall. But... I purchased this for an in-wall ironing board and the measurements were exactly what the cover was advertised to be. It took me about 20-minutes to get the cover on my board and de-wrinkled. It was very tight and I gently stretched it (I was afraid of tearing the seams, but didn't). I eventually got it over the plywood frame, but getting the wrinkles out proved equally challenging. This cover either needs a larger elastic seam or it need to be slightly larger."
5,Ironing board cover,I have had such a hard time finding a cover that would fit my ironing board. I am so pleased to say that this fits perfectly! I am so happy with it that I ordered another one as a back up.
5,Good charger for the money...,"This model takes both AA and AAA NiMH and Ni-Cd batteries. Although it isn't a quick charge model it takes only about five hours for my NiMH's to charge. I didn't need a quick-charge model so speed was a moot point.The K200 is well built and doesn't have any easily-breakable parts, a problem I've had with a few other models. The reverse-polarity protection and peak voltage shutdown are features nice to have included.Also accepts non-Kodak brand batteries, as they are fairly [more] compared to others."
1,Disappointing bio of America's first great leader,"I found this bio to be quite disappointing. It is relatively brief, and many important events in Washington's life and career are only given a few sentences or paragraphs. Most of the author's observations regarding Washington's character are not presented until the end, and then they are disjointed and seem to be mere afterthoughts. The author also tends to group many subjects into a single paragraph, perhaps to hide the lack of detail. Compared to other historical bios (like McCullough's John Adams or Blumenson's Patton) this book is poorly written, difficult to read, and lacking in detail and information. I do not recommend this book at all."
2,Very Disappointed,"I have been wearing this style of Clark's sandal for years. Am generally disappointed in Clark now since they seem to have abandoned most of their classics so was happy to see these offered on Amazon. However, the shoes I received are NOT the Clark's I bought a year ago. These are sized differently and cut differently. Didn't look or feel like the Clark's sandals I purchased last year. Then I noticed these sandals are ""Made in China."" In the past they were made in England. The final irony is that the name is now ""Clark's of England"" whereas before it was just Clark's."
2,Sent one back,The unit worked but it had two problems. The speaker volume at maximum can not be hears without holding it to my ear. When the phone transmitter is turned off the speaker transmitts a loud static and must be turned off immediately.
3,Not bad.,This was a Pretty clean MacBook. It was way slower than I expected because they put the new software on it but the hardware was older and has a hard time keeping up.
1,Terrible!,"I sent this one back!!! First the color is not as shown. The pudding is a ""gray"" color (how appetizing is that!) not the vanilla color as shown. Second the taste is horrible! Not a hint of vanilla, just a medicinal flavor. Yuk! Got it for a family member who has chronic illness thinking it was a good way to keep up nutrients without neglecting taste. I was wrong! Yuk!!!"
5,this is an awesum top in battle,wen hit it does exact same damage back.....its awesum its got great speeed and durability.....its does lots of damage......its a great top if u train it up alot...as a driger fan id recomend this top if ur looking 4 a strong durable blade that does alot of damage in driger blades....
4,A good read,I'm new to the Dorothy Martin mysteries but I did enjoy the book. It's quick reading; you don't have to think; and the characters are believable and lovable. It's a great escape when you want to unwind.
3,"Ow, My Fingers!!","This game is, to say the least, Addictive With A Capital ""A"".It might seem hard when you start playing (I know it was for me; I got stuck at one point in Easy Mode the first time around), but it becomes much much easier over time. However, I've had it for give or take a few years and bits of it still escape me (i.e. how to get Sentret, how to beat the thing in less than 25 seconds, etc. etc.). Oh well, I expect I'll figure those bits out too.One more thing: do NOT play this at night if you can't sleep. I did this once, and for about two days afterwards, whenever I stared at the wall, I saw puzzle designs. True story.And you will probably like this game if you like Tetris."
4,Ive got galactic goo dripping from my cieling,"These guys are so awesome. Everytime I see them I look around the room and count the jaws that resting on the floor. But at the same time I hear these folks (not in the show of course) saying Galactic ""rips off"" New Orleans music. Or they ""are playing nothing that hasnt been played before"". Why cant they just be a band that is playing great music? Ive been to New Orleans, I know who the Meters are. But Galactic is bringing new energetic life to a great genre of American music. Buy this album. Go see the band. Dont cheat yourself of an experience that just cant be paralelled."
4,"Awesome, but lousy packaging","My son got this as a gift for his birthday and he loves that it's every Cars movie especially the Cars Toons! However, just as stated with most other reviews, the packaging is really lousy. I can't even put the dvd's in correctly in that little soft foam holder."
3,So-so,"I bought this pillow to make the transition to sleeping only on my side easier when I became pregnant. It is a wonderful pillow--except the area where your neck goes is very uncomfortable!The seam of the inside curve on both ends is sewn while pulled very tightly, so when I position my head on top, this tight seam digs into my shoulder. I have tried to ease it by pushing it up against the headboard, or making sure the whole pillow wasn't held taut, or draping it with an extra pillowcase, but nothing I do has helped. I wake up with a sore shoulder, which stinks because I love the rest of the pillow! I'm going to see if it's returnable, and I'm going to try the one shaped like a ""6"", and use my own pillow for my head. Oh well!"
4,finally some relief,"It kills me to pay $65 for a pillow, but I admit it's worth it. I'm 5 months pregnant and I was only comfortable on my side, but after a couple hours my hips would start to kill me as if I was sleeping on a hard floor. I tried a pillow between the knees but it didn't help. I tried propping myself up but that didn't help either. I finally ordered this and it has made a huge difference. They really do need to create a cover for this as mine is now covered in cat hair. And I wouldn't recommend it for hot nights as it stays pretty toasty. Should be great for fall/winter though. I'm completely glad I got this and would recommend it to any pregnant person. It doesn't take up that much room in our queen size bed either."
2,Ok...nothing too exciting,"Star Stalkers is about exactly what you think it's about. Some celebrities are stalked by crazed fans. I feel badly for them, but that's the price of fame. Geez, I'm glad I'm just a nobody."
4,Nice and big!,I cook alot so I get quite a bit of use out of the splatter screen. This one is much better than the old fashioned metal/plastic type ones. My only complaint is that these are not dishwasher recommended. I have put this in the dishwasher a few times though and had no problems. (I use Air Dry Heat for my machine).
4,Handy,"As strange as it may sound, I actually purchased this item as a gift for my daughter, per her request. She was concerned about splatters of grease popping out of the skillet when frying bacon and other items. She just places the screen over the skillet...and, no splatters. Very handy when there are young children in and out of kitchen during meal preparation. The merchant's description was good and the item arrived right on schedule. I would purchase from this merchant again given the opportunity and/or need. Same could be said for the item itself also."
1,Complete waste of time,"I had to use this book as a text in a programming course for college. This book is awful. I am an accomplished and educated programmer and I cannot see how anyone could benefit from this book. I spent a great deal of time helping my fellow students, as the book raised many unanswered questions. Avoid this book."
2,"Pretty, but a pain","Aside from the other reviewers' complaints about the lack of recipes or instructions, having used this with a standard sterno can or tea-candle, I can attest that the little incredient cups are a bit too small, and trying to clean the pot (especially after using cheese) is extremely difficult. We quite literally cut our wrists tryint to scrub the interior out. The top opening is sharp with little notches, so you really have to watch out with your sponge and bare wrists. We're not sure if we'll ever use this again- and most certainly would not recommend it unless it's on sale."
3,Still no burner,"I received this lovely gift for Xmas LAST YEAR and have not yet been able to use it due to no instructions or a burner. It would of been very nice to have at least an idea of how to get started. I also have not yet been able to find a burner-the main reason why I have not yet used it-everytime I visit Target-which is at least 3x a month- I search and search, find nothing and nobody there seems to know or care what I am looking for...very frustrating. Other then that it is a beautiful set and my husband is patiently waiting for me to use it"
2,one hit wonder,"I bought this CD because I really like that song ""All My Life"", but when I got it home and listened to it I found out it was the only song I enjoyed listening to on the whole CD. The music was monotonous and the message was ordinary."
4,classic trower.,"I bought this ALBUM when it first came out.Later that year,(1981)B.L.T. made a surprise drop at the Royal Oak Music theater and played front to back of this album and blew away a very stunned Detroit crowd away. 'nuff said."
3,Good product but don't order liquids from amazon.,"Two shipments were required to get some of this product to me in the bottle. The first shipment had completely leaked out into the envelope. Amazon required that I ship the soggy envelope back to them for credit! The second shipment had only leaked about 20% into the plastic bag it had been placed in, inside a box. Perhaps Amazon could invest in some tape to secure the lids on liquid products. Fortunately I could enjoy the minty fresh sent while cleaning up the mess."
4,Almost an MRI thanks to Amazon,"I purchased the Bounty Hunter metal detector for my 10 year-old grandson. We were astonished when the detector picked up the bb-shot that has been lodged in my left shin bone for 63 years. I didn't know it was there myself until a few years ago when I had an MRI prior to knee surgery. This convinced my grandson that he could actually discover things with the device and he's looking forward to ""treasure hunting"" in various areas around town."
4,Bounty Hunter Gold Digger Metal Detector,"So far we have only opened it one day. My son loves it.It finds everything even pull tabs and roofing nails in the yard unless you have the trash eliminator on high. He found a metal nugget under near oak tree. Most likely is iron but we will have it anlayzed.So far, so good."
1,Broken 2nd time out,"I bought this for a 9 year old, and was happy with the size, the functions, the weight and the price it until we used it. The second time out, it stopped working properly."
1,Didn't work out of the box!,"I purchased this for my 9 year old son and spent the night trying to figure out why it didn't work, come to find that the wiring was damaged. Received a refund and no issue with the return, I didn't like the quality of the product so I just wanted my money back."
2,Saga,"This DVD is good for Roy Roger fans... However, the DORIS DAY in this movie is NOT the Doris Day who played in Pillow Talk. Putting this DVD in Her movie sections was misleading. It is NOT Doris Day the ICON-- the world's best singer, dancer, comedic and dramatic actress...."
4,Enjoyed this one a lot,"My 10 yo daughter and I have been enjoying Double Dutch. I understand why some reviewers believe it is unlikely that Delia would be so successful in covering up the fact that she can't read. I have, however, seen learning disabilities go unnoticed by parents and teachers in children who are otherwise bright and well behaved. (I've also seen tremendous efforts made to put gifted but poorly behaved children in special ed programs so that knife swings both ways :-)Another thing I liked about Double Dutch was that by and large it offers a positive and affirming picture of the lives of urban, African American middle schoolers. They face real challenges but there are many caring, involved adults--parents, teachers, coaches--who are really pulling for them in the end."
4,Double Dutch,"Sharon Draper has done another great job in authoring this book. I am so glad to see this book a perfect match for middle schoolers. It is not too old for 6th graders or too young for 8th graders. I don't have to worry about language or inappropriate scenes, either...what a relief! It does deal with an older student being a non-reader plus the tensions of dealing with a natural disaster and even throws in dealing with divorce. That is done in an extremely healthy way. I would recommend this as a class novel, small groups, or individual students (or adults!)."
4,A Classic,"Together with the Falcon series from Spectrum Holobyte (or Graphsim, now), this is a classic simulation. It had everything - wingman interaction, full-immersion campaign, detailed avionics systems, beautiful graphics, excellent flight model, and awesome carrier ops. I'm in the process of setting up an old laptop to play the pre-Windows 95 PC games - I can't wait to get back to this one. The campaign missions suffered from some strange bugs, such as a portion of a strike package turning around and heading home half way into a flight, but this is only a minor detraction. The Gold version fixed a lot of this, in addition to adding a ton of features."
3,"OK, not great","This is definitely a classroom book. That said, it will be somewhat useful homeschooling my two oldest (pre-K, and K next year). The science is very basic, moreso than I would have liked. It does provide a nice starting place, though, which is often what I need. The activity ideas are fun, and I can always add to the information and complexity.All in all, I am certainly glad that I bought this book used and very inexpensively (total with shipping was around $4.50). I think I will get my money's worth, but not if I had bought it new..."
4,Financial Management : Principles and Applications (10th Edition),The Book was not plastic covered and plus there was no cd included in the book
1,One of the Worst,"One of the worst books I've read. It's not so much a memoir as it is a collection of disjointed ramblings. Topics include the author's early years in religious life, her poetry, and her dabblings into alternative faiths & philosophy."
2,Odd color blemished door wouldn't buy again,"The cabinet is more ""Cherry"" looking to me but others have told me that it is mahogany, this looks odd to me. The big problem was the quarter sized mark in the finish on the front door! Looks bad I wouldn't buy the cabinet for this money again."
4,"A Bygone Era, Remembered","I love trains, and I was born just a little too late to have enjoyed the last great decade of train travel (I was 15 when Amtrak was formed).So it's great to live that era vicariously through books like this. The presentation of the posters is top-notch, as are the bios of the artists and the descriptions of the processes by which certain posters were created. Not a complete documentation, but a vital part of any railroad library."
4,This Book Stimulated My Interest in Railroad Art,Length:: 0:11 MinsSo I went out and bought my first print from NelsonArtWorks.net? So waddaya think?
4,Really good,"Gilda is just amazing. Some people compare her to Harriet the Spy. In my opinion, Harriet is a rich brat, so Gilda's cooler. BEWARE!!!! This book gave my MOM nightmares, so don't read it if you're easily scared. Me, I loved it, but I guess it depends what kind of person you are.Just like the first book, there were a few things that could have been left out, like the entire character Tiara. But, of course, psychic investigators need to have wild goose chases sometimes, so it almost made it more realistic."
5,Quirky and lovable!,"Gilda may not be very good at staying out of trouble, but with her quirky and lovable personality she is an expert at getting into the readers' hearts.I thoroughy enjoyed the first Gilda Joyce book, so I was pleased to have the opportunity to read another one. I wasn't disappointed.Jennifer Allison has successfully built a story with the perfect amount of complexity. It has just enough surprises to keep you guessing, but not enough to cause frustration.Loved it!"
5,Rhino does another spectacular job...,"Rhino does another spectacular job. In this case, they covered a career from 1954 when he changed his name to King and named his guitar Lucy to 1992 when Albert died from a heart attack. Rhino compiled all his best songs (39 of them including such classics as Laundromat Blues and Born Under A Bad Sign) from many labels and left out the crap such as his over-produced mid-70's period and Elvis tribute albums. There is a 50 page booklet that tells the whole story with lots of interviews with band mates and club owners. I found it interesting that he was left-handed and played a right-handed guitar upside down and backward with no pick. After listening to this collection, I can safely say that King had more influence on Eric Clapton and Stevie Ray Vaughn than any other guitarist."
1,I love George but this cd is really bad,"I love George Strait, but both of Garth Brooks Christmas cds blow this one out of the water. I make this point because I am the first to give Strait the credit as the best Country artist of the the 80's and 90's and not Brooks. This cd drags and drags again. It sounds like it was thrown together really quick to meet the season. George sings with no emotion, which is rare, and if I did not no better I would think that he was Jewish. I hate to say it, butI play allot of Christmas music during the holidays and I no longer even consider this disc. I only keep it for collection reasons."
4,A GS Fan,"If you like George Strait, you will like this CD. As a previous reviewer mentioned, a few of the songs are bit slow and sound kind of wooden. Luckily its only a few songs and the rest have that Texas Swing sound that George is known for. ""Merry Christmas Strait to You"" is the best song on the CD."
5,Will prove a kitchen shelf favorite,"The Hot Sauce Bottle Cookbook is a slender, 62-page booklet surveying and showcasing the top brands of hot sauces and offers recipes that are spicy and delicious. From Caribbean Pumpkin Soup, Creole Rice, and Curried Snapper with Mango Chutney, to Baked Brie with Roasted Garlic, Peachberry Salsa, and Firecracker Shrimp, this little collection will prove a kitchen shelf favorite for the adventurous family chef. Of special value are the hot sauce cooking tips on everything from ""Measuring the Heat"" to ""Chile Versus Chili""."
5,The Lee Girls,"The book was a wonderful view into the life of Robert E. Lee's family as well as perfect picture of what the social, educational and family scene was in the mid 1800's. The dairies of family members allow us to picture their journey through life with intimate detail. The book points out the closeness of family, as well as the lost art of letter writing, as our society has progressed from pen and paper to e:mail and instant messages."
3,Ho hum.,There was nothing special about this book. The author's first few books were much better. I agree with another reader who says this is not a keeper.
5,Great tool for seniors who fear computers,"Chris Willoughby has written a gem of an instruction guide. I was able to take his instruction and apply it to motivate my parents in using the computer. It really does work. It was an easy read and I highly recommend it to break the ice for seniors who are intimdated by computers. The only problem now is, my folks are always on the computer!"
1,Junk,"2nd one I have bought, both have done the same thing. Each one shuts off and turns back on every couple of minutes. Just not reliable. Wouldn't recommend it to anyone. If you plan to wake up on time this item isn't for you."
1,Cheap Product!,"This clock does have a nice display and great alarm features. However, within the first two months it started to randomly reset when the wave feature was used. Eventually, I turned the wave off, but that caused the display to go black again and again. This clock would have been perfect for me if it weren't for all these malfunctions. I thought mine might be a defect, but it seems that some people are having similar issues. I won't buy any Emerson products in the future."
5,Has everything I was looking for,"I've been through a lot of alarm clocks, but I never found one that had everything I wanted. Until now.+ Crescendo alarm: Alarm buzzer starts out soft, but gradually gets louder and louder until you wake up+ IR Snooze: Simply wave at the clock to catch another 10 minutes of sleep. It ignores your movements for the first few beeps, so you can't accidentally oversleep by moving around unintentionally.+ Sets itself! True, this doesn't set itself to the atomic clock, but the battery backup keeps you on time during power outages (the alarm still sounds even when on battery backup).+ Monday thru Friday alarms: I always forgot to set my alarm Sunday evenings, and forgot to turn it off Friday evenings. Now, I don't have to worry being late Monday or waking up too early on Saturday.+ Dual Alarms: Have one setting for Monday-Friday, and another one for the weekend! You can look at the clock and at-a-glance see which alarms are set to go off and for what time."
1,"Don't do it, buy something else","The time and alarms would reset to midnight randomly and often. After a few days of no morning alarms this 'alarm' clock was just used as a clock and the old alarm clock for the actual alarms. If you are old, have poor eyesight, and you don't need to get up at the time you set your alarm for, this clock is the one for you.It quit working completely after only a few months use."
1,Horrible Clock & Radio!,"Upon arrival, I plugged it in and it automatically set to the correct time. After awhile, the number became blur and there were no numbers, just a bunch of lines that make no sense. If I had the radio on, it would not turn off because of the glitch. The time & date were unreadable. If you are going to buy this, you might want to keep an eye on it and see if it glitches on you too.Terrible quality check on the product."
4,Good clock radio with middling instructions,"My initial shipment was faulty, but Amazon immediately replaced it and facilitated returning it. The replacement works well. I like the large, bright numerals, easily seen in the dark. The radio is easy to tune and has a nice sound quality. The automated time setting is a nice feature that is to be expected in up to date clocks. The controls are easy to use once you learn them, but the instructions seemed a bit obtuse to me, and it took a while to get everything working satisfactorily.I would recommend the clock radio to a friend with the sole reservation give above."
2,backup battery dead on arrival,"would not work when plugged in.Backup battery was dead, returned, received new clock,same problem,tired of b.s., purchased new battery for 4.29. Problem solved.need battery to activate settings!!"
4,Ricks review on the Emerson Radio w/ SmartSet Technology,This is a cool clock radio. The numbers are large. The radio sound is clear. The alarm works perfectly. I would reccommed it for anyone who needs to get up at a certain time each workday--just set it and forget it.
2,Emerson Radio Mediocre,"The Emerson clock radio has a great clock because but the radio stations blur together, even for stations with a strong broadcast. This makes the radio useless. I am going to have to buy a new clock radio because of this."
2,Emerson Radio,Was really hoping for a lot better reception on AM. Not very good. Thought I was purchasing a digital radio also and it isn't.
2,Great Alarm but Short Life,"I bought this Alarm to replace an Atomic dual alarm clock that was too hard to use. I loved this alarm clock. The set up was so easy. I just plugged it in and was ready to go. I love that you could see the time for the alarm settings. However in July the alarm just went to the wrong time in the middle of the night. We woke up late the next morning. I tried to reset the clock manually and the buttons on the top stopped working. I tried unplugging the clock, but when I would plug it back in the time would come on incorrect again. I called Emerson and of course the warrenty is only 6 months so they could do nothing for me. They suggested I remove the battery and then insert it again and plug it in. That did not help, so now it is in the trash. As good as the clock is the short life time and unreliability make it a bad choice."
5,Uncomplicated,"I finally found this easy-to-use alarm clock. We threw away the one with 20 buttons that wakes you slowly to any number of soothing sounds, the smell of coffee brewing, and the growing light of dawn -- It was too complicated to use! Nice idea... but in practice, you just want something that works. This one does the trick."
1,"be very, very careful--no season mode","this game was really cool until i started looking through the game options. for an ea sports game not to have a season or dynasty mode is just beyond me. you can only have fun with this game if you're playing against other people.there is a cheesy little tournament mode, but that takes all of five minutes to finish. i don't understand how you can wait so long to release a game like this and not have any appealing features on it. it's not like other ea sports games don't have these kind of gameplay modes and stat-tracking capabilities already (i.e. NCAA 2002, a college football game that implements full season and dynasty modes with recruiting options as well, now that's what i expect from an ea sports product)this game just did not deliver. i would be careful in buying it."
3,Look at the title of this game!!!,"The reason there is no season mode, is because of the title: MARCH MADNESS 2002, which means this is a tournament game!!!! That is why there is only a tournament mode! If you want to play a seson with out all the march MADNESS, buy NCAA Basketball 2k3!!!"
1,EA Sports gets less than an F on both their basketball games,I usually go to their website to read the message boards and they deleted the Playstation 2 Message board with some customers comments regarding how to recover their loses by returning the game to EA sports for a full refund. I guess they want to suck poor kids hard earned money for a half- ... job.
2,what happened EA?!,"This game had one big missing link a season mode. the commanentry is boaring and it's not a real chalenge, so far there not a reel good NCAA b-ball game. also when i played with uva it was not even close to what U-hall looked like. wait for sega's college hoops 2k2."
2,EA Sports makes a BOO-BOO,"In their rush to release this game for PS2 they forgot some VERY IMPORTANT pieces to this game.1. The team list is missing a large group of teams. I think somewhere around 150 teams.2. No season mode. This is the most glaring mistake. How can you have a basketball game like this and NOT have a season mode??3. No dynasty mode. Once again, BIG mistake leaving this out.The gameplay is fun, but without the above items, this game only goes so far. And that isn't nearly far enough.Don't get this game."
5,Awesome!!!!!!!!!,"I wish i could give this book more than 5 stars. It is hard for a book to keep my attention all the way through, but this one did. The main characters of the book lenox and farah keep you looking for what they are going to do next, and their passion and attraction for eachother pulls you in, also the drama that comes along with them trying to keep the relationship afloat. I can't wait for the next novel. Good job!!!!"
5,dice,Nice time spender with the family who loves to bowl but can't always get to lanes . Helps keep with a bowling theme family
4,Almost there,"Not quite as 'deadening' as I thought it would be, but still got the job done. Adjustable and portable enough to save me $$ from renting at the gun range."
2,Okay not great.,I found these to be way too small for my head. They are not adjustable. The headband pictured here is not what comes on the muffs. The one that actually comes on them is a hard piece of plastic with no padding at all making them extremely uncomfortable to wear. I returned them the same day they arrived.
3,Disappointed,"I wore these at the range for the first time yesterday and was disappointed in their noise protection. I found some of the weapons being fired by other shooters too loud, and my right ear rang slightly for an hour after I left even though I was only firing a 9mm. On the plus side, I often find headphones uncomfortable if they touch my ears at all, and these were very comfortable. They are also priced well."
4,have trouble Sleeping? Try these Protectors.,"Though not generally used to block out annoying sounds while trying to sleep, these really work. You do have to forget they are on your ears and remain on your back during sleep, YOU DO SLEEP!"
5,Works as advertised,"Needed these for the shooting range. After some research, I found shooting specific hearing protectors were 2-3 times more expensive. These are the same (same manufacturer & specs) as many high-rated shooting ear protectors. For a passive set, they worked great - really blocked out my 9mm & .38 Special. I could barely hear the guy next to me with a .45 and AR-15. Probably buy another set for my wife."
5,Best Praise and Worship from the 80's,"I can hardly believe that they've re-released this album! I am so excited. I used to collect all of Integrity's Praise & Worship albums from the 80's and 90's. This is one of my favorite, not a bad song on the whole album. I used to take my daily walks with this one in my Sony Walkman and oh how I just loved to listen to it. If you enjoy praise and worship, you will love this recording. Can't wait to see the other ones that are available again. Thanks so much for making them available again and on CD."
1,Poor quality all around,"Sure the packaging is pretty and they come with little cards to set up next to them explaining their purpose, but all in all these cameras are crap. Many of them had issues with the film moving all the way forward and as a result you end up with two halves of different pictures in one frame. The flash function failed a majority of the time and the quality of the pictures were horrible. Would not recommend. Some of the best pictures I got were emailed or posted on photo sharing sites and came from others digital cameras. Save yourself some money and avoid these."
1,Terrible Streaks,This stuff leaves terrible streaks on my floors. I have wilsonart red label laminate flooring and this stuff is horrible. The only ones besides the official wilsonart laminate cleaner that works is the hard floor cleaner by bissel.
4,Tristan at Ashley River El.,I like Alaska's Three Bears because I learned a lot of stuff in the book. I had no idea only three bears lived in Alaska. If I could be one of the bears I would be the Small black bear just lying in a tree in the jungle. That sounds like my kind of life.
4,"Strong Box, Ordinary Board","This game is marketed as a very durable version of chutes and ladders. The box is strong, but the rest of the game is the same as what comes in the card board box version."
2,Never received game,I have purchased many things online and this is the first order that I have never received. I don't know what happened but the game never arrived.
5,Classic Christmas Music,"This album, along with The Sounds Of Christmas by Fred Waring, Andy Williams, and the other albums from the 60s and 70s, are the quintessential Christmas Music. When A Very Special Christmas and many of the modern Christmas CDs are collecting dust, these will still be played due to their timelessness and quality.Not trying to be a hitmaking CD or getting radio airplay, these songs are meant to be enjoyed at night with cookies being baked or the tree being decorated.I just hope my love of those CDs rubs off on my children and they enjoy listening to it as much as I."
5,My favorite Christmas CD,"Hands down, this is my favorite Christmas CD. As a kid, my Mom had the record and we played it every year. It's fun, upbeat and great for the entire family to enjoy. Christmas wouldn't be the same without it."
5,The Best!,Love this CD. Brings back so many memories. If you buy only one of Ray's CD's this is the one to buy.
5,BO,"EXACTLY THE OVER-VIEW OF THE SERIES, CHARACTERS, ACTORS , AND ""BEHIND-THE-SCENES"" STORIES THAT I WANTED"
2,Worked great right up until it didn't...,"She's dead, captain. We've had this scale for less than 3 years, and it really hasn't seen a lot of use, and it's pretty much dead. Even with new batteries, it completely resets (time and date included) when you set it down. Turn it on, set everything, set it down, all gone. Was nice while it lasted, but pretty pricey for something to die so quickly."
2,Not as funny as the regular episodes,"You get to know Dr. Weird and the Cybernetic Ghost from Christmas Past a little more. They appeal to some people, but my favourite characters are the Mooninites and Carl. I wasn't impressed with Carl's role in the film. I didn't laugh near as much as I do in all of the normal episodes."
3,Funny for fans.,"I am a fan of the 12 mintue antics of ATHF on Cartoon Network's Adult Swim. It's really bizarre, stupid, and pointless but funny and entertaining. The film is all those things, too. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone unless they really like ATHF. The story doesn't make sense, and I don't think the writers really wanted it to. The basic plot involves an exercise machine and the orgins of Frylock, Master Shake, and Meatwad. There are appearances by Dr. Weird, Steve, Ignignokt and Err (the Mooninites), Oglethorpe and Emory (the Plutonians), MC Pee Pants, and Cybernetic Ghost of Christmas Past from the Future. Bruce Campbell, Chris Kattan, and Tina Fey provide cameo voice work. The film's short running time helps. For fans only."
1,"After the intro music video, it's all downhill","If you're a fan of the show, you know it's been running on fumes the last 2 years, the ideas have dried up. At a time when the writers seem to have no ideas, they decide to do a movie and the results show they still have no ideas. The music video at the beginning is the only reason to watch this movie. It's like a few ATHF outtakes patched together, nothing special, it looks as if no real effort was put into it. No plot and what works fine as 10 minute TV episodes blows when stretched out for an 87 minute movie. Save your money, buy the series DVDs, but avoid this turkey."
4,Hilarious movie...poor dvd quality,"Well, I'm sure we have all seen this movie by now. If you love athf, you will love the movie, if not, you will hate it. The Dvd bundle comes with tons of extra features, some of which are really cool. The only thing about watching this dvd (which I have MANNNYYY times) is the audio is kinda bad. There are scenes where the dialogue will be a normal audio level, then the music or sound effects will be wayyyyyyyy louder. You have to watch the wholemovie with your thumb ready on the volume button. But Still, great buy."
2,Does anyone actually watch the DVD before posting a review?,"I bought this DVD as I am an avid ATHF fan. However, the audio sucks. I can understand anything anyone says unless I unbalance the audio on my surround to put the center at the highest point and all other speakers at the lowest. And forget about watching it with only the TV audio. You can't understand a thing. The mix on this DVD is one of the worst ever and I would not recommend buying it.... It appears everyone puts a review into this site even before the item is available for sale. This is worthless if you haven't even watched or listed to the product. Everyone who posted a review so far is an idiot."
2,no way 5 stars,i still don't get why they didn't use the clips shown as outakes in volume 5 in the actual movie. they were 10 times more hilarious. same with why they stuck to the same story line throughout the whole film. that's not the aqua teen hunger force way. i rate volumes 1 to 6 as all 5 stars but this film was weak. the bit at the start with the animated heavy rock band was especially wince inducing - basically saying behave in the cinema!!! sheesh. i'd been trying to get a friend of mine into aqua teens for a while and unfortunately this was the first thing i got them to watch - after 15 mins i was starting to feel very embarrased about all the claims i had made for the show. poor show.
2,Horribly authored,"The content might be enjoyable on its own, but the way the DVD was put together makes watching any of it very difficult. The menus are atrocious, and while they may be funny the first time you sit through their ridiculously lengthy transitions, that novelty quickly wears off. What's worse, on my DVD player (Denon) I cannot select ""Play Movie"" after changing the audio options (which is necessary if you want to actually understand any of the dialogue thanks to the way it's been buried in the mix) so I had to eject the thing and start over. Kudos to the boys for burying us in extras, but I have a hard time believing that anybody in QA actually watched this disc before sending it off for production. I can only hope they recall these discs as quickly as those stupid LED stick-ups."
5,ATHF:MFFT for DVD is a GREAT MOVIE,"If you enjoy the ATHF television show, then this movie is right for you. You'll love it. If you don't like the show, then why are you even looking at the movie? Seriously. If you like the show, you'll like this movie. If not, you won't."
4,hilarious,if you like twisted shows and aren't too concerned with awesome lifelike animation this is totally the movie for you..
2,Decent enough,"A fairly basic introduction to Java 3D. Its not really a technical book - and the authors and publishers are honest enough about that. It's utility in terms of customizable applets is dubious. The Java 3D tutorial is a better place to start if you already know 3D programming. Real sloppy work on the part of Wiley. No Java 3D SDK on the CD-ROM. The URL on the back of the book is to another book's website...Well, its not like there are a bunch of books on Java 3D to choose from anyway, so if you must have a book this is it."
4,Geat help,"This book is a great help to those who want to run java 3D in Web browser. It comes with many valuble samples and help me solve many problems on Java3D installation. Although many pages are program code, in general, it's a solid book."
3,On The Tight Rope,"I am undecided as to how useful this book was. I managed to pick it up from the college library. Seems any book that has to do with 3D API is scarce besides the specification which I have read. I did like the fact that there was source examples. As a new java programmer, I have spent the last few months drilling my way through this stuff pieceing together what I could from this text and that of the specification. I have to say that this stuff is not for the faint at heart. Programming 3D anything is an achievement in itself. I would have to say that the authors gave it their best shot to get the idea of how the 3D API works, but it took me a while for it to sink in before I was able to see dramatic results. I managed to develop a 3D game from what I picked up and maybe I will write that book everyone is looking for next. Although, I may need a good editor :>)"
2,Noxious plastic fumes,"I returned this product after receiving it as a gift because the intense/noxious fumes coming from the plastic lid are so strong that I would never consider drinking from it. Great design, but made in China, and for the price, should provide safe plastic parts, especially for drinking hot beverages."
2,Pay for what you get,The case works but its cheaply made and comes with no (very little) instructions or real support for the HD. Mine just kind of sits in the case not really screwed in because the holes at the bottom were drilled all wrong.
5,It's great for the price!,"Based on a lot of the other reviews, I was afraid to buy this. But, since a trusted friend did recommend it, I went ahead and purchased it anyway. It's perfect for me. My HD fits in there great, the cover closes perfectly, yeah, it's a ~little~ flimsy, but no where near as much as I thought it would be based on other reviews. I have had it on for almost 24 hours straight and it hasn't heated up at all (it's made to not overheat). No tools needed - just screw the nobby things back on, and there ya have it. I am very pleased with the purchase (so far, anyway)."
1,Doest Handle Larger Capacity Hard Drives,"It worked fine for an old 20 gig hdd I had laying around but I just tried to transfer some files on a larger drive to no avail the larger drive ,(80 gig sata wooo!!!)will not show up in my computer neither will a 160 gig IDE only my really old 10 to 20 gig hard drives work.Oh take that back not even all old my 10 to 20 gig hdds so this thing is fickle as well and only works with certain types yes I tried the jumper settings on the hdds as well as none.) This crazy thing is also an electrical hazard. If you plug it in and do not notice that the power switch is on it creates a short circuit. My girlfriend lost her whole test when the power surge took place.Please discontinue this before someone catches their house on fire or breaks a window from a nice heavy toss out their window and into oblivion.Im not upset I just see it as a $20.00 big bulky, needing a power supply , 15 gigabyte FLASH DRIVE.Thank You For This Sabrent. Yours Truly , DickSizzle"
4,good basic set,"My kid wants to try charcoal drawing. This set had starter stick, pencil and kneaded eraser. It did not have mixing pencil, which turns out to be a sharpened plastic stick. We went to art supply store for this."
1,Drop Anniversary Edition game for PC,I was so excited to this game. However once I started playing it I hated it. It's nothing like other game like it I've played. This one is boring and doesn't take up full screen of computer. It's a little tiny screen. Don't waste your money on this one.If you really want it I'll send you mine!
1,Horrible purchase!,"I had two different kinds of mad katz bluetooth for the PS3. They both failed to sustain a charge. The first one wouldn't even charge out of the box it was shipped in. The second one worked for 2 days and then failed to charge. This is a horrible product. I would not recommend mad katz products to ANYONE!!!! I now know why you have to pay a little more for the official gear, QUALITY!!!"
1,Trash,This is the worst product I think I've ever bought. Brand new out of an untouched package and its completely broken. The headset doesn't charge or turn on even after following every step correctly from the manual. Don't spend your money on this!!
4,easy to use test and accurate,"I have used this pregnancy test twice, and had accurate results both times. It is more accurate if you wait until you've actually missed your period as the instructions indicate, otherwise if you are pregnant the lines won't be as dark. I was clueless when I went to the drugstore to buy a test, but I had heard a lot of good things about EPT and know they are a reputable well known company so that's why I chose E.P.T."
4,You don't know John Brown,"If you were, like I was, taught that John Brown was not much more than a well-meaning madman then you don't know the John Brown of history. Oates does a great job of dispelling that myth as well as presenting for the first time the full picture, thoroughly footnoted, of the man who may have sparked the Civil War. I have small gripes with some of the text, but none worth mentioning here. Read it and be impressed."
1,Waste of money,This is a cheep product that never worked and needs to be pulled from amazon.com.I put in fresh battires and tried to clean a DVD what a joke just made a noise. It was suposed to come with cleaning fluid and did not.Better off with a soft cloth.
1,No return policy and false advertising,"The bowl does not hold 3 cups, as it says it does. It only holds 2 cups. So when I tried to return it, I never heard back from my email response. Now I am stuck with a bowl that is too small, for what I wanted, and no way to return it. This is a rip-off."
2,Very small and plastic like,"I ordered the 24oz bowl not realizing it would be so small. It also doesn't hold 24oz, it only holds 20oz, I measured. It has a very plastic appearance and feel. I was quite disappointed."
5,Does the trick,Got this card for my LG 9800 V phone and it works perfectgreat value for the money...
4,Works great,Just a quick review to say that the miniSD card worked great for my application (additional cell phone memory).
1,Old News,"I was looking for a reference book that would help me learn Audio/Visual terminology.The book I received was copywritten in 1998. As technology has most certainly changed ten...twentyfold since then, I find the usefullness of this item to be limited...very limited. While I did purchase this item for little of nothing (the cost of shipping was actually greater than the cost of the book, it is no bargain if the definitions are dated."
5,Definitely helps the diarrhea!!!,"I used it when my son caught a stomach virus and within two to three days, his stool was firm again. Right on the heels of that, though, he got an ear infection and had to go on antibiotics, which caused diarrhea and a terrible diaper rash. Within few days of Isomil DF and some balmex, the diarrhea is not as bad as it would be without it. And my 9 month old (who was the biggest fan of breastmilk) LOVES the taste. I highly recommend."
3,THREE AND A HALF STARS,"Shuggie Otis was/is a great guitar player, and this CD showcases a lot of what he has to offer, HOWEVER, that being said the only fault I can find with him is that he truly did not have a ""style' of his own. He is emulating other guitar player's styles on this CD and the cuts are good, but nothing original. Kind of reminds me in a way of Wynton Marsalis, a great trumpet player but someone who does not have his own ""sound"". Given he was only a kid when he made this record, but still. I think he sells vitamins and health food now."
5,A Thin Line Between Myth and Reality,"Gloria Naylor's novel touches our inner conscience and causes us to question the thin line between myth and reality. Naylor describes a world where mankind controls the elements of the air, their own destiny, and reality. Her descriptive passages allows her readers to enter into her world of magic in such a way, that one could delightfully lose themselves in the expression of her words. Willow Springs is a place where the whispers of our ancestors tingle our ears with secrets of the past and future. It is an excellent book to sit down, relax, and cross over a mental 'bridge' into an unmapped dimension."
1,"Rather dull, colorless series","Does anyone but me find this first season to be incredibly dull? The episodes really are not that interesting. Maybe it is the writing that I do not care for.Don't get me wrong -- I absolutely LOVE Marlo Thomas and I like her character in this series. That is not the problem at all. I just find the episodes from this season to be dull and lackluster. The only time it really is amusing is when Marlo's father's character becomes annoyed. Other than that, I do not find much humor in this series.This series is just lacking something and I cannot quite put my finger on it. Most other 1960s series I have seen draw you in and make you really want to find out what happens next. But this one, at least for me, does not. Perhaps the show got better in later seasons?"
3,My comment,I like the whole complete first season but i like this show but i dont like the way it ended
2,Not Merry,This is not one of Reba's better cds. She sounded more like Dolly on this. the songs were not that great I must have been sleep walking when I purchased this.
1,Skulls of Sedona,"I count myself a New Ager and I've been to Sedona and loved it. I was hoping to relive some great memories of the natural beauty and to be reminded of the great energy and vitality there. I was sadly disappointed.Ripley is more focused on debunking New Age anything and on building male fantasies based on sex than in even a coherent story line. There are big gaps in action, little sense of mystery, and just plain bad syntax. Sorry, I didn't finish it and I threw it away rather than allow others to share my disappointment!"
3,THE SILVER SCREEN'S SEXY SIREN FROM A TO Z,"Everything you always wanted to know about the silver screen&#65533;s sexiest star --- from A to Z --- in one expensive, heavy book that belongs (only) on the shelves of die-hard devotees.Topics include &#65533;babysitting,&#65533; &#65533;hair,&#65533; &#65533;Arthur Miller&#65533; and more quotes about and by Marilyn than you can shake a Demerol at. One of our faves is this bon mot featuring Marilyn on (what else?) sex: &#65533;No sex is wrong if there&#65533;s love in it. But too often people act like it&#65533;s gymnasium work, mechanical.&#65533; Proof that Marilyn supported the Olympics?"
5,Hidden Treasures,"The Journeymen were as good as it gets. They were great arrangers, musicians and vocalists. You might want to consider buying their three individual albums instead of this ""best of"" series. It includes a lot of bonus material and great stuff released for the first time. You can really hear the beginnings of the Mamas and Papas sound..."

3,works good,"i use shark bites all the time fast and easy, if you need a quick fix. no leaks if you cut it clean, need to have the removel tool when working with these"
4,Just fine,"Was just what I expected from descriptionA little rough around the edges, but fineSimilar to other Steichen books"
2,not a big hit,"I got this for my daughter's 4th birthday. I was excited to find it, since she loved to play the game at a popular children's restaraunt. She was excited when she opened the box, but it faded after playing the game 1 time. The spiders are hard to stomp, and it's hard to figure out how to get the right ""mode"" on the game. a waste of my money. It's going in the next garage sale."
1,No Stompin Here,"I found this game extremely frustrating. At first I thought my four year-old wasn't heavy enough to stomp the spiders. But even I, a 150 pound woman, rarely made the ""stomp"" on the spiders. It did not work any better on hard wood, tile, or carpeted floors. The games are too quickly over - only 30 seconds in length and the multiple lights on the spiders are confusing to youngsters. I am very, very, very sorry I bought this toy. Now I have to pay shipping to return it.....I would not recommend this toy for children or adults (since I couldn't even make it work)."
1,OUCH!!!,"What a let down. My 4 yr. old couldn't wait for Santa to bring this. He ""tried"" playing it and wanted to send it back to the North Pole. My husband and I both had achy feet. I definitely would'nt recommend."
2,"Great show, very bad video quality","I loved Lariat Sam as a kid, and was looking forward to seeing it again. I enjoyed what I was able to see very much, but the quality of the video was very bad. There were supposed to be two cartoons, but only the first would play at all."
4,the guyver anime show is awesome,this is an awesome video as well as an anime explosion. If you like this one should collect the series. Amazon.com is probaly one of the few places youll find this video. at the end of every episode they give you info on each guyver and new zoanoid. But before you buy this watch guyver 1 and 2. beleive me you wont be disapointed if your an anime fan.
4,Works Great,I actually order 2x-3x first cause I thought the sizes were fake and if i need an xl i should get one bigger but needless to say the 2x-3x fit like a 2x-3x so i kept that one for my father and brought another one this time xl it fits pretty good. The are easy to wash and stays its shape. Actually makes you swaet takes an 1 hour turns it into a 30 mintues worout at least the walking on the treadmill part of it. Over all it works great and the size is true.
4,Get what you pay for,"I'd say this is worth the 5 bucks. Handy, easy to use, covers all the functions of a D70. I keep it in my holster pack, & reference it from time to time. Not an in depth book, but what do you really expect for 5 bucks."
5,Mesmerizing and Captivating: for Barker and Gaiman Fans,"From what I've read, this was Steven Climer's first book. After reading it I now see why he won so many awards and honorable mentions. He set the bar pretty high for himself.Dream Thieves sucks you in innocuously until you're tangled in the horrors of a man who can't dream. The imagery and surrealness put Climer right up there with Barker and Gaiman."
1,You call this a classic?,I was forced to read this book for school. I really thought it was boring and made no sense. I hope Lassiter high school will stop assigning this book.
4,The Fifth Child,"This book is one of the most thought provoking books I've ever read. It really made me think about my own family and also about other people's family values.Doris May Lessing was most diffinately put a moral into this story that over the course of the book is hard to figure out but in the end is very clear. I believe the book is really about society and how it turns away and tries to forget about the abnormal or strange.I loved the way Doris May Lessing wrote this book. It is written in a very straight forward way. If this book has any flaws, it is the lack of character development.I would recomend this book but I'm not sure to who."
1,If you use digital media go with another collection,The scrambling of the track number and labels makes this collection nigh unlistenable on digital media such as itunes or an mp3 player.
1,ruin your cd/dvd,"ruined my dvd's. got stuck in my computers disk drive. if you want your discs to look good, buy these labels. if you want your discs to work properly, leave them alone."
1,Do not use ANY labels on your cd's/dvd's!,"Down the line, it will cause problems for your computer to read these discs. Got one cd with label stuck in my iMac right now, it won't come out. I now use an external reader/writer, and it has problems with labeled cd's, so does my car cd-player and my regular cd player (and I don't buy junk electronics). Just be safe, use a permanent marker to label your discs, may not look as cool, but at least you can still use them."
5,Good Value,Comes in a plastic casing which is nice. This product is a great value. I'll buy again when I need to restock.
1,0 Rating for Mac or Apple users,Spent a couple of hours looking at APPLE sites and Memorex sites and many more trying to find a template. They say these might work if you have WORD on the Mac. I was tech support for a couple of years and I cannot find a good way to use these labels; so for the moment they are worthless to me. I'd rate them as 0 if i could. This link might help some but it did not help me.[...]Another website said flat out they are not compatible with MAC.
3,a little condescending,"I love the main story, but the purpose of THIS book is to make it ""for teens"". This is done through a conversational beginning and final chapter, with teens talking instead of adults, as in the original. The conversations are irrlelevant to true problems and conversations with teenagers. I'd rather see some type of activities, questions or focal points for young people. Anyone who works with youth knows that you can't talk down to them. Whoever wrote these chapters, be it the regular author or an assistant, is not in tune with how to work with teenagers. The story is still excellent for teens, but needs to be surrounded by better material."
3,Cheese,"Pretty good, gave it to my daughter, hope she finds it helpful in goal setting and planning her life and her financial future"
3,Could have been better,"My partner and I watched this last night with high expectations. After all, Latter Days was such a wonderful movie. Big disappointment. Some of the acting was not up to par, and I kept waiting for some really good dialogue between the characters, but it never happened.My biggest beef with this movie is the scene where the gay guy is making out with the fiance of ""the love of his life"". That was so wrong; it didn't work with the rest of the movie. I lost all respect for him at that moment. It didn't make any sense at all, and more or less ruined what was otherwise a fair movie."
1,Poor Tech info.,"I needed to know opening size, dimensions,and so forth. This was totally inadequate. How hard can that be. I see I am not the only person. Went elsewhere to buy."
1,Godawful Film -- Worst of 2007,"Ohmygawd, what a terrible film! Both my wife and I love Robin Williams,but he was utterly and completely terrible in this role. The writerswanted you to laugh at his antics and find him cute and adorable. Wefound his character annoying, pathetic and disgusting. His character ispsychotic, and probably a pedophile, with a 12-year old sidekick withhim 24/7. Egads. This is supposed to be a comedy? He spends the wholemovie destroying the relationship of a happy couple through numerouscringe-inducing actions. The couple later reconcile -- no thanks to him-- and then THANK him? For what? What were the writers thinking?Terrible, terrible movie. Left us both annoyed and disgusted. The bestpart of the movie (well, the only good part) is when Robin Williams'character gets decked. I would have kicked him a few times while he wasdown too.Avoid at all costs. We rented the movie for $[...] at Red Box. Wasn'teven worth that."
5,HILLARIOUS MOVIE,"Robin Williams and John Krasinski are incredibly funny! I laughed over and over again! I must have watched this movie 5 times and I am STILL laughing. Some of the comedy borders on stupid, but it is a clever story with a sweet ending."
2,No regular DVD?,"Where is the regular DVD release for this film? The only listings on Amazon are for blu-ray and HD DVD, both of which I refuse to buy since I don't want to upgrade my massive DVD collection.This will suck massively if they start releasing movies to blu-ray and HD only."
1,Please kill me,"Is it humanly possible to make a movie any more retarded than this? I think not. It's not funny, just awkward and painful. I couldn't even finish it, it was so bad. Obviously, the writers never learned the difference between funny and stupid...Robin Williams is such a great actor, why does he agree to star in garbage like this?So NOT recommended."
2,Not Very Funny,"This movie was just, eh. I thought it'd be worth a watch. Most Robin Williams movies are fairly good. And I've always liked Mandy Moore. This movie was not good at all though. I mean some parts were just borderline creepy. The only good parts was that, as always, John Krasinski shines. He's the only good part of the movie."
2,Awful,They took one of my favorite actresses and made me hate her. I love Mandy Moore. How could they do this to her? I like Robin Williams. I hated him in this movie too. The only person I didn't hate was the guy.The movie started out great with the young couple meeting and it was a sweet and charming movie at that point. And then Robin Williams enters the picture and it's all down hill from there. The moment I got hit in the face with a baseball would be the time I said to Mandy Moore that the wedding is off. And the scene where she's blind folded and driving is just idiotic. She nearly killed people and then is mad at her finance because they don't communicate well enough.And then there's the minister Robin Williams who sends a child in to illegally break into people's homes and illegally wiretap them.The best part of the movie was when the guy finally punches Robin Williams. He was also the only bright spot in this movie. I'll give it 2 stars for him. Sorry I don't know his name.
3,Bill's raunchy debut,"Fans of ""In Another Land"" from the Stone's Satanic Majesty album will find nothing familiar on this album. Having got any acid rock pretense out of his system with that '67 tune, Bill emerges seven years later with a fun, raunchy album more akin to his ""Downtown Suzy"" B-Side. Bill is not Cat Stevens, nor does he wish to be. Simple, down and dirty. Strictly for fun."
3,Normal digital watch,"I purchased this to have something for running and to do outdoor activities with, since my Gucci watch is not at all appropriate! I was expecting a standard digital watch which is what I got. A little on the flimsy side I guess, but it was very inexpensive. Setting the time was a little tricky for some reason, even when following the instructions. I haven't used the stopwatch feature on it yet. I would say that if you have very small wrists you may need to punch another hole in the band. I have mine on the smallest hole and although I have small-ish wrists, I'm not petite by any means."
3,Good watch; cheaply made,I bought this watch to replace my old Timex 1440 and I love it. One problem I ran into was that within the first week of normal wear one of the silver side pieces fell off. So now I can no longer wear my water resistant watch in water. Cute color combo though.
4,"Like it alot, except for one thing.","I really like this watch. It's comfortable to wear to work everyday. The only complaint I have is setting it. Even with the instructions, it's hard to set. I'm not really sure how I did it the first time, but now with Daylight Savings, I can't reset it, so I just have to add an hour for the next 6 months till we change again. Or maybe I can find someone who can figure it out."
5,Timex sports,"This watch is amazing value. It is easy to use, easy to read and provides all I need in a watch for running and swimming."
4,"Excellent value for a teen watch, tho' can't turn beep off",I purchased this watch for my 13 year old. She loves the watch and find it meets all of her timing needs. The only annoying feature is that there is a 'beep' every time any button is pushed and nowhere in the directions does it say how to turn the beep off. Overall all a great value for an everyday watch.
3,does what it says,"The watch works fine, but you need good eyesight and coordination to change settings. But that is a tradeoff for the small size in a digital watch. I needed something waterproof to swim with for not much money, and this does the trick for me"
3,Good sample activities for older kids,I'm a PT and got this book for ideas for breath support activities. It has a lot of good ideas for older children that are high functioning (I would say cog. level of about 4yrs+.
2,"Hokey, but it's meant to be",A little more hokey than most low budget movie from the 50's. Fun to watch if its raining outside and there is little else to do. At a minimum it's fun to watch to know that anyone with a good camcorder and a good editing software could do as good.
3,Here you have B film glory,"This film freeked me out as a kid, and I saw it on TV at my Grandmother's house at 1:00am. I got it just a few days ago. It was still a bit freeky. The story is simple: A few people in the woods, in a cabin, and an alien woman walking around who can kill with a touch of her hands.The problem with this DVD is the SOUND! Hello! Who ever signed off on this thing should be ashamed. My TV had to be near Max Volume to hear what was being said.That said, it's a cheesey B film. Just be sure to turn the volume back down before shutting the DVD player off."
1,sci-fi,"Pretty stupid, like most of that era. Cheap theatrics, costumes and storyline. Not worth renting."
4,A must see video for NHRA racing fans!,"This is a historical review of how NHRA was started, with early video clips included. It revisits the events and actual record-breaking races that stunned the competitive world. Interviews with the people that pioneered this sport are interesting and informative. I enjoyed this video."
1,Piece of junk!,"This is the worst piece of junk I've ever seen! It's bad enough we get so much cheap stuff dumped on us from China. This kind of junk gets shoved down our throats and for me it's NOT OK. This item is worthless. It is now sitting at the end of my driveway waiting for the trash man because it's too worthless to bother trying to send it back. [...] shame on you for selling this junk. Amazon, don't buy from the sellers that are pushing junk like this on your customers. Customers, don't waste your money."
2,Pretty but didn't use it,"Before our family trip for 10 days throughout Germany, I purchased a few different travel guides. After having each of them in hand before leaving home, we didn't even put this one in our luggage. I reccommend Daytrips Germany, 6th Edition 1st and then Rick Steves' Germany and Austria 2006. Those 2 books were great for finding tourist sites, great restaurants and hotels that could accomodate 2 adults and 2 kids (most hotels don't have rooms with 2 beds!)"
2,I've Seen Better,"I would not recommend this travel book. Compared to other travel books I have used this one doesn't have much for information in it. There are some nice pictures in the book that are in color, but it is lacking information on the different towns it talks about. I have seen better books then this one."
4,"OK, but where is Legoland?","I used this book during my April 2004 trip to Bavaria, Germany and found it helpful. It catered mainly to tourists interested in fine art and I could have used more 'quirky' trips and a guide to out of the way places. It also didn't include anything about Legoland which is about an hour north of Garmisch (where we stayed). I traveled with my 2 kids and this book didn't seem to have any info on places catering to or of interest to kids. Overall it was a great book and we saw many sights, but I could have used more. This had the BIG attractions--where are the little 'Mom and Pop' places we love, also???"
3,Too ambitious.,"I find DK eyewitness travel guides the best way to get to know a country and to plan a trip around it. The books about a certain city are definitively the best I've ever read. However, in this particular case of Germany, I think they didn't achieve that level of perfection noticed in other guides. The problem is that there are so many places to visit in Germany that they simply do not fit in a pocket sized guide. Therefore, the lack of space is paid with lack of useful information and the whole guides results extremely good for having an overview of Germany and planning your trip, but almost useless by the time you get there. Say you decide to visit Stuttgart, Munich Nuremberg and Berlin; then you'll be using no more than 25% of this guide. That means, a lot of useless weight on your backpack."
1,Disappointed,"Okay, I'm 60 yrs. old so maybe my tastes have changed, but I was disappointed. They really could not sing. The two songs I wanted were not even on the CD. Don't know what I was thinking."
3,Pirates! Magic! Zombies!,"Decided to read this after I heard it was the basis for the 4th installment of the 'Pirates of the Caribbean' series. The story contains real characters (eg Blackbeard, Stede Bonnet, Ann Bonny etc.) and historical fact. Powers has basically filled in the historical blanks, with a tale of voodoo and black magic. Pirates, zombies, black magic, a quest for the Fountain of Youth all add up to an enjoyable story."
3,Didn't like the main character,"I loved all the action, zombies, voodoo, and spirits but I thought the main character was kind of lame. Some of the explanations were a bit of a stretch too.I'm coming to this book after reading _The Anubis Gates_ (last year) and I really liked that so this book was a bit of a dissappointment. I would suggest it to Powers fans, but don't come into it thinkiing it's going to be another _Anubis Gates_."
3,Not at the height of his Powers,"I am a true fan of Tim Powers and have read almost all of his books from Drawing of the Dark onwards.On Stranger Tides rates as my least favourite. It reads well, in parts, but seems to lack an overall coherence of structure. There were too many Good Ideas to make it work as a whole.Still, even an average Tim Powers novel is a more satisfying read than most in the genre."
3,An extremely ongoing and compelling adventure!,"A race of dwarfs living in an isolated continent where they lived in peace and hormony. The main city is this continent is focused on Slippery-on-the-??? One day the mayor anounced that that they shall have a contest. Which ever city paints their houses the most beautiful shall win the Gammage Cup. They had a wonderful life unitl one day they had news that the ""mushroom"" will invade them. The mushrooms were known only as a legend until one day they did appear and tried to take over the continent (forgot the name). The minipins came up with ideas over ideas and finally one person had the courage to confront them. Okay...you have to read yourself if you want the ending...hehe.."
4,The Gammage Cup IS great according to Ashley!,"I think that the Gammage Cup was great. I thought that since we had to read it in school that it wouldn't be good but I was wrong. This book is about 5 outlaws who go live up in the mountains. They have some swords from their ancestors that are all black, but then they light up mysteriously. These outlaws find some unwanted visitors and try to save the town in time. Could it be too late for the Land Between the Mountains? Could there live come to an end with their worst fear?"
5,Common Sense Discipline,"Very pleased with this book and would highly recommend it to any loving parent who wishes to use a more common sense approuch when it comes to discipline. Ignore the negative comments from those who have obviously not even read this book, and abuse this review section to debate with others, and talk of their political views."
1,the heroine rides in with the paddle,"Once again, yet another ""fundamentalist supermom""-- paddle in hand,rides in to save the day from bratty, horrible kids.At least this author is not a former child actress, and at leastshe has the courage to use the word ""spanking"" rather than the standard fundamentalist euphemism ""discipline.""When are all of these fundamentalists going to realize that they are damaging the cause of Christ with all of this thinly veiled S&M; stuff? Eegads!!!"
4,"Howard Duff, a man dedicated to the scientific conquest of space.","Deceived by a woman dedicated to pleasure.At a secret rocket base in England, a small group of dedicated scientists is attempting to put the first artificial satellite in orbit. Meanwhile back at the base there is hanky-panky between a biologist and someone else's bored wife, Vanessa Mitchell (Cecile Chevreau.) Little do they know the biologist is more that he seems to be until one day the two disappear? Small base. Secured base. Where can they be? Did someone suggest the third stage and Dr. Stephen Mitchell (Howard Duff) the husband seems to be more interested in space and his hand held calculator, Dr. Lisa Frank (Eva Bartok.) than the disappearance of his wife and the biologist?According to military intelligence (Alan Wheatley), we know whodunit and how. However, can it be proven?Boys' Night Out [VHS]"
1,spacewaste or trashways...,"...very boring: some space stock footage & to complete your very un-exciting space action-final original Boring...,(well take off was ok but maybe stock f.),..Space scenes (to match the stock f.). Space station on dvd cover not even in movie.most of film is about folks talking on planet earth england. what a plain plot; it doesnt show the action how one does one in-(which was probably done on planet earth) or specifically more, why.Waste of $; only worth seeing once or twice?-but only for cheaaaaap, yeah right-higher cost than that, luckily only apx 2.78 or more, ha."
3,campy but fun,This film is worth the look to see a young lloyd bridges. Dont expect to be glued to the screen as the film does move slow..The dialogue and acting are very basic but the story line is interesting. I probably would not have purchased it if i had previewed elsewhere
3,Entry level,"I bought this book based on the title, which for me was a mistake. I was expecting drawing and guidance on making reproductions of time honored classics. While it is helpful it lacks the details about the originals that are needed to built future classics."
5,Beautiful sleeve,"I wish Das Blau would describe the sleeve better since it surpassed my expectations by far, it has a nice shimmering lining inside, is well made, feels good, the Nano plus sleeve still fit into my pocket. Great product value..I bought a red, black and a brown."
4,"Difficult read, but worth it","As Meat Loves Salt is a very difficult read. This isn't a love story as much as it is a story about obsession and the way it can crack the unstable foundations of an uneasy alliance. The book is meticulous in its research, and for that I give the author much credit. You know the work and effort that went into this book when you actually feel like you are right there along with the characters.The ending, while realistic, is very hard to read. It fits with the story, but this is not a book about happily ever after."
2,"Well written, just.... ugh.","McCann wrote a rich, detailed and realistic depiction of Cromwellian England. She has an eye for detail that made me really REALLY want to like this book. Unfortunately, the main character is a self-obsessed whiner who constantly sabotages himself. I wanted to like him, and I wanted to root for him, but toward the end of the book, I had a hard time seeing his story through to the end.This is an excellent book for people who like endings where little is resolved, and who like having to read the last chapter three times in order to figure out what happened. It's also good for people who enjoy dark, cheerless tales with their protagonists self-absorbed and incapable of moving past their mistakes. I don't want to be too harsh on the book, but it's just not my cup of tea."
2,Henley Fizzles Solo,"I love Don Henley but I love him with the Eagles. In this show, once you get past the Nehru jacket, the orange hair & the dark glasses, he barely tries to give anything resembling a performance. He stands there looking smug, virtually saying to his audience 'don't I write great lyrics' and 'I'm a great singer, aren't I'. The appallingly offhand version of The Heart Of The Matter has been swamped by the Eagles' Hell Freezes Over version. What he does to his most famous song, Hotel California, beggars belief. Those legendary gravel-lined vocal chords are no more than adequate. And perhaps this is being petty, but the anonymous band are given two separate credits for a 'Musical Director' and a 'Band Leader', both of which, when Henley is in his rightful place with the Eagles, are handled by someone called G. Frey, without a credit."
2,Not The 5th I loved,"Minus Marilyn McCoo and Billy Davis, the 5th dimension just isn't the same....and the worst idea was to Remake old 5th hits. Better moments are ""Shining Star"" but I would guess the only folks that bought this cd in the first place were OLD time fans of the group.and only the MOST die hards would really like this effort."
5,Debut Is A Winner!!!,This author's debut novel is a winner! I honestly couldn't put it down until I'd finsihed it. The story was intriguing and very suspensful and it had me turning page after page. I loved the way he brought the characters to life. Hope to read more by this talented new author.
1,Waste of time,"Murphy's Law: Sequels will get progressively worse.Fist season was great, second season good, Third OK. 4th season worse.Good thing, it is free. After 2 episodes you loose interest."
4,If you like Damages....,If you like Damages.... You will enjoy this season. Sure they killed off my favorite character but Rose and Glen steal the show! Gotta love John Goodman as a hesitant villain!
5,"if you want to see and feel healing, buy this dvd!","i am very impressed with this film. i am a believer and that helps, and it is good to see and hear the healers!"
1,Broken!,"What a piece of junk! I ordered this thinking it's a bucket - how hard can it be? I just wanted one with wheels. They sent me a broken piece of junk fit for the land fill. The handle on one side is completely off and since the plastic is chipped around where it would go, it is not fixable. What jerk saw this bucket, boxed it, and sent it to me? Any half wit can see it is broken. The bucket is completely unusable and now I have to hassle around with trying to send it back. I don't know who pays return shipping yet, but I'm going to be so angry if these jerks expect me to pay for return shipping when they obviously knowingly sent me a broken product."
2,Q-See QS2350C Camera With Blower,The camera does not have sufficient information to tell you why or how the circulating blower works. Although it gives great video (somewhat blurred) in daylight it also gives good video in color at night for a very good distance these attributes cannot be overcome by the large size and the fact that it requires the power source (110 outlet) where the camera is located. Power cannot be supplied over a dual wire cable similar to other Q-See cameras. Would not recommend due to size and power requirement.
4,"Nice blade, does the job","Purchased for tighter radius curve cutting. Does the job and fits my 14"" generic bandsaw just fine. Seems to hold its edge for a long time, provided you do not force the cut and let the blade do the work, and provided you have your badsaw guides set correctly for the thinner blade."
2,Holding off for now,"Based on the Above reveiws i will hold off until Universal does this Alfred Hitchcock collection the quality transfers it deserves.Especially MARNIE and FRENZY,Thanks to BOB for the heads up."
5,Al's the best,What more can be said about Hitchcock's movies that has not already been said. This comes in a very nice book type format. Really well done.
5,Masterpiece,"This item is absolutely breath taking. If you are a fan of HITCH, this is a must have. Perfect condition, shipping was on time and this is one of the most best collections I have owned. I recommend this to any one that is a fan of a legend."
2,Exploration and Empire,"As an historian I have always been admirer of Dr Goetzmann and although the book was a good overview of the topic it had errors, some possibly due to editing and some of fact. I felt his generalizations were a little too positive and based on his own opinion rather than documentation. The maps in this edition were unreadable and is bizarre when one looks at the topic of the book. Maps make up a large part of the story and if we cannot read them then a large part of this story is missing."
2,Two-and-a-half stars,"Yet another book I bought at a used book sale (paperback; perfect conditon; $1) years ago, and just got around to reading recently.The story takes place in Washington, D.C; the plot concerns the protagonist, Jack, and his break-up from Nina. We never get to see them in happy times, and Nina is an amorphous character, at best. A sign of a good book is that you are rooting for the hero to get back with his supposed lady love; I did not care in the least.This is a debut novel. I have not even checked to see if Ackerman has written others. That says it all concerning my opinion of this book."
5,L-Carnitine is imperative to heart health,This booklet was easy to understand in its explanation of why L-Carnitine is imperative to heart health. I immediately went out to purchase a bottle. Heart disease runs in my family and I don't want to ladled with medications that pose more problems tomy health.
1,A colonialist view,This book is a perfect example of the double standards being used in the narratives on the erstwhile colonies. Indian nationalism is to be termed fascism whether it flies in the face of facts or not. Jaffrelot's scholarship is biased and he is not able to rise above the one-sided Leftist critiques that are to be encountered in the English press in India. This book fails to show the light.
2,Really poor job!,I received flowers twice from my mother. The vase was smashed BOTH times! The second time I emailed the florist who sent - not a new vase - but a new bouquet. Weird!
1,No Show,"Hard to actually rate the product, as it never came. It was apparently cancelled because Falcon made an error in their pricing. They did refund the money, but they never actually indicated that the order had been cancelled. No likely htat I will ever take a chance on an order from them again. Fool me once......"
1,Farm of Thieves!,"AVOID AT ALL COSTS!They canceled my order because of a ""computer glitch"" give me a break! and they didnt even refund me all my money.They stole my time and money, thanks Thieves Farm!"
1,"Awful, terrible and a waste of money",The flowers arrived almost dead and barely lasted a day only. Most did not even opened. I will never buy flowers from this provider ever again.
1,never got to use it,panini grill came in an inner and outer box. Both were in good shape. No indication of being droped or damaged. When I opended the inner box and took off the packing styro foam the hindge to the machine was broken I called Gildas Kitchen. They sent me a return shipping UPS sticker and I shiped it back to Krups.I was told by Gaildas that Krups wanted to inspect it. Soooooooooo far I have not heard from Krups or Gilda. I have not recieved a credit yet. I have put it in dispute. I had asked Gildas for a credit as they did not know when they would be getting more machines. It was a christmas present to my wife.
4,A fun satire,"Lee Goldberg must have had a lot of fun writing this book, and I certainly had fun reading it. I can imagine that Goldberg's tongue was firmly in his cheek as his protagonist wanders through a post-earthquake Los Angeles, desperately seeking to get back to the comfort and security of his gated community in the Valley. Along the way he encounters more trials and tribulations than Job. But he keeps picking himself up and wandering on to the next disaster to be inflicted upon him. There's a lot of humorous sarcasm directed at Hollywood and its producers, scriptwriters, directors and other denizens, and at their inflated self-importance and ego-battles. This book reminded me of ""Candide"" by Voltaire."
3,"Good, but not sooo good","I had just read The 100-Year-Old Man Who Climbed Out the Window and Disappeared, so I was trying to find something similar that made me laugh. The Walk made me laugh, but not so much. In my opinion the story is good, the main characters are ok, but the ending was a bit predictable."
4,"Good, Believable Book","I picked this one up based on a recommendation someone made on the monthly ""What Are You Reading on Your Kindle"" poll in the Amazon Kindle discussion board. I was not disappointed. The author does a good job with character development, and I could realistically think of this situation happening to someone who lived in Southern California (or any other place with a natural disaster).I'm not going to have a spoiler, but he got me with the ending with his characters - I'm looking forward to seeing more books from this guy! Bottom line is this is a great value - go support your independent author!"
3,Good quick read,I needed a break from my normal series and enjoyed this book. I'll try another from this author. I'm intrigued.
2,one dimensional,"The story line was the only real focus. There were no intermingled plots. The characters weren't well developed, so you just didn't care about them. I flipped through pages of ""blah blah"" until I hit something interesting again. I wouldn't recommend this book."
4,Well worth a read!,"A very satisfying read- combining a good canvas of post apocalyptic proportions with a main protagonist who you genuinely care for and begin to understand and empathize with. The twist in the tale (won't give a spoiler here by going further) was a bit tame since I thought I had figured it out well along the way, but still a very good read and more than worth it."
3,"Entertaining, not informative.","I thought the book was ok, not great, and not what I expected.Cons: I was hoping for survival fiction, survival information incorporated with fiction, but there was almost no usable information ala James Wesley Rawles or J.L. Bourne. Anyone looking to learn when reading fiction should look elsewhere. This was the story of a guy meeting colorful characters and situations on his way home. I found the main character unlikeable as well, shallow, selfish, lives in movies and T.V. And I thought the price high for a 180 pg book.Pros: the secondary characters are mostly lively, funny and entertaining to read. The dialogue is good as well, it just wasn't the book I was hoping for."
4,Suprising book!,"This is an...odd...and surprisingly good, book. It's odd because the book is nothing more than the simple premise of a man walking home after ""the Big One"" while facing his own demons. An excellent read and quite a page turner."
3,"Good, but could have been great...","The Walk has the makings of a great story - an ordinary man on an average day is forced into an extraordinary situation. Essentially, the world around him has been destroyed and he is left with a single goal, to get home to his wife. The man, Marty Slack, starts his long walk across an earthquake-ravaged Los Angeles, and finds his strength, will, and even sanity pushed to the limit.The first two-thirds of the book have a definite ""Richard Bachman"" (also known as Stephen King) feel to the writing. The main character is not someone to be admired or seen as larger than life. Marty is a depressing and unlikeable man who only redeems himself when forced to do so.The problem with The Walk is the simplistic and unrewarding ending. I can still recommend this book as a fun read for the price, but be prepared to agree with some of the more negative reviews."
5,The Walk,I truly enjoyed this tale. Living in so Cal myself made the story hit even closer to home. The main character is surprisingly 3 dimensional and believable. The quest to get home at any cost is one that any Californian could envision themselves doing. The people and scenarios he encounters on his trek are heartbreaking and real.And the ending? Perfect. It was an unexpected gem.Thank you Mr Goldberg. I had picked this one up as a freebie on one of your promo days and remain ever grateful.
2,Expected more,"I have not read any of this authors other books and probably won't be doing so after this one. What could have been a good strory fizzled and died... I couldn't relate to the characters and I kept waiting for the climax, but the story never really got there. In the end I just waded through it so that I could finish it and put it away."
4,Not bad...Not great!,A quick lite read. Won't win any awards.You need to be at least 50 tounderstand some of the references.
5,Incredible folk-indie!,"All I can say is that Red Hunter (peter and the wolf) is one of the greatest song-writers of our time (in my opinion), and this album brings in elements of nature, love, and travel into simple tunes that you can't just play once. I would recommend this album to anyone!"
2,Skip it,"The first song I ever heard from Peter and the Wolf was ""Safe Travels"". That song is so great, I thought I'd just buy the album thinking other songs would be comparably good. What a waste of money. This album is terrible! All the songs and dark, the music doesn't match up with the lyrics or tone, he sounds like he's just complaining and whining. Honestly, save your money and just buy the song ""Safe Travels"" on its own for 99cents. It is the only song worth listening to. If you don't believe me, listen to the samples and you'll see."
4,Special dishes for special days special indeed,This book though a bit crowded with print that MAY be a bit small--is still an EYE-CATCHER for children with great color and illustrations. The recipes are easy and pertinent to the foods that children love.A great idea for a gift!!
2,Enkay Push Drill,"This is a relatively small push drill. I was actually looking for something larger I could use aronud the house. This is used for hobbies and crafts. The largest bit is a #61 (.039""). On the plus side it does come with 20 drill bits. It is made in China and ships separately."
3,Annoying Jazz soundtrack,"Unlike my other two ""HDMoods"" blu-rays (Aquarium and Fire), this one does not offer various options for the soundtrack. You are stuck with the annoying jazz music or just hitting the mute button. It would have been much better (and more relaxing) if you could choose a ""natural"" soundtrack, like soothing surf sounds. With the Aquarium and Fire blu-rays, you can choose just bubble sounds or crackling fire sounds, or you can choose ""spa-like"" music, or you can choose a blend of both! I was disappointed that Blu Ocean doesn't provide several options. Let's face it, jazz is not for everyone. That being said, the visuals are still stunning."
3,"I LOVE this, but....","I have to say that this is an absolutely marvelous performance of Fledermaus. It's extremely funny, it's in English (yeah!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!), and everyone in the cast sings superbly (wow, I love the countertenor). The acting is excellent too, and not artificial and forced (nothing is worse than canny, forced comedy), like other Fledermaus performances I've seen. BUT... there's always that ""but""...Sutherland's appearance ruined this beautiful performance. I don't care if it's a farewell to her; she comes walking in and delivers poor, poor performances (not to mention completely breaking the flow of the Fledermaus performance as a whole). Sutherland's voice is a huge mess and unbearable to hear. This is NOT what I want to hear from a farewell from Sutherland. Bad memories! Pavarotti is okay, and Horne as always is excellent. This really would've been a 5-star DVD, but the one who inspired it ruined it!"
3,Good for novice traders,"IMHO, an essential part of being a good trader is having a good sense of how things function on Wall Street. If you are a new trader this a book you should consider picking up. Beyond entertaining, it will offer you a good set of anecdotes to help you frame who the players are and how things work on Wall Street. Beyond this book, you should consider other anecdotal books that feature successful traders like Market Wizards, New Market Wizards (both by Jack Schwager), and The Best by Marder and Dupee. When you have built your framework for understanding the trading environment, take a look at a simple book on technical analysis - Dave Landry on Swing Trading or Bulkowski's Encyclopedia of Chart Patterns. If you have a decent grasp on the technical analysis part, then try a simple strategy like the 1-Day Breakout Method, it looks pretty good from what I've read so far and I look forward to trading it shortly."
1,Stunk,Simply didn't work It was like rubber. You can't put rubber on your face it just does not work. sad
1,Lame.,"Not even the same kit from the photo, and there is hardly any paint in any of the sections. Do yourself a favor and shop around for a better kit."
2,didn't help me,"I was hoping the chi vitalizer would help my neuropathy and circulation, but it actually made my neuropathy feel worse. It kind of increased the numbness and tingling, plus the feeling like my feet were covered with saran wrap. Really disappointed, because I had great hope for this because I have other foot problems and can't walk for exercise at this time. I know a couple of other people the chi has helped. The machine is well made. I got my money back without any problem, they took out money for shipping tho."
4,chi machine,"This product works for me. It is relaxing, but energizes at the same time. I love to use it after a long stressful day.I would caution people to not put too much weight on it. If heavy people use it, make sure they don't put too much weight on it and they balance the weight of their feet carefully while finding a comfortable position for their feet. If not, the machine will make a grinding noise that is quite irritating."
4,Yeah not bad,"I tried the ""original chi machine"" but it was too expensive IMO. In the end I watched a review on youtube and this one came up trumps.Its variable speed is great so you to work up slowly to a good speed rather that deal with a set value which might not suit. I also like the padding on the ankle grips... this was probably my main gripe with the previous one I tried. Padding is essential, although some of you may still want to put more padding down, like a towel or something.The feeling you get when it stops is kinda weird and very relaxing. For those of you with mad lifestyles and only a few minutes a day to relax, get on this thing. The routine is short, you can do it anywhere you can carry it (it has a handle) and it forces you to let go a bit. If you don't relax your body and work against the flow of the machine its uncomfortable, but go with the flow and you'll have a cool experience.Finally, it seems to put me in a good mood afterwards. Kinda focused too. Yeah, not bad."
5,Great,Daniel Boone -Season 6Go glad I purchased this video for my Western video collection. Always looking for more like it.
2,"Good scientific piece, yet very boring.","This book gives a fantastic look into the scientific aspects of neutron stars, but is very boring to read as a novel"
4,I recommend it!,"Whether you like The Twilight Zone or just want to read some good short stories, this book is for you."
5,Shaun and the Flock have done it again,"I had been a Shaun the sheep fan for two years now, and I love this set by far. espetialy when two of the episodes involve the cutest lamb on earth... Timmy!My favorite episodes where Spring Lambs, locked out, and the other one whtch involves timmy and a tommato that reminds me of Alice in Wonderland."
5,Sing Songs of Christmas,"I have been a Mahalia Jackson fan for many years. I expected this CD to be good, but it was way beyond what I expected. She handles the carols like no one else and stirs the emotions that were written into the music originally. This CD is truly one of the best carol CD's I've ever heard."
4,A slightly better President that the perception.,"A great indication of how a man reacts is when he is placed in adverse situations. I like the American President series because it shows the true mark of these individuals. Chester Arthur suceeded the murdered Garfield (whether by a assasin or his own doctors). He did not want the job but he did his best. He advocated reform of patronage, even though he benefited from the plushest job in the patronage career. He tried to help the black man. He tried to work with a coalition for the betterment of the nation. Ultimately he did not win reelection in his own right. However, he was a just man who died shortly after leaving office.I liked this book as much as the rest of the American President series. These are great reads for those interested in the men who served this office."
5,"Great Variety, Great Music","OK, I bought this for ""Doing Alright on a Saturday Night"" and ""At Midnight"" however, I am happy to report the entire album is very listenable from start to finish. Kind of jazzy, disco, funk and a touch of gospel on ""Got to see my lady"".A great double album. The one question I have is where is their song ""You're moving too slow, gotta let yourself go""? I remember hearing that on WBLS back in 1978."
3,Crack-Pots give alternative sciences a bad name.,"I got what I expected right on the first page-- King refers to his belief that our planet has been and is regularly visited by alien spaceships. Anyone else who does should should read Carl Sagan's ""The Demon Haunted World"" or any of his work. That aside, there is a growing body of scientists who have serious doubts that the Quantum and Relativity theories will ever yield the most complete explaination of physical reality. Some of these other physical theories are based upon the behavior of what is known as the zero point field, more or less as put forth by King in this book. Unfortunately, this book is a collection of essays taken from his lectures over the years, outlining his quest to convince inventors to build free-energy machines. At no time does King discuss past successes, or presumable failures, of the experiments described in his earlier lectures, so his particular theories seem to be fundamentally incorrect."
5,A classic in alternative science,"This is a nice little book. It's a series of articles discussing the possibility to apply the theories of self-organization in the zero-point energy area, i.e. the possibility to extract energy from the vacuum. The ideas put forward here are quite creative. The annotated reference sections are excellent."
2,RECEIVED A GENERIC BATTERY,"IT WAS NOT A REALLY TOSHIBA BRAND, IT WAS A GENERIC LI-ON BATTERY, BUT NOT TOSHIBA BRAND. THERE WERE CHEAPER ONES (GENERIC) LISTED ON AMAZON, BUT I PAYED FOR A ORIGINAL ONE AND RECEIVED A GENERIC ONE.I WAS A LITTLE DISSAPOINTED."
1,AWFUL SOUND TECHNOLOGY,"Among my top 5 bands of the past 50 years, The Moody Blues concert is performed in a beautiful enchanting concert hall. Having seen the band live three times I know what can be. However on this DVD, the sound audio is horrible. It seems distantly mixed or faint. What is Dolby 5.0 anyway? If I were the Moodies I never would have allowed this to be released! It's hard to believe they even listened to it in Dolby 5.0 and allowed it to be released. Only buy this DVD if you have DTS capability. What a disappointment. I returned my copy, came home and listened to an older laser disc concert to restore my mind with the true Moodies."
3,distant voices,"The problem with this DVD is the center channel. The voices are distant, like in another room. The Moodys have never had a good recording engineer in my modest opinion; like Steely Dan for example. Great songs but can't separate the instruments for a crisp sound.Only ""Forever Autumn"" in ""Time Traveler"" collection sounds well recorded. I still enjoyed this DVD. To their credit I have to say that I've listened to three DVDs recorded at Royal Albert Hall and they all sound with the same problem. If anybody can explain, please do so."
5,These guys still look and sound great!,My husband and I saw a TV special late Christmas night with this concert at Royal Albert Hall. It truly was the perfect finish to a wonderful holiday celebration. I was so excited to order this disc the next day. We have played it several times at dinner parties since then and it has been a big hit with all our guests. These guys still looked and sounded great...they are amazing!
3,"Great Sound, But Mostly an Eyesore","Like other reviewers, I am a bit mystified by the selection of songs for this concert.What keeps me from giving it five stars is this: The video director is apparently on speed. He won't let the camera rest on anything for more than a couple of seconds (except for slower songs).I saw this kind of video ""enhancement"" on Riverdance Live from New York, and it is apalling. In each case, the director seems to think that the live performance of a world-class act, riveting as it is, is not ""good enough"" and he feels a need to enhance it. The result is an eyesore--video hash of the most offensive type. I bought this DVD to see the Moody Blues, not see how fast some director can push buttons on a video switch.The Moodies themselves seem to be in good voice, the miking and lighting are spot on, and the clarity of the video is good. I just have trouble watching it...."
2,Region,Case looked good. Unable to view. I was sent the wrong Region. I am Region 2. Was sent Region 1. Not happy. I have returned DVD. Who ever sent this didn't check the address and match it to the region. Must have thought UK was part of US.
1,"Of historical interest, and that's it","The Hip before they found their voice and their sound. Musically and lyrically dull and at times disturbingly bad, especially coming from a band of this caliber. Buy any of the later albums, better yet, buy all of them before you buy this one."
4,absolutely perfect movie theater corn,"I am a huge movie buff, and will do just about anything to create that perfect theater experience at home ( hd projector, check; 180""screen, check; badass surround sound, check; plush motorized theater recliners, check check) and that goes for my popcorn too. Real movie theater popcorn can't be beat, and this stuff is the real deal. I worked at a movie theater in high school, and these packets contain all the necessary steps. The only thing missing is the butter on top, but I'm a professional chef now, so clarifying a little butter is no big deal. If you are looking for that authentic theater taste, this popcorn and a good popper are all you need. Hope this helps some of you out"
4,Tastes good and pretty convenient.,"I've tried many things to get good popcorn out of my machine and this has been the best solution. I haven't tried other brands of portion packs, but these are really good. I have tried a couple different brands of coconut oil from Amazon and a variety of popcorns, but this has been the best.I've read other reviews on this brand and agree that the salt is overkill. I usually use more salt than most people, but this is crazy salty! I just don't use it all. This popcorn is good, it pops up crispy and just has a good taste to it."
1,Disappointing,"I purchased a case of this popcorn for two reasons: the rave reviews of others on Amazon and it was a lower-priced alternative to Wabash Valley Farms Real Theater Popcorn.This is what I found:- In my opinion, Great Northern Popcorn is not as tasty as Real Theater Popcorn.- While Great Northern has a 6-ounce portion compared to Wabash Valley Farms 5.5 ounce portion it exceeded the capacity on both my Whirley Pop and Stir Crazy poppers. (Literally lifted the top off of my Stir Crazy.) So more is not necessarily better especially when you have to clean up a mess after every popping.- Quite bit more of the Great Northern Popcorn remained unpopped.- Great Northern Popcorn had a ""chewy"" texture to it."
1,Tough and Partially Pops,"I still pop packets of 6 ounce Great Northern popcorn that I purchased over one year ago that tastes like movie theater popcorn. I wanted a smaller packet, so I ordered (Nov. 4, 2012) a box of 2.5 ounce popcorn thinking the taste would be the same. I was wrong, as the popocorn does not pop well, and what does pop is tough!First, I used an electric popper with poor results, so I used my Whirley-Pop stove popper for a second batch of popcorn. The results were the same each time. Subsequent popping has produced the same results.My advice-you can either take a chance with a purchase, or buy some other brand.I hope this helps in your making a decision."
1,Salty,I had high expectations but it was extremely salty and tasted nothing like movie theater popcorn. Next time I try popping it ( I do have 23 more packs to go through) I'll try cutting back on the salt in the packet. I don't know how this popcorn got such ratings. I'll give it another shot though out of the love I have for popcorn.
5,Just like at the movies!,Our Great Northern popcorn is always a big hit at home and even more when we use it when camping. Everyone keeps coming back for more! Every batch is just as good as the last. Quick and easy.
4,Tri paks at a reasonable price,I've tried other tripaks for my 4 oz popper but keep coming back to great northern. I don't mind spending more to get better popcorn but as of yet I haven't found anything that was worth the higher price. The premeasured tri-paks are simple to use and insure a consistent quality.
5,Better than the MOVIES and Cheaper,ALL who tried this popcorn loved it and wanted more. They came back for seconds and waited in line for it. Even the parents LOVED IT!
4,Pop!,"very convenient package for my popcorn maker.The taste is good, maybe a little salty. So I took out a little of the seasoning before popping.and voila perfect."
3,Its ok but not as good as I thought it would be,"I ordered this popcorn for my 4oz machine. It is ok but not the best I have ever tasted. I was on a quest to get the taste from carnivals or even Target. This popcorn did not get it. The popcorn is not bad, does leave several unpopped kernels, but it could be a whole lot better!"
5,Great Product/Fast Shipping,"I've ordered this product several times now, both for our work popcorn popper and the one we have at home. Very satisfied with the product, the cost, and the fast shipping."
5,Great Machine and popcorn,I got an 8ounce kettle popper and combo popcorn packets and have used them almost every night. The popcorn tastes great and the packets make it super easy.
5,Popping good,I am on the auto distribution for this product so just as my popcorn drawer gets close to being empty another case arrives. The flavor is great and I only wish I could get extra seasoning powder exactly like what comes in the pack for the old maids that I collect and re-pop every so often.
3,Packaging issue,"Our theater uses this popcorn and loves it. However, in a recent shipment, one of the packets had burst, in the oil segment of course. This rendered the whole boxload a rather greasy mess."
2,makes it easier - but too much salt,"It makes it easier to use my 8oz popper( Gold Medal 2408) But its too SALTY. The Gold Medal Seasoning Flavacol is much better. I will not get again. I have adjusted by not cutting the salt portion then adding the Gold Medal Seasoning by hand that Works better. also others have talked about old maid. that comes from the Popper design. I also had issues with those Cheaper poppers & 4oz. poppers -That's why we upgraded to the professional Brand, Gold Medal, you will pay a tad bit more, but its worth it because parts can be replaced & fixed easily + it can pop ALL day with out issues + better product (popcorn)"
1,Popcorn tastes like cardboard,"I ordered this popcorn based on the glowing reviews. It's possible that I received popcorn with an expired date but have no way of telling from the packaging. Food is not allowed to be returned to Amazon so I am stuck with over 20 bags of corn kernels that are inedible. Followed the directions exactly and popped the corn in my new popper, making sure not to over cook. Popcorn came out stale tasting with card board consistency. It was dry and just awful. My first and last time ordering this."
4,Great Popcorn!,"We bought this popcorn to go with a machine we had purchased, and the machine ended up not working. So we took these portion packs of popcorn and used them on the stove top. They worked great, everyone said it was good popcorn. Would definitely buy this again, even if you just do it on the stove top, it's so easy having everything bundled into one package and ready to use!"
5,Juuuuust Right,"Just the right amount of oil, just the right amount of salt. When it comes to convenience, you will simply NOT be able to beat this Pack!"
4,Great popcorn!,You won't go wrong with this popcorn. It taste great and you have everything you need. If you like your popcorn a little on the salty side I would suggest also including some popcorn & nut salt. It's perfect on the popcorn and french fries. I'm on my second case of this popcorn and it's as good as my first case. A++
3,It's ok.,"Since it is from the same maker as the popcorn popper it is the right, amount, and convenient, but mostly it's just salty."
2,GREAT NORTHERN POPCORN,TOO HTOO HULLY AND THE BAG IS TO LARGE FOR THE POPPING MACHINE THAT I BROUGHT.I AM THINKING ABOUT RETURNING IT
1,Stale Popcorn,"We are disappointed with the Great Northern popcorn for our new machine.It seems stale.....and 'chewy'.We have a popcorn machine up north and it pops beautifully and tastes like theater popcorn.However, the popcorn we have just received seems old. We're very disappointed....and wind up not making popcorn very often."
3,"Ok, but far too salty","the packs are definitely not that easy to use, big and bulky, they could have cut it down A LOT and been just fine.the popcorn is GOOD, good quality. most of the kernels pop and are very tasty. the oil is ok, not quite theater quality, but not bad, the salt, however, is a different story all together. i does not taste good, NOT good at all. if you use the whole portion it is FAR too salty, and definitely does not taste like theater popcorn, in fact the first batch i made i was so disappointed i thought i should have just kept buying microwaveable.however I've been playing and experimenting, as i don't ant to waste a whole $25. i definitely like using all of the kernals and oil, and about 3/4th of the salt, it seems pretty good this way.i will buy a different brand next time, or just buy a whole box of salt directly from the theater and substitute that salt for this, however it is convenient and not too bad after you figure out the perfect recipe for you and your family."
5,great popcorn,"this is the best popcorn i have ever eaten, much better then the Ricos brand I was getting at sams club, thanks"
5,Easy way to make popcorn,"About a year ago, I purchased a 6 oz popcorn machine for my business in order to give my customers some free snacks while they are in my store. I purchased these 6 oz popcorn packs and love them. I do not have to worry about portions or measuring. Everything comes in a handy serving pack with the correct mixture. Super easy! No mess either. I love it! The popcorn is delicious and I have to sometimes keep myself from eating it all."
3,It aint so great...but it aint so bad!,"Look...every review I have read of this movie bags it. I bought it because I bought the Bacharach soundtrack and the music is fab. This film wasnt released in Australia and having read so many bad reviews I had to buy it and see for myself.I liked it. Its not an epic, its a bit dizzy, a bit syrupy, a bit camp and there arent any special effects or car chases...but it was NICE. Just nice. Great actors, good sets and cinematography. The script is weak but makes its point and for those who know anything about or have an interest in Miss Sussann a worthwhile look."
5,EXCELLENT,"Cupid's Secret is a wonderful book. It is filled with incredible emotion. I will read it again,recommend it and give it as gift's. Everyone needs to read this one no matter how old you are. You will never forget Cupid."
4,"Entertaining continuing fantasy romance about son of ""Forest Lord""","""Lord Of The Beasts (The Fane, Book 2)"" surprised me. I very much enjoyed this engaging fairy-tale romance. It is very well written, imaginative, and entertaining to read. The romance is slow to start at first, but begins to build up and pays off very nicely with a very solid and satisfying ending. This is a good fast-paced paranormal romance read.This story is good as a stand alone, but I must advise that it will be a much more enjoyable read if read in order with the others in this series. This book goes on my keeper shelf right next to the other three in the series. Recommended and a keeper. Enjoy!The ""Fane"" series are in order ~1. The Forest Lord ~ 5 Stars2. Lord Of The Beasts ~ 4 Stars3. Lord Of Legends ~ 4 Stars4. Lord Of Sin ~ 5 StarsGrade: B"
1,Dull and boring!,"I read the first part of the Fane series, 'The Forest Lord' and thought it was interesting though I am not sure if I am a fan of Susan Krinard's writing. But the 'Lord of the Beasts' is really boring, meaningless, and pointless. I had to go through 200 pages of convoluted writing before finding semblance of a plot. And guess what? after that I couldn't care less. The main characters are uninteresting and lack appeal. Not worth your time or money."
1,A Work of an ignorant conductor - Bad continuo choice,"Harpsichord should be replaced with a organ and one or more theorbo. It is highly in doubt that Henry Purcell ever used 8'/4' choired type harpsichord to support continuo part for his trumpet composition. There are indeed Virginal (small & relatively inexpensive version of harpsichord) but these loud type harpsichords here were non existent throughout the époque of Sir William Byrd, Sir John Dowland, Sir John Blow, Sir Edward Stafford, Henry Purcell and his two brothers Sir.Thomas and Sir.Daniel Purcell, all held a royal positions in France, Denmark and England one or more times in their lives. I Suggest that the conductor resign from his post and should give up all harpsichord parts and get advises from Sir John Elliott Gardiner, William Christie, David Taylor, Konrad Junghanell and like to redo the work of Purcell. Those true gentlemen have great deal of knowledgeabout Purcell's work."
4,"Geeze, where did these things learn their Kung Fu?","The cables are nice and an incredible value for the money. My only complaint is the grip of death they put onto the input and output terminals. It is very difficult to get the RCA ends onto the jacks and getting them off is like pulling the tooth from an angry tiger. A tight fit is good, this borders on ridiculous."
1,"Marker was very light, felt tip collapsed into the pen.","This product has poor quality. I recommend avoiding. The felt tip collapsed into the marker, the ink is weak. It's not a sharpie."
1,Light markers with low contrast,"I have tried a few sets of these markers from different retailers and the results have been consistently poor. They mark lightly, about half the contrast one would expect, like water colors."
5,great tub!,This is a great tub for any baby able to sit up on their own. It is the perfect size with room for your little one to grow. It not only saves on water you would use to fill a larger tub but gives your little one a sense of security. When i tried our baby in the big tub he cried and didnt like it so i tried him back in his infant tub and he was fine. I realized it was a matter of security for him. The large tub was just so over-whelming. He loves to squeek the duck and play with tossing rings. Price is just right to! Just be careful when you inflate tub because it inflates in sections. My husband used an air compressor thinking it was all one compartment to fill with air and it blew up!
5,great tub!,my seven month old loves this tub! He has a lot of room (& he is 21 pounds!) I also use this to put him on the floor when I'm showering so he can play with toys and be contained. I highly recommend!
3,Beware,"This will not fit most of the tools. This is a very small pouch, so unless you bought a standard/entry level tool then this will be useless to you."
4,MS Streets & Trips Will Get You There,"The nice lady tells you where to go (like nice ladies everywhere). The GPS is the lowest price GPS anywhere. Plug it into your computer, put in your destination, follow the lady. Couldn't be easier or simpler. Nothing fancy, it just works and works well."
2,glitches all over,"Program freezes/crashes. Inaccurate location at places that are not very common like in the country. It's accurate in cities but do watch out for high building b/c this thing need a good signal for the GPS. Last time I used this, I feel like using a beta version."
4,Very good inexpensive GPS software,"If you have a laptop and are travelling with at least one other person, this is a pretty good piece of software. It is difficult to use when driving by myself. Also, for some reason, even though I am in California, it wants to locate me in Chicago or Phoenix, so I have to reset it. For the price it has been pretty useful."
4,Great GPS for the Money!,I'm a corporate trainer and travel alot in unfamiliar territory and MS Street and Trips gets to my destination all the time.
4,Streets and Trips a real Bonanza,"On a recent vacation I utilized all of the capabilities of this product and was plesantly surprised. The GPS function performed flawlessly and the various functions worked very well. Since I had a laptop, this program saved me the purchase of a much more costly unique GPS driving product. This product was only $80 compared to nearly $350 for the closest GPS unit like TOm Tom or Garman. It does all the things that the higher cost products do and gives me the added benefit of the larger laptop display. My only downside is the road constuction update from the web was far from accurate. Many road projects that had obviously been underway for some time but were not in the database download."
1,"This should be ""Microsoft streets and trips without gps locator""","There is no locator, But good to know its in the fine print at the bottom of the listing. This information should be at the top you would think. Starting to like ebay more and more least the seller can post and photo what they are selling amazon gets crazy with the ""use an (amazon) stock photo"" thing its misleading to the buyer."
3,I prefer DeLorme.,"I have been using DeLorme for the past year. I travel via car from Florida to Maine to Minnesota to Texas, so I give it a pretty good workout. I bought the Streets & Trips to try out and/or give to a co-worker. I installed the software and immediately realized that I couldn't store an address book. One of my complaints about DeLorme is that I can only store 200 addresses. I like to save my office, home, customers, restaurants, and hotels, so the lack of an address book is a deal breaker for me. One other item I noticed is that when you search for a location of interest like restaurants, DeLorme returns about 50 times the number that Microsoft did. I did like the GPS antenna."
2,Headphones ovepriced,"Like always, Amazon service and partners are outstanding. The headphones themselves are bulky for portability although it provides average sound clarity. Like many noise cancellation headphones, at certain frequency a buzzing sound would occur. The positive is the cups are very comfortable."
2,Don;t think it works,I get motion sick in the car all the time - so I got those hoping it would be a good solution.They are VERY tight and you cannot easily put them on.And they didn't help me at all.
2,not good for PS3,"I got this cable a few months ago to use with my PS3. While things seemed fine at first, after playing a game or blu-ray disc for awhile, the audio tends to completely cut out and is replaced by an ultra loud blast of static white noise. This seems to happen completely at random, but I do think it tends to happen after playing a disc for a moderate duration of time. Nonetheless, it is a very ill-desired side effect, especially for a high def system, and I would highly recommend stepping up a little and getting something with a better brand name. I know people say ""all HDMI cables are the same"", but this thing has taught me they are truly not.From the start, I have also noticed that my PS3 outputs a lower volume than every other component hooked up to my receiver, and I'm starting to wonder if this cable is responsible for that as well. Bottom line - stay away from this thing."
1,Not good,"The author demonstrated lack of understanding of the topics covered, and no hands-on experience."
4,easy to use,"This is very easy to use. The previous one saved our appliances and electronics when a power line fell behind our house. The surge protectors all ""bit it"" but they protected the appliances just as they should!"
2,Average,"Take away half of this book, maybe a little more and, you would have a good book. I only cared to hear about the kidnapping. I only needed to know very little about Stanley. Stanley's childhood friends or his child hood was of little interest or concern to me. Hearing about his family or Father mattered very little. The book is about a kidnapping that happened and not enough really happened to create this book. Extremely slow and boring."
2,Cliches Galore!,"This was a fun sort of read, much like eating popcorn. You know there is no nutrition it but something about the crunch satisfies.Sadly our writer needed a better editor. The writer's urge to rely on chestnuts was rarely denied. It became something of a sport, however, to see how many pages Mr. Alpert could type before he gave into another worn cliche. That combined with his strange ""hero-worship"" of himself made what might of been a good story probably more self-revealing than this author intended."
3,Maryland Mom,"I found the Birthday Party to be a very entertaining book, although the other reviewers are correct in their assertions that the author is full of himself. He is, but the experience that he describes is riveting. One thing that really stuck with me from this book is how the author talks about his belief that the death penalty is wrong. However, in the story it turns out that the biggest reason why he wasn't killed was the criminals' belief that if they killed government attorney they would be more likely to get the death penalty. Can we all get business cards with our profession listed as Federal Prosecutor so our chances of being murdered by the criminal element will drop to Stanley's?"
5,The Birthday Party - a must read,"I could not put this book down until I found out how Alpert lived to tell his tale. He cleverly reflects back on his life while describing the duration of his kidnapping; you can't help feeling connected. Alpert has a way of telling a frightening story so pragmatically there were times I found myself laughing out loud. I've often wondered what I would do in a kidnapping situation; Alpert not only lived to tell it, but he remembered every detail."
2,borrow it,"others have used the words ""annoyingly arrogant and apparently editor-less man"" and i totally agree. how insecure must he be to continually bring up his wannabe dating habits? and if i was that lisa woman, i'd be pissed that he continually kept writing her full name, including middle initial. jerk. borrow this book from the library."
4,"Compared to what's out there, this is the best.","Mr. Meylani has outdone all of those well known prep companies. I am a student who jumped Precalc, going to Calculus straight, so I truly needed to get my concepts straight. Mr. Meylani's book gives EVERYTHING along with a clear indication of what is IIC material or not. I took the test yesterday and feel very confident. This was a test I was rather nervous of, due to my lacking precalc experience, but no worries if you want something with ALL the answers, your search ends here. My only complaint is that there are few errors. However, this is no stigma almost, as there is no book that's close to as complete as this one. So, at least compared to what's out there, this is the best."
1,Complete Prep For The SAT Math Subject Tests Level 1 and Level 2,"This book isn't worth the recycled paper it is written on! I bought it for my son's SAT Math Subject Test and we found numerous errors, missing tests, wrong answers, duplicate pages, and several printing errors. I can go on, but I hope by now you realize this book will only make a confusing subject even more confusing. If you want to pass the SAT Math Test Level 1 or 2 then DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK! It will take you longer to decipher this book than taking a 10 week course. I am very disappointed in Amazon for recommending and even selling it. This is one book I would enjoy burning, as I was in buying it!"
2,tedious.,"the other reviews of this Civil War video were so exhaulted, i was truly looking forward to a new slant on america's history. it was painfully slow and after spending 2 hours, i can say pointless."
4,Realities of War,"The movie brought out the realities of the Civil War. Most of the War was not spent in large battles but in camps and down time doing such things as foraging for food for the soldiers and their animals. This movie portrays one of the millions of behind the scenes stories that could have occured during the War. The movie is well done and ends sadly as the characters end up hating each other over their differences even though there were moments of common ground gained during the time they spent together. As a Civil War reenactor and someone with ancestors who fought in the war, I always appreciate when a Civil War themed movie is made."
4,Once in a lifetime pairing,"This TV special brings together the two most famous ""Dolly Levis"" - Carol and Pearl. What an inspired idea! A unique and wonderful experience."
3,"Carol, Yes. Pearl, No.","I'm sure it sounded like a great idea. Carol and Pearl at the peaks of their respective careers. And Carol is definitely a delight. Today she's become the unfortunate butt of jokes, but here you can see why she was a star. Tremendous stage presence and impeccable timing. Pearl, on the other hand, is very hard to watch. She obviously doesn't want to be there, and holds her co-star and the audience in obvious contempt. You can, however, see glimpses of why she, too, was a star. She has an innate tendency to play around with the material, but here it doesn't work, and she comes off snide and dismissive. But diehard Channing fans will probably want to own this."
3,Not happy,I received my headset in plastic bubble wrap without the listed items from the product features section. I use the headset during my commute. I really need a case for it. The headphones are very bulky and heavy. Another reason to have a case for them. I contacted Amazon and was assured that I would receive another shipment of the correct items. They sent the same exact thing! This morning I see that I missed the review that says **ALL PARTS LISTED ARE NOT INCLUDED** (Darn it)I am very disappointed with this whole experience and both are now going back. I will keep researching.
2,"Good with cable, fuzzy with bluetooth","I have been using it for a week.It is good when it goes with cable. But while you're using bluetooth listen to music, you hear some noise like hissing in high pitch. I am not ok with that, It is noticeable and disgusting. If you're going to buy it you have to think about if you are ok with that.I don't know why some people would say it sounds good !!!But I can tell you it's not as good as they said. It just ok when it goes with cable.Pros:Easy to use, very easyLong battery lifeSounds ok with cableComfortable(If you don't mind a little bit heat)Good qualitycons:Sounds not good and kinda fuzzy with bluetoothI wish its sound was as good as its look. It has lot of pros that I am satisfied, but the sound is bad enough to make me return it. If you are buying it to listen to music, not this one."
1,Motorola S805 driver (lack),"Pro's: A nice looking set of headphones for the price. Shop around, you'll find prices anywhere from $149 on Wireless Underground to $29.Con's: It would be nice if Motorola supported these with software. My Vista system can't pair with them without a driver and the bluetooth drivers resident within Vista don't work. So they are worthless unless you can find a working driver. I have read that the Blue Soleil driver (priced at $20 on line) will make them work.Overall: Motorola out to be drummed out of business for selling a product without the software required to make it work ....or at least have it available for free on their web site --- which they do not at this time (11/24/09)"
1,"Great Concept, Lousy Execution","Suggest you wait for some positive reviews before buying. Mine arrived DOA and missing an important accessory listed on the box - the 2.5 mm to 3.5 mm adapter cable. Not to mention the Bluetooth Stereo Gateway which ANTOnline didn't bother to ship. Huh? Motorola product support, while well intentioned, is a sad joke. Nobody knows anything about this product and, as a result, they sent me an HS805 as a replacement. Why bother?"
4,"Nice sound for the price, but a little bulky","I'm probably not adding anything new, but I'll state my opinion anyway. These headphones have great sound and block out ambient sounds very well. I don't like ear buds, so the over the ear design is great for me, but this of course means the headset is pretty big and bulky. It doesn't fold up very small either, the ear cups just rotate so that they can lay flat. I love pairing these headphones with my smartphone (Moto Q9c) to listen to streaming radio or mp3s. The Bluetooth works great; it's reliable, easy to pair, and sounds great. The built in mic isn't high quality, but it's decent enough for when someone interrupts your jam session by actually calling you on your phone (the nerve of some people)."
2,Looks good but has some serious issues,I had high hopes for this headphone.I needed a cord less one for travel on trains (boh undergraound and above).Since it is a closed one I thought that noise isolation would be good. But actaully it is horrible. I could not listen anything while underground.It also causes ear pain and clamps around you head.My previous headphone was the Bose quite comfort 2. Since it broke I bought this wishing to avoid the wires.I may have to get another pair of bose headphone.
1,"""Retro"" Product with Rudimentary User Experience","I was biased by the form factor of the headset thinking that Motorola had designed a robust product delivering the needs of a wireless Bluetooth headset. However, this product disappoints and lacks intuitive, easy-to-use and painless useless experience (wake up Motorola, it is 2009).My review from the functional point of view:Pros:1. Good audio quality when used as headphones (both Bluetooth and wired)2. Good battery lifeCons:1. Terrible microphone reception (very important)2. Lack of power indicator: On/Off/Stand-by3. Difficult to turn on: It takes around 5 seconds and sometimes have to try again.4. No auto-paring. Have to enter code again and again (really annoying)5. Extremely bulkyI don't know if the ""retro"" is back in style but this product is definitely stuck in the 80's from the product functionality standpoint."
2,Where's the box?,I received this item in red bubble wrap that had a made in china sticker on it. I don't know what happened box. It looked very unprofessional and the Amazon.com box looked like it was taped together by someone that didn't care. I can hear static while music is playing and other people can hear my music playing on low. I 'm not even sure this is the correct headset without the box.
2,S805 doesn't work as expected,"This bluetooth headset does not parent with the white imac (early 2007) correctly and the performance is kind of bad..... there's to much noise with the signal, I don't know if this is because of the computer or there's something else I am doing wrong..... this problem remains on my new HP dv51010 and it's so disappointing that I have them stored in the original package in my house...I keep using my old cordless Sony infra-red headset.Nolbrigo"
5,"True to Life, just too funny!","I can't tell you how much I enjoyed this book.She's done an excellent job portraying the life of a military wife, with all its ups and downs, in a way that can't help but make you laugh. She mentioned so many things I miss about being surrounded by military in the ""fishbowl"" of a military community. Every story reminded me of my own experience--the ""raisin on the butt, the hairstylist, the chickpea and okra quiche."" They were all too funny because they are so real. Thanks for writing this so I could always be reminded of such treasured memories."
3,Don't do it !,"I don't know how the DVDs are - they are a Christmas present and haven't been viewed yet. Soooooo.... don't send me an email saying, ""Recently purchased 'Everybody Loves Raymond'"" and spoil the surprise by letting my wife see THAT ! OK ?"
5,Great Product,I am really enjoying the Everybody Loves Raymond Complete series. It is a great product and well worth having.
1,Never received what I ordered,"Worst service ever! I never got what I ordered, and I never received a response to the emails I sent them. Don't buy anything from them."
2,Buyer Beware,If you buy the $125 version of this you get what you pay for. Most of season 3 through 6 had bad pressings (.ie they were unplayable). I'd say about a little more than half the episodes were playable. Almost all of the extra stuff was playable. That helped.
5,Classic comedy,Ray Romano and cast will always be fun to watch. Many hours of laughter will result from watching this wonderful classic series. I recommend this to everyone who loves comedy. Nicely put together in this package.
3,Bad Quality,This version is very poor quality. Couple of the shows dont play and the DVDs stick. the 10th season is not even a DVD its the script. So dont waste your time with this.
2,Schtick for the sake of schtick,"Alright, Ken... you've done some wonderful work over the years and you really are feeling the need to be experimental and artsy and edgy. That's fine, but next time LEAVE IN the text. Particularly, don't substitute what W.S. writes with song and dance numbers only slightly related to the theme."
5,Nice treatment of the Baird.,"Set in a european neverland with a kind of drifting and pleasent lifestyle the film mirrors the original text and Europe in the 1930's with equal astuteness. The feeling of the 30's is mirrorred further by the use of classic 30's music and Hollywood musical styles, the sets have a flavour of Astaire and Rogers; as do the costumes and choreography.A worthy little film with a lively, engaging and romantic cast.To me it demonstrates Branagh is better behind the lens than infront of it."
2,Branaugh Sucks,"Branaugh is too old to play Berowne, Silverstone too poor an actress for the Princess, and Nathan Lane's Costard is not a large enough part to make this movie any better."
1,Definitely labored and definitely lost.,"Of all the adaptations of Shakespeare's plays for the screen, this is among the very worst. After Branagh's glorious Much Ado About Nothing, one might expect a similar treatment for this comedy. Unfortunately, this was not so. Why bother making a musical with actors and actresses who can neither sing nor dance? Maybe this could be forgiven if the acting weren't, at best, merely adequate."
3,"Detection part a bit lacking, but story is still very good","Very much enjoying this series. I didn't find the mystery of this one as engaging as the others until the very end. I was sure I figured out the whodunnit for once in this series. But no. I still didn't figure it out. And the solution was elegantly simple. I think I was a bit disappointed in the actual detecting part of the story because most of what they learned was through various visits and conversations with people who were remarkably forthcoming. And a major bit of information comes, fortuitously, from Will's brother Harry. It seemed a little to convenient and perfect. But overall I still enjoyed the story.The silent longing between Nell and Will is wonderful without being exasperating. As with the other books, the story actually ends on a personal note b/t Nell and Will that makes you sigh"
5,Awesome Luggage,"This is great luggage. We travel alot with my husbands job so I originally bought a 3 piece set in the Chocolate Bubbles. It packs so well and stood up so nicely on the plane that my husband order himself this 19 in. for a carry on. He doesn't know it but will probably get a bigger one for checking for Christmas. I even saw one of mine sitting on the airline field waiting to be loaded sitting in a puddle of water. I just knew it would be filthy and everything inside soaked, but you couldn't even tell it had gotten wet at all. I highly recommed this luggage for anyone and best of all??? ""THE PRICE!"" You can't beat the price!!Signed,B"
1,Whack 'em with a spoon???,"Yikes! This author is into child abuse, recommending beating little kids with objects. Dangerous advice, unless you're in the mood to get arrested. Try directing your anger on a pillow or punching bag instead. It's a lot safer than beating up your child. Try accepting normal child behavior and keep your cool."
2,Hole in shirt,"We received everything as promised and in time for Christmas. However, after opening gifts and washing clothes before wearing them for the first time, we noticed a big hole under the collar in front. Of course, all receipts had been tossed by then. Please check all aspects of a purchase before throwing receipts away. We knew it but didn't check close enough."
4,no surface ships?,"No mention made of surface ship, Aircraft Carrier CV, nor Heavy Cruiser CA operations. Also does not mention USAF deployment......Lots of 'talking head' coverage. Excellent coverage of Regulus submarine systems deployment.........."
2,Not too good,"Hohner should be ashamed to put their name on this Chinese-made accordion. No, wait, they don't. Lucky thing, for it would bring shame on that fine old name. I bought one of these several months ago and I've had several reeds go bad. Now I'm going to have to waste my time fixing the thing, if I can. It's sure not worth paying a pro to fix it. Even when it all works, it doesn't work very well. The action is slow and unresponsive. Save your money until you can afford a German-made Hohner."
1,Hohner 3002N,"I came away very dissatisfied with this instrument. Besides giving me the Bronx Cheer on button #7 (never knew that was even in the diatonic scale), I found it hard to play due to stiff bellows, sticky keys, air hungry, and sluggish response and too much play in the button assembly to allow covers to seat properly. You get notes when you don't want them. Also came with nicks, dings, scratches and peeling paint on the note covers. If you want a quality Cajun Accordion buy the ones made in Louisiana, U.S.A. A toy is better than this. Save you money and buy something better."
4,Blocks portion of second outlet,"Although pretty compact, it is a bit too tall, and as a result blocks enough of the second outlet of a duplex receptacle to prevent that outlet from being used. Only a very slim plug would be able to squeeze by the Spikecube and use the second outlet. Too bad."
5,A great concert by legendary duo,"This DVD captures a slice of rock history - the story of Jan & Dean. These guys were blazing trails that others had only dreamed of. Jan arranged and produced the group's records, which sparked Brian Wilson to do the same with the Beach Boys. They were in line for their own television show (a pilot had been shot) and were forming their own record label when Jan ran his Corvette into the back of a parked truck. The first EMTs to arrive thought he was dead. He survived and through hard work and determination returned to the stage. This DVD captures that phase of their career. Sure, they were a little rough, but that is the beauty of it. The man persevered and didn't let his limitations stop him. Jan Berry was an inspiration and Dean Torrence helped him complete the comeback. Sadly, Jan has passed away, but we have this DVD as a testament to his talent and remarkable resilience. Now, they should be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame!!"
2,Put's the Low in Low budget production,"Although it was fun to see Jan & Dean do a live concert, they could of at least spent just a little bit of money on the production. From the look of it, they probably had one of the wives hold up a camcorder during the performance. That's it. Very amateur looking. The sound also was pretty mediocre.Another warning, this concert is from the early 80's not 2000, and it really shows. But hey, it's an oldies but goody I guess. I grew up by the beach in the 60's, owned a vette, surfed, and hung out at Huntington Beach pier, so it was cool to hear the old songs. If you grew up in Cali, this will no doubt bring back memories of 63 chevs, Huntingon Pier, KRLA, The Whisky, Ludes, and pch.Be stoked, but don't hang out at dead man's curve. Cause you don't come back from the curve.aloha,donnie"
3,Interesting,A combo of four short movies. My advice is watch the interview with the film maker before watching the shorts. Otherwise these will make no sense at all. I always feel any gay themed movie is worth watching at least once. But once was really enough.
4,This Movie Needs To Be Viewed More Than Once!,"Neil Young's guitar. A movie shot in black and white. Cameo's by Billy Bob Thorton and Iggy Pop. Robert Mitchum as the grizzled owner of the Metal Works in Machine, Texas. I sat and watched. Neither my wife or myself said a word. It was spellbinding. A western and more. Johnny Depp is in fine form. Give this movie a chance, you won't be disappointed."
4,Hee hee!,"What a joy! Every now and again I feel that it is a good thing to see a film that COMPLETLEY bends your head. I was confused from the very first scene. But even for someone who is about as arty as a toe nail this film is hypnotic and enjoyable. I reccomend that anyone see it and if you want my advice, don't try to understand it! PS Neil rocks"
5,"A Lovely, Mysterious, Beautifully Filmed Masterpiece","Jim Jarmusch's DEAD MAN is one of the few film allegories that actually works. It's a completely individualized, eccentric piece of filmmaking that, considering the oddities populated throughout its narrative, never succumbs to self-appreciative banality. The tale itself takes one interesting turn after another, and it progresses at its own deliberate pace, but wonderfully so; nothing is rushed here, while, at the same time, nothing seems overprepared or fussed over, either -- it's a fluid, unified vision that has a quietly hypnotic effect. The brilliant German cinematographer Robby Muller gets the best use of B/W since Woody Allen blessed us with 1985's THE PURPLE ROSE OF CAIRO; the images are inhumanly lucid and clear, with an outstanding and imaginative production design and piercing music score perfectly complimenting them. Both Johnny Depp and Gary Farmer (as Nobody) are superb."
2,I disagree,"I'm really surprised by the number of people who love this movie. It does have a great cast and it starts very well. However, it's all downhill from the point that accountant turned fugitive William Blake goes on the run. From then on, we're treated to a never-ending string of pretentious scenes in which the various characters wander through the wilderness, spouting pop philosophy between killings. Suddenly, it ends. Nothing is resolved. Perhaps the point of the film is that there is no point. If so, it succeeds admirably."
