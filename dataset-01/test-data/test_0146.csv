5,Inspirational and Life-Changing,"This book, by no doubt, changed my life. John Wooden helps the readers search themselves to find inner source of leadership, responsibility, and success. He not only calls on the readers to change how they look at themselves, but also how they interact with others. Wooden's Pyramid of Success truly is made up of building blocks for a better life. Jay Carty takes expands on the philosophy by illuminating biblical context of each building block that helps the reader build on a more spiritual relationship with God. A fantastic read that will change your outlook on the world and on yourself!"
4,The original retro swing,"A wonderful set of classic jazz from two players who reintroduced the world to the virtues of 1930's/40's era swing playing - Scott Hamilton and Warren Vache. There is a great selection of classic tunes ( Tea for Two, You're Getting to Be A Habit With Me ) along with some originals based on standards of the period ( Freego, Raus! ). I especially like the Hamilton ballad intro to ""Tea for Two "" and ""Danny Boy"" - breathy, beefy playing in the tradition of Ben Webster. The two vocals by Sue Melikian are OK but not overly impressive...buy this for the great playing by the hornmen and band. This is the real ""retro swing"" - Vache and Hamilton took up the repertoire championed by Ruby Braff and brought it to a new generation, myself included. It inspires my efforts to this day."
1,SCARY!,"I have two cats, and was recommended this product as an addition to Frontline topical. After mixing the liquid into food and feeding it to both cats, shortly thereafter, one of them lost the use of his hind legs. It was one of the scariest moments of my life, and I rushed him to the emergency vet. Fortunately, by the time I got him in to see the doctor, he was fine. The next day, I spoke with his regular doctor and was told to watch for seizures, as the incident may have been coincidental, yet it's been almost a year and he's had no other problems."
1,Not HDMI 1.3,Not an HDMI 1.3 cable. Not compatible with newer televisions and cable boxes for trasmitting audio. Video quality is still great though.
1,What a letdown...,"The introduction of the book leads one to think that this will be a good clinical book on the topic of Narcissistic Personality Disorder and its effect on the children of narcissists. That is, until you get to Chapter 3 and realize that the book is about the author's own ""unfair"" life and the lives of her friends. The objectivity of the author is zilch because she is personally invested in her own story and its presentation. She also seems to judge her friends (""so sad that they can't stop the narcissistic pattern""). This is literally the first book that I have ever thrown away! I agree with other readers who felt that the author's own narcissism is showcased in this book."
1,self-indulgent self-analysis with metaphors run amok,"I sympathize with the author, who has serious issues of her own to address, but I felt as though I should be paid to be her analyst by reading this book. I was drawn by the case studies, which I thought would provide personalized accounts of this serious issue; instead, I found each case study slanted to illuminate the author's own problems. I got more insight reading the book jacket blurb (which summarizes typical narcissistic behaviors) than I did plowing through the text itself.... In her valiant attempt to garner sympathy, the author has not left a single metaphoric stone unturned. When she most needs to be clear and concise, she inter-weaves images until they make no sense at all."
2,Trapped in the Mirror,"This book was informative and shed a lot of (very disturbing) light on what it is like to be raised by a narcissistic parent. I could relate to the plights of many of the people that Elan interviewed. The one BIG distracting factor of the book, however, was that it seems that no one did any editing. The voice jumped from first person to third person and back again. The tone of the book flip flopped around from clinical explanations to personal accounts to some sort of fantasy fairytale style that I could not follow at all. For this reason, I had to read many passages a couple times just to try and decipher what Elan was really trying to say. All in all it was informational but very painful to read."
3,Trapped in the Mirror,I thought the book would be more of a self help book.The book spent a lot of time talking about differentpeoples stories and went on way too long.
3,"Old but, It Will Do.","This book should be read by those struggling with the after effects of having been raised by narcissistic or controlling parents; but it should also be read with scrutiny if read alone without previous, or further research on the topic of narcissism. One should also keep in mind the more current school of modern psychology while reading this work, as some of the matter is dated, and certainly written to the author's own conclusions."
2,The Blind Leading the Blind,"The idea that this author is in any way justified in writing a book on healing or conquering narcissism is laughable. The book is filled with countless examples of her own insanity--like the time she cracked her skull and insisted on seeing an Eastern meditative healer instead of a doctor. Of course, her parents intervention was proof of their narcissism.This is a fascinating topic but an awful book. Most of the anecdotes come from group therapy that she ATTENDED instead of led. The book bills itself as an authoritative work on a topic that the author just happens to have a bit of personal experience in. Really, it's a rant, a cathartic work aimed at healing HER wounds and not THE wounds. I think there is a massive conflict on interest in writing about a problem that personally affected everyday of her childhood. Each time she describes narcissistic qualities you can tell she is projected the qualities of her parents. Pass."
1,Cannot recommend,I was so disgusted by the author's blatant hatred of her parents that it immediately turned me off. I can only agree with the other negative reviews. There are a few good insights but don't waste any money on this book!
5,All you need to know for a home that creates more good fortu,"Does the way you arrange your home create more good fortunef? According to Jane Alexander it does! This book is packed with practical advice on how to arrange your home according to the principles behind feng sui principles. Neither overbearing or boring, Jane's tips are equally invaluable to the reader who just wants a more pleasing environment to the person who absolutely believes that good chi affects our personal tranquility."
4,JOAN'S LINGERIE PARTY!,"Crawford plays Bonnie, a spoiled socialite who refuses to marry her beau Bob Townsend (Lester Vail). Clark Gable plays the sordid Jake Luva, a bootlegger who eventually wants to take Joanie ""for a ride""...This film is famous for the lingerie party aboard the Vail's yacht where both the men and ladies are seen drinking and carrying on in their undergarments: hot stuff for 1931 audiences! Gable's characterisation of Luva was considered a vivid and authentic bit of acting in its day and although Crawford's acting was still a bit self-conscious, she managed to prove herself an actress of no little dramatic ability. Crawford breathed some life into her role and picture is swiftly moving with thrills along the way. As Joan's weak little drinking brother, William Bakewell did an admirable job."
4,dancing lady,"Besides a few bit/uncredited parts in some silents, this is Clark Gable's first feature film production with Joan Crawford. Clark Gable plays the role of Jake Luva and Joan is Bonnie Jordan, a young girl who has to go to work after the stock market leaves her family penniless. This is one of those rare pre-code films that include risque dialog and themes. The film even includes a brief featurette with intro by Leonard Maltin, saying that Joan was ""nobody's victim."" That's for certain. In this picture she goes from victim to victor, yet that road she traveled wasn't easy and wasn't smooth. There were many sparks that Joan and Clark Gable set off together in this film which made it memorable. I also love how youthful and young Clark Gable looks without his signature mustache. ""Dance, Fools, Dance"" is certainly a keeper that belongs in the collection of any Joan Crawford fan.The movie is 80 mins./black and white/produced by MGM and was released in 1931."
3,Something is missing in this translation,"I have several books of Nikolai Gogol that I enjoy reading over and over again, but this translation, in my opinion, doesn't sound like Gogol at all. Maybe my books are old and translated with a different style."
5,My two daughters loved it,"My two daughters, 2 and 4 years old, loved this DVD. We already had Prima Princessa's Swan Lake and Nutcracker, and this one was great too. It inspired both of them to don a tutu and dance around the living room. Even though the little one is too young to really understand the dance steps, she still has fun with it. It's such a good price, and would make a nice gift or rainy day/playdate activity. There are even craft ideas at the end, which could spark a fun project when it's over."
2,short changed,"The reason I brought the CD was to here my favorite song, Wildflower and it was cut short, so now I have look to see if you have the whole song and purchase it Thank you Cynthia McCullough"
5,New Birth Wildflowers - Greatest HIits,"This CD is awesome, it brought back memories of all of the things that the 70's are famous for, sax riffs, falsetto solos, the sense that life was limitless before us. I had forgotten how pure the voices of these artists were and enjoyed their old forgotten familiarity. I just had one complaint. How could their greatest hits lack the song 'It's been such a long time'????"
2,Not funny,I didn't think it was all that funny. Maybe you have to like bar stories. The Lincoln Park Trixies was the best bit.
5,Almost a greatest hits album.,"I'll be up front with everybody here and tell you that I'm not a huge fan of The Who in general, but I am absolutely into this CD. It's got all my Who favorites on it including the classic ""Won't Get Fooled Again"" which is probably my favorite FM Rock hit from the 1970's.Add to this Baba O'Riley, Bargain (a great love song if you really liten to it), Behind Blue Eyes, and Going Mobile, and you've got just about all great Who songs that were played so much by the FM Rock stations back in the 1970's. I really loved this stuff, and now this great album has been remasters and I'm listening to it on Sennheiser headphones and I'm hearing instrumental pieces I've never heard before. So in a way I'm hearing it for the first time."
1,Typical '70s junk.,"My mom made me leave the house for the first time in years or I would be grounded from World Of Warcraft for a week! Ugh! So I was taking a walk around this old junkyard and was rummaging though a pile of trash and found this album on cassette. I was excited- a new album to listen to! I put it in my Walkman from 1993 and hoped for an awesome album (hopefully as good as ""St.Anger""). What a disappointment! I hated this album! Here's why:1.) All songs sound the same2.) Do they even have a bassist? I sure as heck can't hear the bass.3.) The guitarist was awful4.) The drumming was so simple, all in 4/45.) The vocals were horrid! He sounded like a dying cat6.) The songs were generic and uncreativeAlso, they were never on MTV or BET! So that's an automatic fail. Listen to some real music like Bon Jovi, people."
1,WHO'S THE WHO??????????,"Never heard of em!!!!Someone said, buy this it good.Yeah good for wiping the dust from the floor.The singer, don't know his name, he can't sing!!!!Unlike legends like Mariah Carey, and Whitney Houston.And that first song, what is it???Oh Biba Rileo, it gives me a headache!!!!This isn't music, this is noise!!!Try listen to true musicians like...Celine Dion, Britney Spears, Linkin Park, and the one and only...............GOOD CHARLOTTEThese are the musicians of the future not this!!!!Believe me, I know!!!!I too am a musician, I play the triangle, bango, flute, and organ, I am an A ++++++++ student!!!!BELIEVE METhis and Pop Idol is the future!!!!!!!!!!!!!!P.SThe E stands for Expert!!!!!Anyone disagree?????NO!!!!!GOOD!!!!!see ya later aligator"
5,One of the best albums ever,"If you are any kind of rock music fan at all then you must have this album in your collection. This album can be considered one of the greatest rock albums ever created. It is in the same category with anything The Beatles, Led Zep, Pink Floyd or The Stones have done. The fact that this entire album is basically scrapped tracks that were to be used for another rock opera just adds to it's greatness. Townshend is basically saying, ""Here's a bunch of stuff we were working on that just didn't pan out the way I envisioned."" Boom! You have one of the greatest albums ever.Another amazing thing about this album is that it is a re-re-lease. The original was much shorter and it was still one of the greatest albums ever without the extra stuff. Then they added the extra tracks. And then they added more. Brillant!"
4,Music To Drive To,"The Who really capture the sound of the 70's and in my opinion are the next best thing to the legends - PINK FLOYD. Who's Next is a brilliant album because it is varied and packed with classics. Some with pounding bass lines, some with brilliant riffs and some with excellent relaxing accoustic sections. If you like the Who or are interested then this is the album to get. Ladies and gentlemen this album will make you want to jump, dance, scream, sing, chill out and imagine but most importantly make you enjoy music. Play it in your car and go on a long drive, you will have a lot of fun."
5,the best WHO album of all.,"along with machine head,aqualung,volume 4,and street corner talkin,sticky fingers,we can safely conclude that they belong to the class of masterpieces where not a single track in the album is boring.from baba o riley up to wont get fooled again,you are sure to experience an hours delight of listening.thanks to TRACK RECORDS for re mastering and adding bonus materials to this masterpiece of masterpiece.i am very sure that mr.TOWNSHEND will nod his approval with my observation.i have been listening to this album for 27 years, and it gets stronger every year.a millenium ahead in its time. every rock music lover must have this album."
4,Worried,"Hi,I'm a little bit worried because the CD hasn't arrived so far.I know that it's christmas time, but it should be here by now.It has happened with me before.I bought an O.C.Smith CD that was delayed for more than two months.I had to mail it back, because you sent me a second one after my complain.Can you trace the shipment?Regards,Sergio"
5,Who's Next Rocks!,"I didn't know people could be so stupid until I read some of the reviews that said that the Who ripped Behind Blue Eyes off of Limp Bizimuhwhatever because that is not true at all. In fact, Who's Next was released before any memebers of Limp Bizimuhwhatever were even born! And I don't care what anybody says, the Who Rocks and is the greatest band!"
5,Who's Best,"I've read some other reviews for this album. Many of them have a sense of unpleasantness that leaves you feeling like this is a bad album. Actually, this is a very, very good album. Pete Townshend is a brilliant songwriter, and this album highlights some of the best material he's ever come up with. He manages to capture the emotional teenage mind in a rock and roll atmosphere. ""Baba O'Riley,"" ""Behind Blue Eyes"" and ""Won't Get Fooled Again"" are pure classics. I also enjoyed ""Love Ain't for Keeping"" and ""Bargain."" For any fan of The Who or classic rock, this album is a must."
5,Deluxe Edition well worth it!!!,"Unlike a few others I've seen, I didn't have Who's Next on cd until I bought the deluxe edition. I am extremely happy that I waited. I have loved the Who's Next album for over 20 years and see great value in this edition. That includes songs that appear 2 or even 3 times. If you are a Who fanatic and see value in both Leeds and Isle of Wight Festival (as well as Charlton 74 and others if you can get ahold of them), then this if for you.Besides one of the greatest albums of all time and some outtakes, we get a CD of the Who in a casual live setting. The songs come alive with the Who in thier natural element. They were one of the most amazing live bands ever, and this shows the live energy with concise, tight renditions of songs.If the prospect of this CD does not immediately thrill you, then it might not be for you. Buy one of the several Greatest Hits collections and rent ""The Kids are Alright"". That may bring you running back for more."
5,Who's Best!,"This album should have been called Who's Best rather than Who's Next. It's not a greatest hits album but if you thought ""Tommy"" and ""Quad"" were the Who's Best, then you better listen to this one now. Don't read any more reviews, just buy it!"
5,A fitting end...,"I actually, am a HUGE fan of the .Hack manga series. When I found out that #3 was the final volume, I was a little depressed. (Just a little.) But, I decided to finish the series, and the first day I got the third book, I finished it. The conclusion was a good one, and really ended the series well. Personally, I wish it didn't have to end. Oh well.May the .Hack series rest in peace."
5,The greatest movie since Beat Street,"This movie is the Downhill Willy of rollerblade movies. Not only did I buy rollerblades I also bought oakley to be like my hero Mitch. What Rad was to BMX Airborne is to Rollerblade. Rob Bowman is the best director of this decade and this movie should be studied and mentioned in the same breath as Citizen Kane, Karate Kid 2, Air Bud, Booty Call, and The Godfather. Don't rent it, Buy it!!!"
3,I must've lost the last 20 pages.,"I have to agree that the flying scenes in this book are great. I can even get past the whole ""Tailhook"" thing, but I have a major problem with the ending.As some of the other reviewers have stated, the book just sort of peters out. There is a great build-up, likeable if slightly unbelieveable characters, and some terrific action. Then it all sort of fizzles out.I won't give away the plot of the book (others have already done that), but it almost seems like the ending was either re-written for whatever reason, or rushed to print. It just does not satisfy the reader. Too much is left dangling, too much left unfinished.I don't know, maybe this is just a lead-in to a sequel???"
5,Groovy but Smooth,Same as above two entries. How funny we all found this album by accident. Very smooth and groovy tunes. Wish I had thought of them.
3,It's a basic biography,"I checked this book out of my library, and found it to be informative, if not a little dry. It's a good book for people who are just discovering Holliday. Basic and a surprisingly quick read. Give it a try!"
2,"Great Music, Terrible Sound","I wish that the sound on the CD was anywhere close to ""Flowers of Evil"", if it had been I would have given it 5 stars. The music is really great live Mountain - maybe the best I've heard, but the sound is terrible."
4,Great Christopher Lee gem I am seeing for the first time.,"This is a very moody, atmospheric adaption. The sets and costumes are great as well as the acting. The movie is well cast! I always enjoy Christopher Lee as Dracula and did compare this to the Hammer versions, definitely a different interpretation. Herbert Lom is great as always too. Some of the scenes could have been tied together better, it seemed like some scenes were inserted at the wrong time. The special effects, especially the bat sequences could have been better. It's worth watching in any event."
3,Search for other options.,"Case was ok, except I did not like the back piece for the belt clip. If you did not want to use the belt clip the was an annoying piece sticking out which you could not remove. It made it almost hard to put it in your pocket.Otherwise, it protected my phone. Hopefully you don't need this case because I suggest not having a Motorola Razr, slim phone but not good quality."
4,Bodacious boot by the classic lineup,"I purchased this official bootleg with skepticism, wary of what the sound quality might be. Other than the vocals being a bit distant, the audio fidelity on this 32 year old recording ROCKS!Mountain has always been much better live than on their studio recordings. Leslie, Corky, and Felix blaze through a raucous set, including an improvised solo of Jingle Bells (!)Having seen many live shows at the now defunct Capitol Theater, this set holds some sentimental value for me. It is a treat for any hardcore Mountain fan. Highly recommended."
1,Don't have the item,"I might like the product if I got the product. I ordered this 5 weeks ago. I never received the package. Standard shipping from the USPS. I have contacted Siren Disc to get the tracking number, but they haven't replied. So much for ordering music via mail. I am disappointed with the whole process, no human to contact, no product, lost package from the Post Office. I know that this is suppose to be a review of THE product, but I couldn't complain about this any other way. So here I am."
5,nice,"Good quality craftsmanship.Nice, soothing gentle tones.Sound carrys a fair distance.Seems to take quite a breeze to make it work."
5,cd,"still love the very smooth soothing sound of Elvis Presley vioce,this cd hs some of my very favorite christmas as well"
1,Beware,"I purchased the battery despite some bad reviews. I should have known better. The battery does not fit my garmin gpsmap 478 very well. It keeps popping out. However, that is not the only problem. The battery would not charge completely. It would only charge to about a third of its potential."
2,does not fit 496,tried twice but both batteries were same. Neither snapped into place so i had to use duct tape to hold in place. Finally ordered genuine Garmin battery(cost 50% more)
2,poor fit in 276C,This battery is visibly different from my stock Garmin battery. Initially I couldn't get it to stay in the unit at all. Eventually I was able to push the latch forward enough to make it catch. Hopefully it won't fall out during use. Next time I'll probably pay for the Garmin replacement.
1,Slightly to Big,I have two (2) Garmin 478 GPS units. This battery would not snap into either unit. It was slightly to big. I had to return it. I dislike products made in China. The quality of chinese products are always marginally acceptable.
2,My grandson was disappointed,"My grandson was dissappointed with the bagpipes. They looked great, but did not function like he thought they would."
5,The impact of Mama's Window,"I was overjoyed to find Mama's Window, especially after viewing the fine video, Oh, Freedom After While, written and produced by Lynn Rubright, telling the story of the sharecropper's protest of 1939, spearheaded by the Rev. Owen Whitfield. Even though Sugar in Mama's Window was a fictionalized version of Whitfield as a child, he and the other characters in this heartwarming tale were beautifully and authentically drawn and came alive as a salute to the simplicity and, ultimately, the purity of life in one tiny shack in the Mississippi Delta many years ago. There are lessons to be learned and love to give and receive. I was captivated by this story. So will every child lucky enough to read it."
4,bag itself nice; company sent wrong color,"The bag I ordered was blossom/ash/black and what I received was a red/black bag. It took two weeks to receive my bag and then when I called the company that I ordered it from...there customer service was sad...they wanted me to send the bag back and then wait another two weeks to receive the correct bag, so I would have been out of a bag for a month!!!The bag itself is nice enough. It rolls great on concrete, grass, dirt. The handle slides in and out without a hitch and is long enough for someone of my height to easily handle it. The inside pocket for the laptop gets in the way when you are putting you books into it, but have learned to use my hand to guard against that opening. The side pocket for my drink isn't quite deep enough, but thus far I haven't lost my drink. Overall I'd recommend this bag, but I've only had it for a little while. Time is the ultimate test."
1,DREADFUL,"Reading a Danielle Steel book now is akin to watching a Kathie Lee Gifford Christmas special--so awful it's almost entertaining. Her characters are ALWAYS rich, beautiful and boring. Curiously, they are almost exclusively only children whose parents are dead. You can read the first chapter and predict the last. I howled with laughter when she describes the bonding conversation between the men. No men I know talk like that. Ms. Steel needs to get out in the real world. Go slumming in the middle class and listen in on real people talking. Stop redoing the same book with a different title. The last good book she wrote was Ghost."
2,Lurtz the orc,Hey Lurtz really is the strongest orc. I mean he could break even if you droped him 10 feet on to a hard surface. Speaking of his face it is dead on. But DO NOT get your hopes to high if your looking for a ACTION figure!Mabe if your kids play with him they will read the books.
2,Confused timeline and too much fighting,The thing about writing a series of historically related books is to keep a timeline as accurately as possible. In this instance the writer who took Barry Sadler's original notes (Sadler did not complete this one) made a real mess of it. The incidents in this overdone novel relate to the 1967 Six-Day War but chronologically in the Casca series it occurs AFTER 1970 (I think Sadler was going to write about the Yom Kippur War). Also this book tends to be one mad assault on an Arab fortress after another and it gets boring. The only relief is a brief lull in Jerusalem when Casca does a bit of reminiscing. Otherwise its really a waste of the readers time unless you like a Steve Spielberg-style all-action Rambo all-out war from page 1 to the finish. YAWN.
2,Anderson's/Beason's attempt at mystery fails,"This book contains what you'd come to expect of the Anderson/Beason team. A story that appears to well researched with good attention to detail and a pace that doesn't let you get bored easily. These are the high points. Unfortunately there's one big flaw that really couldn't keep me feel disappointed at the end. I figured out ""whodunnit"" before I was even halfway through. I kept hoping I had missed something that was going to reveal itself at the end, a wicked twist or something to make the whole read worhtwhile. Alas, for something that could've been a fun mystery/adventure turned out to be way too obvious and left me feeling a little shortchanged. As prolific as Kevin J is I sometimes wonder if his sheer volume of work sometimes makes his quality of work suffer."
4,Heard Rothenberg's journal on public radio,"...and that made me want to get the book. She was very prolific. Rothenberg was an awesome girl, with an awesome story."
4,Excellent Product,This trolley works great. We have a very excitable 50 lb Husky who takes full advantage of running in circles around the tree he is tethered too. Very rarely does he manage to tangle but on occasion when he moves slower it will wrap the tree. I definitely am going to be purchasing a second one for when we visit family.
4,Shhhhh--I'm A Closet Royal Watcher,"I can't help it. I like the gossip, the scandals, all the fal-de-ral with Royal watching. Not just the Brits, but this quality little photo bio book piqued my interest. Just about 80 photos covering William's life from opulent birth through tragic adolescence in 1998, one year after the demise of his mum, Princess Diana. Pix of trips, sports, school, family and semi-private precious reflections cast deep into his sad eyes.This is not just a *Tiger Beat* oooooo & ahhh, look at him book. Quite introspective as to what a royals life entails even at an early age. But, ok, he IS cute too! Authoress Valerie Garner interjects interesting factoids. Enjoyable addition to bio collections."
2,Meet Virginia is great - the rest is anticlimactical,"With the exception of the first track (meet virginia), this CD sounds like the one you bought from the bar band last friday night, played twice, and then exiled to that CD black hole in the trunk of your car or bottom of your closet. The band proved that they can knock the socks off their listeners but they fail to do so repeatedly throughout this CD even when the music seems to serve up the opportunity to do so. Although the band's raw, un-processed sound is great, tracks two onward just does'nt cut it. Hopefully however, we'll hear more from this band in the future in which they'll capitalize on their capability to compose and deliver truly inspired raw emotion translated into alternative rock like they did in the track ""meet virginia""."
1,Atrocious Boring Chaotic Disjointed,"I'll borrow a line from a reviewer of another unrelated album - ""I think a blank CD is worth more that this"". Nothing personal, but it just doesn't appeal to me in the least. Don't buy this CD, like I did, punting on the reviews being a good indicator. You must have a good listen to it first before you make your own mind up. There's a lot of good C&W, R&R or BW out there you can spend your money on instead."
2,It is country covered over with rock here and there.,"The only bright spot of this album just happens to be the very first song, ""Meet Virginia."" The rest of it is just painful to listen too. If you don't like country... it will be even more painful."
1,Enough already with bland alt-country,"Well, someone has to be the grim reaper and it looks like it's me. I found this record to be unoriginal, derivative, and uninspired. Train is yet another in the ever growing genre of alt-country best exemplifed by Uncle Tupelo (particularly March 16-20) and Golden Smog.I can't blame them for trying. It's very faddish and popular right now.If you're interested in acoustic based masterpieces, check out ""the good earth"" by the feelies, Whiskeytown's Faithless street, or sound of Lies by the Jayhawks."
5,DA BOMB!,This CD is awsome it's one of those CD's that the songs stick in your head (Tha's a good thing) and you can't stop singing or humming them. My favorite is of course Meet Virginia that song just describes me perfectly I love this CD THANK YOU SO MUCH TRAIN YOUR CD IS THE BEST!
4,"Whimsical, yet reflective","I purchased this CD after having heard ""Meet Viginia"" on the radio and after a complete listen I was amazed. Great lyrics set with awesome music. Nice ballads and fun bar rockers. The song ""I Am"" made the biggest impact on me because of the singers reflective look at his life thus far, something I can relate to at age 35. ""Free"" just flat out rocks and makes me believe that I can dust off my acoustic guitar and play right along (doubtful! ). I classify this as deck music with the gang or good road trip fare. Buy Listen Enjoy!"
4,Classic for Dummies book,"If you want to learn World History as easily as you learned EXCEL, Word, Powerpoint, or any other program or discipline through the Dummies series, get this book right now.Also, this is history that makes sense. The author does not just follow a boring chronological order, but bunch historical events together that have similarities, connections, parallels. As a result, this is the type of history lesson that makes sense, and is easy to understand and remember. Nothing like the boring history fare you were served in high school."
1,Pick something else!,"The author divides the book in several short sections (e.g. history of major events, history of philosophical ideas, history of wars, etc). As a result, everything is so cramped and fragmented that it's impossible to get the big picture. E.g. the actual 'history of major events' section has aprox. 100 pages - way to little to summarize thousands of years of world history.Obviously, everything is relative, but I would have failed the exam I bough it for had I relied only on this material. History is whole, a mixtum compositum, of religious, military, philosophical etc ideas and events - not a series of separated and fragmented dots.Overall, a disappointing experience - and an unusual one, considering that most books in the ""Dummies"" series I used beforehand were simply great!"
5,Despite Being Frowned Upon,"Utterly fascinating, vivid, moving description of a little-known area of Judaism. Appalling as it may be to many Western Jews, saint veneration is an ancient, deeply felt practice that is shared by Jews and Muslims in North Africa, and that is tenaciously observed despite being frowned upon by the ""official"" arbiters of tradition."
1,Shoot Them All ... But Start with the Director,"...I really wanted to like this film. The girls assembled are fabulous, but that's where it ends. The story is neither erotic, nor interesting. All I can say is if I were the director, and I had this gorgeous cast, I would have stayed up way past midnight to write a script that was highly charged, erotic and used my talent to their fullest potential.Do yourself a favor. Save your money and go bowling instead."
5,The Definative Jefferson Airplane Album,"THIS BOX SET ROCKS!! Some of the stuff on disc one is garage band quality. But the beauty and artistry of this choatic band is well demonstrated here. The soulful harmonies blended with Jorma smashing the harsh tremolo tones upside your head is a true joy. If you like the impromptu, and the unpredictable, you will love this. If you were to only buy one album by this band, this would be a wise choice!"
3,German is not an easy language to learn.,"My learning style is not to memorize lists of words. I believe this is a good book to go along with audio tapes, but is difficult as a stand alone book; unless it was in a classroom setting."
2,Poorly written means hard to read,"Just about any other book on the subject would have to better than this book. The poor writing turns simple concepts into puzzles. Although I was deeply interested in the subject matter, this book read like a college text book on a subject I was forced to take. I liked the concise code examples, but then I would cringe at the author's explanation of the code. Also to be fair, some portions of the book are actually written clearly. It is very evident that the book was put together by more than one person. Some of the good sections are quite interesting; while other sections are quite comical in a grammatical sense. Furthermore, as a science student, my English is not great. Therefore, it takes a real disaster for me to notice the writing quality."
2,Didn't enjoy it.,"I've only read a few books on the subject of philosophy so I'm definitely no expert, but this book was the most ridiculous I've read so far. While I embrace the possibility of a God and am not opposed to authors writing about why they do likewise I think its a bit irresponsible how much Tom Morris enforces his views on the matter in what is supposed to be an introduction to philosophy. Obviously the people reading this book won't have a strong knowledge on how philosophical arguments work (I don't), so it's not difficult to manipulate the reader into believing profound ideas with an elaborate train of thought that can be hard to keep up with.I could talk about how ridiculous his anecdote was about a psychic grandmother prophesying who he would marry and all the other bull**** I had to sift through to get a few gems, but then this would start to look more like a rant than a review.Toodles."
1,Assumptions,"The author uses the reverse logic to decide which viewpoints he wants to drill into you over the course of 350 pages. He has conclusions he wants to ""prove"", and along the way he adopts whatever viewpoint will help him ""prove"" his beliefs later on. He just blindly assumes certain things must be true because they ""feel"" true, which is a horrible way to construct an objective introduction to philosophy. An awful disappointment of what could be a great book."
4,...but What is the Answer to the Question...,"The author discusses and explains the perennial question of philosophy from the point of view of an intelligent layman. It is issues based and doesn't attempt any historical perspective.The best thing about this book is that the author provides his answers to these perennial questions. He doesn't try the antiseptic ""present each view as equally valid"" approach. Instead, he tells us where he is comming from and why. I like this approach because, as a reader, his perspective serves as a reference point. Weather one accepts his view or not Tom does a good job of explaning why he believes what he does and what considerations are important. He also provides the oposing viewpoint. Philosophy for Dummies will not teach you the systems or ideas of the great philosophers. However, if your goal is to understand the issues and formulate your answers, this book is one of the best!"
2,unbelievably biased writing,"Anyone with any real philosophy background will imediately see the bias Morris has that gets in the way of an objective analysis of philisophical issures. (But what do you expect when you have a 16 year professor of Notre Dame write a ""philosopy book"")? This book should be called ""the catholic worldview, with some extra stuff"". I am normally happy with ""dummies"" books but this one is very dissapointing. Morris's bias reaks on almost every page, with his usage of quotes, ""great idea"" marks, and poorly covered topics.If you really want an objective analysis of philosophical issues, dont buy this. If you are a christian who wants to reinfoce your worldview, this will help."
2,Too religious.,It's clear where this author's beliefs lie. An introductory book should have less bias.
1,Philosophy it aint,"This is a well presented book in an enjoyable format but it is not a general philosophy book. The author spends a large amount of time proving the existence of god. While he is entitled to his opinion on that subject he sneaks up on people who think they are getting a general introduction to philosophy but are actually getting ""How to prove god exists in the coffee shop."" This is of course excellent fun for the non-theists for there is nothing like proving something you think is total hog-wash. In the hands of theists however it becomes a Gollum-like struggle for the ring.Lots of other good general introductions to philosophy out there. Tom give up philosophy and become a minister."
1,One-sided view of the world!,"This book ignores philosophies like Buddhism, Taoism, and Confucius, which over 40% of the planet have followed. It's true that the book pretends that no such eastern philosophies exist. The common dictionary offers better coverage. A book I recently finished, Understanding Einstein, goes into greater detail covering the many philosophies the world has to offer. Readers need to go to books like The Art of Happiness to find what this book clearly overlooked. Voltaire's Philosophical Dictionary also offers great insights into the every-changing views of philosophy."
1,Just Plain Bad Presentation,"If I had a penny for every straw man, i.e. an argument intentionally presented in a poor light, knocked down in this book, then I would have gotten back the money I spent on it.It doesn't bother me that Morris wrote a book that presents his own philosophy. It doesn't even bother me that he is no good at presenting a viewpoint he doesn't agree with. What bothers me is that the book is supposed to be a crash-course in general philosophy, and what Morris gives is just his own beliefs.I found the arguments for and against God's existence to be of a particularly poor quality."
2,Too Biased and Self-Promoting,"Too biased. The author disregards many philosophies with merely a paragraph while pushing his own ideas (how convenient). The author's attempts to make the reader swallow his 'Principle of Belief Conservation', or as I have re-named it, the 'La-Di-Da I Can't Hear You Principle', left a bad taste in my mouth.His oft-repeated degree-dropping line of ""While at Yale"" made me wonder if he tried to title the book ""Philosophy for Dummies. Hey, I graduated from Yale. Yep, that Yale."""
3,squishy pillow,"I got this pillow hoping that the center portion of the pillow would be as resistant to weight as the ends. Not so. However, I am using it and the middle does keep my neck about 1/2 to 1"" off the bed."
3,This mouse could use caffeine,"Pros- Fits hand well, excellent navigation on most surfaces, receiver fits inside mouse making it easy to carry in a laptop case.Cons- Mouse battery saving feature works too well. The mouse falls asleep and is either difficult to wake or does not wake up at all.This is a great mouse when it is working. It is responsive when awake and the Setpoint tool allows you to configure the mouse for your navigation style. My biggest complaint is the mouse will shutdown after 10 seconds of inactivity and does not want to respond when it is moved. I find myself resetting the mouse quite often during work or play session. I have asked Logitech about the problem and they don't seem to recognize it. Even after reloading the drivers and the software (Logitech's recommendation) it still has the same problem. If you are in need of a mouse that responds when you need it to don't buy this one."
2,I'm Disappointed,"I was looking forward to this and was hoping it would be good.Unfortunately, these appear to be scanned images rather than actual text. On the Kindle for PC, I had a small rectangle of text in a big white window, and it was just too small and blurry to read comfortably. It's legible, barely, but not enough to read the text with any comfort, and I wouldn't want to try it on my e-ink Kindle in the kitchen to cook from. Some pages have shadowy ""artifacts"" on them from scanning which is visually disturbing, as well, in the ""am I seeing it or not"" kind of way.Someone else may have the eyes or the patience to work with this book. I'm afraid neither fit me."
4,An interesting book reflecting a unique way of life,I liked this book. It did have a few pages upside down and did not have a table of contents but it was definitely worth reading for me. This lady had a very busy and exhausting day every day and she still took the time to be neighborly and helpful. Her recipes are much like I grew up with for I am from the same area and if you take the time to explore the book with an open uncritical eye you will get insights into a unique way of life.
4,Decent scarf,"This is a good, functional scarf. The material is typical polar fleece. It's soft, but not exceptionally so. It's very warm, but you can breathe through it if you use it to cover your face. It's made from acrylic and polyester, and it is machine washable.One complaint I might have is that the edges are finished with stitching that feels rough to the touch. Also, I would have liked to have seen a few more inches of length. But it's certainly long enough to use.Overall, this scarf is nothing to get excited about, and the full retail price seems a bit high, but if you get it on sale, you won't regret it. It does what you need a scarf to do."
1,Get a LIFE!,"I started reading this book as part of an online book club and loved it. I went to the library (thank God I didn't pay for it) and checked it out. Kathie is 37 years old and she acts like a 19 year old! Can this woman not have an adult conversation to save her life? Are all Scots the rudest people on the planet? (I know for a fact they are not.) PLUS, she's supposed to be a writer researching a book. She does no writing and little investigating. All she cares about is trapping Iain into marriage. The whole thing is juvenile. I loved Iain character, but why he would be attracted to Kathie is beyond me. Ugh."
2,Too annoying.,"I absolutely love Katie MacAlister, she does an amazing job in creating characters and storylines to catch your imagination. The one thing I did not like about this book is that towards the end Kathie became so whiny and irritating, especially the scene at the end where she receives a puppy, I wanted to strangle her and I've felt that a lot of Katie Mac's characters have been the same but with different names and slightly rising in annoyance, I think i'll stick to her dragon septs series because those are much much better."
2,Not my favorite,"I liked Improper English and was so exited about this new book of Katie Makalister. Well, I did not finish that book. Boring, boring, boring.I did not like a plot, I did not care about any of many characters. I will be very careful to choose another Mrs. Makalister book."
2,the disappointment..,"I had read the Corset Diaries and thought I'd give this author another shot. I only got halfway through. It seemed to lack the wit of the previous book and the main female character was so whiney and tear streaked that it drove me nuts. the main male character barely showed any feelings and halfway through the book they're already planning the wedding. I like my main characters to be so strongly developed it's like they're right here when i read. And i get sick of the wimpy ""i need my man to save my butt"" attitude of the females as well. If you like all her other books, I'd say give it a shot. But I really don't care how it ends and to me, that means it wasn't written very well."
3,ONLY OK!,"I usually love Ms McAllister's work, but Men in Kilts is mediocre. The two main characters are not special and the storyline is EH!!!This is the author's first book that was less than great. Still, all in all, I'm looking forward to her next."
3,It Gets Better,"I was unsure of this book while reading the first chapter because the protagonist seemed a bit flighty. She does some silly things that made me cringe. I actually had to shut the book and take a moment to remind myself that her actions were supposed to be funny. Despite some of her antics, I would recommend the book. I liked that it took place over a long period of time, not just a week or month, which is typical in romance novels. I also have a yen for men in kilts, so I understand the obsession and the lure of the Scottish brogue.The setting in the Highlands is interesting and I learned more about sheep than I ever thought I would."
2,the frezeing game,Once Iinstald it in I was excided. But when it was done it keep frezeing. so I keep trying and it started working. about half way throgh sonics part it froze again. so I did the same thing and it still didn't work. So now I'm stuck on one part.:(
3,Good Info,"This is a well written and easy to read reference. I'd have liked to see a little more detail, more photos and breakdowns. It is a bit on the short side too. That said, it's easier to comprehend than may 'historical' tomes on knights."
5,Great Space Saver,"These are the same nice cases that you often find in box sets containg more than two DVDs. I am currently copying family VHS tapes to DVD and they are great for the copies. Of course if you record movies from television then you will need something to put your DVD in and these are really nice, the DVDs are held securely in place."
1,Very disappointed...,"For Mac users, - the latest software version that is FREE... only is supported by Mac OS 10.3... are you kidding me? Then they want you to buy a $35.00 version of the program. This is absolute crap! Free for Windows Users! Plus the paper is mediocre at best. I should have just done it all in Photoshop using Professional Quality paper, I thought this would be a quicker alternative, yet, dollar for dollar, pro- paper and photoshop will get you better results, FASTER! Don't waste your time."
2,really not very helpful!,"I'm not sure why this guidebook was rated so highly. I found it poorly organized, hard to use, and anti-helpful. The restaurants and hotels it raved about were mediocre or worse. We stayed in one of the hotels it recommended in Quepos, and ended up moving to one that was the same price and much better, yet didn't have much written about it in this book. The book was terrible about saying where things were--one restaurant was described as ""300 meters south of Mas x Menos"" (a grocery store). No street name given, even though the streets in that part of San Jose do have names. We searched fruitlessly for a long time."
4,Pirate Hat Review,"This hat works if you don't have other options. But it is funky in that it's made from scuba diving-like material and fits on your head kind of like a glove. It's not a real hat. However, it works."
4,Wonderful character ... great story!,A wonderful story that will stay with you for a long time. I found myself searching the web to see if Jenny Sanders Pryor was a real person - she certainly seemed so to me after reading the book. Very enjoyable!
1,WHERE IS THE SOUND,Would be nice to watch it and I would have even paid to do so but there is no sound. Not gonna read lips for $1.99.
1,Sons of Anarchy is awesome but...,"Do not buy from AMAZON DIGITAL on anything! I bought music from here with no drm and am able to put it on anything I like, but with this I pay RETAIL PRICES and I am LOCKED OUT of my PURCHASE! Amazon you have proven to me that I will never buy anything digital from you tv or movie section ever again. I might change my mind if you remove said drm off of >>>RETAIL PRICES<<<. I can understand the drm for rental, but when I pay retail I expect to be able to do whatever the hell I want with it! This is a sad day for me Amazon. You made a paying customer die a little inside."
1,Sons of Anarchy: Season Three,Upon receiving this set everything seemed fine until I began the fourth disk. I saw nothing but moving white lines. My return to Amazon went extremely well. The cost of the series and cost of shipping was quickly and without questions refunded by Amazon. Then I ordered it again. Not only was disk four all black (as in blank) but it would not eject from my player. I tried to play it on two DVD players and had the same result. The seller is fully responsible for sending out these faulty DVD'S. Once again I will be sending this set back.
5,Can't Live without SOA,"In my opinion this is the best season so far! seller shipped very fast, can't beat the price. awesome! Any SOA fans should have this in their dvd collection"
5,Awesome Show!!!,I think this show is so amazing!!! They haven't seen 1 episode that I found boring and I could just really watch this series over and over again... Can't wait till Season 3 comes on DVD!!! I would recommend this series to anyone not just biker fans!!
5,great gift,"My son is a fan of the series. This is one of three I bought him for Christmas. Great service from Amazon, as usual."
3,A good episode marred by a HUGE plot hole. *spoilers*,"If you've enjoyed Sons of Anarchy up to this point, you'll enjoy this episode. It has the same interesting characters, incredible acting and violent, gritty action the series is known for. However, this episode also features a plot hole the size of Charming. So Gemma is on the run from the feds and goes to visit her father. Logically, wouldn't that be one of the first places the feds would cover in their search? Also, how come the phones Clay and Gemma were speaking on weren't tapped?For a show that is usually so tightly plotted, it strikes me as odd that the writers would let something like that slide. Maybe as the season goes on and more is revealed, this stuff will be given some context, but for now, it remains a big fly in the ointment of a good premiere.All this being said, the ending really caught me off guard, and will surely be one of the most talked about events in the series."
5,Christmas success,This year I ordered the third season of Sons of Anarchy...last year I ordered the first two. My son was very happy. The delivery and condition of the product was great. I have had great success with all purchases from Amazon. I am a dedicated customer for all my dvd and cd orders. Love them!
5,Sons of anarchy season 3,The antics continue in season 3. Who doesn't love Jacks ... Just saying ! Love it!Sons of Anarchy: Season Three
5,best show on tv,I buy my husband every year for his birthday which is in August the new season when it comes out on dvd I guess I will until the show is over
4,pretty good episode,"This episode was good like they all are, but not quite the calibur of the two 90 min episodes from last season. Last season's 90 min episodes packed more action. No complaints though that unless of course I mention Dish Network. This 1.99 is well spent money and makes me think that Internet TV will be the way to go for everything once Google TV gets up to snough"
3,disc skip,"Order arrived quickly, skipping on disc interrupted viewing. I had purchased season 2 earlier and that was worse, hard to view"
5,Eye-opening info -- great organization.,The book shows great strategys for long term option investing. Makes it easy and simple. Anyone who knows options will like Leaps because the strategys are much more flexible. Highly recommend the book as user friendly and useful. I am going to use a lot of the things like using Leaps instead of jsut buying stocks. Good stuff!
3,1 Song,"Totally worth the price of admission for ""SO WHAT"" alone; one of the great R-n_R songs of all time."
1,Don't waste your money,"Boppy seems to be one of those staples ever new mommy thinks she needs. You don't. Wait till you have your baby and if you stick with breast feeding before you spend $35 on this pillow. That's all it is, a pillow and if your like me, you have plenty of those already. I had a C-Section and tried breast feeding with the Boppy. Holy Cow was it painful. The last thing I wanted was anything up against my belly. Then once I stopped breast feeding I found my husband's recliner and a pillow from my sofa propper under my arm worked a lot better, plus I don't have some goofy pillow that doesn't match my sofa laying around. Boppy is a great idea but just doesn't translate well. My advice, wait, get home, get settled and in a few weeks if you've had it with the pillows, go buy one."
3,First Time For This Author,"This was the first book I've read by this author. I've read many books by varying writers and favor those mysteries that add a little humor to their stories and styles. I was a little disappointed in my first read by Ms. Farmer as I felt it was pretty slow going and didn't really catch my attention until midway. Too much emphasis on the game of Mah-Jongg and how it's played for my tastes. It may have been just the theme of this particular book that was off for me. Hopefully, ""Killer Wedding"" or ""Sympathy For The Devil"" will make me want to become a follower of Jerrilyn Farmer's work."
5,Perfect for lining baby diapers!,These booster pads work really well if you have a child who wakes up wet in the mornings even with overnight diapers. My son was wearing size 6 overnight Huggies and still soaking through - so his babysitter suggested these booster pads. What a huge difference they make! The mini size is perfect for size 6 diapers and would probably work for even sizes 3 or 4 since they don't completely fill the diaper.
2,"Absorbent, but Irritating!","I was expecting something soft and absorbent like the old baby diaper doubles, but these were hard and thin and caused me a great deal of skin irritation. I will not be able to use the ones I purchased. They were however quite absorbent."
1,Bad message for children,"This book is a collection of inscriptions collected from children, only there are some really nasty and mean ones included! I don't know what the authors were thinking but this is NOT a book for any children who aim to be peaceful and accepting individuals.Kids sometimes write mean things to each other; kids will be kids....but for two adults to collect and publish some of these nasty insults gives children a message that not only is it OK, but it's worthwhile. For instance: ""You remind me of London - always in a fog!"" Or, ""girls faults are many, boys have only two - everything they say and everythign they do."" Just a sample, some are even worse. Why would anyone want to teach sayings like this to children?i would highly recommend that you not buy this book for your chiildren."
2,Hiking where?,"I agree with the other reviewer as to the difficulty finding the trail from the only locator map, the entire state of California! A regional map for each section with main arteries and a few nearby towns would have been a big help.Now about that map of the entire state of California; isn't the title of the book ""Hiking NORTHERN California""? Well, I see 5 hikes in the South Coast Range, 18 south of Lake Tahoe and 29 in the Southern Sierra Nevada! The southern-most hike is just a stones throw from Bakersfield. If you want to avoid chilly hikes, this is the book for you."
5,Great guide!,"Great hiding guide: thorough and lots of detail, such as elevation gain charts and key points. Compared many guides side-by-side in the store before deciding on this one. User-friendly. I highly recommend it."
5,A happy first time shopper with Amazon -,It was so convenient to buy from your company. I bought the jacket originally from a local department store but it was too small. I decided to try and buy it on line. It couldn't have been easier. Thank you!
3,Diannes' Best,"This CD is nice, but you really have to listen to the words to relate to whats being said from the time that it was produced."
1,A truly annoying album,"First, I am a major fan. However, I hate when people mess with something that ain't broke. AND WHEN I DIE, SWEET BLINDNESS are updated and not in a good way. Yes, I understand artists want to do their songs differently after many years, but sometimes it just doesn't work. The music on this CD is too spacey and her voice is incredibly annoying. I found myself skipping over track after track. ELI is still her best work as both a songwriter and recording artist."
4,Coolest Scrap Iron You'll ever buy,"Cheaply made heavy bike parts quickly bolted together is the physical reality of this bicycle. But the vibe is what this is all about, at it's very cool. Who wants to go fast anyway? This bike is too cool for speed. It's that mysterious something about slow, laid back crusing on a one ton bicycle that you're buying into. The wheelbase is really long, the tires are really fat and a passenger can easily sit on the butterfly handlebars (is that where the name 'Deuce' comes from?)...and the flames...oh yeah, baby...da flames!! Forget about that lightweight alloy and carbon composite stuff....cheap thick steel rocks."
3,Fan here so...,"I have all M. Bolton's cd's now and this is not a favorite , however, I played it many times over the holidays. Shipment was quite speedy."
3,Going downhill,"I've watched ""Entourage"" from the beginning and from the first fell in love with all the boys. I loved the plotlines and since it's filmed mostly in LA, I loved the whole concept. But this season, while still good, it is not up to snuff. Vince seems to only be a background character this season. None of the plotlines have revolved totally around him. Turtle has come to the front, about time, and Eric's love life and Drama's career has lots of play, but Vince seemed to just be there for one-liners.And after the recent tirades by Mel Gibson, which made me sick, the way Ari yelled, screamed and insulted Lloyd sure didn't go down too well with me. Ari spent most of this season yelling his head off, and I never could figure out why he hated Lloyd so much.I read someplace that next season will be the last. I think's it's probably time."
3,really average,"This season was a real downturn in quality. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't anything like the previous seasons. Vince is a non-entity in the season. And all the other characters are basically involved in their own disconnected subplots. We get tons of relationship filler for Turtle and E. Drama was there alot but didn't do much. And the bulk of the show ended up focused on Ari and Lloyd which had really kind of run its course already. They (again) basically neglected the idea of Eric being a manager in favor of putting Sloan into every episode.They managed to get wrong almost everything that entourage had previously got right. The show is entourage. It works when it focuses on the guys together and how they interact. Turning it into a personal growth and relationship show is a very bad idea. There were also too much celebrity cameos that were forced in and had nothing to do with the plot. And no more Matt Daemon in the show ever!"
5,Well written and interesting,"This is a blazing, gloves off history of the Reformation! Belloc highlights the political and military struggles of the period (almost leaving the religious turmoil as an afterthought). Belloc uses this as a device to show the reader that the events surrounding this period were far more than a religious quarrel, it involved conspiracies between zealots who allowed church lands to be looted and people who favored the absolute power of the monarchy over and above any temporal papal power. It's a good and quick read that engages the intellect."
5,BIPOLAR DISORDER FOR DUMMIES,THIS WAS A GIFT THE RECEIVER SAID THEY LIKED IT I REALLY CAN NOT COMENT ON THIS ITEM SINCE IT WAS A GIFT
3,"Strange Fits of Passion, a Novel","Pretty typical. Attraction, marriage, personality shift, anger and abuse, escape, new love interest and finally, revenge! Though the description of the area was informative it was repetitive. Should have been more attentive to the book description before I purchased it. In questioning whether Mary suffered from abuse or was actually injured in an auto accident, someone must have been able to determine this. Don't think this should have been in question. When Mary took the money from her husband's pocket, how much was he carrying???? She lived on it for a long time, paying for everything she needed. That's a lot of pocket money to carry around! For a professional woman,she comes off as not very smart in a lot of ways.Amazon.com purchase."
4,A compelling book,"I listened to this book on tape. I enjoyed the reading and the story. The reader does the Maine accents well and gives each character a recognizable voice. I like books that make the characters feel real, and make me feel like I could be reading a true story. It depicted the development and susquent conclusion of an abusive relationship as seen by the abuse survior and the community around her. The reader could be a voyuer into the relationship. I found it very provocative."
4,A good read,I have liked all of Anita Shreve's novels. If you are looking for a book that will be a nice easy and entertaining read during a vacation - like lets saying laying on a beach somewhere then this book or one of Anita's novels is for you. They all about love and violence. You want to know who did the crime but also will the love affair last or not.
5,Great new studio recordings by Roger Williams--Mr. Piano,"There's not a down-note on this most recent piano outing by Roger Williams. The master of the keyboard has provided us with some of his finest interpretations to date. This cd is a must for any fan of popular music. The Roger-touch is evident in these songs......a little jazz, a little classical, but much in taste and perfection. But why only 10 songs?"
1,Disappointed!,"I had purchased three other lamps just like this one at a local store. I needed one more and purchased online. The one I received looked TOTALLY different from the ones I purchased in the store even though it was the same brand name and model. It was painted a cheap gold color (to look like brass) and was made of a cheap, light material. It is a VERY CHEAP knockoff of the real lamp. VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!"
2,Where to begin,"I like the mask alot, It is scary and all But....There is no nose holes so it is very hard to breathe in. The eye holes are very small. Its very hard to see out of."
5,GOOD SUFF TO BYE,I LOVE IT IT LOOKS SO GOOD ON MY TRUCK I WILL BUY FROM AMAZON ALL THE TIME THANK YOU IF YOU R LOOKING FOR A CHROM HOOD SHIELD BUY THIS ONE IT IS THE BEST
4,Track Listing,1. Exit 992. Pretending To Cry3. Tough On Love4. One Of Those Things5. Betrayed6. It's All In The Heart7. What Would Elvis Do8. Dance With The One That Brought You9. Two Ships That Passed In The Moonlight10.Everything
4,Definitely worth reading!!,"Suspenseful, entertaining, a very good read. Forsyth, though, was a bit slow in caputuring the readers' interest but as the book progressed, the reader is taken in by the plot and suspense to find out what happens next. I must agree with some of the previous critics though. Although it was necessary to give the reader very little direct information about the Jackal in order to effectively portray his character, a little bit more subtle or implied information could have been hinted hear and there concerning his training and so forth. Aditionally, although the book was a good read, I felt dissapointed with its ending. My final questions were, ""that's it ... is that all?"" However, these final quesitons also attest to the book's powerful plot and its ability to keep the reader engrossed to the very end. In spite of a few shortcomings, it's an overall good read and I definitely recommend it. I must commend Forsyth."
3,Is It Really Supposed to Be That Good?,"Maybe I just don't like this genre, but I thought this book was average. I heard some guy on the radio saying this was the greatest book ever written and I bought a copy for my Kindle. The writing is unexceptional and in places is poor. Yes, it's a clever story line, but much of the book is tedious (extensive descriptions of guns and target practice). If you like this kind of thing then the Bourne books are a much more exciting ride in my view.I don't read this kind of thing very often and after I do I vow never to do so again, but I get sucked in every few years or so. I must confess that I am not the target audience for this kind of book. If you love thrillers and spy stories, you may think this is great, but to me it was just average. (I mean, at the end of the day you know how it has to end!!!! DeGaulle was not assassinated!!!!)"
1,I can't believe I had the will to finish this.,"A few boring, shallow, stereotyped characters move through endless variations on a chase scenario. Everyone in the book either works toward his goal, or thinks about how best to accomplish it. Meanwhile they show absolutely no emotion. They might as well be robots. (Both main characters are described serveral times as ""meticulous"") And get this-- it's five hundred pages.Go ahead and tell me it's escapist fun and that anything as highbrow as character psychology doesn't matter, but if you think anything this repetetive and endless is ""fun"" or ""thrilling,"" you're probably just fooling yourself based on all the hype."
5,Think the book was great? SEE THE MOVIE (THE ORIGINAL!),"Book was fantastic! The movie equally so as it was very faithful to the book. The movie version I refer to is the original one from 1973 directed by Fred Zinnemann (sp?). It is still available on video and any major video store (Blockbuster, Hollywood, etc...) should have no trouble finding it for you."
5,Perfect reading material for any would be assassin,"They are the veterans of the futile war in Algeria. The President cares nothing for them, their cause or their forgotten colony. Attempt after attempt to take the life of the president have failed. Simply put: the OAS is dying. With informers at every level and no money left, they seek retribution.The only man on earth capable of full filling their lust for vengeance is an anonymous, blond english man who calls himself -- The Jackal. Unknown to every police force and secret service on earth, The Jackal does not exist. With a price of half a million dollars The Jackal will assassinate the most heavily guarded man on earth-President Charles de Gualle.With utmost precision and professionalism we follow the Jackal through his elite plan to kill his target.This was a sweet novel. This book should be read by any would-be assassin and by every would-be writer who wants to write about Assassins..."
3,Great build-up but lacks climax,"The title of the book is ""The Day of The Jackal"" but on the actual day of the Jackal its a big let down. The two main characters meet, say each others names and then... I was left with the feeling of ""that's it?"""
3,A rather boring book,"Even though some scenes in the book are worth being read, the whole story lacks of suspense and is therefore rather boring.I have certainly read better thrillers than this one."
2,Slow Moving and Tedious at Times,"I bought this book on hopes that it would be a gripping read about spies, sabotage, and suspense. This novel moved very slowly and was bogged down with French details, too many acronyms, and weak, uninteresting plot development. On one level, the Jackal's character was interesting, mysterious and somewhat dynamic, but this novel dragged and was such a slow read. Look elsewhere for a page-turner. Ken Follett's Eye of the Needle is a far better choice in this genre; now that was a fantastic, gripping spy novel."
2,Flakes of the world unite,"If Elvis didn't die in 1977, he probably eventually did die laughing while reading this book. The author's main proof that Elvis is alive seems to be the fact that her book ""Orion"" (which tells about an Elvis-like singer who fakes his own death) didn't manage to sell many copies. Of course, its got to be a conspiracy! Still, I'll give it two stars just for its humor factor. The tape is really kind of boring (when did Elvis become so pointlessly verbose?) but in the book, we find out all the details on the author's psychic abilities, the conspiracy that kept Gary Hart from becoming President, astrology, and just all sorts of things. After reading this book, I had to wonder if there was anything the author didn't believe in!"
4,great shorts,Very thorough. Well written. Hopefully there will be a part II to this book. It seems to be better than many of my other books.
5,KIESLOWSKI AT HIS VERY BEST....Très Charmante,"As with the other entries in the TRICOLORES trilogy, Kieslowski has given us another slice of his soul. One could easily leave off saying ""I have seen the enemy, and he is me"", for Kieslowski always gives us humanity at its most diverse. The common thread through all 3 films is mankind's devices for handling pain and anguish, and he allows us to make our own interpretations. Just as with BLEU, with Juliette Binoche, and BLANC, with Julie Delpy, Kieslowski has offered up another masterpeice in ROUGE with the truly beautiful and talented Irene Jacob. Of the three, RED is my personal favorite, on the weight of Jacob and Jean-Louis Trintignant as a character of central importance to the past and to Jacob's future; however, I strongly recommend all three, and in the Correct French order of Blue, White and Red."
1,Great Movie: But this is an abridged version!,"I just purchased a copy of Miracle on 34th Street to watch with my family on Thanksgiving 2011. Right away, we noticed that it seemed to be moving at a rapid pace with major gaps in the storyline. It wasn't long before we realized that this is a 47 minute abridged version of the original classic. I purchased this movie from my Sony Bluray player and nowhere did it indicate in the description that this film is abridged, nor did any other version of the movie (other than the more recent remake) appear in the list of film options. I am extremely unhappy with this purchase and advice others not to purchase this film. I'm going to be deleting it from my digital library."
5,Great Christmas Movie,Received promptly and in good condition.I enjoy all the editions of The Miracle on 34th Street. Decided to try this one and enjoyed it also.
5,Good variety of songs.,The cd provides various remixes of two songs from the Black Star album. The two songs have excellent production and sound quality.
4,Good foundation for developers,"I found this book very informative. I would recommend using it in conjunction with a good J2ME reference guide (such as Learning Wireless Java). The examples work (I was very surprized by this...), if you want to start writing games this will give you a good foundation."
4,A Really Good Fairy Tale For Lovers of Pokemon,"This is my official Pokemon movie review part 3 of 10. The Spell of the Unown, I don't like titles like that. I would have much rather preferred ""Entei and the Mystery of the Unown,"" but hey, that's not my decision. I think this movie is a good one. I like the whole fairy tale aspect of it. It actually gets me in my creative mode. Entei was the first unreal pokemon, being that he was just a creation of the Unown and not the real Entei. I liked that Mrs. Ketchum had more of a role in this movie. I always thought they could do something more with her away from that horrible Mr. Mime. It's a good movie to watch when you're trying to clear your head."
4,pretty good,the movie is very good but it just keeps on going...but the graphes are the best they are so beautiful.
5,The Fun & Excitement Continues..,"If you loved the first two Pokemon movies... then you'll love this movie too. The creators haven't let anyone down with this release!!. It seems that the Pokemon Eps on TV are enough to get children of all ages and even the occasional adult hooked on it!... but most of the talent of the creators is saved for these movies. I love the Pokemon Eps but LOVE the movies.An excellent choice... kids love it, adults love it, you'll love it!... 9 stars out of 5...!!Always Mirren"
1,Not Compatible with Civic 2009 LX,"Amazon's ""garage"" claims that it is compatible but it is not. I should have checked with Metra's website which will tell you exactly what is compatible (I need the Metra 70-1722). The description needs to be updated and Amazon needs to fine tune their compatibility tools."
5,Thanks!,"Above and beyond expectations for service, great price too. Very fast and friendly. This was the wrong harness, I ordered it wrong, they offered to exchange it for free, but I had already replaced it since it was a weekend and they weren't open the day I replaced it on my own. Thanks again guys!"
1,Doesnt fit!,I am putting subs in my Girlfriends car and got an aftermarket deck. But what do you know the radio harness i bought doesnt clip into existing plug its a 1998 honda civic and im pretty sure it says fits 98 and up so whats the deal!
2,Doesn't have all the pins that are needed,I purchased this and ended up having to buy another one because it didn't have all the pins for the steering wheel control and one other item in my 2008 Honda Element SC. I was able to find many useful guides online to figure out that I needed more pins and then I was able to configure this correctly and get it working.
5,Check out the clouds. What does that symbol mean on the weather map.,"This book shows you the different clouds, how to measure weather as you go along, and the pictures are wonderful examples of what you will see when you look up during the day.. what do they call that bunny shaped cloud... look in the book."
5,"Max Mem, Min Price","I needed a memory card for my Rio 500. After searching around I found the VIking 64MB smart media card. Its great. Its 64MB and its smart. It went out and passed my finals while I overslept. Just kidding. But seriously, it works so great! I don't know how I lived with the puny 64MB that the Rio came with. This memory card is just so absolutely awesome that I went and bought another one two weeks later so now I can carry a ton of tunes and a bunch of audiobooks from Audible."
5,Great quality at a great price!,I used the 64 MB SmartMedia Card by Viking on our trip to Europe this past September and was very much impressed with the quality of the pictures I had printed. This is an excellent item for a great price. The Olympus equivalent costs at least $40 to $50 more! This is a great deal.
4,Love it!,"Ive been taking Latin for the past 2 semesters, and we never really go over any sort of grammer in class. Because of the lack of real teaching, I had to find a book online to help me. After getting 3 other books I finally got this one, and it was the best choice I made. It tells exactly what should be done and why. If I didn't have this book, I wouldn't be continuing on to 3rd Semester and probably 4th semester latin. Love it!"
5,Clear,"Straight forward, no-nonsense, plain-language latin training with consistent quizzing and reviews. I truly enjoy reading this. I just began chapter two and this book makes a great supplement to my Rosetta Stone training."
1,No props for Fante,"If you are interested in reading a fairly non-dimensional story whose main character is a pedantic, shiftless, word-spewing [person] living life in a tin can, then this is the perfect book for you. I tried on several occasions to read Fante in light of Bukowski's praise. Comparatively, the writing is less authentic, postured and less than marginally vivifying. The repetitive contrivance of any dialogue involving the main character (Arturo) becomes inherently annoying as he launches into bombastic phraseology where other characters are mere sounding boards. In short, stick to Buk."
3,Kind of long and drawn out,I did like portions of this book but I felt like it took forever to get to the point. I just couldn't give it the 5 stars that so many others did.
5,Best Book I Have Ever Read!,"I LOVED this book!! Every time I read I get sad when the end comes because I want the story to keep going! I love the way she developed the characters, they were so life like. I feel like I personal know Benny and Eve. I would personally recommend this book to anyone!!"
1,Not Happy,First off it is plastic! Secondly it arrived with only one side rail attachment as opposed to two (one for each side of the Cx4)!
4,Viking Modem - Not Bad,"Having never tried the Viking brand before, I was pleasently surprised. Good, stable, fast connections."
4,No/No original bird feeder,"I purchased this feeder after squirrels destroyed a wooden feeder I was using to dispense sunflower seed. It's attractive and seems very durable, and while it doesn't keep squirrels from feeding, it's unlikely they can damage it. I like that the mesh design allows birds like chicadees to perch on the side instead of on the ring. And it holds a good amount of sunflower seed, so I'm not having to refill it every day or two. The one gripe I have is that the perch ring seems too close to the feeder, making it hard for cardinals to feed. They do use it, but only with a lot of wing flapping to keep their balance."
4,Works very well,"I was afraid this feeder wasn't going to do for me, because I have to bring feeders in at night to foil raccoons. Since this one is collapsible, I thought the seed would go all over the place when I moved it. It doesn't.This feeder wouldn't work with all tiny seeds, though. They'd go right through, even if you didn't move the feeder. I'm using a mix that contains a fair percentage of sunflower seed."
5,Brilliant Basics Ready Steady Rider,"Brilliant Basics Ready Steady RiderI brought this bike for my Little Granddaughter for Christmas, she lives in Ireland and I had it shipped over, she was a year and 8 months, this bike is perfect as a ""First"" bike for boy or Girl, it is not fancy and does not have all these whistles and bells that some bikes on the market have but it is perfect for a toddler learning to ride a bike for the first time, it has 4 sturdy wheels instead of the normal 3, and is very strong and the seat is a great size so the baby doesn't fall off as much, I think it is a great toy, and a good price and one that will last until they are at least 3 years old. Happy Grandmother"
5,Cute little bike!,"I bought this bike for my daughter for Christmas. She loves it. She doesn't know how to ride it yet, but she does sit on it. She knows how to honk the horn and use the cup holder already. She also puts stuff in the basket and pushes the bike around."
4,steady rider,This is a safe toy for wee ones. I purchased it for my 1 year old grandson and he is so cute getting on and off by himself. It is sturdy and he swings his little leg over it just like the big guys do on on their bikes.
1,Bad,"Mr. Bruinius seems undecided as to whether he wants to write a serious book or a thriller, and the result is a muddy potboiler wannabe. I didn't even finish it. By page 142 I had enough."
4,Entertaining,"We used this book for one semester when I was in the graduate school. This is one of the computer science related books that actually have enough substance to have some intellectual value.I found this volume entertaining years after leaving graduate school and working in the industry as an engineer. The topics addressed in this book is actually quite intriguing--the best time to reduce programming complexity is before one actually programs. I believe any serious programmer should be able to estimate the complexity, both space and time, on the algorithm he is designing.In the real world, one does not encounter nontrivial algorithms very often, and from a practical perspective, this books is not quite useful.However, when you really get bored, this is something that could entertain your brain a little."
5,Awesome CHOCOATES!!!!,"The seller sent me the 48 ct. box of ferrero rocher candies, and i receive them all intact!!! No worries- It was for my parents wedding anniversary!!!"
2,"Fair book, not great","Fair Play is my first book i've read by Deirdre Martin and i've got to say i am not really impressed with her work. I thought the hockey theme was fine and i thought the dialogue was funny, but i just didn't feel for Theresa. I thought Michael was a nice guy and she just kept stringing him along. So i can see why he got mad at her for doing it. I thought he could have did better. I don't know if i want to read any of the other hockey books. Maybe i should read the first and see. I just didn't find this book all that romantic, i found that i was bored within chapter two and i skimmed the rest of the book just to get through it. I thought she had too many characters in the book and not enough of the main characters in order for their love to be believable. But i will give her a second chance and see if the first book is better than this one."
5,Repeat winner,"Fair Play is even better than Body Check! The action and romance are still great and Michael and Theresa are even more believable, real life characters than Ty and Janna from the first book. This was another page turner. I just hope Deirdre brings Michael, Theresa and especially Anthony back in her next book."
1,The eagle of the Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz....................,"The title explains it........You see, we all were told to choose a book to do a review on and i chose this- what a mistake.In my beliefe this book puts you off reading anything ever again, i mean who wants to read about some random Roman guy whos going to find his father, who knows he is dead!Whats the point? Sutcliffe made it worse by talking about irrelevant and pointless things .If you like historical things then fine read it but to be honest i suggest no-one reads it unless their forced to or just like being bored. Kat"
2,Dull at best,"This is without a doubt the dullest book about ""Rome"" I have ever read, I had to force myself to read it, the plot, thin, never catches fire, the characters are not too bad, but what they did just was, well, nothing to shout about, I can see why the movie was changed, it had some action, well then I find out it is a ""young persons"" book, good luck ""young"" person, I hope you like it, I didn't."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"A decent adventure story, designed to be accessible to younger readers.At times, Sutcliff is tedious, which can be a definite problem in thissort of story, so you suffer when reading her books because of that.A young Roman officer has to find out what happened to the standard of the Lost Legion, for military reasons."
4,eagle of the ninth,"When I was a teenager, this was one of my favorite books. It was a wonderful introduction to Roman history, a subject I have loved ever since. Sutcliff had a marvelous gift for bringing the distant past alive, and I am delighted to be able to add this dear old friend to my personal library."
4,"Satisfying read, even for an adult","This book is skillfully done in many ways. The story is smooth and the pacing good. There are several exciting and suspenseful parts. If you are an adult you might think of this as chocolate ice cream rather than double fudge macadamia crunch. Good, but not overly complex.One of the reviewers imagines some kind of wrong relationship between a 20 something man and a 13 year old girl. If anything like that is implied, it must be awful subtle because I didn't see it. Anyway, in ancient times it wasn't unusual for girls as young as 13 to get married. When average life expectancies were in their 30's, you had to start families young."
3,Might have been new at one time,"This book shows fundamentals and a few stitch patterns. Most of it is paragraphs that try to talk you through the fundamental patterns. A few subjects are approaches such as how to block the end product. However there is no way to get form the fundamental stitches to the finished products displayed.425 illustrations, 12 color plates, with 80 different stitches"
5,Great Movie!,What can I say that has not been said about this film other than it is worth watching again and again.
3,"Great movie, but beware the blu-ray","I've loved this movie, and I have the DVD version. But I recently borrowed the BluRay from Netflix and noticed how grainy the picture is. Nothing especially bad, but it should be better than DVD, but it's not. I have a 1080p, 48-inch Samsung high-def TV, and my other Blu-ray movies have great picture quality, but this blu-ray version of ""Wolf"" is even more grainy than my DVD. What gives? And the lack of any ""Special Features"" makes this Blu-ray pointless. The transfer to Blu-ray was not well done."
3,Dreadful score,"This movie would have been a lot better, considering the cast and director, but that the music score is horrendously schlocky and over done. It sounds like the score of a bad Mexican horror film. What a shame. Spader (always an interesting actor) and Nicholson make fine werewolves however."
4,Classic Horror,"I love this movie. It's just as good as the first time I saw it, everyone should own it. The picture and sound are much better than the old vhs which makes watching it fun."
3,"Quick data transfer, but beware...","Very quick transfer from all manufacturers of cards. Be careful with removing the card too early, although the red data light goes out, you may get severe errors with Windows Explorer (not IE). Best to just leave the card in there a while after you transfer any data."
1,Be Careful,Compatability is a Big Issue here. This product is essentially useless on my Canon Powershot A20. I think others may have similar problems.
1,Didn't work for me!,"My system met all the requirements for the Intelliflash card reader. I loaded the software and re-started my system as directed. Once I plugged the card reader into my USB hub, all the device drivers appeared to load without a problem. I then attempted to read a CF card from the reader. I don't know why, but my screen (graphics) went crazy and I got a windows protection error. I called Viking and they said it must be a system incompatibility but they couldn't tell me why. I had to boot into safe mode and remove the devices before my system (windows 98)would reboot. I am packing it up and returning it!"
1,Windows ME users beware!,"I installed the software as described, and all seemed well until I tried to read my first CF card. After downloading, I ejected the card, burning my fingers in the process! Upon reviewing the results of the download, I discovered that a number of the pictures did not transfer and were no longer on the CF card. When I called Viking, they informed me that they did not advertise their unit as working with Windows ME -- obviously my mistake. When I asked how this could cause the obvious overheating, they could not give an answer -- but more troubling -- they didn't seem to care! When I have a chance, I will retry with another computer with Windows 98 before I pack it up and send it back."
2,Dora comes ....and goes.........,My daughter loves Dora and I thought this was cute idea. Well within the few minutes you turn on the water hoes it exploded. That was it for this dora toy.
3,Dora Jump & Splash,"It's cute & my daughter liked it but, it WAS ALOT SMALLER than it lead me to believe."
4,I found this suspenseful tale of love delightful.,"I really enjoy this series. I found the characters intrigueing. The other worldly characters of the elves fascinated me. The plot is interesting. The manner in which she writes is enticing. I would highly recommend this book. You also might try ""The Other Side of The sun"" by Madeleine L'engle."
4,"Perfect, except for all the breast pump adapters.....","This is a great and easy to use storage set, I love how easy it is to just screw right onto the nurser. The only drawback is all the breat pump adapters I've ended up with. I needed lots of these to be able to store enough of a backup supply, and I've ended up with 6 adapters, when I only need 2. I wish you could just buy the rings separately."
2,Playtex Doesn't Sell Storage Parts Seperately,I have decided to use the Playtex Nurser which has become a big investment for me since Playtex does not sell the sealing discs seperately. You need the sealing discs to store the milk in the freezer with the Playtex drop-in liners. The only way to purchase the sealing discs is to purchase the entire storage kit which costs $9.99. Four sealing discs are included in the storage kit. This doesn't make sense when Playtex sells all of the other parts of the storage kit seperately with the exception of the sealing discs.
3,One star for the features and 2stars for Elvira.,"I was unable to watch Monstroid,due to the fact that the picture was unbearable.'Blue Sunshine on the other hand looked good visually and was okay to watch once with Elvira's help.The only bad thing(besides the double feature;LOL) was the fact that Elvira is only shown at the parts where the commercials would come in.Missing is where she would interupt during the movie from time to time with her comments and gestures.) I was a bit dissapointed that they left this out on the dvd.Causing me to leave a star out for this.Buy only if you have a thing for Elvira like I do,then it's worth spending [...] bucks.I found this dvd here on amazon for under 3 dollars plus shipping.If I can find the others for the same amount I'm getting those too.Otherwise not worth it,even if you love Elvira.If they hadn't cut out some of her comments during ,these features would have been better."
3,Insufficient Maps,Unlike other Frommer guides ( e.g. Hong Kong) there is no complete map of the city. There are sections of the city which are mapped but even these seem incomplete. I haven't been to Shanghai yet to comment on other aspects of the guide.
1,way overpriced,You must be kidding to charge 16.56 for 10 packs of gum? This costs like 3.00 total in the store. Unreal. Not worth it.
1,Sooooo boring!,"This is one the most boring albums ever! Uninteresting beats, weak melodies, tiring vocals... I'm really disappointed! David Guetta used to be one the hottest and best producers, and it's a shame he has no inspiration left."
1,Ignorance is bliss...,"This book is, in a nutshell, a piece of garbage. The author takes personal bias to a whole new level (of course I guess I'm just biased the other way). No doubt her examples have some basis in fact, but they represent exaggerated worst case scenarios. If you want more level-headed (and accurate) advice on piercing and tattoos, go to a REPUTABLE piercer or tattoo artist. If you enjoy fear-mongering and misinformation, by all means, buy this book. For every horror story this woman dredges up, there are countless good experiences that do not result in scars and various social traumas. On a more positive note, this book fully deserves the full 1 star because it made me laugh so darn hard. The author's next offering may be ""Everything You Need to Know about the Dangers of Fruit and Vegetables"", telling stories of how some kid poked out his eye with a carrot."
2,Dan Tien light,"This book is a nice description of a centered way of life, and a way of bringing mind and body into synchronization. However, it says nothing about the TanDien other than it's your belly and you should listen to it. On the whole disappointing, yet like many spiritual books, full of wisdom."
2,Love the intent...but falls short.,"What I found frustrating about this book were the seemingly unrelated tangents that felt more like opportunities for the author to make opinion statements about other topics than they were related to the theme of the book. I appreciate the author's willingness and enthusiasm but to me there was a lack of depth, understanding and maturity. For a much deeper treatment on the subject I would recommend Karlfried Graf Duerckheim's works. Also, it would have been helpful to have more specific methods discussed. Bottom line: disappointing read, but enjoyed the author's enthusiasm and good intent. Refreshing to have any western author discuss Hara/Dan Tien. Bravo for the attempt but would not recommend for serious student."
5,Works great video card to LCD monitor,"The cord is very heavy and solid. My previous DVI cable stopped working and I was stuck using a VGA cable until I received this, and upon hooking it up immediately was awed by the finer resolution on my LCD screen. Very pleased."
5,Legolas is adorible!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,i loved lord of the rings and i love Legolas/Orlando Bloomthis toy show perfect perfectness i mean everything on him is detailed.The poor guy even has to stand the torment of my school locker in which he waits. But out of all my action figures he shows the most detail i mean sure gandalf's outfit has detail but not as much as my legolas action figure!!!!!!! you would think a wizard made him!!!! toybiz did such a good job he seems so real!!!!! the only problem is he is on such high demand !!! i had to wait awhile until i finally got mine. the ONLY two thing about him that bugs me is 1.HE ISN'T REAL 2. this isn't too bad it just can be strange at times like all the other action figures his hair is in the windblown state!! oh well anyway you must buy this toy it is the best you won't be sorry!!!!!!I LOVE YOU LEGOLAS
5,I Get Chills...,"Everytime I listen to Kat sing Somewhere Over The Rainbow, I get chills . It has been like this from the first time I heard Kathatine sing it on American Idol. Katharine's voice is so angelic and prue. My Destiny is bound to be a huge hit, also."
2,A FAIR FIRST CD FROM A AMERICAN IDOL,"There's not alot to say about this lackluster cd. I'm not a katharine mcphee fan so maybe that has alittle to do with this. I find both songs boring.My destiny and Some Where Over The Rainbow are forgetable. To me Katharine shines when the songs and the arrangments are very good. She in my opinion can not take a fair song and make it a good one. Whitney could, Mariah could, but in my opinion Katharine can not and thats what needs to happen on this cd. My Destiny is not a good song and Some Where Over The Rainbow is an old song past it's time. I would say that for her next cd I would start by giving her some well written material. I would pass on this."
2,Good voice dull songs,Kathranine Mcphee has a nice voice. She will do ok in the music world but is up against some stiff competion> What I don't find worth buying is that My Destiny is a dull typical AI single nothing special and unlike Taylor hicks who can take a dull song and make it special. Katharine can not. That doesn't mean her cd when it comes out will be the same. time will tell. Some Where Over The Rainbow comes off much better live. It was refreshing on AI when it was done live. Done in the studio it's just another dull ballad. Both songs need some spark. Let's hope when her cd comes out the spark is there or there's no sense in buying it. There are too many good female singers out there. Wish I could have given her a better rating. Wait for the full cd to come out.
5,Mc-ceeding expectations,"As a lifelong vocalist, I was impressed with Katharine McPhee during the American Idol competition and had high expectations for her single release. It does not disappoint! Her lyrical and expressive voice is solid throughout both cuts, and is well worth the small purchase price if you have an interest in ""good"" music. I expect this young woman to produce an exceptional full length album later this year, and will anxiously await it's release."
5,Katharine is AMAZING!!,Katharine McPhee has one of the best voices i have ever heard. This is because her voice is very enjoyable and just sounds great. Taylor Hicks on the other hand might be entertaining but does not have as great of a voice to listen to as Katharine.Somewhere Over the Rainbow was NOT overrated and in my opinion was a little better on the show. It was more impressive because it started off with no one helping her and was just amazing. The single sounds great!My Destiny isnt my favorite song but she made it sound like an incredible song because of her vocal abilities.Overall she has an enormous talent and is the perfect idol for anyone with good taste in music. She IS so sweet and IS a nice person and the best Idol contestant ever!!
3,Buy it for Somewhere Over the Rainbow,"Somewhere Over the Rainbow was one of the top performances in the 5 years of American Idol. Katherine has a beautiful voice.But the ""A"" side, My Destiny, is another in a long line of STALE CHEESE from the lame writers hired by the Idol machine. Don't blame Katherine, she got stuck with the song.Imagine Katherine singing a song like Moon River in a style similar to Somewhere Over the Rainbow. If she had performed itduring the Finals competition after Over the Rainbow, she would have won."
2,Weak,"I as hoping for something better after her first CD, and was disappointed. Her selections on ""David Foster and Friends"" were terrific and she needs to use Foster more with original stuff. It was my fault thinking I would hear more than 2-recordings on a CD. Will find it hard to buy the next"
2,Eva Cassidy,"If you think Katherine McPhee's version is the best of ""Over the Rainbow,"" you need to know that she's ""sampling"" Eva Cassidy's rendition. Check out Eva Cassidy's ""Songbird"" to hear her sing it and you'll be amazed at how much better she can sing it. It always makes me cry. Sadly, on the cusp of her success, cancer silenced Eva's voice forever, but we are still blessed with the work she left behind; eleven CDs."
5,bravo,Hey I am a singer myself did recording in the 60s my love was connie francis I loved her voice katharine is going to be great bought 20 copies at walmart gave them out everyone gives her 5 stars boy can this girl sing only 22 yrs old what a future she will be up there with the best cant wait for her album
1,My Destiny Still ISnt Good,UNfortunatly even with studio help My destiny still sounds like shes not singing it right like shes afraid to sing it. She is singing it too low sorry. SOTR is great as usual though.....
1,Pitchy and Overproduced,Overproduced to compensate for weak vocals. She lacks the range and can't hit the high notes. Pitchy Pitchy. Somewhere Over the Rainbow is to big of a song for her. She is no Judy Garland. My Destiny has the worse lyrics. Combine that with her voice and its a no go. A total lack of feeling and emotion in her voice...
2,Kat has some work to do,"I listened to both tracks of this CD numerous times to try to decide if I wanted to buy it. Her rendition of Somewhere Over the Rainbow is more contemporary than the original Judy Garland version and isn't bad, but for me it had too many vocal gymnastics in it. My Destiny was better on the CD than it was sung on the finals of American Idol , especially in the beginning of the song, but by the middle I had to turn it off. Her voice sounded ""too much"" and too loud and it was incredibly annoying to listen to. I think Kat has potential to be a very good artist, but would prefer to see more soulful music from her where she doesn't try to overstretch her vocal range."
5,UNBELIEVABLE!!!,"As a vocalist myself, I can say with all honesty and fairness that Ms. McPhee has one of the best voices I have ever heard. She has GREAT tone quality and strong vocals and there is no dobut that she will go on to do AMAZING things!! This single is a MUST BUY!!!!"
4,A good start...,"OK, let's say it straight away. I have the McPheever. I was rooting for my girl Kat since the beginning of the show. However, I'm trying to make this review as unbiased as possible.1. My Destiny ~ This song is OK... it's a little boring, like others have said before, but from a musician's standpoint, I think that the key is wrong for Kat's voice. While she still sounds great, if the key had been a couple of steps lower, she might have sounded a tad bit better. Also, is the modulation necessary at the end? Come on! 3/5 stars2. Somewhere Over the Rainbow ~ This is a beautifully sung and arranged version of the classic song that propelled Kat to the Final 2. She sang this song very well on AI, and she has changed it up a bit on this arrangment. Her voice sounds very good, and the bluesy kind-of sound does wonderful things for her. 4/5 starsHopefully her album is more of a hitmaker than this single... good luck to her."
5,I love her voice.......!,"She is awesome you guys. ""my destiny"" is a beautiful song. It just rain here and playing ""somewhere over the rainbow"" had me thinkin a storm of memories. I love the good times that me and my friends had together. Katharine has made me enjoy the sweet memories. I love when a singer does that to me......"
4,Katharine McPhee - Some Where Over The Rainbow,I really enjoyed this CD. Some Where Over The Rainbow is one of my all time favorite songs and I love the take Katharine does to make it her own. She has a beautiful voice and conveys such emotion with every note she sings. I would highly recommend this video to other listeners.
5,Sing it girl!,"Kat and Chris Daughtry were my two favorites on American Idol last season. Kat has a beautiful voice and amazing talent! I used to sing Opera and Classical music and have a very fine tuned ear making it easier to pick out the real talent in groups. I am painfully aware that this doesn't always mean they will win though. I believe the only time someone DESERVING won American Idol was in season 1, Kelly Clarkson. I am really looking forward to Kat's CD coming out and plan to buy it."
5,SUPERB!,"Wow... These songs really shows how talented Katharine McPhee is. She has a clean, powerful voice and she did a superb job singing both songs. I love it so much. You won't regret buying this CD."
5,Amazing Artist!!!!!!,Just beautiful! Great vocals! The recorded versions of both of these songs are just awesome!
3,Great idea; not great execution,"My kids were ready to move up from just ""Signing Time"" and other one-word ASL videos, but this one does not teach very well, as the voice interpreting is not lined up with the signing. It would be great for a deaf kid who would just turn the sound off, though."
2,Well Written but irrelevant,"Gordon-Reed's work, while impressive from a research perspective, point sout the basic flaw undergirding most of this politically correct fable about the paterninty of the Hemmings's descendents: no evidence EXISTS to prove that they were Jefferson's. Writing about the controversy between pro- and anti-Jefferson positions -- without acknowledging that one side can not prove its case, while the other is forced into the tortured pose of having to prove a negative, is to miss the crux of the entire debate.Two hundred years after the story first gained circulation, the DNA evidence demonstrated nothing more than had ALWAYS been asserted -- that the Hemmings's children were fathered SOME DESCENDENT in the Jefferson line.Books like Gordon-Reed's only highlight the affliction currently paralyzing much of the historical community: the willingness to ignore facts in favor of a narrative of the way in which we WISHED events had happened."
1,very poor quality material,pages almost as dark as the wrapper in this picture. Book is great. most outstanding introduction to dogmatic theology.I bought this as a gift.........quality of the material ........ bad. Ronald Johnson
4,very inspirational,"This book (along with Locktov/Clagett's ""The Art of Mosaic Design"") is a very fine book to inspire those who make mosaics and those who appreciate them (the mosaics, that is... not the mosaicists -- particularly). Neither are books for the beginner as far as making the projects, but the mosaics can allow you to see what is possible. There is an emphasis on Martin Cheek's own work, that's true, but hey... he's pretty darn good."
4,Very informative book!,"We are thinking about moving to Hawaii, and this book was very helpful in doing away with some of the myths, but yet making it all sound worthwhile. It gave the pluses and the minuses-and wasn't just a bunch of statistics like some other literature we have received on the same subject. Very good book!"
3,island justice,"This book is great in the reality check factor. I have lived in Hawaii and thought the crime and prejudice section was soft!!!!I would have made it even more clear. You can get your ass kicked, and everything stolen faster then you can say Aloha.The locals dont want you there, you have to earn your place, unless you offer a service they need like medical. I saw a local follow a senior citizen across the island and wait for him to stop at which time the local punched out the senior, for flipping him off. The grey haired mainlander got a wake up call on island justice.All the big deal ego life you have in your hometown means nothing in Hawaii. The Hawaiians will decide if your legite real fast. they dont care what you used to be."
3,Not bad,A good movie to watch during those veg-out nights. Didn't like the ending though. It felt like it left one hanging.
3,"Decent intro, but lacking coverage","Rule's book is a great introduction to -doing- DHTML. He has lots of stuff to get you started; this is a learn-by-example book. Unfortunately I found that the examples were alternately superficial or not fully explained. His so-called pull down menu is a click pop up <div>, and he does things like present ""how to"" for text mouse-overs in Netscape without much explanation. This book will get you secure in your ability to do things like graphics swaps and animations, but doesn't get you into much depth. Very easy to read though... I read half of the book in an afternoon. Spend an evening reading this book in the bookstore and then buy something like _Dynamic HTML: The Definitive Reference_ (O'Reilly; Goodman)."
1,A dead-end place to start.,"It takes about 30mins to go through the examples in the book. There's not enough information with the examples (and the book has only about 8 examples)... and the links to additional information and online examples seem to all be broken (leading to dead ends). This is very frustrating. You'll do better to just look up a few good DHTML web pages rather than spend money on this book. I don't write reviews often, just when the book is extremely good or extremely bad. This one is extremely bad."
2,Full of theory without adequate life stories,"This book is a little bit dry. big theories shadow the inadequate narratives about the subject. Especially, the Daoist analaysis does not make sense for me. Follow Chan's logic, everyone could be a Daoist, at least at certain moment of your life. Wish the author got deeper in his research.It seems that Chan befriended Wong's surviving brother, why have not any oral materials through interviews been included?"
2,Loud but REALLY CRAPPY SOUND!,"These speakers were true ghetto-blasters for your head. They pumped out some serious sound, and with independent volume controls, I was pretty stoked.No sooner did I put them on my head and turn it up, did I take them off and put them back in the box. These things were complete junk. If you have any appreciation for music quality, ranges, frequencies, and pitches-- DO NOT BUY THESE HEADPHONES!If you are unemployed however and need a loud sound, go right ahead. You get what you pay for, and with the cost of these, do not expect much. You've been warned."
1,Liver Failure,"There is very little details provided on any of the kava kava root products, but all I wanted was to find a root only extract. Kava kava made from the entire plant is what caused the liver failure issue a few years back.This seemed like a good buy despite the lack of info, until it finally arrived a month later and it plainly says on the bottle in small print ""whole plant"". That being said, it's also not even what I've seen from extracts, it smells like rubbing alcohol and in fact is 75% alcohol.Of course it will calm you down, the recommended dose is the same as taking a shot. Find another source for your kava kava, don't waste your money here."
1,POS handle,"if you buy this broom plan to purchase a new handle right away.. it's flimsy and feels like it will break at any second. brush head seems fine, but without a handle it doesn't really matter. take a pass on this one and save yourself some aggravation."
4,good natural fiber place matts,Good quality inexpensive natural material place matts. They have held up wall and clean up well with a sponge & a little dish soap. Much nicer than plastic and less trouble than cloth.
4,This is as PURE AS IT GETZ,"I just can't believe that I am the first person to review an album issued in 1982. And frankly, post-bop standards don't come any better than this. Yes, there are a few ""Samba"" and latin collaborations that this artist is better recognized for. But this one doesn't take the back seat to any of those in any way. The combo of McNeely(piano)/Johnson(bass)/Hart or Lewis (drums) form a perfect (read well stretched) canvas for Mr.Getz to paint on. ""Tempus Fugit"" swings with passion. ""Blood Count"" showcases the (controlled) lyrical ability of Stan's horn. It's tough to pick out a bad track on this album.For me, this is Getz at his best. Anyone who likes jazz standards played at the highest level of quality, this is a must for your collection."
5,NATIVE AMERICAN ZELDA OCARINA OF TIME,"GREAT GAME LUSH BEAUTIFUL GRAPHICS BUT DID NOT PUSH PS2 LIMITS BUT THATS OK. NOT TOO HARD AND GOOD FOR YOUNGER GAMERS OR PEOPLE WHO DONT HAVE TOO MUCH TIME TO DEVOTE TO A 3 DAY ADVENTURE.GAME REMINDED ME OF OCARINA OF TIME BUT WITH BETTER GRAPHICS.ALSO PLAYED LIKE THE HOBBIT PLATFORMER TO SOME EXTENT.DI NOT NOTE TOO MUCH THAT WOULD OFFEND NATIVE AMERICAN CULTURE.BASICALLY THIS COULD BE A GREAT CARTOON TOO.SURPRISED NO ONE THOUGHT TO DO IT.OVERALL NOT TOO HARD AND VIBRANT COLORS,GOOD CONTROLS VOICE ACTING OK GAME DURATION ONLY A FEW HOURS SO IF YOU ONLY HAVE THAT YOU MIGHT LIKE THIS TO FEEL LIKE YOU GOT SOMETHING COMPLETED."
3,Somewhat scoffy,"The content of the book is satisfactory and average as far as its information and class are concerned. But even this is diminished, because it is written in an irresponsible, scoffy style (so typically ""New World"" American, I suppose) that it is guaranteed to make you a dummy instead of the other way around."
3,A bit too sardonic???,"I basically enjoy the ""Dummies"" books... I find the information often extremely insightful and helpful. It also is a great pleasure to order the books through amazon.com and be spared the 'embarrassment' of having to march up to the local bookstore counter with a ""Dummies"" book in tow. That being said, this book at times seems painfully silly. Although obviously now somewhat dated, comparing Paganini to ""Saddam Hussein,"" Vivaldi to a ""Xerox machine,"" and commenting that without Beethoven, ""we'd have no Barry Manilow,"" are just a few examples of pithy comments from the authors. Of course, the basic aim of these books is to be entertaining and to reach out to individuals. The book is funny and perhaps needs to be given the fact that most people approach the subject with a lot of trepidation and a readiness to be bored out of their minds. However, fewer sarcastic remarks and far reaching attempts to be 'humorous' is something this book could do without."
1,"Smells Great, Not Worth the Price.","This product comes cleverly marketed. Very Cute, my daughter loves it. But for $30.00, get serious!The miniscule amount of product you actually receive really smells great, but in reality $30.00for a couple tablespoons of scented powder....not again.Just noticed, price was lowered to $11.19 from original price of $30.00."
1,Very disappointing.,"I used to love Nine Inch Nails. The music used to be industrial and intriguing. Now I wouldn't be surprised to hear it on a Nintendo or Sony Playstation soundtrack (with the lyrics taken out, of course). It's all soft and gooshy guitar-strumming plus Trent yelling about things which don't even make sense anymore. Can you believe this guy is in his mid-thirties? The only GOOD thing about ""The Day the Whole World Died"" is the last five minutes of the third track. The piano stuff is really nice. This is part of what I referred to as gooshiness before, but honestly, it's the only part of the album worth listening to, simply on the basis of its being pretty, because it's not the kind of thing I want to hear from NIN. I'll listen to Mozart and Mahler if I want pretty."
4,Cd Definatly Worth Buying,"I got this cd july 20 and it is an excellent cd because its cheap 3 great songs and its just nice to have. Check out my Review of the songs Below!The day the world went away = Mellow and depressing, nice beats, true nine inch nails.Starf***ers, INC = Great song perfect length and has excellent beats, this is the most fast paced song on the cd.The day the world went away (quiet) = Great song trent really preforms in this one; All these songs are great, & dont ask me my favorite song because i dont know!Also the ""broken"" style cd case is welll composed and has a great cover... i guess the world may never know what the ""hidden picture"" behind the cd is...maybe trent doesnt want to know, because sometimes its fun to wonder."
5,Modern Music in Ancient Terms,"I recieved a package from the US yesterday. Like a small child, I rushed home in order to open it. Unpacking was a ritual in itself. I washed my hands and face and slowly absorbed the package before finally uncovering its treasures. There it was. I placed it into the CD player and waited. Four minutes later, I understood why religion works for so many people. I closed my eyes and envisaged myself standing in front of an ancient temple, with my arms raised to the sky. It is usually Pythagoras who is accredited to the philosophy of music and its harmony with the universe. However, academics feel that it goes back further, even beyond the Babylonians. What am I trying to say? I'm trying to explain why NIN works so much more than anything else. Reznor has the power to tap that force. It just sounds RIGHT. As the Hell's Angels said, ""If I had to explain, you wouldn't understand."""
4,Wonderful,"Well, i've been waiting for a long time for trent to release something...and so when this single came out i couldn't wait to grab it.....and lo and behold trent has done it again.....this is a refreshing mix of different instruments, very good i must say......u like nin then u'll love this..."
3,Only for collectors,"I'd recommend this single only to collectors of halos. Of the three tracks, two can be found on the Fragile and the other version of The day the world went away isn't anything too spectacular. I'm not saying this is a bad c.d, I'm just saying if you're not a collector your money would be better spent on elsewhere."
2,After 5 years this is the best Trent can do?,"Does anyone else get the feeling that Trent is repeating himself? ""The Day The World Went Away"" sounds an awful lot like ""Something I Can Never Have"" to me while ""Starfuckers Inc."" sounds a lot like ""March of the Pigs"". I don't want to say that Trent has gone on a ""Downward Spiral"" until I hear the entire ""Fragile"" album. I just hope these 2 songs are the worst tracks on the album."
5,"Funny Shirt, Well Loved","My college grad loved this shirt. After a senior year that was exhausting and then some, it was more than appropriate. He gets a lot of laughs when he wears this one."
1,Don't Bother,"The book is very misleading. On the outside it appears to have several pages of popups, but on opening the book, there are several illustrations, but only one popup scene of the entire cantina. The author should have given the reader several diffirent popup scenes."
1,How In The Heck Can Anybody Like This?,"How in the heck, can anybody like this? I just heard a couple of songs on the radio, and the they were horrible! He sounds like a little girl. if you're looking for good music, look past this because you're not going to find any here."
3,Pleasant.,"Excuse Me Miss, Run It, Say Goodbye, Poppin' and Ain't No Way (You Won't Love Me) are the standouts.Thank You and Run It (Remix) are stupid crappy songs and should have stopped filling the disc with pointless drivel.Anyway, this CD is decent fun. It is primarily Hip-Hop and R&B-fused; production and there are some ballads present.Chris is a decent singer but now he needs to start writing more of his hits. He will be big in the future though. Just wait and see!3.5 stars."
1,Where all the men?,"Chris Brown sounds like a girl when he sings. Yes, I know he's only 16, but he sounds like a 16 year-old GIRL when he sings. I swear, until I checked out this album, I thought the ""Run It"" song was sung by a female. What happened to masculinity in R&B? Even Michael Jackson and Ralph Tresvant never sounded like a girl when they sang; they sounded like young boys singing. Chris Brown needs a healthy dose of testosterone. If he's the new face of R&B, then I'll stick to my old album collection."
5,The Cd is HOTT!!,"I love this CD! My fav. are Winner, is this love, poppin and every other song on the CD. I cant wait for the next one!"
5,Chris Brown,"I love his cd.My fav songs are Young Love,Run It Remix Fea Bow Wow.The other songs are good too.I know his cd will be number one"
5,Hott Hott Hott,"Chris brown's album iz bangin. Every song iz hott. his voice iz amazing.It's the type of album that you can listen to all the way through without skipping a song.It has party songs, love songs, up-tempos, and slow songs. It is a well put together cd and i recommend this cd for anyone who likes r&b & hip-hop music.This has to be the best cd of 2005 in my opinion.Chris Brown has an amazing talent.EVERYONE NEEDS TO GO OUT AND BUY THIS CD AND SUPPORT CHRIS BROWN CAUSE HE'S HOTT!!!!!!"
3,Pleasant. But this contains no new tracks. Don't even be fooled.,"Excuse Me Miss, Run It, Say Goodbye, Poppin' and Ain't No Way (You Won't Love Me) are the standouts.Thank You and Run It (Remix) are stupid crappy songs and should have stopped filling the disc with pointless drivel.Anyway, this CD is decent fun. It is primarily Hip-Hop and R&B-fused; production and there are some ballads present.Chris is a decent singer but now he needs to start writing some of his hits. He will be big in the future though. Just wait and see!3.5 stars."
1,Really?,The only reason why i have this album on my ipod is because my friend burned me a copy. it wasn't even worth it as a freebie.
5,"""THAT BOY KNOW HE GOOD!!!""","TO EVERYBODY IN THE WORLD, GO OUT THERE AND GET THAT NEW CHRIS BROWN ALBUM CAUSE ITS HOT TO DEF. EVERY TRACK UP THERE IS A DANCE TRACK AND HE AIN'T UP THERE BEGGING ON HIS SONGS LIKE MOST OF THE YOUNG BOYS OUT THERE ARE DOING. ITS A HOT ALBUM!!!"
5,Amazing!,"I just finished reading this book and I loved it so much that I can't wait to read it again. I found this in a bookstore when I was having a very difficult week with my children. The title caught me right away, but as I opened the book to a random page to check it out, I was blown away at how that particular page related to what I was going though at that moment. Not a coincidence. The chapters are short and managable for a busy mom, but the message is BIG. I used it as a daily devotional, and it put me back on track to appreciating my blessings!"
3,Last Man Standing - W.London,"This book is a little disappointing for me. I've been a fan of Baldacci since a few years. I've read Total Control, Brethren, Wish you well and The Winner. If you're familiar with Baldacci and expect something out of the usual then this is the book but unfortunately I find the story to be illogical and the facts are being supplied and the explanation a little to ""amazing"" for me to believe in. If you're a big fan, pick the book with a discount as I did (20% off). If you're new with Baldacci definitely you should pick his early and better titles.The Winner would rate 5 stars and Total Control as well. Brethren would be 4 stars and This last book would be around 2.5 to 3 stars. =)"
2,"Big book, big disappointment","Superhero stuff centered totally around one character. The author tries to make him more than one dimensional by putting him in therapy. Shades of ""The Sopranos"". Some books you enjoy and think they would make a great movie. This just seems to be written for the movies and not a very good one at that. It's Bruce Willis or Arnold Schwarzenegger territory. Not up to Baldacci's best. I should have given up after the first few chapters. As an American living overseas, I'm afraid the most enjoyable parts of the book were the descriptions of my native Virginia."
3,Nothing special.,"Nothing special and a little disappointing because there were no surprising twists. Not his best work. I expected the story would be similar to the movie by this name but it was a totally different story. Long, long, long audio book...and the second last tape was defective and I had to get a replacement from Amazon, which was very annoying."
2,Is it Baldacci or Baldacci as ghost writer?,"I usually love Baldacci. This one was worth skipping. It was disconnected (except by far too frequent ""oh, by the way"" fill-ins) and seemed, in fact, to have been patched-together by an inexperienced author, a poor stylist, and an overworked editor. The final acknowledgment to an FBI hostage rescue team operator and would-be writer may tell the tale. Baldacci wishes him every success in his writing career. So do I -- but I hope Baldacci rediscovers his muse."
3,Book for the boys,Too much focus on weapons and male egos. This book is aimed at boys and their toys. The story line was a bit drawn out.
2,Hoping things would pick up,"He had my full attention at the start, but once the investigation started I kept hoping with each new chapter that the book was going to get better. The ending was good but the bulk of this book was just filler."
1,Don't Waste Your Time,"This review relates to the audio version of Last Man Standing. I listened to 22 hours of this book only find it had the worst ending ever. The budding romance that had been developing throughout the book, even up to the last chapters, died so suddenly that I was sure there was more to come, until the reader's next words were, ""The End."" It was as if David Baldacci got tired of writing this book and decided to finish it off quickly. This was my first attempt at a David Baldacci and I think it will be a long time before I get the courage up to read/listen to another. My sympathies to anyone currently listening to this story."
3,Last Man Standing,This very long novel seems to be both a different style than Baldacci usually writes and also not as good as most of his other books. My favorite part involved the interaction between the female psychiatrist and the surviving agent.
2,Not up to his standards,I have read and enjoyed most of Baldacci's books. This one was so contrived that the ending was a little tough to get to. So many twists and turns that I think even he got lost.
1,Couldn't 'Stand' any more! (1.5 stars),"My first(and probably last) David Baldacci novel. I gave it an extra half a star for at least starting off well, with an interesting premise, and some believable action scenes and character motives. Then, apparently Baldacci took a long lunch, and let that room full of monkeys bang away on typewriters until they'd finished the story!Way too many characters, subplots and 'Bet you thought we'd forgotten about THIS!'-style twists and revelations tacked onto the end of the story. Most of the characters and their dialogue, are corny and forgettable. By the time I reached the end, I just didn't care how any of it fit together.The guy who suggested that anyone who likes this book should try reading Harlan Coben was insulting Harlan Coben. As cliched as Coben's books are, Baldacci surpasses him in stilted prose, and stale cliches."
3,Hummm...,"Okay, this is an interesting book. I looked forward to buying it for a long time (my library never had it). When I finally bought it, I read three or four pages and got disappointed in how boring it seemed. Routines and SOP and blah blah blah. I put it aside and moved on.I reluctantly came back to it and enjoyed it... until the pointless horse ranch interlude. It took way too much time and took me out of the story. Then, it started to get better again. And the whole thing is ruined in the last chapter by one of the worst endings I've ever read.So it's an okay book, but I wish I'd waited for it from the library."
4,"Sheryl, Much love to you...","Always have loved her music and attitude, but for the life of me I can't figure out how she 'perfectly' penned a song that sounds exactly like a Glenn Tilbrook/Chris Difford of Squeeze composition in her ""My Perfect Mistake"".Now, more than anything I wish they would reunite and cover her song.(a compliment to Sheryl)"
2,Major Disappointment,"I loved her Tuesday Night Music Club, and I eventually grew to love her self-titled album, but this is... smurf drivel. I am exceptionally disappointed with the CD. Everything sounds washed out. Some of the lyrics are nearly as nonsenical as the ones on the new Alanis Morisette CD. <shrug>If you liked ""Favorite Mistake,"" beware. It's the best of the bunch, by far."
4,Much better than Rockin The Globe!,This DTS release of The Globe Sessions sounds wonderful and fills the room with sound the way I wish Rockin the Globe on DVD would have done. The insturments and background vocals float through the room while sheryl's vocals come powerfully through the center channel. If you are a fan of Sheryl Crow you cannot miss out on this one. I just wish it had been released sooner!!
1,Not a Sheryl Crow fan after this CD,Bought a few CDs that have the 5.1 capacity for my car. This was not one of my favorites...guess I am not a SC fan.
1,Another artist gouging the fans....,"Well, this re-issue with ""Sweet Child of Mine"" on it is nice, except for those of use who bought the album already without that song on it! Let's see, fans are supposed to shell out more money to to pick up a copy with this ""bone-us"" track on it. So, Sheryl now joins the ranks of artists reselling the same songs over and over again to loyal fans by adding a ""bonus"" track. Shame on you Sheryl Crow."
1,disappointing,"I play her self titled 2nd album over and over & never get tired of it, it's that good. That being said, I was completely disappointed by this album. All the songs are uninteresting and forgettable. Save your money & wait for a (hopefully) better next album."
4,Top to bottom - Sheryl most solid effort to date,"Some songs on her other three studio albums (Tuesday Night Music Club, Sheryl Crow and C'Mon, C'Mon) are outstanding. But the greatest thing I can say about this album is that is doesn't have any low points. From ""My Favorite Mistake"" to ""Crash and Burn"", each song stands out in its own way. This is one of those albums that each time you listen to it, you pick out a new favorite song.Don't pay attention to the ""professional"" reviewers above - this CD should be in your collection."
5,The best album to date by Sheryl Crow!,"This is the best thing that Sheryl Crow has done, and ""Sheryl Crow"" the album would be hard to top! Does anyone else out there think that ""The Difficult Kind"" is the best song on the album? It's just great! ""Crash and Burn"", ""My Favorite Mistake""!!!!!!!!!!!! IT'S ALL GOOD!!! I have been a Sheryl fan for about three years now and she never fails to surprise me."
3,NOT HER BEST WORK,"I THINK SHERYL'S GREAT AND I'D BUY ANYTHING SHE WROTE AND NEVER EXPECT TO BE SO LOST IN HER MUSIC THAT HAS ALWAYS TOUCHED MY HEART. THIS CD REALLY IS NOTHING LIKE HER OTHER WORK I THOUGHT SOMEONE WROTE IT FOR HER. SAVE THE MONEY, BUY THE SINGLE AND PRAY THAT SHE CAN GET SOME REST AND LIVE UP TO HER POTENTIAL. I THINK WE'LL ALL WAIT IF WE'LL GET THAT GREATNESS SHE USUALLY GIVES US."
4,Sheryl Crow is a great guitarist,Ithink Sheryl could be one of the best all around musicians ever to go down the pike. She plays a beautiful guitar and has an astonishing voice and watching her on mtv gives me a feeling I just cant describe if you know what i mean. That song my favorite mistake I can listen to forever and never get tired of it. And I hear that she is going out with Eric Clapton those two together could make a great album I wish them the best. As far as the album it was great and I hope she can have continued sucess in the music field. She is truly one of a kind.b
5,One of rock's most gifted stars.,The Artist Formerly Know As...recently praised Crow and he's right. She works hard and well and is making music that will endure long after her naysayers and bystanders are forgotten. This record is extraordinary and gets even better the more you listen.
5,WOW DAM GOOD,"This SACD is great, the sound is fabulous. It's Like hearing these songs for the first time. Just understand you need an SACD player to use this CD."
1,Don't Buy It Unless....,"EGR 563011 WindowVisor Dark Smoke 2-Piece In-Channel Tapeless Window VisorsThis product did not come close to fitting my 1995 Ford Explorer. The product details relates it would fit, a check of all numbers, product style and manufacture said it should fit. There was no way this model was designed for a 1995 Ford Explorer. The details list about 200 vehicles the thing fits so be leery of it because 9 times out of 10 you will be sending it back, also don't throw the box away when you open it because it is a pain to find one that will fit this boom-a-rang looking thing. I paid for it via credit card on Dec 28th, 2007 and still waiting for my account to get credit as of Jan 28, 2008. So if you have some cash you will not miss for the next 30 to 90 days, go ahead and buy this product."
5,Turbo Jam,This is a great and fun way to get your heart pumping. The moves are easy to learn as well as it is just plain fun. I look forward to doing it every week. I recommend this to anyone.
2,Good money gone to waste.,"I spent good money for these dvd's and was incredibly disappointed when one of them didn't load. I've tried several times on several different players and it won't work in any of them. Im pisssed cause I feel like I got ripped off. I do enjoy the one video that does work and I've started seeing results, I just wish I had the other resources so I could get more into it."
3,Good if you didn't already have the original turbo jam,"I got turbo jam back in 2007 but I got the one with Punch, kick & jam, Fat blaster, Cardio party 3 and T3. I'm not as much of a fan of T3. I thought getting this would change things up. It's still the same workout overall, just a different setting. I will say I love the turbo sculpt and the cardio party with this set. If you already have the first set of Turbo jam, don't bother. Beachbody is coming out with a new Chalene workout called Turbo fire this summer. Looks more intense, involves HIIT and I can't wait to try it. If you're new to turbo jam, this is still worth getting!!"
3,burns calories but not challenging,"It's a fun, well structured workout that I have done faithfully for years along with Tae bo. So why only 3 stars? because although it does burn calories it does not increase your fitness. I can do the most advanced Tae Bo and Turbo Jam workouts yet cannot run for 10 minutes?! It wasn't until I jumped the turbo jam ship and started working out with Jillian Michaels 30 day shred and P90X that I've noticed I'm not just burning calories but I'm actually getting fit. I still use my turbo jam videos for cardio workouts because they are fun and they make you sweaty, but if you're interested in increasing your fitness substantially then use P90X or JM 30DS. Sorry Chalene!"
5,New Turbo Jam Fan!,"I had just seen an informercial for Turbo Jam and it looked kind of fun, so I thought I'd order it on Amazon. It's amazing! It's so much fun and Chalene is a wonderful motivator! I also love the music-it makes me want to move and work out hard! Her Ab Jam and Turbo Sculpt are killer workouts! Absolutely amazing and I would recommend it to everyone that's looking for a fun workout!"
2,Not so hot.,I had a hard time keeping up with the video. Didn't really like the way things were flowing. Some of the move hurt my back. I gave the take away after trying it three times.
3,product appears to be a copy...,"Disappointed w/quality of dvd, appears to be copy, but plays on my dvd so 3 stars. In addiition was visiting my daughter and paid for express ship, seller sent it priority via USPS, so arrived 3-4 days later. Amazon encourages allowing the seller to resolve any discrepancies prior to posting a negative review. Casino Princess response was expeditious, refunded my account for the shpping price difference and offered to accept the return on the product. I kept product as I opened and played it and didn't want the hassel of returning, paying for rtn postage and more hassels worrying about whether product was safely returned. 3 stars is for the late arrival (had time to use it once on vaca), overcharge, and product quality. Seller was gracious and eager to please, I appreciated that and respect the seller."
4,The only complaint is that people on dvd don't sweat!!,"I love this dvd and I sweat a lot when I am done, but my only complaint is that the people on the dvd are not sweaty at all. What is up with that? I find that annoying and unrealistic. Not one is sweaty."
1,Disappointed,"I have difficulties in reading DVDs, though I have repeatedly cleaned them they are ejected 9 times out of ten, and the workout is damaged in various points. Disappointed!"
5,Bying Turbo Jam,I love it ....i love it..... :-) This is a greet workout .... An i live in Denmark but i can still use it :-)
3,It's good BUT...,"This is a challenging and fun workout (well, except for the requisite baaad music) only IF you can get beyond the poor cueing. For me I need and appreciate someone who can guide me along whether I look at the screen or not. It's what I like about a Billy Blanks or Rodney Yee DVD. They are masters at cueing. Chalene is not. I found myself lost so many times (the pace can get rapid and confusing) that I just wanted to give up. Seriously, is there anything worse than having to stop and start several times during a workout? Making time or finding the motivation to work out is difficult enough - who needs distraction and frustration? Not me. I'm very surprised that someone like Chalene who obviously cares about helping people to get in shape would fail to understand how bad cueing can hamper a great workout experience. Weird. Anyway, for that I took off a star. Had to. So buyer beware is all I'm saying."
4,"I Didn't believe it could work this well, this fast","I've watched the infomercials several times, but still never made the commitment. I have a gym membership but with my work schedule, I needed something to help me be more consistent and help me BURN calories. I love cardiokickboxing, I love to dance, I love music. This tape has it all and BONUS, it has sculpting/weight lifting. I HATE lifting weights because for me it was boring. I did the Learn and Burn then explored the other workouts on the DVD. A few minutes into the Sculpt portion, I picked up my hand weights and joined in. I was lifting weight, but I was still sweating majorly! She has good instruction throughout and is very encouraging. I felt good! I felt energized! Even with limited sleep and after a long work day. Then, I checked myself out in the mirror and I can already see my abs starting to get more definition!! My worst area and I've NEVER had any definition. I can't wait to see how I change after weeks of working out and sculpting."
5,Only one for me!,"I absolutely love this exercise system!! I've tried so many things but I always ended up getting bored. Turbo Jam is the one exercise system I can stick to. The music just keeps you going and chalene is a great motivator. It's not very dancy and I absolutely love it! I'm 15 so I get very bored easily and don't have very much motivation. I'm in pretty good shape and I still work up a sweat. I love love love this product. I would recommend it to anyone, any age or any size. It is amazing!"
5,Very happy with my purchase!,I am very happy with my purchase of Turbo Jam Beachbody 5 Rockin Workouts! The DVDs are in excellent condition. I paid a fraction of what the infomercial advertises. I love the type of workouts that are on the DVDs and there are a variety of workout levels and intensities. The beginning workout that teaches you the moves and the correct posture are clear and understandable. Chalene is excellent at leading the workouts. She gives clear instruction and is encouraging and supportive. It is a fun way to get moving!
2,Very very annoying work out,"I Lund music annoying. There is a nice feature to turn off the music. However, instructor was just as annoying as a music.The reason why I gave 2 star rating- this workout is probably good for 20 year olds."
3,Turbo Jam,This is an ok DVD. The abs and turbo sculpt routines are easy to follow but the cardio routine is very fast paced and you will get confused with some of the moves. The people featured on this DVD are a bit strange. Poor choice of music for an exercise DVD. The music is weird.
4,Opening Day-Schubert Theater in Boston,"In early winter 1955 I attended the off-Broadway opening of PipeDream in the Schubert Theater in Boston. I had a seat inthe last row of the upper balcony and yet the music and playwas delightful. The song, ""No Other Love"" was borrowedfrom Richard Rogers score from ""Victory at Sea"" so even the besttake short cuts from time to time. As best I could I wrotedown snipets of the musical score so I could poke out the tuneson the piano back at the home I was living in for the guys whowere interested in whatever new songs would be containedin this new musical. Actually many of the songs were ""catchy""and I was suprised that with the remake between Boston andNew York that this musical somehow did not take with the public.Some of the songs were at least as catchy as those in priormusicals, like Oklahoma. In any event it was a most memorableexperience for a young college kid from Pittsburgh, Pa.Oh yes, I still like the music."
4,"great book, Spanish only","This is a great little book. My kids and I really enjoyed the illustrations; they make this book. We don't speak spanish, or are very limited, but were able to get the gist of the story with the pictures. It is a story about a little cat who gets a cactus and returns home with his two friends to water, fertilize, groom, and dress the cactus. Their actions, however, almost lead to the cactus' demise and they must return it to the original owner to help in the recovery."
1,Dented Pillow,The pillow is separated in the middle like there are two pillows instead of one body pillow and not as comfortable as expected.
4,a good read,"What made this book different from most romances is that they liked each other during the last third of the book and then we got to see how their relationship could last for the next twenty years. Usually the romance relationships are so volitile that I often wonder would I want to be in that situation; no matter how beautiful the guy is.The author didn't go for the rich guy and the girl who had only a tough moment. The woman had a tough life. She worked hard to make good choices and she learned from her choices she made in life. It was good to read that she got a job as a cook and did well at it. Other books I have read, the woman got the job but failed miserable as a cook for the cowboys and the men let the woman get away with being a bad cook. Wow. How boring.I liked that fact she liked being touch. Being tactile is so important to some people and the author did a good job understanding that.Easy read and different from the usual out on the market"
5,JEFF BECK ROCKS,"I STILL HAVE THE ""TAPE"", OF COURSE ROD SEWART IS TOTALLY THE BEST, BUT JEFF'S GUITAR IS INCREDIBLE, HE IS A GOD, HE SITS ON A THRONE NEXT TO ERIC CLAPTON.JEFF'S ""BOLERO"", STILL BLASTS THROUGH MY HEART AND SOUL, IT IS A CONSTANT REMINDER THAT THE MUSIC OF TODAY IS NO WHERE AS CLOSE TO THESE GREAT MUSICIANS..GLAD I WAS ABLE TO SEE AND HEAR AND LIVE THESE YEARS.....MUSIC IS MY LIFE LINE.........."
4,Jeff's answer to Jimmy's Led Zepp,"And the rest is history. Jeff's Stewart no match for Jimmy's Plant. At least not in these context. This is more of a historical footnote than a masterpiece. Not very cohesive as Jeff tried to veer Rod into an arena that he did not beling to. Nice try, but not really. Oh well, it sure was a good try."
2,Hmmm -- really not that special. Surprisingly bad.,"Well I loved Eric Clapton's Blues Breakers album, I thought Jeff Beck's ""Blow By Blow"" showed genius and I had heard that this album was a raw early classic. Even with Rod Stewart on vocals I didn't think this album was very special at all. Green Sleeves and Old Man River -- come on! Disappointing (sorry -- but he did call it Truth after all) :(."
1,A waste,"It is hard to understand why this is titled for Jeff Beck. It really is a poor tribute to early Rod Stewart with Jeff Beck apparently in the background. A waste of money to me. I'm not sure where the ""Truth"" is."
2,review of Universe in a Nutshell,"The book contains many neat diagrams and pictures. Also some good quick summaries of Einstein's work. However, most of the book is far too abstract for a layman. A scientist might be able to follow the concepts, but only if she was familiar with the mathematics behind them."
4,My review in a nutshell,Good science book for anyone interested in science/space. The illustations are well thought out and really do help the reader visualize the topics.
2,Cosmology Lite,"Trying to simplify, in order to target a larger audience, Hawking left out all explanation, leaving bare statements without any support. If you haven't read other authors on these matters, you won't get anything out of the book other than pretty pictures that aren't very relevant.I recommend Brian Greene's ""The Elegant Universe"""
4,A good account of the Western Front,"In typical Ambrose style, this book is an easy-to-read account of the Western Front, from June 1944 (following the Normandy Invasion) to the end of the war in May 1945. While Ambrose does cover the push into Germany from the strategic perspective, this is really the story of the ordinary American soldier of that time, who performed his duty well under the most trying of conditions.The book is in one sense quite sad, as you feel you get to know some of the real-life individuals who were killed. On the other hand, the accounts of personal and collective courage are inspiring. Further, Ambrose provides good food for thought in his argument that the hardships of the war produced a generation of Americans who, in the second half of the century, built the U.S. into the prosperous country that it is today."
4,Band of Brothers,"A very readable account of the daily life and the obstacles encountered by GIs in Europe. It gave me a new understanding of the phase of the war involving the Maginot Line and Bastogne, and particularly of the attitudes that developed among the soldiers to want to just get the job done, and go home."
2,entertaining propoganda,"Enjoyable read, but all of Stephan Ambrose's writing has John Wayne tendancies. In other words he writes in the viewpoint of the victor. It seems he only does research that suits his pro-American ideals. For different perspectives, read The Rommel Papers and The Forgotten Soldier. These are books by people who really were there. Please don't read Citizen Soldier as fact and history"
3,A Vital Record,"Ambrose's book superbly captures the horrors and drama experienced by GI's in WWII. This masterful text is a vital record of first-person accounts--the soldiers re-telling it as they remember it. Ambrose's sense of dramatic story-telling is also at play here. He weaves the interviews together brilliantly. Therein, however, is a critcal aspect of this project too many readers miss: Ambrose goes for the dramatic and first-person record sometimes as the expense of objectivity. Ambrose is not as good of a military historian as John Keegan--Keegan's depth, fact-finding, objectivity, and analysis in writing military history is remarkable. Ambrose, it must be noted, is not a traditional or always even rigorous historian (relatively speaking only); he's not afraid to be a bit of a cheerleader during his book, to chose sides and even allow the vaguest whiff of jingoism ot flit across the odd page here or there."
5,Found the German point of view most interesting.,"I've read the book twice. The first time I was enthralled with the tales of the combatants. Dr. Ambrose brought the story of those eleven months to life for me by allowing people who were there to do the telling. I found accounts told by German soldiers particularly interesting. I will seek out more literature containing such accounts.During the second reading I was trying to revisit some of my favorite historical characters whom I met the first time, such as General Gavin, Lt. Waverly Wray, the 29th Infantry Div., and many more. Lots of heroes I never knew about...on both sides.That's a thought that occurs to me....Ambrose doesn't paint the men as heroic. He lets the real storytellers (the GI's) create the heroes.Meet'em yourself. Buy the book. You'll be glad you did."
5,Simply The Best,"Ambrose factually describes the way the war was for our soldiers ""over there"". In my opinion simply THE BEST BOOK ON THE WWII INFANTRY. Need I say more?"
5,Talk about heroes!,"My father was a B-17 pilot stationed in Northeast England in the latter stages of the war. Citizen Soldiers is the story of men like him. Average American young men, coming out of the depression enlisting for a great cause. These are the people who are the true ""stars"" of our society.Only until I read Citizen Soldiers was I fully able to comprehend the horror of battle and the awful conditions our troops faced. Mr Ambrose does a great job of telling the story of the men and women who literally saved the world. In a few years I hope my eleven year old son reads this book so he can better understand what others before him have done so that we can live the easy lives we have. Bravo Mr. Ambrose!"
4,"Historical, informative entertaining book. Typical Ambrose!","Eye-opening account of our front line soldiers and what they endured to ensure our freedom. Once again, Mr. Ambrose brings alive an old subject with new stories about the people involved. Particularly liked how he concentrated on the foot soldiers versus the generals."
5,101 reasons why you shouldn't be a foot soldier,"Ambrose himslef didn't write much of the book. He took and compiled hunderds of GI accounts. Each story carriees with it a story of horror, of heroism, or simply just the soldier's life. This book has given me a great respect for the grunts of World War two and what they went through. I highly recommend this and Ambose's other books"
4,Dave Mckenna 1,"Dave Mckenna's laid back style and complex piano mastery shows through in this collection of good old standard songs. Powerful bass rythmes produced by his left hand, combined with intricate melodies from his right hand make for enjoyable listening."
3,Not One I Would Keep For A Reference,"""Psalms 2"" completes author Carroll Stuhlmueller, C.P.'s study of the Psalter. It follows the pattern of presenting the individual Psalm, analyzing it in terms of the time and place of its origin, its use in ancient liturgical worship and the linguistic peculiarities that provide insights into its meaning. Now that I have finished this two volume set I have a better understanding of the usage and origins of Psalms in general, but do not have an enhanced understanding of particular psalms. This is not the kind of book that I would keep for reference when reading Psalms or hearing them used at Mass."
3,Fundamentals of Anatomy and Physiology,"The textbook is OK and the applications and atlas are nice to have to complement the main book, but I did not receive an access code from Amazon with my product so was not able to access the extra study materials or practice tests that are often referred to in the text. Numerous e mails to the publisher requesting the necessary access code(for my NEW textbook) were not effective; they blamed Amazon for the slight in materials and never did send me an access code.I feel the publisher/author misrepresent the product by not granting access to materials that are advertised in the text."
2,Makes a tough topic even more difficult to comprehend,"I am not a fan of this book. If you're buying it for fun, choose another one. If your professor requires it, buy something else to complement your studying (I liked Anatomy and Physiology The Easy Way) or pray you have an awesome professor. This text book is not concise at all, incorporates pointless analogies, and does not describe things in order. I had to read through some sections multiple times in order to understand what was being explained. The only redeeming factors were the IP-9 System Suite, which did a good job of explaining things and had helpful quizzes, and some good illustrations in the book. The atlas is also helpful for memorizing the skeletal system... But overall, if you can avoid using this textbook, then do so!"
5,Wonderful!,"Book came promptly and in great condition! Also, when contacting seller, seller was very prompt."
1,DON'T DO IT TO YOURSELF IF YOU DON'T HAVE TO...,"This is the most horribly written book with wordy descriptions and it would take about 10 pages to make one simple point. I suffered through the 6th edition for Anatomy 1 and 2. At the end of Anatomy 2, I brought that demon outside, poured perfume over it, and had a bonfire. I watched it burn and was happy to see it go. Any updated edition would only be more suffering. If the drop screen allowed me to give negative 10, I would have done so, gladly."
4,Intro to Tantra,"The book is an easy-to-read introduction to tantra. Some of the tools are helpful, such as eye contact, breathing techniques and concentrating on your partner; others are somewhat vague, such as meditation and internal energy flow inside of a body, etc. Overall, I would recommend this book - it's light reading one can finish in a week."
4,Being new to this..,"Being new to tantric philosophy, I greatly enjoyed reading this book. It described drastically new ways to think about sex that had never occurred to me and I am quite appreciative of these new thoughts.This book is not a how-to or list of exercises to try. There are exercises and suggested activities along the way, but the bulk of the book explains the warm and honest ideas behind tantric philosophy. If you want something with more action, I suggest ""Urban Tantra"" by Carrellas ALONG WITH this book. ""The Heart of Tantric Sex"" is a great introduction and is quite true to its title."
3,"I agree, and disagree...","My son has high-functioning autism, and I agree with the previous reviewer that this book can be dangerously lulling to parents who are in denial and don't pursue a proper diagnosis for their child merely because they've read this book. However, I also know that, at age 7, my own boy finds it encouraging and loves to read it. So, maybe a good idea would be for the publisher to add some information to the book explaining what does and doesn't constitute significant developmental delay. This would be useful information for both parents and educators, especially since the incidence/diagnosis of developmental disabilities is on an alarming increase.I also feel there is some merit in encouraging other children to be tolerant and respectful of differences in development, and this book can be useful in that regard as well. :-)"
5,Wonderful story and illustrations,"This is such a memorable book! I read it a thousand times over and would read it any child. Some of the reviews I have read indicate that it's great for children who are late bloomers. I believe that it is great for all children. It is important for all of us, late bloomers or not, to understand that everything happens in its own time. That is a lesson I think most adults still need to learn!"
1,"Please, just take stupid (far away)","I've generally greatly enjoyed Barreca's books, starting with ***Snow White, but this one left me totally unimpressed. The conversations with her co-author were banal and leaden, and the ""funny"" bits were about as amusing as dragging around a 50lb weight chained to your ankle. Separately I know Barreca is amusing and insightful, and Weingarten might be, but together they're beating a very dead horse."
3,Good reference material. BUT...,"This is a useful reference manual. However, it doesn't appear to be as tailored to the cluster exams as it might claim.Also -- and more painfully, IMO -- this book STILL uses concepts as of version 5. It's 2002 and the book hasn't been updated from 1998 principles. That's an eternity in this business! Nevertheless, many of the same concepts apply, but it is still in desperate need of a revision to include UDB V7."
4,She Lets them Have It!,"Oriana Fallaci is angry and she lets them have it!I wish I could read her in Italian, but I can't, so I purchased this book. This book deals with her rage over the bombing of the World Trade Center and the arrogance of those fanatics who think that by random terrorist acts they can--what--put us back into the 14th century with Osama bin Laden as caliph of Baghdad?This is a short book and not very deep but Ms. Fallaci does say a lot of things many of us are thinking."
1,Nothing like 100+ pages of rambling,"I bought this book to read about the coming battle between Islamists and Christians, but was greated by 100+ pages of rambling. Unless you don't have anything else to do, don't waste your time on this book."
3,read with discernment,You need to know the Bible in order to discern what is right and wrong. This book is clear on what he tried to communicate.
3,Well...,"I agree that the camera angels are not great, and the fact that he goes through ALL of the moves before putting them together is not good. When he does put it all together i would have liked him to move a little faster, being that it is SLOW compared to with music. However, I don't really agree with the not mirroring part... some other videos of mine dont mirror, so im used to it. All is all, its not the BEST video- (one i really like is ""go fatima- learn to dance"" in which you learn Backstreet Boys and Aaliyah), but if you want to learn some n sync and britney its worth it."
3,Good video but bad instruction!,I bought this video hoping to learn some of the great moves of todays popstars. The video was good in the fact that they broke down the moves and taught you step by step. My big complaint is I mostly taught myself the routines. It goes way to fast and once you learn one move he just moves on. I had to keep stoping and rewinding. I put the steps together myself and kept practicing. Darrin never goes back and reviews the whole routine until the end. Thats when you can barely remember what you learnt 10 minutes ago. I did learn the routines but with really no help from the video.
4,"really good, but lots of rewinding","This is a really good video and I would recommend it to anyone who is willing to keep trying until they get it. I have been dancing for eight years and this tape taught me a lot. I had never had this kind of dance before. I only had like 3 complaints. One thing is the camera angle. Sometimes it only shows from the waist up but generally when he repeats it you can catch the feet so it's not that bad. The second thing is that he only shows a section 2 or 3 times and then moves on which means you have to rewind it a lot. The third thing which really messed me up was that I got through a lot of it before I found out that you have to reverse everything he does. If you can put up with these things, it is an awesome video and I would really recommend it."
1,DON'T BUY IT. JUST WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY.,I and my daughter (17 years old) and my son (7 years old) could not follow his instructions even thought we tried very hard. Just a waste of my money. Disappointed.
1,Horrible!,"I was very disappointed with this video. Darrin does not do a good job of breaking the routines down. He teaches an 8 count slowly but does not go into detail with each move. Then, he just keeps adding on 8 count sections in slow motion until the end and then expects you to just do the whole routine in regular time from the beginning. Because he does not go into a lot of detail, you have to watch him very carefully and there are times when the camera only shows his upper body, so it is absolutely impossible to know what your legs/feet are supposed to do. The routines are short and there are songs from only three artists/groups. I was very frustrated trying to learn these routines and i've been dancing for almost 20 years, since I was 5. Don't waste your money on this one, folks."
2,It's not bad--not great,"I have danced for a few years. I can tell that this was made for the average person, not a dancer who wants to excel in dance. There is no technique. It's like, ""learn this and look like you know what you're doing."" Darrin's the teacher nobody likes. He's doing his best to teach you. He's nice and all, he just doesn't teach well enough. I was also disappointed to find out that you just learn the chorus part of the dance. I thought it was the whole dance.On the plus side, it's fun and challenging. I would really recommend getting a bunch of friends together and have a dance party. Hey, make a video of the choreography, send it into TRL on MTV, and get on TV. Isn't that worth it?"
2,More Hype than Substance,"I got this to learn some hip-hop moves to incorporate into my dance routine. While it is fun to watch, it is definitely not made to be an instructional piece. I agree w/everyone's gripe about the orientation and mirroring aspect. The ""slow"" part of showing the steps were laughable.Look to it for ideas and inspiration. Don't count on learning moves clearly and step-by-step w/this.There are good dancers and/or good dance instructors. It is not common to see both in one person. Darrin is an awesome dancer, but a visibly unseasoned instructor as demonstrated by this sad example."
2,Hard To Follow,"This tape is really hard to do if you don't have previous dance experience. It is hard to follow especially because Darrin is facing you when he's dancing, so you have to reverse what he's doing."
5,Love this book,Love this book by Corrie ten Boom. High quality and well worth the price. Would recommend to anyone who love Corrie ten Boom.
5,Great research,"I bought this book, and never found the time to read it, but did skip around a bit. This book has excellent research, and if I was an herbalist or doctor i would probably find some useful information in it."
1,Such a deal!!,"13 ounces of dishwashing soap for only $49.99?!! Hey, that's like less than a pint for FIFTY BUCKS!!! Where do I sign??!!! I voted for 0bama, too!!!"
4,Well written and informative,"Every fan of Antarctic exploration should read this book. It is a great tribute to those who came so many years before Shackleton, Scott and others into this completely unknown part of our world. The accounts are vivid and often times humorous, in spite of the incredible hardships these men endured. Although this might be considered difficult subject matter, the author does a great job of telling each story of adventure in a compelling and griping manner. We owe much to these men for their leadership, courage and vision. The account of Captain Cook is particularly good. What a great leader! This is a good addition for all you arm-chair explorers."
1,Just don't...,"I bought this thinking I would save a few bucks.Well, since I paid for this, then bought a proper sensor,that, uh actually WORKS, I didn't save squat.Buy the right one. Don't waste your time or money.Update;I should have stated that the ""proper"" sensor I boughtwas the Denso 234-4052, also from Amazon.As in the review above, the wiring is simple. (4 wires)I do not recomend.PP4x4"
1,Fine initially but failed after 6 months,"This camcorder was purchased as a gift for my daughter and used about 12 times over a 6 month period before experiencing intermittent failures. The labor warranty on this unit is only 90 days and labor costs for repair approach the original cost. It is unconscionable for Panasonic to market a defective product like this. This reflects poorly on their other products and unless they address this issue with me, I will avoid their products and advise others to avoid their products as well. I might chalk this up to one defective unit if I hadn't read other accounts of the same issue. This is a manufacturing or design defect that has not been addressed by Panasonic."
2,No warming sensation at all,"My wife and I bought this product to see how it worked and were very dissapointed. there was no warming sinsation at all. We have used ""Wet "" original and found it to be a much better product over all."
4,neat picture book,The book is set in the 1930 and based on the historic story of Mokawk steelworks. The little boy in the story has a father who has gone to the city to work on the NewYork Sky scrapers. He misses his father and only get to see him on weekends. One day his Mama takes him into the city to visit his father. This are much different from the ways he is use to on the reservation. When he sees his father at work on the tall buildings he describes it as seeing his father dance across the sky. This is where the title of the book comes from.The book was easy to read and moved at a fast pace.I would recommend the book to others. It's a good book to read while learning more about New York City. It gives us a chance to think about how the city might have looked in the 1930's before all of the sky scrapers were built.
3,Elvira at her best!!!,"Nothing is as fun as watching Elvira watching these bad horror movies. Growing up in the Los Angeles area Elvira and her Movie Macabre was a weekend staple in the eighties on KHJ Channel 9.These movies are both campy and fun. Perfect for Elvira to take a whack at. The MST3K kids, as fun as they are, should thank Cassandra Peterson everyday for making this genre hip and fun again. Maneater of Hydra is a knock off of The Day of the Triffids with a monster instead of a bunch of trees eating the cast. The House that Screamed is a pretty good little movie in the spooky drive-in movie category. It was loosely remade in the eighties as Pieces. It has been unavailable in the US years except in bad VHS copies from Europe.All-in-all the entire package is just silly fun and thanks to Elvira and her sometimes priceless one liners, well worth the price. We love you Cassie, Happy Halloween!"
2,Bunny Mold,"I received the bunny mold, but was disappointed in that it just looked like a 2D mold. It was smaller than I expected."
5,"keep on the sunny side, always on the sunny side...","Use this in the windows of my motor home when I in the sunny south. Cut to fit, and yer good to go. Works great."
1,What a disappointment!,"I am a huge fan of Ms. Brown's previous work, but this one went right into the recycle bin. Too much time spent on descriptions of the clothes and the tack and the food and the whiny justifications for hunting in the 21st century. The characters were wooden (including the cutesy talking animals)and the plot reminded me of a previous entry in the much-better written Rita Mae-and Sneaky Pie series, where I think it should have stayed. This would possibly have made a nice essay about Southern heritage in some niche mag, but doesn't do a thing for mystery lovers or fans of good writing. Sorry."
4,Rita Mae be habit forming,"This book, as well as the others by Rita Mae Brown, is a well written, funny book that one can appreciate more if you are familiar with her previous books. The characters are always interesting and fun. It is a pleasure to read more about them and the musing of the animals make it very special."
3,Expecting More,"From an author that I have come to think of as a favorite I was expecting more from this book. I was truly let down. The characters are well drawn, and I did learn a lot about fox hunting, yet neither made up for a lack of action ( unless you count the numerous hunts). If you love fox hunting then you will enjoy this book.. if not then I strongly suggest you read Rita Mae Brown's other books. They are much more enjoyable and fast paced."
5,Well worth it,I always did like this movie. Too bad none of these old classics were never released by the original studios. But I'd recommend this one.
5,Buckets of tears and popcorn,"Oh yes, this is my favourite film of all time. Time... this is the essence of the movie. It was made in wartime and the opening sequence is set just in wartime, at the end of the war to end all wars. Time is lost, nearly 20 years of it, as Paula waits for Smithy to unlock his memory. The key fits the lock in the door to the cottage and the love that was lost is recovered but the time never can be. A moment which makes the hardest of hearts weep, but is it for joy or in sorrow? It is better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all. Or is it? Being transfixed by the skill of Garson and Colman provides the answer, but it will not be painless."
3,"oldie, but ....oldie","This old movie was and interesting story with a predictable 1940's ending. This movie was recommended to me by old and dear friends, and while I'm sure it was an exciting movie then, it seems to have lost a little with the times."
3,Pender's great work.,"The author Pender's great work. I just wish Pender used easier language. It takes long to understand it. However, ideas are fascinating."
4,Not Free SF Reader,"Human sacrifice will backfire if you pick an immortal.I didn't like this one as much as the first, but still a fine adventure.Basically, all you have to hear is this 'Vikings vs Olmecs' and what more do you need to know?Ok, one more thing - what happens when you try and do the chop the heart out ritual thing on someone curse dby the 'sun of gud' to not die.Casca, of course, living has to keep wondering, much as they who come later MacLeod's, and is pretty much of the same school of decent bloke.The setup here is the discovery in a museum of armor of the time of this particular escapade, and an artifact whose face looks rather like Casca's.Absolutely worth giving one of these books a go if you like this sort of genre.3.5 out of 5"
1,they ruined Jackie Chan,"this movie ruined Chan. he wasnt good at all, his character was likable but the movie went nowhere, oh, wow, a tuxedo, if you put it on you get superhuman super powers, what a croc and in the mix Jennifer Love Hewitt who is so [***] and annoying that she ruins the whole thing. didnt go nowhere,just sat there in the closet and didnt move. its a toilet flusher, is what it is. dont expect to see any action from Jackie Chan because he was used with special computer, thingys. horribly made and directed. my god!!!"
2,Chan's Bond spoof should have been funnier and more exciting,"Though watchable and somewhat engaging, the problem with ""The Tuxedo"" is that it comes up short in the two elements one looks forward to in a Jackie Chan film: action and humor. To be sure, there's some action, but it's mostly of the generic action-movie variety than the amazingly-choreographed set pieces we've come to expect in a Chan film. And in place of the usual humor, there's a darkness and mean-spiritness that detracts from the other thing we expect from Mr. Chan: a good time at the movies. Less than a minute or so into the film, for example, we're treated to a [...] joke and a fairly graphic (though admittedly creative) murder by drowning. I guess I don't want to say that all Jackie Chan movies have to adhere to the same light humor/amazing action formula, only that this attempt to be a little different didn't add much to the mix."
3,"Funny, but not his best","Jackie Chan makes entertaining movies. This one is all that. He also shows off amazing martial arts. This one has amazing special effects.It's a three star effort. Deduct one because too much of the action relies on computer effects and to little on Chan's acrobatics, and the foes he faces couldn't slow down a grandma. Deduct one more star for poor production and attention to detail, unless, of course, you enjoy watching microphones dangling in the top of the shots in mulitple scenes - I counted five different scenes, but I only watched it once and was not really looking for them. Cinematographer and editor need to keep their day jobs at Mickey D's.But if you like Jackie Chan movies you will get some good laughs from this one. And as always, the outtakes were a scream."
3,NOT a martial arts movie.,This is a good comedy. Silly like austin powers. It is NOT a martial arts movie. It does not even resemble a martial arts movie.
2,"Pete Seeger is awesome and well respected, however......",I bought this in hopes of learning how to play the 5-string Banjo. I had already purchased the book which I thought came with the DVD but apparently not. So i had to order the DVD seperate. Even though Pete Seeger is well respected and loved I really didn't get anything out of it except to notice that his finger nails were exceptionally gross and dirty!I could say I might have gotten a 1% improvement in my banjo playing. I still have alot of respect for this guy but I would have rather it been..put your finger here...do this...do that kind of instruction. Nice to have the book in my collection now that I know it paid his grandkids way to college.
4,great learning tool,this book is a great resource for honing diagnostic skills in general and helps the reader become more adept at considering differentials as well. the cases are very interesting and thought-provoking. another great resource isDSM-IV Made Easy: The Clinician's Guide to Diagnosis. this book offers more of an educational and explanatory approach to diagnosis AND includes case examples. it rates 5 stars for that extra elaboration.
5,"Everything You Want... Is This CD-Single, So Buy It!","Well, well! After half a year on the Billboard charts, this title FINALLY sees a US release as a commercial single! This will give the single a strong chance to rise to the top of the Billboard Hot 100 within the next couple of weeks. Vertical Horizon are an awesome band. Have you seen their VH-1 miniconcert? The CD-Single also contains a live track from another album - a cool bonus. The lyrics and the video of ""Everything You Want"" will stick with you until you are stark-raving mad, so you have been warned!"
3,Review of The End Of The Third World,"Nigel Harris is trying to get across that there are no longer any third world countries, and that term is no longer useful. The third world term refers to the underdeveloped countries. The third world is endnig because they are going from agriculture to limiting the amont of imports they had, to export-led development. They are turning to the manufacturing business, and they are follownig certian models. The Asian market follow the Japanese model of savnig their money, no consumption of imports, and expoting, as well as not taking any loans from outside investors. The Amerecias follow the U.S. model, and are consumption driven, with the manufacturing on the down slide, and service jobs on the upride. The Amerecias were the developers, and the third world countries were the consumers, but that has changed to a complete turn around, and now it is the opposite, and we are dependent on each other. That is how there is the end of the term third world."
2,Why not just print the script?,"Unlike the other books based on the TNT movies, I got nothing out of this book as a companion. If you haven't been able to catch the movie, then go ahead and read this, otherwise you're better off watching the film (assuming you can stand Chen's abrasive score)."
4,A good book with a good plot.,I think this was a good movie turned into a good tv-movie. The only problem I think is that it need a little more information about the Drakh. Give a little more info I what they have been doing for the past 5 years. Still a good book.
2,"The Rock, (...)","This flick is carried by the charisma of THE ROCK. The plot, which centers around a 'recovery specialist' named Beck (THE ROCK) who is sent to the Amazon to collect the son of a mobster (SCOTT) who is on a treasure hunt, is solid at its base, but way too top heavy with silly fight scenes, hit or miss humor, and MTV style direction. This is one of those films that doesn't take itself seriously, hence the action/adventure angle is always on either side of the goofy line between funny and exciting. You can't help but like THE ROCK, there is something about him that captures your attention, but by the end of THE RUNDOWN, you feel slightly embarassed for him. It will be nice after a couple more movies to see him in full-on TOTAL RECALLish action mode. THE RUNDOWN isn't an awful film and does have a few entertaining moments, but must have looked a lot better on the printed page."
1,Does not work,This is the HD version. My DVD player is HD but the DVD player does not read the disk. The process to return the tape is not worth the time or effort because the cost was low.
4,"Great movie, Action, comedy, and Christopher Walken, 90 minutes of fun","The rock in what would be his first major release movie, the rundown is a story of Beck (the Rock) who is a ""collection agent"" for a gambling ring. Beck just wants out of the business after so many years of fighting to open a restaurant. But, his boss wants him to do one last job, retrieve his son Travis (shawn william scott) from Brazil's jungles and bring him back home to pay for some outstanding debts. So off to brazil, to El dorado, a small town controlled by a ruthless miner, played by Christopher Walken. Beck is a man of honor, and he will bring back Travis, but along the way, things get complicated when a priceless artifiact Travis has located comes into play. I could go on, but just get this movie. Its funny, and it got some good action and fight scenes. 90 minutes of fun, check it out."
5,The Rock doing comedy what a combination,I was astonished on how good this movie was. I really didn't think it was going to be that good. The movie made me laugh so much. It was definitly worth the time and money to watch that movie. The Rock out does himself in the fight scenes which is great. His work with Seann William Scott was incredible. I think they should probably work together again. This movie is a must see if you have nothing else to do or watch go to the movies and see The Rundown you will not be disappointed.
4,Romancing the Stone meets the Odd Couple,"The Rock is destined to become the next Arnold Schwartzenegger, and he really proves it in this film. Sean William Scott reprises his usual party boy role, and Christopher Walken also brings back that quirky villain we are used to seeing. The film suprised me. I expected it to be tasteless and dorky, but it was actually action packed, and clever. The action is non-stop (as well as the humor) with good special effects, and extremely impressive stunt work. If you are a fan of the Rock, this is definately the film for you."
3,Lots of fun,"This was a hell of a fun film.I was initially expecting something much worse,but was pleasently surprised.There were great stunts&action from begining to end,and ""The Rock"" has pretty much found his nich in Hollywood as the next action hero.Seems as though Shwartzenager has passed the torch in favor of pollitics,and you get to see that more or less in the begining.The Rock also has a good comedic side to him,and it adds to the enjoyment of this film.Alot of fun gets poked at him,and he plays off it very well.The fight scenes were pretty exciting,he even gets the S&^#!?#^* slapped out of him by a 5ft tall 115lb guy....it was quite good.Christopher Walken is always a joy to see,even if he has small parts.He has a certin charisma about him,and he can just do ""the greedy bad guy"" without even trying.All in all...it's a blast,and you'll be thinking by the end of the film.Option A,B....but what about option C?"
5,Decent but predictable.,Dwayne Johnson is a good actor and what can I say - he is just so handsome and rugged. The Rock still rocks!
5,The Rundown,I love Dwayne Johnson. He has made so many different types of movies and he is good in every one of them. This particular movie is very funny and is a good movie that most of the family can watch. There is some violence but the majority of the movie is comical. The actor Seann William Scott is also a big hit in this. This one is a keeper.
1,Rundown,Could not be watched on DVD player. You can no longer even purchase hd players . So I can not say about the quality.
1,Wack,"I love dude from American Pie (although B2K should've won the dance award) and the Roc is a major favorite (ever since that one episode of Punk'd), this movie was terrible. I fell asleep on it four times. The only good part was the beginning with the extremely gorgeous baseball player dealing with the ring. That's it. The rest of the movie was a little too cliche--eew, find a treasure. Great in bedtime stories, not good for two grown men who seem completely out of place in a jungle. I liked the short guy who talked about Ali ""Float like a budda-fly"" though. The humor wasn't even amusing because the movie was just too slow and far out for me."
3,If the jungle people speaks BRAZILIAN portuguese why do they talk like portuguese????,"The movie is good. But their brazilian portuguese SUCKs. I mean if they were from ""Brazil"" why do they talk like portuguese people i meant Portuguese people from Portugal, I hate watching the movie due to that reason for me the movie does not pass the feeling of reality at all...for example in the movie TAXI even Queen Latifa does a great job talking a lil brazilian portuguese...."
3,"Solid Action film, with great Humor.","The Rundown really showcased Dwayne Johnson's physicality and comedic talent.Plus you had a solid supporting cast with Rosario Dawson and Seann Willian Scott from the American Pie films. Christopher Walken showed up and did what he does best. Got a bit sad while watching this recently, because of the direction Johnson's film career has taken. Arnuld OFFICIALLY passed the torch to him in The Rundown, but he ends up a whore for Disney?Oh yeah, what happened to the sequel that was planned?"
1,cd the rundown is defective,the rundown pauses every few minutes throughout the entire movie. would love to be able to return it. also i do not like the wide screen and will be more careful when ordering movies
4,great sports bra - fits snug,Sports bra is great but shipping service from this vendor was terrible. Item was ordered weeks before x-mas and it was received a week after x-mas with no excuse from shipper or attempt to reverse shipping charges. Will not buy from this vendor again
4,Good read.,"I like this series by Poyer. I'm ex-Navy and his renditions of the environment are very realistic. I read some of the later books in the series first, mainly because they are available in Kindle - wish they all were. I recommend this book and the series to anyone who likes a good military adventure."
4,pigs in the parlor,"Greetings To the people seriously informed about the pigs in the parlor...i have to say well done authors..only those inflicted with the demons would disagree...Christians like everyone else have problems at times with slipping into error...i say oink to the detractors.May God bring His blessings to you authors,.. and all who read this well written guide.robert donaldson New Zealand...no hidden names here mr bird"
5,Great book. A real eye-opener.,"I enjoyed this book for several different reasons. First, it is nothing like I have read before. It brings a different perspective to the table and makes you re-think behaviors. I may not have agreed with every word in the book, such as demons can only leave by being coughed out, but overall it was great. I think there are times when you can agree to disagree on some things without thinking the entire book is incorrect. I enjoyed it and will re-read it and use it as a reference."
5,A very good book but only for the spiritually mature in Christ!,"This is a very good book to read for anyone who is anointed in casting out demons, this book teaches you how some demons can enter and the different ways they are expelled and also how they couple. This is not a book for curious minded people but for people who have been anointed and called for this particular ministry as it will give you more knowledge in this area. I read the book and I thought it was very informative and it gave me knowledge on some things I did not know. A MUST READ for those walking in this area! I REPEAT DO NOT read this book if you are curious or if this is not an area Christ has called you to because you may open some doors you may not know how to close!"
1,The Perfect Book to Destroy Your Church,"If you like insanity, then this book is for you. Christians sin, because they are sinners...sinners saved by grace."
3,Two rough and ready cops stop crime in Harlem,The difference between the cops and the crooks is the cops keep looking for justice however they come by it while the crooks look for gain. Very well written although dark. An eye openers for those of us who don't know anything about Harlem in the 60's.
1,crap quality.,This entire costume is from the front. From the back without a cape you'd look like an ass. Cod pieces tie on with string. Back uses a piece of velcro. The chest is baggy. The mask I had to replace with another mask which cost a few hundred bucks. Boot cover things are kind of a joke. So are essentially strapping some rubber pieces to a leotard. garbage. Thing probably cost less than $10 to make. poorly.
4,A Different Lucy,"I bought this as a gift for my friend who LOVES Lucille Ball. I assumed it would be the lucy show, and its not. Instead these are episodes of the shows she did AFTER the ""I LOVE LUCY"" show. Lucille is older but just as funny. It's a diferent side of the actress but not bad. I don't know what the other review ment when they said they were bootleg. Good quality DVDs and even a bonus DVD of Betty White's show ""Life With Elizabeth."" If you're looking for the ""I LOVE LUCY"" then this is NOT what you want. If your a Lucille Ball fan and want to see some of her later work... This is PERFECT. Same slap-stick comedy different age. It dosent incorporate all 30 years of her on the screen, just the last few. And whatever people say not bootleg."
3,Multiple Twists,"Clive Owen and Julia Roberts, you'd think they would have great chemistry and they do...sorta.Duplicity is a confusing movie about corporate spies with twists and jumps in time.Our two stars are ex-spies. Roberts is ex CIA and Owens is EX MI6.They decide to go into the private sector to swindle a large chunk of cash from an unsuspecting corporation.As the movie unfolds, you aren't quite sure who to believe as neither character trusts the other.Who will end up with the money?Duplicity boasts a stellar supporting cast: Tom Wilkinson and Paul Giamatti play the CEOs of competing businesses and they are at each other's throats.Wilkinson's company has a secret new product that will revolutionize the business and Giamatti wants it. Enter our spies.Rated PG-13 for language and some sexual content."
2,Duplicity....,What a waste of acting power!! This movie was so boring and full of sex scenes that make the story line non existant. It is just not what the trailor made it out to be....too bad for Julia Roberts and Clive Owen!
2,Disappointment,"I am very fond of both of these actors, but this movie bored me to tears. It basically annoyed me from the beginning with the several screen shots at the same time, which I understand some might see as more challenging and artistic. I just want a good story that I don't feel lost in the whole time. It also helps to have more likable characters. You really want your characters to have chemistry, and I just wasn't feeling it. I enjoy the cleverness of all the Oceans movies, and I was hoping for a movie along those lines, but it was not."
3,Confusing but Good,"This movie was good but it was cofusing with all the jumps back in time and all the twists and turns. In the end it paid off. I like Clive and Julia Roberts together, a little 'Closer' reunion. Pretty good flick also some funny moments too."
1,Un-watchable,"Un-watchable is the only word that comes to mind.My wife and I started to watch this movie. After 30 minutes we looked at each other and agreed neither found it interesting.But in all fairness, we told ourselves maybe we were not in the right frame of mind and decided to try it again 2 weeks later.40 minutes into the movie we again agreed not only did it not grab our interest .... it actually discouraged us to watch it.I can't place my finger on it but the film was actually annoying to try and watch .... like a big effort.Everything seemed stiff and forced as though a movie was being made under duress.Very odd."
4,"One of 1992's hottest, sexiest and most sensual Salsa CDs.","On this hot and sexy CD, Johnny Rivera comes through as one of the Salsa Romantica style's best singers. This is music that you can dance to, play in the background as the soundtrack to a romantic candle-lit dinner with a special someone or even during lovemaking in the bedroom. Get this CD and you'll know what I mean."
5,EVERYBODY needs this book!,"EVERY married person, male or female, should read this book. Very well written, interesting, and knowledgable. My husband and I agree that if we would have read this book a year ago, we would not be separated and in counseling. I can't wait to read the rest of her books!"
3,Mongol is unmemorable...,"Although hailed as Barry Sadler's last Casca novel, I personally think Barry checked out way before this one. It was a sad and slow decline of this wonderful and unique series after Book # 14, The Phoenix.After that, there were only a couple of decent reads. The beginning of this one was cool and interesting. The comparison to Conan does not bother me. I always loved Conan! And always thought that Conan and Casca had tons in common.But, unfortunately, this novel let me down. The cover artwork was one of the best, however. It captured what Casca is supposed to look like - weathered and scarred. The artwork was better than the novel."
4,MBV did NOT use keyboards on Loveless!!!!!!!!,"RE: Matt Neutral's review. Get your facts straight, kid. MBV did not use keyboards on Loveless. They did, however, use samples and loops of their own guitar sounds. That may be what's confusing you."
2,Nostalgic with a bit of newness grafted onto it.,"There are aspects of this album that are quite enjoyable. The band certainly has potential. But I can't shake the feeling that this album has been sitting in a vault since 1995, and that it was recently discovered by a producer who liked it and wanted to make it sound modern by remixing it using Nigel Godrich-esq producing techniques. The ""modern"" aspects of this are grafted so awkwardly onto the ""retro"" aspects that it's a bit tough to listen to at times. Nice try though. There's far worse out there."
2,"Eh, is right","If your into music for musicianship this is not your album. If your into Helmet, Failure, Shiner, or anything ""solid"" chances are you won't enjoy this. It's quality for it's genre but this band is to happy and to simple for my tastes. If your into happy music with few dynamics, and not much to think about or analyze, pick this CD up today.Forgive me for being sexist but this is definatelly ""girl rock."""
3,A Passion for Cheese,"Well written, loved the Cannellini Bean Soup with Fontina Gremolata. Not to spicy. Perfect balance.Also had the Twice Roasted Red Peppers with Feta, Capers & Olives. The guests were all over it. Thoughtful recipes easy to make. I would reccomend this book to lovers of cheese"
3,Yuck,"I am doing a production of this show soon, and after listening to this music, i decided it was awful. After learning the actual songs i realized that they were actually good. This cast and the cast of the 1995 cast recording don't do this show justice AT ALL. They all over the place when it comes to their singing, and really is painful to listen to espcially when you know the way they are supposed to sound. Great show, Great music, HORRIBLE singers. Last time I checked a requirement to do musical theatre was that you had to be able to sing, too late for these guys. I only recommend this to people who already know this show or have seen it, if you're just trying to widen your collection of musical theatre, DON'T BUY IT, you will be turned off very quickly."
1,"A great play, a terrible musical!","I saw Blood Brothers in London in July 2007. Being a huge fan of musicals, the show was a real disappointment. However, it is a good play and I would recommend seeing it live if you ever get the chance. In my opinion, the performers were actors who could carry a tune, not singers. The songs are oversimplified and the recurring ""Marilyn Monroe"" theme drove me crazy. The music seems unfinished and written by an real novice at musical theatre. If you want to hear a fantastic musical, buy the WICKED soundtrack. You won't be diappointed!!!"
2,Disapointed in this one,"I am a big fan of Kath Herman's Baxter series which is why I so looked forward to my continuing ""relationship"" with Ellen in Seaport. Unfortunately, this book was a disappointment. I had to really force myself to continue reading it. The characters were, for the most part, annoying and the logistic set-up a little too much like Baxter (i.e., the seafood/diner locale and ""regulars""). It really did not hold my interest and was not nearly as good as any of the Baxter books. I have the second one in the series but am hesitant to read it. Maybe someday when I run out of other ""first reads""....."
2,Black Raw Cut Messenher,"I am extremely disappointed. If you read the reviews, you would think this bag is huge. Well it's not! It can barely pass for a medium size. There's no zipper whatsoever, and it's flimsy. You have to be careful when opening the flap where the buttons are because it can rip off. I think the only good thing about this is the material. It's soft, and can probably withstand some rough wear. Don't buy this if you're looking for space and reliability, you can buy a better bag at a Korean gift store!!"
4,Great 2-line phone!,"Had to stick up for this phone after seeing some low review scores. I work from a home office and have had this phone for at least 5 years. It has all the features I need, solid quality, intuitive buttons that are well laid out, etc. A couple of small items mentioned in earlier reviews are true, like the need to sometimes slow down and make sure to push the buttons. I've actually only experienced this when punching in my SBC voicemail code, so thought it was an issue with their systems. I love this phone."
5,Burgess The Great,"I admit I have a total weakness for anything Anthony Burgess has written, so all you will get here is praise for this novel.Set in the first years of Christianity we have the story according to Burgess of the trials and tribulations of the Apostles counterpointed with the cruelties and depravities of Imperial Rome.Paul is the central figure in the story but it switches over to events involving Caligula and Nero( a couple of very stable individuals!)As well as a great story this is really well researched and there is a history lesson as well.There is a definition of God in the first pages where the narration begins -......perhaps his God was a metaphor of the only thing that will save the world - the exercise of decency, tolerance and humorous scepticism.That would be the best definition/ explanation that I have ever heard.As always with Burgess this is 'bloody good', its such a shame the majority of people only associate him with "" A Clockwork Orange"""
4,Very good for starter,"This Kit works fine, the CD is a bit useless, some save games that i'll never use and some other stuff that for me is useless too. But the case is cool, you can hold up to 4 games in it, it has two protective game holders. Also the car charger is very cool for long trips when the batteries goes off. Also comes with head phones with two exits, where two people can hear on both ears. Overall is very good kit, i only think that the CD is usless."
1,Very bad product,"It is a very very very very very very very very very very very bad product and is not worth it. It depends on you it is not excellent quality.No screen protector, no cleaning fob / wrist lanyard, althouth is listed in the package.When I got the package in I was shocked that it didn't come with the thumb piece! I don't mind the car charger but come on. Can we say FALSE ADVERTISEMENT???????? Never try to buy this product or you were remaining frustrated when you receive it"
3,The case is nice,"The software that came with this item is out-dated and can't be updated like it claims. I can't even get a hold of the manufacturer of the software to figure out how to update it.Other than the software issue, this is a good deal on the case even though I don't see how it can claim to hold up to 8 UMD discs when I can only fit 4 plus one in the PSP itself. They must expect you to slide 2 UMDs into each slot but I'm not gonna take a chance on damaging them.The kit also came with a very flimsy kickstand that I'm not even gonna attach to my PSP that I don't see listed in the written description of the product."
4,Mesh backpack,"Great design, but the straps are a bit scratchy. Size is perfect and you can see the contents at a glance. Speedy delivery."
2,Great design with one serious flaw,"First let me start off by saying I love this bag type. It's the perfect size and shape and even sits just right when it is slung on your back. It fits snugly on your back even full with notebooks, pens and a water bottle with the bottom of the bag barely resting any lower than the small of your back. I would buy another in a heartbeat if they would fix the glaring issue with this bag.The bottom is made of a very cheap nylon and therefore is prone to ripping particularly on the seam where it started. After just a few months of being used daily to carry three 120 page note books, a 32oz water bottle and a handful of pens the nylon torn and now has a fist sized hole, right across the seam. Had they continued the durable mesh fabric across the bottom I doubt I would have any issues. Currently I have duct tape covering the nylon on the bottom and the adjacent seams on an otherwise flawless bag to see if the simple change in fabric was the culprit."
1,Bored all-the-way through!,"This was NOT one of her better books. I was disappointed about the whole plot, but I was happy to see that Mandie has grown up somewhat. I wish she would stop doing things that are wrong and listen to her friends advice. I was bored with this book and had really hoped for a mystery, but I never found one. Hope the next one is better."
1,"Promises, promises","This dictionary has been in the Kindle store for months, status: Real soon now! Publish it or withdraw it!"
1,Where's the info,Why would I buy this without knowing what films are on it? Where's the detail Amazon?
5,Great book!,"Ellie Herman does a great job of clearly explaining the Pilates technique and pointing out common pit-falls. Very useful for instructors....everything at the tip of your fingers: instructions, photos, troubleshooting. Worth every penny!"
3,Good Camera for PC's ONLY!!,"I got this camera as a Christmas present and loved it for awhile until my Dell broke and I finally got a new Mac!! I was surprised to find out that that this camera does NOT work with Mac's unfortunately. Now I can't even use it because burning to a DVD and then bringing it into iMovie reduces the quality so much, it's not even worth the hassle. When I used this camera on my dell, it worked perfectly though so no worries there!Despite it not working on Mac's, I have to say I was NOT impressed with the image quality. The auto focus is constantly searching and the manual focus doesn't work too well. I've used Sony MiniDV cameras and they are SOO much better for image quality. It's a good camera for anyone taking simple video and not taking too much action shots. Okay Camera, but there's better ones for your money out there."
2,Got Turned off on the Catholic Bashing,"The story line was weak, for a Gilbert Morris Book and I was disappointed with his take on the Catholic Church. If one doesn't know all the facts about another faith, one should leave those facts out completely. I got hung up on those parts of the book and they really left me feeling like I wanted to write the author and tell him before he writes another book and refers to Catholicism, he should read ""Crossing the Tiber"" by Stephen K. Ray. He also was Baptist when he wrote the book and his incites into church history are very valuable to any lay person and I would think especially a writer."
1,L'air du Temps Toilette Spray,The product is not up to the standards of the same product that I have purchased at department stores and even drug stores. The box and the bottle was cheaply made and is more like a product you would find at a perfume discount store. The spray doesn't smell like the Nina Ricci that I have used for more then 15 years and it doesn't last very long. The cap won't stay on the bottle. I will not purchase this product again except at the department store where I work or the drug store where I have purchased itwith complete satisfaction. I made sure it was the exact same thing before I purchased it.
3,Entertaining,"How can there always be nothing on television? Our family enjoyed this show. Enjoyable magic, especially the close-up hand work.However, the lack of commercials really highlighted the formula for these kinds of shows. They have a tendency to forecast and review at each commercial break. ""Coming up after the break"" a one minute clip of what's coming up next, ""Previously.."" followed by a 1 minute clip taken from the 5 minutes of actual program you just saw, followed 5 min of new program which contains the 1 minute of ""coming up after the break"" and then a new ""coming up after the break"". They are just redundant material. I think this could be re-edited to take those out as well for a better product."
5,OPI Malaysian Mist,"I was so anxious to try this new color. By the time I received it, the bottle was in pieces and it was a big mess. The color seemed like a nice soft peachy color."
4,A nice pale pink.,"I purchased this color pretty much for my mother. She's not big into nail polish, and would only wear a more neutral color. She thought it was a pretty color. It's kind of sheer, so I'd use two coats. Also, it was a lot more runny than I thought it was going to be. I've never purchased Opi before, and have always had cheap, childish nail polish. It's nice not being able to scrape the nail polish off with my fingernail within one day of applying! It dried at a good speed, and I'd say it is worth the price. In the future, I think I'll purchase more of this brand!"
1,Don't waste your money,"I brought this stereo for my 9 year old daughter for Christmas. I didn't want to spend alot of money-- basically just wanted something cool-looking for her to play music in her room. I wasn't too concerned about the name brand or quality. I hoped it would last a year or so-- knowing she would outgrow it and want an expensive system later. After some delay, we finally took it out of the box. We starting having problems immediately. The CD player eventually opens after you press the button 4-5 times. The CD won't start when you press play, but sometimes begins spinning when you're not near it. I've never written a review before, but always read them. I felt compelled to write because I would have never bought this machine had I known of the many problems."
2,Don't waste your money,I bought this headset to use for conference calls using my computer. The bad design of the mic means pushing the mute button so others on the conference call don't hear me. Who wants to hold the mute button down for an hour or two? I'm going to try to get my money back.
3,ROSIE IS DEFINETLY THE SUPERSTAR WE HAVE COME TO EXPECT,"I have followed Rosies' career for many years. It seems that every year she gets beter and better. This cd is a very good cd. She sings her songs in a very entertaning manner. This cd has the songs of Johnny Mercer, that's good. The only regret i have about this cd, is that Rosie didn't choose more hit songs by Johnny. John Oddo, Rosies' musical director,did a great job on the arrangements. I would strongly recommend this cd."
3,If you like synthesizer music...,"Why can't baby einstein use real music on their cd's? I really don't like the fake music made from a synthesizer or what have you. I'd rather buy real music for my baby to listen to. Otherwise the music is soft and soothing, if you don't mind the fake sound."
1,Disappointed,"I know I bought a used item and some usage is to be expected. but this book was in pretty bad shape, almost every page had underlined sections with highlighting, there were handwritten comments on many, many pages. the comments on the pages are literally overpowering the actual text there were notes and pieces of paper in the book. If I can find another copy somewhere I will, as this will not be enjoyable reading to me. I have never had a used book in this bad a shape from any vendor. They should not have charged for this at all. But that is not even the point. I rather pay for a new book (if I could have found one) than read this used book."
3,Ok Step Routine,"Admittedly, it took me a while to figure out the routine Ms. Freidriche uses in her video. I usually work out about an hour doing step and other exercises, and I found once I got the drift of what was being attempted in this workout, that I could work up a bit of a sweat but not an excessive one.Having grown up on the Gin Miller approach with it's tapping and repetition, focusing more on working out all the muscles as possible, I found Friedrich's routine more difficult but less satisfying from a workout perspective. I will still use it from time to time in order to vary my workouts, but as a bread and butter workout, I found it lacking."
1,Suuuuuucks on a Mac,"Costs $10 less at CompUSA right now. But ... no matter because this reader ... is ...NOT... recognized on a Macbook Pro 2.2 running Tiger 10.4.10. Also could not get it to work on Parallels 3 using Windows XP on the same computer. At least under parallels the LED flashes, but the virtual drives for each slot only loaded after unplugging the USB cable! To get it to work you will need to *trick* it into working.Stay away Maczealots. Sony is too smart to be compatible. Also, bet it won't mount under Ubuntu. Can't test until back from vacation."
4,Superb in hot weather,"Fitting nicely on my B width feet with medium arches, these are extremely comfortable and the most ventilated court shoes I've ever worn. The ventilation screens that wrap around the bottom of shoe means your feet don't get hot and sweaty even when playing on hard courts on 95 degree days. Don't expect to wear them when it's wet outside or your feet will get drenched. Also love the bumpy laces as they never come undone during play. Only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is that soles don't last as long as Goodyear soles on Prince QT2's did before they discontinued that shoe. However, I just ordered another pair of Glaciator's for this summer's tennis season."
3,"""We sold our bodies. Why can't we sell some wood?""","""Bad Girls"" is an okay Western -- it's basically a female version of ""Young Guns.""The film starts in a brothel in Echo City, Colorado. Mary Stuart Masterson is being assaulted by a drunken Colonel. Madeline Stowe shoots him. A lynch mob tries to hang Stowe. Masterson and her pals Drew Barrymore and Andie MacDowell save her, skip town, and decide to go to Oregon to create a lumber mill. Some Pinkerton detectives chase after them. On the way, they get kidnapped by mean ex-boyfriends, caught up in some bank robberies, an Army weapons deal, and Dermot Mulroney catches them swimming naked. If any of that sounds like fun, you'll probably enjoy the film.In memory of Milton Friedman (July 31, 1912 - November 16, 2006) and my free lunch in 1999."
4,"Hello, wake up, GREAT movie !!","This movie, Bad Girls, provided an up close and personnal view of women not as the stereotypical house wife, but as outlaws, as a contradiction to the international degrading view of women. This is something different, new in a sense, and therefore, good. The acting involved is great all things considered. Think otherwise, you try and do better. Yeah, Sandra Bullock would have been great here, but that's ok, we'll make do w/ Drew, Madeline, and Andie, right ? :)"
1,Junk!,This movie isn't worth your time or cost even for free very dumb just made to diplay this group of women.
3,A lame attempt at ultra-feminst reactions.,"As a woman, I can tell you that I am embarassed to say that these woman our from the same gender as I. One of the characters was willing to flirt with a man just to take advantage of him. Woman have come a long way and this movie sets us back a step or two. It also showed men at their worst element. The fact that one of the male characters excepted one of the females to engage in sexual contact was appaling and offensive to any woman who has a shred of dignity. This is why I am a lesbian and proud of it. So to all potential women watchers out there, please do not see this movie."
1,Faded Love,"When we first got this percolator about 6 months ago, we loved it. Recently it started popping the ground fault plug in the kitchen and we had to move it into the dining room to make the coffee. We discovered it has a slow leak below the handle. If you fill it up the night before and plug it in the next morning, there's water underneath it. But even if we wait until morning it still pops the plug, and no amount of drying off the leaking water seems to help. This has become a huge hassle and now I'm shopping for another one."
1,Not a good value,"I was very disappointed in this boxed set. The movies, of course, are great but this boxed set was a big rip off. The only reason I didn't return it was because I promised someone my original copies of the first two movies. I already own the first two Harry Potter movies in their beautiful cardboard slipcovers. I was expecting this boxed set to have some continuity. Instead all they did was put the third movie (in a plastic case!) in a fancy box with the first two movies in their original (cardboard!) packaging. If you already own the first two movies do not waste your money buying this set. Just buy the third movie. You can always find your own box to put them in. If you want a boxed set, wait five or six years until all of the movies are released and buy it then. Maybe the packaging will be better. Yes Wolf, the third movie is in a plastic slip case not the nicer cardboard slipcase."
3,Very good exept for 3,I rate this 3 stars because Harry potter 3 detracts so much.so just buy 1 or/&2 NOT 3
4,The package is not consistent,"I like having the packaged but de last movie comes in plastic , and I am colleting this stuff, I thought the three of them would come in the same material, I recommend, amazon to make them in all in carton or in plastic."
2,Limited,"Although it might serve as a decent cross-reference book in a situation where details aren't necessary, this is a poor ""stand alone."" Out of 26 varities, I was only able to locate 7...references steer clear of anything out of the ordinary, and if note is made on them, it's by name only...no specifics. I was somewhat disappointed by the frequent ""tips,"" which entailed more common sense practises than anything useful - even for novice like myself."
2,Not recommended for house with kids,This looks very nice. I had to admit. But it is really not recommended when you have little kids who can move around chair and scratch the leather. I bought it because I saw 5 star. I realized a year that it was the worst purchase. The chair was easy to assemble. But few months later it started loosen up it's legs. The bottom cover started to came off and fillin inside chair started falling. Initially I kept tighting the chair legs to use but at last I had to give up and throw the chairsaway. Very poor quality of faux leather. Overall worse chair that I have seen.
5,HAPPY FEET!!!!!!,"I dare anyone to sit still while listening to this CD. If you play it in your living room, you might as well move the furniture. The pulsating rhythums, the solid percussions and of course the sound of one of the greatest Sonero's brings together a huge musical treat. It never slows down, Oscar DeLeon is at his masterful best. Enjoy, Enjoy, Enjoy!!!"
4,The Riffs-Underground Kicks,"What an uncompromizing CD cover. These guys play punk rock with all the Sex Pistols,Johnny Thunders and Mick Ronson riffs mashed together to make what, great Riffs.The singer is a droner/shouter in the U.K. Subs vain but it's the guitars that rock and snarl,and you realize this is kick-ass music."
3,A very good read. A thorough analysis of Soul Travel.,"Complete, and documents the struggles and difficulties that one faces when reaching for higher levels of consciousness. It would seem that Mr. Wilson makes Soul Travel harder than it really is, but then, each person's experience is different. Just the same, I have never known anyone that had to work so hard to experience Soul Travel. Recommended reading for those interested in Eckankar, members of Eckankar, or those who are interested in experiencing themselves as Soul: Immortal, eternal, and indestructable"
4,sweet teacher book,In this story we see a little boy who is writing a story about his teacher. He thinks that she is the best and can teach anyone! He starts off by saying that she can teach an astronaut to float in space. He goes through each letter of the alphabet naming a person that he teach could teach to do their job.This was a simple picture book that can teach young children lots of things. They will see that teachers are important people.This book is recommend for a story time read aloud. There are lots of fun things to look at on each page. Young children will learn the basic concepts of the alphabet and be introduced to lots of occupations through this simple picture book.
5,Stories to make us more than we were before...,"A wonderful, inspiring and diverse collection of stories. Don't worry if you heart gets broken every now and then as you read...you'll also be healed and emerge stronger and better than you ever were before."
5,Thoughtful and funny,"To be honest, I don't read very many business books but a friend recommended this one and I'm glad I read it. It's a quick, fun read, and is both comforting and inspiring. I highly recommend this to anyone who is looking for a little nudge in the right direction, or who just wants to do or be better than they are now."
2,not worth 100$,Pretty cheaply made. Remember to buy file folders as well. You also have to screw the handles on.
3,A touching remembrance of a Jewish child's life in Slovakia.,"I liked this book even though I didn't rate it highly.Breznitz did a good job detailing his life in wartime Slovakia and his placement in a Catholic orphanage. His troubles surviving the war are touching. No one should be made to feel this sense of tragedy. What got in the way was Shlomo's rationalizing in the book. Some of these thoughts confused me because they made it hard to follow the story.This book is a good read detailing the suffering of one person. However there are better books out there. If one wants to read about the Holocaust, there are some great books out there such as the Diary of Anne Frank."
5,Pilates - Your Health,"I have been studying the Pilates Method for about 3 years now. This book along with ""Return to Life Through Contrology"" has enabled me to more fully understand the Pilates method of exercise. It is not just exercise - it is a way of life. If you are a beginner it would be wise to choose one of the newer books to help you get started but, I would also purchase this book and Return to Life Through Contrology so that you can more fully understand the principals behind the method. I refer to my copies often for information and instruction. These are small, paperback, black and white books...but, they pack a great deal of information into their little package!"
5,(pre-Corel) JASC Paint Shop Pro 9,"It is a shame Corel bought this package. They are doing nothing but trying to kill it. It was too good for them to compete with. But that is typical with software companies. They buy out their competitors to kill the competition. I own 3 versions of Jasc Paint Shop Pro it is a great graphics, photography, art package and I have never been disappointed. Version 9 was the last upgrade to be produced by Jasc, if you can get it grab it. I also recommend the Paint Shop Pro 9 manual."
1,would not buy it,I did not buy this book because the Look Inside pages put me off. In the table on page 61 the food cost made no sense relative to the menu price and the profit margin was shown in dollars instead of as a percentage. If the author doesn't know the difference between profit margin and mark-up he should not be writing a management book.
1,dissatisfied,will never order from amazon again have sent many request for return address and how to get my money back never got response the back pak had a little zipper which only fit a pencil in it it was a gift for my grandson to carry things in very dissatisfied on return policy
4,VERY MAGIC FELLOW,"Wonderful slice of eastern influenced psychedelica. I don'tpretend to be an expert on this man's music, but I do know whatI like, and I like this very much. It rates up there with thelikes of SUNSHINE SUPERMAN. It is a great piece of psychedelicrock history. Not a bad song on this one. Again I leave off thatfifth star only because the sound quality reproduction is notup to todays standards. This man, as with the sun, is indeeda very magic fellow.Thanks, and ever lasting peace to all,Tom"
4,YOU SHOULD OWN THIS!!!!!!!!!,"SAW 'EM LIVE, SOCIALIZED WITH THEM, MY FRIEND BOUGHT THE CD, WE LISTEN TO IT EVERY TIME WE PARTY. FIST PUMPING, OI CHANTING ENJOYMENT!!!!! THEY ROCK."
5,Better photo never published!,"The quality of World Press Photos is getting better each year, but the subjects entering and dominating each category is also changing (toward more human-aspects, dailylife and war, less politics) and there is an enormous difference between the WPP from the 19-eighties and I think this edition (2000) is the best ever, even better than 2001. Some professional Danish photographers dominate this Millenium-edition with war-photos from several places on The Balkan so emotional that I've cried over some photographs for the first time ..... the best photobook on my shelf. Looking foreward to see what will enter from this sorrowfull autumn."
1,Nice gadget - horrible software support.,"The unit itself is well designed. The quality of video is fair, at least for such a compact unit. Photos are near worthless due to horrible quality. My cell phone has far superior images.Sadly, for all the niceties of the gadget Panasonic chose to cripple the unit with it's software and make it virtually worthless.a) the videos ARE NOT mpeg4 as advertised. Rather, they are encapsulated in an .asf DRM file which is unviewable by anyone.b) the voice recorder is fairly useless. Sure it's a digital voice recorder. But nothing can play the digital files it records but the camera. You have no way of converting them or playing them on your PC.Due to the software implementation this camera because mostly non-functional.Today I have several videos that I cannot view. You need a special plug-in. That said, Panasonic doesn't let you download without a special code.THIS IS NOT A MPEG4 CAMERA AS ADVERTISED"
4,"Fascinating, intelligent and FUNNY!","I drove my wife nuts with this book. Each night as we both lay in bed reading I would interrupt her at least 3-4 times with, ""Holy cow! That's where that came from?"" or ""So that's what that means!""For anyone who fancies themself a wordsmith or loves language or even enjoys knowing why things are the way they are ""The Mother Tongue"" is a gem. You'll find yourself scratching your head and thinking, ""There are people who keep track of this stuff?"" At the same time you are so grateful that they did.Bryson has an engaging and familiar feel to his writing. Very enjoyable to read with a knack for explaining the things you always wanted to understand."
2,Do not trust the facts in this book,"This book is a quick read -- entertaining and light -- but no one should trust the facts that are tossed around in it. Bryson's knowledge of languages other than English is shaky at best, and he makes countless mistakes in his various attempts at translation. He also has a very superficial understanding of grammar (as evinced by Chapter 9). On p. 142, he claims that petroleum has both Latin and Greek roots, ""(Latin petro + Greek oleum),"" but it is the opposite: petra is Greek and oleum is Latin. Not a big deal of course, but this book is literally peppered with inaccuracies such as this one. I wish someone had fact-checked this book, because it could have been a valuable tool. As it is, the information is often imprecise, or just plain wrong."
3,Bryson on language,"In his typical readable style, Bryson tells the story of the English language, including chapters on pronunciation, language variation, spelling, usage, names, wordplay, language policy, and dictionaries."
2,"A slap-dash, badly written book","I love the writing of Bill Bryson and so it pains me to pan him but this book, while absolutely delightful, does play fast and loose with the facts. It feels like dear Bill put more of his energies into being clever and amusing rather than knuckling down to some hard research. An example? Bryson states that ""Estimates of the number of languages in the world usually fix on a figure of about 2,700..."" Ethnologue currently lists 6912 living languages in the world. I doubt that 4200+ languages were discovered between 1990 (when this was originally published) and today.I picked this up because I've really enjoyed Bryson's other works, especially his first-person travelogues. I think I'd better stick with those. I wish I hadn't invested in this."
3,Entertaining,"Interesting book but as other reviewers have noted, there are many points in which I question the research. That said, I did enjoy learning about the history of the English language and the many twists and turns language has taken over the centuries. The decline and disappearance of so many languages, including Manx, the language of my ancestors, is documented, reminding us of the fragility of the spoken and written word. Amusing and entertaining."
3,watch your sources,"The book swings, but has an element of Ripley's Believe or not to it. When I was a graduate student in linguistics way back in 1964 I was graded down from an A to a B for quoting the ""charlatan"" Mario Pei, The Story of English, 1948. Bryson is still using him in 1998. I was planning on using Mother Tongue for a class, but its scholarship is suspect. Lots of fun for the lay reader."
4,"Good Quality, questionable depth","The bowl is good quality for the price, however, it is much broader and more shallow than expected. I use this for dog food as opposed to water, which works better for me. The rubber ring at the bottom comes easily off mine, which is nice if you decide to throw it in the dishwasher."
4,not as good as original rocky horror.. but still awesome,"I thought it was kewl, no one can beat the original rocky horror though, but for a remake of it I found it awesome!!!"
1,Disappointed,"I'm a huge fan of RHPS as well as a fan of all different types of punk music. I heard this album and was greatly disappointed in it. There were some alright songs but a majority of them were horribly done, ESPECIALLY the Time Warp. I definately do not recommend this to anyone, save your money."
3,Getting Gotti,"This movie was good, but it's definitly not a ""GoodFellas"" or a ""Sopranos""!!I rate this dvd a 3 of 5 stars!!"
5,Nice!,"I had read on one of the reviews, that it wasn't polished chrome, well it is! Heavy metal, chrome. Works as well as any classic Swingline stapler. Very happy, but it does show fingerprints."
5,"A great book of prayers, taken from the Word!!!","Every time I visit Dr. & Pastor Dufresne's Church out in Murrietta I get blessed. Dr. Ed Dufresne has a God given gift of healing, and this book has verses that you can pray and speak, and as Mark 11 says it will come to pass, when you pray, believe and speak it out. This book will bless your life. I read it daily, along with my Bible."
5,Two words-READ IT!,Do you love to see what Amelia Peabody Emerson will dig up next? Does Emerson thrill you? Do you long to know what happens to Ramses (and the cat Bastet)? What will become of the rest of the family-including Anubis? This is a welcome book from Elizabeth Peters-the Amelia legend is continuing to grow. The summer's still young-READ IT
3,Not one of Peter's best...,"I am a loyal fan of the Amelia Peabody mysteries but this one was a struggle to get through. I found her style to be similar to her earliest novels...the usual underdeveloped characters of the ""bad guys"" and any dialogues too long and dry. I actually bought ""Seeing a Large Cat"" before this one and found that it really came after one I had missed (hence me reading The Hippotomus Pool now!) For any discouraged readers...keep going! The next in the series is absolutely amazing!"
1,There is no humor in verbosity,"This is the first book I have read by Peters so the many references to other books was lost on me. I found Peters dialogue annoying. Her husband's constant use of ""Errrr"" and ""Hmmm"" and the son's supposedly comical verbosity got on my nerves. The characters were extremely one dimensional and very unlikable. I failed to find any humor in any of it and the so called mystery remains to be one to me since the ending involved a character from another book. I would have liked to have taken Peobody's umbrella and whacked it over Peter's head. Sorry loyal fans."
1,Thumbs down,"There were so many wonderful possibilities and none came to fruition. The greatest part was seeing the family back together and having Ramsesback in the action - unfortunately that was not enough. Perhaps the lack of a compelling antagonist was what made this novel a flop... or perhaps the mystery was boring... or perhaps it was the fact that though it could have been an emotionally charged, possibly exciting, even highly romantic novel, it was not. I made myself read this to the end in the hopes that Sethos would rescue it... this was sadly not the case. Not sure if I'll continue reading this series because this one was such a disappointment. Part of me wants to continue because I'm curious about Ramses - his character is just a lot of fun but I'm beginning to wonder if the last novel may have been the best. Perhaps if there was a one and a half stars I may have given it that but definitely not two stars. I feel a bit cheated out of my valuable time. So disappointed!"
1,SIZE?????!!!!!,UMM... where is the size!?! this is extremely aggravating to me that there is no size gallon wise or even dimensions! Not only for just this tank but every single freaking tank or even product from stupid petco!
4,We love this guy...........,"My husband and I are Natives Southern Californians and we never heard of Rudy Moreno, but we saw him at a comedy show at 4th and B a local nightclub and bought his CD. We have not stopped playing it, we play it for our friends and families and we really enjoy his TRUE to life stories, they are really funny and we related to everything, from drinking at 18 to getting married and having kids.He reminds me of Bill Cosby in his tales.I'm 46 and I find his humor not only funny to me, but my kids ages 19 and 22 respectively love him as well."
4,Book condition,"Very pleased with the purchase. Very good condition, and it's the same version my kids remember! The youngest is 17 and it was her fav story when she was a pre schooler!!"
4,Fantastic spy-thriller!,"I got this from a friend who didn't want it anymore bec. she feels that now that the Cold War is over, references to it in print are not politically correct. On the other hand, my only complaints about this book is that it lacks sex scenes."
1,American Recorder Sensor Swabs Nikon Canon,"the swabs do not hold the pressure.the soft tissue release the tiny hair and adds up dirt onto the sensor.not re-usable.. overpriced for its quality..i'd rather use the Wooden Cotton Swabs.I have 3 Nikon D3s and need to clean the sensors quite often....This is not a solution...very desertification...i bought 2 packs and Adorama refused to take them back...i am loosing $20, Adorama lost $2,200. I just bought another 24-70 Nikkor and SB-900 from B&H;."
1,I find all the high reviews incomprehensible,"What gives with all the 5 star reviews? Many of the reviewers look like they are good readers apart from this one, but I find the strong reviews incomprehensible. I love Dylan, the Beats, Joyce, Henry Miller, Lawrence Durrell, and a host of avant-garde and Bohemian writers, so I feel I have some cred on this kind of book. But I cannot find much of value in this particular book. I thought it was primarily boring and tedious, and couldn't find any of the humor others here write about. To me it came across as a piece of self-indulgent writing by an inexperienced author.I'm quite sad that Farina died so young, and I wish he had lived long enough to develop his writing (and music), but I have to say that based on this, I can't find much to admire. I find him to be weak as a prose stylist and dreadful at characterization."
5,"""where you're going is where you've never been""","I could write a raving review of this book and never finish pointing out all its highest qualities. I read it first when I found it in a pile of my dad's old college texts. I haven't put it down since. The cover, front and back, is completely gone, and the binding has been taped several times, but this book will never die. It only depresses me that this author didn't get a chance to write more. If there is any advice I can offer anyone my own age, it is to read this book."
2,A Boring Attempt,"Although the ending was a surprise, the book is much too long. Ms Gutman could have cut back 1/2 of the book and it would have flowed much better. Unrealistic, at times boring, I kept hoping. Reminded me of an English literature class where you have to count the words in order to comply with the professor's instructions, thereby making the story MUCH too long...and boring."
1,lumbar strap does not function- Company not helpful,I am very dissapointed with this. I received as a shower gift before my daughter was born. By the time she was old enough to safely use this (she is now 14 months and 20 lbs) we discovered that the strap that goes around your waist (so called infinately adjustable) does not stay in place and in unable to support weight on your hips. This puts alot us stress on your neck and shoulders. I called the company and they said they would do nothing because it was out of the 90 day warrenty. I should have bought the Kelty. It is more money but at least I would not have wasted $100! Hope your experience is better
2,Not worthy,"Product arrived in a hurry and was easy to install. Having used these on other vehicles I was excited at getting ready to increase my mileage and horsepower as well as listening to the ""whistle"" this product usually causes your vehicle to produce. After installation on a 5.7 liter Dodge Charger however I was disappointed. No extra sound and no additional power or fuel economy.Yep, usually a great item but if you own a Chrysler/Dodge 5.7 product you would be better off spending the money on something else."
3,great game that ties in with the show,"This game provides the events leading up to the Eureka Seven show. You play Sumner Sturgeon, who's ultimate goal is to provide the mech named Nirvash typeZero to Holland and his crew. The graphics are great, but the gameplay gets a little repetitive after a while. It seems they could've spent more time developing the game (I noticed several small things like music tracks resetting every time a camera angle changed). If you like the show, you'll probably like this game. The controls for the mechs are layed out well, and I only wish there was a multiplayer mode."
1,Didn't work for me,I have had a number of severe green algae blooms (outbreaks) in my 30 gal tank. This product did not help at all.
5,atom and his package,This album is great! it sounds so much better off of a cd that the computer. I highly recomend it!
5,C'mon people!!!!,"Ok first off...I've heard all the comparisons to weird al and ween. Atom is not only funnier, but way less PC than the two above. Come on!! He pokes fun of his being a jew all the time, what's not to like? If you don't like atom, then obviously you have no sense of humor."
5,A Memorable Analytical Greek Lexicon,"This lexicon is a powerful instrument in the study and analisys of the helenic language, particularly in The New Testament. I recommend this precious book to all students who enjoy to learn one of the original languages of The Holy Bible. God Bless you all !"
5,A memorable story,"The Phantom of the Opera is a fantastic book that got such a hold of me that I couldn't let it out of my hands once I started reading it. I recommend it for the great plot, the impressive characters and the addictive writing style."
5,A true classic and a benifit too one's soul to read.,"I suspected no movie or even the play had done justice to the 'Phantom of the Opera'. But after reading the book I now know just how much of and injustice was done. The book is filled with characters that waste no time in comeing to life in the readings minds. The plot is such that I was not able to put it down and read the book in just two sittings. So intranced the reader becomes the you are with Raul and Christian as they play about the halls of the Opera house. You are there within the dark dowls of the opera, traped with Christian, fighting alongside Raul and the Persian, Hateing the Phantom and then weeping with him when he discovers how one truly loves. Such an experiance is it, that when you finish and close the book you will fill a lose such a story had to end"
4,Love It!!!!,"I am 14 (going on 15) and i have read this book but i already knew about this story. My school is doing the play and when we read it i loved the dramatics of it and that the phantom has a evil yet very loving side of him. it is some what romantic yet mysterious story, and its a story i can read over and over again!"
5,The Phantom of the Opera,A great book! I highly reccomend it to anyone who has the ability to read. An exquisite blend of thrilling suspense and romance. I loved it!
3,Could he have possibly read the book?,"Is it possible that ""a reader from Prince Edward Island, Canada"" could have actually read Gaston Leroux's ""Phantom of the Opera"" and still have concluded his review by attributing it to ""that creative talent, Andrew Lloyd Weber?""Andrew Lloyd Weber is, in fact, very talented and creative, and his Phantom IS memorable. but Weber DIDN'T write the book, and his Phantom is only very loosely based on Leroux's Phantom. I'd suggest reading the book and knowing who wrote it before heaping praise on it.There are a lot of interesting things one could say about the book, but you really ought to know what they are and who wrote it before you review it."
5,My favorite book,"This story is a mystery and love story, so I like this story very much. The main characters are Eric(phantom), Raoul and Christine. In the beginning two people were killed by the phantom, because they talked about him or didn't listen to advice. Christine was a good singer. Raoul fell in love with her. But Erick loved her, too. Eric proposed to her. She said, ""Yes. I love you, Erick "" and kissed to him. He was very glad and said, ""You are free."" At last, Erick disappeared, and nobody knew where Christine and Raoul were. Erick's face is very ugly. So, everyone doesn't love him. He is a very poor person. I think mystery and opera fans would like this story."
5,Entertaining!,"This book has suspense, comedy(at parts), and romance.It was so good I read it in two days! You'll be pulled in by the characters and the page-turning suspense in this book."
5,"Emotionally gripping; A fascinating, complex narrative.","This story of a disfigured genius driven to insanityencompasses its readers in an atmosphere of grandeur andterror, love and betrayal, and the immortal flavor of an erathat has past. This novel has convinced me that there reallywas an Opera Ghost. It will draw you into the world of Erik,his cleverness, and his unrequited love for the beautifulChristine Daae. But there is so much more to this tragictale, with every imaginable twist and turn, you will not beable to put this book down. The delightful cast of characterswill make you want to read it again and again. If you likedthe musical, you will surely want to own a copy of the novel."
2,Yawn,"If you're looking for something special, keep looking, because you won't find it here. I suppose most people come to this book nowadays with Michael Crawford, Lon Chaney or Claude Rains in mind, the but story here is completely different. What it is is a fairly dull detective story, with no love story in it at all, and flatly unconvincing characters and a highly improbable plot. If you love the Lloyd-Weber opera like I do, don't expect to find anything sublte or beautiful here. This is one of the few cases when the films and musicals FAR outdo the original that they were based on."
2,Great book and its for free!,I love this book. My only disappointment is that it ended. :( other than that…this book is a joy to read. I couldn't put it down
4,Good story,I loved the movie and the book was even better. I love that the classics are free on amazon. If you like the movie you will love the book!
5,Excellent,This is one of the gifts that my son got. He absolutely loved it. We have been listening to it since he recieved it
1,picture doesn't portray product,"i bought the mold because i couldn't find it in stores and needed it asap. from the looks of the picture i thought i had purchased a nice metal mold that would last for awhile. when the package showed up, it was a cheap, very thin piece of clear plastic. since i needed it, i used it and it worked well but i have my doubts as to how long it will last."
4,NICE WORK,"At times the novel, with its lovely use of metaphor and synonym read more like poetry than prose. Certain settings, such as the Bius Basilica and the dungeon where Panla was held prior to her ascendence and after it was renovated, were particularly visual, as were the various morphings of people and planets.I also chuckled over the play on names such as Baloni, Rabbel Mennis, Trullop, Pigue, Egs Bloyt, and all the others.One of the scenes I particularly enjoyed was with Panla and the old man in the nursing home.The cover, both front and back are eye catching and beautifully drawn. In addition, they reflect the tone and the subject (religion, deviltry, time travel, magic, SF) of the novel.Author Templeman, (interesting name considering the subject matter and his penchant for bastardizing names) is a skilled writer and an accomplished story teller...the book offers a smorgasbord of food for thought and it would be a shame to miss it. Nice work."
5,Exceptional Vise,"I am a woodworker, but find I need a machinist's vise from time-to-time for modifying or constructing hardware components. I bought this when the price was exceptionally low. It arrived in PERFECT condition considering its weight through Fedex Ground. It is a very well constructed and finished product and is VERY heavy with strong jaws. The vise action is extremely smooth and the jaws have virtually no play. The jaws close with a very slight gap, but I haven't spent any time adjusting them yet. I recently used this vise to install copper plumbing for compressed air in my shop. It was invaluable holding assemblies for soldering. I highly recommend this vise to anyone. You will not be disappointed."
5,"Beautiful, shimmering, spacey, lovely, emotional music!","Spiritualized is one of my favorite bands (along with Dead Can Dance, the Verve, the Orb, the Beatles, Pink Floyd, and the Stones), and this is their best CD. Nobody else can sound so lovely yet so challenging, so close yet so far into the outer realms of space. If you want to get high without drugs, put this in the CD player, sit back, turn off the lights, and float into space. You won't be disappointed."
2,Just a story,"I can't tell you that this is a bad book, I can't tell you that is a waist of time, but also I can't tell you that this is an excellent read, the book will keep you reading but not thrilling you, the problem is when Reb said that he knew the answer of The Circles of Truth because Da Vinci told him how to solve the puzzle, since there, and that the last one hundred pages are just to waist paper you will only read the rest of it to finish the book, if you have an other book read it instead of this one."
2,"A poor man's ""Da Vinci Code""","The dialogue alone was nearly enough to make me want to put down the book. Concept was intriguing, but the characters are all more like caricatures, and the twists and turns and loose threads are forced to fit together as the book draws to a close. The best thing about the book was that it was fairly short."
3,Not as good as the others,"My one year old LOVES Baby Moves and Baby's Day, but she won't watch this one...I think it's not as simple to understand and clear as the others, harder to follow for a baby."
2,Not engaging enough for my child,"I was really attracted to the ""musical"" aspect of this video but for some reason it fails to capture the interest of my 1 year old. Also I find the music a bit irritating and I've definitely heard my fair share of toy box type music through other videos."
3,OK DVD,"I bought this DVD for my daughter after reading reviews raving about how good it is. My 1-year-old daughter enjoys the ""Baby Genius"" series because of all the singing, dancing, & children interaction in the video & I thought that this would be similiar. I was wrong. This video contains songs & interactions but they seem a bit too mellow. My daughter was into it for about 5 minutes watching the parents & babies interacting but soon lost interest.I guess if your babies love listening to classical music, talking or soft songs & just people/baby watching than they might enjoy this. This is not the case for my girl so that's why I'm giving it 3 stars only."
4,I'll never understand why . . .,"people feel the urge to risk their lives in endeavors like this one! I had to wonder about the incredible amount of money that must go to re-enact such a dangerous voyage, too. But the story makes fascinating reading. A first-person account of sailing some of the most treacherous seas in the world really brings out the dangers faced--involuntarily--by Ernest Shackleton and his men.One change I wish for the book: a detailed map comparing Fuchs' journey with Shackleton's. Fuchs mentions several options Shackleton might have taken, but without a map, I can't see them for myself. Otherwise, this is a very readable (though I did have trouble with nautical terms, not being a sailor myself) and interesting addition to the literature of polar adventure."
1,It's alright,"You will find this cd good only if your into freestyle music, he is very talented but by no means is he the king of freestyle sorry but george lamond does not even come close to matching The real king of freestyle Stevie B's skills their popularity in the music business speaks for it's self. George never realy blew up, like i said the album is good but not high quality so don't be suprised if you don't like it."
2,No fit sheets,"The description of these sheets did not specify the actual size so they did not fit our matress after receipt. Luckily we have another bed that we can use them on. I will not order any more sheets from Amazon unless the actual size, in inches, is specified."
3,Sandi Patty *Is* The Voice,"This is a wonderful opportunity to get to hear Sandi Patty in a non-Jesusy setting. She's the only person singing today who is consistently in tune. Any opera singer should listen to Sandi Patty if she wants to learn phrasing and delivery of a song. Unfortunately, this disc is marred by Kathy Troccoli's wide warble and smoked-too-many-cigarettes ""delivery"". Program the CD to skip the Troccoli moments, and you've got some gorgeous listening ahead of you. It's definitely worth having. Monarch Records, if you're reading this: please ask Sandi to record some more of this stuff! She puts all of her contemporaries' interpretations of these standards to shame. Brava, Sandi!"
1,Terrible edition!,"Quicksand and Passing are two incredible novellas from an under-taught and under-valued writer, Nella Larsen. I encourage everyone to read this book.HOWEVER this edition by Wilder Press is terrible. If you are a student, teacher, or someone who cares about the quality of your books, I advise AGAINST this copy. It has random paragraph breaks in the middle of sentences, multiple typos, and absolutely no extra-textual information - no introduction, no information on how the text was edited - nothing. Most importantly, it omits the epigraph - a section of a Langston Hughes poem that really sheds light on the overall themes of the novels.If you want a better quality (and probably cheaper) read, go with the Rutgers University Press edition. Buying this version of the text was a complete waste of my money, as I'll be selling it and buying the Rutgers UP edition."
5,Mind Blowing,"Packed full of new information on the 911 attacks and what could have been, like the fact that they were intended to be a nuclear attack!!! Where else do you read that, or the incredible story of Glass! Just a solid book, and one of the few that covers (in my opinion) the most credible evidence that 911 was an inside job--the CIA-ISI connection."
3,You will never run out...,"This box is huuuuge. The size of the box is actually small, but you will be able to shred for years in the traditional household with this supply of bags."
3,Check with seller to make sure product is compatible with your system,"Good practical product. Light is bright. If you have an adjustable height hoop system, this product is not compatible with backoard systems that are equipped with a quick release adjustable height mechanism as there is no place to attach the pole.I found this out after assembly. Should work very well with non adjusting systems and has hardware for round or square poles."
4,Would recommend!,I researched speakers for an iPod exhaustively. I am pleased that I purchased this one. The sound is high quality and powerful with little distortion in the bass at high volumes. I love the rechargable battery feature. Just plug it in to charge and off you go. It even acts as a charger for the iPod! I love the compartments for the iPod and earbuds.My only con about this product is that I never could get my iPod nano to fit in the adapter. I use it without it and it works fine.
4,Great speakers,"These are great speakers. They sound good and are very portable and durable. My only complaint is that there is no place inside the unit to store / carry the charger. But I can live with that; just charge it up the night before, and you are good to go."
5,Couldn't Be More Pleased,You won't believe such great sound is coming from this small unit! The rechargeable battery allows you to use it anywhere without worrying about a place to plug it in. It has storage for the iPod and your earphones and a handy little remote. And you can just zip it up and go. I bought three more for the grandchildren.
2,works great....for a while,"I loved this product at first, a flawless and easy portable set up. But after about 6 months it totally falls apart and the place where the ipod connects moves and it is very hard for it to stand up...and also GREATLY effects the sound. AFTER 6 MONTHS IT IS TOTALLY WORTHLESS EVEN AFTER GOOD CARE. Now it actually doesnt even charge...idk wtf is with that. after battling with keeping the ipod upright to play it (putting pieces of paper behind it to keep it proped up), not it just WILL NOT CHARGE ITSELF OR THE IPOD. JUNK!"
5,Good Sound,One of my co-workers had this product and I loved the sound and the portability. Since then 2 others who have seen this product have also purchased it and we all love it.
1,Broke within one month no help from Sonic,I do not recommend buying from any company that does not honor their guarantee/warranty. Mine broke within one month and Sonic never offered to replace or repair.Now they do not even reply to my emails. BTW it worked fine until it broke.
1,the author has no business in teaching,"while this book covers alot of interesting topics, it is written as if it was code documentation. It is pointing out the obvious but not explaining true reasons behind the provided solutions.also, the code examples are full of ridiculous mistakes in every chapter. wish i could return it. (or sell it for fraction of cost)"
5,The Prince of Salsa,The best voice of Puerto Rico today. I can listen to him all day. Do yourself a favor and buy all of Marc Anthony's albums now.
4,A terrific read!,"Don't let the thought of a book involving the Kabbalah intimidate you or turn you away. This is a fast-moving, entertaining novel sprinkled with humor. Don't start it late at night unless you don't have to go to work the next day because once you get into it, you'll read to the end."
2,Poor Categorisation,"Hi,This product did not mention about the non stick interior surface. It just said Hard Anodised. This product when delivered to our house did not have the original Calphalon packaging. It was packed in a white box with one shabby Calphalon booklet inside . It was hard to tell if the product was new or used.All n all, a bad buy."
4,Excellent Game,"I had to write this review because someone rated this very low due to difficulty. The game is fun,hilarious and yes, challenging.But I am not a hardcore gamer and i beat the game, so its not that hard that it should be rated less than 4 stars.If you happen to have a dreamcast and can get a hold of this game, i consider it a must have. You will not be disappointed, even if you are not a hardcore gamer its lots of fun.If you are a hardcore gamer its a definite Five Star Rating"
1,Why is this book still in print?,"I read the English version back in the 70s and so respected & trusted Rev. Wilkerson that I was afraid to invest for years because I thought an economic collapse was surely coming at any time. My challenge to David Wilkerson is to come clean with this stuff and either update it or admit that he missed it. All Christians make mistakes (it's OK to be wrong - just another thing that is covered by the blood of Jesus). This review is not a personal attack on this brother. I have tremendous respect for him and the work he did with Nicky Cruz, gangs and Teen Challenge. Until this book is updated or clarified, I can't recommend it. (P.S. Readers might also be interested in my review of Wilkerson's book, America's Last Call)."
4,Comfortable underwire,"The underwire does separate, and support. There is gonna be some movement. I don't think a woman is ever gonna get away from that without physically affected her breast in the negative. I do have to practice at hooking it on from the back, but other than that minor detail, I am satisfied with its performance. [Would love it if it had a zipper in the front! just saying] Shoulder straps are comfortable, and material is breathable. I jog in FL, and I don't really think about how sweaty my bra gets while I'm wearing this. After doing extensive web research on Sports Bras for D cup, this one turned out to be better than I thought it would. I bought this bra after returning CW-X Women's Ultra Support Running Bra for lack of separation/support."
2,Maybe better for the well-endowed,"Based upon other reviews I ordered a larger cup size - huge mistake. It is baggy, which doesn't do much for support. I am a nursing mother, and need the extra support when exercising, especially when it is getting closer to feeding time, and this is even baggy then! I wish I had ordered my regular size and had not paid attention to the cautions by other reviewers."
2,Way too big,"I ordered my regular bra size, and the fit in the band at the tightest setting was way too loose which means the bra offers no support whatsoever. If it fit, seems like it might be pretty good, but I don't really know. I got a nearly perfect and very supportive fit with another bra I'd ordered at the same time, the Champion Shape Scoop Sport Underwire, in one band size down from my regular size (that was all they had but worked out well) and usual cup size."
5,Sports Bra,This is a great sports bra. Comfortable from the moment you put it on until you take it off. Recommend
4,This Champion is a champion!,"I have been wearing the same sports bra for over 5 years because I loved it so much. I was wearing the moving comfort maia. I was seaching for another one to replace one that finally ""gave out"" when I came across the Champion Powerback. I read the reviews and decided to try it out. I ordered a 34DD and it fits perfectly. I agree with the reviews that it is a little tricky to get on and off. It isn't as difficult as I expected from reading some of the reviews. I run for about 30 minutes to an hour and this bra has great motion control. Feels snug enough to keep things in place but doesn't give that uniboob look.The only thing that feels a little uncomfortable are the staps. It is a razor back style and I'm not used to that. Once I loosened the staps that helped. I am afraid that longer runs may cause chafing but that hasn't been the case so far.For the money I am very happy with the purchase and I'm considering ordering a second."
3,Need to be an contortionist to wear this good bra,"Although this bra is very well constructed, and supports me completely no matter what my activity, I still must mention the fact that you CAN'T undo the bra in back and take it off. You can undo the hook and eye closures, but the bra is designed to be completely sewn together even across the back. Unhooking it simply gives you about 1/2 inch more room at the bottom edge to work with. Great bra, but be ready to struggle."
2,Struggle,I definitely like the motion control of this bra! The downside is it is very difficult to put on...it's almost don't worth using :(.
2,I'm not impressed....,"I am a 42DD and I must say that this is like an average bra for me.You can't tell as much on the model in the picture but the under wire that comes up in the middle is more than likely just there for design cause it doesn't even separate my boobs sufficiently. It has no function. It doesn't even hold my chest. It does give you a nice ""boob silhouette"" under a shirt though. I am going to go and shop for another bra however."
1,Impossible to get on bra,For years I have worn a Moving Comfort 34D. I thought this might show more of a figure. This bra has elastic in the back that does not stretch. If you have shoulders that are wider that the middle of your back this bra is not for you! I did contortions to get it on and nearly had to cut it to get it off.
3,Good support,Good support but not the most comfortable bra. The edges are stiff around the under arm and the overall fabric has no give. It compresses pretty well but doesn't give your breasts very good shape. This bra is definitely all function.
5,Great for high-motion activities,"I usually don't buy bras online, but I had been looking for a really good sports bra for when I horseback ride, and came upon this one. I loved that it had underwire (no uni-boob!), and that you could adjust the band. The first time I rode in this bra, I was amazed at how I wasn't thinking about my chest, and could focus on my riding! Finally, a bra that truly controls motion and offers support for those with larger chests.I see a few people have complained about sizing, not being able to get it on/off easily. I suggest you measure yourself CORRECTLY prior to ordering (a quick google search can tell you how to do it). I found that this bra fit very true-to-size with my measurements, and I got the same size I wear in regular bras. Yes, it fits tight, and I wouldn't want to wear it all day (it is a sports bra, after all) but for a few hours of exercise, it is superb."
1,This bra sucks,"I ordered an underwire sports bra and expected a lot of support from it since other reviewers said this was a great product. It is now in the pile of bras that I use to sleep in. It is not fit to jog in unless I want my breasts flopping all over the place. Save your money and buy the cheap Hanes version, that's what this compares to."
5,Best sport bra ever,"Pros: very good support, true size fit, very good quality, i use it especially when running and lifting weightsCons: not really a con, but it's kind of weird to put it on and to take it off since it doesn't completely open in the back. But the pros make it an awesome bra"
3,Pretty Pop Gems,"Interspersed with some toy piano tinkling that will probably get on your nerves. Three very, very good songs, less than a half hour long, not worth the full purchase price. I'd grab something by Neutral Milk Hotel, or the Olivia Tremor Control if you can afford it before you get this."
4,HD DVD and Blue Ray picutre is identical,"First of all, both the Blue Ray and HD DVD presentation of this film look identical. Why people have to write flat out lies in their reviews because they prefer one format over another is beyond me.Secondly, this is a great movie and while the HD version is an upgrade over previous versions it is far from perfect and shows it's age with grain and some flat colors.So, while I recommend this it is with caution that it isn't quite where it needs to be yet."
1,technical problems on this disc,"5 STARS! It's a masterpiece. Unfortunately, the technical problems on this disc are severe and you will be distracted by the defective video track. AFAIK Manga has not released a replacement disc yet. Don't ruin one of the best animes ever, wait for the perfect version."
3,where is the japanese laguage version?,"I bought this movie on VHS many years ago when Manga released it. It is still one of my favorite animes. I wanted to get it on DVD but sadly I was disappointed. Where is the original Japanese language (english subtitled) version? Everywhere I go online, the DVD version is all English dubbed. I guess I can always send my video tape out for someone to copy to copy to DVD for me. :("
4,My grandfather's name is in te book!,"I will buy the book simply because my grandfather's name, Kidnorked Cinsoete, is in the book."
4,Gets the Job Done,"Criticism of this book is tempered by keeping one important fact in mind; I found all that I needed to begin developing and customizing WorldSoftware applications without the need for formal J.D. Edwards education. So, the author did a thorough job while sometimes wasting words on overblown praise for the product, overemphasizing the value of the report writers, and repeating his confusing practice of picking topics up in the middle, only to provide the necessary information later. I don't have a similar book to compare it to but I must admit that this one is all that I have needed thus far."
3,For Technical Admins only,"I bought this book when I started working with World. It is mostly oriented towards how to manage the customization of JDE code, from admin perspective. If you are creating Dreamwriters, buy this book. It is OK for information on menus and setup, but that is maybe 1/10 the book. If you are looking to understand how the JDE application works, you are out of luck, this is pure tech, no functional JDE at all."
4,TRACK LISTING:,1. No More Mr. Nice Guy2. Breakpoint3. Go to Hell4. Angry Again5. 99 Ways to Die6. Paranoid7. Diadems8. Problems
2,Decent diversion,"This album is best suited for die-hard Megadeth fans. Frankly, I hate some of these songs. A remake of Alice Cooper? No thank you. But I like the remake of ""Paranoid."" Nothing close to Ozzy et al's classic, but good. My favorite song on the album is undoubtedly ""Angry Again."" Too much of this stuff sounds cartoonish--trying to be scary but not pulling it off. Save your money for the regular-length albums."
3,Not to bad.,"This is actually a pretty interesting collection of rarities from Megadeth. I would recommend this album to all fans of Megadeth. So maybe ""No More Mr. Nice Guy"" and ""Paranoid"" turn out to be uninteresting to say the least. ""Breakpoint"" and ""Go To Hell"" sound like they would fit comfortably on 1990's ""Countdown to Extinction"". ""Angry Again"" and ""99 Ways to Die"" reside originally from movie soundtracks. (don't let that scare you away, they are really good songs) This turns out to be a decent little sideshow for a Megadeth fan, even if it is not very essential."
5,absolutely stunning!,"This is one of the great American recordings. I resisted buying it for some time because of its early recording date under the assumption that the sound would be poor. Not So! It is well remastered and, while not state-of-the-art the sound is OK. The music is simply the best acappella music I have ever heard and I have listened to an awful lot of it. If you like this kind of music, this is a must hear."
1,not happy at all,not how is was describe.....not happy at all. i would like my money back.... it comes curly not stright.... and it does not state that....
2,not enough info,looked very good but without the volume of each bowl its impossible to tell exactly how big the bowls in this set are I wanted to buy but after searching all over the internet to get their volume (like most mixing bowl sets give) i decided to skip this for lack of information.
3,not the Leonard I expected,"I picked this book up expecting the fast-paced action, cutting edge dialogue and quirky cons of my favorite Leonard bks. Obviously I was disappointed. The plot did not catch me as his usually do. It really wasnt a bad bk, but the time period eliminated the racy dialogue and morally deficit characters ive grown accustomed to. Mr. Leonard, please come back to the 20th(21st) century!"
2,"a good, but misplaced western","CUBA LIBRE was my first Elmore Leonard. I enjoyed his understated, action-packed prose. I could see he had researched the Spanish Peninsulares, usually absent from most histories and novels. But Leonard included not a single Cuban mambi or officer as a character. And the war was nothing more than a distant disturbance to his rather predictable plot. In the last chapter, Leonard has a reporter ""tell"" the battles of Las Guasimas, El Caney and San Juan Hill to the disinterested antagonist. I am an avid reader of Robert Stone and Tim O'Brien who place their characters in a larger context without sacrificing character or plot. I must also admit that I have been researching and writing a novel about the ""Spanish-Cuban-American War,"" for the past ten years. ""SANTIAGO RAG"" will be published June 22, the anniversary of the American landing at Daiquiri. Look for it on Amazon.com."
2,"A disappointingly bland rendition without the Leonard ""feel""","Mr Leonard has never had to rely on historic events to set up a wonderful mix of characters and incredible circumstances for his stories. I feel that this work was more an effort of his staffers than of himself. This book was as flat as those ""James Bond 007's"" which Ian Flemming did not write. My wait for a new EL continues"
3,Entertaining in Spurts and Unsatisfying in the End,"I'm not a huge fan of Mr. Leonard's work, but I like a good historical novel and a good crime novel, so I gave this a whirl. While many of the supporting characters are fairly interesting, the main characters don't quite escpae from their penny dreadful roots. The middle of the book, where the plot solidifies and the history and politics are stripped away to reveal a more larcenous heart, is very good, but it leads to a rushed and unsatisfying conclusion where the Spanish-American War oddly becomes only a footnote after many pages of build-up. If you're expecting any real people to show up, try elsewhere.This makes perfectly acceptable beach reading, but if you want a crime novel with bite, I'd recommend something by Donald Westlake/Richard Stark instead."
2,A major disappointment,"Having read some of Leonard's crime novels (Riding the Rap, Out of Sight) I was immediatly interested when I saw his new book Cuba Libre in the bookstores. Admittedly I was a little put off by the fact that it takes place a hundred years ago but having read the forementioned book I thought it wouldn't matter. Maybe it did, and maybe it didn't. But the fact is that it never clicked quite the way some of his earlier books did. This is the first book by Elmore Leonard that I didn't like, and ended up like so many books I have started reading, on the shelf partially unread."
5,MAC tricks!,"I have had a PC for about 12 years. I recently purchased a MAC, which I now love. At first I s ready to send it back bacause it was almost like starting over. After I purchased the Missing Manual it helped me fall in love with my new MAC.ThanksMichael"
3,Tedious.,"I have seen so much hype about the Pogue ""Missing Manual"" books that I had to try this one having just switched to the mac after being a long time PC user. This book helped me in some ways but was tediously written. I don't like the author's writing style and some of the contents were irrelevant to me. I would try another book if one were available.. Writing a 500 page book on how to use a computer for a person already able to operate a PC seems like overkill to me. I read about half of it while awaiting being called for jury duty but by the second half had to skim it. It is more like a boring textbook than a primer and transition book. I wouldn't recommend it to the average reader making "" the switch""."
1,Worst software made,"This software will not load properly no matter how you try. The online help is no help at all it gives you a few suggestions that all boil down to please try to re-install. Their down loadable wizard informed me after using it that I needed buy the components that didn't load but were on the disk. Try and remove the parts that do actually load and they do not uninstall properly. McAfee has a section devoted to removal of their software but so far all the suggestions have not worked. Need customer service and its $2.99 per minute from you're first call. I have never had such a horrid experience with a software from a ""reputable"" company in a long time. I will never buy McAfee products again."
5,My Acting Bible,"The Business of Show Business is THE best resource for anyone interesting in getting into the biz. Cynthia Brian spells it all out so you can understand everything. This business can be tricky, but with this book as your guide, your goals will be finally within your reach!"
2,not for Vista,"The web cam looks nice, but it does not work with Vista which is what I have, so here it sits."
3,Great background congas but...,"I was a little dissapointed with the contents of this cd. The background congas are great but I expected more conga solos. Tracks 1,4,5,6 & 7 are more of what I expected music wise. But the other tracks are not what I buy music from a latin percu ssionist for. When I buy a Carlos Santana cd I expect to hear a lot of great guitar. So when I buy a cd from one of the best conga players I want congas and percussion and lots of it. I would like to hear a cd of Mr. Hidalgo with an all out latin band, playing nothing but hardcore salsa."
1,"Short on content, includes stuff that doesn't work","This is a short book on codes with some devices to be used for study. I thought it would be good for my 10 year old nephew. There is a set of code keys with lights and wire to allow morse signaling from room to room; these items could not work as assembled, battery requirements were listed as 2 AAA, the unit needs 4 AA, and it needed to be rewired since the interconnecting wire dropped too much voltage to signal the other key. I also needed to replace lamps (one was bad) with 3 volt lamps. There is obviously NO quality control even at the design stage. The text is too thin to be of any use. Overall, very dissapointing. If you bought this item, email me for instructions on making it usable."
5,My kids enjoyed this in elementary school!,"This ""book"" is really a box with a booklet and many accessories! Includes Semaphore flags, to send codes from a distance. Jefferson Wheels, to encode your messages. Morse Code units. Braille stickers with raised bumps. My son was seriously into codes and did every activity in the book. My daughter had less interest but still danced around ""telling"" us things with her semaphore flags. We got this for my niece as well. Fun and educational!"
3,Is this really Freedent?,"Is this really Freedent? I don't know, it sticks to my dental work, leaves a blue syrup-y liquid behind that gathers and dries at the corners of my mouth and creates cracks, like it dried it out or something.When I used to buy this in the grocery store it never did any of that to me! What's up, Wrigley? Plus, I only ordered one, not two of these."
4,It was a good product while I used it,My new car didn't have the cassette player so I really don't use it anymore. It never got static like my FM tuner one does. Perfect to listen to the ipod in the old beater car though...
1,the tape has completely broken design,"don't buy the tape. the wheels inside are constructed such that they turn in the opposite direction. it might be that in a player that doesn't care about it, the sound is transmitted correctly via the magnetic head, however my car tape player immediately realizes that there is something wrong with the tape, first thinks it's the end of the tape, and after reversing the direction twice displays Tape Error and rejects the tape. the problem is not with my player, but with the tape. this cheap Chinese crap is simply constructed totally incorrectly."
3,It is a Sasha album....but barely,"Before I explain, let me say that I am a huge fan of Sasha. Airdrawndagger and Involver are two very sweet albums, and I still can't get enough of the Ibiza GU album. Having said that, Fundacion doesn't have the cohesive glue that bonds the tracks on the rest of the album. Sasha strings together similar tracks overloaded with female vocals in a jumble that asks your finger to hit the fast forward button. The latter 1/3 of the album simply annoyed me, and I'm really hoping the next Sasha album has a little more to offer."
3,"expected better, still worth hearing","Sasha's latest effort leaves something to be desired. Having said that, its still a good listen if you like Sasha's music, and it does grow on you after a few hearings. However, it seems like sasha has lost something to do with his amazing ability to create soulful music; that is, he is too caught up in his new mixing technology and forgot what a really good song is. It's still good, although disapointing. Reccomended for hardcore fans only."
2,Review of last Beverly Hills Cop movie,"Murphy returns as Axel Foley, yet again, in the third installment of the popular series. As often the case by the third movie, this series has lost pretty much all its steam. Foley is no longer that funny, (in fact, at times, he is uncharacteristicly angry), major players like John Ashton, Ronny Cox, and Paul Reiser are gone, and that cool feel to Foley's presence is all but gone.This time, Axel's boss in Detriot bites the bullet meaning no silly excuse for leaving town or crazy schemes to cover up the fact that he's gone. Hell, he doesn't even use some clever idea to get into the park for free like he did before, he just whines about ticket prices and comes back to pay. Terrible. This character just isn't the same as he once was.There are a few fun moments here and there but Beverly Hills Cop III. is definetly the very least of the series."
3,Does anything good ever happen in Everwood?,"Good story plot in first season concerning Colin, a boy that the doctor literally brings back to life from a coma. ALL is not well for Colin as he struggles to make a new identity for himself and later gets sick again. My problem with the show is everything goes wrong for everybody. Hardly any happy things occur. The preacher and wife get divorced then he goes blind... It got depressing after awhile for me. The relationship between Gregory Smith and Emily Van Kemp keeps you interested, but from other season reviews, I have seen it gets very complicated after he has a fling with the babysitter and she gets pregnant but he does not find out till she has had the baby adopted with a confidential clause that he can't see it."
5,Everwood,"Good entertainment. Gentle characters that reflect a simple way of dealing with the events of life. Not realistic in terms of the real world but easy to accept. Maybe the acceptance is based on our own perspectives on how we wish the world was????Never the less the show is entertaining, acting is very good. Characters are easy to like, no matter how crumpy or querky. I wish all kids where so highly intelligent and understanding of adult failings but...... Here again part of the charm of the show. Reminds me a little bit of Northern Exposure. Not sure why.You won't be disappointed unless you need your entertainment complexed and intense."
5,Everwood,"I love this show, It is such a sham to see it go. I really hope they bring out the rest of the DVD's i would really like to own them all.Even if you have never seen this show. I would recamend it. It's that good. You will want to watch it over and over."
5,Favorite show ever,"I'm so happy to have found this series on DVD, and eagerly await the continual release of seasons on DVD."
5,Everwood - great set!,This is a fabulous set for any Everwood lover! The price is extremely reasonable and there are hours and hours of entertainment!
5,Why Was This Show Cancelled???,"Just got the first season yesterday. I watched through a few of the first episodes, skimming through the chapters. It looks great. Why would it have been cancelled by the WB network so quickly, after just 4 seasons?"
3,"Amazing show, terrible packing.","Okay. I'm rating this as a product that is being sold, not the television show. I have zero qualms with the show. I love the character development, the plot, the scenery, and the writing. What annoys me to no end is how the DVD case is put together. The case has 3 plastic ""pages"" that bend as if you were flipping through the book, with one disc on each side, totaling 6 discs. The problem is that these ""pages"" of heavy plastic are only attached by a single strip is super cheap glue. After flipping through them once, they all fell out of the case and the overall presentation is ruined as a result.Of course, this has nothing to do with the playability of the TV show, but it is something that is just put together very cheaply. I would have paid another 5 bucks or so to have a stronger case, because I'd prefer to not have it fall apart the next time I go to watch it."
2,Yuck,"Totally not for me. It may be becasue every track sounds alike, and that they sound like every other band out there, but this is definitely an album you can skip over and not miss anything."
5,Incredible!,"This CD could be Doc's best work ever. The combination of his incredible skills and the amount of music packed in this CD attest to Good Medicine's greatness! Good Medicine has every kind of music there is- from fast to slow, jazz to classical. If you are looking for a Doc Sevreinsen CD, this one is a must-buy!"
1,not that great,"Put this up against a wall to muffle sound but not effective. Material is not dense, more like packing styrofoam."
5,The little camera that could.,I was skeptical about the size of this camera. When it came in I was very impressed with its capabilities. Color is very rich and lifelike. Low light is adequate. The feel in the hand is quite comfortable. It feels natural and is easy to keep still. Top loading is the way all camcorders should be. Still photography is a definite plus for this camcorder. Normally I just use my digital camera. What I like best about the still photo capabilities of this camcorder is the burst mode. It can take 10 pictures in about 3.5 seconds. Love it and recommend it highly.
3,Info on Japanese military forces WW II,I was a bit disapointed with this book conpared with the German forces book by the same author. The German book had more information where as the Japanese had less.
2,Not for the Beginner,This book is overpriced and of poor quality. The paper and printing are well below current standards even though it was published in 2000. I really wasted my money on this. I did find his ranting about society in general somewhat interesting. Seems people complained about the same things in 1934 that they do now: Society is in a mess and the media is mainly at fault for this. What is the cure for all these ills? The Pilates Method.If you are looking to get started with Pilates excercises don't buy this book. You can buy two or three of the others for the same price.
4,Where it all started,"I am a Pilates instructor so I found the book immensely helpful in understanding the origins of the Method. I would, however, only recommend this book for an instructor or a serious student of Pilates as it is not an easy read. If someone is looking for a glossy, modern guide to Pilates, this is not the book. It amazed me that so many of the techniques he advocated so many years ago are so effective today. Both the vintage pictures and the text fascinated me! Again, this is an excellent book for people who really want to know and understand pure, unadultered Pilates."
5,Love them!!,I use them for make ahead freezer meals. Straight from the freezer to the oven and microwaveable too! Last a really long time. I have some that are 8 years old. Much better than foil containers.
2,Not a Torchwood or Sanctuary,"I agree with a previous review... I can't make myself watch more than 3 episodes. The female lead is grating & anxiety ridden. Her waify looks, & bee stung lips also contribute to an unbelieveable & annoying character!The other main characters are somewhat amusing. But this show falls way short of Brit TV's 5 STAR shows such as Sancuary & Torchwood. For whit, humor, fab plots, suspense, & sexiness check out those shows instead."
1,Lame,"Wow, I love scifi but this show sucks, I thought it would be like sliders meets x-files or something good, but its more like crap meets dead cat, DOnt' Waste your time wacthing this crappy show"
3,This is for the 1G shuffle only,"The minute I opened it, I realized that it was too big for my 2G. Returned it and the vendor was extremely courteous and refunded with no problems."
1,Visibility goes a long way,I wish he could have included a picture and maybe a list from table of contents. It is very hard to buy a used product like this sight unseen.
4,Contac made,"Product arrived without any problems was exactly as described. Aside from the basic issue with all product of this type, hard to apply perfectly without bubbles, it looks great. Much nicer design than the older wood patterns. While its no substitute for real wood it worked fine for replacing a damaged area on a Masonite back of a bookshelf."
2,Slightly disappointed,"Isn't as nice of a 'frost' appearance as I had hoped. Its actually a bizarre design, not the smooth even frost of the professionally frosted windows."
2,Waste of money,"If you don't care if you can see through this just fine, then it's ok. I wanted it to actually keep stuff from showing through, which it didn't."
5,Color did not match,I purchased this contact paper to use under my cabinets to hide wire but the color was not a match.
4,Sonia's second effort is ok,"Sonia's second effort is much better than her first one. You will find no Stock/Aitken/Waterman productions here, but more classic songs like ""You to me are everything"". She proves to have a voice and shows that she can be a serious singer. It's an ok buy, so don't be fooled if you know her from her early fame - Sonia can do much more than SAW dance tracks"
3,"Focused for the potential breeder, not pet bird owner.",Well written. Very little on conure behaviors and info to help me understand and relate to my bird. Alot of detail on avaries and breeding. Reads well. More color pictures would enhance this book.
2,Reads like Stereo Instructions,"I bought this book for a college course in Education on preventing academic problems in the classroom. I had to read each paragraph at least three times in order to understand what the author was trying to state about the students, instructors, or content.This is not a good book for someone who is unfamiliar with the content as it only frustrates by giving choppy information, unclear definitions, and incomplete thoughts. Even as an Education major, I could not comprehend why this book was assigned.The copy I received was published in 1976 and it appears in desperate need up an update as it has lost touch with its students' needs. The information itself may still be relevant, by the format in which it is presented falls short of any desire."
3,"Great design, except for the zipper","I bought one of these 10 years ago. It works great, and I like that the harness attaches to the bike, and the bag detaches from the harness.Unfortunately, the zipper is not heavy-duty and failed after 5 years. If I carry anything of moderate weight like a 5-lb notebook computer or two cartons of milk the strain on the zipper can be too much, even if I use the straps. The zipper on mine has failed."
2,An Enjoyable Read,This is one of the first books I have read about Crystal healings and I hope they all aren't like this. The information on about the healing properties of the crystals is acurate. I found a lot of her other information odd. Such as when she states that a type of crystal is made in secret labritories by higher beings and then placed inside mineral mines. Very interesting thought but not very believable. I don't know why our earth as beautiful as she is can't make her own powerful light sorces with out labritories full of higher beings to do that for her.
1,This was the worst movie that i have ever seen!,I have just seen the worst movie that I have ever seen and probably will ever see in my entire life! Was Ed Wood mental?
1,Be Afraid. Be Very Afraid.,"Although my own sense of humor is warped enough to enjoy a good laugh at Ed Wood's expense, even I can't manage much enthusiasm for this incredibly bad movie-- worse by far than Plan 9 From Outer Space or any other Ed Wood concoction, and that's saying plenty right there. Worse than embarassing, the film is intensely boring, and it's brief running time seems longer than screenings of Gone With The Wind, Lawrence of Arabia, and Around the World in 80 Days played back to back."
5,"If you love Ed Wood,this box set is for you.","These three film were in the top 100's,worst film of all time.I personaly did not know who Ed Wood was,Until I saw Tim Burton's movie version.Ever since, I wanted to know more about Ed Wood.I just recently purchase the box set and,let me tell you ""It was great"".In some cases you get to see some of the mistakes in these films.All kidding aside these movies are classic.I highly recommend these films.His lust for angora,It's not even the half of it.Ed wood rules!"
2,Worst Movie Ever Made,"In my opinion, this is the worst movie ever made. Plan 9 From Outer Space is like Lawrence Of Arabia compared to Glen or Glenda. I gave it 2 stars because Bela Lugosi's parts are funny. Starts with Bela in a laboratory making some ridiculous Ed Wood speech containing classic quotes as ""MAN IS WRONG BECAUSE HE DOES RIGHT. RIGHT BECAUSE HE DOES WRONG! PULL DA STRINGS!"" Then the film is all over the place with stock footage, Wood dressed in women clothes, etc. Some whiney voice saying ""If the creator wanted us to fly, he'd given us wings."" I don't get this movie. I think it might be Ed Wood trying to describe his subconscious on film? I dunno. If you can get through all 70 minutes of this you can get through anything. And those stupid newspaper headlines. There is nothing like this movie. Worth watching once."
3,Step away from the DVD and read the book,"Colin Ferrell is wonderful. Robin Wright Penn is wonderful. The screenplay by Michael Cunningham is ripped from the pages of his novel leaving behind its true heart and soul. How I would like to see this film done again, with the same cast, with a more faithful adaption of the book. Buy the book and read!"
3,"I didn't understand, but the players were cute","We watched this movie hoping it would clarify its story at some point. The actors are cute, so we watched for the scenery, even though we didn't get the story."
2,hit the delete,"I was suckered into watching this horrible film because on the DVD cover Roger Ebert described it as ""one of the best films of the year."" I could not disagree more; after watching it I was still searching for ""a plot at the end of the film."" What plot there is I found entirely unbelievable. Bobby Powell grew up smoking pot, which he introduces to his high school friend Jonathan, and to Jonathan's mother Alice. He also shared sex with Jonathan and an erotic flirtation with Alice. When Jonathan and Bobby meet years later as adults, Bobby fathers a child with Clare, Jonathan's live-in friend with purple hair. Bobby claims, ""I just want everyone to be happy."" The ""family"" of four moves to Woodstock where they open a cafe. But did we not learn from that generation, if not from our HIV generation, that so-called free love, sex and drugs are very expensive? Only in a Hollywood movie could such a bizarre picture be portrayed as idyllic."
2,OMG Colin is too much a hottie to portray him gay,"This movie had potential but come on don't make Colin Farrell gay. I liked the senstive side but the kissing and fondling as an adult was a bit much. If you are a huge Colin Farrel fan don't watch this one. The movie would have been better if the friend was gay and Colin wasn't and the ending what a rip off, the girl leaves with the kid and doesn't come back. This wasn't one of the better Farrell moives."
2,"I don't have all day to ""exercise my baby""","As an occupational therepist, I understand the value in developmental exercises for my baby, but this video has you sitting on the floor doing exercises on your baby all day. I really like the Ivy League Baby DVD by Aimee Ketchum. She is also an OT and gives great techniques to stimulate your baby that you can integrate into your daily routine. She teaches a very simple baby massage as well. I think you can get it on ebay and it is much less expensive."
4,Classic,Love that classic Adidas style. The price is right where it should be in my opinion. Give it 2 to 3 days to break them in.
5,I can't wait for this CD to come out,"I can't wait for this CD to come out. Trina & Tamara are great singers. There the perfect group. I love ""What'd You Come Here For"" & ""Lay You Down"" which are out right now. I know this is going to be a great CD. If you don't already know, Trina & Tamara are twins and they're also Jesse Powell's sisters."
5,An absolutely wonderful book,"This book is told from the point of view of many different narrators, all of whom have some connection with Dvorak and his American sojourn. Some chapters are virtual novellas, others are just funny stories. As ever, Skvorecky's range is prodigious. He can speak with the voice of Czechs and Americans, men and women, blacks and whites, the old and the young. Dvorak himself is glimpsed only from the outside, by those around him, and it is not necessary to know more about him than that he was a great musician in order to enjoy -- and be moved by -- this comic novel.If the Nobel Prize committee made decisions based on a writer's skill and range and mastery of literary form, Skvorecky would have won years ago. He's without doubt the funniest great writer alive. If you haven't read him yet, you have a treat awaiting you."
5,Gotta Have It,"Anyone who has ""trust"" issues, and you may not even know it, until you begin reading this book, has to have itIt is a complete, step by step, soft, yet direct introduction to cleaning out the garbage of life that weighs you downIt opens the door to a comfortable future without painGreat read"
3,Coming of age novel,I did not find this book to be as good as many other classics I have read. It was an enjoyable read but can't say it was a favorite.
5,Good Product,This is the same brand that I use at my accupunctures. They help relax my muscles. However only the big cups are useful.
3,"Good reference, poor organization","This reference book has lots of information and landscape/nature quotes from many famous authors, but it is poorly organized; by using an alphabetical system, the reader cannot easily find a specific geographic area or description unless the user already knows the term s/he wants to use and merely wants a definition, is the format sensible. The index helps, but having to use it for everything is a pain in the neck."
4,"Good, but I still didn't find what I was looking for","This book has a lot of information in it, but it doesn't have all weeds, I don't think any book could. And I still couldn't find out the information on the weed that I was looking for."
5,"****Great, Underrated album****","So happy to see all the positive reviews here for this disc. [...] From Sweet baby James in '70 thru Flag in '79, there is not one bad disc, but this one is especially appealing. It is very rare for an album to suck you in on the first 2 or 3 tracks and keep you listening to the end, this is one of them!!! Absolutely beautiful from start to finish. My pesonal favorite out of my top five which include One Man Dog, Walking Man, Gorilla, In the Pocket, and JT. Beautiful songs, top notch musicianship and that great early 70's sound, warm, rich, and musical!!If you haven't heard it, buy it!! You won't regret it, superb!!!"
2,Way too small,"The shoes were absolutely gorgeous! The size I ordered was a 10 because I usually wear a 9 1/2, but just by looking at them I knew they were too small. I had friends at work try them on to see if they wanted them, and we figured out that it's actually around a 7 1/2. They're made in Italy, so perhaps 10 is the European size, but that wasn't noted in the online ad."
1,Deceptive selling practices - DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER,"I ordered several HP 110 Tri-Color Inkjet Print Cartridge (CB304AN) ink cartridges. The seller ""OC Inkjet"" shipped remanufactured (read ""refilled"") third party cartridges and listed them as ""HP Compatible"" on the invoice. In addition, it took 9 days from the date of my order for the shipment to arrive and for me to discover this deception so I did not have time to order authentic products from a reputable seller before I needed them. DO NOT order from this deceptive, dishonest, disreputable seller. Be sure you are ordering from Amazon or another seller.UPDATE: After receiving a complaint regarding the substituted product, the seller did fully refund my order and offer an apology."
2,Misleading,I haven't used this ink cartridge yet but I found the ad to be very misleading. The picture shows a genuine HP cartridge but I received an HP compatible cartridge. I would never have ordered this cartridge if I knew it wasn't a genuine HP cartridge. I ordered this through the Amazon site and the seller was OC inkjet.
1,very very very expensive .... per print,For the price of this ink it has cost me about a $1.00 a print for the 4 x 6's. Unless I'm doing something wrong This is Highway robbery. I did try changing preferences but it did not make much of a difference. I love my Hp 626 as far as getting a great printed picture but I just can't believe the cost of the HP 110 cartridge. We just went on a trip and I had a 100 pictures. It took 3.75 cartridges to print all 100.
4,I'm very pleased!,"The front of the case was a little scratched but I didn't mind because the cd was fine. It plays w/ no problems at all. BUT there are still some songs on it that i wish was there but they're on the others, so do I recommend, YES very empowering songs and I love to sing my worship songs. Thank you Amazon. :)"
5,Perfect!,"I'm always a little hesitant purchasing used, but this was a replacement for the same CD that was worn out and could not be purchased in new condition for a reasonable price. If you love Christian praise and worship music, this is the CD. The music is just fabulous."
2,FAIR video quality and POOR sound,"I purchased this video because I thought the sound quality would be decent and that the video quality would be OK. Instead the sound quality is similar to that of a telephone. Ever had someone call you while they are standing next to a steam engine or at a fireworks show and say 'gee doesn't that sound great !"" ?Although not suitable for an adult collection the most expensive ($30) DVD I have ever bought will be warmly welcomed into my 4 year old's collection right next to Thomas."
3,.... Left me with a lot of unanswered questions,"When I first started reading this book, everything was really foggy and a bit complex. The way that the chapters go from Jeremiah to Ellie is unique but, a little confusing at first.I really would have liked to see how Ellie's parents would have reacted to seeing Jeremiah but, the book ends with a twist which in my eyes, was not very well done. I had to read the last 4 chapters again to get what actually happened and when I finally found it out, I was shocked and saddened with a lot of questions in my head... ""Why did it happen?"" ""Who did it?""The big problem is there's a lot of ""flowery"" writing in the book that I feel dosen't get to the point.It's a good reader for teen girls but, I would'nt recommend it for teen males."
1,If You Come Softly,"I decided to read this book for school because my librarian suggested it. However, i found it to be the most boring book i had ever read. There was no climax! So, i wont be found reading any of her books ever again."
5,This book was exceptional!,"I really did enjoy reading this book. I felt Jacqueline Woodson was descriptive with everything she wrote, it was if I was in Ellie or Miah's shoes. It was such a sensitive topic and she explored it at two teenage perspectives without even being negative. She deserves 'props' for that. The end wasn't exactly typical. I don't mean to hint but we'll just say it was tragic. This book for the most part was great, Jacqueline has some potential and I'm glad it didn't go unoticed, she deserves every one of her awards."
2,"Too ""perfect"" for me!","I read this book as a part of my school's ""social justice"" unit and we got to pick our books. Our group picked ""If you come softly,"" and now I wish we hadn't. This book was not exciting and I didn't want to read the assigned pages. We know that people don't like to see a white person and a black person together. The whole book just seems cliche, like how Ellie and Jeremiah meet by ""bumping"" into each other. And then how they ""can't stop thinking about each other."" It bugs me how perfect their relationship is, even with the racial tension. I now know that I don't like love stories, especially this one. Try something more exciting, like Dan Brown or Cornelia Funke."
5,Can't get enough of Cobb!,"I've read every installment of Cobb's ""Amanda Garrett"" series and I find them incredibly fascinating, engaging, and I can't wait to see a movie based on one of these! For the woman who loves combat and/or action genre, his books have all of that AND a fantastic female role model! I believe Sea Strike to be the best so far. Great dialogue -- variety of colorful characters -- and a very realistic, unpredictable plot."
4,Dvd New Zealand,Very picturesque and informative. Hoping to see most of the sites featured in this DVD.
4,Very unique scent,"I had checked out DK Belicious at the mall one time, but never pursued it. At work one day I happened to catch the scent on a co-worker and asked her what she was wearing. (A way in which I have selected several perfumes.) Anyway, she told me what she was wearing and having liked the way it smelled, I ordered it online. I know a bit risky since I had not actually tried it, but I am very happy with it. It is clean, fresh, but not overpowering fruity. A youthful scent, but not college age. I am 51 by the way. A fun spring/summer scent with some grown-up appeal."
4,Not a big Apple perfume fan but i like it!,"I actually like this. Which is surprising because I don't like apples at all,not in perfume or just regular old plain apples. But this is a great. It has the smell of a fresh ,ripe, and crisp green apple. I can't stop using this perfume! I love it!"
1,Stay away from Perfumania,"Product did not reach the final destination. After corelating with Amazon.com, found out that Perfumania sent to wrong address and product was returned to them. I did not recieve a full refund. They called it a ""return"" and docked 20% off the purchase price and didn't refund shipping. How can it be a ""return"" if I never recieved the item in the first place. I might as well have just given them money. This company is horrible and feels no regret for screwing over their customers. Purchase with extreme caution if you choose to do so."
4,4 stars because I like the bottle,"I thought I liked this perfume when I smelled the sample that came in the department store's catalog. I hinted around enough that ""I had to have it!"" and so I got it as a birthday present. Well, let me just say, I don't ware it! It's kind of masculine in my opinion, and also a little soapy, maybe. The truth is, I can't put my finger on exactly why I don't like it.Of course, I love the bottle for its uniqueness! I think it's time I face perfume facts: Just because I like the bottle doesn't mean I will like the scent..."
1,"Horrible, horrible scent!!","I'm puzzled by all the 4 & 5 star reviews. This scent is awful. It's gotta be one of the least masculine fragrances out there. It's way too citrus-y and much too strong. It reminds me of that el-cheapo ""$2 a gallon"" aftershave that little kids buy their dads for Father's Day. It is about as off-putting as a scent can be. I cannot imagine any man choosing this as his 'signature scent'. Bring back DKNY Unleaded ... please!!"
4,Love the smell of this!,"The DKNY Be Delicious line is awesome. I love the smell of it, and just wish it lasted longer then a hour on my skin. I get so many complements, the only downfall is the smell doesn't last long, same with the perfume..."
2,"I Love the Scent & the Bottle Design, But the Scent Just Doesn't Last....","This one seems to have a very fresh & delicious apple scent, but this scent is also 1 of the most short-lived scent that I've ever encountered in my 30+ yrs.(both on my clothes & skin), & so, don't purchase it until U've tested it for yourself...."
5,The wife loves it.,"The wife loves the damn thing. Me personally I think it's ok, I have smelled better fragances."
3,"Unobjective, sometimes scary in conviction","What disappointed me about this book was that it wasn't so much Edgr Cayce on reincarnation as it was Noel Langley on Reincarnation and occasionally Edgar Cayce. His conviction, the need of the author to ""prove"" everything he said made it a little uncomfortable and sometimes boring to read, too. Otehrwise, it's interesting. Lots of good first-hand accounts."
5,Sonata Arctica Gets better with every album,"Every song on this CD is excellent. If you like the other SA cd's you should like this one as well. The chorus's are even more addicting on this release. Standouts for me are Don't Say A Word and White Pearl, Black Oceans, but all the songs are excellent. The album may not hook you as quick as the previous cd's mainly because the songs take longer to develop. But once this album hooks you, your stuck with it. Can't wait till the next album. For me this CD is harder than the others, but this is fine with me. Also the songs are more operatic; some of the songs chorus's remind me of Queen and Blind Gaurdian. Support great music and BUY this cd."
3,Audiovox CCS100,"The Audiovox CCS100 cruise control works flawlessly but the installation is a bit difficult. In particular, Audiovox has not updated the installation instructions for over 7 years. There is no wiring information on vehicals made after 1999, even their web site does not have the information available. I was fortunate to have the wiring diagrams for my car and was able to complete the installation."
4,speed control,"I have used this product before and was well satisfied, this one had a defect and was returned. the technician from the audio-vox was very helpfun and treated me super."
4,Finally got the cruise to work.,I installed this cruise on a 1985 20 ft winnebago LeSharo with a Renault 4 cylinder motor and chassis. I was able to hook up to the VSS which made things a lot easier than using the magnets.wires I did not use.blue wire with noise suppressor (cut short)grey wire inside that comes off 4 pin connectorDIP switch setting we'reall on except 4 and 6found other dip settings did not work above 45 mph.good luck. I am buying another one for our 92 honda civic.jack
5,"Love, love, love, LOVE!!","I can't understand why this Bjork rendition album doesn't have as many reviews as some of the others in this series. This album is truly beautiful, soothing, and masterfully done. I don't even have a child! I'm a 23-year old graduate student, but I've completely fallen in love with this album and series. My favorites are definitely ""Like Someone In Love"", ""Hunter"", ""Joga"", and ""Bachelorette"". Sooooo good. I really wish they had done ""Venus as a Boy""...that would have fit right into this incredible album.I can't gush enough- buy this if you're a Bjork fan, please! You won't regret it!"
5,THIS IS ONE GREAT BOOK!!!,"If you want to see Imagineering in action you've got to get this book! This book is worthy of 6 stars. Don't think about it, get it!!!"
5,A Fun and Great Book.,I love this book. I got it straight from a Disney Imagineer. This a a great source for park info and is great to read before going to the parks.I'll make you seem much smarter than your traveling companions and is a great book for ANY DISNEY FAN. I love this book and it is WONDERFUL.
2,Not what I expected,"I was enthralled with a visit to Ireland over the summer. I wanted to learn more. I didn't investigate this book more before I ordered it. I thought it was more historical. It is actually about legends from prehistory. Mostly like fairy tales, children turned into swans, etc.But, the price was right!"
5,Remarkable book!,"This true story of a family so dedicated to serving the Lord will break your heart and encourage your heart all at the same time. After reading this book, you will think twice about ""sweating the little things"" in life. God is good."
2,Natures Baby,I bought this DVD thinking it would be as entertaining as Baby's Day. NO way! It is very boring and does not keep my five month's attention for very long at all. The music is not fun and upbeat like Baby's Day. I would NOT reccomend going out and buying this DVD.
3,They are Rumpletilskinz,"Rumpletilskinz released just one album 1993's What Is a Rumpletilskin? and disappered from sight not long after. The group had a Leaders Of The New School sound (they appreared on the LOTNS's ""Sound Of The Zeekers"") and the album feautured two minor hits on the rap charts ""Attitudes"" and ""Is It All Right?"". Other standout tracks are ""Theramixx"", ""I-N-I"" and ""Sweet Therapy""."
4,If this doesn't get you into SALSA then there's no hope!,"This is a must for anybody who likes salsa or just starting to explore it. I remember hearing it for the first time in a salsa joint in Paris and I was hooked immediately. Not all songs are equally strong or equally well arranged, but just for the two songs ""A La Hora Que Me Llamen Voy"" and ""Con Sandra En La Came"" (six stars, because they belong to my all-time favorite songs) it is worth buying the CD. As a nice bonus Celia Cruz joins in for the final song after a tribute to her by Jose himself."
4,"What happened to ""widescreen?""","I wish this video would've been widescreen. I do so hate the pan-and-scan, but for this movie it works well. Jim Carrey, you gotta love him for all the effortless feats he performs in this film. As shy banker Stanley Ipkis he is a gem, and even more remarkable when he acquires The Mask. I am a recent fan of his, and have been seeing his movies that I missed. This one is the definitive funny man and the story isn't half bad either. I loved Cuban Pete. Even the neurotic Stanley who visits a popshrink of a book about masks people wear reminded me so much of a typical Carrey action. A must see for all Carrey fans!"
3,AN OK MOVIE,"THIS JIM CARREY FLICK, WHICH WAS ANOTHER BIG HIT FOR JIM CARREY, IS ABOUT A BANKER WHO DISCOVERS A MASK THAT TURNS WHOEVER'S WEARING IT INTO A WACKY SUPERHERO. THE MOVIE'S ALRIGHT. IT DOES HAVE ITS FUNNY MOMENTS. THE SEXY CAMERON DIAZ MADE HER FILM DEBUT IN THIS MOVIE. THIS MOVIE IS GOOD FOR COMEDY FANS. EVEN THOUGH IT COULD'VE BEEN A LITTLE BETTER THAN WHAT IT WAS. FOLLOWED BY A SHORT-LIVED ANIMATED SERIES."
1,The most silly film ever.,"Maybe it is because I don't like Jim Carrey; maybe I don't understand this type of movies; and maybe I am wrong but The Mask proudly becomes the first movie which gets the lowest possible rating. Certainly, there are movies with worse acting that this, but although those movies at least offer something to be entertained by, The Mask fails to deliver in all departments. The film was so silly I couldn't believe anybody had the courage to make it. But I guess my opinion is in sharp contrast with opinions of most people, as I heard my friends saying how great and funny it was and as I see the movie's high rating."
5,Hilariously entertaining and romantic with great DVD extras,No one else but Jim Carrey could have played the title character in The Mask. This movie takes full advantage of his comedic talents. The special effects are great. The story is touching. Cameron Diaz is gorgeous. Milo the dog is a scene stealer. Totally entertaining! The DVD extras include a couple of deleted scenes and a director's commentary that is one of the best accounts of what goes on behind the scenes I've ever heard. This one's a keeper!
4,Carrey classic,"If you haven't seen this movie it, buy it. Carrey rocks and it's even fun for kids! No tacky scenes or bad language. Our 2-1/2 year old really likes it, too."
3,It is just a funny film not a serious movie,This is just a movie to laugh at and have a good time with. And there are so many people who say The Mask is just too harsh and violent and the one that really made me laugh was some say that it is too scary? The best parts of course are when he is wearing the mask. As for the plot it is pretty bad when you look at it but I think everybody knows that. The violence for this movie is funny and even little kids can watch this. For crying out loud they even made a action figure of the mask years ago. The Mask is an original entertaining light comedy.
3,Tough and Dry,"This is just okay pop corn. We use a stove top stainless steel popper with Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil. With Arrowhead Mills Organic pop corn it makes a wonderful, tender, delicious pop corn. With Now Foods, okay but tough and dry."
5,I'm a popcorn lover from childhood and non GMO is the way togo,"I use a StirCrazy popcorn popper that is a fabulous appliance and this popcorn is not only delicious and thoroughly pops, it is not a genetically modified corn. In today's agricultural world that isn't easy to find. My only problem is I live in Costa Rica and to have a friend bring this down in their suitcase is sometimes an issue with Customs. Randomly if they check the suitcase they will disallow this popcorn as an agricultural ""seed"" and that is a no-no. Other times, it gets through no problem. It may become too much an issue for me to risk paying for and customs folks ending up confiscating. With that said, this popcorn is worth the money and risk."
2,Just a notch above terrible,"I am a fairly forgiving reader, but this book was so poorly written that I found myself skimming about the last three-quarters of it. The plot was moderately interesting, but there were large holes, and the conclusion was utterly nonsensical. The only saving grace was the appealing main characters -- who spoke, sadly, in some of the most stilted, un-Regency-like dialogue every written."
1,Don't Bother - Thumbs Down,This film was a poor knock off of the book with inaccurate portrayal of actual events. Maggie was annoying instead of the heroic figure the movie tried to make her seem. John Getz was a sulky drag. Find the book and read it instead. This movie insults the book.
4,Planet Earth... need I say more!,"Jamiroquai is definitly no one hit wonder. With all the success following ""Travelling without Moving"" You'd think that this album would blow, but it's totally opposite! I feel that it is by far his best ablum yet."
2,"Pure disco, people...","Okay, if you like disco, this is the CD for you. It is simply modern disco with a pop twist. If you don't like disco, it's trash. That's all you need to know. Thank you."
1,Very very bad,"If only a zero was possible. Didn't disco die in the seventies? Anyway, no, I didn't buy this awful CD. However, I did work at a record store where I was forced to listen to this ""music"". If you are unsure DO NOT BUY THIS CD. It is so bad that I almost killed myself when I found out that music like this was being made. If you have it ... may you stay ever far from me. Jamiroquai=bad."
3,Disappointing!,"I am a HUGE Jamiroquai fan and was anxiously awaiting the release of their fourth album-Synkronized. I cannot describe how disappointed I was when I heard it. Don't get me wrong, its not entirely bad. It simply isn't as strong as the albums that preceeded it. It seemed that after Space Cowboy and Traveling Without Moving, Jamiroquai was moving toward establishing themselves as the quintessential funk/acid jazz band. For that reason, Synkronized seemed to come from somewhere out in left field. Where the other albums were driving, this one is soft. The others were clearly funk inspired. This one is cheap disco. Its grown on me since I bought it but Im just not used to Jamiroquai having to grow on me-- they usually grab me from the first listen.On another note, I saw them in concert in NYC. The show was AMAZING!!!"
5,A Classic,"I'm a big fan of Jamiroquai and this is by far the best Jamiroquai album to date. They're like wine, they get better as they age. This is a keeper."
4,MUCH better the second time around!,"I rushed out and bought this CD the day it was released. However, I was quickly disappointed. I was expecting the same kind of brilliance that I heard on the previous ""Travelling Without Moving."" I shelved the CD shortly after purchasing it, and even considered selling it. Fast forward to today: I pulled it out and dusted it off. Then I heard the CD with fresh ears, and I think it's great. While I like ""Travelling Without Moving"" and especially Jamiroquai's first CD a lot better, ""Synchronized"" has some great music on it: ""Canned Heat,"" ""Butterfly"" and ""King for a Day"" stand out. I know it's hard to do, but a music lover needs to approach each CD with as much objectivity as possible in order to appreciate its unique qualities. I was able to do that with ""Synchronized"" and I'm so glad!"
4,Another Good CD from Jamiroquai!,"""Synkronized"" is another great CD from the incredible band, Jamiroquai. There's is hardly anything bad I can say about these people. The music is great and Jay Kay's vocals still blow me away. It amazes me how such a big voice could come out of his body!! *laughing*Although my favorite album of Jamiroquai's is still ""Travelling Without Moving,"" ""Synkronized"" is still a wonderful mix of funk music that will get your feet moving, especially ""Canned Heat""!Any of fan of Jamiroquai's should have this CD in their collection!!!"
3,less is more,"I love jamiroquai, and love '70's music. I really like the songs, when I first hear them, but soon they start to get tired and old. Jamiroquai needed more funkiness on this album, and I think they've just retreated by doing this sort of an album. It's very good, but it's not what (I feel) they should have done."
2,A step away,"A bad Jamiroquai album is much better than anything else coming out today...However, this record is a step back from the previous releases. Appart from Canned Heat there's not much funk to it. The instrumentals are OK, but not great. Black Capricorn Day is a bullet in the head to all the ""old"" Jamiro fans...I expected more."
5,Excellent DVD of the real thing,"This DVD is most certainly not for everyone. But if you want to see a corrida, if you want to see incredible talent and bravery from one of Spain's top matadors, this is a great place to start. Through this DVD you get to see not only his talent, but also get to see a bit of the private life of El Fandi. You don't fully appreciate this man's commitment to the corrida until you ""meet"" him outside of the ring. His bravery and this commitment are not fully evident until you see what happens during the summer season of 2005."
4,Good 2.8 Zoom,Great 2.8 zoom for the price.A little soft on the edges at 18.Lightweight and well manufactured.I would recommend this product.
1,"very, very weak","I agree with the one star reviews already posted. I'm a performing musician looking to improve already decent skills and this video was completely useless to me. I can't imagine it would be any more useful to any one with less experience. I was very disappointed in that there were almost no exercises provided and on the whole DVD only ONE musical example!! How can Berklee release an ear training DVD with only ONE MUSICAL EXAMPLE????I could go on and on with other things wrong with this, but there's no need. Just don't bother with this DVD."
5,excellent,"The Diamond II is a very rich and strong coffee. A bit pricey but worth every penny. If you don't want to fork out the money for this, the Gold blend is nearly as good at a much lower price point."
1,Not much flavor - very disapppointed,My wife and I like strong coffee. Even brewing this at twice the recommended amount it tasted weak. There may be subtle tastes and flavors involved but there just was not much coffee taste. The experience is more like drinking tea.The only plus is that there is not any bitterness.
2,Not the Cat's Meow,"I love cats (which is why I bought this book), but the author, unfortunately, seems to have only a passing interest in felines. I sensed little admiration for cats in his writing and, indeed, he seemed to reduce them to mere clinical biological specimens. Some of what he claimed about cats I know personally (from being a cat owner) to be untrue, such as his assertion that ""Following people around is admittedly unsual even among pet cats"" (p. 79). What? Every cat I've had has followed me around; they follow me to bed, follow me from room to room when I clean the house, follow me to the bathroom or kitchen in the middle of the night; one stray used to follow me on a long walk to my mailbox and back (which in large part finally led me to adopt this cat). I'm not sorry that I read this book; I learned much. But the author didn't make learning about cats nearly as entertaining an experience as it could have been had he shown more enthusiasm about the subject matter."
4,good,"I wasent able to find this specific album at any music stores, I was shocked when I looked for it on your web-site and immediately got my results with 4 in stock on top of that. Thanks"
2,Panoramic View Lost in DVD vs. PBS Presentation,"I am very disappointed with the quality of this DVD vs. the PBS presentation. Panoramic views were virtually lost as all four sides of the film are truncated destroying the panoramic effect of depth and distance. Secondly, the music was so loud at times I could barely hear the narration. I did not have that problem either while viewing on public television. I've viewed this DVD on a large HD screen and small HD laptop screen. Both screens confirm that this DVD of Utah's National Parks fails to capture the film's quality ""as aired on public television."""
2,The book is an opportunity lost,"Dana and Ginger Lamb were adventurers, Julie Huffman-Klinkowitz and Jerome Klinkowits are academics. Like blind people describing an elephant ,the authors told us about it's foot. An elephant is more than a foot. The Enchanted Quest of Dana And Ginger Lamb was researched in libraries. There is no indications that the authors ever so much as visited Mexico on a Club Med Tour. The book is an opportunity lost. For those who are hungry for Lamb information the book has value. If one has not read the Lamb books, there is no reason to read"
2,Sounds like it's from Thailand,"I bought two of these Rockaby baby CDs - Bob Marley and the Beatles. The Beatles CD works much better with the kind of format for some reason. The Bob Marley CD sounds a little weird and ""dingy""....a little like wind chimes. It reminds me of music I heard while in Thailand."
1,A special kind of Hell,"I am a music therapist and percussionist, and was given this CD as a baby shower gift as the person knew I really like Bob Marley. I'm afraid to say I think this CD is just awful. The mallet instruments are not actually in tune with each other, and most of the songs are very hard to recognize. Most of all though, I think it is better to simply play Bob Marley to your baby! I don't understand the need for special baby versions of existing music, and look at them as just another unnecessary product. If you are looking for a lullaby kind of CD, you may be interested to check this out, but definitely listen to some sample tracks before buying."
4,Lovely,"These are lovely, whimsical sounding renditions of Bob Marley's greatest hits. My Jamaican husband is not sold on the CD and feels we should just have bought an original Bob Marley CD. But our little one loves this CD and falls asleep to the lullabies!"
4,Great Idea,What a great way to introduce a child to music I like...lullaby versions of Bob Marley. I stopped short of 5 stars because some of the songs are not readily identifiable. But I plan to get the lullaby cd of Jimmy Buffett too.
5,Laughter is Good for the Soul,"I too heard this author speak on a local christian radio station. After reading this book I'm sure this will not be my last book by this author. My favorite part is from the movie ""City Slickers"" when the prophet Bill Crystal says...in your 30's you raise your families, in your 40's you grow a pot belly, in your fifties you have minor surgery, in your sixties the music is too loud, in your 70's you and your wife retire to Ft. Lauderdale,and in your 80's you end up babling to a Jamaican Nursewho you can't understand..... Any questions ?""For a heart warming and humorous look into Mr. Callaway's Life read this book !"
3,healing with angels,"When I firt started reading this book I thought the author was pretty convicing, as I was read on I started to feel that what Dr.Virue was saying was exactly what I wanted to hear. Since she is a phsycologist she know what people what to hear. I my oppinon Dr.Virtue wasn't very convicing.She dosen't give steps for healing with the angels. All she says is that if you ask them to heal you they will, once you know that the book is useless.If you are interested in angels I would suggest reading The Book Of Angels by Francis Melville."
5,Great brush,"Works great. I've used this brush for a few years now and love it. My hair is very thin and sometimes brushes tangle my hair, but the Bio Ionic is smooth and never tangles my hair."
1,Delivery awesome--item was delivered exactly as ordered. A five star from that perspective.,"Ordering item and delivery was exceptional. However I was VERY disappointed with the brush. I have several of the Bio ionic brushes and loved them!! The newer versions are missing the rubber grip on the handle and the new ""super smooth"" handle makes it almost impossible to hold firmly. I had to resort to wrapping the handle with grip tape. Unfortunately due to the change I would not order this product again until they put the rubber grip back on the handle. Very unfortunate as it was an awesome brush and worth every penny:( It is now a complete waste of money"
5,Touch of Truth,This is a great TV movie. As always Patty Duke is outstanding as theteacher. Melissa Gilbert gives a sound performance as the mother.A heart felt movie with great cast.
3,Not for the solo writer,"I've tried twice to use this book and gave up. It's not that the book is bad. It's that to really get any value from it, you need at least a writing partner, if not a writing group. Although the front matter says you can use the book as an individual, in all practical terms you can't. Most of the exercises require someone to role play with, to get ideas from, or to exchange feedback.For someone who wants to run a weekend workshop or retreat, or already has access to a writing partner or group, this book maximizes that dynamic. Solo writers, however, would do better with any of Eric Maisel's other books."
5,Works Great With Studio,This device works great with Pinnacle Studio 14 HD software. A must have for anyone doing video editing on the computer.
1,What a Misconception!,"First off I am not fan of Kevin Costner. Secondly I wonder when people who are not of a culture why they want to seem to be know it all's?...and Third most of the main actors were not even from that culture instead as hollywood loves to do...just give it to someone they think can pass a puerto rican actor and a white/chinese actress from england instead of getting more maori actors it just wasn'tthe same give me a break get some real Maori actors ...They do the same thing with American Indians....I hear because johnny depp is suppose to have Indian blood ties (Oh! Cherokee) he will be playing Tonto in the up coming movie ""Lone Ranger"" I can not wait to GAG! Should have given a ""Real Indian"" Actor a chance to play that part there are alot of good American indian actors...I saw ""When we were Warriors""and to me that was a great film....way better than this.....NDN4LIFE"
2,was not sent in english,I requested this dvd in english & it did not come in english . could not watch it . Did not have sub-titles either.
5,Rapa Nui,"Excellent experience! The movie arrived within days, and was exactally as described. The dvd transfer of this movie was great and it played perfect in my Blu-ray player. Would do business with this seller again for sure."
4,all emotions,"The difference for me between Tongues and Whaler is that I feel closed in with Tongues and free with Whaler. Also Timbre gets me this wonderfull feeling. It makes me feel the wind in my hair, so clear and pure but with all the emotions someone can feel; insecurity, angry, sexy, happy, honesty and relativity..."
1,Tacky,"I ordered this book for my future in-laws and it came plastic spiral bound with what looks like a computer copy of the cover. I've never seen such a tacky looking book. There are no pictures and that is pretty unusual for a travel book, even though it is a reference-type book. It looked more like a high school report than a book. One star was even a higher rating than I wanted to give it. I will be sending it back!"
4,"Quality characters, creative sex, quality erotica.","I found this to be an excellent piece of erotic fiction, with characters that had a surprising depth. This is particularly notable considering that this is a collection of short stories. The sex is creative yet vanilla enough to appeal to most (except the homoerotic squemish).My girlfriend and I greatly enjoyed this book and highly reccomend it."
2,It is good if that is what you are looking for.,"I myself dabble in the penning of erotic fiction and I found that my own ideas on how it should be written in order to arouse were very different to Learner's. I felt I knew far too much about the characters. This did not allow me to be able to place myself in the story. If it is voyerism you are looking for, well this is a great book. However, if you want to be titilated and aroused, to be able to allow yourself to become a part of the action, this is not the book for you. A certain amount of anonymity I feel is necessary if the reader is able to imagine it is indeed themselves in the particular situation. It did concern me that the opening line of the book was ""Sandra and Brian are a middle aged couple."" I almost put the book down. But I battled on and learned some lessons. I wouldn't say this is a book that shouldn't be purchased, but please bear in mind that you may be disappointed if you are seeking something else."
1,Boring,"After about five pages of elementary school level material and repetitive, wordy, boring text that said almost nothing of substance I skipped the first three chapters (because skimming them revealed more of the same). I think some of the later chapters might be more useful but I'm up to chapter 6 and so far have underlined about three pieces of text that might be worth referring back to. The rest is filler."
5,Absolutly Awesome!,This soundtrack is the best. There is a wide variety of music on it for every listener. The songs are wonderful.
5,"5 stars just for ""Can't Hurry Love"", and the rest","The version of ""You Can't Hurry Love"" by the Dixie Chicks on this Sountrack is one of the best covers I have ever heard in my life. I was completely blown away, and had to buy the disc. It's a very good CD from start to end, extremely good for a motion picture soundtrack, which are usually all B-Sides. This album is different. Two thumbs up!"
3,Listen to it before you buy,"Most of the songs on this cd are pretty bland. I thought about buying it just for the two Dixie Chicks songs (which are great- especially ""You Can't Hurry Love"") but after listening to it, I found that the cd as a whole isn't that great."
1,Poor Quality Print,"""A Christmas Memory"" (ABC 1966) and the companion piece ""The Thanksgiving Visitor"" (ABC 1967) were films by Frank and Eleanor Perry. Geraldine Page won an Emmy for each production. The films were shot in Alabama in color and have rarely been seen since the original broadcasts.This version is a very poor quality black and white kinescope . It does not include any special material such as Stage 67 title sequence or commercials, extras which sometime distinguish a kinescope. Excellent color prints were shown on the A&E cable network in 1993. See also ""Truman Capote's Trilogy"" (1969) for a slightly edited version of ""A Christmas Memory"" and the companion book by the Perrys (1969)."
3,Double exposure,"The DVD is fine...it could have had a cover on it presenting name of DVD and cast, etc. But the problem was that I received two copies and was billed twice. Have sent one copy back at my expenses and am waiting for refund."
3,Great Film. Poor Copy.,"My wife and I fondly remembered this made-for-TV movie. Originally filmed with grace and simple beauty, it features outstanding performances. However, the poor quality of the copy from which it was digitized is disappointing. We bought a second copy for friends who had never seen it, but had recently attended a Christmas dinner reading of the story. I'm a little embarrassed by the quality of the gift. There has to be a better copy out there or some kind of restoration which could produce a better copy of this delightful film. Mr. Capote's original narration is wonderful. If this copy were in restored condition or copied off a more pristine original, I would give it five stars."
3,"Good show, poor DVD","This is an excellent adaptation of Capote's short story: basically, nothing added, nothing deleted, all well-written and well-performed. But the DVD is identical to the VHS version: uneven sound, no closed captions. Certainly worth having a copy of this great show, but no good reason to upgrade to the DVD if you already have the VHS version and a player."
1,I found better DVD in COLOR by googling,"I love this wonderful Christmas story and we have tried to watch it every year in our house. But our video of it got eaten by the machine a few years back. Ordered this video here and it was just terrible. Not sharp. When we first saw it and our videotape was in color, not black and white like this cheap copy. Fortunately I found a really good color DVD of it by googling from santaflix . Every body needs to see this version tho. It is so much better than the movie they made later with Patti Duke. But see it in color not b&w. Go google."
5,MEADE LUX LEWIS: BLUES & BOOGIE-WOOGIE...,"This is a great disc which I'm surprized to find is still in print. Get it while you can. It features the late great Meade Lux Lewis on solo piano performing his standard classic boogie-woogie. Moreover, this disc has some really, really rare extended tracks of Meade playing some original blues for which he had an especial talent which is now not much remembered."
1,dreadful,"Eat your popcorn quick so you'll have a bowl to puke in if you can't look away from movie disasters. The screen play must have been generated by cliche software. The actors look old and embarrassed, except for Richard Gere, who leads with his usual self-satisfied countenance. The plot was even more rickety than the house perched perilously on stilts on the beach. That it survives a hurricane is as believable as ever other detail of this pathetic movie."
1,Nicholas Sparks Strikes Again!,"Why does someone always have to die in a Nicholas Sparks story? Diane Lane and Richard Gere are wonderful actors, but this movie felt like the recipe for Message in a Bottle with a few changes. I haven't read the book, so maybe it's better...maybe. But only if Gere's character doesn't die. It's not necessary to make a good story! Lame, lame movie. I was really dissapointed."
2,"Nights in Rodanthe not a ""must see""","I bought Nights in Rodanthe hoping to see a great movie set in one of my favorite vacation spots--the Outer Banks of North Carolina. There were a few shots of familiar things, but not a lot. Still, it would have been acceptable if the movie had had any substance. I found it rather boring and anxiously awaited its end. I rank it with the other duds I've seen--Cold Mountain, Australia...It was simply stated--weak."
1,never really delivered,"I am a huge Nicholas Sparks fan, and both Diane Lane and Richard Gere are favorites. But something about this movie just never delivered. I agree with some of the previous reviews, not a keeper, and definitely disappointing. Thumbs down!"
1,Sad showcase of wonderful music,"I love both Richard Gere and Diane Lane, so I can only hope that this dismal, awful movie is a one-off. Brook Benton and Dinah Washington voices were wonderful to hear - just wish they weren't in this forgettable movie."
1,rodant,This movie sucks a big one no joke I pukedSo hard I barley had enough strength to snap the disc into 50 peices
1,I kept waiting for the movie to start then it was over.,I really wasted my $2 renting this from my local library. You could watch the last 30 minutes and not miss much. The movie has a dissapointing ending. I can only assume that the book was good because of the writer and this is a case of too much editing.
2,A Painful Sap-Fest!,"I can't believe I even made it through this entire movie. The talents of both Gere and Lane are wasted in this overly dramatic, poorly written, and unbelievable sap-fest. Just when you thought it was at it's sappiest, it got even worse.I normally enjoy a good tear-jerker but this was just ridiculous. The only tears I shed were the tears of pain in having to endure such nonsense."
3,"Not very authentic, but...","My ancient copy of this cookbook is in pieces, and the recipes are not particularly authentic. In addition, it's a small book and presents only a few recipes for three distinctly different cuisines. That said, I still use the book. Even if the recipes are not authentic, most are quite good. I appreciate that each section presents typical menus for the cuisine. The sukiyaki recipe is the one my family enjoys, so the book has sentimental reasons to remain in my kitchen."
2,Difficult to read,"This book has interesting factual information but the presentation is irritating and the writing style is often arcane. In all fairness, many of the essays & reports were undoubtedly translated from other languages and that may be most of the problem. I did glean some useful information, but I felt like I had to troll through Moby Dick to do it.I very much prefer ""The Politically Incorrect Guide to Islam"" by the same author [Robert Spencer]. It is well-written, logical, and extremely educational."
2,Readability,This book was very repaticious and difficult to read. I could not finish it. To me it was if someone was trying to show off there vocabulary. The facts were good but the book is just not good reading.
4,And so...,"When Bush et al say ""Islam is a religion of peace"" they are just being political(ly correct). It is not, it is an idealogy of hate pure and simple. we don't *need* a book like this to show us, history itself is a sufficient guide to the true core Islam, but this is good place to go for those who cannot read the history."""
3,"Great Music, Lyrics are still wishy-washy","I love Mary Timony, especially during her days in Helium, and the music on Ex Hex is the best it's been during her solo career, but the lyrics are still lacking for me. It's like she puts little or no effort into writing lyrics. That being said, there are some very Rush-esque moments on Ex Hex and I mean that in a good way.This one has a lot more Umphh! than her last two, and the melodies and structure just get better and better, but it's best just to tune out the words."
3,Not wide enough,I needed a 4E shoe which Hush Puppies used to make. The widest now is 3E--not wide enough for me. Too bad.
2,not worth the money,"This game was not worth the money. The ""advanced physics"" in the game only make it harder to manuver, although it does have options for how realistic the physics are ... but they don't work. The action in the game isn't great, it's pretty slow, plus you can't tell enemy ships apart from ally ships. The is just pretty slow. The graphics aren't even all the impressive. For all you gamers out there... this game isn't worth ...bucks!"
2,There must be better books on franchising,"Michael Seid's extensive experience yields some useful insights and he explains many of the steps involved in franchising, but the book reads too much like advertorial and Seid spends way too much time trumpeting his own accomplishments. (Wendy's founder Dave Thomas' contributions to the book are woefully slim and including him as a coauthor seems to serve more as a marketing tool.) Franchising for Dummies would be a worthwhile addition to your library on the subject, but if you're looking for a single, objective, authoritarian source on the subject, keep looking."
4,Would like a second ride.,"THE BLACK CAROUSEL is an intriguing beginning but feels like a prelude to further works, rather than a complete story. How about bringing the rest of the Oxrun Station novels back into print so we can read the rest? Grant's prose is, as always, a pleasure to read."
1,Syphilomania,"Probably the most ridiculous book I have ever (half-)read! It seems to have been written by a sensationalist for sex-obsessed, screwed-up voyeurs. Who can seriously think that a diagnosis of syphilis in case of Christopher Columbus could be scientifically/medically based? Perhaps he had a chicken pox? But that would not be sensationalist enough for Ms Hayden, would it?Also, references are fiddled with to suit the most absurd hypothesis that genius must have syphilis to realise his full potential. Thomas Mann pales into insignificance with his Romantic (albeit ill-informed) ideas. Authoress - think first, and only then write, if you must!"
1,Pure Garbage,"You have to wonder about the mentality of someone who wants to show how many people had syphilis.Anyone who would even 'speculate' that the Ode to Joy of Beethoven was influenced by tertiary syphilis not only knows nothing ABOUT music, but doesn't CARE about music, either, since frankly anyone impressed with a work of art is not likely to wonder what bodily functions were being performed during its composition. Although in the case of this book I have a fair idea of what the author was doing when she wrote it.Quick! Who was Leonardo having sex with when he painted the Mona Lisa. You mean -- it doesn't matter?Maybe Beethoven was having sex with the Empress of China when he wrote the Ode to Joy. Who cares.What is deeply offensive about this book it that is romanticizes a disease which brings about terrible deaths and suggests that it has a 'positive' side by fueling 'genius.' Sick, sick, sick."
5,A GREAT SCORE FOR A GREAT MOVIE,"I must say,this is the best of Hans Zimmer sountrack ever. Don't miss it!!!!"
1,One Word.......GARBAGE a total ZERO,Use the cd's for flying frisbies. That will be your only Space Ritual.
1,Oh dear...,"...oh dear!Here is another of those pointless compilations that presents odd collections of not-quite-the-best tracks from early albums and repackages them at a silly (high) price!Avoid this album, and buy instead the ""Electronic Meditation/Alpha Centauri/Zeit"" boxed set, thereby obtaining more and better early TD music for about the same price. Or, if you want a cheaper option, check-out ""The Collection, vol 1"": a better selection of early Dream than offered here."
4,good manner book,I will definitely enjoy reading this book to my nephew. It teaches children the proper things to do in a fun way.
2,Disappointed,"As a teacher, I bought this video to show to my kids. Rather than tell about the fascinating facts the Voyager discovered for us, it focused more on the message we sent to communicate to theoretical extraterrestrials, the stories of scientists, events leading up to the Voyager, opinions and feelings of scientists, etc. Compared to what could have been covered, I found the material in this video too touchy-feely, boring, and very disappointing."
1,Horrible,"This bench terrified me: have 300lbs overhead, and not know if the bench supporting you is going to buckle is a terrifying position to be in. I can't say this strongly enough: do not risk your safety(screw the money) on this bench."
1,Garbage,"I used this bench for lying dumbbell presses, and it quickly folded where the legs meet the bench. The metal is cheap and thin, and will not take the movement of an adult with weights. If you want something for your cat to sit and watch, it's great. Otherwise it's garbage."
1,Lasted 6 weeks,"I used this bench for 6 weeks. I wasn't doing any heavy lifting. Basically, just doing some leg lefts while lying on my back. Into the 4th week, heard a little snap. The bench started feeling a little wobbly. Finally, on the 6th week while doing my leg lifts, the bench gave way and I slowly came down on one side. The metal bent down slowly, so I wasn't hurt, just disappointed. I would not recommend it."
2,No Good for CrossFit,"The bench is usable, but not sturdy or well made at all. The legs are individual components instead of one solid piece so any movement on the bench causes it to wobble at the joint where the leg connects to the bench. It was worth the price, but don't expect much. You truly are getting what you pay for."
2,good bench,"I purchased this bench to add to my home gym. After assembly I laid on the bench and it was uncomfortably slanted to the right. turns out the tabs to fasten the pad on were welded on without being leveled and slant to the right. i had to add my own shims between those tabs and the pad. I do like the bench, however, easy to assemble, stoutly built, and a thick yet firm pad. If it were not for the tabs being welded wrong I would have given this five stars for the price."
5,Great bench; good price,"I did try to find a workout/weight bench in a big box store, but they said they were out. Given that a fancier bench (too specific for what I wanted) wasn't too expensive in the store, I was shocked to go online and see other plain benches on other websites for upwards of $100. This one works great -- sturdy (I'm a larger person -- which is why I'm working out!), versatile, and simple to put together. At a good price. We're very satisfied; we're even still working out every morning!"
1,Dangerous!!!!!,"Using moderate weight, I popped a weld on the leg of this bench. If it had failed utterly before I leaped off of it, I would have been seriously injured!"
1,Not very sturdy,"This weight bench looks great. The padding is reasonably thick and it feels comfortable on your back. After the first time I used the bench I noticed that the legs were bowing in slightly on one side. I disassembled it and reassembled it in the hope that this would correct the problem. After the second use I noted that one of the legs was bowed severely. The bench is unsafe and likely to collapse with further use. Unfortunately I'll need to retire this bench and purchase another, more sturdy model. This bench would probably be appropriate for use under 150 lbs. I used it to perform bench press exercises with two 100 lb dumbbells. This weight isn't excessive, but the bench doesn't seem designed well enough to accommodate this amount of weight. I didn't see any weight limit when I decided to purchase it. The price was right, it looked great, so I dove right in and bought it. Beware."
5,Fitness bench,It's perfect. It is big enough to do basic exercises. It is light weight and it doesn't take up space.
4,Great for your home gym,"I bought this bench for my garage gym. Its a sturdy product and a value for the price. I use it along with my squat rack for bench pressing. It was easy to assemble (took only about 15 mins to put together). All you need is an adjustable wrench or a 11/16'' socket. It comes with two allen wrenches for all of the screws. Its also eligible for Amazon Prime. I'm happy with this purchase, however, I do feel that the bench is a bit wide. For those who plan on using it for bench pressing and are used to a standard width, this may feel a bit wide at the bottom of the press."
2,Didn't sit right,"The bench didn't sit flat on the floor after assembly. So I contacted customer service and requested them to send the defective part. 2 weeks and no part yet. Also the bench capacity is only 300lb. So if you are 175 lbs, you can only lift up to 125 lbs which is not much for barbell bench press. So if you are just a beginner, then this bench might be OK, else it is of little use."
3,Historiography or Everything But the Wannsee Conference,"This is more a book on historiography than on history. It tries to put in chronological order the different steps that were taken that lead to the Final Solution: the extermination of European Jewry, decision that seems to have been taken in Wannsee.It gets entangled in the effort, and therefore never moves on with the Conference, which is what made me by this book in the first place. If there are no documents to exactly know what was the purpose of the conference, and what were the personal stands of the people gathered there on the issue, we should have been warned in the title.Discussing over dates and the proper chronology of decisions regarding the Holocaust seems to me like discussing security measures when the thiefs are already in the building. Who cares? The author never gets there, I mean, to the Conference. It was aggravating."
4,Good buy,I originally ordered a size L and had to send it back for a M.. I ordered two of these one in another style and wear this one the most.. I would order from them again.
2,Failed the rain test,"It worked quite well at the beginning,warm,comfy,space friendly. However, i've now experienced water seeping thru the hood(thru the material) while the strings were tied and secure...My hair at the top of my head got real wet in the rain. I don't know if mine has a fault, as no other part leaks as yet."
2,It is not water resistant after washing.,"I bought this jacket for a trip to Boston and needed a peice of raingear that could be bundeled up really small and fit into a purse. This worked great for that and looked pretty decent on. My complaint was that was sort of rain resistant the for the trip, but after washing it upon arrival home it lost all rain resistancy."
4,Great for travel,"We bought two of these windbreaker/rain jackets for our recent trip to Europe. We wanted something light and compact that we could keep in our packs. We both ordered an xl (my husband wears a men's xl and I a ladies xl) and found they were very roomy on both of us, enough so they could fit over top our day packs. We had no issues with becoming too hot and stuffy when wearing them on rainy, humid days. Over all, very happy with this jacket!"
2,.,"This Beatles cd is just ok,sounds very keyboardy. However there is another Beatles cd that does sound like lullaby music.you'l understand if you had both-although id recommend the other cd"
3,Just average lullaby cd,"Nice change for parents from the usual lullaby cd's, but not a top pick for putting baby to bed."
2,Not so much,"I adore the wrangler aura twill pants. Clean lines, slimming, etc. The jeans - not so much. I really wish I had simply returned them instead of seeing if they washed a bit better.Sizing is all wrong. You need to order at least 1 if not 2 sizes smaller than you really wear. A little insulting as though you're going to like these pants better because the number is smaller? At any rate, the fit is pretty loose, to the point of simply looking like they just don't fit.Admittedly, I have zero backside which is difficult to make look good in any jeans but these make it even more of an issue.If you decide to try these - expect that you may have to send the first pair back. Keep all the paperwork & shipping info. Oh & washing actually made the fit looser. The color is really very dark - sort of a blue-black."
2,It's not Anderson it's the Jockey brothers,"I think this album is not for Anderson fans. It is for hardcore urban R&B fans. The main problem is for me is that the music is too simple, very monotonious sometimes. I agree with those who say that the first two songs R ok (and may be Sad) but the rest of the CD is not so remarkable like Jon's other works. Skip this one, believe me, it's a weak effort of Jon's."
1,Pass this up,"Definitely the worst album produced by Jon Anderson. Listening to this album is a total waste of time. Buy Olias of Sunhillow, Song of Seven, Angel's Embrace or any album that Jon made with Vangelis instead."
3,Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance,"I don't know what all the fuss is about. I've tried to get in to this book at least three different times and I just can't stay focused. It seems to be a very popular book, but for some reason I just can't get excited about it."
2,"Good reasons to like it, but it's not for everyone","There are good solid reasons why many readers rave about ""Master and Commander."" The battle scenes are exciting, a couple of the characters are intriguing, the historical background is interesting, and the voyage around the Mediterranean is sort of fun. That said, the novel isn't for everyone. I found myself too bogged down by the quirky period dialogue and arcane nautical terms to derive much enjoyment out of this book. To boot, the plot seems pretty thin (although things thicken up a bit towards the end). I think it would be best to judge ""Master and Commander"" after reading several books in the series. But after reading the first, I don't feel compelled to plow through any more."
5,Superb... absolutely,"These are the finest historical novels that I have ever read. They not only provide exciting reading, but they immerse you in the world of late 18th/early 19th century England as nothing I have ever seen before. I can't say enough good things about the series. One caveat, however: give yourself some time to become accustomed to the language. It is somewhat sticky at first, but after a short while, it becomes totally clear and natural."
3,Good but slow...,"For the most part, I enjoyed this book. As I approached the end, however, the story became tedious. After the last battle with a Spanish frigate, the plot seemed to fall apart and I was mostly relieved when the book ended. On the other hand, O'Brian's prose was excellent, his characters well developed, and his plot exciting. I would recommend this book to someone looking for an adventure, as this is a great epic at sea. Even though Master and Commander got slow, I still plan to read the next nineteen in the series ;)"
2,A disappointing book with trite characterisations.,"This book was well recommended to me, and I suggested it to my bookclub. Few of the members of the bookclub were able to finish the book due to its over dependence on naval terms. My main objection to the book is that it never seemed to reach the potential it seemed to have. I was left hanging wanting to learn some useful insight into Jack or Stephen. The book completely missed the potential it had to develop an enthralling and enlightening characterisation of men in adverse conditions. Basically not much fun, worthwhile adventure or depth of perception in this read."
1,I hope the movie was better than this,"Master ans Commander is a rambling poorly written book. Whoever said that this book was a great historical sea novel must have been smoking some funny tobacco or took a bribe, this book sucked. the author used foreign terms that was way over my head. I don't know Greek,French Spanish or any other language than English. Reading this book became a chore to read. I have read and enjoyed textbooks more than this book."
3,A Bit Less Wholesome Than I'd Prefer,"We loved the movie so we bought the book thinking it would be even better. In this instance we were disapointed. The writting style is excellent and engaging, but there is a bit more realism (sexualy) than I'd prefer. This does not enter until about 1/2 way through the book and I was very disapointed when my concience demanded that I read no further."
5,High Recommendation to Other Women!,"I am in agreement with the reader from Sydney, Australia! While this is not usual fare for women, they should read this book! It is excellently well-written and exciting. Any woman that enjoys Regency Romance will find this book a welcome change of pace. On the other hand, men who enjoy the sea and war stories will also enjoy this as there is a good deal of action and adventure and sea-faring terminology. I am recommending it to my husband, who is retired US Navy. I believe this to be a book written for anyone that enjoys a good tale."
3,Lots of flavor...BUT.,"The characters are well balanced, with good points and bad points. The setting is well studied and the book even comes with a picture of a square-rigged ship with a legend to help you know which sail is which. The problem comes when you get half-way through and find yourself lost, because there seems to be no plot. I have tried TWICE to read it from start to finish and always just give up about half-way. It does not seem to keep my interest after the first few chapters. In most cases Mr. O'Brian is able to do a MUCH better job than Mr. Forester, in all but one skill: Keeping Me Interested."
3,Nelson's Navy,"It had all the traditional historical naval fiction elements. The plot was somewhat thin, the characters quirky. Still, headed in the right direction.A Tainted Dawn: The Great War (1792-1815) Book I"
3,"Audio edition: look for the Patrick Tull narration, by far the best","I'm a huge Aubrey/Maturin fan and have read the entire series twice and listened to the books on tape three times. There are at least 3 different narrators available, but the one offered by Amazon is not good and saps the stories of life. By FAR the best is Patrick Tull, who narrated the series but is only available on CD as far as I know. He brings the characters to life and does a great job with the various accents (though attempts at sounding like a woman aren't very successful)- and this series is so excellent that you're cheating yourself if you don't listen to his version (available at many public libraries). I enjoy the convenience of the audio format but wish Amazon would offer the best version."
5,I'd always read reviews saying these 20 or so books are THE sailing era novels to read. Now I'm convinced!,"My uncle first told me about these books over a decade ago. But, I never saw them in a book store--I probably wasn't looking very hard--and I never bothered to order online. So, this was the first book I bought using my iPhone's Kindle app. So glad I did!There is a labeled drawing of a ship at the beginning of the book, necessary because O'Brian doesn't simplify the nautical terms as he spins out his tale. Despite the nautical terms and the manner of speaking--that I assume is accurate to the era--this is a very easy book to read, and the pages flew by. The descriptive writing that describes naval strategy of the era, details of life aboard ship, and the personality quirks that make characters breathe all add up to top quality nautical literature. I wish I had started reading these in my teen years. I can't wait to read the next one!"
3,Very Interfemmeting and inquisitive!,I have found this book to be profoundly informative. It has not only broadened my knowledge of capitalism in my community today but gave me a sense of pride for my country.
4,"Right People, Right Place, Right Time","It's hard to call any recording essential, but if you like swing, this is a great one to have. It documents the moment when Harry James, Gene Krupa, Benny Goodman, and Fletcher Henderson were all in the same place making music together. Most famously, they recorded ""Sing Sing Sing"" (the original two-sided single of which is on this collection), one of the most artistically executed #1 singles that has ever shown up on the American charts. The rest of this collection may not be as great as that incredible high point, but much of it is nearly as good, and four or five of the songs have alternate takes here, including ""Camel Hop,"" my personal favorite among the more neglected singles."
4,Excellent book for quick overview on 1812,"Very enjoyable. The author did a great job at breaking the war down to basics. The more I read about this war, the more I shake my head. A war that was poorlu executed. poorly run and sometimes well fought. We owe Napolean our freedom for without him, Great Britain would have spanked up extremely hard. It was worth my time reading and added to what I have read with other books on 1812."
5,A WONDERFUL REINTRODUCTION TO A TOPIC AND A FASCINATING STORY FROM HIGH SCHOOL,"i learned about the war of 1812 during high school, and was fascinated by it even back then. i've always wanted to revisit the topic but never really found a book readily at hand that looked interesting. this one is written like a novel that you can curl up with and read by the fire.don't get me wrong, it's full of factual information but it is presented in such a coherent and interesting way that you can watch the events slowly building up and unfolding as if you were there and participating in the campaigning. i picked up this book, and didn't put it down until i had finished it which for me is a feat in itself as i generally read only a few pages a day of most of the books i readi'm thinking of revisiting this book sometime as i truly want to know the details of this incredible war that truly forged a nation, proud and strong."
3,An ok option,"I am reading this after taking an interest in the War of 1812 due to the bicentennial. The style and orientation of this book is for a general audience, and it is easy to follow. Having said that I was not overly impressed. It is mostly a retelling of other narratives that are summaries in fewer pages, and it lacks the punch of a new interpretation. It's also a little too nationalistic for me--too focussed on the U.S. and how it faired in the war and not enough about the other sides. I can't help wondering about Canada and Britain in all this. The U.S. was after all a tiny not-so-significant country so it is hard to swallow the idea that the U.S. was running the show--sort of like Iraq running the war agenda there. Still, for anyone new to the subject this is not a bad choice, just not the best one."
3,Very funny,"If doesn't come close to Dressed to Kill, but since I hadn't watched that one for at least a year, Unrepeatable was very funny. We enjoyed Eddie's wonderful sense of humor as always."
3,Wrong choice for me,"The book was received in great shape but the choice I made was not the right choice for me. The error was on my part. Not enough photos, mainly written instructions."
5,Comix touchstone.,"For me and many comics guys, a touchstone work that spiralled my interest away from the juvenile houses of Marvel, DC to real, mature work. Is a Pulitzer enough?It's a story of a father and son as much of as a Holocaust survivor, warts and all.Get it. You will not be disappointed"
1,Bad book,"This is probably the worst book i've ever read. If you are looking for a horrible book to fall asleep with, then wake up screaming at the horrible comic book format, this is perfect."
5,A real treasure,"I had been meaning to read this set (vol. I and II) for a long time and am so glad that I finally did. I wasn't sure how I would like the comic book format but after a few chapters, I felt that it actually enhanced the story, rather than detract from it. This is a true story of the Holocaust, as told by the author's father. Ironically, we learn that the the author is also a survivor...of his Holocaust survivor parents.I don't think I can say anything about these books that hasn't already been said so I won't. But I do highly recommend MAUS, and I believe it might actually appeal more to a younger audience (high schoolers, college) more so than to an adult audience. I think there is a lot to be learned from MAUS. Excellent books."
5,Sharon's review,"I believe that this book deserves 5 out of 5 stars. It gives an insight on how the Jew's were mistreated. They lived in horrible conditions, and were forced to do intense work everyday. It is extremely depressing knowing what these Jew's went through, and how we human's can torture ourselves.I recommend this book to everyone who is able to read. This kind of a good history book, which shows what really happened. It is not something to relive, but it is something to remember all those who suffered the pain and torture. So in conclusion, this book should read by anyone."
5,Must read,Loveeee this book. I couldn't put it down when I was reading it. This is a most read book all the way
4,An important graphic novel about the Holocaust.,"MAUS is about as educational as any graphic novel could hope to be. The problem is the subject matter does not make for entertainment even though MAUS is a graphic novel and the characters are all Animal Farm type creatures, there is more than just a touch of Orwell here. As it stands Art Spiegelman has spent years drawing this book and it delivers a powerful and often horrifying account of survival. There are a few of these types of political graphic novels and MAUS seems to be the #1 candidate for the one you should read if you want to venture down that path. The problem is, you don't really enjoy what you are reading and it is hard to call it entertainment. Important, lengthy reading that I actually covered in the space of a few months on the toilet seat (not a bad way to get through this I might add). Like I said, it is not something you will enjoy but you will be glad that you read it."
1,Anti-Polish Propaganda,"While this a moving account of one families experience during the holocaust, the depiction of Poles as pigs in Spiegelman's ""Maus"" an unfair and highly insulting caricature. Poles suffered horribly under Nazi occupation. Few nations suffered worse. Six million Poles were murdered. Roughly half were Jewish and half Gentile. In fact exterminating Poles was also part of the Nazi master-plan. They were victims and to portray them as pigs is a grave injustice. While I read the reviews pointing out pigs have positive traits it is disingenuous to present the selection of the pig as representative of the Pole as anything but a slur. I suggest when reading this book you research the positive events in the 1000 history of Polish Jews. For starters, visit Yad Vashem in Jerusalem. Over 11,000 'Righteous Gentiles' are honored; almost 5,000 are Polish. These are non-Jews who risked their lives to save Jews during the Holocaust."
4,Excellent and original for the most part,"I can't argue with the critics. The Maus books are exteremely accessible. The story line is riveting. The pictures are dramatic, and the black-and-white heightens the intense drama (as with Schindler's List.) My complaint lies in the presentation of the father, Vladek, in New York in the eighties. Art Spiegelman includes scenes of Vladek going about his living and telling Holocaust stories in New York City. Often, Vladek is presented as temperamental, domineering, miserly, and whiny. I can see why Art Spiegelman would like to present the elderly version of his father as a three-dimensional human character, and not as some god. However, Art owes his magnum opus to Vladek; since the presentation of Vladek's flaws adds nothing to the central focus of the book, I believe it to be disgraceful. Hence, I give Maus four stars instead of five."
4,I love nerds,"It took me a couple days to let this film sink in.It's so wonderfully bittersweet. I fell in love with ""Hal"" and I loved watching him gradually gain confidence.My favorite scene is when he got pizza. Such a great moment.You have to see this movie!"
3,"Product is good, but item went on sale within 2 weeks of purchase & company would not give price adjustment:(","Stable rack, adjusts for long garments, good casters, etc. Much better than the racks sold at department stores. Would give higher rating if company was more customer friendly."
2,Not good for drying clothes....it rusts.,"I bought this rack to hang my hand washables while they dried. While this IS a great rack for hanging clothes it's not good for drying them. The first rust spot I noticed was on a welded area. While I was very disapointed it rusted at all (given the price and my high hopes), I wanted to believe it was just something in the welding material but that the main drying areas would be fine. Wrong. Just noticed some rust developing in the middle of one of the bottom horizontal rods. Now I'll have to lay something over the areas where moisture may drip to forestall any further rust. What a big disappointment!"
4,Greeeat except missing a piece.,"Great and sturdy, just what I was looking for. It's a little annoying that it was missing a piece to the top bar of the bottom double bars...so it isn't as sturdy as it could've been, however it holds up just fine with out it. I have it completely full, squishing clothes back to back and everything. I'd buy another if I had the money."
4,Elegant cologne,"A scent which is unmistakeably masculine and elegant. To my nose, the dominant notes seem to start with a coriander, sandalwood and nutmeg nutmeg only to drydown to a pleasant, but not too raw green vetiver. The sillage is moderate to strong so a little goes a long way. I find this superior and more complex than Gucci Pour Homme. Envy has some of the notes of GPH, i.e. Ginger, cedar and lavender, but is far more superior. Gucci Envy best fits with formal attire. I would also wear this as an evening fragrance and I think that this is appropriate for colder weather. Enjoy it!"
5,"Easy on the Eyes, Food for the Soul","Many so-called large print Bibles are not exactly all that readable for those of us who are visually impaired to some degree. This Amplified Bible is not only a profound amplification of the syntax (if you have used an Amp in conjunction with any other translation,you know it's power) but the Large clear print in this edition is a refreshing amplification of the TEXT itelf.The font is not quite Giant but close.Having studied with my regular print Amp for nigh-on twenty years it knew it was time to upgrade when I found myself reaching for a magnifier every time I reached for the Bible. If you love the Amplified Bible and desire real LARGE PRINT this is a great buy!btw,The MacArthur Study Bible Large Print is also a very readable and enlightening edition.I use the NASB edition also and it's font is large enough to use with just my glasses.Highly recommended. Prov. 2:1-11"
5,ammplify your study,"good product.concise,to the point.at the same time informative. good for all who want deeper understanding. five more words are required!"
4,hard to navigate,"Love the Bible but the format is hard to go from one book, chapter and verse. My smartphone is faster with Youversion Bible to find a specific verse."
4,Historical perspective on this translation,"Francis Siewart was the primary translator of the Greek and Hebrew scriptures that make up this volume. Throughout most of the time she spent on this task, she suffered from cancer and, over a period of twenty years, had approximately twent-five surgeries on this cancer.Ms.Siewart first translated the New Testament. She was not expected to complete this due to her illness. However, as a testament to her faith and the power of faith, she not only finished the New Testament, she went on to complete the translation of the Old Testament in two parts before she passed away.I am not a deeply religious person myself, but her work is a strong argument for the power of faith.I met her on a few occasions during the time she was doing this work. She had been like an aunt to my mother and father and they called her ""Aunt Francis"" even though there was no real family relationship--only love and friendship."
3,It's okay,I am a new kindle user so that may affect how I feel about it. I find i difficult to maneuver thru and find texts quickly. I is a nice version for plain reading.
2,Not too happy here,"I own this bible in paperback and I use it quite often. However, the Kindle Fire version is next to impossible to move around in as it does not show the name of the book you are in, nor does it allow you to search for a particular book while you are in another book (i.e. reading in Psalms and then trying to go to Proverbs or another book).I do not use this much at all and I am looking for another more user-friendly bible for the Fire."
5,Best possible Bible but not a starter Bible.,"This is the Bible for deeper study. It extrapolates the meaning of the Greek and Hebrew words; giving all the intended meaning of each phrase. It's not a pick-and-choose what the scripture means but and expansion based on all the nuances of the translated languages. NIV was my ""learner"" Bible and read it for years but now I read nothing but the AMP."
4,I like the idea...,"I like the idea of getting different translations of the Hebrew, Latin, and Greek words (example, word ____ was translated into heaven, but the amplified bible explains that the meaning is really heaven/among the stars/in the clouds, etc, so you get the full understanding of the passage).I like the idea, though I don't know how it really changes the meaning of the text. But if you are looking to pick and probe further into your reading, this is a helpful translation."
1,Not worth the Money,"When I say not worth the money, the Word of God is priceless, but the bonding of the leather cover was not up to par and it was not at all what I was expecting. It looks more like a gift bible. I returned it."
3,A paperback this large is not useable.,I should not have purchased a paperback Bible. It is very thick and it is very difficult to handle in paperback form.
4,Amplified Bible,This bible was my first bible i owned & i liked it a lot so I gave it as a gift to one of my friends who is not yet a follower of Christ but is choosing to read this Bible I gave Him because it's easier for him to understand
4,Good price and easy to use,"I bought the strips about a month ago, they shipped fairly fast. It's pretty easy to use and interpret them although it's a little odd the urine would have to be at room temperature, but it didn't say whether the temperature affected it or not."
1,Shockingly poor title.,"The subtitle of this book ""Administration and Development"" is comletely inaccurate. The foreward begins: ""This book is for the JBoss content developer and administrator"".No it isn't. It should be called ""JBoss Internals"", which is what it actually covers. Whoever chose the title was an idiot. How anyone could imagine that a book on JBoss that doesn't cover EJB deployment is aimed at administrators is beyond me.Less than useless (if I could give it zero stars I would), as the ""authorized"" book, it will actively discourage people from learning JBoss."
5,"""He'll go mad when I tell him it's the bucket woman!""","This is British comedy at its best.The antics of Hyacinth Bouquet and ""Dicky"" (e.g., when Dicky fixes Elizabeth's ""...dinky little car"" by pointing at the engine, or when ""Richard wants to be a nun too!"") must surely be among the funniest moments in British television history. I highly recommend buying the ""full bouquet"" if you are a fan of British comedy."
2,Tough one to rate,"If you hear this collection on its own with no prior knowledge of Bowie's music or career, you will laugh. If you know everything about him 70's and beyond, you will still laugh, but you'll be able to appreciate the beginnings of a man trying to twist popular culture in his own image. Definitely not worth the asking price, but find a friend who owns it or track it down in a used CD store and hear some EARLY Davey Jones history."
1,"Not sterling silver, and NOT resizeable!","The ring came only a couple of days after I ordered it, and it was just as pretty as the picture makes it look-- but when I took it to a jewelry repair shop to have it sized down to fit me, they discovered that the ring is only plated in sterling silver and that the inner metal is not resizeable. It destroyed the ring. I was very disappointed because it was beautiful and the company's website swears that they use only genuine metals and gems... short story, they lied."
2,not so hot,"Squirrels still get into the feeder, especially if there is a tree nearby where they can jump."
1,Inaccurate!,"This item is completely inaccurate. I placed it where recommended, outside the vehicle away from engine heat and wind, and it was 10-20 degrees off at all times. Don't waste your money!!"
4,"English subtitles, please.","I know this is a Korean product, but English subtitles would have made this a 5-star item for me because it includes the Italian soundtrack. I'm one who prefers subtitles in foreign films, because I like hearing the actor's real voices. The english dubbing in this stinks: sounds like they did it in someones' bathroom.In Italian, the discussion between Penelope and the ""beggar"" is much more effective because you can hear all the subtleties the actress put into her lines as she expresses her despair. She actually has a very nice voice. In the Italian soundtrack, you also hear the breeze in the courtyard while Ulysses is saying hello to his old dog Argus. Nearly all the background atmospherics are lost in the english dub: The ocean sounds like someone swishing water in the bathtub.Time for a remastering job..........."
4,Tragic Hero Seeks Ithiaca,"The orginal Homeric hero, tossed about by the Gods of Olympus as he spends 20 years from home. The overbearing suitors run their generous hostess to her limits as the son, Telemechus prepares to defend the honour of a hero long since forgotten. The return from the Trojan war was long fought for ullysse and his crew. Ten long years filled with various adventures created by the gods are told very nicely in this movie. The special effects, which arrive in the early 60's with Jason and the Argonaughts, though missing here should not take away from the sense of adventure which Douglas beautifully portrays. This should be on all young men's list to see. Though lacking the modern star wars flair, 90 minutes of watching a hero return to his homeland Ithiaca still can be moving. Hokey- i say not- fundamental hero, yes. Homer's cunning warrior king is very nicely presented in this classic of 1955."
4,Good for the kids...,"I saw this movie as a child and still remembered many scenes...although I didn't remember that most of the movie is dubbed for English...even many of the scenes with Kirk Douglas... The DVD audio wasn't very good...but not hearing any other version (either VHS or broadcast) I don't really have anything to compare it to. Perhaps they're bad on other media types too, or I guess that with DVD's we've just come to expect too much...;)... The kids enjoyed the story very much. Nothing really objectionable."
1,Poor Adapation,The movie is not an adapation of the book. It is a good adventure movie but too far from the text and left out important detaails form the text.
5,One Of Our FAVORITES!,This book is a big hit in our house! We love the rhythm of the rhyme and the pictures are very entertaining!I would highly recommend this book.
5,Plug for this book,"This is an excellent book. A beginner's guide to the Tarot, it explains everything in plain English. It mostly talks about the Celtic Cross spread, but that's ok because the Celtic Cross spread is not too hard and not too easy, just right. I do a one- card reading every day, and I have been eerily accurate. For example, I got the Queen of Pentacles, the symbol of a good mother, the day I had to babysit. Anyway...buy this book!"
4,Very helpful,I've been wanting to learn how to read the cards for a long time and this book has been so helpful. I love the break down of each card. I like that it's simple and not condecending too.
4,Proud to be American!,"Fastinating and well written, an unforgettable story! You never know what life has in store for you and in India if you survive with all your body parts in tact you can consider yourself lucky! Not only does this book make you count your blessings, it offers a window into a world few of us ever knew existed. Picture life as a tough game of roulette where someone else is holding the gun! An unlikely union of 4 believable and likeable charcters that together build a peaceful and loving environment in a cold and unpeaceful world. Life is pure and good while wrapped in their protective union but reality hits hard when they step outside. It's uplifting to see that even under such harsh living conditions love and peace, however fleeting and temporary, is possible and preferable!"
4,A Fine Balance,Our book club read this book and while it was in my hands I felt I was living in India. The author captured me! An interesting look at a disturbing time and a window into the souls of those who live so differently from us.
1,This book was horribly depressing. Don't read it!,"Do not read this book unless you want to be down for days afterwards. I would give it 4 stars because it was well written. The subject matter is another story altogether, pun intended. That's where the 1 star comes in.This book is absolutely tragic, and very disturbing. If I had it to do over again, and was warned about its ultra-depressing ending, I would have passed on it, absolutely no doubt. Yeah, it brings to life all of the troubles of India's poor, but do you really want to go there? You have been warned. If you hate movies or books that end with pure tragedy, let this one slide."
5,Even better while reading it in India!,"I am currently studying abroad in India and I picked up this book at a bookfair in Calcutta. I can't put it down! This book IS India. Other reviewers complain that the book is depressing because of all of the horrific things that happen throughout the novel, but these things HAPPEN and it's amazing how Mistry has been able to document it all. India isn't about covering up the sad aspects of life because they exist and they must be recognized and accepted as part of life along with the positive."
4,I can't put it down. Rohinton puts you right there!!,"I don't get much time for reading between three kids and a business but for the past week the laundry is piling up and the house is a mess! I can't put the book down, it gets depressing but the way the author put s you right in the middle of the tragedies you have to have a glimpse of hope that if you read on things HAVE TO GET BETTER. I am only three quarters through it but I must finish it soon or the laundry will TAKE OVER!!"
2,"Slow moving, and riddled with tired stereotypes","This is the first novel I have read by Rohinton Mistry. What struck me about this novel was its incredible succession of pessimistic stereotypes used to talk about the state of Indian society, polity, etc.. I don't object to the use of stereotypes as a gimmick to sell(anything that sells is OK, I guess), but it is sad to see a needlessly maudlin and unreal depiction of India win critical acclaim as well. The narrative is long-winded but not rich - mere detail cannot capture the essence, Mr. Mistry. If you must read it, go ahead, but at the very least, take Mr. Mistry with a large pinch of salt."
2,stupidity and filth,I cannot find a single character to sympathize with. The author keeps using Indian words I have to look up. Why doesn't he say day care center if that's what he means?Dina is stupid and mistreats her employees. Her employees are stupid and don't demand lunch breaks or fair wages.The whole country is filthy and unjust. I despise everything about it. I quit reading 1/4 of the way through.
2,Like Watching the Grass Grow,"I am not a professional book reviewer or critic. However, I am an avid reader, and this is the 3rd book in recent memory that I could not finish because it did not hold my interest - and moved slowly. The first two were: Cold Mountain and Infinite Jest.If you are like me, very busy with minimal time to read, this is not the book for you."
1,Laughable. Literally.,"This book is a piece of trash. I've never read about so much death and destruction. Someone dies, gets raped, or castrated on every other page. At times, instead of making me sympathetic to the plight of the severely unfortunate characters in the book, I found myself laughing, and waiting for the poor fools to fall into their next hilarious misfortune (again, always only a few pages away). India was (and still is) a fairly harsh place to live in for poor untouchables, but this book describes conditions which are so obviously untrue, only the most simple of readers would believe. Shame on you ""Rohinton"" for trying to mislead ignorant readers.Don't waste your money on this filth."
1,I threw it in the garbage,"I threw this book away before getting through the first 100 pages. I was dissapointed. There were too many sex scences, I guess it would be a good book if you do not mind that sort of thing."
2,Read Midnight's Children by Rushdie,"if you want to read an exceptional book saying the same things as this one but MUCH, MUCH better.Mistry should be embarrassed to be writing, or rather re-writing, Midnight's Children with less spark, creativity, and far less to actually say. It is unoriginal!Although this book is good, I frankly couldn't get past that I had JUST read the Rushdie previous to this book and felt like Mistry should have been chastized rather than lauded for putting this book out.Oprah should pick up the Rushdie too."
2,"I tried--I really, really tried","I had a vague idea of what this book was about when I first started. But I had heard such wonderful things that I decided to give it a shot.After several agonizing weeks of pushing myself to keep on going, I quit halfway through. I think the author's intention was good. But the writing style was hard to follow, and included so much extraneous information that it was hard to keep the characters straight. The author wrote extensively on the history of so many character's lives that they began to blend together. What I think would have been an amazing story about the human spirit got lost in tedious writing and unnecessary information."
1,slow and depressing,"I thought this book was terrible. I read maybe the first 100 pages and had to force myself to read that far. My friend finished it and said the end was just as slow as the beginning. Basically a lot of terribly depressing things happen, with no bright or meaningful moments to draw you into the characters. It is not worth reading at all. If you want a book about India that is awesome read ""Necter in a Sieve"". Thanks."
3,A not so fine balance.,"As much as I really wanted to hate this book, in the end I found it very moving and I felt a great loss when I finished reading it. The book is well written and I found myself being swept along in an incredible journey. For this alone, I would give the book a 4 or 5 star rating.In fairness however, I must take issue with the magnitude of suffering and loss that occurs to the characters. Tragic events occur with such frequency that the story often becomes simply unbeliveable. With so much tragedy, I found myself wondering to what the 'Balance' in the books title actually refers."
3,A Fine Balance,"The book describes life in India and the trials of a family of ""untouchables."" Even after India's independence from Britain, they are still treated terribly by the upper classes. I find it difficult to stay interested because of the multitude of foreign names of the characters. It's hard to keep track. I think I am intimidated by the 603 pages to read, also. I am reading this for a Book Club and I may not even finish it in time..I am happy with the prompt delivery and the good condition of the book. Kudos to you.Literarily yours,Joyce Noe"
3,Couldn't put it down,"Even though this book is not an uplifting story or one of those happy ending books, the story itself is really compelling. I enjoyed the look into India's caste system and once I got into the book I could not put it down.This is not beach reading, nor is it as depressing as some other Oprah book picks. If you enjoy reading about Indian culture you will enjoy this."
2,"Tragedy, Tragedy, Tragedy","This book is so tragegic, it is depressing. One unspeakable tragedy follows another this entire book, where's the happiness? The happiness described in this book is when you are not enduring an unimaginable tragedy. You can not imagine how bad these characters lives are until you read this book. And you think, well now that they have all had such hardship and struggle, now there will be a little happiness, a little hope for things to come, NO- in this book, more tragedy. Although it is well written, with beautiful characters, it overwelms you with heartache, to the point where you can feel no more pain for these characters. You have no hope for them and your at a loss of how to feel when faced with more tragedy, to the point where I am numb from it. I wanted to finish this book to end the suffering of all of the characters."
5,An amazing book,"This book was so compelling I couldn't put it down. I don't want to give away what happens in the book, but it really made me appreciate how easy we have it in the US or the West in general."
3,A Disapointment,"This book was recommended to me by a friend. I found the characters to be very real and engaging. However, the book was too long. I found myself getting bored at times when the explaining and story telling seemed endless. Much of the book was slow too. But I would have to say that the biggest disapointment was the fact that the hardships of the characters went steadily downhill throughout the entire book, clear to the end. There was nothing redeeming about the end - VERY DEPRESSING."
1,broken kindle edition,"the book was engaging and a little depressing, but somehow it didn't work right on my kindle. Beware.every new chapter became a new obstacle. A blank page would resist being turned, and to get to the next page, I had to jump forward and slip back to where i hoped was the beginning of the chapter."
3,Balance?,"This story draws the reader in, with endearing and lively characters whose lives intersect in an unnamed city in India. The backdrop is the temporary State of Emergency called by Prime Minister Indira Gandhi in 1975, a tumultuous political time affecting the daily lives of many. Each character's personal life struggles are balanced by hope for the future and snippets of real happiness found in blossoming new relationships. Certain scenes brought tears to my eyes, the writing was poetic and captured a range of emotions.However, somewhere into the novel, there is a decided turn, as if dark storm clouds roll in and perpetually hover over the main characters. One begins to wonder - does the author have a chip on his shoulder that he is working out?"
4,Well woven story,Really enjoyed the way Mistry was able to bring to life each of the 4 protagonist's perspective to the story. It's sad and full of symbolism with the interconnection of various people's lives which cut across religious and caste lines.This was the first book I read by Mistry and I have been very impressed. Excellant flow and character building.One truly gets absorbed in each protagonist's perspective. Though I feel that Maneck's character was not built as strongly and real as the other ones.Gives a good feel for Indian politics in the 70s as well.
2,Not a fine balance,"I agree with the overwhelming consensus that this is a beautifully, masterfully written book. And I understand that it's an expose at it's heart. And I read it thoroughly and gave it my full attention, but I have one big glaring complaint: it's unrealistic. Really? All of that to those 2 people? Really? Really? Om and Ishvar are all of the poorest, most wretched of Dicken's characters rolled into 2 and never redeemed. For me, it would have had a bigger impact and a richer reception if he had spread the tragedies out a bit (or even just let up a some on the molten metals poured into ears, the deforming of children, the bodies trampled by cars and trains, the hangings and finger nail extractions). I don't need a happy ending, but I'm more revolted right now than transformed."
2,Way too depressing to be enjoyable,"Of all of Oprah's picks, this has to be the most depressing -- and that's saying a lot!!! A book doesn't have to be lighthearted and fluffy for me to enjoy it but I wanted to throw myself in front of a train after almost every chapter. I read each chapter cringing in fear of what was to come. That said, the book is extremely well-written and vividly describes life in India during historically tumultuous times. I would give the writing ***** but only gave the book ** because I just didn't enjoy the story."
5,A fine read,"I have not been this emotionaly moved buy a book,Since I can remeber when.It has been 2 weeks since I finished,(A fine balance). yet still it haunts my memory.A truly great novelbuy it read it pass it on."
2,"4"" and 6"" Heavy Duty Ball End Pegboard Hooks for 1/4 ""","I ordered both the 4"" and 6"" heavy duty ball end pegboard hooks for 1/4 inch pegboard, 12 of each to use to hang shovels and rakes and stuff in my garage.When I opened the package the parts looked like good quality hooks, but when I went ot put them up I found that do not fit the pegboard properly. Instead of hanging straight out they point up at an angle. It appears that the two pieces of wire were not fixtured properly when they were welded together. Good price but poor quality."
4,Espionage amongst the Spanish Armada,"Another installment in the Gresham series this is an entertaining story of spying for England in the Elizabethan age. Gresham is surrounded again by enemies. As he battles foes both domestic and foreign Gresham conquers incredible odds, saves a beautiful girl and eventually the country.With Mannion by his side he is unbeatable and the story makes for a good read. I must confess it took me awhile to get into it but once it grabbed me I was hooked.Enjoy."
1,do not buy,"I bought this for my treo 650. The fit was quite tight and you had to push down to get it onto the cradle. After less than a month, the sync/charging prongs collasped through the floor rendering the product useless. Also no hot sync button on the cradle (not as big a deal) but extra step to hotsync via icon on device. Stick with the manufacturer cradle."
4,Good Tony Vega music,To me this is one of Tony Vega's better albums. If your a Tony Vega fan your gonna like this album.
5,funny and intersting,"I loved this book. The format was a little different but I really liked it. It mas like reading a really long magazine interview. Shane is funny, intelligent, tragic, irreverent, and spiritual all at the same time"
4,Worth getting but has it's limitations,"I think I am quite harsh when I write my reviews, but this is because I have been on all sides of things - a player, a coach, and now a sport scientist working at a high level.There are good areas of this book that will be very useful to coaches of all levels. However, the areas on anaerobic work, speed development, and weight training really are poor and even misleading. Bangsbo knows more about improving the endurance and match fitness of soccer players than anyone out there. I feel he does a dis-service to himself when writing about other areas in which he is not so strong.Worth getting for half the book, however don't take the information in the above areas as Gospel."
3,Recommended by my doctor,"I haven't ordered this book yet, but it was recommended my pshyciatrist. As for causing more pain, well, when it comes to matters like these, it's going to happen. I will be using this in conjunction with medication to help me out of my depression, caused by my mentally abusive childhood. It usually gets worse before it gets better...No pain, No gain...I am doing this for me and my family."
5,Great Blacklight for Theatre Use!,I design lights for dance concerts (higher education and professional companies) and bought this blacklight to use to fulfill a director's request. I needed to cover the entire stage (30x30ish) with a blacklight wash and be able to control it from a light board. This instrument did the trick! It was the cheapest option I could find to meet my requirements and it worked great! I'd post a pic if I had one...
5,One of the best rappers.,Will is funny and a great actor. He sings really good songs and I like them. WILD WILD WEST.
2,Not at all like Gideon Oliver!,"I have read all of Aaron Elkin's Gideon Oliver series, and this is nothing like them at all. The character development is minimal and the forensics are ridiculously gory. This is definitely NOT a book you want to be reading while you're eating your lunch. It's much more comparable to the television series ""Bones,"" but with more gruesome details.I bought the second book in the series hoping it would get better, but so far, it isn't."
2,Not all that,"A reviewer on the paperback (Booklist, in a starred review) compared this to the best of Patricia Cornwell. No comparison. Cornwell is graphic, and her habit of having criminals stalk her characters instead of the other way around can be wearing, but her scientific jargon (while keeping the jist available to the reader) is of a much higher quality than this. The obvious leads to a further plot development in this book (dropped in casual conversation, and ignored at the time by the characters involved) are unlikely. Dialogue is stilted. Good scientific skills and their basis are articulated, and interesting basic forensic skills, both criminal and anthropological, are introduced. It's a good start."
1,hunk-a-junk,"This seat cover is just four months old, has very little use and is already splitting apart in several places. Then again, what did I expect for [...], at least a year or two of use."
4,A must for anyone interested in the 34th NC Infantry Regt.,"The edited and annotated Civil War correspondence of Lts. Cotton and Huntley, 34th NC Infantry Regt., Pender/Scales Brigade of the Light Division.Provides rare insight into the every day lives of these Confederate patriots who both fell in support of their believes; Huntley at Gettysburg and Cotton at the Jerusalem Plank Road"
5,SUPER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"After reading Leaves of Grass, Mobey-Dick, Walden, and Emerson's essays and letting them burn on my heart for ten years, I read THE LIST BY ROBERT E. BELKNAP and it altered my perspective on these previously read books. This book is amazing and is by far the best I have ever read! It is extremely beneficial to adding to your IQ. Happy reading! :)"
1,"Pretty much like thin, cheap nylon","These are nothing like silk. They are so thin that they are practically transparent and they feel very much like cheap nylon. With a single digit price they might, maybe be usefull as an alternative to the lowest grade polyester."
4,Very attractive fan,"The problem I have with most fans is that they are ugly. I don't mind that in some places but I wanted a fan that looked nice in my livingroom and did not stand out too much. Well this is the one! It has a nice base that looks like a piece of furniture and the fan itself is even a matching brown. As for the way it works I would rate it as good for it's size - which at 12"" is fairly modest. But it does come in a larger floor model and if I decide in the future I must have a larger one, I will likely buy it as well."
2,Where is the Magnificance?,"It's OK to have a low budget, and to try to make something worthwhile out of it, within your alloted humble scope. Unfortunately, scrimping on a director was not a good decision in this undertaking. They needed an old pro who knows how to work fast and get decent shots that flow, have meaning, allow the actors to present a character etc. Inept staging of scenes leave the cast floundering over and over. Statues standing and saying lines, over and over. Many look grim in their scenes simply because they know the captain of the ship doesn't know what he is doing...and this film will be a mess. There is a good cast, and the skeleton of a good story...but a good recipe does not make a good cook."
3,Enjoyable,"As someone with no formal (or even much informal) economics background, I found this book to be a reasonable synopsis of what's been happening over the last 40 years. I liked the broad coverage, and the little anecdotes told along the way kept it interesting. At the same time, it did get a bit repetitive, and the authors' opinions about the strength of the Asian economies were a little hard to believe given the current circumstances."
3,"The second book, Starfinder, was better.",I really tried to like the hero throughout the book but found myself having a hard time liking some of his decisions. The female was just okay. I got tired of reading how she wanted to dislike the guy and was fighting that feeling through out the book. It got boring. BUT I think the book before this one was excellent. I was so caught up with the characters. Which made buy this one.
4,Who killed BrianJones,"Interesting book and theory on who killed the Stones founding member. After reading this book I was convinced there was more to Jones' death than an accidental swimming accident. The book flows nicely and leaves one quite sad to see the effect greed, fame and fortune can have on some people."
3,You don't need to own this film,"This is an unpleasant little film, with enough quirky elements to make it interesting enough to watch once (i.e., rent it), but you certainly don't need to own it. The fight sequences are bloody, but uninspired otherwise. Meatloaf is pretty interesting as the bodybuilder who has grown ""[breasts]"" as a result of testicular cancer. The ultimate semi-surprise ending is sort of interesting, but can't make it up to you for sitting through an otherwise over-long and dreary film. The ""romantic"" interaction between Pitt and the female lead is simply vile. Bottom line. Don't buy it."
1,An objective review,"When it comes to films, I am pretty open minded. But having had to sit through a disturbing two hours of this film, I have to say that it is terrible. It started ok, as the one redeeming feature (Norton's acting)was pulling it thorugh. However with the introduction of the ever wooden Pitt (why won't directors sacrifice popularity for talent?)it took a decidided down turn. The writer of this anti-consumerism tosh is obviously so pleased with himself, so smug, that he has tried to produce something which he expects us all to stand back and say ""wow"". Quite frankly by the end I was bored, extremely dissapointed and felt cheated of my 2."
1,am i the only person alive that hated this movie,"I am a huge Edward Norton fan so of course when this movie cameout I rushed to see it. That was the biggest mistake ever. It wasjust too weird for me. I usually like movies with unsuprising endings but this went too far. The acting was great but the story was lacking. Lastly, THIS IS THE MOST OVERRATED MOVIE OF ALL TIME!"
4,Under the incredible violence,"Under the incredible violence is a well acted, directed, and very thought-provoking entertaining movie. Edward Norton and Brad Pitt are surprisingly good in lead roles. Great ending."
5,Breaking Rules 1 and 2,"The book-to-movie translation of this title is by far the best rendition I have ever seen. Maybe besides the Harry Potter series, but even in those movies scenes from the books were left out.Fight Club is really a piece of art, and the actors and directors did a great job."
4,Brad Pitt Rules,"Wow... If that word can sum it up, then so be it. The sound and visual effects were great. Brad Pitt is the best when it comes to brain twisted movies.However, From the feedback I got from most female friends, I think I can say that Fight Club is a guys movie.."
5,One of the best I've seen,"How did this movie not even get NOMINATED for any awards besides MTV's best fight? Come on, this was better then any movie made in 1999, except American Beauty. Brad Pitt was amazing. His work as Tyler just kept me interested in what he was doing throughout the whole movie. Edward Norton also kept me laughing as eveything he did seemed to be so heart-breaking and funny at the same time.Fight Club was one of the best movies I have ever rented and once this thing stops costing 106 dollars, I WILL buy it."
3,Tyler Burden Delivers,"Now I bought this for the movie great as always, but I would have loved for it to have some extra content being the 10th anniversary edition.How about some interviews from say the director or the cast after 10 years. What they think of the movie after all these years and how it's affected them and their careers. Stuff like that.**Spoiler (Kinda)**That menu trick at the beginning was good for a laugh the first time around, but it gets annoying because I have to wait through it to start the movie."
2,"Great DVD Package, OK Movie","I wanted to like this movie so much. I really did. I caught onto the plot twist early on, and had no problem with it. The acting and the direction were good, I just felt the story itself was just ok. I dont want to give too much away, but in the end the movie was just ok.The DVD package is awesome. The extra stuff is great. But the movie is not. Three Kings was a Great Movie with a great DVD package. Fight Club is a Ok movie with a great disc full of extra stuff.I say rent it, don't buy it."
2,Save the money,"I have no complaints about the translation to DVD, but this movie had so much potential that it just blew. It's the first movie that I've ever seen where for the first half, I was blown away and completely drawn in, but by the end, I wanted my money back. They blew that bad. It had some many things that it could have dealt with, but instead, it relied on a ridiculous plot twist that ruined the film. Save your dough."
3,reviewer's dilemma,"Hmmm...This is an excellently acted, directed and produced film. Based on a creepy self-loathing script replete with scato-physical and scato-sexual fantasies. It would seem that the writer is exorcising his geeky ghosts at the expense of the viewing (and paying) public. The pseudo-anarchism seems like a cry for help. Can one appreciate great acting based on a bombastic self-indulgent script? There, right there, is the reviewer's dilemma."
1,"phenomenal movie, but...","edward norton is in it. and so is brad pit. and little shots of penises here and there. i mean COME ON! soap made of fat? a secret ""fight club?""i've heard that this was a book before this was a movie - which is good, cause i don't want to read ANY book that's as bad as this movie was."
5,As good as the book,"Fight Club is an amazing piece of work. I typically have pretty low expectations of films adapted from books. A film has so much less time to tell the story and most novels tend to be pretty interior (making them hard to put on film). The book is very much like an Elmore Leonard novel; it's short, with lots of action and dialog. The translation to film is amazing. You get all the great stuff from the book, ENHANCED by the excellent visuals and performances. The scenes added or changed from the book (like the scene where the main characters first meet) are just as strong as the book.There is some violence in the film, but I didn't find it unsettling at all (there are no victims, per se, making the voilence come across more like ""extreme sports"").This is an excellent movie. If you like the book, definitely see the movie. If you like the movie, read the book."
5,Does God know your name???,"If you're 27-40 he probably doesn't. You're not part of the ""Baby boom"" or the ""X"" generation - you're nowhere! So am I! Almost every kid I grew up with grew up wihout a dad around full time and those of us who have a dad around never saw him. Are we real men? What is a real man? Does anyone care anymore? Previous generations have destroyed this planet and now we are left here to live in it. Are we gonna sell out just like the hippies did or are we going to try and make a difference when it's our turn to run things?Do you feel this way? If you answered yes - this movie is for you. One of the greatest films I've ever seen. If you get off on seeing guys beat each other up, you love old Arnold, Sly and Bruce Willis movies, if you spend your entire day on Sunday in front of the TV watching football - this movie is above your head - you might like it, but you won't get it! Do yourself a favor and watch DIE HARD 8 again."
5,A Guy Movie and so much more.,"This gets labelled as a guy movie all the time. It's definitely one that's aimed toward guys but it's a sophisticated and well put together movie that I feel anyone could enjoy. There's points in the movie that may be too 'touchy' for females but the story well then makes up for it.I'm not going to go into detail about the movie seeing as the number of review before mine that have, but I will go into detail about the DVD features.David Fincher knows how to put out DVDs, this, as well asSeven (New Line Platinum Series), feature no less than 4 commentaries. Also included are plenty of feautettes, deleted scenes, and behind-the-scenes footage. The case is awesome just as well. This is a must have. It very well may be the best movie David Fincher ever directed.Must Have."
4,Really Really Really Different (Out there) but good.,"Don't get up for a refill..you may lose track of what's going on..but this is truly a good movie. I am getting more and more impressed my the ""different"" movies that are making it to the big screen....Finally! Something different!"
5,THE Rolls Royce of Movies,"I labeled this THE BEST MOVIE EVER(!!!!!!!) from the first time I watched it (the year it came out) UP UNTIL NOW IN 2003.ANYONE WHO *DOESN'T* LIKE FIGHT CLUB JUST DIDN'T UNDERSTAND IT. They need a clue!!!For anyone with a brain will find this gem MINDBLOWING. The BEST MOVIE IN THE WORLD and has it all. GREAT Acting, MIND BLOWING Story, Funny, and Cuts the b.s. like knife through swiss cheese."
4,I like this movie,I am a bid Ed Norton fan and Brad Pitt doesn't get in the way...and his character is pretty cool too. Perfect partner for Ed's character.
3,??,"If you're in the mood for senseless violence, colorful characters, and a twisted end, I suppose it all adds up. As always, both Edward Norton and Brad Pitt pulled great performances, but I question why they chose to do the film as its lasting value is very slight."
5,One of the Best over-looked films of 1999,"I walked into the theater expecting to hate this movie...but walked out thoroughly amazed. This is one of the most under-rated brilliant films I've seen in a long time. The directing and editing style is top notch that keeps pace with the interesting characters and ever-developing plotline. -- People hated this movie, yet LOVED the ""Sixth Sense."" I don't get it. -- ""Fight Club"" is a wonderful satire in the age of ""Men are from Mars."" Over-the-top violence seems to be consistantly misunderstood (see: ""Natural Born Killers"" as an example) and it appears to have happened again here. A great story, snappy dialogue...plus, Edward Norton continues to demonstrate himself to be one of the greatest actors of his generation...This movie is a must-see for anyone who loves movies. I can't wait to get the DVD so my friends and I can end the raging debate about all the flash frames in the beginning 20 minutes of the film."
5,"My teen-ager insisted I watch this, and he was right","I blew this movie off when it first appeared, mis-construing it as a down and dirty fight movie with dubious redeeming qualities. I was wrong.This week my teen-ager, who does NOT watch many DVDs, told me I had to see it, so I picked up a copy at Best Buy and by gosh and by golly, this is a philosophy movie, not a fight movie.Yes, there are a few scenes with blood all over, but if anything, once comes away feeling, as the director intends, that fighting is life-affirming.This is a movie for intelligent people who have some angst about the way things are going under the mismanagement of the ""business as usual"" political parties, and for those who question the ""gerbil on a wheel"" existence that most jobs offer.I found it completely absorbing and very worthwhile."
2,Fight Club - dies fighting,"This is a movie (as somebody said) that you will either love or hate. I, for one, didn't like (won't say hate) the movie much. I still think Fincher made an awesome movie in Seven, however Fight Club doesn't even close. It's about mindless fighting (so what if a bored idiot wants to vent out his anger by swinging fists) Very little acting required on part of actors. All they do is deliver witty (but uninspiring) dialogues. The background commentary gets annoying after some time. The movie is devoid of plot. Watch this movie only to learn that it's your own sh#t that you use to wash your face. Waste of money!"
3,I'll Attend The Night Clubs Rather,"Well I saw this with my boyfriend like a year ago and I just did not see what the big deal was. A lot of people like this movie. Aside from the eye candy (Norton and Pitt), I don't think it's a movie I could watch again. I know there was some symbolism in the movie, but I couldn't really follow. No doubt though that the acting was really good. I would have to say the way the story unfolded was interesting and it drew me in for a little bit. There were the fight scenes where you can witness lots of bleeding and punching. It has its humor, it has it's dark appealingness to it...it sounds good, but I guess I just wasn't interested. It is not your average movie and it is rather unusual. Maybe I'll try it again another time. I'd say watch it because I'm just one of the few who didn't get as much as we expected from it."
4,"Excellent movie, but beware the message","I found Fight Club to be an excellent movie, as the title of my review suggests. Although ultraviolent, this movie is also well crafted with spot on direction. It's also a visually stunning movie with cleverly interweaved effects. This aspect of the movie is too often ignored. I should say however that I was a little disturbed by the overall message. I happen to like Ikea furniture with its always fashionable Scandinavian design."
5,Mind blowingly good!,"This has to be the biggest surprise smash of '99. From the amazing brain-ride rollercoaster intro, throught to the explosive final sequence, this delievers on every level an then some! Pitt and Norton are both on top form as is Bonham Carter. The film's twist at the end beats the hell out of The Sixth Sense's! My new personal favourite: over taking Terminator 2!!!"
5,THE BEST,"""In the world I see, you're stalking elk through the damp canyon forest, around the ruins of Rockefeller Center. You'll wear leather clothes that will last you the rest of your life. You'll climb the wrist-think kudzu vines that wrap the Sears Tower. And when you look down, you'll see tiny figures pounding corn laying strips of venison on the empty carpool lane of some abandoned superhighway"" - TylerThis movie is classic!!! The BEST movie ever!"
1,Very disappointing,"I think the writer had very good intentions. However, there is just not much here. A causal vistor to France already knows everything that is in this book."
1,This Author & Book is Awful,"Whatever you do - DO NOT READ ANYTHING THIS AUTHOR HAS WRITTEN NOR WORK WITH THIS AUTHOR.June Rives also owns a company that helps Americans relocate to America. Do NOT use her. She is difficult to work with, she says one thing before you contract with her and then goes back on her word, and in the end - she doesn't find you the perfect French apartment. You are much better off going to Paris/France, getting a hostel for 2-3 nights, and then finding a Craigslist deal. Her book was written back in the 80's ... and that's where it should stay."
4,Please re-release this movie,I saw this movie as a 13-year-old when it first came out - only once - and I still remember specific moments from it! I would love to share this movie with others who have never seen it - it's a wonderful example that teenage love does not have to be about sex. Please re-release it!!!
4,"A ""growing-up"" movie I'd really love to own!",Several friends and I are searching for this movie and would love to see it re-released. I see from the other reviews that we are not alone. It's one of my adolescent favorites... that Rex Smith was something else! : )
2,Harry Warren Uplifted,"While I am not a great duo fan, and recommend MF get back to those lushly orchestrated back-ups, these tunes are uplifted as good as I have ever heard them.My only gripe is that sometimes, MF gets a little too slow for my tastes. He can be like a Shirley Horn of a different gender, so I found this album drags too much. It's like listening to a doctoral dissertation of Buxtehude.Finally, I am an old Shearing Quintet lover, and boy would that have made this a gem. Shearing has not won me over as a paino player like say Brubeck or Evans, but with the quintet setting he is an icon nonetheless."
3,Is Michael Feinstein trying to sound like Mel Torme?,"As an avid fan of Michael's for many years this CD came as a shock. Either his ""Pitch"" was much lower, as if he was trying to sound like Mel Torme, or perhaps he had a touch of laryngitis, which gave him a huskyness so reminiscent of the late ""Velvet Fog."" Either way the CD didn't quite cut it for me. George Shearing was his own impeccable self offering a wonderful accompaniment for Michael with these great Harry Warren ""Gems."" Perhaps, a change in tempo would have helped to break the monontony of this selection of tunes too."
2,Dented !,"I was so excited to buy this as a christmas gift. I thought after Hurricane Sandy when we couldn't get gas so easily this made a great gift. I read reviews and a couple people said there's came dented. I figured whats the chance that could happen again, it was probably a fluke. Nope mind came dented also. It was a gift the person i gave it to said it was fine. What a disappointment..."
5,"Finally, a quality gas can","It had been a while since I bought a gas can so I was in for a rude awakening. Thanks you Big Brother Government for once again messing with my life! The new ""safe"" cans are anything but. No vent so they pour slowly meaning you get tired holding it and sometimes slip and spill. The lack of vent also means they sometimes explode with the buildup of pressure when they get warm in the summer heat. Whoever invented the safety switches must be an alien with 3 hands! This can is GREAT. A nice long flexible METAL spout that doesn't require a funnel. An easy to hold release and a vent that opens when you pull the release AND releases pressure buildup. Plus it's made of heavy gauge metal. Yeah, it's expensive but now every time I use it I remember the junk they sell in the home stores and smile."
5,Built like a brick ....,I ordered three of these. They all arrived fine. No dents or any trouble at all.This is a solid gas can. I needed to replace a few old plastic ones which I have just put up with for a long time. These have a bullet proof look and feel to them. The spout points down like in the picture so you can insert it into the tank/container you are filling before to start to tilt and pour. That's way better then the typical plastic can that has a spout pointing up.I wanted a tough well built can and I am very pleased.I would definitely buy again and recommend to a friend.
4,EAGLE 5 GAL CAN,"ARRIVED WITH DENT IN CAN BUT THERE WAS NOTHING WRONG WITH THE BOX,BOTTOM COULD BE THICKER,PAINT PEELING OFF AFTER A FEW MONTHS BUT OVERALL A NICE CAN. IT ONLY TAKES A FEW MINUTES TO POUR INTO A CAR,NOT A HALF HOUR LIKE THOSE OBAMA CANS!!"
4,"Solid, leak proof American made product","Based on the many reviews on this can I figured that I would get a quality product with a dent in the top that was really hard to operate! Well, while I had no dent, it absolutely does not leak and has a positive smooth flow of fuel when you pull the flow handle back. Yes, it is stiff and if you are pretty weak in the arms and/or hands it is not as easy as one of the cheap plastic ones with two handles on them to pour.However, this is the highest quality gas can I have ever had and it does exactly what it says....It pours with a smooth no splatter flow and it does not leak. If it had a second pour handle on the edge of the can to help hold a full can while pouring I'd give it 5 stars and it would be perfect."
2,Funny book,"Not so much the content, but the author. A decade or two ago he invented a couple important features of the internet, and based on that success he's now the Three Wise Men rolled into one. That cocksure American attitude similar in tone to our eight-year nightmare George Bush, or that we hear again today in Sarah Palin. Everything is settled for this guy. He's knows what's worthy and what's not. He knows right from wrong. His occasional reverence is fake; only his self-regard is real. He never mentions that he might have merely right-timed, right-placed into his pile of money, but instead presents it as the inevitable result of him unconquerable will and boundless intellect. Buy this book if your dream is to become a zillionaire from tapping at a keyboard. But I'll warn you the ""Big Ideas"" don't show up in the first half. Don't know about the second."
4,Sid Vicious & Friends - LIVE 1978!,"There is such a small amount of material out there by Sid Vicious, and this album is just great. From tracks 1 to 8, you will find a Sid Vicious gig at the Electric Camden Ballroom in London, late 1978. Then. Track 9 is from a gig in Maxs Kansas City in New York. Track 10 is ""My Way"", in the studio version of ""The Great Rock and Roll Swindle"", just a bit shorter. ""Pretty Vacant"" comes from a Sex Pistols gig, around 1977. ""Submission"" is a slow,psychodelic remix from the nineties, as well as ""Anarchy in the U.K."", in which is transformed into a dance track. The album is really good and the audio quality is great too."
4,Lanscape design in Callifornia for dummies,I borrowed this book from the library first to see if it was any good. I liked it so much I bought it. If you are designing your home gardens from scratch this book is a must have. It helps you design and select plants for around your home. Selecting plants is a snap. I recently moved into a house which needed landscaping and I am using this book to design my backyard space. Well written and concise with plans that are easily translated to your space.This book is not good for looking prants up to see if a particular plant would work in a specfic light situation. Its not an almanac.
4,"Good Resource, Could be Even Better","This was a good resource and it was helpful in giving me ideas for plantings in my garden. I like the idea of showing the different takes of landscaping designers for a particular problem. It was very comprehensive with info on plant care and pruning, and even covered how to make patios, flagstone walkways, and terraced planters.Although the close-up photos were helpful, I wish the painted mock-ups of the various designers' ideas was more detailed (some of the flowering plants illustrated with no flowers, etc.) so I could get a better idea of how the overall design would look. Also, the listing of plants in the back is ordered by their scientific names (come on! this is intended for the average consumer, isn't it?) rather than by their popular names, so that part was difficult to use as a reference.Despite my reservations, the information is fairly easy to access and I found myself referring to this often as I designed and worked on my garden."
1,No More Please,"Dull, bland and too long - that's how I would describe this book. I have a hard time imaging that even the people in this law firm were interested in this book. It billed itself as the behind the scenes view of one of the most powerful law firms in Wall Street and the scandals that brought it down - a legal Den of Thief's. Sorry, this description should almost be considered fraud. How could so much bad writing fall into one book? My only assumption is that the publisher must be related to the author and this is a favor or wedding present. Stay away from this book like you would a messy divorce."
5,Excellent Resource for all woman!,"This really is a great book. I learned so much from this book! Yes, it's gendered biased but that's what it's supposed to be. It's about woman. It's about woman at all stages of life, and a view from all walks of life."
4,Great read!,"After having read a half dozen Cussler books, his now familier writing style is addicting. It is a compelling blend of intrigue and softened reality that makes for easy reading in airports, and on the road. Never drippy, and never too harsh. You will probably like it."
3,Three and one half stars,"Cussler is a great storyteller, he does enough research to make it interesting, and I like the political intrigue portions of his stories. The only time I roll my eyes while reading Cussler is when Dirk Pitt does something like ask three different women to dinner in the span of a few minutes or so, while a life and death crisis is unfolding around them. That's just a little too silly for me."
4,ANOTHER GREAT BOOK BY CLIVE CUSSLER,"Without a doubt this book was great... all the way through, Clive Cussler is truly a magician with words and I have never read a book quite as exiciting as this... overall a great book to read... order now!"
4,Cussler Comes Thru,"Clive has certainly come thru this time. Though some of his novels can be pedantic and repetitive, this seems to have a fair amount of originality while also having enough maturity in his writing. A good, fun adventure."
1,"Bad premise, bad writing!","How does this man continue to sell books? I was given this book by a friend of mine who was amazed that I had never heard of the great Dirk Pit. After reading the book I, in turn, was amazed that an adult could read this stuff and actually admit that he/she liked it. If this is the type of 'literature' that people are buying, then I'm happy to say that I am no longer in the mainstream of best-seller buyers (although I don't recall Clive Cussler's name being associated with any so-called Best-Seller lists)"
2,"Blah, blah, blah....","My father reccommended this book to me...that should have been my first clue. I will give Mr. Cussler credit for the story's premise and the little effort put into research. However, I could not suppress my urge to regurgitate at the absurdity of Dirk Pitt...the infallible, the delectible, the inscrutible...the ridiculous! I think Clive Cussler is better suited to writing comic books for the prepubescent. Gag."
5,Awesome,This rack is great! Perfect for roasting anything that will fit on it. Clean-up was a snap in the dishwasher!
4,Its a little short but my son loves it!,"My son loves this book, it is a little short but, who wants to read a 50page book in the bathroom? By the time we have finished reading this one, he has gone potty. He loves flushing the potty on the book and then when he is done on the potty he loves to ""flush flush flush"" the toilet. And wash his hands. It straight to the point with great pictures and a noise making thing that all toddlers love dont they? This is my sons favorite book. He is 23months, not only that but, because he is so used to the sound the book makes he is not afraid of the real flushing."
3,"Good book, but....","The book in itself was great, but the toilet button ended up going out only after a couple flushes. My son loved it till it quit flushing and now he won't even look at it. I still believe it is a good book for toilet training."
4,"Excellent book, unhelpful Kindle formating","This novel is very interesting and well written. Unfortunately, the Kindle formatting is not very good; the font is oddly formatted and there is not a good navigation system."
3,PIXMA ip1600 photo printer,"When using black ink only, it pauses and asks every time I select it, which is irritating. Color photos don't print the greatest qualitly either. We are using in an office setting and for black the quality is good."
3,Free was a good price,"I got this as part of a package deal, and assuming the $50 rebate comes through, the price is right. Free. We'll be using it in a low-demand, non-critical application so I can't complain. But big print jobs will come to my Canon iP 4000, which is a Lexus compared to this stripped Toyota Echo. If you're looking for a serious printer, go up the Canon line or go elsewhere."
5,"Pixma iP1600: Great Printer, No Regrets","I went to Best Buy with 50 bucks looking for an inexpensive printer to work with my ThinkPad. At first I was a bit skeptical because of the printer being at such a low price, but when I got it home and set it up, (uber-easy setup), it worked like a charm. Almost 10 times faster than my $150 Epson CX4600 All-In-One. A month later, I set it up on my network with a Netgear PS121 print server, and it works amazingly! Buying both color and black cartridges (genuine Canon) is cheaper than buying ONE HP color cartridge. Canon print-to-web software is great!Pros:Super-fast, inexpensive, cheap ink, easy setup, software easy to use.Cons: Somewhat noisy (remember: $50), no paper output tray.Bottom Line: Great printer for schools, offices, homes, or anyone looking for a fast, cost-effective printer for general (including photos) uses."
4,Great value,"This printer is great for the price. I bought it to be able to print clear color pictures. It takes up more room under my computer because the paper feeds from the top, and there's no tray to catch the completed print, but I am happy with the ease of use and quality of print."
4,Alert In The West,"Good book,I happen to have both ""old"" ""I fought You from the Skies "" and this new edition. New is better as this book reveals true names of Luftwaffe pilots - maybe the old version is from the time when Luftwaffe histories weren't so popular.Good book in all - ""langnase"" is described very well and even Walter Nowotny gives appearance. Also added pictures give some faces to characters of the final battles in Europe.Recommend warmly...Juha Luukka"
3,Exp Date: Oct 2013,"This great tea gets 3 stars because of the exp.date of Oct 2013 (I received it on Oct 4, 2012) and being sold at regular price. The tea appears to be fresh but I will keep it in a glass jar and in the frig. I suggest that you keep unopened packages in the frig also. Gunpowder and Oolong are my favorites.I have used this brand of gunpowder for many years. It has always been fresh and makes a wonderful cup of tea. I prefer it as is - no sweeteners or flavors. Maybe a slice of lemon occasionally. Not as delicate as regular green tea but has a noticable kick. It must be steeped properly to enjoy its goodness."
5,Useful but only as an intro,"My advice is buy the entire, wonderful book rather than this synopsis, but if you only have a minute and a passing regard for the biotech revolution, then this is a good introduction. Juan Enriquez is one of the most fascinating thinkers of our time, and his beautifully designed and eye-opening book is brilliant, but if you want something ""quick and dirty"" then this little download fits the bill. I'll bet you'll want the full course, however. It's really amazing and powerful stuff."
2,Two amateurs write history of sea warfare,"I, unfortunately, bought the book. It is written by two amateurs, who know very little about geography, or warfare at sea. They are ""politically correct"" in an archaic way (ca. 1941) in praising the ""British race"" and making essentially stick figures out of the ""wicked Nazi"". But, when you are PC, I guess you don't need to know the difference between latitude and longitude, or the First Lord of the Admiralty, and the First Sea Lord (page 109). Page 109 is practically a Keystone Cops scene in confusing who was what.Although they did the research, their amateurish confusion invalidates the book as a serious historical account.Not recommended at all unless they do a re-write of the amateurish passages. Not recommended as a book on naval history, unless the propagande is taken out."
2,The Destruction of the BISMARCK,"This book is disappointing. It has factual errors and tries to interjecta ""subplot,"" as it were, of considerable American involvement in the BISMARCK operation. An American officer was flying a patrol plane that spotted BISMARCK, and the American Coast Guard cutter MODOC encounteredBISMARCK and pursuing British ships.Some ""American involvement,"" huh?Let me sum up: If you know nothing at all about the BISMARCK operation, there's only two books you need to read: Battleship BISMARCK: A Survivor's Story by Mullenheim-Rechberg, and Pursuit: The Chase and Sinking of the Battleship BISMARCK by Ludovic Kennedy."
4,"Yes, Thank You Very Much","Okay, if you're a fan of the 90210 (or whatever it was called) period of Yes, you can just click on to another page. The Backstreet Boys are probably going to be more to your liking than this incredible set of music. For those of us who like their prog with a huge dose of noise, this fits the bill nicely. You can certainly see the influence of The Nice on Yes. As great as Close To The Edge and Fragile were, this is the Yes album I grab to listen to these days. The performances on this CD are so dynamic and energetic, that they serve to point out what a bloated mess Yessongs was. This is in-your-face Yes, not the more friendly band that came later."
3,"Cute, but cheap looking","I wish that I liked the valances as much as I liked the comforter set. I don't. The seams aren't sewn well and there were three inches of thread that weren't knotted hanging off on either side. I cut the first ones off not realizing that they weren't tied. It's simple enough to fix the seam, but the quality just isn't there. They do look cute once they're hung up, but the fabric and workmanship indicate that these valances should be priced much lower."
2,Combat Mission: Shock Force has room for improvement,Overall a decent game with great graphics HOWEVER-I found controlling units difficult compared to games like Rome Total War (e.g. no option to set a formation)-crashed several times (though I didn't download the patches yet).This game played much better with a mouse than on my laptops touchpad.
3,If you do not have Windows XP or 2000 be very aware!,This is a good produce except for a few things. The battery life on both the camera and the external hard drive is very poor. The software that comes with the camera can only work on Windows XP or 2000... sorry Mac or Vista users. However Panasonic does have an application that can work on Windows Vista but it is in Japanese's. If you do run Finial Cut Studio 2 in your Mac you can import it in to your timeline. I have not got it to work with Adobe or Avid editing programs. The audio is quite good give the nature of the camera. Unless you need a small 3 CCD camera that stores on a memory card I would suggest you consider something a little cheaper... maybe a Sony HDV cam? Hope this helps!
3,"excellent documentary,but hard to understand sometimes","this is a good way to get the gist that is hong kong cinema,with the women doing stunts,kung fu with the best of any actor in that genre.Some of it was hard to understand(the interviews)but I enjoyed it nonetheless. I give it 3 stars"
5,My picky indulged small dogs LOVE this compassionate kibble,"Frankly I never thought I'd buy a vegetarian dog food, even though I personally have given up meat and chicken and rarely eat any type of seafood anymore. However my Yorkshire terrier and rescued Dwarf Australian Cattle Dog needed to lose a bit of weight (don't we all) and I decided this would be an easy and compassionate way to cut back on calories and decrease the violence in our personal food consumption at our house. The dogs love it! I'm buying the big bag this time."
1,I no longer consider Natural Balance a safe pet food,I threw out the Natural Balance dog food I had on hand (both the vegetarian and bison/sweet potato formulas)and won't be buying any more after reading complaints on ConsumerAffairs.com website regarding pets that died after eating tainted Natural Balance. A very disturbing aspect is that the company did not recall any of their pet food or even admit the problem even though they were notified multiple pets died or became very ill (with similar symptoms) quite suddenly and soon after eating the product. No more Natural Balance for my dog.
3,novel remakes from an up & coming star,"Who knew at the time Reginal Kenneth Dwight recorded these pop tunes written by other artists that he would eventually be the superstar that he is today. The sound is slightly raw and his voice still developing, but the style and arrangements are uniquely Elton John. This is probably not a CD for the casual Elton John listener but a must for the enthusiast (such as myself)who can appreciate the artist for his musical energy and creative interpretations that were and still are the backbone of his successful career."
5,"Hey Simon, Where you Going With that Cross in Your Hand?,","Bunuel is a master of attack in his assault on everything sacred in this quirky short that resembles a true religious tenet that would be found in some religious scripture. It concerns Simon who is a buffoonish and sanctimonious man who sits atop his ""column"" out in the desert. If anything, we gain more anger towards Simon because of his immutable methods of ""holier than thou attitude"". He is nothing but an anachronism that is unwilling to change. The guise of the devil comes along in many forms attempting to indulge Simon in his own corruption. The film suddenly ends on a strange note in reference to the future as Simon seems to have been won out by Lucifer in one of the most whimsical features of Bunuel's long career."
5,Javier the best,I have been listening to Javier Solis since I was a little girl back home in Belize in Central America. Javier Solis takes you into another world where music is music and you feel all warm and you love life at that specific moment that he is singing. The music by the mariachis is just overwhelming and you want to listen to it over and over. I just love TU VOZ and i can't see it on the internet. I think it must be on his first album. I wish the world would listen to this music as it is brilliant!...
5,This One Is A Knockout,"I can't tell you how happy we were to find this album on Amazon, we had come across a couple of the tracks on one of those big band compilations and had been looking for it ever since and hoping it even existed! Lionel and the band are obviously having a great time and are really cooking especially on the 'Flying Home' track which is by far the best version he ever recorded. Don't miss this one, you won't be disappointed."
5,One Of The BEst Books I Ever Read,"I read this book when I was in school and have always remebered it. I lost my copy of the book and have always wanted another one. I was so happy when I found a copy on amazon. This is just one of those stories that you never forget. I am now 31 years old and can't wait to read it again. I HIGHLY Recommend this book !!! Also, check out the sequel which I just found out about, it's called ""Learning To Love Again""."
4,A Bittersweet Teenage Romance,"What Paul and Mariah had may have lasted if Paul did not get sick. What a tragic ending. This is one of the first books I have read when I was 13. The dialogue and pacing is ok. Some parts were funny, too. (maybe to balance off the tragic ending) Touching and sweet.I'm sorry though that I lent it to someone and was not able to get it back."
4,I still remember this book,"At a time when all a read were teen romances I read this as well. I'm almost 40 years old and have read many books and have moved well past romances as my choice of books to read. I don't remember really any of the books I read at that time except this one. I loved this book for a long time. I have it in one of my boxes of childhood memories. It has been many years since I read the book and I couldn't say exactly why, but the book moved me and stayed with me. Looking at the other reviews I'm relieved to see that I wasn't the only one that it has stuck with."
5,Helping the Lost amongst us....,"Probably the most rewarding work that such advanced souls as Mary Summer Rain could possibly do....helping Lost Souls (?Ghosts?) go ""towards the light"", home, away from the suffering they have endured here on Earth, into the arms of Our Mother and Father....."
2,She's no Celia!,"This CD is on full throttle the whole time---which is fine if you're in a hurry to buy tostones. Put another way, India is no Celia C. She has little nuance, just an overly brash, full and jarring sound. She could turn a lullaby into a weapon. So, beware..."
4,Great Movie with Great Music,"I haven't actually listened to the soundtrack. However I do own the movie and the music is beatiful. If you don't like instrumental music then this is not for you. I do not really like the song where Cornelious sings Please Wake Up, but that is just because I prefer instruments over singing. All in all you should get this cd... if not you should at least buy the movie. It is a great childrens movie about a group of furlings (young animals) that must journey to another meadow to find herbs that will save their friends life(a truck carrying poison gas ran off the road and poisoned their meadow and friend). I put this movie in for my friend's four year old sister and she could not tear her eyes away from it until it was over."
3,"Just OK, not special","The chocolate is pretty tasty, but the alcohol filling is not very strong. My main complaint is how difficult it is to unwrap them. The foil tears up into pieces and I end up with chocolate and the filling all over my fingers. They look impressive in the wrapping, but I did not enjoy eating them so I would not buy again."
1,Truly bad product.,"I was hoping for actual liquor filled chocolates, but instead ended up with these, which are the most atrocious, jelly filled, sticky, and simply impossible to open without creating a mess chocolates I have ever tasted. Altogether, in the whole box, the total amount of alcohol may be as high as 10 drops."
2,Not impressed,"I was very disappointed with the quality of the chocolate.If you want the BEST, I've found that Ethel M.'s chocolate liquor barrels are incredibly good - but you WILL pay the price!"
2,seemed old,"You know how the chocolate turns light brown when it gets old? That's how these were at the top. They were that lighter shade of brown as if they were old. That part just didn't taste right, but the liquor inside was good. These candies weren't fresh."
1,A non-edited scan?,This kindle edition has so many typos and errors where parts of the text are misplaced that if has the feel of a totally unedited scan. I do not believe that it has been proofed at all.If it had been one of the free books available I would have forgiven these many errors but there is no way that I should have been charged for it!
1,The hardback of the Making,"Buyers beware of the hardback version of E. P Thompson's classic work ""The Making of the English Working Class"". Firstly, note that the hardback is a 1966 edition. This means that is does not have Thompson's 1968 postscript, nor his 1980 preface (it probably also misses the author's 1968 revisions, but I have not checked this). Secondly, this is not an organically produced hardback: the picture on the cover is glued on, and the spine does not have the author's name (instead, it has the name ""Peter Smith"" - so who the hell is Peter Smith?). All in all, a shocker for purists, or any serious scholar, made all the worse for the magnificence of the original."
4,The Leonard Nimoy segment,"Nimoy comes to Charlie Rose with an autobiographical volume called ""I am Spock"". He had previously written volume called,""I am not Spock"". Spock was the fictional character Nimoy played on the television space- epic 'Star-Trek'. He speaks about his role, his relationship with co- star William Shatner, his belief that there is an extraterrestial life, a novel he is writing about an extra- terrestial who comes to study human society, his own gratitude that he has been able to make a career in acting.This is a low - key conversation with a modest professional whose success apparently has not gone to his head."
1,Ordered and never received,I ordered this book a month ago ...I was told it had been sent... It's been a month and I haven't received it!
4,A good start for the young sonero....,"Michael Stuart...when you hear the name, you wouldn't think that he would be a Salsero. However, do not let the name fool you. Michael did a great job for his first album. And having listen to ""Cuentos de la..."" and ""Subeme el Volumen"" I must say that I do not doubt the fact that Michael is one of the upcoming stars in Salsa music today. This album did a great job in presenting Michael Stuart to the masses. The lyrics were wonderfully written and the production was good. ""Amor a Primera Vista"" ""Lo Que Tu Eres Para Mi"" and ""Eternamente mi Amor"" are standout tracks on this album, but every track has a genuine sound to it and you will not be dissapointed by getting a great album by Michael Stuart....the sonero you will definitely be hearing about!"
2,We need a new workout,"I read this book twice, and gave up on the 40 day program after a week because I was bored and was applying nothing new. Yes I understand that ""state of mind"" is directly related to physical performance. But I knew that before. And I know that one must ""step out of his/ her comfort zone in order to grow...etc, etc. Didn't Tony Robbins teach us that 15 years ago? The book seems hastily written, and too much like Journey into Power. I don't mean to sound bitter - and correct me if I'm wrong - but there seems to be no love behind the words, and it left me feeling cheated and depressed."
2,Didn't Hold Up Over the Years,"What was an exciting adventure novel back in the 1970's for a young pre-teen (was I ever so young?) on re-reading now turns out to be a silly James Bond knock-off/Summer beach book. The most grating conceit is the author's habit of giving every *single* female charactor a ""clever"" name (Anna Bidet - French, Randi Knickers-English, Jemima Brown-African American, etc...). It hasn't aged well."
1,Edinburgh & Dore Lectures,"this book does not contain the Dore Lectures. why does the title say it does? it is misleading advertisement, don't expect to judge a book by it's cover."
1,""""""" SOLUTION FOR FREEZING and SKIPPING PROBLEMS """"""","Only solution for skipping and freezing is to be change ""board""! I don't know what it is and is it something like the mainboards in computers but the technical service of Samsung told me that they changed it and now it is ""perfect""!"
4,samsung 511,"A great DVD player. Flawless play back. I thought I would get a cheap machine for the price, but I watch more movies on it than on my $1000 yamaha player."
4,Love this knife,"VERY easy to open with one hand, very sharp, and easy to sharpenOnly reason it got a 4 was how loose the pocket clip gets. I've owned the knife for about 6-7 months now, use it quite oftne, and the clip is very loose.The slot for cutting paracord, even for paracord, its borderline useless. It itleast looks cool.I made the mistake of trying to pry something with it and chipped the tip some, nothing someone who knows how to sharpen a knife cant fix (which wasn't me but a friend heh).I recently puchased the SOG Kilowatt, this knife has become one that I carry around when not doing a lot of work, and the kilowatt is my work knife. Love both of them and would easily buy again."
4,Sharp,"Good knife all around. It was so sharp that the first time I closed it I slightly stabbed myself. (My first tanto blade) At times I have a little trouble opening it with one hand. But other than that, I am very satisfied. It is the sharpest knife I have ever had and that includes the seal pup I also got from SOG. I have other cheaper knives, but none compare to this. SOG has me convinced that they make a good knife and the price is right."
5,Tough,"This is my first SOG knife and so far I love it. I have owned a few Kershaw knives that feature an assisted opening system and the SOG Trident performs just as well as any Kershaw. The Trident also has more features than the Kershaw knives. The pocket clip can be reversed, the safety is more solid, and also the blade lock is integrated into the side of the handle. The knife also features a slot to access the closed blade which is great for cutting rope and also comes in handy in many more applications. The blade is solid and holds it's edge better than the Kershaw knives I have. I like the black finish on the blade as well which will protect against any possible corrosion. The SOG Trident is a solid Knife an I would recommend it to my friends."
2,Awesome knife but...,"This is a very solid yet extremely light sharp knife. You can take it anywhere and everywhere and its light enough that you forget it is in your pocket. Its held up fine for everyday use including diving, fishing and boating in saltwater environments and is still sharp enough to handle any task. I highly recommend this knife.The above was my review before I tried to use my knife and the blade broke in half. For the price, I wish it were a little more durable. Before that happened I was very pleased with it."
3,"Feels too ""plasticy""","Had high hopes for this SOG but was disappointed with how ""plastic"" it felt. It felt overly hollow, and the assist feature left if ""twanging"" with resonance when opened. The blade felt thin, I was afraid I'd break it during use. I returned it and picked up a Spyderco Tenacious instead, a knife I liked much better. If you don't mind the hollow plastic feel, this would likely be a fine knife though, had no other real issues with it."
4,"Great knife,","This was my second automatic [more-like assisted] knife, and I really do like it.It opens with an authoritative thwack, and feels very secure when opened up.Sharpness: It comes razor, and I mean razor sharp out of the box. It's shave-sharp.I love the serrated edge as well, and it seems like just a well built knife.It's not quite as fast as my Kershaw with SpeedSafe, but it's a more useful knife due to its size.It's fairly large, but is is pretty much my EDC knife."
4,Great knife,"The blade on this knife is great and retains it's tanto egde very well. Out of the box its very sharp! The assisted opening works well (although not as fast as my kershaw cyclone with an even heavier tanto blade). In my mind the only thing holding this knife back from 5 stars its there is a small amount of play in the blade when its locked open. I release with folders this can never be fully eliminated, but it is a little more noticeable than I would like for a 5/5 perfect score.I still really recommend this knife"
3,"Good, in-depth picture...","... but at times author's Russian-style sentimentalism and excessive selling of his own moral stance feels annoying. When reading about horrible, appaling things, the reader does need to have it spelt out for him ""the things you have just read about are really BAD, in case you missed it"".It is a bit like watching the majority of Russian films - most actors have superb but visibly theatrical, not cinematic, training. They SPEAK!!! INTO!!! THE CAMERA!!! And. They. Speak. Loud!!! They. Make. ""Meaningful"". Pauses. Everywhere. To the point where all methods of emphasis are devalued to being meaningless.You could argue - at least it is idiosyncratic. Maybe, but I could do without it.Russians do not know the meaning of understatement. It is unfortunate that the author's extraordinary knowledge of the subject matter is not matched by his writing skills."
5,a tender generous book,"Nancy Cobb has writen a tender and genrous book about death, a perfect condolence in the saddest times.I keep several on hand. Tori Warner Shepard, Santa Fe"
1,Save your money...,"I wish I could have given this movie a negative star. Bad acting, 'slow to no' plot, bad fake monster suit, and the stupidest movie ending I've seen in years."
2,"Review of the movie ""Hypothermia""","It was poorly made with a poor plot and bad acting. The so called monster was like one from the 1940s or 1950s. It was a struggle to watch it to the end. The only thing that made sense was the title, "" Hypothermia""."
3,"Not good, not bad","This movie is okay. It tries to be funny and often it succeeds. But at times, it's not quite sure what it wants to be. I laughed a few times, and there was some interesting action scenes. But overall it just kind of meanders its way to the end without getting much of a response from me.I try not to draw comparisons to other films as that isn't always fair to either movie. But in this case, I have to mention the far superior ""White Dragon"", a movie much the same but with better humor and stronger action.This is worth seeing if you're into Asian cinema and want a little light entertainment. Otherwise, nothing much to recommend it."
1,How about no stars?,"I've seldom read a more disorganized book. If they had a point they went to great pains to hide it. The thesis that a black hole perturbed the orbit of Neptune is only one of a dozen conclusions that you could draw from the data. If they're correct no one will ever know because the ""facts"" are buried in reams of tedious and unnecessary biography - that has little to do with establishing the authors' credentials.I saw one psotive review. Must have been from a relative or a creditor.To bad Amazon doesn't give refunds"
4,Great book for decoding numbers,"This book contains vast information on option codes for Firebirds. Alond with this, it includes help in decoding the VIN, body plate, engine numbers, transmission numbers, and axle codes. There are some inaccuracies, but when teamed with the ""Firebird Red Book"", most can be solved. A must for that numbers matching Firebird."
5,Excellen t,Product arrived timely and in as or better than advertised. I would purchase more from this seller.
1,"I give it one star, but it should be -5","This seat cover has got to be one of the most worthless purchases I've ever made. It looked great when I took it out of the box, but everything went downhill after that. First off, the cover was too small for the 1984 Chevrolet standard bench seat I used it on. Luckily, the pocket in front was created by simply folding material over and making a few stitches. I cut the stitches and unfurled the material to give me just enough extra length to properly install the cover (barely). After sitting outside since I installed it in May (and getting very little use), the cover has literally disintegrated into strings and powder. I can only surmise that this thing must be made from some recycled Chinese industrial waste. The previous saddle blanket cover I had in the truck lasted approximately 20 years. DO NOT waste your money on this POS!"
5,Above Paris,Since I am a lover of Paris this book really reminds me of when I was there and how I can't wait to get back. The pictures are wonderful and I'm glad I purchased it.
3,Lovely Book...But?,"According to records The information contained in Daniel Wolff's biography is erroneous - Bertha Lee Franklin did not move to Michigan and die eighteen months after the shooting. Rather, she lived the remainder of her life in Los Angeles,Californina where she died in April 1989 at the age of 80."
4,Building the Perfect PC,"Excellent book overall. One slight deficiency, it doesn't provide a complete evaluation of MS Vista.Free shipping took 14 days."
5,Second Edition a Welcome Update,"For those reviewers who complained that the first edition was becoming dated, the second edition is finally here! If you are considering purchasing this book, be aware of the authors' biases: the Thompsons focus on selecting high-quality components with an emphasis on system reliability and reasonable overall price, at the expense of bleeding-edge performance. Consequently, this book is not likely to entice the overclocking and benchmarking crowd, although overclockers will also benefit from being familiar with the Thompsons' hardware recommendations and the reasoning behind those recommendations. As for this book's target audience, readers whose goal is to build a home or small office PC that Just Works, this book is an invaluable and remarkably comprehensive guide."
2,Zzzzzzzzz...,"I didn't thorougly enjoy reading ""Robinson Crusoe."" It was very repetitious--why did Crusoe tell us about his adventures and then go back and retell what he already told in his journal? Also, I found some of the story confusing. I saw the movie, it's very different from the book...I didn't particularly like either."
2,Classic? Come On!,"This book is a disgrace to the lable ""classic."" It repeats too much stuff again and again and begins to bore you out of your wits, so much that I'd like to burn my copy of the book in the fire, but its the library's. Although it did have some good points, I'd rather be stuck on his Island than read this book again. Thankyou, and Goodnight."
1,I'm not sure why it's a classic!,After you get past the unbearable first few chapters it gets a little better. found it a hard book to follow and enjoy at the same time. But it's a classic so you have to read it someday!
3,A must-read for environmentalists,"Probably the finest critique of Defoe's landmark novel is the one appearing in a 1950's issue of MAD magazine.Defoe inadvertantly portrays all that is immoral and hypocritical in the western man's approach to nature and the environment. Crusoe is cruel to animals (on pikes, he impales the bodies of little birds with the intention of frightening others from his crops). He is wasteful of natural resources (whittles down one large tree to make a shelf). He is an outright coward (he is terribly afraid of a goat).This rather rambling, disorganized book is nonetheless a sharp indictment of man's supposed superiority over nature. Fascinating fodder for the student of ecological literary criticism."
4,A Great Hammock Classic,"I felt compelled to read this book and am glad that I did even though it was not spellbinding. DeFoe's ability to conjure up the day to day survival struggle in such great detail was the epitome of creative inspiration. To understand Robinson Crusoe's journey and motivation is to appreciate one's own and even on a broader scale, to understand human nature. Personally, the lesson it reinforced in me is that self-esteem stems from overcoming obstacles and attaining wisdom as a result. And his being grateful to Providence is a celebration of divinely or spiritually inspired action that cannot come from without but has to come from within."
2,Only half is with Blue,"I was disappointed to see that the first half of the show was with Steve and no Blue. My almost 3 yr old son went around saying, ""oh no, no Blue"" for the first 20-25 min. Although it is a fine move, I'm glad I only paid little at Target for it since we only watch half of the movie all the time."
1,Turn down this invitation,Why oh why was this made! This show is just plain SICK SICK SICK! I mean what's the big deal over a blue dog. A BLUE DOG FOR THE LOVE OF PETE! Go out and show your kids the real world!
4,Valuable health book,"I found this book much more readable than the previous one I've read by the author - ""The liver-cleansing diet"".The present one is divided into two parts, one dealing with the liver and the other with the bowels.The author presents comprehensive but easily understandable information about all the various liver and bowel diseases. Much of this information was new to me, especially that on bowel problems. Valuable treatment suggestions as regards diet and supplements are included for each disease/complaint.The final part of the book comprises healthy recipes, though I personally did not find these as useful as in the former book, since I could not use most of them as they included too many ingredients I can't eat, at least for the meantime. However, they will be useful for most readers.To sum up, this is an extremely informative and helpful book for all those suffering from liver or bowel diseases, or interested in learning about how to prevent them."
1,The book is an attempt to justify a preformulated conclusion,"This book is written for people who want their existing political view reinforced, if you want information rather than have episodes that support a given view cherry picked from a mountain of data, look else where."
5,The Animation Show,"Awesome stories. Not necessarily for kids, but for the kid in you. I really enjoy the styles with live stop-action posing with claymation and doll contortions. Aria brings tears to my eyes and I always laugh at intermission. I want the other volumes. Vive L'Animation"
1,Wanted to like it...,"This book rings false. Katherine Weber probably tried really hard to pull off this Alcott thing, but her ""plot"" and phrasing is quite off."
4,Buy it for jaybird,"Jaybird has got to be a hardcore classic. Some dont like it prefering the earlier stuff but this was the first one I heard back in the day and got to say it hooked me. Jaybird, The whip and Token Entry were the tracks that stood out for me, they just had something differnet from the standard hardcore at the time.Cant say I ever heard weight of the world and got to say pretty glad I didnt. Rock cheese that makes DYS fire and ice, or latter Gang Green stuff sound good. Its just painful to listen to the guys who were recording this must have had blood coming from their ears."
3,Of course it's stupid fantasy...,"and this video is worth the money just to hear the black girl in the Davy Jones episode ask Marcia (referring to Davy) -- all excited and bubbly -- ""is he as neat as he looks?"" Yeah, right. I like the end of the episode when Marcia and Davy stand side by side, and you can get an idea of just how short Davy is - he is shorter than Maureen McCormick. The ""oh my nose"" episode is pure fantasy -- and as for Marcia episode it's right up there with the Romeo and Juliet and braces episode --the family that paints together? Marcia's swollen nose disappears overnight? The Big Man on Campus asks Marcia out? She ultimately chooses Charlie the awkward delivery boy? And in the former episode, Marcia enters Davy's recording studio -- while he's recording no less -- without any problems? If you ask these questions then you definitely won't enjoy it. If you don't care about reality...then this is the best! Crank up ""Girl"" and drive your neighbors nuts!"
5,good purchase!,i've gotten alot of compliments on how awesome my shoes are just from putting on these shoelaces i would not reccomend buying them unless you have a pair of skater shoes though
2,Junk chic,"I am sorry, I absolutely love decorating books, but this one ..in my opinion....is awful. Mostly faux painting techniques. Ordered one for a decorator friend and could not give it to her. Afraid the books will be donated to Goodwill, hope someone can get some good from them. There are so many really good decorating books available, just not this one. The Better Homes and Gardens books are always good."
5,Hope there's a sequel.,"I read The Bridge Party twice.The pace of the book matched the story and the mood of the women. The characters were so real. I really liked the attention to detail. I could almost picture the room in my mind and see the characters moving about gracefully in a traditional southern way. Even as the tension built it maintained the same flavor. Reading it was like being carried down a river out to sea where i could feel the gentle currents gaining strength.I only wish it had been longer as there was so much potential, so many more stories to be told. The Bridge Pary was like a beginning. I hope the author is considering a followup book."
2,A displeasing hot sauce,"For quite some time, I have been using different types of hot sauce on different types of food. Before I started doing this, I only ever remember using hot sauce on barbeque sandwiches. Even though I have tried numerous types of hot sauce during this period, El Yucateco has set itself apart from the others as being one that I do not care for. It is overpoweringly hot--with a searing heat--and has an odd, unenjoyable flavor. Although not a terrible hot sauce--I consumed the entire bottle--El Yucateco is a hot sauce that I am glad that I tried, but it just is not my thing."
5,Impressed,"Looks as advertised - actually cooler in person I think. Sound quality is very high, much better than expected. Only complaint, could be louder, but certainly loud enough for anyone working at the computer which is the whole point.***** for bang for the buck."
5,Love 'em,I got these for christmas. These are the ultimate 2.1 speakers. PERFECT sound. Room-rattling bass. A little pricey for 2.1's but worth every penny.
5,Crisp and pleasing to the eye,"Great sound quality versus my 3 month old Logitech Z 2300. Deeper (not louder) more crisp bass, just a much richer sound including mids/highs. To me, this product is well worth the extra 20 bucks versus the Logitech.Just my $0.02,LT"
1,The satellite speakers fell apart,Okay - I have had them for two years but damn - I wouldn't think that BOTH satellite speakers would come apart. One did and the second followed in three weeks. Super weak... I mean for the money - these look and sound GREAT! But now I have to get some Gorilla Glue and put them back together. Suckfest.
4,"Great Sound, Great Design, Great Price","these speakers are definitely worth every bang for your buck. i definitely did my research on other speakers before getting these and these out shinned the others for its price range. they look amazing, sound amazing, and so easy to use. theyre great for everyday use but theyre definitely not loud enough to run a party. this is a great product. love it!"
1,"be forewarned, if your thinking of using this with Airport Express","This Amazon listing also suggests buying the Soundsticks along with Airport Express.If you're thinking of connecting them to the USB port of Express, Apple says it won't work.(Apple Airport Express FAQs)"
3,Ok for the price,This is a good sound system for the price. The plus is that it sounds good for music. The negative is that it is hard to get good speech quality because the base (woofer) is too much even at the lowes setting. I could not watch a movie with it because the speech was too hard to understand (sounds distant and muffled). Too bad- I only tested it for music in the store.
5,What a happy surprise!,"This is an amazing value.Great bass. Great stereo separation. Great clarity. Fabulous price. With this little unit and iTunes, my PC is now bringing amazing sound to my office. What a trip.eric"
4,Harman Kardon Soundsticks II-,"Easy to install and crisp and clear sound. Like the external Sub woofer controls. However, the documentation didn't indicate how to controll the sound level. Had to read the Q/A to find out about sound level control."
