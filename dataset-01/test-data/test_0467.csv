2,Not my type of lube,"i did not like it as much as i thought i would, it doesnt taste good nore those it last very long even if you use alot still but its worth the money to just use if ure in need of lube for the price its cheap"
2,Surprise!,"I wouldn't call this a plug and play item. I was not able to install the camera after following the instructions carefully.Three hours later I spotted a little sticker placed on the box. ""Compatible with the following Sony approved routers"". My Belkin router is not on the list. Surprise!Let me save you hours of aggravation. The approved router list is not on the Sony website or on the Amazon description of this network camera.Approved routers: Linksys WRT65G,Linksys WRT54GS,D-Link D-Link 504,D-Link 604,D-Link 624, Netgear WGT624,Netgear WGT634U"
1,Disappointing lifespan.,"As soon as I received these rechargeable batteries, I placed them in my recharger. Once the light is off, the batteries are charged. I then placed them in my Sony digital camera, and the icon showed the batteries to be fully charged. I took exactly 14 digital photos, and after the 14th photo - the battery icon on the camera showed the batteries to be LESS than 25% charged. This is very disappointing, as these batteries are not inexpensive. I will not order this particular brand again. If anyone reading review this has better luck with a different brand, I'd be most grateful for a recommendation, as I am now forced to reorder new batteries."
5,Excellent batteries!!,I put 2 AA batteries in my kid's toy. He plays with it everday for almost 2 months now... still running.
5,The most important book you many ever read....,"This book could very easily save your life. While it reaffirmed things I know about fiber, insulin, and exercise, it gave me a lot of new information about how to keep from getting prostate cancer (like my father had), and other important information. It also described ""insulin resistance"", which is something that I have and has baffeled my doctor for well over a year! Dr. Bob, thanks for writing this great book."
1,The Night Walker,"Awful. Slow, bad effects, bad acting, bad writing..... Not even historically accurate. Really says everything right there. The entire movie is just 'satanic' music/chanting with Ramirez walking aimlessly while sucking on a lollipop. There are some 10 second kill scenes and some random flashback fillers. And oh yeah, throw in some garbage inner monolague and you come up with this waste of 85 minutes. So coming from an avid horror/thriller/B-movie fan, just don't bother.PS. If you do make the mistake of watching this. Listen for the amazing sound effects of the mob beating Ramirez. It is literally the sound crew popping bubble wrap!"
2,Poor Picture when using wireless,I found this camera frustrating. I couldn't get it to initilize when I first got it. I ended up having to ship it back to get it reset. Once I got it back I was very frustrated in setting it up. I finally got it hooked up on the LAN but needed to set up the WLAN. That took some doing but eventually I got it running. I put the camera up and the picture quality is poor at best. I'm not sure if it's because it's wireless or just the camera itself. I was hoping for a much better picture.
3,"Um..okay, but nothing to write home about","After reading the ""BAD"" collection of short stories (could the name be any dorkier??), there was no way I could justify buying the hardback of a full-length story, but I did purchase the paperback. This is a better story than the shorter ones, but you'd expect that with more space. The plot itself is pretty thin, especially at the end - the story resolution wraps up with a ridiculously pretty bow. BUT, I will give Sherrilyn Kenyon credit - her sex scenes are still hot! They may not have that much depth, but the main characters Syd and Steele (again, goofy name) definitely have chemistry. This is a good beach book - not that demanding and fairly entertaining."
2,Less Than Helpful,"I am a conservative Christian, who heartily agrees with Mr. Roberts that the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is not an orthodox Christian denomination. On a purely personal basis, some small part of me yearns for the good old days when the orthodox were allowed to excommunicate, pillory or imprison heretics.Nevertheless, Mr. Roberts' book is less than helpful. He does not do his job well.The primary defect with Mr. Roberts' work is that he never engages Mormonism in a genuine debate. Instead, he presents a caricature of Mormonism, and then proceeds to debate against the straw man that he has created.Mr. Roberts' work would be much more helpful for faithful Christians if he were to engage an accredited representative of Mormonism in a bona fide debate, trusting the power of Gospel truth to win the victory over Joseph Smith's abominable innovation."
3,NOT A REVIEW,"this is not a review of the book, and i hope i haven't changed its rating, but i feel that i must clarify something about what other people have said.i grew up a Morman, now i am an atheist (sort of). I also attended a methodist church for about five years while i lived with my aunt. Mormons are NO different than any other christian religian except the fact that they are heavily family oriented and other churches are act like a lunatic and scream hallelujiah oriented. That was kind of a joke.Bassically it comes to this, Mormon doctrine sometimes contradicts the Bible. So What? the BIBLE contradicts the bible. the last supper doesnt have the same events in any of the four gospels. i know, i've read them, in NIV and KJ versions. the Mormons only use kj.therefore if mormons aren't christians because they're doctrine contradicts the bible, then what are christians because theirs does too."
1,A Better Title: Anti-Mormonism Unmasked,"Having read hundreds of books on Mormonism, both by those who are ""friendly"" to the LDS faith, and those with an axe to grind, this is probably one of the most shoddy attempts at ""exposing"" the LDS church I have seen. Like most faiths, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has issues which one can legitimately question and disagree with. However, this book simply regurgitates the same tired, hackneyed, worn-out accusations which have been levied against the LDS Church since the mid-1800's. And, of course, it is done under the guise of ""scholarly objectivity.""Dr. Roberts is profiting from a publication which seeks to denigrate millions of people whose desire apparently is to better know and understand Christ. That alone merits questioning his professional, ecclesiastical, and financial motives."
5,Absolutely the Best,"I used this book for training my Springer Spaniel. He is my constant companion because I can trust him to behave in all conditions. Why? I attribute it to early training using the methods in the book and good genetics, plus lots of time and love. I have heard dozens of times now that he is the ""Best behaved dog"" that folks have ever seen. READ THE BOOK BEFORE YOU BUY YOUR PUP. Then you'll get the full benefit of both. Follow the methods ad have the ""Best trained dog"" people have ever seen."
1,Don't waste your time.,"I'm pretty tolerant of mediocre books and usually enjoy anything featuring dragons, but this one was pretty awful. The author does a very poor job of making you care about what happens to the characters, the writing style is boring, and my god, I've never seen so many run-on, comma-filled sentences in my life. The first sentence of the book is an entire paragraph with something like 20 commas in it. Ridiculous. If you want a GOOD series of books with dragons being employed as weapons of war I suggest the Temeraire series by Naomi Novik.As for this, skip it."
3,Wear a bib,"Love the product. But, just try to pull back the cover without getting sprayed--that is if you are lucky enough so that the pop top doesn't rip off. If you are at home, you can use a can opener. But if you are in the office having a can for lunch, your shirt will also have a can for lunch. Poor quality control for a very expensive, but nutritional, product. The price per case is way to much. Unfortunately, they never go on sale. So, make a deal with the manufacturer that every can comes with a can opener and you're good to go."
4,"An album that will ""Take You Away""","went to see Simple Plan the other night at the Nokia Theatre. First came on Paramore, a band I thought sucked. Right before Simple Plan, a band called Straylight Run, who made me feel like I was on heavy drugs, and I didnt like it. I was sick, and they sucked too. But right in the middle of those two was a band called Plain White T's. As soon as they came onto the stage, everyone went crazy. They were fun, funny, great musicians, un songs, and sold their CD for cheap ($7). I must say, they will be the next Simple Plan. As soon as the show was over I went to buy their CD, and I met the Lead singer, who signed it for me. He was really nice. Then I went home and listened to my CD, and I was hooked. Plain White T's are an amazing band, I recommend them to anyone who likes good, catchy music. Their album ""All That We Needed"" is a must have, so I suggest you stop reading and go out and buy this right now.Signed,Diana"
4,"mediocre vocals, awesome rhythm","I saw Plain White T's live at the Fox Theater in Detroit. I'd never heard them before, but I was instantly enthralled by their music. The bass and drum lines really grab you. I actually disliked the lead singer - his voice sounds okay, but his personality is abrasive. Regardless of that, the music is really good. The guitar is awesome, the drums and bass are spectacular. The vocals are mediocre, but the music makes up for it."
4,Perfect!,"I received this lens hood today and it works well. To my surprise it's not as flimsy as I thought it would be. It attaches to the 18-55mm kit lens of my T2i just fine, it can also be attached in reverse for storage to conserve space in your camera bag or if you just don't need it at the moment. Probably would have given it a 5 star but I haven't got to use it that much and it might be better if it screwed into the lens itself or filter, but the jury is still out on that! Just starting out in photography? Great addition for a great price! Cheaper than the actual Canon part!"
2,Get some other brand,"Not a great product. The build material seems fine but not a perfect fit. Its a struggle to get on and off. A rather loose fit. Also, the lettering on the actual product is different. Though thats not much of an issue, its not as advertised.I got another one from fotodiox for my 55-200 lens. That is awesome. Fits perfectly. Very convenient to use.Maybe I just got a bad piece."
4,beautiful paintings,great paintings but i wish she described more the colors she used in her techniques...and maybe some more specific details about her techniques
3,Flowers from the Best,Janet is a great Watercolor artist. She has many examples with the list of colors and the design of her composition as well as step by step instructions.
3,worth it,"I liked this book because there are many full page illustrations- which makes it easier to copy and learn. I have bought too many books where the pictures are too small to see the strokes or colors. The instructions are specific. As a flower lover and painter, I am happy with my purchase. This is a good beginner or intermediate watercolor instruction book."
1,Simply Unacceptable,"As a librarian working in a univeristy science library, I had to return this book. I cannot let tax and tuition dollars support this dumbed-down farce propagated by greedy pomo publishers. I can remember the day when such books would never have made it past WW Norton's editors, but alas, the new breed was raised on MTV.Infinity is infinity is infinity, and its glory remains untouched by this trifling, ludicrous, incompitent, meandering, and fundamentally dishonest effort. Visit your library, or my library, and read the books on mathematics penned by articulate mathematicians--there are plenty of them. Don't believe the pomo hype."
1,A not intuitive search.,"From my point of view, this dictionary system of searching for a kanji -which is based on so called ""kanji patterns""- is more arbitrary or less intuitive than the traditional system. For example, I miss a simple feature which is an index of kanji by number of strokes, which is the last resort and simplest way to look for a kanji when one does not find it other way, so that I think that any kanji dictionary would better have an index by number of strokes. In my view the Kodansa Essential Kanji Dictionary is easier to use and a preferent choice."
3,"A Decent, Exciting Read","I read Color of Night, because it sounded interesting (though I don't usually like spy novels). I am still glad I read it, but my opinions are mixed. Lindsey's treatment of action was superb - I really almost felt the anxiety of the characters as they executed their plans. But the book was quite a bit longer than it needed to be, and only a few characters did I really like (or care about). Attention to detail was good, and the various European locales were refreshing. All and all, while the story could have been better, it was still a decent and thrilling read for me, and I may well read more of this author's works."
2,It's just okay.,"I wanted to love this book but really it's just okay. I feel like the composite characters are totally predictable/stereotypical. The author never sheds her upper east side image, nor does she try to. Also, her attempts at humility are totally transparent - clearly she thinks she's the cream of the crop despite her grouping herself among the ""Desperadoes"" who are her clients.It just didn't give me the juicy stuff I was looking for."
4,From another matchmaker,"I'm also a matchmaker and dating coach, and I thought this book was cute. I could see some of my own experiences mirrored here, though it makes me appreciate heavily that I'm a married matchmaker! I held back on the 5th star as it was a little sour in it's overall flavor, and I love focus on the positive!"
5,Advocate of Dialogue Fethullah Gulen,"The book arrived promptly an in flawless condition. I bought the book on the recommendatiuon of a rabbi friend. It is a very interesting book about a very interesting man. I have not read the book completely, but I am glad I have it I am sure it will be valuable in an Interfaith Relations context."
5,Daring Innovative and Original,"I've followed Annie's career for several years and this is her best work yet. This is not Avril Lagvigne's cutesy pop. If that is what you want, then pass on this disc. Annie has blended a huge number of influences and distilled them into something truly unique. Her sound can't just be compared to 1 or 2 or 10 different artists. It is deep and complex yet simple and pure. This music for musicians and you will hear something new every time you listen. 5 Stars."
2,Does not cover the prerequisites,"If you are looking to find out about the IMAP protocol - This book is very good, I bought it to help me install the Cyrus imap server. The book covers the installation of cyrus but it does not cover the prerequisites. I found the hardest part of setting up the Cyrus server was dealing with the software prerequisites, i.e. tcl and cyrus sasl. If you are interested in learning about the IMAP protocol, this is the book, if you are interested in setting up Cyrus - save your money."
2,Historical Women as seen by the National Enquirer,"As these three women have been historical figures for more than 50 years, any material on them is of great interest to many. Taken in parts, ""Jackie, Ethel and Joan: Women of Camelot"" seems to provide a window into Kennedy personal lives. But the book is written with a degree of familiarity I doubt the author had in reality. I always question quoting long conversations from 40+ years ago, especially when the author wasn't there, and the people involved have died so can no longer rebut. His actual subject seems to be ""famous women whose husbands cheat"". While I found the book interesting, by the time I'd finished it, I questioned Taraborrelli's chosen slant. He concentrated on sleaze at the expense of history. These women lead very interesting lives, but relatively little of that is included here."
1,"A rehash of old, stale gossip with invented & banal dialogue","This book is a tired and stale rehash of the Kennedy saga - filled with unsubstantiated gossip,trite (and ficticious) dialogue and little in the way of good writing, strong research or insight. This is cheesy fan magazine stuff. Haven't the Kennedy ladies suffered enough without this type of book popping up?Give these gals a break...but if you can't (and it seems few can)read a good book about them, like Larry Leamers KENNEDY WOMEN."
3,"VERY INTERESTING BOOK - ? FACTUAL, I THINK NOT!","I cannot say I did not enjoy reading this book. Anyone who grew up in the age of the Kennedy power has to be at least remotely interested in these three women's stories. Being privy to private conversations between them and feeling you are a part of what happened is also very seductive, however I just cannot believe that this book is accurate and factual. Private conversations were written about between people who would have absolutely no reason to discuss these conversation with an outside person. Although the topic was fascinating, I would say that your best bet would be to view this book as a Truman Capote genre book, a fiction based on some facts. You might enjoy it, but I wouldn't use it as historical reference material."
4,"Jackie, Ethel, Joan: Women of Camelot","Prior to reading this book, I knew quite a bit about Jackie and Ethel. I did not know much about Joan. It was a very interesting insite into the Kennedy Women's life. A life that made you feel sorry for all of them. The book was very favorable to Jackie and Joan, but made Ethel appear to be petty."
4,Not exactly what I expected,I thought that the stones were black but they are blue. That could be my fault. I did expect it to be more victorian looking. They're very shiny so if that what you want then they're perfect. I really can't complain about the earrings. They are pretty and look really nice. They just aren't what I wanted. I bought it as a gift for my niece who is very artsy and likes alot of unique items. I will probably keep for myself or give to someone else and buy something else for my niece. I would recommend this product if you want shiny silver with blue stones.
4,It was cool,"I'm 15 years old and I like to write short stories in my spare time. I noticed that many people disaprove of James Redfield writing style. It's hard to please everyone when you write. It didn't matter to me that the type was large or how far fetched the plot seems. Fiction is fiction. I thought it was great how his charecters learned from their mistakes and they improved their lives more in every book. When I read this book I took all of it totally seriously. If his ""Fictional"" insights were followed then the world would probably be a better place."
2,A bit far fetched,"I will admit that the Celestine prophecy was believable but I was somewhat disappointed with this book. The early chapters were interesting but the last two chapters were unbelievably far fetched and I just could not believe what I was reading. The author comes out with these statements about how we will become better people but the mechanism and guidelines to get there seemed so unachievable and downright complicated. The whole ""seeing into the future"" bit at the end sounded like a cross between Star Trek and Harry Potter and had me both giggling and laughing out loud. That's it........if nothing else the book is a good laugh."
3,Bogle Is Dead Wrong!,"John Bogle is a nice guy, but he is dead wrong about the stock market and about active management of mutual funds. His thesis: All performance regresses to the mean, therefore you cannot beat the market over time. Better to buy the market via index funds, do so at lowest cost, and hold for the long term. That approach guarantees slightly better than average performance. Much better approach: rank order all no-load mutual funds by alpha, and select a diversified portfolio of those at the top according to your asset allocation profile. Monitor alphas over time. Periodically rebalance, but especially replace any mutual fund when its alpha falls below 0 with one that has a positive alpha. You will end up with a dollar balance far above that following Bogel's advice. I am surprised that Don Phillips, head of Morningstar,Inc. does not know this."
5,The Human Approach,"I especially loved the chapter ""On Human Beings."" It shows that in a world where you always feel like a number John Bogle has instilled in Vanguard the human being approach. Not only is he knowledgeable about mutal funds he knows what is needed behind the scenes to keep them successful. Great job Mr. Bogle"
4,Merits of Index Fund Investing,"Although a good resource book about the benefits of mutual fund investing,I found the title to be a bit misleading. Being the self proclaimed creator of index funds, Bogle cites many years of comparative returns from mutual funds while making the case that,over the long run, investing in index funds will produce the highest returns. I think a more apt title might be ""Why Index Funds Beat All""."
3,Solid investment advice for individual investors,"Bogle's investment advice is rock solid, but I found his repetition irritating. What I found particulary fresh was his critique of the mutual fund industry. I suspect relatively few individual investors are aware of the governance and incentive problems that Bogle highlights."
5,Fascinating,"This book is part of a series that looks at cities all over the country. While this book would most likely be of limited interest to non-Hoosiers, I found this book to be riveting. I've lived in Indy for 15 years now and I often visited the city as a child.The format of the book is side by side photos of an Indianapolis address in the past (from 60 - 150 years ago) and a current (2004) photo of the same building. Sometimes the same buildings and landmarks are still in places, other times there are whole new buildings and landscapes.Most striking is the changes in the area around Indy's much lauded canal walk, White River State Park and IUPUI. I was also surprised that the Indianapolis Star building is actually quite old - two beautiful buildings with character were merged into one building and then covered with one of the most boring brick facades I have ever seen on any buiding anywhere. Too bad.Strongly recommended for residents of Indianapolis as a unique gift."
4,Pretty Knits,"When buying a book of patterns it is often being purchased just for one pattern that you have seen and like so much that you are prepared to pay the book price. I thought that was going to be the case when buying this book as I was purchasing it just for the Shell pattern knitted in Venus yarn (how pretty is that Shell?)but was pleasantly surprised to find a few other patterns that have caught my eye and that, along with the very reasonable price paid, has made this book a bargain.Probably one of my better purchases."
4,Classic toy,"Although it is not as well built as the one I grew up with it is still a classic. My nephew loves it and he learned a little about magnets and physics, even if he doesn't know he learned something."
1,PIECE OF CRAP-O,"The Wheel in the middle keeps falling off. POS. If the spacer is moved to the front, the wheel touches it and slows down immediately. what a fail."
3,works but flimsy construction,"The toy works, very fun and educational for my 4 year old. Only thing I did not like is that the construction/quality is not what I expected, it seems pretty flimsy. Other defect I observed is that the red tab which moves up or down to control distance between two wire rails is not well placed. If you move it up to reduce distance between wire rail then it starts bumping into the rotating wheel. If you move it down, now the distance between wire rail is too large for the wheel axle to ride on it. It just has to be right, there is very tiny margin of error!!!"
2,A one-way dictionary,"I found this dictionary to be totally useless because it only goes one way, Arabic to English. Which is OK unless you don't know alphabetical order in Arabic. And for the price, you would expect it should be a two-way dictionary but it's not. I found the Hippocrene Practical Dictionary to be much better, much cheaper, and it goes both ways (English to Arabic and Arabic to English)."
4,The Hans Wehr Dictionary of Modern Written Arabic,"This is NOT the dictionary for those looking for a quick method of translating Arabic to English or vice versa. Rather, it is based on the way the Arabic language is structured, with the three root character groupings that comprise perhaps 95% of all words. Based on this fact, it is very close to being a ""perfect"" solution for looking up definitions. Those seeking a quick answer to the ""how do I say....?"" question are better off getting one of those pocket guides that give you transliterations in English. If you are serious about learning the Arabic Language, the Hans Wehr book is the pretty much today's ""bible"" for Mondern Standard Arabic."
5,True example of how all Christians should be,"Harold Hill's testimony in this book is a true inspiration. This is a man that read Mark 16:15-18 and took it at face value. (Mark 16:15-18 ""He said to them, ""Go into all the world and preach the good news to all creation. Whoever believes and is baptized will be saved, but whoever does not believe will be condemned. And these signs will accompany those who believe: In my name they will drive out demons; they will speak in new tongues; they will pick up snakes with their hands; and when they drink deadly poison, it will not hurt them at all; they will place their hands on sick people, and they will get well."")"
2,Just Look'N learn Spanish Picture Dictionary,"I find this to be a terrible dictionary. My son loved it at first. But, it does not show the pronunciation marks to help us know how to pronounce things. Dumbest dictionary I've ever seen."
2,Very disappointing!,"These sheets DO NOT fit the mattress size that they say!!! Our bed is 18"" and the sheets said that they would accommodate 19"" and the fitted sheet only goes half way down and the flat sheet is not even close to being able to be tucked in!!!"
2,SUB PAR TIME TRAVEL,"NAUTILUS is one of those time wasters that you wonder why you bothered.A tepid script, amateurish special effects and a fairly wooden cast all add up to sink this movie. While it does have an unexpected twist at the end, getting there requires a lot of patience and suspension of belief. I appreciate the conundrum time travel movies generate, but once you take the plunge, the director should at least strive for consistency and a competent cast.Richard Norton, starting to show his age, but still in pretty buff shape uses his nonchalant machoism, which doesn't serve the urgency of the plot. Hannes Jaenicke (Venomous, Mom's Outta Sight) usually does better, but he's as comatose as Norton in this one. Miranda Wolf tries, but only her lithe beauty keeps her interesting. Christopher Kreisa as Captain Brann needs to return to acting school; he can't carry this kind of role.Not recommended."
3,No Alan Moore,"I'm glad this was written, but the Alan Moore Swamp Thing series is MUCH better than this origin story."
5,The Dating Pool,"I can definately relate to the guys profiled in this book and than some! I personally thought the book was highly entertainning. Would recommend it specially to anyone out in the dating scene or anyone who just wants a good laugh. The authors are not down on men just relating stories of all the different characters you encounter as you open yourself up to go out with a perfect stranger that you hope in the back of your mind may turn out to be Mr. Right and Forever. By the way, I don't want to get in to a war of words, this is not the appropriate place, but I am not a so called ""fake"" and my personal opinions carry the same weight as anyone else's. I hope all reviewers will take the high road and not resort to Jr. high antics."
4,Zinnon Shoe Review,Good looking pump with good arch support. But color comes off when I tried to shine it...
3,Good,"Foolish Behaviour by Rod Stewart is a good CD, it is not his best but is definitely worth having."
5,assessment text book,"The shipping for this item was pretty fast. The book is in great condition and was fairly priced. The description did not tell me that it was a hardcover book, but that was a positive surprise for me!"
3,Opposites Attract,"All in all this was not a bad story. Just was not my favorite by this author. Juliet's confrontation with her jealous rival was anti-climatic. It was tastefully handled. But I think a Black Swan element, where the rival's actions intended for evil and destruction are changed to good, would have given this book a suspenseful twist. I hope Ms. Norfleet continues to pen more romance titles. Her Mama Lou character was cute and will be missed."
5,Irresistible you,I really enjoy reading Mamma lou matchmaking stories. They are so cute and make you feel like it could be you.
2,Lacks Dutch-to-English dictionary,"I bought what is perhaps an earlier edition of this phrasebook via Amazon, used; it arrived promptly in fine condition. However, as we tried to use the book in Amsterdam, its lack of a Dutch-to-English dictionary was revealed as a serious flaw (there is an English-to-Dutch dictionary). We subsequently bought the Lonely Planet Dutch phrasebook and dictionary, which did have a Dutch-to-English dictionary as well as an English-to-Dutch dictionary. We needed Dutch-to-English mostly for signs; everyone in Amsterdam seems to speak English pretty well!"
3,non-stick?,I've tried spraying the cups when they are room temp and when they are heated; never are they non-stick and always they require scrubbing.
1,Few time the pan is broken....,Few time the pan is broken.... And the shape not good when the pan up side down the egg over.:(
3,Good But The Bolts Break Easily.,The goal which is moderately difficult to put together will work as supplied but I would strongly suggest you take the included bolts to your local hardware store and get replacements. The ones included are shockingly weak and will definitely break.
4,Are you CRAZY???,"This CD is so awsome!! Stacy's Mom is the greatest song ever. The theme is great, the lyrics are awsome and it has a humerous flare. If you want to test the water a little bit, then tune your radio into almost any pop rock/hip hop station to hear it. But for the suspicous ones still out there take this advise: Even if you don't get CD at least do yourself the favor of getting a slammin' party started by cranking up the radio and lettin' loose with Stacy's Mom!!"
1,"5 stars for the song, -4 for the price! BUY THE ALBUM!!!!!!!","First off, for those reviewers who were too ignorant to find out ANTYING about this song and this band....This is NOT a ""Novelty Song!"" And Fountains of Wayne are far, far from a ""corporate"" one-hit-wonder band. This is a great, great single from one of the best albums of 2003 and one of the most criminally overlooked bands of the past 10 years or so.There's a reason that the reviewers love this band - lame-brained customer reviewers like Rozz and Mistermaxxx just don't seem to get it - which says more about them than it does about the song.However, my recommendation is DON'T BOTHER BUYING THE SINGLE. $12.99 for one song and a couple of B-Sides? C'mon. Spend the extra buck and get the whole album, and you'll see why it made a bunch of ""Best Of"" lists for this past year."
4,Little One!,"Cute little Webkinz! Sweet size for small child, but older children like too. Allows access to Webkinz website, just like larger ones. Definitely worth the price!"
5,Jump Ship to Freedom,"""Help there is a fire!"" Mrs. Ivers said. Daniel Arabus sneeks into Mrs. Ivers room and steels his fathers soldiers notes. Daniel Arabus is a black slave boy who wants to buy his mom and his freedom. When Mr. Ivers takes Daniel on the Junius Brutus(Captian Ivers' boat)he has to get to New York to give his fathers soldiers notes to Mr. Johnson so he can but his family free. The problem is he is a fugitive slave and doesn't know if the notes are worth anything. This book is probably the best book I have ever read. It is a good book because Daniel is clever enough to even get the notes. The book just wows me so much I can't explain it! I hope that James Lincoln Collier and Christopher Collier keep writing amazing books like Jump Ship to Freedom."
4,Ok Book,"I read this book for a language arts project in school. It was alright but it wasn't the best book I've ever read. The book was about a boy named Daniel whose father fought in the Revolutionary War and was granted soldiers notes which could be exchanged for cash and buy his family's freedom from slavery. But Daniel's father died and left the notes with Daniel and his mom. The book was about Daniel trying to get these notes to Congress and exchange these for money. I recommend this book to anyone interested in slavery or the Revolutionary War,"
5,Very useful (as always)!,"I own four Eyewitness Travel Guides (France, Germany, Greece and Spain) and they are always useful for my trips. Additionally, I use them as guides even when I am not travelling anywhere, just to get knowledege about places I will not visit. Sometimes I think that some information as ticket pricing is necessary and not provided by this guide, but it is a minor issue when we see the complete usefulness of it."
2,Driving me to another book...,"I have used LP guides for the better part of 25 years and usually am very happy with them. Now I am traveling with my family including two kids and IO thought I might want to go in a different direction. I was attracted to the DK guides because of the high quality glossy photos - thinking that this was a good way to have the whole family see what was ahead in order to make good decisions for everyone. On the plus side the driving maps were very good and quite helpful. But overall, for a family on the move the book was lacking. Yes, the photos are great and got everyone psyched about possible destinations, but in terms of actual information for museums, lodging, restaurants and the like, the book was severely lacking. Also the information given on any particular site was very basic and simplistic."
5,Very good guide,"Has lots of pics, very good guide. All the major attractions in spain in 1 book. Used it in Spain every day."
2,ok,"These books are nice to look at, but offer very little in terms of actual touring and travel knowledge. The are fiendishly constructed, listing little blurbs about the towns and then in the back of the book they have an index of hotels and restaurants. This is not a very efficient way to go about looking for accommodations etc.It seems that with these books they assume you will be renting a car. There is VERY LITTLE/NO INFO in terms of any information pertaining to bus or train travel. I think for a lot of people this would be very frustrating.With that said, there are some nice drawings (map drawings questionable) and good photos."
4,Good but a little expensive,"I'm happy with the service and the plan. At least in Austin, TX the signal is good. The 4 stars are because I think is a little more expensive than other companies"
3,Sweet but rushed,Book provided by publisher.This was a sweet read. Good plot and interesting characters. It felt rushed at the end though
1,Does not stick,"The adhesive backing on this product does not stick well. I followed the directions, making sure the surface was clean, and applied the weather stripping. The next morning most of the weather stripping had fallen off."
1,I do not recommend this book,"I got this book in anticipation of my first trip to Paris and was very disappointed by it. It's not amusing, insightful, or well-written. Though some reviewers here seem to think that the author is criticizing French people, it was apparent to me that she is actually criticizing Americans. In doing so, she clings to stereotypes. Here's an excerpt from the book, as an example, ""In some ways, Frenchwomen are much less on their guard around men than we Americans are. They do delicious things, such as laugh at off-color jokes, and don't yell sexual harassment when complimented on their hairdo. They can disagree with a man--and keep their cool. So refreshing.""Ugh! I couldn't even finish it."
4,Bravo!,"I am French,and I have been living here for 15 years, going back and forth. This book is wonderful.. at the end I really felt so French...so Harriet must be accurate in her description .. I thought the book was a delight to read and gave it to friends always so puzzled by the French. This book summarized the many conversations we constantly have as a family , I have 4 children in their 20's, about the differences the pros the cons of both societies. Bravo Harriet !"
4,Forget the rose-colored glasses,"I found the book a quick, entertaining read. I certainly didn't see any ""gender self-hatred,"" as one reviewer did. The author wasn't pretending to offer a comprehensive, social scientist's view of the whole of French society -- she just tells of what she's encountered in her 20+ years among the French. One thing I appreciated was that Madam Rochefort doesn't put the French up on a pedestal, as so many other books do (Entre Nous rather fits this category); she's honest and tells not only the admirable things, but also what still drives her crazy about the French. Chances are, that as people also raised in America, we might feel the same way."
3,too many drawbacks,"Maybe I'm just not smart enough to do these puzzles but some of them certainly require more detailed solutions than the ones offered or there isn't any point in having solutions. In addition there is way to much similarity in the puzzles, many of the so-called puzzles are more in the brain-teaser category (how can the purchaser of a parrot be dissatisfied if the parrot repeats every word it hears, as advertised?), at least one answer is either wrong or the problem is phrased improperly, some answers are impossible to comprehend (possibly just me again), there are some typos in the answers and finally there is no explication of some mathematical ""rules"" or ""laws"" that are used to justify answers.On the plus side the book is beautiful, user friendly, looks good on the coffee table and makes a great paper-weight/doorstop.If you like puzzles try Sam Loyd or Martin Gardner."
1,BUYER BEWARE!!!!!,"They claim that this is the 1946 release of THE BIG SLEEP. It is not. It is the original 1945 version, never released, and for good reason: it's not as good a movie. A DREADFUL MISLABELLING. Obviously they couldn't get the rights to the real thing and palmed this one off on unsuspecting viewers. Thank you TCM and thank you Amazon for really bad quality control."
2,dvd case arrives damaged,"The DVD itself is in good condition, but the dvd case arrived damaged. The center piece was broken and so the dvd slid around the inside. This did not cause damage during shipment (although it easily could have). My concern is that over the course of time this problem could cause damage as the dvd is used. The damaged case was a disappointment."
2,Not as good as remake with Jack Nicholas,My guess in this case was more creactivity used than original because of film era limiting sex sex scenes.
3,"Good DVD, Minor Characters Boosted Film","After several disappointing attempts at viewing this film on VHS, my patience was rewarded on the first viewing of it on this DVD. Maybe the clearer picture helped. At any rate, if someone else viewed this and found it boring - particularly the first half - I would understand but I finally found it interesting all the way through.Actually it was Hume Cronyn, not the stars of the film John Garfield and Lana Turner, who sparked my interest. He gave a fascinating portrayal of a lawyer and I wish his role had been bigger. Cecil Kellaway also is good as Tuner's husband, and I enjoyed Leon Ames as the district attorney.The film almost makes the two low-life leads into sympathetic characters, which is just plain wrong. Both Garfield and Turner's characters are morally bankrupt. Garfield even jokes early on in the film about how fooling around with another man's wife ""is nothing.""The ending was a bit strange but I thought was happened was appropriate."
5,TCM Greatest Classic Films collection,"I really love these movies...I first saw all of them at the moviesI also would like to say thanks to Gabe for sending my order in such a timely manner, and for the sweet note I found in my package.That means alot to me. Shows me you carethank youPhyllis Koenig"
3,Buyer Beware,"In spite of a special feature on The big Sleep DVD stating that the 1946 version is superior, the version we are given to view is the 1945 version. It seems weird that was done. The 1946 too expensive to be included?"
5,4 great classic Movies,"The Maltese Falcon, The Big Sleep, Dial M for Murder and the Postman always rings twice 1946 version. 4 Great iconic Hollywood Classic Movies with some of the Big stars ever to grace the silver screen. If you have seen these you will love this, if you haven't and want to discover what True Hollywood Classics are then this would be a great start for you. Great Picture and Audio makes this a must have for any Movie lover."
3,"Great movie, defective manufacturing.","Terrific film noir! I've been waiting for this movie to be released on DVD for many months. The video restoration is only fair-to-good and a movie of this caliber deserves a commentary, but the quality of the writing, acting, and direction of the film overrides these glaring deficiences of this video issue. The only problem is this DVD does not play on my DVD player. I have gone through 4 different replacements and the darn thing freezes and skips throughout the movie and special features. Warner Bros. is mum on the run of defects (or incompatibilities), but I have yet to get a hold of a disk that plays trouble free. If your player handles this disk without problems--enjoy!"
5,Unusual Detective,"If you like unusual and tense mysteries, you may want to try Raveling by Peter Moore Smith. The main character, Pilot James Aire, has recently been diagnosed with schizophrenia. As the schizophrenia takes hold Pilot becomes obsessed with the 20-year-old disappearance of his sister. He becomes determined to find the truth but is hampered by his brother, Eric, who considers him mentally ill. Helped by his therapist, Katherine DeQuincy-Joy, they search for the truth.The reader is never sure what is part of Pilot's psychosis and what are genuine memories and the suspense continues until the very end. This is not a book to recommend to ""cozy"" readers but is extremely engrossing and I highly recommend it. The audio version won an Audie award this year."
5,engrossing and smart,"Peter Smith's Raveling may be one of the finest mystery novels written in years. I found it unnerving, engrossing and with unusually good prose, particularly for a mystery book. A great work. I would recommend it to anyone."
5,Works beautifully,"I am a big fan of 2"" curling irons, but they can be difficult to find. My last one (different brand) wore out a couple years ago and I had a hard time finding a replacement until now.I have shoulder length hair, fairly thick, plus wavy and frizzy. 2"" curling irons do a great job of smoothing and straightening my hair, while also turning it under (or up, if desired) at the ends for a nice, finished look. I find it much easier and faster than using a traditional flat/straight iron while achieving superior results. You will not get ""curl"" with this curling iron. You will get smooth hair quickly and easily. Highly recommended."
3,Size Of Tube Pan,"What size is this pan 9 or 10""? Love to purchase but not much info, I need a 10"" pan."
4,It's Different,I picked up this watch because I thought it offered exceptional value for money considering its Swiss made. The yellow dial adds a touch of being different that the standard white/black/blue dials that are offered by most manufacturers. I have been happy with this buy... the dial size and thickness are generous. The date and crow at 4 o'clock position make interesting positioning. Victorinox engraved on the left hand case dia is unique and projects understated brand elegance. I have deducated one star because of the yellow strap that comes with the watch. It makes the watch look ordinary (rather cheap!). I have switched the strap to a blue coloured one which gives it a more sporty look. On the whole an excellent buy on the price:value equation.
1,DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM,"This item is not the same item that Tooltopia sends you. The advertised image is of a tintmeter that slides over an open window. The item I received was completely different. I received two separate parts used to measure tint, which is much different from the advertised image. BE AWARE!"
2,Amazon has technical problems,"The music is classic great Grateful Dead, but I cannot properly review it because the last few minutes of several songs just drop out. Amazon has technical problems with MP3 downloads to I-Tunes which they refuse to correct, so I'm using this forum to call attention to it. If you are an Apple I-Tunes user beware Amazon MP3s."
5,One of the Dead's best,"If their's any Grateful Dead album that is memorable, it's this one. Songs like ""Box of Rain, Friend of the Devil, Sugar Magnolia, Ripple"" are some of the Dead's finest. If your looking to start a collection of Grateful Dead cds, then you should probably start with this one."
1,ZZZzzzz!,"like man I put this disc on for my siameses cat Reggie and I swear to god he tried to gnaw through the radio plug, luckily I unplugged it. So I was all like "" What gives lil Reggie you don't feel the Dead?"" and he was all like licking his tail then he took a nap."
1,Terrible Message,"We checked this out of the library. It looked cute and we were expecting a message that each sibling has strong points. My children, who are on the small side anyway, thought this book sent a HORRIBLE message and felt completely disempowered by it. I can't think of a worse book or message, and we are avid readers. My kids are 5 and 7 years old."
2,Disapointing.,"I haven't read his first book.But, this one is disapointing.I got it used for 15 bucks at my local used book store, couldn't really browse it much because they were closing.Got it home and felt ripped off by the good reviews on this site (amazon).First of all, it gives short one paragraph reviews that give you no feel for the movie. You can't tell if the reviewer likes or hates the movie. And as for the blurbs on the front that tell you how funny it is, I don't see much humor in these reviews. They are short and stale.Plus there is a lot of filler reviews. Why review movies like Cape Fear, when it is reviewed in just about every mainstream video guide out there?Are these movies in here just to give weight to his definition of Psychotronic? I feel ripped off.I would recommend DVD Delirium. This book is much more fun and you can really get a feel for the movie. Plus the reviewers let you know if they liked the movie or not. It's a lot of fun and hard to put down."
4,Do this only if you REALLY want to sweat........,"Because boy does she really keep the pace going!!! Other reviews mentioned that it is hard to see all the moves. I have to say, it is best to sit down and just watch the video first before you try it. Don't be afraid to rewind a bit and watch it again till you get the moves right. This is a calorie burner, no question about it. I only do this one when I want a bit of a pick me up, so I don't do it often. When I do this one, I do feel terrific and accomplished. One of those feelings like, HEY, I didn't fall on my butt this time!!!! Hooray! All of the music is Paula Abdul music, so if you like her music, you will love this work out video."
2,fast instruction,"this is a great video for the younger people or the older ones who are in shape and want to stay that way. i love to dance and am looking forward to working up to this. the step by step instructions are too quickly presented after moving on to the next. maybe its my age and for sure im out of shape, so im saving this one for later."
1,Not for Begginers,I thought... hey lets give this a try.. I had never worked out at all ever and was needing to do something after the baby was about a year to help loose weight!If this fits u..try the belly bance for begginers.. slower paced way better!
4,LOVE THIS VIDEO!!!,"This video is sooooo much fun! Finally, a dance video that IS actually dance-oriented but also makes you sweat! Please don't give up on this....I also felt really frustrated at first, and I would stop the tape every now and then(I have miminal dance experience). However, after about three or four days of doing the tape, I had gotten the steps down, and now I'm adding my own flavor and feeling like a real dancer! And it is soooo much fun, Paula and her group are encouraging and sweet, and even though I have done it a ton of times, I always have a blast and look forward to doing it. Plus, it is a GREAT workout...I am soaked in sweat by the end of it. For those who complained that it didn't really target the abs, etc....this is a cardio video, not a toning one! My only complaint is that while the music and dance moves are fun, they are a little outdated. This is a fun video though...buy it!"
4,"It May Be Old-School, but THAT'S DANCIN!!!","I am a seasoned amateur dancer, former aerobics instructor from the 80's and an avid connoisseur of dance workout videos which makes me a critical reviewer. All I've got to say is: MOMMA MIA! THAT'S A SPICY WORKOUT! I LOVE THIS!!!Paula is a TRUE professional, guiding you through the steps of the workout seamlessly with her energetic style. You do the steps at slow-medium-then fast, which is the best way to learn for most students. The workout is perfectly paced, just like a real dance class so you get a slammin' warm up, a jammin cardio session with jazzy choreography and a soothing cooldown that makes you feel like a dancer. Were this 1995, I would have given this vid a 5-star rating. The moves and music definitely date it but, ya know what? NOBODY'S gunna be looking at you dancing like an Old-Schooler because you are in your own living room doin' the moves. Okay so Paula....WHEN are you gunna do a new version?? I am dying for more!"
2,this is aerobics not dance,I was looking for a fun dance tape and this is not it.......this is a new aerobics routine.
1,Way too complicated,"This is the most complicated workout I've ever tried. Unfortunately, it was one of the first fitness videos I ever bought... at the time I thought that was why I couldnt' follow it. But, now I have been working out for a year and still can't follow Paula. The music is good, but the steps don't make sense and on top of it all ... it sure doesn't feel like you are getting any kind of workout at all. The only good thing I can say is ... the warm up and cool down are all right. I've been known to just do those and do some other kind of exercise in between as I fast forward."
5,Awesome!,"This CD is actually a re-release of an old album not from the TV series but actually from a spin-off movie. The TV series is titled, ""The Six Wives of Henry VIII"". The movie was called ""Henry VIII & His Six Wives"" (which, unfortunately, was never released on video or DVD here in the states, but may be one day). Regardless, this music from the film is a wonderful example of Tudor and Elizabethan music played on authentic instruments by on of the greatest early music scholars and musicians, the late David Munrow. This is an excellent CD for fans of early music and anyone who wants to experience the true sounds of the period."
4,Slick!,I got this as a gift and had my first attempt. Used earl Grey tea and blackberry's to infuse. While the berry's didn't work very well it was slick! For sure would only use fruits that are sliced. Overall very happy!
2,Not the greatest...,"I have had this pitcher for about a year. The other reviews are pretty accurate. It is not balanced properly, the holes are too big for most whole leaf tea and it is an awkward shape. It can be convenient for brewing iced tea using bagged tea.Overall it is pretty cheap (quality wise). I would pass."
4,Bodum Ceylon iced tea maker & infusion,"With summer here in the Arizona desert, we're already drinking lots of iced tea. I purchased the larger of the sizes offered and it just barely fits in the fridge....but it fits. It's handy since it's oblong shape. We are able to use loose tea and tea bags. However, loose tea isn't so readily available at regular grocery stores so tea bags will be the norm. Cutting up a whole orange or lemon and ""fusing"" that with the tea does make the tea taste yummy. It's not glass so not so heavy when filled to the top."
3,"A Lot of Good Information, But Biased","In many ways my review echoes those of others. I learned a lot about the Reformation that I did not know and found it more devisive between ""Reformed"" and ""Lutheran"" than I have understood from my past learning. That being said, I find the author's bias becomes very visible toward the end. I have found it difficult to finish the last 150 pages as I become more frustrated with unneccessary adjectives that show the author's bias against reformers and towards the moderate Anglican church, especially against the Puritans and Presbyterians. I believe he could have been more objective and put himself more in tune with the perspective of the people at the time. He tries to do this, but comes up short.Overall, I give the book three stars because there is a lot of good information in the book."
4,Works well.,"I prefer the SanDisk memory as I've never ever had a SanDisk card go bad, but this one was a good deal. I'll have to report later on how well it stands up to heavy use (plugging in and out of a digital camera etc)."
3,Not as good as his other novels,"I began the book with very high hope after reading and enjoying his other books, but I must say it was very hard keep on reading, because the ending was just so predictable. I couldn't really understand what that main character's problem was like the other reviewer had said. And from all of Sparks' book, I would said I wouldn't have mind not reading it. If you want the excitement of fire fighting love story, read Nicholas Evans' new novel, The Smoke Jumper. That story is more exciting and heart wrenching than this book. And you could understand why the characters act the way they does, which I couldn't do with Sparks' novel here."
2,Simple and unsubstantial.,"I credit the author for pulling me in to the story up until the last 50 pages or so. It reads like a made for tv movie with short sentences and simple words. I kept reading though, simply wanting to know what Tyler's problem was. Then I decided I didn't really care and left it. The plot is oversimplified and the author counts on pulling the heartstrings of the reader through the circumstances of the characters, and idealistic ideas about romantic love rather than through meaty and intelligent writing. This book is fluffy beach reading. If that's what you're into you'll probably like it but if you want a book of real substance that doesn't insult your intelligence with it's simplified, formulaic style, pick up something else."
4,The Perfect Start,"This was the first Nicholas Sparks book that I read, and I was hooked. The Rescue hooks you right from the start."
5,Great BOok,This is the First book of Nicholas Sparks I ever read and it was wonderful one of those hard to put down books . I highly recommend this book
1,Writer in a duck-blind,"Easy for a writer to fill page after page with boring repetitions. I failed to see a romance here. I tried and tried to find an interesting development, but page after page I did not get out of the duck blind. My suspicion is that an industrious but dull-witted woman typed this book, not Nicholas but Nicole. It is a sad tragedy, but I stay away from books written by my own gender."
1,Thoroughly Disappointed,"Nicholas Sparks has a history of writing tender romance with twists of fate, unforgettable characters, and surprise endings. This book is formulaic, dull, and predictable. It's nothing more than a sweet romance, likeable on its own only if one is not expecting the quality of Sparks' previous offerings. I kept waiting for the surprise found in each of the author's previous books; in this one it never materialized. I hope he hasn't sold out to the idea of simply pumping out more fiction in a hurry; I would rather wait a few years for a novel of the quality Sparks gave us with his previous books."
1,Don't waste your time,"This book will insult the intelligence of anyone with more than a third grade education. It has a good premise, and likeable, if shallow characters, but it is written poorly. The plot is transparent, issues are oversimplified, and the writing style is particularly insulting. The author uses parentheticals to explain what he is writing about, as if the reader weren't smart enough to be able to figure it out. I am writing this anonymously because I wouldn't want anyone to know that I actually read this drivel."
2,Rescue is not his best,"I have enjoyed reading N. Sparks books since his first release and looked forward to his next but after this read, I stopped. Even though his books are predicatable, they are enjoyable reads as I like his style but this one was boring."
4,Touching and Emotional,Follow along as a man and a woman fall in love and change each other's lives through daring each other to live life to the fullest and daring to love. The Rescue is a touching story that shows how to open up and proves when the time is right for love it will be standing at your doorstep. The Rescue makes you think about your own life and ask yourself if you are living you life to the fullest. This book is a passionate love story that brings the aspects of loving a child and the love of lovers to your mind. It opens your mind to the idea that there is someone special out there for everyone and when they are suppose to be found they will. The Rescue makes you want to dare to fall in love and leaves you with a great feeling after reading it. Nichloas Sparks is a great writer and pulls at your heartstrings with this novel. He writes emotional stories that allow you to relate to the character and understand what the characters are going through.
2,Corny as a bowl of mush,"If there's a southern man as head-in-the-clouds romantic as the hero of this book I'll eat my straw hat. Most of this book is dripping with descriptions of the mind-boggling ""beauty and strength"" of the heroine. She's beautiful this way, and also that way, on and on and on and on. Author obviously hasn't spent any time around the southern volunteer fireman I know."
3,A Good Story,"The Rescue, a novel by Nicholas Sparks, was loaned to my husband. I picked it up and was hooked on it in no time at all. This romantic story is action packed with drama revolving around volunteer firemen at great risk. The three main characters are: Denise, a single mother, never married, her developmentally delayed son, Kyle, and a charming and kind hero named Taylor. It's a good story and well told.I gave it three stars because - although it is listed as New York Times Bestseller it does not compare to a book like The Help."
5,One of my fav Sparks books,Another good one from N. Sparks. Happier ending than some of his books. Still wish he would learn the concept of 'happily ever after'! ;-)
4,A Close Knit Community,"The Rescue written by Nicholas Sparks shows many different views and aspects of life. There are two very hard scenarios within the novel that are hard to overcome but it is overcome through hardwork and perseverance. There are many adversities between two families, and both of those families are able to come together and help each other out during the times of crisis. Both of the families are part of this little town, and both share some unique adventures. If you would like to find out what they discover, and you would like to find out what the advertisities and the obstacles are that face someone with a disability, and of a firefighter, then this book is for you. Nicholas does a wonderful job of combining these two families together, that once the first couple of chapters were finished in the book, it was very hard to put down the rest of the book until finding out what happened at the end. This is a thrilling and very exciting book and also a exhilirating book."
4,ENTERTAINING,"I NEVER PUT THE BOOK DOWN ONCE I BEGAN READING. GREAT ENTERTAINMENT.HIGHLY RECOMMEND FOR ANY READER THAT ENJOYS ROMANCE, AND INTENSITY"
2,Not Bad,"I use ""The Notebook"" and ""A Walk to Remember"" as optional films in my upper division sociology courses. After hearing many positive student responses, I was curious about Sparks as an author--one of the few males writing commercially successful romance novels. After a slow start with ""True Believer,"" I was more satisfied with ""The Rescue."" Taylor's friendship with Mitch and his emotional growth add dimension to an otherwise standard tale of boy meets girl, etc., etc.,"
5,Loved the book,"This is a fantastic book, easy to read and kept my interest all the way through. Nicholas Sparks is one of my favorite authors. I have read almost all of his books."
4,Great!,It was a great book...although it kind of left me wanting more. Still i liked it...im never disappointed with Nicholas Sparks!
1,Not enough and not properly organized,"I particularly bought this book for MOM 2005 setup\configuration and found that this book wasn't I expected to be. First, it doesn't go deep in explaining configuration of management packs. Second, it is poorly organized. Author is jumping back and forth between configuration topics and that is very annoying. If your goal is to learn MOM 2005 thoroughly then your money is well spent somewhere else. It is better to read Microsoft documentation on MOM 2005 than this book. The book is simply too small to cover all three topics."
5,"My first thought was ""Did they make a mistake?"", then I ""got it.""","My sister just sent this to me for my birthday. I actually thought it was a mistake and wondered how she could have not noticed it. Ha! I must be a bit slow. Anyway, this is hilarious and a perfect gift book to pass on and on from one friend to the next, especially for a milestone birthday like 40 or 50. We have to laugh at this point in our lives, right?"
5,WWIII - self-titled (Hollywood Records),"I remember back when this CD first got a good amount of airplay on Z-Rock. As I know I still have my cassette copy of this title - do the labels even still manufacture cassettes? Amazed it still plays as I've listened to this WWIII tape plenty of times. Head-riveting tunes like their ace-in-the hole '90's metal (possibly anthem) ""Time For Terror"", the rocking ""Love You To Death"", their T. Rex cover ""Children Of The Revolution"", awesome ""Atomic Sex Appeal"" and ""Drive You Crazy"" fully reminded me of just why I liked WWIII so much back in the day. I got to see them (at least vocalist Mandy Lion) with a three-piece back-up band play a dive not too long ago. Mandy Lion was great to hang out with. Line-up: Mandy Lion - vocals, Tracy G. - guitar, Jimmy Bain - vass and Vinny Appice - drums. What? So, they're like Dio with a new vocalist? A must-have for loyal fans of Motorhead, Judas Priest, Black Sabbath, Exciter - the list goes on."
4,The MAN of IBIZA,"Nacho is one of the best Mediterranean Electronic Chillout artist.He is working on different series and LA ROCA it's one of the most popular (anyway i suggest also to take in consideration The Dome series).In the number five there are more spanish influence than before, ethnic is mixed with electronic trance and a little thecno (very impressive FRONTERAS).All the songs are new exept Aire already present in others session.I suggest for the people that likes Cafe del Mar."
4,An Historic Project,"The Foxfire Project is momentious and if you notice you are missing one or three in the set, having loaned them, it's wise to replace these missing gems of mountain pioneering and lossed skills. Mighty fine reading next to the bed."
5,2 1/2 yr old loves this animated DVD,"Another review explains everything on the DVD. I just wanted to add this is an animated DVD, not a narrated one. Thomas and friends actually do the talking in the videos, not just narration. My 2 1/2 yr old has watched the short segments over and over. There are only 4, but he still loves them. Worth the price."
1,"Stay away from NA311, can't say on FA311TX","This is the closest area I could write about the Netgear FA311. You CAN'T use it. On a simple network with 3 computers and a SMC hub, it either locked my computer or made my computer reboot consistently. I thought it was conflicting with my modem - took that out and did no good. I thought maybe it was the hub.Just added Earthlink to the house with a Netgear RP614 Router (THAT ROUTER DEFINITELY ROCKS:)), the cable modem and the other 2 pcs and the card STILL locked up my pc. I replaced the card with an old 3COM Soho card - no problems. I had all 3 computers (2 win98 and 1xp home all with 3com network cards with a motorola cable modem) running with smooth sailing. If you need a good network card, try 3COM."
5,Very easy for novice networkers!,"I had never done anything more complex than installing RAM and a 56K modem before this and this was a breeze. You do have to know how to remove the cover on your CPU and be reasonably familiar with the guts of your PC, but not much more than that. The software, where these things tend to fall down, installed flawlessly. On one of my PCs, the screens matched the documentation exactly and on the other, it was close enough for me to figure out. Tonight I am tackling my Netgear RT-314 DSL/Cable router and hopefully, I have the same success"
2,Watch the registry!,"I'm semi-computer illiterate, but installing the card was a breeze, and it seems to work fine ... but! When I installed the driver, being careful to follow all the instructions, I found it had corrupted files that were referred to in the registry. As it happened I didn't need the files, but now whenever I boot up I get the infamouse blue screen and will have to get the registry fixed."
2,WARNING,"Some of these cards were shipped with the wrong EEPROM resulting in the drivers not being recognized. I learned of this from Netgear's technical support after I spent a couple of hours trying to get it to work. You have to go to Netgear's web site and download S/W to correct the problem. If you are not comfortable with this, avoid this card. I use this card to connect my PC to a DSL modem. My DSL connection is slow. I don't know if this card is the reason by it is suspect."
3,"Good reference, bad primer","This book is well-organized and thorough, but I feel that the only things that allowed me to benefit from it were (1) having studied the language in Hebrew school as a child, and (2) haivng a Master's degree in linguistics and experience learning many different languages.. Unless you are familiar with notions like declension, conjugation, mood, and aspect, using this book will seem like learning one foreign language via another. But if you have some background in Latin or Greek, you can pick up fair amount from this book in a relatively short time."
5,Def Leppard + Faith No More,"That's how somebody somewhere (was it Metal Hammer back in the day when Metal Hammer was METAL Hammer?) described this, and, while it's a hawk-eyed observation, even that comparison to great music such as Leps and FNM doesn't do justice to T-Ride, because they have their own very special thing going. Through the wonder of internet, I became acquainted with this outstanding but toooo short-lived band. By the GODS, what a hugely original AND great album! Tight to the extreme, well-crafted songs, full of brilliant melodies...and the lyrics are something every aspiring songwriter should take a look at. I beg the guys from T-Ride to make a COMEBACK! And everyone with even the slightest interest for great music to check this orchestra out. And now, to my endless joy, I see that Amazon actually HAS it in stock! For a change! Galáctico. Dad......DAD!!!! Ahem, the crrrredit card, thank you very much...."
3,worth a look,"It is neither great nor bad, and there always are a few gems.For instance, his interpretation of Elvis is a hoot,and someboday had to say it!"
1,Don't Waste Your Time If You Are A Beginner,"The arrogance of the writing is the salient feature here. Presuming that the reader is able to effortlessly follow complex topics, the author seems to be too content to create an elaborate display of his own intelligence in the subject matter without making sure that the proper foundations are laid for any sense of comprenhension for those who may be left behind. It is obvious that Kramer does indeed know the material, yet his prose is often caught up in its own self-indulgence."
4,Tip & Toot Tractor,"My 2-1/2 year-old grandson loved the tractor and has seen the movie twice. He liked just being able to push it around and play ""farming""."
5,A World of Difference,"This pan is great for homemade pizza. The crust browns on the bottom without burning on the top. It's easy to clean, too."
4,Suspensful!,The Cleaner was a very good movie. It was suspenseful and I always enjoy watching Samuel Jackson in movies.
3,Good size,This balm has a mild scent. The bottle is very classy and the sizing is neither to big nor to small.
2,Hardly a cookbook,"This ""book"" is a bit of a joke. Very small, mushroom-shaped, and the text is written in very large letters such that each recipe takes two pages. In the 100 pages it has there are probably less than 50 recipes, mostly standard ones with mushrooms added. Looks more like someone's pulled out all the recipes with mushrooms from a regular cookbook. There are much better cookbooks out there for the true mushroom lover."
5,SCREAM (OUT LOUD),"I bought this tape (yes I said Tape) back when it first came out in 1991. It was one of my favorites and I could never understand why it did not get much attention. John Corabi has an absolutly amazing voice. Every song on the ablum rocks, from the opener 'Outlaw' to my personal favorite 'Man in the Moon' to the end with 'Catch me if you can'. When I say if rocks..... I mean it will rock your... you know what.. off. And I can't believe that in all the reviews for John's current band Union- no one mentions The Scream!!!!! He is referred to as the 'former frontman of the CRUE???? They do not know what they are missing. So now I am very happy to see that this album has been re-released- DO NOT HESITATE to BUY NOW!!!!!!!"
4,Interesting,"While this book does come across as a list of products I did find the information interesting. I do however question some of the analyst of this book particularly the ""energy"" given off by plants captured by photography."
3,Kind of confusing..kind of informing..,"This book is strange..It attempts to show you how eating certain foods increase beauty..but it left me confused. Maybe because I knew very little about his ideology and way of speaking. I wouldnt call this book strait forward. If you know this author and like him, you will most likely like this book. If your new to him like me..I would look for something else."
3,LOTS OF ICE WITH LITTLE FIRE,"I BOUGHT THIS ALBUM USED AND WAS KIND OF DISSA- POINTED. IT HAS ALL THE GUITAR YOU HAVE COME TO EXPECT FORM THE LEGEND. BUT THIS ALBUM LACKS ENERGY IN LOTS OF SONGS. ITS GOT 'TEASER' WHICH IS A TOO LATE POP-METAL SONG. ITS WEAK. YOULL THINK YOU HEARD IT BEFORE. THE BEST SONGS ARE 'ALL I WANT', 'FOREVER ISA LONG TIME', 'C'EST LA VIE', AND ' IM MY OWN ENEMY'. WHA TI REALLY LIKE THE BEST IS THE ARTWORK! IT LEADS YOU TO BELIEVE THIS ALBUM IS HOT. WEL ITS NOT THAT MUCH. BUT IF YOU LIKE THE NEO-CLASSIC METAL AND LIKE EXPIERMENTAL-PROGRESSIVE AND NOT FULL THROTTLE SONGS,GET IT ! ELECTRA DROPPED HIM AFTER THIS ALBUM. HIS BEST DAYS WHERE THE ALBUMS ODYSSEY AND ECLIPSE WITH NONE STOP PEDAL TO THE METAL GUITAR."
3,And the drama goes on,"Former Admiral Varl Tarl Sogan believed his whole family destroyed in the purge that followed his conviction to death for refusing to obey the direct order of destroying a planet. But the small Arcturian force stranded on a perilous planet that enslaved the population is from a ship that Sogan knows his cousin commanded. And as Sogan himself is a telepath, this cousin that controls the minds of his subjects is not a complete surprise. The thing is - Sogan has to help the commando team destroy the rogue army - and that will mean the destruction of his last relative alive.I grew to really like Sogan, but sometimes his mental stress seems over-extended. So i may grade some of the books in the series lower than I'd usually do, just because unrelenting psychic pain makes me mad, and the refusal of the character to grow out of that state of mind is annoying. Other than that, the books are very enjoyable. Recommended."
5,good deal,pretty spiffyplan to mount by the front door to provide light for getting the key in the door in the dark
1,Junk,"I don't understand the positive reviews of this item. I opened two and only one worked which was enough for me to send them all back. They are the size of TV remotes, cheap plastic, and the lens breaks the light up into very spotty bands. The batteries may last a while, but they aren't included and you'll likely spend as much buying them, 4 AAAs per light!"
1,"AWFULL CD, Boring.",The Word evolution does not exixt in the Luis Miguel dictionary this album is boring and sound the same like all his music.He needs to learn about Ricky Martin that always surprise us with a good album.
5,QRM Student Review,This book is a) very readable b) flows logically c) covers a LOT of material d) makes a great resource for writing a QRM proposal e) is a great resource when planning and executing a qualitative study. A MUST have for the new student and makes an excellent text for an intro class.
2,Disappointing,I guess maybe my expectations were too high for what is supposed to be an $80 pan. Feels cheap and light. Cooking surface is full of imperfections - actual chunks of teflon on the surface. I think I am going to return this one.
5,Excellent pan for stove and oven,"We bought this pan about two months ago and use it almost every day. The nonstick coating is wonderful and food literally slides around inside the pan - even eggs with little or no oil.I thought I would miss having a long handle to grab onto, but after using it for over a month I must say the two handle arrangement is great. You can lift it easily with two hands when it's full of heavy things like fried potatoes or spaghetti and it fits easily into the oven.The glass lid is a really nice feature, as it allows you to see what you're cooking. The handles on the pan and the lid get warm, but not hot when cooking on the stovetop. Obviously, you need to use a mitt if you put the pan in the oven. Both the pan and lid are a breeze to clean also.Overall, I can't think of a negative aspect of this pan/lid combo. I'd buy it again in a second!"
1,JUNK!,"Arrived with the handle separated from the lid. After using it about four times on medium to medium high heat, the whole pan turned into a bowl! Could they possibly use thinner metal for the bottom of this pan? Too bad, cause I really liked all the other pots and pans I have bought from Cuisinart--those all have a heavy thick bottom on them, unlike this thing..+-"
1,Poorly made.. I dont know what everyone is talking about!,"Wow.. where to begin.Well - i wont get into specifics, but lets just say im not lost in a kitchen and leave it at that.I bought this on a special sale amazon was having and it was a mistake.I started using this and noticed all the oil pooled in the center. i thought i was imagining things so i picked it up and noticed it was very bowed from looking at the bottom. First use after hand washing.. and its bowed before i can even really cook with it!! The handles felt very very weak and the actual non stick surface was aweful.ill stick to my lodge logic."
3,A big pan,We haven't used the pan yet. We planned to replace a Calphalon everyday pan but find it too big to use everyday. It's more like a paella pan. Thickness is thinner than I'd like. We'll use it but not as often a we thought.
4,Chef's Pan,"Cuisinart 625-30D Chef's Classic Nonstick PanNice pan. Not very heavy, but still my ""go-to"" pan for many things. It's the first time I had purchased a pan without a traditional long handle, and I love it! Why have something sticking out over the stove that you don't really need? After all... we don't cook over an open fire very often any more! So far the non-stick properties work well. I WILL re-review in the future if/when that changes!"
4,NICE PAN MAY BE A LITTLE WARM TO HANDLE,I LOVE EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS PAN EXCEPT THE HANDLES GET TO WARMEVEN ON MEDIUM HEAT. I FEEL THE HANDLES ARE TOO LIGHT TO DISSIPATETHE HEAT. THE COOKING SURFACE ON THIS PAN IS IMPRESSIVE. I USETHIS PAN ALMOST EVERY DAY AND I USE STEEL SPATULAS BECAUSE I HATEPLASTIC ONES AND THIS SURFACE IS HOLDING UP AS PROMISED. THE LIDIS HIGH QUALITY AND I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS PAN TO ANYONE THATDOES'NT MIND USING A GLOVE OR POT HOLDER.
4,"VERY versatile, works great, but feels a little cheap","My other cookware is usually nicer than this, but I had a really hard time finding something of this form-factor. With limited space, I cannot afford to have a large pan-handle sticking out, so I like that this pan has small handles on the sides. Not only does this take up less space, it also makes it easier to carry. I am really glad I bought this. It is so versatile since it's very wide (like pans), and reasonably deep (like pots). It has replaced several different pots and pans for me. It will be the only pan/pot I use in 99% of cases now, and this is especially helpful since I don't have that much space in my kitchen. That said, it has its faults. It is light weight to the point of feeling a little cheap. The lid doesn't fit securely. None of this takes away from the utility, though, and that is what counts for me. I am looking forward to using this a lot. Let's see how it holds up."
4,Good pan for the price...,"This pan just arrived and I've already given it a test run. The non-stick is beautiful and everything slides right off with just the barest hint of olive oil. The main con of the pan is this: if you are used to high end cookware, this pan will seem a little...flimsy. It's really quite lightweight compared to some other brands of hard anodized. On the other hand, the current price of $25 is a steal so one can hardly complain. Just don't order this thinking it has the heft of a Calphalon commercial or even Anolon Advanced--it doesn't, but the price is much, much less. Anyway, cooks beautifully and I'm sure it would have the same life-span as other non-stick (which, for me, is somewhere around two years--I don't baby things)."
4,"TOLM is a must read twice, and a reference forever","For those serious about going within, meditating or connecting to spirit and their higher self TOLM will systematically take you there.I've done my initial reading and am awaiting the next full moon to begin the 21 day process."
2,Cingular service is awful,"More dropped calls than any service I have had in the last 7 years. Sound quality is awful no matter which handset I try, and I have tried 3+ different handsets. Seems to be that they are trying to use some sort of automatic gain control or just poor compression - words are clipped making conversations difficult to understand. The first 2 bills were messed up and, though they ended up making it right in the end, it took a few calls each time and the customer service reps were far from friendly."
5,You Can't Go Wrong with Mr. Putter & Tabby Books!,Enjoy each and every Mr. Putter and Tabby books are they are treasures! and great reads!
5,No Surprise!,"I have all the titles in the series, and of course, I love this one. My children snuggle up and we have read this one overand over. A must have for Mr. Putter and Tabby fans. Everyone will love the warmth and consideration from Mr. Putters neighbor and her dog, zeke. We should all care so much."
4,So much you can do with your family,It gives lots of ideas where you can go with your family but not what you can do as a family inside of your own home. It also has great tips such as planning and writing stuff down on a calendar or in a notebook. What I didn't like about this book was there was some infomation that wasn't even related to family fun.
4,One Song,"I'm not saying there's only one good song on this album, but most of the best tracks are widely available. This was worth the purchase just for Franco Battiato's cover of Ruby Tuesday. When I saw the film that was the one piece of music that really stuck with me (along with John Lennon's Bring On The Lucie). It's just a beautiful and slightly haunting track with lovely harmony.The rest of the album; starts strong (Deep Purple), ends strong (Lennon), a few mediocre tracks. Depending on what you've got in your collection you might just want to download a few tracks instead of getting the whole CD, but overall it works well as a complete record and invokes some of the same gritty, cross-cultural uncertainty that the film does, which is the mark of a good soundtrack."
1,A Disappointing Book,"For God and Country purports to be a work of fiction. W.E.B Griffin, it is not. The story line is thinly scattered throughout a jumble of facts - some dramatically wrong. For example, a map of Betio has the island running essentially North-South instead of more East-West. The M-1 is characterised as prone to jamming and inaccurate when hot due to barrel heat which would have been a surprise to MacArthur and Patton who praised it highly. The book is one big chapter, disjointed with sentence structure that would make an English teacher blush. The spelling, punctuation and verbless incomplete sentences make it hard to read. This is definitely one to miss."
1,90% cr*p,"I hope the author of this book didn't take his work too seriously; this is just a book for laughs as far I'm concerned. 95% of this book is useless and time-wasting. It should have been called ""Hardly Working at College: The Idiot's guide to barely or not graduating at all"". And I didn't by this book, I wouldn't be dumb enough to, I got it as a gag gift."
3,LIFT Ratings Are VERY important,"So, when buying torsion springs it is good to know your approximate lift rating of the spring. this spring here, 1""3/4"" ID, .243 at 32"" gives like 137 lbs of lift (per ddm garage doors 'find my springs' database...) what this means is if you use two, you get a combined 274lbs of lift. (assuming 12"" radius on the track apparently), which means if your garage door weighs 162lbs, you're well over by about 100lbs. this means your garage door which wouldn't open now is very open, and won't close. unless you ahve two people exert 112lbs of downward force on it to hold it closed. trust me. I know. and now you know. (the .250 wire diameter 32"" 1""3/4""id springs give like 158 lbs of lift(x2=300+lbs of lift) must be a heavy door.)... and the other set around here the .218 20"" which in the description says it gives 100lbs of lift.. which x2 is still close to too much lift for a residential 2 car aluminum garage door."
2,Superhero with Human Problems,"This book starts off at the point where Hal Jordan, ex-Green Lantern of sector 2814, had decided to give up being a Green Lantern (GL). He decided that being a GL had severely affected his personal life, and thus decided to start a normal life. However, Guy Gardner, another GL, is sore that he is Earth's GL only because Hal gave up the responsibility. Thus he keeps disrupting Hal's new life, and refuses to leave Hal alone. Things take a turn for the worse when a crazy Guardian decided to start his own collection of cities from around the universe. The book focuses a lot on Hal's thoughts, about the choices he has made, and what he wants out of his life. I would not recommend this book, unless one is into heavy issues in life."
5,A Full Five Stars Rating For This Flamenco Guitar CD !!,"When I received this CD I sat on it for awhile, because I had several others I wanted to listen to first. I should have played this one FIRST. Hypnotic Safari is an exceptional work by some very talented musicians. I always liked flamenco guitar music, but this is the best I've ever heard. I truly enjoyed each track on the CD. Every song is super, and worth listening to over and over. If you're relaxing, reading the paper or working around the house, you can still enjoy this effort. If you've never tried flamenco guitar, try this CD. Believe me, it's infectious. Add it to your collection, you'll enjoy it !!"
2,@Risk Simulation for IT Project,"This book makes sense to IT project or very samll, simple and non-complex construction projects when more sophiscated and expensive analysis tools could not be afforded. For large Oil & Gas or mega construction projects, this book is somewhat misleading. I bought the book hoping to find a model which will help me analyze project cost estimate / schedule uncertainty, therefore establish the contingency as well as risk response plan, I was quite disappointed paying over $100 for this 140-page booklet."
5,"Great hat, worth twice this amount","Received the hat and was very pleased. The hat itself looks nothing like the hat shown. It is a brown, padded hat, not thin and black as shown in the photo but despite this, the overall effect is really great. The hat easily sprung into shape and was very comfortable. The attached bandana helps to make the thing work. The braids are actually thicker than shown , more like Jack Sparrow's and there are not a lot of them but enough to cover the head and look great since the hat comes down on the head. Overall, I am very pleased with this purchase. I will try to include a photo of the actual hat we received."
1,don't waste your money,"Okay, first of all this hat is NOT the one in the picture. Notice the size in the picture? This hat is at least 1/2 of that size. Notice the color? This is not the color it was when i purchase it.Even the bralds and beads are not the same and is very chessy. The hat in the picture is, without a doubt, not the same one this company ships and i wanted to return it the company they give me a rma number. It will cost me as much to ship it back than I will get credit for., So I lose any way I look at it. This company dosen't made the product I understands that. If someone at this company will put the hat on there own head. they would see what the problem is."
4,Good product,This was a good product for the price. The board looks good and is made out of a nice wood. The pieces were all in good condition and it even came with a few extra.
5,Family re-defined,"This was a movingly written, sad, but ultimately life-affirming book. It put me in mind of Elizabeth Berg's ""Talk Before Sleep"" in its depiction of a family being those who care, not necessarily those related by blood. As one reviewer said...""the family you are born with and the family you make"". With well-developed characters, the book explored some larger-than-life ideas.Summer is a former ballerina, injured and no longer able to dance, who is called home to Ohio to help care for her brother, stricken with AIDS. The story begins as he enters the final months of his life. He, his life partner, Summer, and a young nursing student who lives with them become a family in every sense of the word.Kittle's depiction of the course of the disease and its aftermath are so authentic that the reader soon realizes that the author must have had some personal experience with a fatal disease.This is a most worthwhile book."
5,My favorite book of all time!!,"I actually read this book about 5 years ago and felt, at that time, that it was one of the best books I had ever read. Even though I never re-read books I decided to buy this book for my Kindle and re-read it. This is such a well written tender love story. It does not disappoint! Loved reading it again, and definitely a keeper!!"
3,Too many plot lines to finish them all,"Contrived characters and untethered plot lines.Summer's parents often go missing during her childhood. Why? Yet later they come across as supportive role models. Jacob hasn't communicated with his parents for years, then his mother shows up at Christmas, hedging questions about the whereabouts of his father, and she's never heard from again. Was there a point to this? A homophobic caller leaves messages and this plot line, too, is left hanging. Moving descriptions of AIDs related death are well done but otherwise characters are not fully formed. Abby is an abused wife, everyone knows it and yet no one lifts a finger to help her. I'd avoid this author in the future."
1,Remastered?,"I assumed that remastered meant colored, like the picture on the front. No so, apparently, it's still black and white."
4,Great Death Metal Album,"Entombed are Gods , masters of swedish metal , you have to listen this albumHM"
4,Almost all of the best,"I have vintage copies of the first 3 albums of Klaatu (3:47, Hope and Sir Army Suit. I also owned a Capitol squish CD of 3:47 and Hope. The music presented in this mix is the most of the best that they have produced. The music clarity is unpresidented. It appears they took the orginal tracks and used them for this release, not the Capitol mix. The only tracks missing that also represent some more of the best are: Mr. Manson, Prelude, Long Live Politzania, Silly Boys, Sell Out Sell Out, A Million Miles Away, and Magentaline.I hope they will release these also soon, or their later albums presented in the same way."
3,Poor quality,The images in this manual are of such poor quality that it is almost useless when it comes to disassembling or assembling an SKS. Save your money and get one free from the internet. You can print only those pages that you need.
4,"Intriguing, where's the rest?","An excellent book for all people interested in Laing. Hopefully Mullan will find a way to publish the material so that those interested can read it rather than holding onto it and waiting for a publishing deal that isn't too far ""beneath"" his expectations."
4,Quick Read on the Basics of Sales,"Straight talk. It's a good read - like a summary reminder of good sales practice. A sales person is someone how brings value - saves time and money for the customer by giving expert advice on what needs to be done. They need to know what clients buy and why - this helps them to make sure their client gets the best possible value - not necessary a price cut. Who is a client? Someone to whom you are indispensable. That means, having a greater share of a customer's budget makes that customer a client - not just a one time customer. You are indispensable. You add value hence the investment and greater share of investment compared to other salespeople. This was good learning. It talks a lot about goal setting in the beginning and the importance of visualizing yourself to be successful."
1,Cheap Bands,I bought the ripcord exercise bands around three weeks ago for a light workout once a week to replace the weight training. After the third time using the green band it snapped while I was using correct form. I have to be grateful that when it snapped it only hit me in the leg and not the face. After that I decided to compare it to another brand and saw how poorly and cheap the ripcord bands were made. I called Ripcords and they will make good on my purchase by refunding me.
5,be afraid -- be VERY afraid (if you're a pizza!),"it's BIGit's SHARPhoweverit's CONSIDERATE, i.e., it's not as heavy or as unwieldy as it looks, it features a finger guard design which helps protect your hand from the blade, it comes with a blade guard for safe storage, and the overall design offers decent ergonomics which comes in handy for someone like me who has a small hand and a relatively weak grip. it's certainly the best pizza cutter i've ever owned--search for it on sale like i did and find yourself smiling at your great fortune!"
5,worked great,item was as described. fit like it was supposed to. found it here for less and received it quickly without damage.
5,Required reading,"The first chapter outline clearly the progression of events over several years, that led up to the terror acts of Sept. 11, 2001. Even if you don't read the entire book, the first chapter is a must read."
3,an fantastic pianist with a scratchy violinst,"Uchida is no doubt one of the best Mozart interpreters in the history, and her role in those sonatas is absolutely full of inspiration and elegance.However, the violinst really damage some part of music. He is very good at soft passages, but everytime when he plays forty, the sound is scratchy and flat, sometimes even rude.Hope Uchida will record some more mozart duo sonatas with a better violinst."

5,Great Product,I bought this for my fiance's birthday and he loved it! I don't know much about guns but it was a very great product! Sturdy and great quality.
5,One word: AWESOME!,"If you are looking for a top notch rifle case, you can't go wrong with this one. Pelican makes the best cases in the business. I initially scoffed at the idea of spending $200+ on a case, but when I thought about how much the items inside cost, I didn't hesitate. Do yourself a favor and buy this case if you plan to travel or carry your guns and you don't want to worry about them getting damaged. At 32 reviews and counting; all but one are 5 stars for a reason."
5,Beyond Habitat,"Received book in the condition advertised and prior to the date it was estimated to be received. I have no complaints and and highly recommend Amazon when ordering books, dvds, electronics, etc.Lewis R. Brown"
4,ABC: A Holiday Affair,"Because we watch these soap opera stars on TV, we enjoyed the CD very much. It was fun guessing which star was singing."
5,FANTASTIC CD,Love this CD. Really puts you in the holiday spirit. It is full of wonderful Christmas songs and the artists do a fantastic job. Can't say enough about it. LOVED IT.....
3,I enjoy it,"I casually play with paper, and this machine has definitely encouraged me to learn more about hand cutting items so i can advance my papercrafting skill level (i'm pretty much a beginner) , while encouraging me to continue to be creative and not limit myself to designs I am comfortable cutting by hand. It has also opened up my eyes to a whole new home-made crafting world, and I've been encouraged to seek out other mediums and forms of inks, embossing, stamping, and cutting...I'm a momma and work part time, it helps me to create gifts for people on a daily basis just to say thanks for keeping such a beautiful garden, or for bringing over cookies last week, or whatever little thing you want to tell someone. I'm not just sitting at home, I'm actively creating and learning new skills and designs."
5,A great understanding of The 23d Psalm,"This book really explains in detail how to undertand the Psalm. Each time I read it now, I get it! I never knew what the Rod and Staff realy meant until I read the book because Keller was a real Sheppard. It should be in all libraries in the home."
3,"Great Bogie-NO, Good Bogie-YES","After viewing Casablanca or Key Largo, this flick lets the audience down slowly. If Bogie never made a bad movie, and he probably didn't, the acting doesn't come up short, but the plot does. Ifthe viewer just wants to view as many of Bogies movies as possible, then this film is worth a look-see, but don't epect the classic Humprey Bogart here ?"
2,Great hammerdrill except for one crucial design flaw,"I was at first very happy with this hammerdrill. It's well built and comes with a case & two batteries. It also has a little clip on the handle to hold a screwdriver bit - brilliant. But when I started to drill into concrete the problems began. It drilled the holes as well as the Milwaukee I had borrowed from a friend, but apparently it has a design flaw that allows concrete dust to get inside and cause the speed control mechanism to get stuck. So when I tried to switch between the two speed settings, I wasn't able to push the switch ""all the way"" in either direction. That meant the chuck couldn't ""get in gear"" which means the motor turns but the chuck doesn't. So now the drill is totally useless. It's really too bad because I know Bosch makes great tools..."
1,Craptacular,"This book would have been a thousand times better if Ms. Forsyth had not gone so heavy on the Scottish accent her characters use. I realize that this book is set in a Scottish setting, but it's no use reading a book when you have to read and re-read a conversation three times so you can translate what they are actually saying. I can usually get used to a written dialect (Hagrid in Harry Potter, everyone in Their Eyes Were Watching God), not so with this book.Also, the plot goes nowhere for 3/4 of the book. I'm sure there was a climax in there somewhere, but I never found it. The ending was a cliffhanger. It was a fittingly crappy ending for a crappy book. Don't waste your money on this book or the sequel. I would not recommend this book unless you enjoy wasting a few hours of your life."
5,Yeah!,"I'm so glad Forsyth decide to return to her world of witches. I thought I'd read the last of them. In this latest series, the reader returns to this fatasy world of Eileanan 25 years in to the furture after the war. We are introduced to a young girl (half human and half syticorn). Because she favors her human side too much, she is in fear of her life. It is only a matter of time before her herd decides to kill her off as a weaker link. She escapes on the back of a wing horse and is found close to dead by a young man named Lewen (who happens to be the twenty year old son of Lilanthe and Niall). And yet, her journey has only just begun.The story leaves you hanging quite a bit, so now I'm stuck waiting for the next installment. Very much worth my time and yours."
4,Excelente,"Realmente es uno de los mejores Unplugged que he escuchado, lastima que no lo tenemos en CD, realmente vale la pena"
5,"The Unexpected Answer to ""Why""",I read this challenging book during a time of personal hurt and questioning. It helped me see that the answers to questions concerning why things happen as they do are not as important as the Christ who came as The Answer. I learned that our feeble attempts to manipulate and control God by our prayers and whining will not work -- we must accept the fallen-ness of our world and through faith in God's ultimate goodness we find Him. Very thought provoking and inciteful.
1,It's half a fondue pot!,"C'mon, it's half a fondue pot. Take last year's kitchen Chia pet, the fondue pot, and take off the pot and use it the same way you'd use this. I hate products like this. Alton Brown calls them uni-taskers and they are the type of lazy gift you get as a wedding present. They take up valuable space in the kitchen doing one stupid specialized task and often they do it worse than the traditional way of doing it. If you like this don't miss the Santa Fe quesadilla maker (a repurposed waffle iron) and the Salton Lemonader!"
2,Can't Fiind Refills,"The concept is great. My little girls were so excited.... problem is I spend 2 hours driving around trying to find the fuel refills to have Smores. REI, Dick's, Local supermarket. No one carries them. Ended up doing it on the stove.... which clearly defeats the purpose."
2,Great Movie - Poor Transfer,"I can only agree with all the positive comments about the movie itself. From the vintage shots of the old Army and Navy Club building to the early performances by a lot of great actors, this movie is one of the must-haves! There is however, one acting dissapointment: doesn't Gary Cooper seem sort of wooden throughout the film? He never seems very comfortable in uniform, and still can't salute worth a damn.Sadly, the technical aspects of this transfer leave a lot to be desired. I last saw this movie about 30 years ago on the late-late show (or maybe it was the early-early show) on one of the old local UHF stations and this version looks worse. I think the crappy analog, broadcast version of this movie was superior to what we have here. At it's core, this is a very poorly done transfer that is fuzzy, washed out, bad audio, and wrong picture aspect as to what is on the box. Can't honestly recommend it in it's current version."
2,Comfortable but not user friendly,"I ordered this wrist rest to replace an older Kensington version. The one I previously had was a single rest pad piece. This particular one has a separation in the wrist pad. It was very comfortable, but my right wrist kept falling in the gap as I was typing and moving my hand back and forth to the mouse. It became more irritating to use than comfortable, so I did not continue to use it. I did like the platform because it would have been very easy to keep clean."
1,not for me,"I've been experiencing the dreaded symptoms of carpal tunnel & decided I needed to quickly remedy the situation. I've just been using a regular, cheap, mouse pad without any padding. I like to simplify, so after carefully reading over the reviews, chose this product. It arrived today, & I'm telling you the truth, my wrist was on it for mere minutes when it began aching & burning. The padding is just too hard, not at all soft like the advertisement said--the rolled sock I'd been using felt better. And I was disappointed that the platform was some sort of hardwood that prevented the mouse from rolling smoothly. I'm sending it back for a refund."
5,"Excellent followup to ""burnin up""cd",Shawn Pittman's timing and phasing with lyrics on this 2nd cd have acknowledged his strong vocal talent. This album with original songs gives him and the band room to stretch their talents musically and emotionally with some of their best work to date. Shawn's guitar tone is fat and thick thoughout the album without being overbearing or too long on solo's. The bass and drummer lay down a solid foundation for Shawns tasteful guitar work. This 2nd cd is a must buy!
4,Slimeline corded silver wall mounted phone,"I was skeptical abount this phone based on the previous reviews but took a chance since it matches my Kitchen decor colors perfectly. In, addition the cite that I purchased it from ( thru Amazon ) was the only one that had it for $17.99 (and they only had 1 left, which only increased my skepticism.) So far so good. Very clear concise reception and it looks great. The cid works perfectly. I rarely use it. Only when when I need to answer a call right away and there is not a cordless phone nearby. So....right now I have a wait and see attitude. At any rate it won't be a great loss if it should konk out : )"
4,Top of the line action and fun.,"This is one of the best of the action/suspence romantic books I have read by Ms. Kauffman. This is the fourth of a series that has the hero or heroine that is a special agent. And with Scotti Giardi being the head of the group and Logan Blackstone being a black sheep, they make a wonderful couple. They both have to find a happy medium and figure who is wearing the pants."
1,Sony DRU-720UL,"This was a great burner until it stopped burning DVDs, after about 20 successful burns. It still burns CDs and reads DVDs, but every attempt to burn a DVD results in a ""power calibration error."" Same Memorex DVDs that used to work don't anymore. Searching the net revealed many other users of this product had the same problem. There is no fix. The product is now ready for the dust bin."
1,Not all that great,"I bought this item for my daughter who loves dinosaurs. When it arrived, it became obvious that it was not a toy, but a decor piece instead. Even though it is called a Benders Pterodactyl, you cannot move the pieces very much or they break off. Which makes the item's toy value a big fat zero."
1,Displeased!,"The Hoodflector just arrived and my husband and I were very dissappointed. It was not in a box or plastic and the package of clips and decal(s) that were supposed to be with it were no where except maybe with UPS somewhere. I would certainly NOT recommend this product or company to anyone nor will we purchase anything from them again.We will continue to make purchases with Amazon as we live over 100 miles away from Phoenix and even further from Tucson, we will just ask questions about product shipping."
5,nutrition for relationships,"I think of this book as an ""emotional diet"" book formy relatioships. Having grown up in a divorced family myself, I'vedeveloped many unhealthy habits over the years and this book helps keep me on track as far as feeding relationships healthy habits so their strong and healthy!"
5,Changed My life!,"Reading this book after a divorce and then another rocky relationship, really helped me get myself on track, before ever even considering another relationship. After a ""relationship fast"" and working on ME...I began dating again, and later found my fiance and soulmate! He is so different than the other men I have been with, but that is a good thing! What is so funny, is, awhile after he and I got serious, I came across the book, and inside fell out a slip of paper I had jotted down answers to one of the ""quizes""... It was listing the qualities of my dream partner... I had long forgottten about that list...but as I read it over, I realized that my fiance was all ten qualities! I have since recomended the book to many friends..."
1,Chinese quality,"As other reviewers noted, shoes are longer and narrower than marked size (10.5B ordered, actual size approx 11.5A). Pair I received were made in China, not US. Neil M US-made shoes are great but apparently their Chinese factory is not held to the same standards."
1,Damaged,The first shipment had 1 leaking bottle. I returned it and was happy to get another.The second shipment had a leaking bottle. I returned this shipment also. End of story.
2,Drugs are baaaaaad.....mmmmmkay,"This would have been better (way better) if Shaun Ryder had stayed even remotely sober through past singing Kinky Afro then we might have been on to something, aside from muttering "" errrr fookin 'ell"" he doesnt make much sense through the later half of the gig. Still dont suppose any of the crown at Elland road even noticed.......Pills Thrills & Bellyaches this aint"
4,The Bomb Baby!,"I am just feelin ice cube in his new song ""you can do it"". I love the beat. The other songs like chin check, money stretch, we murderers baby, and good friday are really tight. Mack 10 and Ja Rule are awesome. I would definetly recommend this cd!"
4,Up-beat!,"The beat bounces from the pages of this buoyant story. In it, Saxaphone Sam and his band beckon to young Drew and sister Sue on a dreary day, challenging them to find the bee-bop resounding through the house.When they discover the source of the music, they are transported into the big band era and they join in the jive: ""Zoo zoo wop, let's boogie `til we drop! Feel the floorboards shake as the room begins to quake!""Schneider's pizzazz-y pictures are so bright and whirly that readers may need sunglasses and Dramamine. Talk about chasing away the rainy day blues! Look to this book more for mood and pictures than for story or music history."
1,Cut and run if you have not finished watching it!,"....the point, if there was a point to this insipid film, is made after about the first 10 or twenty minutes of the movie..... .read the other one stars post and you have an accurate overview...I hope this review and the others one star reviews spare someone from wasting their time with what I believe to be one of the worst films around.. touted by some as an art film?>>>> only if you find a blank canvas worth contemplating.... Lousy, uninteresting characters, I do not wish to waste anymore of my time or yours related to this film..."
2,Spoiler Acid Test (Spoiler Free),"A very simple test: if you know the ending and think it's a good or suitable one, you might appreciate this movie. If not, you're in for a tedious, monotonous, characterless annoyance. Would have worked at 30 minutes."
5,Have a supply of water ready!,"This is the most realistic film about travel across the old West that I can remember ever seeing. I'd recommend having at least one LARGE glass of water while you watch, so everything is SO dry! This is the old West as it presumably REALLY was, with not much excitement or pleasure for a group of people following the Oregon Trail to a (hopefully) better life. Don't expect a shoot-em-up or movie with a lot of excitement; just sit back and be glad it wasn't YOU in this story! Good acting from the entire cast; Bruce Greenwood is a little scary in a standout performance."
4,A Western doesn't need cowboys,"A Western doesn't need cowboys. This is a very good film about ordinary folks (at least as ordinary as folks get who decide to cross a continent to find better lives) dealing with the trials of life on the trail. Many of those trials are born of man rather than nature which underpins the movie with constant tension. A somewhat more conventional ending would have probably been more satisfying, but the ending is very much in the style of Reichardt's other films and succeeds on its own terms.Great cast."
1,To the director: Go Back And Finish This movie!,"So for two hours we are watching what is essentially a survival story, only find that the movie ends before we can determine if the settlers can survive!Duh!Did the director run out of money?20 seconds more of filming could have provided us with an answer. Instead we are left guessing!I would hazard a guess that if most of us would know that this movie would leave us hanging this way then we wouldn't waste those hours watching it in the first place.To Kelly Reichardt - Can I have my 2 hours back please?I will need to be paid to watch another of your movies!"
1,An Art Movie not a Movie Movie,"We rented this movie for a family night and hoping the kids would learn some history. Slow although I see the artistic try in this movie but I am not really into this type of ""art"". Liviing in an Alaska camp some of the portrayals of harsh life, women with dirty hands and the lady who stuck to her conscience was accurate,although she didn't know why. However,I wanted a movie and this was boring and lost my middle school age children in boredom so watch it if you want to see a artistic type movie that actually got us talking about artistic movies but did nothing for the topic of families traveling the Oregon Trail."
2,Lasted all of 2 days with my 5 yr old,"My 5 yr old loved the toy, problem is quality of the product is crappy. The ball bearing the beyblade spins on came out on the very first day playing in the kitchen area on tiles.The 'lock' is plastic and that broke on the second day. Overall, my 5 yr old played with it for about 2 days while it worked, and then improvised to play with it for maybe another 4-5 days as he was real excited to have it. Anyway for $20+ product I would have expected a better quality."
3,Good business advice,I expected more from this CD but on the whole not a bad start. There are better books by him. This seemed more like an amalgamation of his other work.
2,Not as good as the real Retief,"Sort of like the author had a check list of what Laumer would do and just repeated it over and over. Did not make an effort, in my view, to take the character some where a little new. Which would really have helped."
1,Love GO AWAY!!!Please,"Alright now Larenz Tate is an excellent actor, but this movie is not worth applying towards his credits. The story line could have been good, but the way they unfolded this story line was boring!!!!!!Deborah Cox is an extraodinary singer and the little bits that you hear in this movie is the best part of the movie. Now this should have been a made for t.v. movie, because the little nude scenes could have been omitted and the few cuss words were not necessary either. I wish Larenz Tate had scrapped this movie and went back to the drawing board and started over. Sorry, not a good dvd."
4,Another knockout!,I've read all the Parker books and enjoyed them tremendously. I'm really going to miss them.There's nothing out there to compare! I guess I'll finish the Dortmunder series and then what? Any suggestions?
4,Hello! Can you list the author properly?,"This novel was written by ""Richard Stark"" The forward is by Block. It is wrong and misleading to list the authors in that order"
3,Audio quality SUB-par,"Not to detract from Ms. Jackson's incredible talent, whoever created this DVD was asleep at the wheel.The audio quality is... well, horrible. Absolutely, horrible.On the back, it says ""Audio remastered at 'SoundScape'"". I will watch for that name and never buy anything remastered by 'SoundScape'.I hope this is helpful to someone, I don't want anyone buying this DVD thinking they are going to get excell..., not excellent, just average audio quality would have been OK with me!!!"
2,Not so impressed as others.,"We just had the privilege of attending the production of ""Jacques Brel is Alive and Well and Living in Paris"" at the Stratford Festival in Stratford, Ontario, Canada. It was an amazing performance which made me excited about finding a really good quality CD. Amazon recommended this recording and I ordered it. After listening to it last night I must sadly report that I was disappointed. The quality of the performances by the New York production was very inferior to those of the Stratford Festival. If you can make it to Stratford before the end of the season, you will LOVE this show.Lowell Dodge, M.D."
3,"Not a biography of Garbo, but a subjective look at beauty","This is not a biography of Garbo, but it is a ""study"" of Garbo and the way she embodied the most perfect form of beauty in the 20's and early 30's. It is interesting to note how much society's notion of beauty has changed in 80 years. This book discusses this and if you are interested in this era, in particular, Hollywood and it's ideals, this is an interesting piece of non-fiction for your shelf.There are many pictures and references of Garbo and her unique physical attributes. It is mentioned that no celebrity has ever been able to emulate her unique beauty, since many celebrities like to take from the past for their inspiration. This is case point in Monroe's emulation of Harlow. If you are fascinated with Garbo, this book is a must-have. She was truly one-of-a-kind."
4,Propitious,"Yes, uh, it's very useful. I've been using it as a paperweight, but I'm sure it will be put to better use in the future."
5,"All I can say is, wow.","This guy is amazing. I don't have the CD yet, but I've heard a bunch of the tracks, and... wow. Beautiful and compelling. Not just more of the same. This music is like nothing else I've seen. Just listen to it, especially the track It's Too Late. The feeling is amazing, as is the content. In its combination of angst, love, and so much else, brings to mind Quadrophenia, among so many other things. Music like this doesn't come along every day. Wow."
5,Awesome,"I love this album, it's nothing like anything you'll find in america. Purely original and straight from london garages... great use of simile and allusion... full of great english slang and innuendos."
1,This guy [is very bad],"I cant believe that anybody actually likes this mess. It makes me mad that people actually dig this. Although in a way if rap starts to sound like this then it wont be no problem cause rock is the only music that is keeping it real now days. How can you people actually like this [junk]? I swear it's the worst thing ever. And just when I thought rap couldn't [get worse]...Just, damn, what else can I say??? I am a avid old school rap listener and i even lik the underground stuff here in texas and this really bites. If rap goes to this i will never buy another rap Cd and not allow my kids too either. It's just a shame that people settle for this horrible ""music"", when there is good music out there that will never be recognized, because if it's not on mtv, then people don't buy it."
5,i no the guy from streets!!! heehee album is fantastic!,omg this album is so gd!! it brings a new sound to the industry and brings a gd sound. ... this album is gr8 to dance to and so i think buying this would b worth every penny. well hey thts my opinion. so yeh. go mike go mike go mike. heehee.
1,Rolling in their Grave,"Good thing Jammaster J is not alive to hear this album. For the 9 out of 10 ""Streets"" fans who feel listening to this garbage makes them hiphop fans Jammaster Jay was the DJ for one of the most prolific and influential froups ever ""Run-DMC"". Anyway, the Streets is characterized by simple video game music beats and a monotonic british accent that utilizes the same exact rythym on every song on the record. THis is hipster garbage that any person who listens to REAL hiphop will find offensive. Check out MC Paul Barman, LAst Emperor, DJ Vadim, Jurrasic 5, Gang-Starr, and anything on Ninja Tune records.-TPF"
3,Still waiting for this one to grab me.,"Ok, yes it's different. Yes, it's a tad refreshing. But, having said that, some of the songs are fairly boring and unoriginal. Plus, (and this maybe my own preference) the british accent is SO heavy that it almost takes away from the wonderful beats that are playing. By no means am I the spokesman for rap, but is it fair to really call this Rap? Classifications aside, Mike Skinner's ""raps"" are often good, and often dull and juvenile. Not a bad disc, but in my opinon it is undeserving of all the critical acclaim it has received."
5,"Sherlock Holmes' ""missing years""","Writing pastiches of Conan Doyle's famous detective has become something of a cottage industry for many years. Some good stories are written, and some bad ones. This book belongs to the former category: a well written series of nine stories purporting to give some insight into what Holmes was doing after his ""death"" fighting Professor Moriarity. In these stories he travels throughout Asia, encountering various historically correct characters and many fictional ones, and solving several intriguing mysteries. There are beautiful women, dastardly villans, and helpful assistants, not to mention a unique travelogue of intriguing places in the Orient. The writing reminds one of Doyle, which is good, and Holmes appears to stay very close to his creator's character. I assume that there will be more stories ""found"" about Holmes by this author, and I look forward to reading them very much."
4,Refreshingly exotic,"For anyone interested in Gurkha fighters the east and Sherlock this is a very satisfying read. So refreshing it was to allow Holmes the chance to ply his work outside of old London, not to mention the fact that it fits well into the outline of the cannon. I liked it and wouldn't be bothered if the author extended Holmes role in the East in future titles."
4,Helpful info for relationships,This is good information for those going through divorce. It should be required reading for those contemplating marriage.
4,Another Good One In The Series...,"Another great book from the duo. The authors give an excellent description of ""unsafe"" people. I also think that the authors hit home with some really hard truths about personal responsibility. I believe that this book, read in combination with the book, Boundaries, (also by the same authors)could produce some life-changing behaviors....especially since the books are Biblically based."
5,"if you werent taught, this book will teach you","I read this book a while ago, and I think I liked it so much I read it too fast :) But I see on here that there are some not so good reviews. I thought this book was fantastic! If you are familiar with Dr. Henry Cloud and Dr. John Townsend, you are familiar with their biblicaly backed up work. In this book, they explore what makes an unsafe person, how we attract unsafe people, and how to find safe people. Another ""problem to solution"" book of theirs. They give a solution after breaking down the problem. After reading this book, I realized that some of the realationships in my life were unsafe and why. This book gave me courage to let go of these unsafe relationships or challenge them. To some people, determining safe people comes easy, but it doesnt always come easy to me. I may have an internal inkling that something isnt right, but I dont know why or how to solve it. This book is helpful in that regard."
2,Bedroom...,"To be honest, this is the first book in my whole life that I didn't even finish.I couldn't find a real story here...this was all about her in a bedroom or how to get her into one.I expected more."
3,"Tea: a good healthy cup, thanks","Overall, this book sets you up for what appears to be, a good series.There was a lot of action mixed with lots of sexual tension, added to a denial about the sexual tension, made for some funny situations and characters. Good strong characters, and a pretty good story, set in a period piece.It follows a young woman who ends up falling for the wrong guy (someone not considered a gentleman)..and he for her..yet they're both in denial, through out most of the story..added to that an unsavory gentleman is trying to make her marry him, thus preventing dragging her family into a battle, though he captures her brother (unknown to her)...Each book follows a different brother, as they find and settle in (or try to) with their mate."
4,Every faith community should share this video,Our parish used this video around a new ministry to strengthen and support the vocation of families. It is quite the conversation starter. Deals with difficult issues by focusing on the data - well designed report.
5,The next best thing to Sublime!,"The boys from Slightly Stoopid are Slightly Sublime with their punk-reggae style and melodic tunes. If you were/are a Sublime fan and can appreciate the sounds of Bradley Nowell and friends...you will definitely love this album. Slightly Stoopid keeps it real though with their own added flavor and personality which is young at heart. These guys are the next BIG thing in the surf/punk, reggae/dance hall scence! I have been a fan since 1996 and definitely recommend this album as one of their best!"
1,"Rigid, opinionated","As the other reviewer noted- ""What I didn't like was his ""there's just one right way"" attitude.""Yes, this is a pervasive problem.I worked with Dr Sammons as a parenting coordinator, and found him to be arrogant, and rigid in what the ""right answer"" was, according to his own 'mine is superior to yours' wisdom.Not surprising this attitude is reflected in the book.Disappointing"
5,One of the Best,This is without a doubt one of the best books I have ever read. If you are serious about knowing the real Jesus. PLEASE get this book.
5,The audio version is watered down. READ THE BOOK!,"A wonderful job by Yancey. You can't help feeling closer to Jesus. A careful magnification of the humanity and spirituality of the God-Man in a way that doesn't disturb scripture. You will be taken back to that historic time frame as an observer. The author brings to light many truthsthat diplay the feelings and the incredible Love of Jesus, that will leave you wanting to love him back all the more!"
3,good book but not enough substance,i enjoyed reading the book one time but on the second pass i found that the only part i was really intrigued by was the chapter about the sermon on the mount. in general i would say the book is full of insight but the reader has to wade through a lot of fluff.
2,Maybe some other time,"I've changed a lot in the last few years, so I'm thinking I might have enjoyed this book if I'd read it some time ago. I did read a Yancey book about 10 years ago about suffering and it was really good. He wrote as one who knows. So I was a bit surprised that I didn't connect with this book, too. It just seemed to me that the tone leaned more toward clinical and not personal."
4,Fresh and Genuine,"I do not generally buy mainstream popular Christian books. But this was suggested for a group of friends to discuss. I found it non-formulaic, stimulating, the type of thinking that is a good basis for discussion in a group of serious seekers after the real Jesus."
5,A Great Start to Knowing Jesus Again,"Many Christians have pre-conceived notions of who Jesus is, was and will be, without having actually read the Bible for themselves. This book certainly helps to remove the popular myths and stories of who Jesus is.Yancey has a very engaging style that is honest, funny at times, but always thought provoking. When I was reading the book, I kept turning back to the Bible, to read passages that I ""thought I knew"", but now seeing and understanding better, and knowing Jesus once again.While one may not agree with all of Yancey's observations, let the contents of the book kickstart you to know Jesus better for yourself."
4,help without the psychobabble,"Dr. Cloud does a thoughtful and credible job of weaving his Christian beliefs in with his psychological insights to create a useful and practical self-help book. By following his advice, readers can grow deeper relationships, a stronger faith, and greater confidence in their ability to solve problems and deal with the difficulties of life.In each of the sixteen chapters he offers readers techniques that have worked in his psychological practice for bonding with others in a healthy way, creating and respecting personal boundaries, accepting both the good things and the bad thing about life, and learning to take responsibility for our choices.Even tough he sometimes uses examples from the Bible out of context, his insights are worth reading and should help most people to better understand the past and how it affects the way they look at life and to make positive changes in their attitude and actions to help them grow healthier relationships."
4,PhD,"If its difficult to grasp a clear and chronological understanding of the Bible or if your just a child at heart, then this is the book for you! Reading and understanding the Bible has never been easier than this. It's the Bible presented as a novel with characters and events that come alive because the reader becomes transported back in time to witness the greatest story ever told!!!"
4,Amazon book of God,This book helps you understand the Bible stories a lot easier. You can actually picture in your mind with what's going on. It really has kept me interested in reading more about the Bible.
4,Good Novelization,I couldnt really get into this the writing just didnt click with me. It is a neat idea to flesh out classic Bible stories and would be great for someone learning the basics as long as they know its not the Bible
1,Doesn't work in Seattle area,"I could not get this to work (Seattle area), and I tried numerous scenarios (car, home stereo, jam box, etc.). Back to the dreaded cassette adapter, which works but is a pain due to the wire.Might be asking Santa for a more integrated car adapter...Or perhaps the big iPod Hi-Fi system could be dashboard mounted? :-)"
2,instantly defective memory,"arrived with crease along middle which wouldnt undo, even after 3 days, thereby creating uncomfortable ridge. not a quality product."
5,Such Incredible Talent,"I am in awe of the singular and collective talent of these gentlemen; what a cultural treasure! This CD beautifully showcases their talent. My personal favorite is Victor Trent Cook's bittersweet rendition of ""Mr. Bojangles."" Another great number is ""When the Saints Go Marching In,"" which could give an atheist a religious experience! For people who enjoy strong vocalists, any one of these guys would fit the bill; together, they're simply aweseome! America's answer to the 3 tenors, only better."
4,R.I.P Daddy..,"Even though this is my father I have no biases toward this album. I dont particularly love blues music but my dad (Big Ike)sang with his heart. I think that is what makes this album so great. You can hear and analyze his feeling in certain songs such as End of the Rainbow. He made about 4 albums during his career and this one in my opinon was the most professional and heartfelt. He passed away a week or so before it was released and right after he'd signed a record contract with Mardi Gras records of Metarie,La. He put his heart into this album. He loved making music. He, along with his great music are truly missed."
4,Simply wonderful!,"I enjoyed this book a great deal. It is informative without being overbearing and has a lot that will interest the established trapper and the 'green-fur' novices alike. Mr Faler has obviously come through a lot to finally pen this volume, particularly after the break-up of his partnership with other Mink-trapping veteran AR Harding (his book also available on Amazon). I would place myself in neither camp enjoying the style of both men when it comes to snaring the sleek coated beasts.Features I particularly enjoyed in Falers guide are the addition of pop-up sections and a guide to constructing dioramas. This has certainly helped me a lot to become part of the world of the mink trapper. Living on the 20th floor of a tower block has often made me feel like it was a world I could never experience...In summary if you are looking for a book to welcome you with open... arms to the world of mink trapping then you could do a lot worse than this."
5,I love this game!,I started with a free trial version and I had to buy it because I couldn't stop playing! All four versions are fun and addictive!
5,Finding Kim Barnes,"If you enjoy not only a good story with an unusual setting, but an author who is a real wordsmith, try this book. Barnes chooses her words carefully, and in almost all situations they fit perfectly. The author becomes the 17-year-old main character, Buddy. She has the ability to watch people, especially men, and pick up the nuances of their gestures, speech patterns, and emotions. The details of the central Idaho setting are so real that you will feel you are walking through, and seeing, them. Although the main review (above) criticizes her as having confusing or unrealistic sub-plots, they are less that than almost surreal experiences crammed into a brief few months. Many of these experiences are the reactions of a headstrong, impulsive man/boy who is faced with big decisions. The only disappointing part is the ending where Barnes flips forward to a much older Buddy, as if to find a way to end the story, and then in the last paragraph reverts to the 17-year-old boy."
2,Not a favorite,"I never was able to follow this book, but can't say it was the book or me. I just could not understand where it was going and never did finish it. I ended up giving it to the Goodwil - hopefully it blessed someone else."
4,Evocative,"Gets at the heart of what's causing clutteritis, and then eases one into the traumatic process of parting with classic junque-stuff. The title is a fair precis of what the book is about."
5,"If you're buried in your ""stuff"", this book's for you!","What a wonderful, insightful book. Although I'm just beginning to weed out my ""stuff"", this book makes the mind/spirit/materialism connection. I have mentally gone through all the things that are robbing me of vital energy and can't wait to get started. I had no idea why I had no energy or couldn't sleep well. It was all my stuff taking up space and energy. This book has made so much sense. It says we use only 20% of our stuff 80% of the time. I certainly believe it. It's a wonderful book. I just wish I had its wisdom years ago. I wouldn't have gotten so bogged down now. Great, great book!"
5,Clear your clutter and your mind will follow!,"Fantastic book. It's absolutely incredible (almost spooky) how well the tips and techniques put to use in this book really help you day to day. This is not a self help book as much as a self help miracle.Also, if any of you out there are adults with ADD like me, trust me, it's worth every penny.I've already decided to buy her other book, ""Creating Sacred Space with Feng Shui."""
5,Get rid of that clutter!,This book made me realize how much clutter around the house really does stress me out. I've become motivated to clean it up and I'm so happy with the results. My living room is virtually clutter free and it's amazingly so much more relaxing to spend time in there!
4,Changed my life,This is a great book that is easy to read. Every page makes sense and you want to implement the ideas conveyed immediately. I strongly recommend 95% of what this book contains. Read the book and discover the 5% no-one will recommend to even their best friend!
1,Purchasing this book will add clutter to your life,"Karen Kingston has written a book cluttered with nonsense. The conclusions she draws about clutter and those who have it, are questionable at best, but often downright untrue. She places much importance on symbolism. Only the mentally and spiritually weak would buy into such superstitious foolishness. There is little written about how to remove clutter from your environment. If you want a book that provides information on clearing clutter to improve your time management, and create a healthy and beautiful environments to live and work in, this is not the book."
3,such a rip-off,"it's funny how they say its been or its getting discontinued .. smell pretty weird for sure,.. the only thing i can say is great price and nice way to attract peolpe to buying it.. truly i don't think its worth it... i'll stick to my other colognes."
4,early Tim Kasher,Dont forget not only is this some of the earlier stuff for Bright Eyes's Conor Oberst. But Cusive's Tim Kasher was part of this little project as well.
4,Unbelievable!!,"Extremely educational flick. Your not going to be on the edge of your seat for this one but rather sit back,relax and enjoy some fine film making."
3,Purchased Book Surprise,"The book itself is in good condition. There are no markings,bent pages or anything like that. The price of the book was wonderful.My only problem was that when I looked for the book online, the Edition of the book was not given. I chose the book by the picture on the cover of the book. I needed the 3rd edition and what I got was the 4th edition. The articles are all there that I needed for class just they did not line up with the directions given by my English instructor."
1,Poor start,"I found this book unreadable. The writing is simplistic and the characters seem llike charicatures. I hope Benson improves, as I don't wish to wait another 10 years for another writer to come aboard."
2,00Bad,"I was a bit frightfull when John Gardner stoped writing the series and for good reason. Although a good attempt is made by Benson in his first shot at writing a Bond novel it falls short of expectations. The plot is intresting enough, envolving the hand over of Honk Kong to China back a few years ago, but it is a dull story. You feel as if Bond is a dumb man, going from location to location being told the story as you read it. Most of Fleming and Gardner's works are 100 times better than this yarn. It ranks with ""The Man with the Golden Gun"" as one of the worst novels I beleive I've ever read. Two stars: one because I can't give less than 1 star and the second, just because it's 007...well...it's kinda 007."
4,Best Modern Day Bond Yet,"In Benson's first Bond novel, he executes the best historical fictional story in all of the world. Benson's use of the July 1st takeover is magnificent. The evil Thackery, is one of the best villains yet, possibly even better than Fleming's Goldfinger. Benson makes Thackery the best villain, because of his egotistic dream of destroying Hong Kong. The thought of destroying a country can only be written so superbly in a Bond novel. If Zero Minus Ten was not a Bond novel, Benson's portrayal of Thackery could not be so realistic. As I a lways thought, the best part of any Bond novel is the villain. Benson is now the king of Bond. The best Bond novelist yet, it is only a shame that he was not chosen early to fill Fleming's shoes. This novel is so good that the Queen should give this American a knighthood for presenting 007 of Her Majesty's Secret Service so well for an American."
1,This was rather horrid,I miss Ian Fleming. He was the greaatest. Raymond Benson is a cheap replacement for the best novelist ever.
2,Couldn't finish this book,"I wanted to like ""You Must Remember This"" especially after reading all the great reviews + the plot sounded interesting. I couldn't finish the book . It got boring. Maybe I'm just going through a ""reader's block"" spell where I can't get into anything I read.Something about the way the story was written was dull."
5,"finally, something with depth","I was amazed at how good this book was...I have been reading so many books that are just so FORGETTABLE (Vinegar Hill...what was that about...I can't remember...), or worse, just plain trashy (Divine Secrets of Ya Ya Sisterhood...please....). This one was in a totally different league. If you want to read something by someone who can really write, choose this. Forget all about Oprah."
4,Quite a good book,Overall I am extremely happy with this book. The patterns have plenty of variety and the instructions are easy to follow. The only thing that I really can say that's not a positive is that it's really more like 126 knitted blocks. I really don't consider the same pattern in a different colorway to be a completely different block and I don't think it should be counted as such.
1,It simply doesn't work!,"I bought this for my mom, so i can go about my day without constanly worrying about her. She had hip replacement surgery about a year ago after a life threatening accident but she still is very unstable and falls a lot.BUT! The pendant which is the reason why I bought the phone in the first place, will not trigger any calls whatsoever.Don't even think it was us, we did everything by the manual, many many times over 'till we finally gave up.(Batteries and power supply on both units work just fine if you are wondering and we CAN read and follow instruction from a manual!)So THIS PHONE is utterly useless to us or anyone else for that matter.Too bad we found out after the 30 day return period Amazon grants their customers."
4,Lots of fun,"My dog and I have had lots of fun with this thing. I had gotten a very sore shoulder from throwing for her so frequently. A few months with this device, and no more sore shoulder, despite lots of ball play. It took her some getting used to at first; she couldn't predict where the ball was going, or she didn't seem as interested, because it didn't seem as ""personal"", but she's over that now. She loves it, and she can tell what direction I am aiming it. No complaints with the hardware - fine after several months of use."
4,Good value,"If you're looking for a simple, well-made belt for jeans or casual pants, this is a good choice. Soft leather, but well made."
3,very cute but not true to size,There's this elastic in the slingback that makes the rest of the material stick out if the shoe is too big for you. And I'm a real size 8. so it's frustrating that the size shoe I bought looks awkward.
3,Basic details were covered in a simple manner.,"As a novice I found this book helpful at learning the very basics of craps. To me, the bold print and the drawing were helpful.After reading this book and going to the casino I found that I could perform basic functions and know what I was doing. What I am desiring after a few trips to the casino is a second stage (an intermediate level) that goes into brief straight-forward details of other bets on the table. I realize these bets are not recommended, but I have seen the table ""hot"" and nice rewards gained there.I enjoy the game and I am ahead. If the table is cold (or turns cold) I walk away."
3,Almost Perfect,"Great product with one problem I think that is B12 5mg. It feels great then I get sleepy or groggy after a couple of hours of taking it, I believe its the B12 that wants to put me to sleep. Wish there was an option for no B12 then it would be 5 stars."
4,Unique Swing Sound,"This is a great new swing CD. Dr. Zoot has a very unique sound, one of the tracks, Pretty Boy Floyd, even includes a banjo. This is one of my favorite swing CDs for listening. I DJ a weekly swing nite, and I've found a few tracks that have been big hits on the dance floor, (ex. Trip the Night Fantastic and Twirl that Skirt) but most of the tracks are a bit too long to comfortably dance to. Overall, it's a great CD!"
3,Not for a novice with no musical background,"I want to learn how to sight-read, and perhaps its not a goal that I can accomplish with just a book and no teacher. I have an idea that for a person who has played an instrument in the past, or has a fundamental understanding of notation, this book is just fine. However, if you're like me, just starting, the book reads like a school textbook that the teacher is going to use in class, and then quiz you on next week! I'm going to keep it because I'm taking piano lessons, and the book might actually mean something in a few weeks/months."
2,The carnal mind...,"I have to agree with the negative critiques previously submitted. It is indeed an expression of the Laodicean Age's religiosity and teeters on heresy. Too strong? I don't expect nonChristians to understand Christian terminology, concepts, precepts, etc., any more than someone studying accounting for the first time understands accounting terminology. The true accounting however will come from the expressed expectations given to the Church to teach new believers proper dogma and appropriate spiritual behaviors. No wonder the Church in the Laodicean Age has become so pathetically weak and ineffective unless applying business principles of sales, marketing, and management techniques. Nothing new under the sun. I've heard this nonsense before. And the consequences follow the victims forever..."
1,Beware of the Purpose Driven Church! It is not what it seems,"On the surface, PDC looks innocent enough. But once the curriculum is implemented in the church, there are changes you didn't bargain for. The Holy Spirit is subdued, the church is run like a corporate business. (remember, God's ways are not our ways) The sermons are boring and similar to New Age thinking (everything is based on ""how I feel""). People who don't like the changes (the spiritually-mature and Biblically-established Christians) are told to go with the program or get out! The church may grow, but the new converts are being taught only a 'positive' message. Sin, redemption, repentance are not mentioned. The whole Gospel is not preached. Please!DO NOT USE THE PURPOSE-DRIVEN CHURCH CURRICULUM IN YOUR CHURCH!"
5,The Church is about Growing Christians,Rick Warren has hit the nail on the head by addressing the great weakness for many churches that are involved in every other agenda than the purpose for which God created the church. This is required reading for anyone who takes seriously Christ's command to make disciples of all nations
4,purpose driven,"It was very interesting, especially the 5 purposes of the church and how there needs to be balance of all five for a church to thrive. Being a military spouse and attending churches all over the world, it was illuminating to think back to each church and see which ones were attentive to all the purposes and which were not. You will really see a correlation between meeting the purposes and a thriving growing church."
2,OK - buts lacks Biblical Depth,"I give Mr. Warren credit for his apparent zeal to bring the lost into the church and into a saving knowledge of Jesus Christ. However, although he often states that his 5 purposes are what the Bible says are to be the central purposes of the church - the book lacks a chapter in which the Bible is used to exegetically prove that this is the case. It's not a book I would reccomend but I wouldn't say ""dangerous - stay away"" either."
1,Absolutely Awful,"I can't think of a single positive about this book. Not only does it fail to teach anything about OLE DB development, the code presented simply does not work. (The author, however, claims that it will.) It actually gets worse, though. If you attempt to try to find any sort of updates, as mentioned by website in the book's introduction, you'll find that the relevant webpages don't exist!So, what you get is:-Reference information you can somewhere else (and more cheaply),-Nothing to learn,-Buggy code, and-No way to update itDo NOT buy this book for ANY reason, as the other reviewers have indicated."
4,Ever After,"I think Ever After was a really cool book. It's lika a cinderella story. It was so interesting and enjoyable that I read the whole book in one sitting. This book is sad, happy, and funny and that's what makes it such a good story. I would recommend this book to any of my friends who like to read. I hope you enjoy this book."
5,Excellent,Excellent for the period. This film shot Steiger into Stardom. A must see for all holocaust aftermath followers.
3,"A ""Howto"" book without the ""to""!","A very good uptodate book listing schools that give athletic scholarships for major and minor sports. This compilation is upto date and seemingly very complete. It is a invaluable tool for writing schools and inquiring about sport scholarships. HOWEVER, the schools do not have the addresses listed, only the name and city with a zipcode. This is highly disappointing. It tells you how but not to...lame. Would probably try a less complete book with the address of athletic department and just supplement the schools I could not find. A great resource tool made into mediocre."
1,Sonic is slooooooow,"Excessively frequent load screens, horrible animations, terrible camera, and absolutely BORING gameplay make this one of the worst games of all time on any system. I'm amazed that this title would pass quality control. The 360 has so much better to offer, skip this one completely and grab ""Gears of War"", ""Oblivion"", or ""Lost Planet"". ""Viva Pinata"" for the kiddies and sim fans."
4,"Great graphics, great fun","The graphics have taken an impressive leap forward since the last sonic games, and the added characters are a great bonus. (My fave: blaze the cat.) No chows made me give this a 4 instead of a 5, but it still deserves a great rating."
1,NO Stars!!! C-R-A-P!!!!!! Not good enough for kids either.,"Very bad controls, won't mention the old school looking GFX (are we sure this was meant for the 360??). Your view gets blocked more often than you play, easily die due to crapy camera style. Oh, lets not even talk about the hefty pricetag, thanks for nothing. RENT this if for some reason you want to torture yourself. If you want some sonic action break out the sega or dreamcast."
2,HUH!?,Ibought and played this game for a month and got close to beating everyones story and even got the purple gem on sonics story but next time i turned it on i couldnt access my saved file and i cant save again. I would rate 5 stars because of the gems and stuff because its fun to use theme but I will rate 2 stars for this thing loosing my saved file and not letting me save.
2,Okay... For a Broken Game,"All in All, It's a good game... Except that the game was never finished. It's a broken game, and wasn't the best.Pros--music-charactersCons--Broken game-horrible voicing-gameplay could have been better"
1,FALLS APART,This toy was terrible. We could not get the toy to stay together. It was a shame because my son was so very exicted upon seeing the toy in the box. This toy was a huge disappointment. DOn't waste your time and money!!!
3,Sass and Class,"Her lone Pendulum album is good. It's gota slammin' remake of ""Still In Love With You.""vampy ""Release Me"" and the best performancein the gospel wallz ""Let's Be Real."" Now Butthere were some throwaways. Noteable is alsoa track called ""The Tears"" which made RnBtop 20. Great vocalist needs just more greattunes to bring it on home."
2,Buttons not recessed,"This great little watch does everything its advertised to do for a reasonable price, but has one big flaw. The four large set buttons are exposed in such a way as to be inadvertently bumped and changing the function which happens all the time. Its especially bad when using the dual time function, when an accidental bump to either of two buttons actually changes the displayed time in half hour increments. This can easily cause the missing of an appointment."
4,Casio W753-1AV,"For the money, can't beat the price and quality. Date is hard to read an certain angles.Two things I would change. One, buttons protrude a bit to the point that when you bend your wrist the mode changes. Two, the light is a regular led. Seems a bit chinsy......but for $20.....it's still an excellent buy."
2,Can't See Tide Graph,"The main reason I bought the watch is the tide graph which i can only read under a bright light with my reading glassed on, even the back light doesn't help, the alarm indicator is unreadable as well. On the plus side the Time and the date are readable without glasses. This watch replaced a 15 year old Casio tide watch that failed, I could see the tide graph and alarm indicator on that one no problem. I'm shopping for another tide watch."
4,nice watch,"For the money its really a great watch, but it can be a little confusing. It has a navigation feature that I can't seem to get the hang of. It also has a tide clock but the closest tide table to N.Y. was Boston ?! So maybe they have a website you can look at for a closer tide table to your locale.Like I said for the money its great, maybe someday I'll have the time to figure out how it works."
1,Bad casting and indifferent conducting,"I had high hopes for this new recording, but I was severely disappointed. Voigt doesn't do as well as expected in the title part, her voice sounding not at all gorgeous and her interpretation wooden. The other cast members are even less satisfactory. Botstein conducting lacks imagination and Straussian heft."
3,Heavy going.,The subject is fascinating but I still haven't finished the book. Very heavy and sleep inducing. Having read several other books dealing with related subjects written by various other authors this was rather a disappointment.
4,should be on high school reading list,"Interesting and detailed. The book is very good, but the movie, which is in art houses now (June '07) is excellent and it was easier to keep track of the thievery of the Nazis, and the efforts of the excellent Monuments men who tried to sort things out and return stolen property. I knew that the Nazis confiscated art, but I had no idea that it was on such a vast scale. I recommend reading the book AND seeing the movie."
1,Did we read the same book?,"As I look over some of the other reviews, I can't help but wonder if I read the same book. This novel failed to hold my attention past the first 30 pages or so. I live in New Orleans and thought it might be fun to read this, but I was mistaken. Though Herren captures the, er, quirky aspects of our fair city, he fails to master the art of storytelling. Worse yet, though, is the sloppy editing and the truly clunky writing style. I don't think this could even qualify as ""beach reading."""
2,"On the Pot, but little Luck","We find our hero wondering who he wants to be, not deciding, and putting out product that is not worthy of his skills. It is a shame. ""Potential"" might be the worst description you can give to someone, but you can't help it here. Elvis could have done so much better, his potential really was unlimited. Elvis is a million miles away from Memphis (at least in his mind) and he could do so much better. His voice is as good as ever, and he is learning to stretch it to get even more from it. His choice of material is weak though.Suspicion heads the list here, and we go downhill quickly. Night Rider and That's Someone you'll never forget are at least passable. But the rest of the material is forgettable, you will have no desire to repeatedly listen to it.Buy this if you have to have everything Elvis ever did, or if it has some significance to your personal past. Otherwise, pay just for the songs you really want, or pass on this altogether."
3,"Scotch Brand ""Magic"" matte tape works better","try Scotch Brand ""Magic"" tape for the Graffiti area on your Palm.. ""Magic"" tape has a matte, or raised surface. The matte surface adds a nice feel of resistance to the stylus somewhat similar to paper. putting the tape only in the graffiti area keeps visibility unobstructed in the main viewing area."
4,GOOD OLD FASHIONED GOTHIC THRILLS,"It's 1953, and Vincent Price is about to appear in his first horror film, a move that of course predicated what was to be the genre we remember this marvelous actor for. Filmed in 3-D, a feat in itself for fifty years ago, this tale revolves around Price, a wax museum curator, who is badly disfigured in a fire set by his greedy partner (the effable Roy Roberts) in order to get the twenty five thousand dollars in insurance money. A few years later, a now demented Price wants revenge and gets it, while setting up a fanciful new wax museum whose figures have a secret twist. We all know how they're made, but it's fun guessing along. Carolyn Jones (Addams Family), Phyllis Kirk, Frank Lovejoy and Charles Bronson all show up in supporting roles and the end result is a campy, enjoyable thriller, actually much more interesting than the confusing 2005 remake. Price fans will love this one."
4,Two spooktacular movies for the price of one,"I love truly 'classic' horror, both literature and film. There are very few movies that would qualify under this title, among them: Bela Lugosi's Dracula, Karloff's Frankenstein, Lancaster in The Island of Dr Moreau, The Invasion of the Body Snatchers. The House of Wax I can now add to the list. Vincent Price is perfect in his role, the mood set by the movie is almost out of Sherlock Holmes with the gaslit streets and Hansom cabs on cobblestone roads.A suprise to me was how good the bonus feature was. The original Mystery of the Wax Museum from 1933, done in Technicolor. I have to admit, it was even better than House of Wax!"
4,House of Wax : revisited,"from reviewing Vincent Price & his horror make-up w/ Roger Corman from the early '60s (Pit & the Pendulum , the Raven , Masque of the Red Death & others) & Famous Monsters of Filmland magazine articals the House of Wax was on a pick-up list for a long time....finally laying my hands on a copy (DVD) the 1953 classic is a proven classic"
5,Armor Is The Way To Go,This book gives a very good over view of the history of tanks and their tactics. I found the book to be a very good starting piont for people who would like to begin a study in armor tactics.
3,"Useful, but just for beginners","I am a strategic consultant and I founded the book too simple. It is highly recomended (together with ""Say it with charts"") if you are brand new in a consultancy firm or, because of your job, you occasionally have to do professional presentations and you want to acquire a basic methodology. It is a good book for starters, but presentations is kind of an art and it is a skill difficult to get."
3,Needs more maps,"All in all, this product delivers what it promises, a comprehensive list of hiking trails in the greater san gabriel mountain range. Unfortunately, the directions to these trails are vague, and could easily be misinterpreted. As a whole however, I feel that this book is worth picking up if you enjoy hiking and live in the los angeles county area."
2,Not that great,"This was an OK book...not horrible, but not great. As other people have said, it is definitely not very original. It's good if you are really into that whole vampire thing, but otherwise, I'd get it from the library instead of buying it. I bought the hardcover version, read it in one night, and haven't touched it since."
5,A good debut novel,"In my opinion, this was a very good, suspenseful book. I havebeen writing stories for years and ,judging from this novel,a lot ofwork went into it. The story is set in the past and present and givesan accurate enough representation of both time periods. All of the charactors were painted somewhat faded, but clear enough that the reader will be able to understand their motives and their personalities. I enjoyed this book because it was suspenseful and kept me wondering what would happen next. I read it straight through in about 2 hours because I couldn't make myself put it down. Buy this novel if you haven't already, it's great for anyone, including me and I usually don't like books like this. I hope to be able to read more books by Amelia Atwater-Rhodes in the future."
1,Very disappointing,"I heard about this book through the massive media attention it got. I saw that the author was supposed to be awesome. So, I picked up a copy and finished it in less than a day. I put it down and thought about it. The more I thought about it, the more I realized I wasted my money. Sure, it's a bunch of pretty words, but the words don't mean anything! I disagree when everyone says she is a great author. Sure, its her first book, but c'mon when I was that young I could write a lot better than that. The characters seemed to try to be emotionally challenged, but they ended up looking stupid...The whole tiger thing didn't make sense. Sorry, but I expected better. A lot better."
2,A mediocre book with mediocre feeling...,"If anything, the only thing that this book lacked was emotion. You have the tortured heroine, the crafty (and slightly alluring) villian, the tearing of the main character's very being... But no substance. Miss Rhodes does show promise, but so far all I'm seeing is potential. The follow up to 'In the Forests of the Night', 'Demon in My View' is much better, I'd say. In the time between the two books she really honed her skills and came out with a suprisingly well done book. In this book, the characters seem forced and stereotypical, arrogant and dull. Don't get me wrong, I'd still say it was worth a read, but allow yourself the dissapointment only once."
5,I loved it.,"I'm a 16-year-old girl who was in awe reading this book. The detail was so perfect that the entire world created seemed frighteningly realistic. I was amazed that someone of this age was capable of writing this, let alone having the ability to locate a publisher.The story follows a vampire that you begin to feel sympathetic for, and as the story continues you wish that you could help her through her difficult life. And while vampires may not actually exist this book brings them to life in such a way that they seem like anyone else that you would see while walking down the street.I was also inspired by the fact that this 13-year-old was able to create this entire world hidden behind our own and make it seem so real."
2,Weak and gimmicky,"In the Forests of the Night is disappointing on many levels, not the least of which is the fact that any attention commanded by this poorly executed and hackneyed first effort stems solely from the fact of its author's tender age. This serves not only as a gimmicky lapel-grabber (""Wow, she's good _for her age_!""), but also to deflect criticism of the story (""Well, so it's not that great. But she's good _for her age_"").I don't doubt that young people can write just as well as older authors, but this smacks of a publicity stunt (particularly since this ""Carol Sutch"" is listed as co-author). Plaster her face in Seventeen and Teen People and watch the borderline-illiterate teenyboppers come a-runnin'. I pity Ms. Atwater-Rhodes; like teen idols of popular music, she will now never be allowed to grow artistically. Her credibility is shot."
3,"Good, but....","""In the Forests of the Night"" is a pretty good attempt for an author of such a young age, but I really thought the book could have been a LOT longer. When I reached the end of the book, I was a bit shocked that she would have picked such a sudden way to end the book, summing up the whole story in two pages. It was a good book, though, for someone her age."
3,IN THE FORESTS OF THE NIGHT-AMELIA ATWATER-RHODES,"Risika a vampire, was once known as Rachel, a young Puritan girl who was taken upon by evil. Now, in the present day, she finds the one that had captured her, Audrey, is back...Very well written for a 13-year old. The way she did the chapters was interesting, like how one was in the present and the other was in 1706, when she was ""turned"". Overall it was OK."
5,Verry hard to put down!,"This book was awsome, i read it 5TIMES! It is about a girl who gets caught up in troble and becomes a vampier, she has to work through obsticals to understad what happend to her. The book's chapters go from NOW to 1701. I could not put it down."
3,"Enjoyable, but...","I very much enjoyed this book, for what reasons, I don't know. Although, albeit that there were a couple of things about the style of writing. (i.e. some of her intro paragraphs that lead into another scene seem a little out of place and awkward, like she didn't know how to get there.) But, it's a hard thing to do. And for her age, that is very good, I hope someday I might be able to get a book published. It's weird b/c I like this book, yet I don't. It's one of those ones where you don't know if you like it or not, but read it over and over again."
4,Beautifully done to entrap new readers,"in the forests of the night was beautifully written to ensnare young people into the wonderful world of their imaginatioin. Most children stop reading for pleasure near fifth or sixth grade due to time or non-intrest. This fast easy-read novel takes you in grips you buy the mind and drags you off into the dark world of vampires. Risika is very real. You believe in her and everyone else around her. The characters each have a very complex nature, yet Amelia sends that message across loud and clear. I am a fan of vampiric novels and this is high on my list. As long as she keeps writing her growth in the art of writing will help others grow in reading. I love the way she used her minimalistic way of writing."
5,Spectacular -- A Must-Read!,"Amelia Atwater-Rhodes weaves a compelling tale of mystery, fate, and supernatural powers! Risika, who was unwillingly tranformed into a vampire 300 years ago, must learn to stand up to Aubry, her powerful blood-brother and rival. In the process, she learns to except what she has become, and stumbles across the truth of her human brother's ""death."" In this thrilling story is a smooth blend of hate, love, life, death, and being able to respect yourself for who you are. You don't have to be a vampire-lover to enjoy this book -- read it today!"
2,don't stay in your toes,"I don't know if I'm doing something wrong but these won't stay put at all. Makes them completely useless. I don't know, maybe my toes aren't close enough together?"
5,Awesome,This CD is awesome. Two Hookers And An Eight is an awesome new song. This CD is definetly worhte the money. It's only twenty-two minutes long but that dosen't matter because you can just listen to it over and over.
3,Messed up,"This album is short. I mean really short. You can listen to the entire thing in like 20-25 min. The sound quality [stinks]. And you can barely understand what they are saying. So why should you buy this? Because it is so messed up and wrong that it's awsome. This album is screwed up. You've got ""Thank God"", a song that pokes fun at the rappers at award shows who always thank God for their lyrics, even though they sing about drugs and sex and killing. Then there's Panty Shot. The most unbelievably wrong song ever. I'll tell you this much, the song is about a guy and a 5-year old girl. Sick sick stuff. But, it's like, forget what everyone else things, they do their own thing and that's cool. This album is great. Buy it if you like MSI. If you've never listened to them before, get Frankenstein Girls Seem Strangely Sexy first."
3,no longer curious about the curio,"Extreme packaging, poor instructions and a mess of styrofoam. The base was misdrilled so that the posts are different distances from the edge, and one door is too close to its adjacent post. I contacted the company about clarifying the assembly instructions, but didn't hear back. Position the posts (holes inward) to allow the tracks to hold the mirrors/front glass. Add to step 1: install the front glass & magnets. Many of the drilled holes weren't cleaned out making it difficult to secure the screws into the cam nuts. Other curios I've assembed had screws securing the bottom and top, rather than mere dowels. It is an attractive cabinet; but before you buy it, consider going to your local furniture store and buying a pre-assembled curio."
5,This CD rocks !!!,"I got an advance copy of this album and I was amazed with the raw power on this album. This is by far the best album Marky Ramone has delivered since the Ramones called it quits. Forget about the Intruders, this is real rock and roll ! A real rollercoaster to hell, hard guitars, nuclear drums and a voice that spits out all the anger. I am sure some people will hate this record but I love it. After hearing this I can't wait for Marky and his new band to record another fine album !"

5,This Is E LEEEET!!!!!,"Dude, this album completely kicks everyone's ass. It's a masterpiece, wonderfully arranged, mixed, and produced, and the sound is pure Funker Vogt. YEEHAWW. However, there is a problem. Who the hell does the sound clips for you guys at Amazon? These problems are too drastic to ignore:1. The clip for ""Date of Expiration"" - Is this a joke? You put in the intro of the song without even playing any of the song???? How the hell do you expect someone to know what the song sounds like if you only play the damned intro? It's just a rising crescendo building to the main part of the song!!!2. Compulsion - WHAT THE HELL?????? IT'S NOT THE RIGHT SONG!!! HELL, IT'S NOT EVEN THE RIGHT BAND!!!! THIS IS RIDICULOUS AND INEXCUSABLE.Love the album. Buy 6 copies. Give 5 of them to random people."
5,New perspective on the true value of the customer you hate,Burkan has done a nice job in reminding us about the value of our most irritating customer and our peskiest employee. Pay attention to them! They point us to new markets and new opportunities to create value for our stakeholders
2,2 Stars because of the remix.,"And that is a good thing. This song is annoying and seems to bring down Faith Hill to youth pop territory. This song came out when Britney's debut album was doing well and if Britney had done it, it would have been a better fit and not sounded so annoying. I think Mrs. Hill should have kept her focus on Country. Yes I like Britney, but I would hate to think Faith Hill was trying to ride the youth pop wave of the time.Now about the remix. Love II Infinity do the honors, and while DMA magazine's reviewer lamented the remix sounding too much like 1996 with it's 'tinkly pianos', I do enjoy it and it seems to give a more mature sound to the song and Hill's vocal."
5,"Superb New Album from Dio, Even better than Magica!!","Well, this is a suprise. Not only did we get the wonderful Magica in 2000 which was a return to form in itself but now we get a total Heavy Metal album which sounds like prime 80s dio but with a better production. I mean that everything sounds more meaty whereas Holy Diver etc had quite a thin sound.There are so many great songs on this album that you have to buy it!!! Its the best album ive heard in a long time, i cant wait to see dio tour this album it will be unbeleivable."
2,"Its not bad, but its not the quality DIO that we all rock...",to. Its not a bad CD is the first thing I want to point out. But it is nothing compared to Majica/HD/LIL. RJD on this CD is to damn repetitive sounding on 75% of his songs...
3,Ronnie James Dio,"This is a really good effort by DIO. I enjoyed it, but I think RJD's longtime nemisis, Ozzy, has one up one him with the new stuff."
1,Utter junk,"Broke immediately upon first use. Not suitable for its intended purpose, or any purpose. Junk to the point of being theft."
3,Looks good if we could put it together,"We bought seven Powell Monster bedroom furniture items. It is a good sturdy product but the ""some assembly required"" has resulted in issues with five of the seven pieces we purchased. In the case of the chair, the screws don't actually attach to anything, something is clearly missing, a part like a screw insert for the bolts to screw into? They sent us a chair seat to replace the one that was not finished. The underbed storage was out of square by a half inch, the screws on the handles of the desk and rolling storage are cheap and over-tightened, one screw broke, and two had to be drilled out. The rolling bench has a drawer that is ""stuck"" and none of the wheel plates aligned with all four bolt holes. It's a shame that such a nice product has such basic issues."
1,DONT SPEND OUR MONEY!!!,The Paper goes in great if you dont want any pictures on it... OH WAIT the point of it is to put pictures in it!!!!! Dont even think of buying this. It DOESNT WORK... It doesnt even deserve 1 star.
4,One of the best!,"I got this camcorder only a few weeks ago, but I am in love! It works great and is everything it is sold as. The low Lux is great. The batteries (extra batteries) are very expensive, but are light and quick to charge. Image quality is sharp/crisp. It is just a fun little camera."
5,This is easily my favorite book!,"For those of you who gave this book 1 star, did you read the same book I did? From the first time I read it, I was hooked. My edition has pages falling out of it from reading it so much and I can quote passages! It's such a captivating tale that connects the t.v. plot lines fluidly! Fantastic! If only the show had reamined true to the book! How much do I admire Peter David?! He's fantastic, and this book reflects that!"
3,"Predictable, actionless, then finally interesting","This was the first Star Trek book I'd ever read, although I have been a long-time fan of the show. I was surprised to find that right away I could see how the entire book would unfold. Getting to the interesting stuff took me through alot of pages of romantic stuff that I found boring, since we know how things turn out for Riker and Troi in the end. I found no suspense in reading how these two people first fornicated (or ""became lovers"" if you prefer). The three stars I give the book are earned by some interesting and exciting events in the last 20 pages or so. I think you have to really like Riker and Troi to enjoy this book."
1,A Mom's skeptical review . . . .,"This is not worth the money, do not buy this. It is a bad recording and you are better off going to Napster or Wal-Mart.com and downloading the ""classic"" recordings of the songs played on this CD (you know Gene Autry- Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer and Brenda Lee- Rockin Around the Christmas Tree) it really is not a good Christmas CD."
1,Where's William Hung?,"yes, it's true. I would rather listen to a collection of all the rejects from American Idol, even the rejects from the auditions, than this crap. The two front teeth song is supposed to be sung by a five-year-old. Since all their other crap is sung by five-year-olds, you think they could manage that. WRONG!!!!!!!!!!!!!they pull in teenagers! geez, they need to learn exactly what talent is. Free voice lessons to all the suckers who sing this!!!!!!!"
4,Good,The CD came in excellent condition as rated by the seller. The CD only gets 4 stars because some of the song were a little different than the traditional Christmas songs I have heard. All in all a good CD though.
5,A Musical Joy!,"Children love to hear other children sing, all the more reason my 4 year old LOVES this cd. She is in pre-k, and lot of these songs are very familiar to her. So when I popped this in for the first time in the car, she was thrilled...plus I get the pleasure of hearing her sing along with all of her ""favorites""!!"
5,The Best Book in the World!,"When I went to Berkeley with my mom, she bought me this wonderful book at the bookstore. I started it that day and finished it the next day. I thought it was a brilliant story and my friends and mom want to read it, too. I highly recommend this story, Wishes, Kisses, and Pigs to anyone who loves to read a good, entertaining, well-written book."
5,Summary,My dad bought this for me when I was 15. My very first boyfriend and I danced to this over and over when he would come to see me. Lots of good memories. I'm just thrilled to find another copy!
4,good watch,I bought this watch a month ago and i was pleased with what i received. The watch looks realy luxurious and i could say that it looks like unisex watch. The quality was good and it made a perfect gift for my brother.
1,Don't waste your money,"It's all about a karate lesson going on, and someone video taped it. Those rate 4 stars and above are probably people in the classes who bought it for their own collection. The whole show was shot under poor lighting (I think he does not want the distract the class that was going on.) and quite blurry."
1,Not working,I also had high hopes for this product. I took per directions for a week and then I took it at the directions for the heavier weight. I did not see an improvement at all. It did give me and my baby awful gas. I would talk to your lactation consultant for better prodects.
5,Worked for me!,"I had low milk supply and with pumping after each nursing, this made a difference for me! Only it is inconvenient that you have to take without much water, but it's worth the result"
5,Great product!,"I was struggling with low milk production. My daughter's pediatrician recommended these pills and after reading the great reviews, I ordered them. The first day I took them, my milk production doubled! I was relieved, and my daughter was very happy. I have been taking them regularly as indicated and my milk production has remained steady. I am grateful for this wonderful product!"
3,Didn't work for me,I was really hoping this product would work for me since I read all the positive reviews and I'm really trying to breastfeed exclusively but I'm sad to inform it didn't do a thing for me.
2,"May work, but makes baby unbearably gassy","I tried this product in the hopes of making more milk for my 5 week old daughter. After taking just 3 sets of pills, she became so unbearably gassy that I had to stop taking them. She then returned to her normal happy self. I did see a slight increase in milk production in the short time I took the pills, but it's just not worth it to me to have a screaming baby who is in great pain when she is normally happy. I had to dump all the extra milk I had pumped anyway."
5,worked for me,"I started using More Milk Special Blend, which is supposed to increase the amount of tissue in the breast for women whose breasts did not increase much in size for lactation. This worked well -- I visited a lactation consultant before I started to take it and two weeks after. Based on precise weight measurements of my baby before and after the feedings, we found that I produce 1 oz more milk at one feeding than I had before taking the supplement. After about a month and a half I switched to More Milk Plus and that has been working well too. In the last two months my baby has gone up 30 percentiles for weight, in part because of the supplement."
2,Didn't work for me.,"Unfortunately this product did not work for me. I will not be purchasing this product again. A friend of mine did use this product, and it did work for her. If you want to spend the money, go for it. It's worth a shot, but don't expect much. I really had my hopes up."
3,Great Product,"I saw a clear difference in my milk production when I was using these pills but only during my peek production months. Unfortunately if you stop producing an adequate amount of milk to sustain your little ones eating patterns like me, no matter how many pills you take it won't increase your flow by that much."
1,Didn't Seem to Work for Me,My supply was low from the get go so I took recommendations from friends. This didn't seem to help me much at all and I ended up on a prescribed medication to help get things flowing. I have heard many good things from other people but it did not do the trick for me.
4,"Good product, but misleading","Overall this is a pretty good thing to buy for your Palm. Especially if you are sick of all those fingerprints on your screen! But, the writeright screen protecters are great for graffiti recognition but decrease screen readability by 10 fold. But, if you just cut them to fit the graffiti area they are great! And also note that there are not 12 writerights there are four for Palms, four for just the Palm V, and four for CE divices. The BrainWASH concept is great and makes your screen look like new! Enjoy and note the great price here on Amazon!"
4,Excellent product!,"After reading some of the reviews, I was a bit concerned, but I don't notice any significant reduction of screen clarity. I don't have to worry about damaging my screen anymore, even when using my finger. The surface is also textured, which greatly improves graffiti recognition. They are also very durable and last WELL over a month. The only drawback is that putting them on is a real pain, and you can never accomplish it without getting some annoying air bubbles in the process. Overall, a wonderful product!"
1,Forget this unless you're extremely careless,"I bought this item and stopped using it because it reduces the clarity of the screen image. It also seems to make the screen less sensitive for writing. As for protection, I've used my Palm for 3 months without using the protectors and have not scratched the surface. I don't believe you can scratch the surface with the stylus unless you're extremely careless.I do keep the plastic cover on the unit, and I have bought the case made out of wetsuit material. Any scratches are likely to come from something other than the stylus, in my opinion, so the cover and a case are important items."
1,Not for color,This isn't good for color units. It makes the screen unreadable on my Prism. Too bad they don't have a version for color screens!
1,Insult to the holly Virgin,I saw the production and I am not prepared to buy an opera which includes an insult to the Virgin Mary.Jaime Fuenzalida
4,Survived 1800F fire!!!!!,"House burned down last night. Lost everything. There amongst the ashes stood this pillar. Inside all my guns were safe and intact. I was even more amazed to find gram's old double barrel thoroughly clean, barrels shiney and lubed. I dug further and was amazed to see that my cherished AR had been polished, bolt carrier cleaned and bent firing pin replaced. Should have put the wife in there, maybe a few years would have come off, lol. Gotta admit for what I paid this locker turned out to be a dousey of a buy!"
4,Nice starter engine for your HO train set,"I bought this engine in building (or re-building, I should say) my model railroad setup. I was interested in getting a less expensive engine that would still do the job of going around the Christmas tree while pulling a number of cars. This engine fit the bill nicely, and is also nicely detailed. I've got it pulling 5 rolling stock cars plus a caboose, and it easily has the power to do so. I paired it with Kato Unitrack, which is really high quality as well, and an MRC Tech 4 260 controller, which I also highly recommend. I suggest buying rolling stock (train cars) that have metal wheels and are weighted, as they are better quality and run better than the cheaper stuff that comes in the all-in-one sets. Sorry for the all encompassing review, but hopefully it help those of you looking to build a train set who want higher quality than the run of the mill sets that are out there."
1,easily earns less than one star,Because of a love for the Destroyer series I foolishly ignored all the bad reviews here and picked up this book based on the couple of semi-positive ones.Big mistake. This book is BAD. It is clear that this is a case where the majority is right. I should have listened to the amazon reviews. Steer clear if you are a true fan.
4,Entertaining,"Despite the negative reviews, I found The Destroyer #132 (Wolf's Bane) very entertaining. I've read over a hundred of the Destroyer series paperbacks and found this one in tune with the story and just as good as any of the others. It's worth the reading if you indeed enjoy the Destroyer series."
1,Shorted out after 2 months of light use,"This curling iron worked well for my thick, fine textured, very long hair until it shorted out only TWO MONTHS after buying it. I used it maybe twice a week at most. Also, the dial for the temperature changed easily when I was using it because my hand was constantly bumping it. Last but not least, the cord tangled horribly. It's a shame because the curling iron actually curled fairly well. I won't buy a product from this manufacturer again and I'm looking for a new curling iron."
3,Pros: Gets Hot Quick. Cons: Not very durable.,"This product is leaps and bounds above it's other price-range curling irons - it gets very hot relatively quickly and is pretty easy to use.Unfortunately you do get what you pay for (and I was ripped off paying $45 at the beauty store for it.) After about 2 days of use, there was a short in the rotating cord and if the iron is held at an odd angle, it turned off. It was still usable, but I had to modify the way I curled my hair to avoid it turning off and losing heat. After about 6 months, you can see the ceramic coating chipping off a little - and I used the iron about 3-4x per month.If you're in the market for a cheap curling iron - I would suggest this because compared to the Revlon, Remington and Conair brands I've had in the past, this is the closest to a high end curling iron among them - most likely you will have better luck with your iron than I did."
1,Ceramic?,Ok whats going on with ceramic products.This is the second product I bought that the ceramic is chipping or changing color.This curling iron was working nicely at first. It got hot right away and then it wouldnt heat up at all. the off and on buttons are touch sensitive so you have to keep checking to see if the iron is still on. I have had better luck with Hot tools brand for curling irons but Babyliss has the best flat irons. Titanium of course.
2,Dual Voltage Curling Iron,"I bought this to take on a trip to Europe, but ended up leaving it at home. The unit is too big and heavy to be practical for travel."
5,Curling Iron,"I purchased this curling iron after reading reviews and it is is just like I expected... WONDERFUL. It is very light, durable and does a great job. I am very pleased and would recommend this to anyone!"
2,Just not good,"Most importantly, the iron doesn't get that hot. I want to see smoke after a minute because that's what 400F should do! The stand gets way too hot because it rests on the iron. The on off switch is poorly located so you inadvertently end up turning off the iron or lowering the heat setting while trying to load your hair. Whack!"
1,Deceptive,This curling iron was advertised to have dual voltage. I was traveling to Ireland and did not want to ruin my curling iron so I thought I would buy one that I could use there.When it arrived the plug was no different than the current US voltage. I am leaving tomorrow and have no curling iron. I am outraged with disapointment.
4,Great dual voltage for traveling,"We travel a lot and my wife hates having to take adapters and such. Since her curling iron was the only thing we needed it for, we purchased this. Works great for several months, my wife say she will stick with this brand."
3,Is this a Chi or not?,"I just ordered this, so I have not received it yet...but as I am looking at this I am beginning to wonder why it says on the produt title ""Ceramic Tools CT125S 1-1/4"" Dual Voltage Professional Ceramic Spring Curling Iron by CHI"" But I researched the product code CT125S & its coming up with Conair & Babyliss! I am not happy about that. I did not want either one. So now I have to wait till it comes in & turn around & send it back. Why would Amazon advertise this & then say its by Chi?"
3,Not that Great,"This protects nice, make it easier to write, but it's got air bubbles all over the place when I tried to put it on... you either need a lot of practice or live with the bubbles.. it could also be that I suck at putting it on."
4,Works for all SCREENS!,"THis works Great. Fellowes made a great product this time. it surly protects the screen, and it makes the device look like you just took it out of the box. It works great on my dads iPAQ and if your and iPod user it works even better! when i used it on the my iPOD, I was able to cover the whole thing! it also works for cell phones, video/Cameras, And PSP's (playstation portable)! It also comes with a Special little Squweegee card that helps prevent Air bubbles! However it takes about one or two hours to install it (very frustrating) if your a first time user. Otherwise its a great product!"
2,"Ok, but does not fit all Casiopeias",Claims to fit Casio Cassiopeias and other Pocket PC PDAs. Had to cut it to fit my Cassiopeia. It does protect the screen well although it does get marked up pretty quickly. As well it is had to get off cleanly and the put another one on.
2,Can't stand that label at the bottom of the protector,"I think that it is terrible that Fellows put a label at the bottom of this protector. Protectors are great as long as they are not obstructing the view of the screen. Unfortunately, Fellows didn't think that was very important.Plus the bubbles are really hard to get our, but that is the same problem with all screen covers that I have seen."
4,"Cheap, Good Quality Watch!!!","Very good quality watch, not as much options with it, but very good over all cheap and good looking. A-"
1,"Good accuracy, fragile sensor","Finally popped on the good pipe clamp and busted it on first use. Maybe it caught on a bad sweat joint or something, but broke none the less. Would recommend being extremely careful if you get one. I'm back to taping on bead probes or using a laser temp gun. Wish it was a little more durable."
1,Worst baby tub ever!,"I've had many styles of baby tubs, and several hard tubs similar to this one. This is the worst, and the main reason is the ledge is too short, one kick and he goes right over the top which makes him fall into the water. He's 5 weeks, and though I can see maybe this would work for an older baby, it does not work for a younger baby. It is also much deeper than our previous tubs, and when he goes over the ledge his head goes under the water. I end up only filling it half way. I also don't like the hard shell much for this age, as when he startles he hits his head and cries. We're changing over to a tub sling instead. I don't recommend this tub because it is not safe for a young baby!"
1,Don't buy it,"Don't choose this tub. I've given up on it. My 5 month old cries every bath, and I'm sure its because of the tub. It is so ""unergonomically"" correct. She literally floats up and her little bottom ends up squarely on the ""hump"" of the seat, where the knees are supposed to be."
1,Do Not Buy,This item comes from diaper.com and they have a horrible return policy. If you get this as a gift you will not be given any credit for your return. Do not use them!
1,Please stop making movies like this.,"The premise sounds good, and Eddie Griffin has the potential to be a likable character, but he isn't in this. They don't take enough time to develop his, or any other character. This really seemed rushed and thrown together and is not worth watching."
5,So far so good,"I've been waiting for the price to go down on DL dvd's for a year. Finally the price is close enough to $1/disc to justify buying them. I'm surprised a good brand like memorex was the first to go this low (that I could find at least). Couple with amazon's free shipping, this is it! I might be a little premature in writing this as I've only burned 5 DVD's, but so far so good! I haven't been able to play them in one of the really ancient DVD players I have (about 5 years old), but this one won't play any of my other burned DVDs anyway. The other DVD player I have, about 3 years old, plays them just fine. I will definately be buying more of these, and I'm sure the price will keep going down now that DLs are coming into the mainstream."
5,GREAT,"THIS IS A GREAT CD! I LIKE IT BECAUSE OF ITS MESSAGE, ITS COOL BEAT, AND YOCHANANS TALENT! IT TALKS ABOUT EVERYTHING ISREAL NEEDS TO KNOW IN ITS WALK WITH YAWEH!!!NINA KONIUCHOWSKY"
3,OK BUT!!,"I love the characters but, too many ...confusing to say the least. The books would be better with less characters. Also the cats and dog need to interact more."
4,Indispensable guide to Rome's forgotten milennium,"Too many histories jump lightly and quickly from the grandeur of pagan Rome to the grandeur of Renaissance and Baroque Rome --ignoring the thousand year artistic and architectural history in between. This book fills in a long and fascinating gap in the history; and brings to our attention works of art that, if they are outshone by the splendours before and after, are not to be despised. The only problem with this book is the relative paucity of pictures and plans, and the absence of any in colour. If printing photographs or reproductions is expensive, why can't they provide a DVD to go with the book?"
2,Not very useful,"The first star is for an interesting background on the Irish language. The second star is for the web addresses included in the book, which took me to some useful sites on Irish language. But that's all it gets - as a book to learn a language from it is not well written, especially for beginners. It doesn't give you all the vocabulary you need and assumes a lot of knowledge of grammatical terminology - nor are the exercises particularly good. I came away with the impression that Irish would be way too hard for me to learn because of its extremely complex grammar, which I'm sure was not the author's intent."
3,ok,"Didn't pay much so can't really complain, but the book is pretty worthless without the audio CD, which broke the first time I put it in my player."
1,DO NOT BUY,This looks great but you cannot get out of the bedroom before the static starts. Spend a little more money and buy a better one. There is no need to waste your time with this one...
4,Good,It was a good story if you like time travel pieces. It was a bit slow in the middle as some are but the ending made up for it. I always love a good scottish novel :)
4,Slow to start but a beautiful ending,I took a while to get into this story but when I did I was so glad I persevered. It was a beautifull ending and well worth the wait.Alisdair MacAuley is sent forward in time to change history even though he doesn't it. He thinks he is in a powerful scorceress castle when he meets Morgan Lafayette.Thank you Claire for giving us this story.
2,Strong Content...Poorly Written,"I have been an Oracle DBA for more than 15 years, and certified in multiptle Oracle versions. I have read a good number of the Oracle Press books. It is as if this book never went through the editing process. The content is there, but the explanations of the new feature are so poor in some cases that it was easier to go to the Oracle Online Documents.I should have waited for the Oracle9i Exam Cram to come out!"
1,"Poor, especially when compared to previous OCP exam guides","I am sorry I waited the extra two months for this book to be published. I am an OCP DBA on 7.3 and above, and have always used the Oracle Press books as a major source for my studying. Previous books were written by Jason Couchman and were quite good. This book is not. I have only completed 2 of the 6 chapters so far, but have found numerous mistakes, and chapter study questions with incorrect answers! Unfortunately I no longer trust this book to prepare me for the exam- in fact I am tempted not to finish it. Save your money."
2,"Good book, but not enough for exam!!","Its not a bad book, easy reading, good structure. Has nice CD-rom testing software.But let me tell you.. its not nearly detailed enough. I just took the OCP 9i and you need to cover way more material than is covered in this book. I'd say 50% of the exam is in this book, so that is not very good coverage."
5,Straight A's,"I loved this book. (Some people think that I am like Millie, but I'll take that as a complement.)Millicent Min is really smart, and really dumb at the same time. She's only 11, but taking a class in college for the summer. All her friends are adults, until she meets Emily. She lies to Emily and almost loses her as a friend. The book is about truth and friendship. And it's really funny, though some parts are very sad and almost made me cry."
5,Amazing Story,"While reading this book, I could feel Immaculee's pain. This book was so touching. It made me want to meet Immaculee in person. I felt so bad as she lost her family to the Rwanda genocide. This was an awful tragedy that I will never forget.Very good read."
5,Desert experience for the truly intrepid traveller,"If you ever dreamed of crossing the desert on a camel, but will likely never really do it, this is about as close as you can get to truly being there... and maybe as close as you would WANT to get. Liberally sprinkled with suspense, humour, history, personal revelation and surprises, this book is a must for the armchair adventurer who wants to know what it's really like to travel the desert with ancient nomadic tribes. A compelling and illuminating read!"
5,Great Book,A Great Book... Gregory David Roberts really has a knack of writing. He does a phenomenal job of bringing the characters to life and gets the reader involved into the story. He vividly describes life in India .. and with great accuracy.A lot of really good one liners ... phrases that could each lead to deep philosophical discussions.A must read ..
3,"Great story, shame about the writing","I'm halfway through Shantaram and I am enjoying it - it helps that I'm actually travelling through India while reading it. However, every so often, I have to put it down to digest prose that is so purple, I'm caught between nausea and the giggles.It's a shame, as the story itself is so compelling and exciting (even though occasionally it seems to be just a series of vignettes); it could have benefited from sparse, stark writing. So an average of three stars from me - for a five star read on India, I'd suggest the White Tiger."
2,Disappointed,"This book came highly recommended and the back cover and first few sentences of the story hooked me, but for me, it did not hold up. I could find no discernible plot. It jumped from one ""remembrance"" to another. It also seemed like a philosophy book thrown in. It became a little laughable how almost every referral to Carla started with one of her wise sayings. Toward the beginning of the book, I enjoyed reading about an entirely different culture, but those insights drifted off and never really returned. After about 500 pages, I looked longingly at the unread books on my bookshelf. I had to keep going with Shantaram, however. because I picked it for our Book Club. I hope I'm not tossed out after our next get together!"
1,Awful!,"Pseudo-philosophical and ultraviolent, laughable and extremely poorly written, I couldn't stop shaking my head while reading Shantaram. As an autobiography, the author is extremely conceited, and he paints a ridiculous portrait of Lin, the leading man: part Commando warrior, part junkie, part saint.... As for the writing, the imagery is histerically bad, you'll be groaning not-stop every time you read a description of Karla's beauty. I could go on and on: what about the contrived quotes that the author sprinkles the book with (""as Karla/Didier/... once said, bla bla bla ...""). What a pity I don't have the book with me right now to give some examples... And the philosophy is just pages and pages of tedious pretense that the author pounds our head with.I am baffled by the positive reviews this novel has received. For me Shantaram was a waste of precious time."
5,"For the romantic, without the blah","Beautiful book on many different levels. Thought-provoking, educational, escapist, yet grounded. Demonstrates the human condition without moping, imparts a point-of view that perserveres."
3,"Overwrought, Middling Adventure Story. Read ""A Fine Balance"" Instead!","This is probably the worst book I've finished in a very long time. The adventure is decent; the minute details of the author's feelings and perceptions are not. Florid, ridiculous paragraphs heap a thousand words on every glance, every new acquaintance--and look out when he actually touches someone! Rather than devote so much time to purple prose, he would have done better to supply factual research about the culture and history of India and its people. That would have been more engaging, more interesting and more worthwhile. As it is, we get just a glimpse of India without any context that goes beyond what he can see with his own eyes.Those looking for a more concise, more insightful and certainly more rewarding bit of literature regarding life in India should ready ""A Fine Balance."""
2,"Loved the first 200 pages, quit after 400","The first part of the book captured my attention. Even though some of it was a bit rough, there was humor and a sense of really seeing a part of India that Westerners don't often encounter. After a while the story darkened but I was still interested. But when I got to a very intense section (I won't give away the plot...) that went on and on and on, I skimmed that section and then I questioned why I would want to spend my time immersed in all that misery. So I quit."
5,Best book I've ever read- and I've read a lot,"I can't believe so many people have such a visceral reaction to this book. It is an amazing read, and a hazard to your work/social/academic life. If you looking for phrases to ridicule and obsessing about technical details, you are missing out on an great story. I know many people don't like the ""politics"" or what is being presented- hero of book is an ex-con escaping prison, heavy drug use, involved in organized crime, gunrunner for mujaheddin against Soviets, etc... If that bothers you enough to prevent the enjoyment of an excellent book, this may not be for you. I was sad when I finished this book years ago, and immediately tried to find another epic book at the same level, and have not found it yet."
2,this book is desperately in need of editing,"This book consists of a series of episodes describing aspects of India life. Some of the episodes are very interesting. Unfortunately, before and after each episode is a long section of purple prose. This book is worth getting only if you are willing to skip over the many sections of very bad writing, reading only about half the book."
2,Over the top fantasy.,"No question about it, Shantaram is a good story. It comes complete with good guys, bad guys, heroes and thugs. Lin, of course, is the requisite superhero, albeit a bit too hard to believe.If the story is indeed autobiographical, it is wildly embellished. If the story is fantasy, it is still over the top. At the end, I still couldn't decide which is a more apt description - which may be the most compelling reason to recommend it."
3,good story line - poor writing,"I read this book while in India and it was perfect for the hours of long bus rides/ waiting around. Roberts is not a great litterary genius and his writing borders on a male Danielle Steel - BUT if you want an intersting story line that will keep you capitivated and can abstain from the cheesy parts of his writing, I recommend this book."
1,Kindle edition not available in South Africa,"Haven't read the book, but would love to.So why the 1 star rating?Because this book, and many, many, others are not available to Kindle users in South Africa (among other places).Amazon says it is due to Publisher/Author copyright restrictions, but the irony is that the Hardcover and Softcover books are available, so how does this work then??Nothing more irritating than hearing about a good read then to find that it's not available to you because you're registered in South Africa.If I'd known about this before buying my Kindle, I probably wouldn't have bought it."
3,Really?,"I read a lot, and love books about India, but seriously, this book does not measure up in any way to ""A Fine Balance"" or ""White Tiger."" The self-absorbed main character has led a colorful life (of crime, drugs, mafia, laced occasionally with healing the sick while living in the slums, befriending the poor & downtrodden) but after a while the minutiae of his days get downright tedious and annoying. Where was an editor for this?"
5,hard to put down,I found this book hard to put down! Gregory David Roberts is a writer with a wonderful way of words and poetry of soul. I found so much humanity in his writing in spite of the often violent and gory scenarios he depicts. I left the book feeling I had met an amazing human being who survived his own particular journey and came out of it with his heart somehow still intact.I know India and have published a novel based on my own very different experiences there. I salute you and thank you for a wonderful read. Blessings
5,Amazing,"Best opening paragraph I have read since ""Tale of Two Cities"". Having been to India a number of times it was wonderful to be able to almost smell the country in the way he writes. His adventures are incredible and if he has done half of what he writes about he is amazing. I highly recommend this book."
3,Dostoevsky Mated with Barbara Cartland,"Overlong, overwritten, over-self-conscious and under-edited, Shantaram is a book that almost sinks under its own weight. While the details on the slums and the criminal underworld of Bombay are fascinating, the second-rate epigrams of Karla and Didier, the endless uncalled-for philosophical symposia, and the final jaunt to Afghanistan all became a bit too much and I was skipping pages by the end. The author has had many unique experiences, but I would have preferred to hear about them without all the fictional-philosophical encrustations. There is an interesting speech on YouTube (search for Gregory David Roberts or Shantaram) where the author recounts some of the same experiences, complete with accents and movement (in particular, head wiggles). It will be interesting to see if the old adage about ""Bad Book = Good Film"" comes true in this case. How on earth can so much be compressed into an 90 minutes?"
4,"Great read, bad writing","Terribly written, at times Roberts is able to squeeze up to five unrelated metaphors into a single paragraph (see below).However, for virtue of the great story and the sheer consistency of the bad writing, although this book will never be a life-changer, it remains a ripping read.Possible candidate for the first movie-was-better-than-the-book award.Excerpt:""I pressed my lips against the sky, and licked the stars into my mouth...Within velvet cloaks of tenderness, our backs convulsed in quivering heat, pushing heat, pushing muscles to complete what minds begin and bodies always win. I was hers. She was mine. My body was her chariot, and she drove it into the sun. Her body was my river, and I became the sea. And the wailing moan that drove our lips together, at the end, was the world of hope and sorrow that ecstasy wrings from lovers as it floods their souls with bliss."" - (Scribe, 2006, p. 400)"
4,This is a keeper !,"Shantaram was suggested by a close friend of mine , having heard so much about the book and also being from south Mumbai I couldn't resist picking up this big book.but believe me once u start reading the story it is so captivating ,U don't feel like putting the book down. The story plot pretty much revolves in and around Mumbai with intricate descriptions of the characters so much so that u feel u r living the story. The best part was the author had added some real life characters too, easy to pick out if u were well versed with Mumbai . Very beautifully done ! This is a keeper."
2,I would purchase the single instead!,The only song really worth buying is on this disk is Aserejé (The Ketchup Song).....everything else is pretty much garbage.
1,"M from Miami, you are wrong","Manuel Saucedo, you ARE mistaken. Catalan is no dialect but the language spoken in Catalonia, Valencia, Balearic Islands (all in Spain),Andorra and some areas of France and an Italian island. The Asereje album is in Spanish except for the ""asereje..."" part which comes from the mispronunciation by some cousing of the Ketchup girls who didn't know English of teh lyrics in a song by some rapper's, I think their name is Sugar Hill Gang and the song is Rapper's delight. OK??"
4,NOT POP BUT GOOD,"I do not know what this other guy is talking about but this cd is not europop. It is more like flamenco and it is entirely in spanish and there are dance songs on it. It is more like spanish pop then europop. If you are buying it expecting to get more songs like the main song which is the best do not. The good thing is that you could consider it like a single. It has the spanglish, spanish, karaoke, and hippi versions of the song. But overall you can open your mind to a new type of music..."
4,yes!,"I don't know all the songs and i don't speak spanish well (i'm in spanish 2 at school) but i do know that Asereje is great. If i'm not mistaken the chorus is taken from a segment a song called ""rappers delight"". Waiting......for new CD. If I, an american who barely knows what they are saying says they are good, then they are!"
5,Our Christmas Favorite,"Just like ""Christmas Story"" and ""National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation"", this compilation of Rat Pack classics has become an absolute favorite and a Christmas ritual. This was the frist Christmas CD my wife and I bought when we got married and with hours of holiday driving to see our families, we have never regretted it. While there are other albums from these artists, it's tough to get such a great collection on a single CD. It would be nice to have a little more from Sammy Davis Jr, but as a whole, this is a fantastic mix, and you won't be disappointed."
4,Underrated,I wonder why it is that the Thompson Twins are virtually forgotten. Granted they were not as big as say the Police. But they made quite a few big hits and they have been virtually ignored by radio stations that purport to play 80's classics.Oingo Boingo also comes to mind.
5,Awesome!,Just finished reading Eli and am awed! Eli is one of the best books that I've read in a long time. The mere thought of Jesus walking this earth in our time was so inspiring. Myers is an excellant author who writes a book with such feeling. Gives a new meaning to WWJD. I would recommend this book to all.
3,"Good characters, bad situations...","I found that I liked the characters in these books (and the companion, dangerous to know). There's a lot of humor and sexual tension, and character interaction is at romance best. I found, however, that the 'spy' situations were unbelievable to the point where they detracted from the story. The heroes were too infallible. The situations they found themselves in were too complex, and then too easily solved.That being said, I love stories that tie together (series), and this is a pretty good series. Good light summer reading."
3,Just ok,"Having read several of Anne Perry's books I love the fact that her books are rich in the details regarding the Victorian era and what it was like to live during that time. However, to me this is becoming more the Charlotte Pitt Mystery series. The villian was too predictable the ending unsatisfacotry and it seemed like Ms. Perry had nothing else to write about so the book just ended. Hopefully the next will be better."
5,"Next to Cater Street, the best Perry I've read","Loved this book - just the right mix of ""moral"" and mystery. I prefer the books where Charlotte and Thomas are both active, and this gives a good mix. The period detail is excellent (as usual)and the mystery is solid too."
2,"Mostly a love story, very little Feynman","To truly appreciate this film one must first read some of Feynman's works. The film speeds through events as if they all took place at the same time, when it's clearly noted that said events took place at different times. In addition the film is primarily based on his relationship with his first wife, and doesn't really go into the mind of Feynman, or show his true genius, and creativity. In addition the film does not portray Feynman properly; it makes him appear as if he's a secluded genius, when in actuality he was very normal.One will appreciate some of the various quotes, and events that you'll immediately note from his lectures, and various books. If you haven't read his works, then you will not be able to appreciate this, which I believe is the only positive this film has."
2,Where's the FEYNMAN?,Glad somebody did it but damn why a love story and a boring one at that which doesn't even show the mans intellect or his very humors nature. Disappointing on so many levels
1,Dont waste your time...,"Poorly written and mediocre acting, a love story as anotherreviewer pointed out; if you want to find out about Feynman,start with Surely you're joking... and work you way to hislectures on QED, social sciences, thinking, or if you are astudent of physics, his famous Physics trilogy. I am sure DrFeynman was never as boring as he is portrayed in this lousyfilm."
5,So detailed! Almost seems real!,This is one of my favorite Amazon purchases to date! This yearbook is complete with classmate signings and photos throughout the year. If you are a big fan of the Buffy TV series this is a must have!
3,Pretty good but . . .,"This ""Yearbook"" has some great photos of the entire cast during the high school years of Buffy TVS. Other than that there's not much going for it. I'm totally into Buffy TVS and I didn't feel particularly drawn to purchse this book. It's pretty good though."
4,"If you like Buffy (and I know you do), just get this","Really funny and witty with a lot of ""inside"" jokes for BtVS fans. The inside is just like a regular high school yearbook for any school...that was built on a hell mouth and had a mortality rate nearly matching its graduation rate. Great color pictures (HS Cordy, need I say more?) and quotes from the 3 best seasons (IMHO) of the late great BtVS. Thank God it lives on in FX reruns about 16 times a day and the DVDs are very reasonably priced."
3,Green house effect.,"I recently watched a screener copy of this film, and I must say it's pretty entertaining. A warning for the average Tom Green fan however, this is Tom Green humor on a leash. Tom really needs to be allowed to reach outside the box for his humor to really take form, and on films like these you can literally see him restraining and thus limiting himself. But a tamed Tom Green is a whole lot better than no Tom Green at all(which has been the case since Stealing Harvard tanked at the box office a number of years ago). So run out and get yourself a copy of Bob the Butler, just don't expect to see horses being masturbated or mice being placed in mouths or bloody bones being licked."
1,no picture,we bought this tv in 2007 and it lasted just this long (4 years) when it did work the picture was good but to spend this kind of money for 4 years of service is ridiculous instead of paying 100$ to have it looked at we used that money for a sony no more samsung for us
2,"Good TV, but it needed service","The video and sound quality on this TV are quite good. About 3 months after purchase, however, the TV began to emit a high-pitched noise after heating up. After being notified of the problem Samsung sent out a repairman a few days later to fix it. Now the noise is gone, but the image on the TV is much darker than before, even after adjusting the settings.Bottom line: Due to the factory defect I would not recommend this TV to anybody. If I could have a redo I would pick a different model."
4,Great balance between cost and quality,"The Samsung LNT3253H 32"" LCD has fabulous color and resolution that comparable units fail to achieve. Many of the other manufacturers that I compared before making this purchase had too much glare and washed out colors. Sound quality could be better, but I'm glad they put the focus on picture quality since you can always use external speakers. Lastly, the unit does give off moderate heat through the louvers at the top rear. If you are going to have this in a picture frame on a wall or a tight fitting entertainment center, I would do some additional research regarding required ventilation and temperature tolerances. Mine is using the stand on a kitchen counter so not a problem for me."
5,Buy This TV,"I have had this TV for 1 month. It is by far better than any other LCD TV I have seen. I only have extended basic cable (no HDTV or digital cable) and the picture is amazing. I also am able to get some HDTV pictures and those are unbelievable. I was so impressed with it that I convinced my best friends to buy one as well. They are also very happy with their purchase. If there are any cons, they are very minor: 1) When you press the power button, it takes a few seconds for the TV to power up and 2) The remote only has a few lighted keys.If you want a 32"" LCD TV, please feel confident buying this one.BTW, I bought this from Amazon (not one of Amazon's partners). Eagle was the delivery source. They were amazing as well. My TV was delivered 1 week ahead of schedule. Everything was great!!!"
3,Closed Caption Problems,"The Samsung LCD TV T3253H has a good picture and sound, BUT the closed captioning goes off and will not come on until you switch to another channel or channels. Since I'm hard of hearing, the CC feature is a must for me. In addition, when the mute is activated, the mute icon flicks up and down and remains on the screen until you do the channel switch as with the CC. After reading some of the reviews about Samsung customer service, I'm sending this TV back to Amazon who have always given good service."
3,It's okay...,"I agree with the other reviewer here. Jack O'Neill is one of my favorite songwriters hands down. Buy Jackopierce's 'Bringing on the Weather' for some of his best stuff. This EP does lack something; perhaps an effort to not sound like Jackopierce is what leaves something to be desired. I will say though that Jack's new record, called ""Halfway Around the World,"" just released (December 2002), is really terrific. Lots of similarities but also some cool differences between his older writing......"
4,Outstanding,"This is a great CD, but I wish he would re release Live at Gruene Hall. That is without doubt the best that I have heard. Black Hat Saloon needs to come out again as well. If anyone has a copy of Live at Gruene Hall they want to sell, Let me know at bobby.hempfling@nokia.com. Rusty, come back up to Poor Davids"
4,Meets Expectations,"As a $25 light-duty radio, it works as expected. It doesn't have cell phone electronics, so instead of holding it like a phone or trying to use it like a speakerphone, it takes a little practice to speak with it in a way that makes it work well (slowing down and giving it's little microphone a chance to send out a loud & clear signal).Our 3rd-grader loves it because he can check in as he roams around the neighborhood. We haven't started to push the range yet, but given the terrain and urban RF noise around here, I'll be impressed if it can hold up for more than a few miles."
1,TERRIBLE!,I will be returning these. We followed the instructions perfectly. We cannot hear each other unless you put your mouth right on it and then you cannot understand anything. Do not buy these!
2,Horrible reception,"We got these because one of our older radios broke. The reception was poor, we tested many different channels and it was very difficult to hear someone only 50 feet away. Our older radio (the one still working) had clear reception and clairty. We were very disappointed as we purcased these for a family road trip for which we caravaned. We would have been better off just using cell phones or writing notes and holding them out the window. We are not technically challenged so I don't think it was an ""end-user-error"". I would like to return these but my husband wants to keep figuring out why they don't work well. Vibrate feature didn't work consistently after setting it up a few times. Why 2 stars, the design is nice."
4,A Must Read for Church Leaders & Church Planters,"I would recommend using reading this book with a highlighter and a notepad. I highlighted key thoughts on just about every chapter, and also wrote out new ideas for our evangelism program. I just placed an order for more copies last week, for the Evangelism Leadership Team at our church. Together, we will review and discuss several chapters in the book. You will be challenged to ensure that you have a well-defined evangelistic strategy with a clearly-known pupose. If you're a church leader, I know you'll agree - ""There is always room for improvement"". Do you want to be challenged? Do you want your creativity and motivation for reaching the lost, kicked up a few notches? Then get a copy of this thought provoking book. Are you and your church really doing all you can with His help to reach the lost? augiechavez@earthlink.net"
2,Not a historical text,"I admit, that the authors show careful research and a good deal of work. However, they ruin any historical credibility that they might have. They constantly use terminology that states their peronsal opinions, thereby causing this text to not be truly factual/historical. Opinions have no place in fact or good history!"
5,Excellent Overview,"I enjoyed this book, it had a little of everything. If you have ever thought of sailing around the world it gives you a good idea what to expect. They saw the world and got out of the horrible world of the working man. If ever you thought that it is something you would want to do read this book."
3,Nothing special,"They looked cool(ish) and fit the theme for our big event. Wedding stuff is over priced and this is not exception. The rings are novel but cheap metal. The glass is just fine but nothing special (not crystal). They come in a velvet lined box which can be used for display later. It is what it is. One drink, snap some pics and but them in the closet."
2,Her play.,"The piano play of Mari Kodama in this disc is too strong or too rough to me. In other words, her play does not fit at least to my favor, unfortunately."
1,Received WRONG item!,"Horrible dealing with this store. I received the wrong item, correct item listed on packing slip. However, Wrong item sent."
1,A disgrace to Australian literature,"I've had to edit this review because the last one was lame.In summary Glenn had a cockroach surgically removed from his ear. Glenn would have made it number 1 on Adolf's list for sure, don't read this book whatever you do."
4,Gershwins supressing release of 1959 Porgy and Bess,"According to Howard Pollack's 2006 biography ""George Gershwin, His Life and Work"" page 654, Ira and Leonore Gershwin recalled the film in 1972 when Goldwyn's lease expired. They felt that the movie was a ""Hollywoodization"" of the opera. They now aquire any prints they find and destroy them. However, they occasionally allow screenings, including one at the 1998 Gershwin Centennial Festival at Brooklyn College. The Gershwin's nephew and executor is Michael Strunsky. If the movie is ever going to be released on DVD, someone would have to convince him."
3,Just not discribed properly!,Hi I was thrilled to get this DVD.........but the quality. This is a direct take of a film is that bad for some NO but for me I was hoping for a remarsted recording. I thought the days of bad presentation where over? It appears not. Yes I'm happy to relive the experence I wish it had been cleaned up.
5,What!?!,"have read many, many blogs regarding the movie Porgy and Bess and find it absolutely ridiculous that with all of this ""technology"" we can get a clean and distributable copy of this movie. Surely if we can see Stormy Weather from 1943, we can restore Porgy and Bess that was filmed in 1959. People of the universe, let's revolt!!!"
3,"The book itself is great, the state it was in.. not so much","This book is chock-full of first concepts - perfect for preschoolers. There is a whole page on -ing verbs! The book I got, however, was really beat up. It was missing the first page and part of the second, and there were weird brown spots throughout the book. I would recommend the book, but would be wary of ""library discards"" in the future."
5,Richard Scarry's Best Word Book,"My adult children grew up with an ealier version of this book. I taught 1st and 2nd grades for 30 years and realize the value of literature in the home. Even though this book is not a form of literature, it is a great tool for vocabulary building. I bought this current book as a Christmas present for my new grandson, who will be 3 1/2 months old at Christmas."
5,"Loved it as a kid, love it now","I'm about to become a mom myself, and I am so ready to buy Scarry books already! I had this book as a child and I LOVED LOVED LOVED it! The pictures are so fun and imaginative, and the vocabulary is so helpful for a little kid. I remember going through my book before I could really read and making up my own little stories using the pictures- your kid will love this book forever I guarantee."
4,Not the usual view of India,"Karma Cola is definitely required reading for any westerner interested in things Indian or perhaps contemplating hitting the Dharma trail. Its recognition that misunderstanding goes both ways (eg. the anecdotes about gurus treatment of their Western students) is a good reality check for those of us whose spiritual search has taken us there. Ms Mehta gently reminds us that trying to absorb 5000 years of experience and living may take a little more than a few weeks of squat loos, and some Om Mani Padme Hums.This is the first time I've ever read a book about the move of Eastern thought into the West which was not written by a Westerner. In some ways sobering, it is also witty and at times poignant.By the way, an earlier reviewer lambasted the author for attributing the wrong language to clerks from Kerala. That mistake has been fixed in the edition I have (Minerva 1997 paperback)."
5,Better than Volume 1,"Fans of Volume 1 will definitely be pleased with Volume 2. Now that the story and characters have been set up, the writer can start having fun and it shows. The story is in full swing; there are many cliffhangers in this volume. As I mentioned in my review for Volume 1, the writer is very imaginative and gets a ton of mileage out of ordinary settings. That statement goes double for Volume 2. At the end of the book, I was thinking to myself, ""wow, this is all happening in a high school."" The Zero/Six story is many genres rolled into one: Teen, Sci-Fi, Thriller, Romance. I honestly love this series."
5,Amazing voice and guitar playing,"There's not enough words of praise to give to Ruthie on Full Circle. She has one of the strongest voices I've ever heard, and if you get the chance to see her in person you'll be doubly amazed by her guitar playing as well. Ruthie's music can't be categorized - it's a little of everything. Every song on this CD is a special treat for the ears. Her voice carries depth and emotion which leaves you either crying, laughing or both. Let me put is this way... If you were stranded on a desert island and had to choose one CD to take with you this would be the one I would recommend."
4,awesome!,"i have listened to ruthie foster for five years now, performing at local bars in college station, tx. i am SO sorry, but she NOT by any means country! she is a lot like tracy chapman, with much more r&b influence. in other words, a very soulfull folk sound, with an extraordinary voice!"
2,not recommended,"This workout was not what I was hoping for. I was looking for an intense workout with basic, tough exercises without all the outdated music and staged performances. That it is, but it is important to know that there are segments of dips, chin-ups and pull-ups that you cannot do unless you have the bars. Also, these take up lots of time because you're waiting for all the guys to do their reps, one person at a time. Unless you have the equipment, you're just standing there wondering what to do. Also, there is too much time between each set of exercises and my heart rate would fall too much. Not a steady workout at all. Would be nice to find a lot of these basic exercises in a different video. Big disappointment."
2,Briar Rose,"I did not really enjoy this book. I thought the the middle was very boring and it kind of just rambled on. However, I thougt the ending was very clever. The last 4 chapaters of the book were intersting but leading up to that the story was a little dull"
3,"It was a good book, but it needed more action.",My review on this book is that becca is a woman trying to figure ot the life that her grandmother lived during the holocaust
4,Outstanding use of fairy tale motifs,"I really do not love Holocaust books, but this one is better than most. Yolen's use of fairy-tale motifs is outstanding. Some of the present-day scenes and characterization ring a little hollow, but the final chapters made me love this story. It may start a little awkwardly, but it's worth sticking with, especially since it is pretty short. A very moving and human story."
4,"""EVERYONE HAS A STORY TO TELL""","Briar Rose is a marvelous story.It's filled with the mixture of fantasy, imagination,true love and more.When reading story of Briar Rose try to see how it relates with the story of SLEEPING BEAUTY,you will see how stranegly that they have alot in common. The way Jane Yolan wrote this book almost makes the characters seem real and alive. I would recommened this book to anyone who has an imagination and a heart for true love as well as an idea of what's really happening in the story."
4,Briar Rose,"Briar Rose is a story that intertwines the fairytale sleeping beauty and the unforgettable horrifying holocaust. The story begins with Becca Berlin and her sisters listening to her grandmother Gemma tell the fairytale sleeping beauty. As she enchants Becca with a story of castles, mist, and thorns, Becca soon realizes that there is more behind this story than Gemma actually told. Becca and her family realize this when Gemma insists that she is the princess. On Gemma's deathbed she extracts a promise from Becca that her past will be uncovered and the story will come true. Even though her sisters dismissed what Gemma said thinking she was senile, Becca was still compelled to find out exactly what her grandmother was talking about. A few pictures, newspaper clippings and entry forms, along with a man's ring are the only clues that Becca has to begin her journey. This journey will lead her to Poland were she will learn about the horrors of the holocaust."
5,Amazing Holocaust story,"I love fairy tales and modern adaptations, so when our book club chose this book I was excited. Jane Yolen does NOT disappoint. She effortlessly weaves together the basics of a fairy tale with a granddaughter's search for her identity. The symbolism and allusion are incredible. I would absolutely recommend this book to anyone who enjoys fairy tales and wants to know more about the Holocaust without being overwhelmed by it."
3,"A great solid Gangster movie, worth owning","Good solid movie starring George Raft as an ex-con trying to go straight, and not doing so well. His younger brother also frustrated with it all is considering following the footsteps of his older brother to a life of crime to get ahead. Humphrey Bogart, William Holden are great in this. Humphrey played a gangster ex-con in this as well. Good acting, strong story. I only give it 3 stars since I cant do a 3.5, and on top of that there are better classic gangster movies like Little Caesar, Kid Gallahad , Public Enemy. This does stand out on its own merits and worth checking out with some of you might wanting to own it after renting it. Even if it wasn't part of Warner's Gangster set, Id want to own it anyway because it is that good enough :)"
2,not what it said,"Sorry guys, this was advertized as 2 inches wide, maybe 1.3 at most. to thin for a 40- lb cocker. Go Dolphins though."
3,Righty,"I am a right handed person and every time I put this on I feel like it was made for a left handed person. Quality is very good, plenty of room with two pockets. Love the buckle with 3 point disconect."
2,Less than stellar conclusion to a previously stellar series...,"This book was disappointing. I've been an avid fan of the Kabuki series, but this last book is a work that seems disjointed from the other quality books. It seems more of an exercise in self-indulgence and pretentiousness than a close to a really great series. Artistically it is excellent, but the heavy handed delivery of the themes the author seeks to project hurt the story aspect.The main character turns into a mouthpiece for the author's agenda, a powerful tool when done well and most importantly, subtly; but the approach is so heavy handed here it's like being hit in the head with a sledgehammer as an agenda being crammed down the reader's through takes precedent over giving the main character and story a satisfactory conclusion.I'd recommend pretending the series ended after the Control Corps storyline, unless you really want to read one of the most self indulgent and pretentious comics ever written."
4,looks good and delivers on its promises,"this watch works well and looks like a piece of jewelry. the only downfall is that if someone is not used to it, they can start pressing the wring buttons and incorrectly change the time. i wish the time on the clock face and the spoken time would be the same but they are not.overall, we are happy with this choice. it was not too expensive and rather quietly talks the time when one pushes the appropriate button."
4,Sunny techno with a human heart... and wickedly sexy!,"First of all, I'd like to say 4-stars is a very good review for me (I used to fall into the trap of handing out 5-star reviews like candy).I first heard John Beltran on LTJ Bukem's ""Earth, volume 4,"" and thought his two tracks on the compilation, ""Aztec Girl"" and another one (I forget the title), were the highlights of this CD. So then I got some of his other stuff... I really liked these albums, but they didn't come close to his tracks on the LTJ compilation.Then along comes ""Sun Gypsy,"" which has some live instrumentation and vocals, very infectious, bossa nova-drenched beats and his trademark organic vibe.... And it's this organic approach to techno and an understanding of space that makes this album such an awesome listen.Also, this is a perfect soundtrack for knocking boots. Trust me on this one."
2,too simple,"Too basic and beginner...read it top to bottom and didn't learn a single new tidbit. If you know what the 2000 control panels and admin tools do, and can figure out how to use /? to find the arguments to a command line tool, this book will teach you nothing new. Even the RARE registry fixes are all found in the xteq setup tools. Even if a novice who didn't know how to use a control panel, the instructions seem to brief to be of much use to such a person. Not much info on troubleshooting or fixing things, just ""how to"" the basics and not much (any) info on what to do if it doesn't work or something goes wrong.Can't recommend it for beginners, and can't recommend it for beyond beginners either."
3,I don't get it...,"I had extremely high hopes for this based on reviews but it did nothing for me. I don't mind challenging reading or ""nature of memory"" stuff but this wandering from topic to topic reminded me of having a conversation with my 95-year-old great aunt, a likeable lady whose primary conversational gambit was the Endless Monologue.New characters appear without introduction and disappear so quickly that I could develop no emotional reaction to them at all. Maybe that is his point, but it seemed almost arrogant for the author to assume that everything that crosses his mind is interesting."
3,"I buy Parker for Spenser, Hawk and Susan. Sorry Robert.","All our Yesterdays was not a bad twisted intrigue, although a bit corny (I still couldn't put it down). But I am always disappointed when I pick up a Parker that doesn't include my favorite old characters! I can imagine that the writer wants to stretch out, but his fans (I couldn't even loan this one out...only Spenser my friends said!) are happiest with the characters that we fell in love with: Spenser, Hawk, Susan, and Pearl!By the way, Small Vices was brilliant."
2,I Had To Give Up On This Book And Made It Part Of All My Yesterdays!,"I usually like Parker's books,and particularly when he deviates from his Spenser books. So, I really was expecting to enjoy All Our Yesterdays, probably Parker's most significant departure from his 'norm"" However, much to my disappointment, I found this book to be have erratic pacing, slow to develop, and not very believable or interesting characters. As such, I wound up skimming through large passages and then, ultimately, giving up on it. There are just too many books and not enough time to waste time reading All Our Yesterdays."
1,stop and go,I have bought this same watch for over 10 years now. I use them until the band breaks and then buy a new one. I bought it for the first time through amazon because of free shipping and lower price. I returned it after the first day because I presume a dead battery. It would stop and go every 15 min. I went to Walmart to buy a cheap $5 watch until I got another Casio and low and behold walmart has started carrying this Casio again instore. I have not had a problem with it. I love the illumintion button because it will light up a dark room if ned be.
4,Very useful,The analog-digital interface is very useful. It's easy to tell the general time at a glance with the traditional analog interface. The digital is useful for greater details. This is particularly helpful on my bike rides. I can tell the general time with just a quick glance so I don't need to take my eyes off the road for more than a moment. I can also run the stopwatch to get a more accurate time once I finish my ride. I definitely recommend this.
5,A Pleasant Surprise,"I bought my Casio Men's Ana-Digi Illuminator Sport Watch for about $30 at Kmart with a certain amount of resignation about its durability. Experience led me to expect the internals would rot away in two years, just like every other watch they've sold me. But I needed a watch, and I liked the design more than others in the case. At the time the dual analog and digital display seemed more like an interesting novelty than anything I would use very much. Now, three years later, the watch is still ticking along, and I've become so accustomed to the display I don't want anything else. The digital clock is especially useful when I go jogging, as it allows me to easily keep track of mile splits. In terms of features, design, price, and performance, Casio got everything right with this one. It's a rare thing."
4,Great for 5200 Unbedding,"When we removed all the fittings from the deck of our fiberglass boat, these brushes were invaluable for ripping up the 5200 sealant residue left behind."
2,poor editing,"it's got great ideas for a story, but this guy is the worst author i have ever seen, and the editors are twice as bad. i haven't even read all of it to see numerous mistakes. it's ""special teams"" not ""specialty teams"" (Chad Goss story). Rick Moody put ""insulation"" in homes, not ""installation."" Alabama lost to lsu 18-12, they didn't beat them 18-12 (Jim Wells). Keep looking and you will find many more mistakes"
2,A little long and hard to read...,"This book was really too long, and it was very difficult to read. It is a little hypocritical considering the trouble the University is in now. Put there by the people that they say have so much faith, but they are dishonest. Kinda a slap in the face."
5,I love these gloves,"They are soft and comfy from day one, extremely supple but not particularly durable. I have bought at least 3 pair in the last few years to replace the worn out pair. However, in their defense, I do wear them 3x a week riding and then around the ranch doing chores. I've decided to sacrifice durability for comfort. Works for me! BTW, I also have a pair of the insulated gloves in this style. We have short winters here in the desert and they are still in great shape after several years."
1,Product not worthy to buy its internally defective,"The product was looking fine from outside, after some months of use the product was to be defective internally and slowly showed its true colors. This was a very big dissappointment for me as I have used this product with immense care but still its proven to be from a bad manufacturer. I have not got a replacement too.My sincere advise is to go for a good product even if its price is more. Do not fall in such traps. I would not recommend this product to any of us."
3,good thing it has tom arnold in it,"this movie is BORING, if it werent for tom arnold, this movie was soooo boring i cant even remember what its about, cant even remember if it had any T & A. this is a rent for a buck movie, and you still might have paid to much."
4,Truly a treat...,"Ann Coulter is as much fun to read as she is to watch on TV. She never fails to skewer her opponents in either media; it's no wonder that all the liberals can do in return is lie about her.The chapter debunking the mythical ""religious right"" is, by itself, worth the price of the book."
1,Hmmmm......Sophistry.,"This is a set of pre-fabricated thoughts for people who believe that spouting this stuff makes them look intelligent. The ironic thing is that *they* are the ones most likely to lose jobs, money, and security because of this kind of book...what *else* is the reason for such propaganda? It makes those most likely to be hurt by the positions accept (even support) the very arguments that they wouldn't consent to if they really understood what was being said."
1,A heap of trite nonesense,"Her epigrammatically styled rambling might be compared to the great American thinker/writer, Emerson, minus his genius, scope, voice, logic, style and depth. However, it seems apparent that she wrote this dribble for the marginally intelligent portion of this country (You know who you are... the quite ones in the corner, not asking the questions but relying on ""faith"" and flags). Her brand of patriotism sounds like a lot of circumscription to me, or the death-throws of the notion of white male superiority (as ordained by God and scripture), or knee-jerk, reactionary thinkers who would rather lob bombs than drop their jingoist stances."
1,Just awful,"I don't fit a potitical classification ... but this is just plain drivel. Convoluted, mean, bizarre thinking. I worry about our country after reading this."
5,On the money,"Ann's point for point dismissal of every liberal myth about conservatives is a joy to read. Attempts by libs to brush Ann off as hypocritical obviously do not get Ann's sense of humor and joy at getting under libs' skin. As great as this book has done in sales, it illustrates the point that many Americans agree with Ann and are elated that finally someone called liberals on all their pseudo-intellectual garbage.Ann is right! Those in denial of this prove that the truth hurts!"
1,"The literary equivalent of ""Plan 9 from Outer Space""","Ann Coulter is a joke as a journalist and commentator. This book is even worse than her last. I don't know why I keep reading her silly books -- I guess I keep expecting something, ANYTHING, of value, and I haven't found it in any of her books yet. She appears to be completely clueless on TV and her books make her look even worse."
1,Silly,"Just another mouth flapping ""conservative"" with nothing to back up her views. Is it just me, or did all these neo conservative 'writers' crib their style from P.J. O'Rourke? All they lack is humor."
1,Disgraceful,""" We should invade countries, kill their leaders and convert them christianity.""Ann CoulterI'm jewish and i have never seen so much hate and absolutely no tolerances for other religons.... Disgraceful!"
1,Don't Waste Your Time,"The premise of this awful book is that liberals are always wrong and conservatives are always right...blah blah blah. Ann's selective use of history, patent untruths and her own warped opinions are not factual enough to be backed up by her footnotes anyway.If this is what passes for satire in American society today, we are in trouble. Since when is hate, bigotry, and ignorance funny? I'd rather read a collection of essays from inmates at San Quentin."
1,"Ann Coulter, how about you are the liar","Please, all I must say is read Lies and the Lying Liars who are telling them, it points out so many flaws which makes this book horrible and shows the Right lies terribly."
1,Certifiable,"As a mental health worker, I can attest that people this filled with hatred frequently find themselves in mental care facilities. For those who know Ann Coulter personally, I strongy advise you to WATCH OUT! And don't leave her alone with your kids!"
1,Conservatism without a future,"Avoid this book. Ann Coulter aims to address the lowest impulse in people with a political point of view: to ridicule other points of view. It's pointless. As a conservative I like to read intelligently written books by authors who have their facts straight and show at least some level of respect for less like-minded people. In a true democracy, conservatives are only harmed by such vulgar lightweights as Ann Coulter. Keep the debate honest. Respect the other guy (Hell, I have friends who are liberals--the beer still tastes good). And avoid dummies such as Ann."
1,Summary: Blame somebody for your misery,"It only took Ann one paragraph to get to the standard ""Blame Liberals"" strategy that she and her right-wing propagandists love to teach.Such a tragic waste of paper."
5,The Stars War,"I hesitated purchasing this book until I read the very first six reviews of the book. All were one star and on the release date. That was enough proof for me to make the purchase.Now having read and enjoyed the book, I get additional pleasure in reading all the one star reviews because they prove Ann's point of the book.Get the book, read it, and see what I mean."
5,EYE OPENING BOOK,"This is a book that every person that considers themselves liberal minded needs to read. I will never vote for a liberal candidate again. I am like most average persons, just go on with my life, but this book has shown me that everyone needs to get involved again in politics. It is scary how far left this country has gone in the last 20 years.I find it dissapointing that a great many critics and readers are reviewing this through the lens of a political party and not the truth. America better open it's eyes and get involved."
5,The Liberals Can't Take it?,"Wow, 6 reviews so far, and all very negative, and most follow precisely the same ""I'm a conservative but..."" script. Do I smell a liberal conspiracy here, perhaps? From what I've seen of this book, it is (a) honest and insightful, and (b) hilarious. The hyper-tolerant liberal crowd can't possibly allow something like that, can they? Not only are they arrogant losers, they're also not very creative. Ann Coulter is the best antidote to the non-thinking, humorless totalitarianism called liberalism."
1,This Book Really Deserves NO STARS,"Ann Coulter's hateful, infalmmatory broadside is all hype and no substance (kinda like her conservative agenda). She picks alot of fights and throws alot of bombs, but never really makes any coherent arguments aside from her basic (unproven) premise that ""Liberals are Bad."" This book isn't about meaningful public discourse, it's about namecalling, hype, and self-promotion. Ann Coulter does little else here besides slander and attack her fellow Americans. For shame!"
1,projection (noun),"The attribution of one's own qualities to other people.A defense mechanism used by people who cannot tolerate their own feelings who cope by imagining that other people have those feelings.(""... but it must be true, look at all the footnotes!"" If one actually checks out the book's footnotes, what is usually found is that they are taken out of context and often outright distortions.)"
3,so slanderous,"this book is truly inviting from its title but once you jump in you're stuck in a a libral bashing trechery. ann coulter does a great job at making her point that librals are stupid individuals but what would she know, shes a republican. i did enjoy reading the book and thought it was well written but i thought she could have been more tasteful with her facts, the 'slander' seems to be comming from the conservative side onto the librals. otherwise it was a fun to read book."
1,A Slanderer writing about Slander? What a complete joke?,"For people like Ann Coulter who claim that liberals are somehow more harmful to America than even Al Quaeda, she sure knows how to make a big disgrace of herself and her attempts to write about ""Slander"" are nothing more than trying to slander people she personally hates only to backfire and contradict the very title she's against. With people like her, who needs enemies?"
1,Poorly researched and very unbalanced,"I am both a Republican and conservative, but I have no use for this woman's rantings. I may disagree with liberals, but Coulter goes too far when she accuses liberals of being anti-American, unpatriotic, and supporters of Islam (the only religion liberals like, according to Coulter). Are you going to tell me George McGovern, who risked his life as a fighter pilot in WWII, is not patriotic? And are you going to tell me all the Republican war-wimps like Newt Gingrich are? There is hypocrisy on both sides, but Coulter can't see the conservative phonies. We have our share, too, and having a thoughtless spokeswoman does not do credit to the cause."
5,A non-stop pounding of liberal absurdities.,"Ann Coulter delivers one of the most powerful and explosive exposes on the Left's conscious, methodical assault on truth. If you're a conservative, you'll be amazed and outraged at the liberal bias against anything that's even remotely conservative. If you're liberal, hang your head in shame."
1,Poorly written and researched,"Basically, Ann is a nice house, but nobody's home.She's a perfect example of how the standards of what is considered anAmerican ""intellectual"" continue to diminish.Overall, the book is poorly written and researched, and not at all insightful.Just a warmed-over helping of the usual angry rant by the privileged."
1,The American way,She is laughing all the way to the bank. That's America UNFORTUNATELY. She seems very sad though.
1,Not an interesting or a well writen book...I'm sorry.,"The right wing fans of Ms. Coulter seem to be busy bees trying to defend this barely readable book. (I bought it out of sincere interest, and continued to plow through the nonsense considering it as a comedy script). Now, you could dismiss me as 1. a ""left wing nut"" which I am not, or 2. the biased ""liberal"" ( always Ms. Coulters explanation when the truth hurts) or 3. ""never read the book"" (untrue)... but in the end, the reality stands: this book is quite boring. I read it throught to the end rather quickly, trying to understand what her point was in writing such a laughable book...but in these conservative times, ANYONE can write a book slaming so-called liberals and make money. Don't make the same mistake I did in thinking you would get a reasoned ""Pat Buchanan"" intellectual argument ( even though I tend to disagree with him). With Ms. Coulter, we are dealing with a ""lightweight"". Be forewarned...don't waste money on this one."
3,A Christian's Perspective of Ann's Book,"While Ms. Coulter is great at debating, etc., I find some of her statements and worldview just a little disconcerting. If one looks past the confidant(at times, arrogant) style in her reasoning, past the attractive and witty blonde that she is, some of her dogma reminds me (you history buffs should know) of some passionate, but scary characters of the past.While I can't go into it here, I also found some of her footnotes and sources misleading and inaccurate after checking a couple out.She's passionate, intelligent, and charasmatic and the Christian Right loves her. She could be dead wrong in her accusations, however. I didn't find her to be that Christ-like, either.Got the impression that like many extremists on both sides, there is a lot of propagandizing in order to sell copy and help get votes. This is one of those books. . ."
1,Hypothetically...,"If Ann Coulter teamed up with Laura Bush and had a 2 out of 3 falls tag-team 'rasslin match against Katie Couric and Paula Zahn for the women's rasslin tag team belts, I'm sorry to say Ann Coulter and Laura Bush would likely win : (Ann Coulter would pin Katie Couric 1-2-3 by CHEATING.Paula Zahn would pin Laura Bush 1-2-3Paula Zahn would pummel Coulter - but then would TURNon her partner, Katie Couric, while the referee wasn't lookingand Laura Bush would pin Katie Couric 1-2-3 for the win, andthe women's tag team belt!Hypothetically speaking, of course, if they was ever to 'rassle.Just my opinion, of course."
1,"This book ought to be called: Slander, My Stock in trade","...I find this title laughable, and I only had to read a few chapters to see that the book, as I expected, has no insights, few facts, only snickering put downs, distortions, and outright lies. This woman has zero compassion for anyone but herself, and does not care who gets hurt. ..."
1,"i don't need to read this book, i saw it all on crossfire","thank goodness the liberal media printed ""slander"". ann coulter can now be exposed for the blowhard she is."
1,"Thank you for playing, you're the weakest link. Goodbye!","What a snob, bigot, and a big ""B""!! This woman has nothing substantive to say. She's got some serious personal issues to deal with. Did her daddy not love her enough? Get a life!"
1,Slander is an apt title,"I have never read such absolute nonsense before in my life. Ann Coulter's new book is so incredibly poorly researched that it is painful. After being repeatedly called out on her outright lies in the book, one would think she would have the common decency to offer the public (and those slandered within the book) an apology. The chapter in Al Franken's book regarding this woman is highly entertaining, and better researched than her book. I would carry on, but ""slander"" does not deserve any more of my time."
3,Very Repetitious,The best parts of SLANDER occur when Ann Coulter sticks to the facts. I always welcome receiving intriguing information about such topics as voting patterns or PAC contributions.The rest of the book seems very repetitious as if there is no need to divide it into chapters except to allow the reader to come up for air.
5,EVERYONE SHOULD READ THIS BOOK,". . . and then go out and get Al Frankin's new book, because reading this first makes Al's even funnier. I shudder to think about what Kind of childhood trauma Coulter must have suffered that caused her to write and think this way but I hope the therapy doesn't help her for a little while yet--so that she can keep producing these steaming piles of conservative goodness. To the conservatives out there--you might want to get her some help soon because she's making you look like fools.Anyhow, if anybody is actually thinking of reading Slander (yes, I did read it, including the endnotes) I would wholeheartedly suggest it. Read Coulter first (yes it will probably repulse you), Frankin second for a good laugh, and then try some Chomsky if you are actually curious about how our media outlets work rather than just a partisan sheep."
1,Yawn,Coulter weaves tales of twisted lies and half-truths and twists those as well. It's also quite dull.
1,this book slanders reality,"An aptly titled book: This book is filled with slander. If you have ever seen this author on television shows such as Crossfire, you know that she's vicious, overemotional and has virtually no grasp of facts. The book is no different. All shouting and no substance, the usual stuff from the right wingers, who appear to have the world's greatest reserve of moral outrage, usually at government trying to solve a problem for a part of society other than corporations or rich people, or at average people enjoying life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness...So open wide, or if you're smart, avoid this book."
1,SATIRE AND NOT FACTUAL,"If this is intended to a be a serious analysis of contemporary politics, then no stars should be awarded. If it is intended as satire which seems to be its aim, then it warrants one star. By no means though is it worth wasting hard-earned money to purchase. If you want to waste money, buy a share of WorldCom or Enron but not this book."
1,Ann's message is old and tired,"Ann Coulter again reinforces that she is out of touch with the reality of daily life. In this instance, she takes on one of her favorite targets - the media. She again rails against her view that it has a bias - what a surprise. She looses sight of the irony that, she too, has a bias that is bitter and lacks positive input knowing that tearing things down sells more books than offering valid alternatives.She belongs in an old folks home where she can spread her venom without hurting anyone."
1,A SheMan Talking Junk!!!,"I have no problem with people taking another side to task, but have some class about it. The times when Ann tries to be funny in this, she falls flat on her face and look like the idiot she is. No wonder Republicans are moving away from her. Plus she makes dumb comments...she has been quoted as saying she wants to do away with the Emancipation Proclamation. Now, let me remind you that this was a REPUBLICAN agenda (Lincoln). See how dumb this woman is?!! Anybody who gives this book more than one star need to have their heads examine."
1,This book should be criminalized,"Probably one of the sickest, most perverse ""accounts"" of alleged liberal media bias. Coulter has the intellectual sophistication and moral integrity of an infant. I say this because those of you who have read Al Franken's new book, ""Lies and the Lying Liars who tell them"" know what I'm referring to. Franken manages to use real evidence to rip the credibility of ""Slander"" into shreds, showing how Coulter lied throughout most of her book."
1,This book only goes to prove...,"That any idiot can get published. If you want to read something that is devoid of any kind of intelligent, rational thought on politics and society then read this book!"
3,Poor little mayflower princess,"First thing, I didn't buy this book, I skimmed through it in the bookstore.The sad thing is, that many Americans will (silently) agree with Coulter's (ugly) viewpoint. This country was settled by religious fanatics like the Pilgrims and slave owners, so its no wonder that right wing sentiment would be still be strong in good ole US of A.The irony is that the Left --- the brave liberals throughout history who fought for civil liberties, including the rights of women -- is the only reason that Ann Coulter has the right to express her thoughts and be independent (as every human being should). If it wasn't for liberals, Ann Coulter would be home baking cookies, barefoot and pregnant and completely subservient to a conservative, abusive husband and society."
2,A Clashing Cymbol,"As a conservative, I would have appreciated just the facts without her inane packaging. I too share the belief that liberals should be sidelined. Nonetheless, I would hope that I would have more respect for the reader to make up his own mind and hold my conclusions until the climatic ending. No such luck here. This is the second time I picked up the book as Coulter is important, but having set the book down a second time makes me question her continued importance on the scene."
1,Whats that noise I'm hearing?,"Oh yeah, its Ann Coulter speaking out of her *ss! But in all seriously, how can anyone bear a minute of this? Denying evolution and pretty much every free right, whats next Ann, denying that the world is round?For those of you that actually read this garbage, mind explaining to me ONE thing good thats happened since Bush took office?And for the record, Im neither liberal nor conservative, so dont try to pull that crap on me."
1,Who's lying now?,"If you buy this book, you'd better buy ""Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them"" by Al Franken, too. With the help of his Harvard research team, he exposes this book for the steaming heap of BS that it is. Wake up, people!"
1,ZERO STARS for Ann's latest,"Its almost impossible to avoid ANNTHRAX Coulter on TV. But buying the book is optional so I'd advise you to AVOID IT AT ALL COST!!!!As anyone who has been subjected to Ann's daily appearances on TV (or her ""column"" on-line and in some of the nation's poorer newspapers) knows, this woman is insane. Her ""political"" rhetoric appears to be the pundit's version of turret's syndrome, she will say the most horrible and personal things about people, then attack them for quoting her and call it ""slander"".There, you just got the idea of the book. For Coulter, its all about ME ME ME. She is a lunatic. Don't read this book."
1,This woman is an...,"This book is repetitive, biased, poorly reasoned, and pointless. If you need a bunch of extremist ranting to make your life seem better somehow, consider instead counseling.After reading this, many intelligent people will be twice as liberal as they were before."
5,Strait shooter with humor,"Easy to read, documentation is outstanding, humor bites and the dialogue is brutally honest. Recommend a Strong Buy."
1,"Lies and fantasies make for great entertainment, but...","There are so many factual errors and distortions in this book, all to entertain the neoconservative audience. One can only assume that the author lives in a fantasy world in which anyone who does not think like she does is by definition evil and thus deserving of the worst kind of verbal abuse. There's a psychological term for this kind of pathological black/white thinking, wish I could remember what it is. But it is definitely a pathology (that means mental illness for those who don't like multi-syllable words). This sort of weak-minded, immature entertainment is only a symptom of why neoconservative American politics cannot be take seriously. A shameful, pathetic replacement for what was once the honorable tradition of conservative American politics."
1,Made of Pressboard junk,Basically the box is painted press board to look like wood. The handles on the side are cheap tin. It looks like something from a 5 and 10 store. The only real thing is the brass plate on top. I'm embarrassed to give it as a gift and ended up giving it to my kids to play with. What a disappointment. It must be a mistake in shipment. The box is not worth more than $12.
5,I'm crazy about this book!!!!,I'm crazy about this book. It's filled with common sense and uncoomon wisdom.
3,Disappointed customer,"I recently bought these pans and I am very disappointed in them. The main problem is that the handle on each pan in the set gets extremely hot and you will have to use a hot pad when picking it up or cooking with it. Had I known this, I never would of bought them."
1,didnt fit right,peice of crap. i bought this for my 96 accord and it wouldnt fit in the accord trim. i had to sand down all sides to make it go in. i wouldnt buy this again.
2,Pictures Lie,Even though the picture shows two earrings you only get one earring when you order so you have to order twice to get a complete pair. Also the barbed wire closure had to be pried off to put the earring on and now noone can put it back on.
4,British view of marine electronics,Read this book over holidays. Found good basics plus some real nuggets in the chartplotter and radar navigation sections. Interesting view with many unusual brands as well as the global standbys.
1,happy fairy land,"Welcome to happy fairy land where every problem can be solved by a friendly talk. Then close the book and walk back out to the real world, where anyone who is different is depised and most people just won't listen to each other. It would help more to eat this book than to read it - at least it would add fiber to your diet."
5,Totally different,"an amazing cd.. still deserves 5 stars.. not as good as losing streak.. but anyways..every track on this cd sounds totally different , and each tarck is equally addicting. the best tracks are plastic cup politics.. ghosts of you and me.. science of selling yourself short.. and short fuse burning. Less Than Jake is the best band out there and i hope they dont change into pop like new found glory did. LTJ is amazing"
4,what lack of ska?,"i dont know how some people can say that there is less ska in this cd to previous less than jake cds. ltj have always been, out of all the ska bands out there the one with the least ska. and this 'lack of ska' does not change how good this cd is, having only listened to it a couple of times, there are some songs that immediately get stuck into your head, the science of selling yourself short, and motown never sounded so good, and if a song can get stuck in your head on your first listen, it must be something good.the new version of look what happened is also good.throw in an extra star for the great cover work and all the pictures.also, short fuse burning has a real acdc feel to the riff."
2,Johny Quest has a point,"I remember buying Hello Rockview (my first, followed by buying others), putting it into my CD player, and just feeling the music inside me. It was amazing. I liked Borders and Boundaries less, though it began to grow on me, and Losing Streak and Pezcore were somewhere in between. This CD is in my eyes an outrage and sullies the good name of the band. There are a few decent songs, though many more songs which make me wonder what happened. If one looks at all the reviews, they notice a trend which puts older LTJ fans tending to dislike Anthem, while newer fans (riding the pop-punk wave? Perhaps) seem to like it a great deal. For older LTJ fans like me, you'll be much happier listening to your old CD's and staying away from this one; not knowing what happened to a very good band."
2,Ska?,"So yeah, I know ska is pretty much dead, but did LTJ really have to cross over? This record is pure pop-punk, with a horn thrown in (almost never) here and there. Fans of older LTJ and ska should look elsewhere. Pop-punk blows!"
5,This is Less Than Jake we're talking about,"If your truely in love with a band, you must appreciate all of there music. Though Anthem may not be the same as losing streak, or maybe it doesnt have quite as much ska, it is surely a great cd. One way to describe it is "" borders and boundaries gone right"". You cant expect the same music over and over again, and thats what makes me love less than jake because they can change, and they can pull it off. Buy this cd. Also the re-done look what happened is very good. The science of selling yourself short is a new ska feel for ltj, but songs like the ghosts of me and you is a new punk feel for them also."
1,Never seen such a blatant sell-out,"I liked the ""Losing Streak"" album, it really wasn't so bad. Less Than Jake have always been a somewhat mediocre band in my opinion, however they have always maintained their integrity... until now. This album is the friggin pits, man. You're better off buying Shania Twain if you want to listen to corporate pop music, and that's an indisputable fact. This band has no business doing what Shania Twain does, it's an ugly embarassment.I don't know if you saw their ""music video"" which was heavily promoted during ""The OC,"" the new 90210-esque show for teens. It was truly sad, I could barely tell it was the same band. They looked like friggin clowns. I don't know about you, but if I were in a punk band, I would rather die than be shamelessly promoted like a can of friggin soda or a bag of friggin chips. Eat me."
3,Different time Different sound,"This cd is alright i have been waiting for a new release from less than jake, but this cd seems to be different then the older stuff, but hey its 2003 guess its time for a change."
5,Lightweight and simple to use,"Assembly can be a little difficult and tricky. You have to gently insert a bolt through the handle which already has an electric wire running through it. It is very important to unpack the snowblower very carefully and to use care in assembling because you could cause hidden damage to the wire inside the handle. Once you get it assembled, and you buy a 14-guage extension cord that is long enough to reach from your electric outlet to the farthest reaches of your driveway, it's a piece of cake."
5,A back saver!,"My snow blower arrived just before a huge snowstorm hit northern Virginia. Although a few parts had to be attached, it was very easy to assemble. I didn't wait for the end of the storm to try it out, and it handled 6-8 inches well each time. In fact it made the formerly backbreaking job of clearing the driveway almost fun."
1,BROKE DOWN ON ME,"SO I LIVE IN BOSTON AND WE GOT SNOW!!! I ONLY USE THIS MACHINE FOR 3 TIMES AND IT JUST START TO SMELL LIKE SOMETHING IS BURNING, I GOT REALLY SCARED CAUSE IT IS ELECTRIC...I DIDN'T WANT TO GET SHOCK. SO I STOP AND WAIT A WHILE TO START IT AGAIN, THIS TIME IT WON'T THROW THE SNOW LIKE IT DID BEFORE IT JUST DROPED ITS POWER BY HALF...THAT WASN'T FUN.THE OTHER THING IS THAT THE CORD ALWAY GET IT THE WAY YOU COULD NEVER MOVE FREELY, IT'S REALLY HARD TO MOVE AROUND WITH THIS MACHINE. JUST NOT PLEASANT EXPRERIENCE.."
1,not quite satisfied,"Product arrives and had to be assembled.....not easily done.Used it on a 2"" accumulation and it worked fine. Next time it was 4"" and did not throw!I was referred to, and delivered it to a local supplier who repaired it under warranty. It worked fine next time for an 8"" depth of snow.Should not have had the problem. AND should have purchased it locally for $1. less than using the internet."
5,BEST MONEY I EVER SPENT!,I just received my Toro Snowthrower [+ 100' yellow cord]from Amazon and today we had 8 inches of snow. I am not mechanically inclined but even a total idiot could use this snowthrower! I finished all my snow removal in 1 hour - compared to an 8 hours of hand shoveling. The extension cord did come unplugged a few times until my [much smarter] neighbor suggested I wrap the cord around the handle a couple of times. Problem solved. My neighbor always helps me shovel and today I was able to repay the favor by snowthrowing his entire driveway. My only regret is that I didn't buy this baby sooner!
1,do not buy this!!!,I used this blower 2 times before the belt burned up. Took it in to have it fixed and it last 1 more time. Maybe the snow here in Califorina was too wet but do not spend any money on this!! I read all the great write up's that people sent in and can only thank some one in Toro wrote them.
1,This machine is junk!!,I bought this brand new from a Toro Master Service dealer in Vermont. The second time I used it the drive belt and pulley broke. This was while working on only 3 inches of moderately heavy snow. Took it into the dealer where it now sits as he had to order the parts. DON'T BUY ONE!! You will end up wishing you had popped for a little more money and bought a decent gas-powered unit.
2,broken after two year,"Just broken after two years with bills broken, twenty times use in two years run, but you can fix it just need find right bills to replace it, but i still not can find it yet,"
1,Don't buy a Toro!!,"Bought a new TORO snow Power Clear blower at the end of last winter, and I used it twice. I got it ready for this winter to find it leaking gas and in need of an entire new carburetor!!! I used it TWICE!!!! Seems there was a recall, but since Toro sent me no notice during the summer, when I could have gotten it fixed, it now sits in the shop, awaiting a back-ordered part, with winter on my door step. Thanks TORO, for a $500 paper weight. Never again with a TORO!"
5,Great Buy!,The snow blower is great! We had over 2 ft of snow. We used the blower when the snow was between 6 and 11 inches and it was so much easier than shoveling. We are pleased with how far it blew the snow. With an electric blower you have to keep the cord out of the way but you don't have to mess with oil and servicing. I would buy it again without hesitation. We usually do not get 2 ft of snow but it will be great no matter how much snow comes.
4,After a 5 inch snow.,"Soon after I received the Toro Snow Thrower we received 5 inches of snow. It did a wonderful job with only problem being a belt that slipped off. After I figured out how to put the belt back on, I have not further problems. I am very pleased with the purchase."
1,owner manual charge,I inherited a TORO snowblower this year and tried to find an owner manual online. i was absolutely appalled that i had to order it on line and was charged over $7 for an owner manual that was only 20 pages long.i have to wonder why a company would want to make money off of me for 20 sheets of paper after you have already bought their product.why cant they allow you to download for free????
4,We Like It!,"We had an ancient Toro snow blower that finally gave up the ghost after 20+ faithful years of service. Since we had such good luck with our other Toro, we decided to buy a Toro product again. We like this snow blower! It's a lot lighter than our old one, but it seems to do a great job getting the snow up off the driveway and sidewalks. The only hassle is, if you are used to a gas-powered machine, managing the electric power cord on this machine will take some getting used to.We found the snow blower at Amazon to be cheaper than any of the places it is available locally (CO), and we received it in two days."
2,Hope you dont need parts,"Product worked great for a couple of days, then the main drive belt snapped (i was blowing 3-4 inch snow) So called there customer service and was told to take it to the closest dealer so they could check if it was manufacture defect or user error. I really didnt want to haul the thing down there so i called to just order a belt ($12) which i would fit myself. Basically the belts are were on back order and have been for some time. 3 Week lead team for a Belt, Really this should be a common part thats likely to need to be replaced at some point. Wanted to give this a good review as the unit worked very well at first but let down by terrible customer service."
4,Beats shoveling,"Absolutely does the its thing most of the time in typical metro NYC winters. Does a nice job provided there is less than six inches on the ground. Anything more and you have to play with it, like by tippng back the handle to seesaw the unit up. If you live in a particularly snowy region consider a larger machine.The Toro is reasonably priced but I would highly recommend a least a 50 foot heavy duty extension cord. I actually could probably use a 100 footer."
4,The Little Snow Thrower that could ...,"Electric, and light weight. It did the job on ~14"" of snow. I did take one star away due to the electric cord, but I preferred electric over gas due to the maintenance overhead of gas, and how many times I actually use it over the year. It did sit in my garage for about 4 years before I broke it out.It does take about 15-20 minutes to assemble. I expected it to be a little simpler, but not bad."
5,Superb Snow Thrower!,I purchased this Toro Snow Thrower at the beginning of this winter season via Amazon.com. Today was the first time I've really had a chance to try it out. The Washington DC area got around a foot of snow. This Snow Thrower handled it without any hesitation. I cleared my driveway and several neighbors driveways in about HALF the time it used to take me to shovel mine alone. It was even able to chomp up the mound of snow at the bottom of the driveway left by the snow plow. Excellent item.. nothing diappointing about it. Probably the best 200+ bucks I've ever spent! I'm sold!
2,Buy it but get it from a dealer,"This was shipped by Amazon ""collapsed"" and it was impossible to fit the handle together. When I called Toro they said that they never ship these direct to customers since a special tool may be required even to fit the handle together.There is a reason these are sold assembled...I'll write back when mine is working!"
5,does the job,Ordered it on Wednesday with free standard shipping and received it on Thursday. Assembled it in less than 15 min. with no problems. Used it on 8 inches of dry snow to clear a 40'X 15' driveway in less than 25 min. Threw the snow a good 20'. Much better machine than I expected.
3,I got what I paid for,"I have had this snow blower for about 6 years. It finally gave out last year and I had to have the rotors repaired. It lasted one more season and now I have given up and am going to have to replace it. I was satisfied with its performance overall, except for slushy snow conditions when it would clog up. So, performance under ideal conditions, excellent! Reliability, very good. Longevity, I got my money's worth, but will be trying a different more powerful electric blower this time around and crossing my fingers hoping that the next one is better (or at least as good) than the Toro."
1,burned itself after 1.5 years of light use,"Actually, it only worked in one winter. Bought in 2007/02, used only a few times in 2008, and in 2009, it burned itself in the first snow. I wish I could spend the money wisely, I could just use the money to have someone clean the driveway for me. Will never buy Toro again, my Tora lawn machine is another piece of junk I shouldn't buy."
1,Mine lacked power,"Perhaps it has been improved, but an older one I had that has similar specs was generally useless in Cleveland winters. I literally threw it out with the trash after a few years. I couldn't even bring myself to sell it to someone as I felt I'd be misleading them that it did much of anything. A high quality snow shovel is faster and better. Completely bogged down with anything more than a 2 to 3 inches of light fluffy snow. Heck, a snow good shovel clears that in no time w/ no cord to tangle, run over, or accidently pull out of the socket. I'd suggest getting a ""real"" machine or a good shovel. This is an in between solution that I wasn't satisfied with personally."
1,Drive belt won't stay on.,"I don't know if I got a defective one or what, but I used it once in 12 inches of snow and it worked great. Good throw distance and whatnot. My one complaint is that since it is so light it tends to slide sideways pretty easily.The second storm, about 6 inches today, the blade stopped spinning and there was a whirring sound. I took off the side plate (which was bent and not installed properly) and it turns out the drive belt came off. So, I put the drive belt back on, but it will not stay in place anymore. The thrower goes about 5 feet and that's it.I am really confused about why this snow thrower got so many good reviews but mine stunk. Judging by the incorrectly installed side plate and all, I think I may just have gotten a dud. Anyway, I am now soured on this model and will buy a gas thrower.Incidentally, if you do decide to buy this item, Home Depot has a Rigid 100-foot 15 Amp sub zero temp extension cord for $65. It is a pretty good deal."
5,It really works!,"I live in Northern Virginia, and we don't get a lot of snow...until this year! After the Presidents Day storm I decided to get a snow blower. I was going to get a big gasoline model, but after reading the reviews here I decided to try the Toro. It shipped the same day I ordered it from Amazon, and although the estimate was 5-9 days for shipping, it arrived by UPS in 4 days, just in time for another 5-6 inches. Read all the other reviews, they are all true. The Toro 1800 works great. The only hassle in the cord, but you get use to that. The light weight, not having to worry about gas, maintanence, easy to store, etc. all make up for it being a corded snowblower. I just did my walk and driveway, as well as 5 of my neighbors. Just on the good will I now have, it has paid for itself. Thanks Amazon, Toro and UPS!"
5,Lidco L1090 Electric Patio Party Lights 7 Temple Lights,"I had been shopping for a string of patio lights in preparations for my annual luau. The temple lights provided just the right touch of festive atmosphere when hung from the canopy over the buffet in the yard. I was a little bit concerned about the quality when I first began to assemble the lights because I had trouble fitting the rings and tops to the bulb covers, but once completely assembled, the lights looked and performed marvelously. Each lantern was a bit larger than I had anticipated, and they made a colorful visual impact within the decoating scheme for the luau. I am very pleased with my purchase and recommend them to others."
5,Scooby-Doo! Music of the Vampire,"Scooby-Doo funny and fun; wanted it in DVD to be able to take on travels with a portable DVD player, so glad found it at a price I could afford to change from VHS to DVD and it arrived quickly."
2,What happened?,"We have every Scooby Doo there is. The old ones, the new ones, Mystery Inc, all of them. Some are better than others. We loved Phantosaur but this one, wow, man is it bad. The ""story"" is hit and miss between bizarre musical numbers. And calling them musical numbers is being very generous. I suppose everyone is entitled to a bomb now and again. My suggestion is to watch it on Cartoon network before you buy it."
2,Tedco Gyroscopes,"Fun and educational for the kids, but the quality is not what it was many years ago, and the two that I got were not well balanced and virbate too much."
2,Are they supposed to be broke when you get them?,"When I got them they were very dirty looking, not really shinny like in the picture, also something you can't really see in the picture is the outer ring on both have a break in it and I do now know if they are supposed to be there, but my first thought was that they were broken. Then the string they give you to spin them isn't the best, one string was already splitting apart when I pulled it from the box and after a few uses it is clear it will break soon. They vibrate a lot and are not very steady. I guess the worst part is no matter how hard I pull they only stay balances for about 5 seconds before they start to fall and you can' do any of the cool stuff you might think. Maybe I just expected to much but it feels like a product you would buy from a dollar store."
2,Fun 'til they broke,"It is very difficult to find a durable gyroscope that's not overly expensive. I purchased the two pack so that we could do some of the double gyroscope tricks, but one became so out of balance that it was barely usable. The other kept separating where the ring joint meets each time we pulled the string. I would have paid double if this item was more durable and better made."
3,Fun when they work,"Gyroscopes, in general, are a fun toy that showcases a really neat scientific principle. These gyroscopes, however, just don't spin very well, especially with the included string. When they do spin fast enough to demonstrate gyroscopic effects, they don't maintain the momentum very well, so it's over before you can balance them on the stand, your finger, etc."
1,Racism and the Gospel do not mix,"This book, which sees perversion around every corner, is itself a perversion of the Gospel of Christ. I was shocked with the racist views expressed in its pages. It is neither a biblical nor a scholarly interpretation of American History."
2,One Small Slice of a Large Pie,"Please remember that this is a Frontline episode, not a work from A&E;, the History Channel, or most of PBS. Thus, it ran like a news show, rather than a proper documentary.This work shows meth addicts at the beginning briefly, then it goes into how the DEA is trying to prevent its production and how drug traffickers find loopholes in the strategy. If you want to hear more, you won't.Oprah's episode on meth was much different than this. Fred Durst sang, ""Keep rollin', rollin', rollin'!"" and Lady Miss Kier of Deee-Lite sang, ""Keep the host spinnin'! Keep the host spinnin'!"" Gay activists have been trying to curb meth abuse in the gay community. However, none of this comes up for Nightline. Nightline just gives you one perspective on this multi-faceted concern."
2,When you finally get it,"1. Ordered 6-5-052. Second delivery w/ all parts 7-13-053. Product: Powermatic 64A w/ 50"" accufence.4. Saw: assembled in several hours w/ little aggravation.5. Accufence: Nothing fit w/out drilling, tapping, and/or grinding. I purchase harbor freight & grizzly cheap chinese out of necessity and have never had this much trouble.6. For the money find another product.7. This review is one of two(the first missing delivery: I am writing about the assembly, not the function. When I finally get this thing together, I'll write further in the second delivery.)"
3,Missing/Damaged parts and extreme vibration,"The cast iron extension wings were both warped (concave). The fence came without the hardware to attach it to the long wooden table. The fence came without the glider for the back rail, and the clear ""cursor"" through which you read the scale was busted.When the saw is running there is a great deal of vibration in the motor and when it winds down the motor shakes badly.I just requested replacement parts so we'll see how that goes."
3,"Good storytelling, but poor editing","I got hooked pretty quickly by this story, being drawn in by the meeting of Rich and Alex. Being a hopeless romantic, I enjoyed seeing their developing relationship play out. The other characters were also well-written, and Michele did a good job of humanizing them and making them easy to relate to. The editing, however, left much to be desired. One particular place in this story, the wrong character's name was used, which pulled me right out of the story, making me think, ""Wait. When did so-and-so get into this scene?"" Then there were tons of punctuation oversights and errors, making it hard to stay focused on the story when they kept yanking me out. I would've like to have seen this story go through a more thorough editing process, since the sloppiness there really spoiled an otherwise good story."
3,Troubled Series is Listing,"Remo and Chiun tackle a contemporary problem - piracy on the high seas. Rather than use the nefarious South Seas pirates as models, the current ghost author has a crew of malcontents sailing the Caribbean, wreaking havoc, kidnapping, killing, all under the guise of 18th century pirates. Unfortunately, although these pirates are quite successful, when the author trots out the individual characters they ooze incompetence, and so their exploits seem all the more unbelievable. Of course, Remo and Chiun are sent in to the rescue, but some very clever high points in the story are coupled with some parts that drag. Couple that with some very uncharacteristic-like behavior on Remo and Chiun's part (e.g., Chiun allows himself to be repeatedly insulted, behaves subserviently, and expresses faith in Remo coming to the rescue), we have the latest in a mediocre string of Destroyers as this ghost author attempts to craft clever stories while staying true to the Destroyer heritage."
4,"A trip into the head of a nine year-old, by fermed","There is not word in English to describe the opposite of a crime, but if there were, it would surely define this novel. It is quite frankly a pro-life, pro-honesty, pro-love, pro-decency, and a pro-preadolescent female (or male) book.One is rarely taken by an author inside the head of another human being in as gentle, thorough, and exquisite a way as it happens here. Nory is very real -- too real to contribute much excitement to the action of the book (the book has very little action, therefore). The excitement comes from our being able to permeate this incompletely formed mind, to perceive the world through her immature cognitive mechanisms, and to peer upon a world we recognize but which is fundamentally different from our own. It is a magical trasposition that Baker performs between us and Nory. One should turn to this book when life is especially mean, or humdrum."
3,Kept waiting for plot.,"Although this author did a great job of writing from the young girls perspective, a plot would have made the book much more fun. Still, the book was time well spent and many of the random thoughts going through Nory's head were amusing. I look forward to reading some more of his work."
2,"The story was very disjointed, and tried to be too cutesy.","This is the first book I have read by this author, and will be the last, too. This is basically a children's book. Also, I did not need the misspelled words, to make me believe a child was writing these stories. I feel like I wasted my time on this one; I'm glad it wasn't any longer! Anyone disagree or agree?"
2,not up to his usual standards..,I've liked the other Baker books I've read (so far The Fermat and Vox). This one just bored me. His continued use of the word choice and spelling of a young girl annoyed me. I had to force myself to finish it.
2,Product title deceiving,"Based on the title of this product, I thought I was getting all three sections of this book (D, E, and F). Instead I only received section F, with no explanation about that in the product description, as far as I could tell. The book did arrive in a timely manner, however."
2,Book's Format Needs Work,"The APA manual, standard for undergraduate- and graduate-level writing, needs to be rewritten.Its poor formatting and jumbled outline leave amateur college students baffled and looking to abbreviated sample papers for help. The professors are the only ones who have had time to master this tome of confusion.As another reviewer opined, it is ""boring, but necessary."""
1,Poorly Organized,"I've got nothing against APA format, but you'd think that a bunch of psychologists of all people might be able to write a manual with some sense of logic to it. I've mostly been using this book as a reference to picky little formatting points, but the organization is so bizarre that finding the info I need has been the most frustrating part of writing my thesis. Just because the APA has a monopoly on this format doesn't give them an excuse to provide such a terrible reference on it. If you've got any other option in learning APA style, take it instead of this book."
3,"If you have to own it, get the spiral bound copy.","If you're in a discipline and/or graduate program where APA is required, and the APA Manual is a must, I recommend finding & purchasing the spiral bound version of the Manual. It's a bit more expensive, but worth it. It's nice not having the text close just when I finally find how to cite a particular reference."
3,Another Headache!,"This is only useful for people who have to write APA papers and manuals for school or publication. The changes from the 4th edition are minor, except for the refferences section. It seems that this edition was just released in order to get more money, because the 5th edition is virtually the same as the 3rd edition."
5,Ya Gotta Have It,"If you plan on doing any research in the social sciences in any way shape or form whatsoever, you must have this book."
1,Ask Some Questions,If you are buying this book for you a college course you may want to wait. Find out if you will be reading the content of the book or simply referring to it for use with papers. It is not particularly well laid out or easy to understand. You may find other publications about APA style are easier to read and reference. It lacks enough clear practical examples and no tables for quick references. Often if you are searching for a specific way to document or reference something you are working on it is difficult to locate in the book. It should be rewritten with the occasional user in mind.
1,"Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association, 5th ed",The only reason to buy this book is b/c you have to have it as in it is required for the class. It is awful! You can't find anything in it. If you are lucky enugh to find something label with a sticky label so you can find it again. When you do find what you are looking for it doesn't explain the subjust well enough to use the information. Look up heading and how to use them and see if you can determine which heading to use when. This book is junk and a waste of good money. Look it up on line and save your moneyy.
3,"Useful reference, but could be better","There are plenty of criticisms of the APA format in the numerous reviews below. Unfortunately, it is a style that those of us in the psychology field must adhere to.This book is useful as a reference and contains a lot of information that you need to know. However, it is poorly organized and not always easy to find what you need easily in the index.Also, this book is weak in terms of how to cite Internet sources. This is a major shortcoming in my opinion. I also think the whole book can be more clear in its presentation.There are many Internet resources on APA style. Many schools post these and perhaps some of you will find that you can get by with these."
4,Does the job...,"If you need to know APA style, this book covers all the bases and is pretty user-friendly. Although I have seen this book with a spiral binding that might be easier to use, being able to leave one page open to refer to."
4,Who Is This Book Written For?,"My cousin Harvey is enrolled in a program of advanced study and APA is the the perfect style of citation for his research due to the indexing and referencing used throughout the book. After he finished writing his reports, the only thing he wished was different in the book was that there were more colorful pictures which would make it more more fun to read. The manual seemed to be written for experts and his only complaint is that he would prefer a Sixth Edition written for dummies!Otherwise, he thought the manual was extremely readable and the table of contents and index were both very helpful in navigating through the book, although he had to spend several hours doing it. He highly recommends the spiral bound version because it stays open without using a heavy weight."
3,Decent manual,"This manual covers most of what you need to know. I found it difficult to search for obscure citation references (other than book, web page, journal article etc...). Standard reference material no more, no less."
3,=),"Helps with APA format, but sometimes easier to just search online because this book can sometimes be confusing. How many pages can one read on APA format?! But brand new, perfect condition."
1,Review,"I never received this book, although I paid for it. This seller should be disallowed future opportunitites to utilize Amazon."
2,Online,I think most of the information can be found free online with a google search. I already spent $200 on course books and could have avoided this expense.
3,A.P.A . Publication Manual (5th Edition) Review,"Not suggested for college students writing assignments for classes unless absolutely needed. I found this book to be confusing as there are no examples given for the possible formats to use in my case. Were I writing a thesis or a research paper, this book would be perfect."
3,A must have for Psychiatrists or Psychologists Professionals or Students!,"If you want to know the correct way to publish a book, thesis or written work in the APA form, you should get this book! I wish it had been structured in a different way though, or explained things more clearly, but either way it is a must have!"
4,Most complete guide to APA style,"Let's face it -- The Publication Manual of the APA isn't going to make Oprah's Book Club anytime soon. I'm not going to offer a review of which publication style is better (MLA, Chicago, or APA). That's irrelevant. The question one should ask is: Does this book provide an adequate guide to publishing in APA style?Yes, it does.This is a textbook, not a novel. As one reviewer sourly pointed out, it isn't compelling. It's not meant to be The Ultimate Guide to Harry Potter Fan Fiction. It's a concise guide to APA style.If you are looking for no-nonsense complete information on APA style, this is the best and most authoritative guide on the market.If you're looking to be entertained instead of educated, then buy yourself a copy of Eats, Shoots and Leaves."
2,"Confusing, and hard to use","I bought this book because most of the internet guides are not comprehensive enough to cover specifics addressed in this book. I agree with other users that say this book lists material on the same topic in multiple places, requiring you to waste time checking around for something you think you remember seeing before. The index needs to be re-done, something I hope they fix for the next edition. Electronic resources are very generally addressed."
1,pain to read,"i think the apa would be hard pressed to create a book that is less readable or straight forward, and as i sit here trying to write my paper in apa format i hope that somewhere out there someone is sparing themself purchasing this book because quite frankly it is horrible"
5,SHINING THROUGH will always be on my keeper shelf.,"Reviewer: Renee S. N.Y.C.I read this book twenty years ago, when it was originally published, and promptly went out and bought my own copy. I have reread it every year since then, or whenever I needed a morale boost. It is not an exaggeration to say that I love SHINING THROUGH. It will always be on my keeper shelf. The story is a deeply satisfying one about a girl who starts out by making all the wrong choices in spite of what she really knows is the truth. Just read her description of John Berringer's character in the first chapter and you'll see what I mean. Somehow, despite herself, she ends up where she should be, doing what she should do. You can't ask for anything more in a novel. Kindle says the book is ""not currently available"" but find it, or make them put it back on the K. Only DO NOT see the movie instead. It is an abomination!!"
1,Poor product,"I bought this printer looking for a good price, but just one year later the printer was not working because of the mechanism to take the paper from the tray was broken, when I contact Dell they recomend me buy another one, because the guaranty have expired. I think this is a very fragile product."
3,ok printer for the money,"This is a pretty noisy printer- I don't recommend having sit next to you.There is a several second delay after one hits ""print"". I wouldn't care, but an irritating pop-up from Dell comes up and blocks further typing until it dissapears. The main function of the popup seems to be to encourage ordering supplies from Dell."
4,stop the popup when printing,"You can stop the irritating pop-up and the several seconds delay by going to Dell's uninstall and chossing only the this item, i cant rememeber what its called but you should be able to recognize it"
1,Trash,This TV is really a piece of S--t!! I am so glad I purchased the extended warranty. The company is now out of business and no parts are available. This TV just keeps falling apart.
2,Not as fancy as it looks,"Looks cool, but the leather is coming unglued on the handles of the knife already. Serves it's purpose which is to help mix up drinks."
1,Dog would not use,"We tried this with our new puppy and gave it a good month of effort. We even discussed it with our dog trainer thinking we were doing something wrong. We could not get the puppy to use these, which is a shame since it would have been so nice when we travel. We wasted money and training time on this one, our dog would not use it.If you try it I hope you have better luck than we did,"
2,"better than rest, still not up to the mark","I read this book and one other book before giving and failing in the exam. It was much better than Syngress Media book which just covered MSF. But still don't expect this book alone to get you throuh Exam 70-100.Basically, Eaxm 70-100 is a test of Intellegence, concentration, stamina and Analytical Aptitude. Nothing more, nothing less."
2,This is more of textbook that a test prep!!,"Granted, the material is already dry and tough work through, this book makes it even tougher! I bought this book, tried unsuccessfully to work my way through it, then looked at competing books. The Syngress book is far superior, and keeps you focused on the Microsoft requirements. Ben Ezell clearly understands the material, but his book drones on like a boring professor. I have been an MCSD since Feb '96, with 8 MS certifications and am looking to fulfill the new MCSD requirements. This book just didn't do it for me."
5,Great Boots!,"Very cute, warm, and classy boots. They look even better when wearing and can match well with pants and skirts."
2,Suspicious Copy,"This copy of Feuerbach's The Essence of Christianity is extremely suspicious. Not only is there no publisher information, but the text is also replete with orthographic errors. For instance, rather than ""I,"" one finds ""1""; many words that should be capitalized are not; and there are many punctuation errors. It really is incredible, and makes me very suspicious of this copy and its legality (could it be an illegal copy?).In any case, if such things as described above don't bother you, it's great for the price. But those things do bother, I'd go elsewhere for my copy."
1,DVD didn't work!,"Bought for my nephew for 2009 Christmas. Seller said DVD wasn't new but good condition. Box arrived after Christmas, beat up and worse of all ... it didn't work! Trying to work with seller to replace item but really really disappointed."
3,OK watch,"As a basic watch this is ok. It is disapointing that I can' use the day or date functions as they randomly change when I move around, as the buttons aren't protected."
5,Very pleased,"I tried a Sony Mavika first and it seemed awfully cumbersome to have to page around and also to set one of six picture qualities whereas the Fujifilm 2600 was easy, especially right out of the box. The one setting fits most was very comforting when shooting different scenes.Also interesting to learn so much about the digital cameras from the Staples store personel. They are very knowledgeable and friendly. Their 110% price matching guarantee also is attractive when shopping for items in this price range."
2,Didn't like it,"Camera takes very nice pictures and they print out very nice, but the program is way to confusing, returning camera today."
2,"Great features, low reliability","I loved this camera until it broke on the second day of my vacation in Japan (one month after the warranty expired of course). The part that broke was the motor that moved the lens, so I couldn't focus or zoom. I sent it back to Fuji to fix and they want to charge me [a lot] to evaluate the repair and over [even more] to fix it! Obviously it's cheaper to just buy a new camera."
3,Wonderful for 3 years and then quit working,"I have enjoyed this camera for about three years now. The picture quality is good and it is easy to use. BUT, just a few days ago while taking Christmas pictures it just died! The lens is stuck in an open position and the power will not come on. I have since learned that this camera is famous for working a year or so, and then the motor quits working. I would recommend a more reliable digital camera."
2,Weak Software,"This camera is a kick. For the price ...you get a great package. Rechargable batteries, 16mb Smart Card. These two items alone save you money. After buying any ditital camera, one must go out and buy a bigger card and boxes of batteries. With this camera, my only purchase will be for a 128mb Smart Card. ... The only reason I don't give this camera a higher rating is because of the software. I think it is weak. The other great thing though is Fuji's 800 tech support. This is my second dititial camera this year. This one will last me 2 maybe 3 years before I have to upgrade again."
4,Great Camer,"This is my first digital camera and I am quite pleased with the results thus far. The camera is very easy to use and takes great pictures. The only complaint that I have about the camera is the lens cover. The cover needs to be fully ""clicked"" open in order to take a picture and it is very easily ""unclicked"". This requires you to slide the cover open again...a little annoying but tolerable."
3,It's okay.,My daughters enjoyed this toy but only for a short while. They still take it out once in a while.
2,this toy is okay,This product was fun for about 30 minutes then my chanld losst interest due to the fact that the toy did not leave much to the imagination. The colors were dull and you can not draw very well to enhance the detail.It is not messy though.
2,Save your money,"A fair read. Author talks too much about his military days, and I am sure there are better driving books out there. There is more basic security concerns directed towards females written in this book then actual driving techniques. Save your money and buy a different driving book, unless you are giving this to your mom or wife who problay wouldn't like to read this anyway. There was like 1 or 2 interesting chapters realted to driving in here, not enough in my opinion to warrant buying the whole book."
1,Review of La Casa Embrujada,We had to read this book for our spanish class in high school. I thought it was horrible. The plot seemed like it was written by a 6 year old and the ending was very very predictable. If your a 6 year old then this is the book for you but otherwise dont force your high school students to read this book.
1,This is not worth the $ 5,"This isn't worth more than $5...but it's a OK book, even though it is like 50 pages."
3,How to,"This book is good for those who need to know ""how"" to study.Retaining the information is a definite for any studyingyou do where, afterwards, a test is involved. However,you cannot erase memorizing...you either have to rememberwhat you read or the information of how to remember whatyou read. This book may provide you with a method of howto remember an easier way. I did not find this book tobe beneficial to me personally."
5,Truly a revelation !,"Michelangelo's sculptures, paintings and architectures are world renown. However most of us who are not arts experts are hardly aware of the drawings this genius did aeons ago. Hirst has rectified this. This book contains most of Michelangelo's drawings, even those not displayed to the public. I am just a layman and hence am ignorant of all the technical terms involve in studying a piece of drawing. However this does not stop me from enjoying Michelangelo's myriad masterpiece drawings. I am very glad indeed to be educated on another angle of this great genius."
5,Fantastic book,"This beautiful book gives a history of the tiger, their habits, role in myth, man's perceptions of the tiger, including history of conservation efforts and a view to the future. Great photos."
4,The Wacky Board Game Family,"Don't let the length of the instructions steer you away from this fabulous game. It takes a few rounds before you can play without checking the instructions. But once you get the hang of it, you'll be a fan forever."
2,Dog and Cat story.,"Widget lives in a house with six female cats. One day a puppy arrives with no owner and Mrs. Diggs, the keeper of all these animals, sets out to find the puppy's owners. Widget's job was puppy watching and he was horrible at it. The story shows all the naughty things a puppy does and how Widget isn't doing his job to dog sit him. At some points in this story I liked the drawings but for the most part I didn't. Some were creative, sketchy and watercolored well and others were dull. The word 'puppy' appeared atleast two times on every page and became drone after a few pages. Having had puppies myself, I wanted to enjoy this reading but found myself hoping the next page would make the book better."
3,Nice movie about arithmetic,"Very interesting movie about the story of Arithmetic...but it lacks information about the Mayan number system, older than the Hindu and who ""discovered"" zero too!"
2,Too much often equals nothing,"This yarn has everything in it but the kitchen sink. It is fast paced, confusing, and yet somewhat boring. Not my cup of tea."
5,Every newly diagnosed MS sufferer MUST read this book.,This book was my life line when I was first diagnosed with MS. I read it from cover to cover so many times that it practically dropped to bits and whenever I hear of another newly diagnosed MS sufferer I loan it out. It gave me hope when I had none.
2,Disappointed,"I do not care for this book. Could only read about half before I had to stop. It is opinionated and the informantion presented is not qualitatively backed up with equations, etc. While i am not a antenna engineer i am an electrical engineer and i found the book annoying from an analytical standpoint."
1,Extremely disappointing,"I was excited to find a book on PCOS that was a full-length personal account, but this book was surprisingly disappointing. Like the previous reviewer mentioned, there are numerous typing and grammar mistakes that distract the reader. I could ignore one or two, but there are several per page. I also found the book to be poorly organized (not by aspect of disease, not even chronologically!). It offers very little in the way of factual information; in fact, the author makes some unsubstantiated assertions that could be dangerous if readers take them as fact.The book was neither informative nor enjoyable. Women would be better off reading some of the more biomedically-based books, intimidated or not. I had high hopes for ""Death of a Dancer"", but it fell short."
3,Good phone bad interception,"I´ve had this phone, with two handsets, for over a year and a half. I love that I can use it as an intercom. I don´t have to walk upstairs to go look for my husband after I´ve placed a caller on hold when I´m in my office downstairs. If I´m cooking, I clip the phone to my belt and use the headset. Clarity has been fine. The big problem has been the location of one of the handsets. It´s in the TV room, where there are many electronics, and it´s impossible to use because of the static. I like to have it there because of the intercom and caller ID features. It´s the room where I need it the most so I can get to my husband without leaving my office. I´ve left it there in spite of the static and bought a cheaper phone. That way he can use the other one to talk after I´ve told him over the intercom that he has a call. None of the other handsets have the static problem."
1,Incredibly Bad,"When I read awful books like this one, I am amazed at how they ever got published in the first place. It is poorly written on too many levels. Do not waste your time with this one!"
1,Lawsuit waiting to happen,"I guess I got a bad one too because I just purchased this 2 days ago and its make loud popping noises when on the high setting. It didn't throw any sparks but it turned it self off. I too was able to finish my hair, but after reading the previous reviews about this joker throwing sparks, Im getting ready to return it and get my money back. Do not purchase, dangerous and unsafe appliance that needs to be pulled off the market."
3,Needs Stiffer Brush,The genuine boars bristle brush is too soft and will not turn or lift my hair. The bristles just squish out and do not stay stiff enough to work hair. I think the boars bristles would be even worse with thick hair. They need a stiff nylon brush option. They also need a medium speed for drying. You get slow low and fast high and if you can hold your finger on the quick heat button then maybe you can get to medium heat and blowing speed from the low setting but you can't hold the button for long. There should be some sort of trigger with the quick heat button built in or a way to lock it down. I don't use the other two attachments. I'd swap them for two different brushes or one good stiff brush attachment.
2,hot!,"This dryer DOES NOT have 3 heat setting. It only has hot, with 2 air flow settings. Set on HIGH, it may burn your hair, hands, and/or scalp. It's probably good for thick, coarse hair, but I wouldn't recommend it for thin or fine hair. The cool button is useless since it only has one speed (low). Go for the Revlon amber waves instead."
2,"I'm sorry to say this, but...","Can you say ""I didn't get it"" about a book? Yes? OK, then - I didn't get it! Couldn't understand the point of it. Maybe cause it seems like these characters couldn't understand the point of living. They just didn't seem interested in their own lives. I read to the end just to see if anything remotely interesting happens that can give some meaning to the whole book. No such luck.I dearly love Tyler's ""Accidental Tourist"", but something was amiss on this one. Or maybe, as I said, I just didn't get it."
3,no countown tmer,casio has substituted the valuable countdown timer function for the data storage feature in this and many of the newer g-shock models....other than this the watch is the usual g-shock quality - i like the fact that its not as bulky as some of the other models
2,Disappointed especially for price,"I got this watch thinking it would be great for me to travel overseas and use as a pill reminder. The watch is like a man's watch. I could barely feel the vibration on my wrist and I am very sensitive to the touch. The audible alarm is no louder than my current women's Timex Expedition which is definitely much more attractive. I don't look forward to spending the time and money to ship it back. I suppose for some, it works in some situations."
1,Terrible,"This book was recommended to me by an actual SPY!I found it boring. The characterization of Russians, Israelis, and Arabs were very heavy handed and charicaturish. more precisely, the character of the Hezzbolah Sheik was totally unbelieivable, he seemed to say things that would be impossible to imagine someone in his position saying.. really bad boring stupid book which i threw away a quarter of the way in!This is absolutley not like early lecarre with his subtle characters and nuanced plots.Thumbs down!"
2,A Novel of Disappointment,"I read about 100 pages of this book, and found that I didn't care about any of the characters in it, even though several are the same person. The plot looked terrific, but I found the book to be plodding and introspective with nothing to look forward to. If you are expecting a spy thriller, skip this one."
3,A Nice Reference Book That Could Have Been Much Better,"I was pretty disappointed by this book. First of all,there are a bunch of omissions(Where's Grave Digger?). Secondly,there are way too many bands in here that just don't belong in a book about heavy metal(Bryan Adams,Prodigy,Loverboy,Prism). He also considers many bands ""hard rock"" when they are actually metal bands. I think this book could have been better if it was written by a serious metal fan rather than a music generalist like Martin Strong. However,the track listings are very useful for trivia purposes,and the illustrations(caricatures of different bands)are great fun. Try Headbangers:The Worldwide Megabook Of Heavy Metal Bands for a much better book of this kind."
5,Very nice shoes.,"I'd originally been looking for a pair of Jordan XIIIs when I came across these. The had a similar styler and were half the price so I decided to order them. I'm very glad I did. I'm actually thinking of ordering a second pair. These shoes fit great, really nice clean look, and good construction. no need for Jordans at this point."
4,Almost comfy,"They are awesome shoes except the shoe laces dig into my ankles a bit. No blistering or anything, but not quite as comfortable as I would like."
5,The Music DOES make the movie,"I saw the movie when it came out, and a few times on cable over the years, and loved it. So when the DVD came out, I bought it. Major disappointment!! Apparently, the idiots who made the movie failed to secure the rights to use the music in the DVD release. The bland and generic rock they used just killed the film. So- I bought the soundtrack.It's just as great as my memories! As I listened to Hagar's ""Heavy Metal"", I realized it was the music that made the film. Without it- the movie is flatassed boring.Now- I just watch the DVD without sound and que the soundtrack at the appropirate moments. It works."
5,We Love It,"We love it ,the picture is so great,you will not be disappointed.We did a lot of searching and Amazon was the best price.Eagle delivered it on the day and time it was suppose to and they did just what the white glove service said it would, bring it in, remove the TV from the box, plug it in to test it, and take away the box."
5,Buy this,"The no glare screen is perfect if you have a lot of light in your room. This TV has a great picture and the sound is so so, but I've got mine hooked up to surround sound so it doesn""t really matter. I know of two other people with exactly the same TV and they also love it."
4,Good TV,"So far so good. This TV is very good, the only shame is that i don't have any content in 1080p to show on its beautiful screen, but i'm planning on buying a blu-ray player soon to really see its full potential."
5,Kudos,You will not be disappointed with this Samsung product. It was billed as the #1 LCD HDTV om the market by a professional A/V installer that I know.Amazon was by far the best value!!! Service - excellent!!!
5,Awesome Picture,"I purchased this television at the beginning of May directly from Amazon. I had previously read that there had been issues with this television with HDMI connections and some pillaring and clouding. I have yet to have any issues, but I would recommend trying out the tv as much as possible to make sure the set is clean of issues. Besides this, the picture is amazing. HD tv cannot get any better and SD tv is the same as my previous 32"" lcd. I cannot praise this tv enough and I enjoy watching the NBA playoffs on it as well as my friends. This is a must buy tv!"
1,Red vertical line after 18 months,"We were happy with this tv for about a year and a half when a vertical line started appearing on the side of the screen. We called Samsung but since we didn't buy the extended warranty Samsung wouldn't help us and the repair is $1200 for a new panel. Who is going to pay $1200 for a tv repair? So buy the extended warranty, or better yet, don't buy a Samsung."
1,Stop working after 18 month!!!!,This TV stopped working after 18 month. Black strips appeared on the screen. Very bad quality. This is the worst quality TV that I ever had. Do not buy this!I will never buy samsung again!
1,"2009, thats when it change. Don't buy.","2009 is when the reviews for this tv changed, (seriously, the last review here of 08 is 5*, the first of 09 1*)it is when the people who bought it earlier have had their warranties expire and the problems begin which sammy does not care about. This tv will work great for 15 months too 31 months(mine), please read only recent reviews of this 1800$ bic lighter.Instead of trying to explain what my tv does here is a video I found on youtube that shows it, a video is worth a thousand words.[...]again, DO NOT BUY!!!Just saw I can't link youtube here(sorry about that amazon)so go to youtube and paste this in the search box-> Samsung LNT4661f problem brown screen <- the video that comes up shows what mine and many others are talking about with the picture.No clicking or going on and off on its own yet, but there is a video on youtube for that also.so please, from the bottom of my heart, don't buy this."
1,Do NOT buy Samsung- TV lasted 2 years like everyone else!,"This tv was okay the first two years, and then it started to have dark splotches when I turn it on. It is completely unviewable for about an hour until it warms up.Samsung sent a repairman to replace the bad capicitors, but that did nothing for this problem. The repairman said the display itself would need to be replaced for a low $900 plus labor!! What an outrage! Shame on Samsung!I spent nearly $1500 on this piece of crap a few years ago and now it is totally useless. Weren't LCD tvs supposed to last for 10 years?"
4,No unpleasant surprises,"Samsung LNT4661F 46"" 1080p LCD HDTVThis 46-inch LCD HDTV was delivered and `white-gloved' by Amazon,as promised. Since we tend to watch 4x3 movies on TCM more thananything else, we have to be satisfied for the moment with non-HDreception, and with a black vertical stripe on each side. But the TVpicture is quite sharp (to our eyes, at least) at a 15-foot viewing distance,and just the right size for us. We also enjoy looking at a `slide show'by attaching our digital camera to the TV, and we can even use thescreen as a computer monitor so that several people can see it at thesame time.We're waiting to buy a DVD recorder/player once the HD vs Blu-Raycompetition goes one way or the other. Until then, so far, so good."
5,LOVE this tv,"I bought this TV about a month ago and I'm VERY happy with it. I got mine through Electronics Expo through Amazon and shipping was a cinch. It came earlier than expected and the shipper emailed me a tracking number. I've really had no issues with it, other than some random clicking noises when I first turn on the thing and then again when I turn it off. It doesn't seem to affect the tv performance at all. I have yet to hook up a gaming console but the HD quality through my cable channels is amazing! I also have my Apple TV hooked up to it and its fantastic. I have mine in my tiny one bedroom apartment and its the perfect size. No complaints, quality is great and the tv is light enough to lift on my own."
3,Good but not particularly memorable,"I'll admit I've only read the first of the ""Aunt Dimity"" series. While I found ""Aunt Dimity's Death"" charming and a delightful read, I put it down without any desire to read the others. For similar fare that I revisit over and over, I usually turn to Elizabeth Goudge. While Goudge's work is far more ""primitive"" and lacks the special effects, I find her characters much more endearing, people I would like to have as close friends. ""Aunt Dimity's"" characters seem more like acquaintances."
1,Aunt Dmity's Death,"I have not yet read this book. It is on my summer stack ""to read"" books. Hence the reason I have given it just 1 star, though I'm sure that after I read it I will probably give it no less than 3 or 4 stars.HOWEVER,I purchased it because I had read two other Aunt Dimity novels (""Aunt Dimity's Seed Cake"" and ""Aunt Dimity and the Family Tree"") both of which I purchased when I was on vacation in San Francisco in June and both of which books I left for my daughter-in-law to read.These are very easy reading books and interesting as well.I can say, too, that the book arrived here in excellent condition."
5,The real meaning of mystery -- mysterious,"I think I'm in love. I've found a new (to me) writer who pulls me into her story from the first sentence and keeps me engrossed until the last.AUNT DIMITY'S DEATH has no murder. So what? It has mystery, in the classic sense of the word. As a mystery writer myself (with a cat in my books, not a stuffed rabbit), I know that sometimes throwing dead bodies around can be the easy way out. It take a great deal of skill to invoke mystery without necessarily involving mayhem. If you haven't read this treasure yet, rest assured that Reginald, the stuffed rabbit, is heart-warming without ever becoming cloying.Nancy Atherton is a joy. I'm looking forward to the rest of her series, which I plan to read in order."
4,Not your usual cozy mystery,"I hadn't read much on what this book was about, only assuming it was another normal cozy mystery. It started out strong and fun with Lori finding out her mother's secret and that Aunt Dimity was a real person. Lori's personality was solid and I learned to like her. But as soon as she got to the cottage, it got to be a little odd.The story unfolded as a friendly supernatural tale with a touch of mystery. The mystery wasn't a strong driving force, it simply unfolded. There didn't seem to be any red herrings or figuring out whodunit. It was more of a journey that you went on, following in Lori's footsteps.This book asks you to suspend disbelief for a little while. It is an entertaining read and had good moments of humor as well. I'd actually like to rate it 3 1/2 stars, but will leave it at 4. I will probably pick up the next in the series to read as well, out of curiosity. But I'm doubtful as to if it will stay in my permanent collection."
2,Not what I was looking for...,"I'm a big fan of the Laurie R. King 'Mary Russell' books - and was hoping for something to keep me occupied between publications. Ordered several books in the 'cozy' genre... including this one. It was just ok for me. Sort of like eating junk food... fine at the time, but you feel guilty afterwards for having indulged. Personally, I won't be reading any more in the series.If you're into fluff/romance type cozies - you'll probably enjoy this series. However, if you're looking for a somewhat brainier experience, stick to Mary Russell. The series I found that falls in the middle of this book and the Mary Russell books is the Amelia Peabody series... a little brains, a touch of mystery, and some romance... fluff, but with a tongue and cheek approach that makes it a little easier to swallow."
4,A new series for me!,"I really enjoyed this ""mystery"". While I wouldn't say it was a traditional mystery in the murderous sense of the word or even a criminal sense, I still didn't mind settling down and getting cozy with Lori, Bill, Reginald (the bunny) and of course A. Dimity herself. Adding a ghost to the novel made it refreshing and not the least bit hokey or scary. I am setting out to read the next in the series."
3,Not Bad,"Less or simple examples, and focus more on control maths than practical applications. It lacks details, and strong examples. Many students had problem follwing this book. You definetly need addition book as a refrence."
2,bad book,As a Graduate student. I think this book is very hard to understand. I took long hours to understand some of the topics especially the space state representations.You should know very well your fundamentals of control system and I recommend to take the Linear System SPace Systems before of this class.If you understand chapter 2 completely... you will not have problem with the rest of the book.
4,"""Buggy lights""...great for the RV","When we took our 2yr old camping, we discovered she had a dislike of bugs. Now with these bug lights hanging on the RV, she's come to realize some bugs are okay, and always wants the ""buggy lights"" turned on at dusk."
1,Great features - phone did not work,"After reading some of the reviews, we took a chance since the phone had the features we needed. After charging overnight, we tried using the phone and the first call was great. When we took it to another room the connection was gone & the phone started blinking. If you put it back on the base, picked it up & made a call immediately, everything was fine. If you took it from the base and tried to use it in a minute or so, it would not work. Called Clarity and they said the phone was not programmed to blink, we had a bad unit and to return it. Wish it had worked because this was for a Father's Day present and the features on the phone were exactly what we wanted. Returned the phone to Amazon - did not try a second one."
1,NOT TO HAPPY,"ORDERED THIS PHONE FOR MY FATHER. AFTER CHARGING OVER NIGHT THE HANDSET HAD NO DIAL TONE. MADE SURE EVERY THING WAS INSTALLED ACORDING TO INSTRUCTIONS, LET IT CHARGE FOR ANOTHER DAY---STILL DIDN'T WORK. SENT IT BACK."
5,Looks cool!!!,"Metroid Prime 2 looks cool. Although I have not played any of the other Metroid games, this one sounds cool to me. I am going to get it because of its gameplay and screenshots I saw. And all you Halo 2 fans out there, don't thing this is going to be dumb just because it is from Nintendo. Halo 2 is good, and so is this. They both have strongs and weaknesses. So if you have a gamecube and a xbox buy both games!!!!!!!!"
5,Sorry Master Cheese Samus kicks your ***,Metroid Prime 2 is amazing. Multiplayer is going to be da bomb.I dont have the game but am hoping to get it. I dont have an XBox only ps2 and gc so i dont have halo 2.(...). and nintendo has got an impressive game.
2,"Same game, Different name, Who's to blame? Retro!","Don't get me wrong, I love this game. So why do I give it a bad overall score? You'll see.After completing this game (And the first) twice, I think I know what I'm talking about.On the + side:Prime GraphicsFrom the enviroments to the details, IT LOOKS AS FANTASTIC AS THE FIRST!Prime GameplayAs fun as the first! They got rid of the Chozo Ghosts, too!Prime ControlsThey didn't change, so they're as good as the first!On the - side:Unprime SoundThe effects are still great, and the music still isn't!Unprime MultiplayerThis wins the PGOTY award! (Pointless Gimmick Of The Year) It seems to pass through your mind as if affected by a jedi mind trick.Unprime SimilarnessIf you've played Prime 1, you've aleady played this game!All the new features feel more like gimmicks, And the ammo system makes it frustrating.Overall, this game is fun, but too similar to the original.Retro, how come you took no risks in your sequel?"
4,Difficult,"I love the Metroid series, and overall this is a decent game. Play control is easy and graphics are great. However, it's pretty long and really tough. Also, the landscapes aren't as rich or varied as the original Metroid Prime - it's overall a bit gloomier. I'd only recommend this for hardcore gamers with time on their hands."
2,Very disappointing,"With all due respect to Dr. Ablow, I thought he was really over-reaching in his analysis of someone he never met. The book was filled with repetitive analytic conjecture about almost every sentence Scott ever spoke. Sometimes a duck is just a duck. Dr. Ablow repeatedly states how Scott ""probably said ...."", or ""probably thought..."" and Lacy ""probably replied..."" The book is filled with these fictional guesses as to the thoughts and feelings that MAY have occurred. Scott's apparent sociopathic behavior was traced in part to the murder of his maternal grandfather more than 50 years before Scott was born. It's obvious that, to a great extent, our personalities are the result of our parental upbringing, but to relate dates of negative events in the life of Jacqueline Peterson to dates of negative events in Scott's life is patently ridiculous. Overall, I felt that this was just one more opportunity to take advantage of this sensational case to sell a book. Very disappointing."
4,An Unhealthy Mind,"A very thorough exploration into the makings of a killer. Mr. Ablow's message is consistent with his premise that a man such as Peterson is lost forever if he is unable/unwilling to feel his own pain and grieve for his many losses.At times, the book states the same thing in several different ways. This reminds me of the writings of Ann Rule."
4,"""The truth always wins""","After thinking I could no longer stand to hear or read another word about Scott Peterson, this book seemed to jump out at me yesterday while I was browsing at the library. I guess the title really got me. As Catherine Crier mentions in the Forward ""no longer do people ask DID Scott Peterson murder Laci...instead they want to know WHY."" What goes on inside that head of his???I really enjoyed this book. I just started it yesterday and am finished today. It reads very fast and it kept me turning the pages. Even if you are fed up with everything Scott, I still think you may find this book worth the read. It explains the dead pan look on Scott's face during the entire trial and his utter lack of any emotion including the fake tears he shed on Good Morning America. Dr. Ablow gives his opinion on why he believes Scott is the way he is. I found it to be very fascinating, though I dont know if I agree with all of Dr. Ablow's beliefs and viewpoints."
1,Not recommended....,"This book wasn't worth the original price in hard cover, now I see the latest 'NEW' price for mass marketing paperback is $149.99 (as of 11/21/1011). Dr. Ablow appears to be a mind unto himself. Basically, I think he is a few bricks shy of a load. I wouldn't recommend this book, or his new book about Casey Anthony even though I haven't even read the new one, just because of what appears to go on (or not go on, as the case maybe) 'inside the mind of Dr. Ablow.'"
1,Not worth reading.,"This book is an absolute joke. After watching Keith Ablow on Court TV being interviewed by Catherine Crier, I could not wait to get this book. It was a complete disappointment. The writing was poor including the grammar. He repeats himself time after time to take up space in a book that is full of blank pages. Save your money. This book is not worth reading."
3,A Bit of a Letdown,"A good read, but not quite what I was lead to believe it would be. Quite a lot of speculation on the author's part for not having sat down with Scott Peterson in person. In my opinion, the section on his mother's upbringing and young adulthood is the most fascinating part of the book, revealing, as it does, how Scott became a sociopath."
5,HIGHLY RECOMMEND ALL OF ED EMBERLEY'S DRAWING BOOKS!,"Believe it or not children's drawings end up looking much like Ed Emberley's. Line by line and shape by shape the Halloween related objects take form. Our other family favorite was Emberley's ""Big Red Drawing Book"". Absolutely love these books!"
3,"Not as good as ""Five Days in July""","Based on the reviews on this website, I bought Casino as my second Blue Rodeo CD (first being Five Days in July). For me, Five Days just seems to flow more smoothly and is more pleasurable to listen to. There are a couple of songs on Casino that I immediately didn't like and always skip right over. I think I'll try yet another Blue Rodeo CD to expand my awareness of Blue Rodeo, but for my vote I would get Five Days in lieu of Casino if you are a first-time listener."
4,Too much fun to fret over flaws,"""Killer Heels"" is a fun read with an interesting protagonist. It is a mystery withlaugh-out-loud humor, substantially different from Donald Westlake, Simon Brett,Aaron Elkins, and Tamar Myers, all blenders of serious crime and comedy. The mysteryportion is not as good as the story. The second murder requires a fanaticalbelief in the incompetence of cops, and the clue that provides the ""aha"" would getthe killer a starring role with Jay Leno's stupid criminals. Even with those flaws,I've already started the next book in the series. Almost all the reviewers with namesthat allow a gender guess seem to be female. This old man enjoyed the book a lot."
5,this is great,Ive been waiting for classic childrens TV like this to be rediscovered for years. Lets not kill chances for further releases just because you dont like the host of this set. This is americana at its best. Please release more soon.
3,The Jury is still out.,"I have taken this supplement for several months, with minor noticeable change. I will continue to monitor the progress. Very reasonably price."
1,"Terrible, just terrible","This book was so bad I had to get on here and tell a few people. ... It's the worst piece of garbage I've seen in a long time. It's definitely not worth the [money] I paid for it. The games shown in this book are banally simple. Worse yet, lots of the examples have errors or exhibit pretty poor coding techniques. The author is neither a games expert nor a Delphi expert. Why he would write a book like this and how he could find someone to publish it is beyond me."
1,2D games only!,"This book only covers 2D sprite games. What a waste! On top of that, I can't get many of the examples to work. I bought the book expecting to learn the secrets of games development in Delphi. What a letdown! I give up!"
1,A waste of print if ever there was one,"This book does not deserve your time. It does not cover modern games programming, offers no insight into anything relevant to high-end games development, and exposes nothing except the authors lack of knowledge of the subject material. It is at best a remedial primer, but, uses such poor Delphi techniques and coding practices that it's really beneath beginners."
1,Worthless,"This book really is quite bad. The examples don't work, and, let's face it, Ayres can't write. There are enough typos and outright errors in this book to fill a couple chapters. Can't find anything good to say about it -- it's just completely worthless."
2,Confusing,"There is a HUGE difference between 'overweight' and 'obesity. I feel that this was not reflected in the book, and the messages are therefore not accurate or reliable.However, I do agree that dieting is not a solution and the dieting industry is largely setting people up to fail."
5,EXCELLENT,"One Last Time was a sure thing to read.I am A believer in the other world, and I truly see my late father in the last 13 years, and know that he is always around me.The book and John Edward keep me going and each day I truly watch his progam each chance I get.Thank you John Edward!"
2,I luv John Edward~,"This man is an amazing talent and wonderful person. I have seen him in person and watched all of his television shows. But, I have to admit I was disappointed with this disk set. Maybe it was me, but I just didn't seem to connect with the information he was providing or the exercises it puts you through. Sorry, John :("
4,Good for the price,Obviously not a high quality product but it was what I was expecting for the price and my son had fun with it for Halloween. Didn't get more than I expected but it was fine. I would purchase it again for a one off occasion like that.
3,Good Basic Costume...,"After I dolled up the costume with some sparkly trims and some fabric glue, my son felt good and scarey in the Dracula outfit. This costume fulfills its intended use, although it was trashed after 4 wearings. Serves its purpose..........."
5,Who the heck is Louis Gibson and when did he go deaf?,"This album is fantastic, Louis, what's wrong with you? Write the backs of cereal boxes, instead of reviews. Okay?"
2,I used this book and scored 510 on the GMAT,"1 - The first few chapters gave helpful points about how to approach the test, especially the essay part.2 - The math practice questions were just like the test, but the explanations to the answers weren't very helpful.3 - The English questions were just like the test and the explanations were better written than the explanations for the math answers."
3,I don't feel like playing this game anymore.,I don't like this game. My name is Dominic James DeVetis and I am 7 years old. This game is too hard and too compelcated. I got this game for Christmas. I don't know why I got this game. It was probaly my big brother who got it.
1,Disapointing,I thought this game was going to be okay well i was wrong ' see im new to the mario rpg games now and now the game just got boringWhy did it get boring ?Because its impossible to get passed chapter 7 section where mario has to walk on these blue panels to avoid being shocked ' I even asked how to do this but they said stay in the middle and thats what i did and still it did not work and they were not specific about it ' So i plan on selling this game to someone who is good at itIf you dont like hard difficult impossible games then this is not the game you want you ll just get annoyed and yell at the top of your lungs because you cant get passed nothing on here ' so the game is boring because i cant get passed chapter 7 and i give up on itOther then that it could be impossible to also get passed chapter 8 especially i heard the final boss has 150 HP thats alot ' and totally impossibleSo this is my opinion and feel free to flame me for itDont waste your money
5,New spin on Mario......,Its the perfect spin on a mario game. Its totally different its more like a rpg than the Mario titles were use to. At times its really challenging but what game isn't. If your a Mario fan you should pick up this game.
2,what,when i got this game i thought it would be a good game . when i got it i didnt know what i was doing . what was the point if the game . it was 50$ for nothing 0 zero zip zilch. the first day i got it i played it but never played it again
3,paper mario,This is a great game! Fans of mario RPG's should love this. New charters old ones returning this is an awsome game! The negitive side is it get's boring after a while.
4,Great game but too much reading,"This is a very fun game but, to be honest I am kind of disipointed. The reason why is because there is waaaay!, too much dioluge to be reading. I mean, if I wanted to read this much I would of read the dictionary. Anyway, there are some well points about this game starting with the fact that the graphics are unbelievabley greatly detailed. The gameplay is also well done. It brought back the same anjoyable fun from the original game for the Nintendo64. I love this game! Though, it could of been better."
3,I wish it had been cheaper,"It is pretty scratched. Overall, I am happy though. I got to play my favorite game again, which is exciting!! :)"
5,Seems to keep stable power at the rated setting.,"Needed a replacement power supply for an X-Rite densitometer used in the printing industry, but was concerned about several models that were listed as unreliable in their voltage regulation. This is very important, because running sensitive devices at 9 or 10 volts when they are expecting only 6 volts can end up ruining the devices. In this case, an under $20 power supply ruining an over $300 densitometer. Glad to say the reviews on the Velleman Compact Universal DC Adapter Power Supply were as accurate as the Velleman itself. Right now, this is the only universal DC power supply I'll buy."
3,Fine enough while it lasts.,"PROS*Convenient volume control on the ear bud set itself.*Sound quality is very good.*At the time that I bought it from Amazon (over 2 years ago) it was half the price of most ear buds of the same quality.CONS*Frays within months, with frequent use, and must be replaced. [I bought aJVC HAF140GN Gumy Headphone (Green). So far so good, but no volume control on the buds like Genius.]"
5,In time you will learn...,"While ""Billy Breathes"" was by far the most accessible Phish album ever, ""Ghost"" can seem, at first,strange and esoteric but after you give it the mandatory 5 listens, it slowly changes its complexion. The album has three distinct parts. The first with ghost, birds, meat and Guyute is pretty obscure with songs that are not songs even though they embrace the format, the second which is more like an interlude with Fikus and Shafty is quiet with strange intonations, it seems to prepare you for the rest which starts brillantly with Limb by Limb and ends with end of session. These three parts though give the album an overall sense of ""completeness"". It is not live Phish, it is not supposed to be Live Phish, it is an exercise in style and it is beautifully executed."
3,This album is really a big freak out! Ahhhhhhh!!!!!!,"So I bought this album from Amazon and I'm kind of groovin, you know rockin out. Then, all of sudden out of nowhere, I'm scratching at the friggin walls. I mean, the fourth song pops on and its like boom! Home run. Out of the park. No questions asked. I thought ""holy crap man"" this sounds like my Uncle Bootnee Lee (his real name's Tom Snyder but he changed it for obvious reasons). The song sounded exactly like the one he used to sing to me when I was younger. Exactly. Except Phish uses a guitar and my uncle just used an empty canned ham tin, a broomstick, and some rubberbands. The lyrics were also a little different. Well, come to think of it they were a lot different. Only one or two words were the same. I like Phish's version better because they don't make me do chores when they're done singin'. Thanks Amazon. Thanks a lot. Doug Rutledge, NJ"
4,"One of Judy's Best, But Not ""THE"" Best.","WILDFLOWERS contains what is probably Judy's best known recording, a cover of Joni Mitchell's ""Both Sides Now"", which became her biggest hit. There are many other tracks as well that make this album essential Judy. ""Michael From Mountains"", another great Joni Mitchell composition, and Judy's own ""Since You Asked"" are other hightlights. But if you only get one Judy Collins album, get IN MY LIFE, which ranks as Judy's very best."
2,Show music to hum to,"This is a fine collection of songs from the musicals of Rodgers and Hammerstein. But by and large, it is only instrumental music. If you're looking for Rodgers AND Hammerstein, i.e., music and lyrics, look elsewhere."
3,pop pop pop pop pop,"Tasty, mildly psychedelic power pop from a one-man band from California. Badfinger meets the Left Banke after shaking hands with Jellyfish. It won't change the world, but if you're a fan of this style, you'll dig it a lot."
5,great product,These DVDs are great. Our family has enjoyed watching them and following the Sarah and John Conner story. It is a little twist on the Terminator movies which we loved and left us wanting more!
5,A lot faster than wireless,"I used this cable to go from one end of my house to the other. Once plugged in, I was surfing the internet faster than with my wireless router. Great product."
2,Par for the course,"I picked this up because my library had it labeled as Fiction, so I was disappointed to find it was yet another murder mystery, not my favorite genre. This one was better than most gay-themed mysteries as the author wasn't trying to dazzle us with his non-stop wit and writes competently. But like most mysteries, this was full of the coincidences and implausabilities that are the stock-in-trade of mystery writers. The protagonist is not particularly likable, just so attractive that he has to fight off ""pretty boys"" with a stick and treats his would-be boyfriends badly because he's just too hot to give up his promiscuous life. The voodoo visions and tarot card readings didn't help but were easily skipped, and by the 100th time he invoked his ""Goddess"" or his brother called him ""my queen,"" I was quite ready to skim. I blame my local library for misrepresentation, since as mysteries go this was par for the course."
4,I love it.,"I love this camera so much. It's great for anyone who would like to be introduced to digital photography. It takes great pictures in all its modes. The Scene Modes are great and work well for the specified scene, if you don't know how / don't like to program your own settings. It may feel bulky to some, but to me, the weight is ideal. A quick note: in some used DX7440s, the shutter gets stuck closed. All you have to do is tap the lens barrel (NOT LENS) gently with a pencil for several minutes and it should get unstuck. Other than that, it's great for beginners."
1,DX7440 returned as defective,"Because of the glowing reviews on this page, my decision to purchase a DX7440 was reinforced. Unfortunately, when the purchase arrived, it turned out that the ""Made in China"" camera was defective. There was a large black spot in the center of all photos which appeared to be the fault of either a defective CCD or a severe problem with the optics. Either way, the camera was unusable, and it was returned for a refund.And therein lies the good thing about Amazon: They will accept a return within 30 days, no questions asked. Kodak technical support was essentially useless, because support appears to be offshored to people who do not speak English as their first language.Needless to say, Kodak cameras are now on my ""do not buy"" list."
4,Lovely,"Always a classic, this is almost as wonderful as the original, but with the new release of the re-mastered original cast, I would probably stick to that recording. This is delightful as well though, even if the re-wording of It Depends On What You Pay (in order to remove the use of the word ""rape"" so as not to offend..) seems obvious,forced and ludicrous. I don't think anyone would find the old context offensive..it couldn't have been more innocently done..."
1,Wrong,"the premise of this book is wrong.the facts in this book are wrong.It is biased, it is one-sided."
4,GREAT COMMENTARY!!!!!,"Nice cowboy documentary film with a very informative cowboy commentary. Overall good print quality with some bad splicing during dialogue at one spot. My copy had some digital break-up in spots during the film which looked like they occured during the production process. The extra TV documentary on ghost towns is quite good with no break-ups. It says it is program #3, but I have not been able to find any other episodes of this program listed."
3,No Alfred Hitchcock!,This book does NOT include Alfred Hitchcock; instead it's been revised to be some author named Horace Sebastian. How irksome.
1,Not that great; Zipper tabs broke twice,"First off, the bag is pretty small and doesn't fit very much in it. the main compartment is sort of like a black hole or the bermuda triangle. Things go in and never come out. Other than that, the bigger problem we had was that the metal tab of the zipper (what you hold on to to open and close the zipper) broke not once but twice. The first time, we shipped it back to the manufacturer and they repaired it and sent it back. Another one just broke and this time we're just going to return it. we're not particularly rough with the zipper tabs, nor are we big ogres who have really strong grips and can bend and break metal. I would recommend a different bag and wouldn't purchase one from Diaper Dude again, personally."
1,"Way too small, waste of money","This diaper bag is cute. That's all there is to say for it! I got it for my first baby and could only use it if I had a second bag to put all the baby stuff in that wouldn't fit in the diaper dude. the front zip pockets are tiny, as are all the compartments. I spent 60 bucks on this and now I use a reusable grocery bag that cost $2 because it's so much better! If I had that $60 back I'd go buy a nice normal Graco diaper bag like all my friends have. Grrr."
2,Baby is 3 weeks old and bag is already falling apart!,"My son is only 3 weeks old! The bag is already ripping inside! The lining is detaching from the bag! To top it off - the bag feels uncomfortable on my shoulders. And it hurts my back. I wish I hadn't wasted my money. I bought a Jeep bag backpack style bag from Wal-Mart for $20, and so far I'm liking it much much better!"
5,"Poignant, Funny, Well Written, and Beautifully Photographed","This book was given to me as a gift, and I thought it was something I'd just keep on my living room table and flip through every so often. But once I started reading it, I was enthralled. The photographs are stunning, and KK Ottesen's descriptions of these fascinating people and her trip across the country to find them is truly captivating. I've since bought several more books for friends, and they've all expressed to me how much they love this book."
4,cool jack sparrow pirate gun !,"i needed this for NYC Comic Con, I dressed up as Jack Sparrow. A lot of costume pirate guns aren't that great, and replica's are overly pricey.i found this toy pirates of the Caribbean gun and it was a perfect addition to my costume.it even lights up and fires a gun shot sound and i was able to use the belt...here's my costume...http://c1.ac-images.myspacecdn.com/images02/49/l_b30dac0d676443dfaecd3b4d588bbe9c.jpg"
4,Going Out Strong...,"...I'd like to think this final solo recording of Entwistle captures what he wanted most...a tight touring band, cranking both the Who stuff and his own material. While I haven't got the deluxe CD yet, I will shortly after writing this...call me a fan of a powerful bassist who changed the way the instrument was played, and whose talent and virtuosity puts him in the pantheon of Geddy Lee, Geezer Butler, Charles Mingus, Ron Carter and Jaco Pastorius. I'm sure I missed a few...can just imagine when John got up to Heaven...there's Keith Moon waiting for him with two glasses in his hands, his drumsticks under his arm, and an all-star band warming up behind him (Hendrix, Morrison, Janis, Harrison, Monk, Jr. Wells and Stevie Ray)...and he says, ""John, where the f--- have you been? We've been waiting for you!"""
4,read this to the very last sentence.... the info if amazing,"A bad review of this incredible work only indicates that the person reading it was personally offended by the truth of God.God said he would do these things to us, and he has begun, and this book proves it. It is a MUST read."
3,The right quality for this price range,"I bought two sets awhile back, one beige, one light green. The beige ones seemed to look old pretty quickly, and while they weren't the cleanest looking (I didn't bother ironing) they held up for a while. The green set looks less worn but I haven't used them as often as the other set (although that color is holding up much better than the beige). Decent sheets, nothing extravagant though."
4,"Inexpensive, comfortable, but need ironing","Bought these mostly because the price was so reasonable. We find them very comfortable and generally attractive, but as others have noted if you are fussy you will want to iron these after washing (we don't really care).A good value."
5,Next time go bigger,Got this small pack but finished them so fast had to order again.... Larger packs...
5,Release this on DVD,"Sunrise was just named one of the ten greatest movies of all time by the prestigious British Film Institute. Unlike the AFI (with its tie to Blockbuster and rental profits), this group asks critics and filmmakers their favorite films every 10 years. So if Nosferatu can be on DVD, so should this silent classic of infinite imagination."
2,price/quality,"Being in Control: Natural Techniques for Increasing Your Potential and Creativity for Success in SchoolOn the internet I found an article from the same author with a link at the book Being in Control. The article was very interesting so I thought the book would be very useful too (we have a son with similar problems). I ordered it and was very surprised to get only a low quality print of some 20 powerpoint slides, hardly bound together, instead of a book. As I live in Europe the freight costs + plus the selling price added up to more than 30$. Our son is nearly 14, and when you look at the pictures used, it seems to me that the 'book' is more for younger children, although I'm convinced the techniques could work for older kids too but then 'customised' for their living world."
1,MISLEADING ADVERTISING DO NOT BUY,"PURCHASED THIS BASED ON WHAT WAS WRITTEN AND PICTURE. WAS ASSUMING THIS WAS ALL FOUR SMALL ANIMALS IN NATURE COLLECTION. NO WHERE DOES IT STATE YOU WILL ONLY RECEIVE ONE AND THAT IT IS THEIR CHOICE OF WHICH ONE. WITH SHIPPING I PAID OVER $10 FOR ONE SMALL STUFFED ANIMAL OF THEIR CHOICE. MY ADVICE IS, YOU WOULD BE BETTER OFF GOING TO ANY STORE AND PURCHASING.VERY VERY MISLEADING.SHAME ON YOU AMAZON!WORD YOUR PRODUCTS MORE CAREFULLY"
4,Great Product,"This is a great product. We had minor problems putting them on my car, however worth the price. My boyfriend has had the same wipers for over 6 years. Worth the money."
3,Fish chair,"This is a very cute chair, but it's not made all that great. I had stained it, but I'll have to paint it. I've had it about a year and it just hasn't held up very good."
2,Inferior choline product,"I bought this because of the stated 1200mg choline complex statement not knowing that this product is mainly composed of capsule fillers. I'll tell you exactly what is stated on the supplement label behind the bottle.Serving Size: 1 softgelCalories: 10Total Fat: 1 gPhosphatidyl Choline Complex....1200 mg....(soy lecithin)Typically providing:Phosphatidylcholine.......420mg.....(equivalent to 55 mg of choline)Other ingredients: gelatin, glycerin, purified water (capsule shell), soybean oilNo: Yeast, corn, wheat, gluten, milk , salt, sugar, preservatives or artificial colorOK...so there's phosphatidylcholine at 420 and only 55 mg of choline in that compound. Not accounting for the entire pill itself and only the phosphatidylinecholine alone, there's only 13% actual choline per pill. If you take piracetam, you are going to have to down a ton of pills to reach the 1 gram of choline mark.""55 mg of actual choline""..........what a joke rip off product. Do not buy."
5,The best fig preserves I have ever had,I bought these thinking that I would try something different. These are amazing. Fig preserves are a southern tradition. I make my own fig jam in the summer; I will never be able to make it like this.All fig preserves are pricey and this is no different. This is dense and sweet. Try it on a warm biscuit with butter.
4,"Great case, even if you don't use it for a wallet","I actually emptied what I had in my previous wallet and select the bare necessities to fit inside the ""wallet"" portion of these case (two bank cards, drivers license, and insurance card). Great build quality and precision fit - keeping in mind that these were designed for the 1st generation iPod Nano's. I use this with a 2nd generation Nano (rounded body edges) and it fits [somewhat snug]. You'll need to either a) angle the iPod while it is inside in order to get the charging adapter to connect, or b) remove the iPod completely from the case. Neither are too challenging and my 4 month old iPod still looks new (despite being dropped, sat on, thrown, and pocketed with various coins and keys."
1,Saw this book yesterday at my local library.,"i was wondering about all the hype of this book so i checked it out yesterday from my public library.the book does not have any substance to it. it is just plain in images, it has okay notation but in the end it is no good. if you want to improve your chess just play the game alot and also get a cd rom instead of the books that exist out there. the only good book i recommend is bobby fischers learn to play chess book. it is a simple book but it has alot of images without any notation but it helped me out. now on this book, it is not recommended."
3,Rapid Chess Improvement (Everyman Chess),"I haven't bought this book, but looking at the reviews I have noticed that it ""just"" focuses on tactics.Well, the study of tactics seems quite simple, quoting from Jonathan Levitt: ""Tactics decide games most of the time. Work on 'White (or Black) to play and win' combinations in papers, magazines and the like..."", seems like what he is saying is to just study using some tactics source (probably a book) and just systematically go through them and try to solve them. That doesn't sound very complex to write an entire book on it."
4,Improvement Guaranteed !!!!,"Short, but to the point. This book will talk to you! Makes chess studies clear and logical. It will save you hundreds or even thousands of hours of work. If your rating is below 1800, order it now! Don't even think about it. If the amount of dedication required to complete this course seems unrealistic. You can modify it to fit your schedule, as the author mentions in the book. You will still have Improvement; It just won't be as rapid. I strongly suggest that you follow his advice and also get CT-ART 3.0 from Chess Assistant for your training."
1,Eric Fail For Gardiner,"I'm a fan of some of Gardiner's work. Not this! I am so glad I did not buy it. Not only does the movie not make any attempt to provide a concise trip through its material, but it provides it in such broken fashion that you never know where it is going or why. Also, a large amount of the 75 minutes are nothing but unrelated pictures and music. Seriously, the narrator will take a pause while blurry images of old lamps are shown and rock music played... then more nonsense rambling.... then more pointless, unrelated pictures of household items with piano music...Philip majorly failed here. Did he have something to say? Who the heck knows. There certainly are not any hidden messages or subtext either. This is either a blatant attempt to make money from previously satisfied customers or evidence that Philip's opinion of his own work is not in alignment with his actual skills. I personally believe he needs to check his compasses."
2,This Documentary Was Nothing Short of Elementary...,"A simplistic documentary that, oddly enough, relies on psychedelic visuals and an eclectic soundtrack to carry a lesser Wikipedia article. Sorry, but by the weight of the title, I was expecting more. It wasn't all bad. The narrator's voice was smooth and consistent, and some of the information covered was interesting, such as the Cottingley Fairies, but other mediums have done it much better. My biggest gripe was the long musical interludes between the narrative. I love my music, and if used with the right visuals and context can make for a profound lasting impression. Sadly, this wasn't the case here, the music interludes were merely mechanisms to stretch this documentary to a credible length. Another problem I found was the mastering. The volume levels were all over the place.Both fans of the occult and fans of Sherlock Holmes will be disappointed by this amateur production."
4,Anything but elementary...,"This DVD provides a fascinating, in-depth look at Conan Doyle's complex life and writing career. The film discusses the myriad real-life and supernatural inspirations for characters like Holmes, Moriarty and Watson. After viewing this film, you will understand why Arthur Conan Dolye's life was even stranger than his fiction.Very engaging film."
4,Good buy but the images are very poor,"Obviously the book is good a must have for all who are interested in palmistry.But the images of the hands are not clear.Also, the printing quality is that of a xeroxed book.Hope in subsequent editions these will be better.Nevertheless, its a good buy."
5,Love This Quesadilla Maker!,"Love, Love, LOVE the Oster Quesadilla Maker! These 3 I just bought were gifts for family that have visited and had quesadilla's and grilled cheese sandwiches (made in 1 minute!) & other grilled sandwiches on my Oster."
2,Choppy paragraphs that contain no real significant info,"I thought ""Step into the Light"" was ok, because it brought out some info I did not know, and had some really great pictures. Even though ""STEP"" was mostly a culmination of articles, it still went into finer detail and did not ramble on. ""Step"" brought us to the humble beginnings of ""Millers"" while this book casually mentions the bar, neglecting the significance of where the band members met and developed the band. I found that the new book totally neglected the other band members. There was no real mention of their upbringing, or talents. The pages are full of short paragraphs that basically state everything we already know. It seemed as if the author needed to meet a page quota and just enclosed useless bits of information, for example about a page long explanation about the beginnings of the HORDE FESTIVAL.The book is basically everything that fans put up on the DMBTA message board, slapped on with a fancy cover. Don't buy it!"
5,Flawless Arguement,"The Author gives a water tight, flawless arguement in the book. Of course, the only poor reviews you will find about it are from proclaimed atheists. I've been there, and I know first hand how true the author's writings are."
2,God Doesn't Believe in Atheists,"This guy is barely preaching to the choir. There are a few good paragraphs in it. But as far as arming someone with arguments in favor of God, it isn't useful. His arguments rest on faith....not something that will sway an atheist.If I had glanced through the book at a store, I wouldn't have purchased it.I purchased it at Amazon. The transaction was fine even if the product was sub-standard."
3,Decent Product,"This phone case effectively protects the outside of the phone. The Belt clip, however is poorly designed and is not effective. Nice blue color!"
1,Sound Effects Volume 1 Sounds from in & Around the house,"This is the lamest excuse for a sound effects CD. Save your money and find some kids to go around the house and record toilets flushing, I'm sure you would get more use from that. If I could rate this CD less then 1 star I would."
4,nice,"I expected the color of this to be more of a Martha Stewart green but it is actually a bright grass green. It is also stained, not painted as it appears in the picture. I still like it and think it will look great with a clematis climbing it."
4,Longfellow: A Rediscovered Life,"A pleasant surprise. I bought this biography as a gift but read it myself first. I don't generally admire Longfellow's poetry, except for ""I Heard the Bells on Christmas Day,"" but I appreciate his translations from Danish to English and I love his house in Cambridge. So I agree with this book's thesis: that Longfellow is important not so much for his poetry as for his transmission, even creation, of popular American culture in the 1800s. The book is written with style and held my interest except for some of the details of Longfellow's travels in Europe. Highly recommended."
5,Awesome Book,I had read this book over 20 years ago when I was in my teens. I wanted to re-read it wondering if I would perceive things differently now then back then. Boy did I ever -- Still don't understand how this book got in my hands back then and why my mom did not say anything LOL Way to grown up of a book for a teenager
4,"A great ""adult"" novel from one of my childhood authors.","I remember reading Judy Bloom as a young girl, and I alays found her books entertaining and at many times funny (who can forget Super Fudge?). One of the things I love about her books the most is that they usualy deals with iffy subjects in the most casual and funny way. Wifey was such a fast read, I read it in one day. The issues that the main character deals with are easily relatable, and that made it all the more interesting. I would suggest this one to anyone ready for a slightly steamy, funny and quick read. Way to go Judy!"
2,Boring,Storyline drags on and nothing in her life interesting really happens unless it's a dream or fantasy. It really starts to depress me because her life is so sad and she seems to do nothing about it to improve it and has fantasy's about what she would like to to to change but never does. I take it back... she starts to cheat on her husband with an old flame and I find that depressing as well. I know many people do it but to me it just seems like she's taking the easy way out. I didn't find the main characters likeable and find them wimpy in how they deal with their life and failure of a marriage. I will not finish this book i'm sorry i paid for it on my kindle.
2,Left Me As Frustrated As The Main Character,"This book isn't what I'd call a ""fun"" read. It simply tells the story of a housewife who's got an itch to scratch but goes about it the wrong way.It did have amusing parts, such as the description of her sex life with her husband (how horribly droll!) but in general, today's woman has more control and power in her life, her sexuality and her marriage and, hopefully, will not be able to relate as well to her.I know that a book shouldn't be ""predictable"" but in this case I would have liked a cliché ending of ""happily ever after"". Rather, I was dragged along her journey of frustrations and felt like kicking her along the way."
3,Could've had a better ending.....,"I read this book in only about 4 hours. I couldn't put it down and was disappointed at the ending. The main character is just realizing that she is able to make her own decisions if she only gets some courage and agressiveness. I thought the storyline was very true to life for the time period it was written (early 1970's). The fact that Judy Blume was so sexually explicit was a little disturbing at first, but you get used to it after about the second chapter. Its a great read!!"
5,Midnight Nation...soo good,"Very interesting graphic novel about good vs. evil, putting a new twist on a familiar theme while offering something entirely new."
5,Looks great! Way Cheaper Then The Luster,"I kind of grimaced when I saw the price on the Luster Paper. So, I was pleased to see the big price difference in the Glossy. Prints are beautiful."
3,Not what I thought it was...,"I ordered 'Epson Photo-Quality Inkjet paper. I got :""Formerly Photo-Quality Ink Jet Paper, PRESENTATION PAPER, Smooth, non-glare instant drying paper good for scrapbooks, newsletters, and graphical presentations"". My reciept said 'Photo Quality"" Matte and photo-quality is two different things. I am going to keep and use this paper because I don't believe I could get a resolution from Amazon in 2 days from now when I need it and no one else sells this size paper at all in my little town, not even the Office Max where I bought the printer.I know you guys have a lot of products and pages to manage but little things like this is what is going to lose customers. Not good! Please note the description under the picure to the right says: 'Photo-Quality' and the picture says 'Presentation Paper'. Can you understand how this could be confusing?"
2,Emulsion Side,"This paper prints wonderful but the emulsion side has a light light pink or red look to it. Not bright white like regular paper. I am a framer and when I print something out to frame and lay any white matt board over it, it looks pink. Turn the emulsion side over to the back side of the paper and you will see the difference. Otherwise, the Epson products are excellent and the printing if fabulous."
4,Little Miss Neat,"Little Miss Neat, by Roger Hargreaves, is a fun book to read. I would recommend this book to children that are three to seven years old. I recommend this book to children these ages because it is a funny, short book. Also, the book includes good life lessons. This story is an illustration of how the difference of personalities of people will not mess up friendships. Also, it shows how people should accept traits that set others apart from them. This book is very cute and has good lessons. It is a very short book, so it won't bore children. It is also a book that asks the children questions, so they can respond to the book. I have loved this book since I was a little child, and I still love it today! If you buy this book, which you should, you won't regret it!"
5,More Fun from OTR,"Over the Rhine adds to their legacy with a Grammy quality CD. Karin's swooning, ad-libbing gets better with each CD. The depth of this CD is tremendous with outstanding backing musicians and mixing. If the opening song, sounding like Desperado seems a little cheesy as does the songs title, just wait until the second song ""Trouble""; this song is as good as OTR (or anybody for that matter) gets! If you liked Linford singing to Jack's Valentine, you're in for another treat with a fun tribute to Tom Waits ""Don't Wait for Tom"". Ending with ""If a Song Could be President"" Karin singing 'Emmy Lou for Ambassador, World leaders would listen to her' is tongue-in-check funny!"
2,Distressing!,"I never suspected this band, whom I admired, would take such a turn both musically and lyrically, but it has happened. The jazzy, cabaret feel to the album does not appeal. And, most distressing, the childish longings of the Bush-bashing final track just make these folks sound foolish. Sad, sad day!"
4,A good overview of internationalization,"This book is a good review of internationalization in Java. It covers the basic topics like time & date format, string separation, property files, resource bundles, languages methods, etc.My only complaint about the book is it really doesn't have any information that isn't already available on Sun's web site, and it seems that the most critical concepts have little or no examples while on the other hand, it gives detailed time & date format information for every language in the world; even Esperanto.I wish the book had focused more on code and examples, and less on the locale specific details."
5,How to write software that is truly multi-lingual,"In their Java Internationalization, multi-lingual authors Andy Deitsch and David Czarnecki successfully collaborate to show Java users how to write software that is truly multi-lingual by employing Java's highly sophisticated, cutting-edge internationalization facilities. The days of English-only software are numbered and the demands of ecommerce and internationalized software apps for new generations of software development compel software writers to expand beyond the limitations of language boundaries. A very highly recommended addition to all Java reference collections, Java Internationalization is essential for Java developers to bring themselves fully up to speed on the new generation of software development and able to write software no longer limited or restricted by language and cultural boundaries."
3,Above average compilation,This is a great compilation showcasing some of todays hottest club hits. This is not necessarily the mainstream mixes that you hear at your average club.A great addition to any house music fans collection.
1,Adequate but Free elsewhere,"I thoroughly enjoy Vachel Lindsay's poetry. The meter is reminisant of Edgar Allen Poe's verse. The subject matter is that of turn of the century (18th -19th) century. The mores and folkways of the United States were not the same as they are now. Lindsay gives you a cutting edge view of a mid-West American of that period.There is no interactive Table of Contents. That means that you must trudge through the book from front to back or you must hunt-and-peck for pearls.I frequently buy a book for a dollar on Amazon because it includes something like an interactive Table of Contents which the free version from other sources does not. This version on Amazon does not have anything that other independently produced versions have. Therefore I do not recommend paying money for it here. Currently this collection of poems is free on Amazon. By all means, get it here. If Amazon starts to charge for it, look a little further."
1,It's was a fake product!,"I know this product before, very good. But, when I ordered from Amazon it wasn't the same product! Its was altered, mixed with water!"
2,Less than expected!,"This product has changed tremendously! This was the only product on the market that could actually stop outbreaks!! Now, it appears that it is primarily alcohol in content. It doesn't prevent outbreaks and it doesn't numb the pulsating pain associated with the outbreak. Before, this product was a thicker, brown medication. I so wish the company would go back to the original product."
5,A Salute to the Cops of the City of Saginaw,"Mike East did a tremendous job here. I am a police officer in a neighboring jurisdiction to his, live in Saginaw, and see first hand what these brave officers deal with. Now their numbers are shrinking due to a corrupt city hall and apathetic citizens, violent crime is flourishing, yet they still retain their sense of humor on nearly every call they go to. I am always Proud and Honored to back these brave men and women up whenever I have the chance. The Police Officers of the City of Saginaw are true heros who fight for a lost cause. I salute every one of you."
1,A burden indeed?,"I found this book to be a burden on my IQ. The author confirms my beleifs on most law enforcement officials and he fits into my perception perfectly. Filled with self gratifying conceit disguised as drama and the desire to attain special attention - was more than I could handle. Combine the 8th grade level of writing with attention deficit disorder, mix in large portions of self glamore and you have the essence of this book."
3,Futuristic King?,"While reading Diamond I couldn't help but wonder if Reynolds is a Stephen King fan since his tale had the essense of King's Tower Series. Which consequently is based on the poem ""the childe Roland..."" and is about Roland's quest to get to the tower and reach the top."
1,didn't work,"used maybe 3 times. had some trouble with getting it to turn on. Thought it was a fluke till on christmas eve with house full of guests, would not turn on no matter what I did. 5 pounds of calamari went uncooked. I did like the reservoir system. but the machine did not last and since I only fry 2-3 times a year, I had it too long to be returned. piece of junk"
2,Too large and leaks oil,"This fryer is very large in size, but the basket is pretty small. I would think for a fryer this size the basket would be deeper. Most of the space is taken up by the oil reserve tank below. The problem with this tank is that oil easily leaks and gets all over the counter top. I had an old Oster deep fryer and got rid of it to purchase this larger one. I am sad I got rid of it before getting this one, as it was a much better built fryer. This one is really flimsy. It doesn't feel solid at all. Things just aren't made like they used to be. Bummer... we were really hoping to like this and instead are going to return it."
5,Great fryer,"This fryer was worth the extra money. I have not had any problems with oil leaking like some of the other reviewers. I make sure the plug is in and the oil is cool before I turn it to drain. Only thing I would like to see different, is the lid does not attach, it just sits on it. When you take the lid off to check or stir the food, you have to be careful to keep it level or the condensation buildup on it drips/runs into the oil and splattering occurs. You will only do this once and then you remember. We've had it about 1 month now, have used it a couple times each week, I love it. The built in strainer and oil container are awesome ideas. Thank you. If you fry a lot, this is great."
3,Makes disconserting metal popping sound,"I have only used the thing twice and both times, after I cooked a few batches of fries and sweet potato fries, the metal made a loud pop, and then a couple more times. My girlfriend thought it was going to jump off the counter or something. We had just done our last batch so, I just unplugged it and the popping immediately stopped. Then we used the fryer the next day and after a couple batches, it did it again.Long story short, the loud popping noise it makes after cooking a few batches has scared my girlfriend away from wanting to use it...which is obviously not the desired outcome of making the purchase. I still like using it, but not sure why it makes that pop, perhaps the oil is getting too hot...Any deep fryer is going to be a pain in the butt to clean...but as far as deep fryers go, they made it about as easy as they could have..."
1,"Poor Design,Good Idea","I read the manual and set-up properly cooked very well allowed to cool 3hr plus, But when draining into the storage compartment the oil ran everywhere! I was standing there watching as I had read other reviews of this problem and made sure it was properly in place and still oil spilled over the counter and onto my floor WHAT A MESS! I thought about placing the fryer in a large baking pan just in case of leakage but thought it should be ok MY MISTAKE. For those who have this fryer and are happy thats great but something must be wrong somewhere for this many oil leaks maybe a defective valve I don't know but will not try again."
2,could have been a great fryer,"This fryer is everything I want in a frier. It holds quite of bit of oil so batch size is decent. Good temperature control and it heats up reasonably fast. The vent has a grease catcher but not a carbon filter though. The drainage system works great and makes cleanup a breeze. I typically re-use oil once before discarding it. Overall the unit is fantastic.Edit: a shame but after a year or so, this unit no longer heated to 375F. I had been getting batches of sogginess and sure enough, the temp was 300-320 max. Too bad, I like the oil recycling system.Question: why are deep fryers so unreliable nowadays???"
5,Used 5 times so far and it works better then I expected,This was a gift that I got to pick out and it's the coolest gift! My boyfriend and I love to cook and we have used this for serveral different recipes and there hasn't been a single problem.
1,not worth it,"received unit, followed direction, went to cook french fries at 370 degrees. Unit only went to 310 degrees. Sent heating unit to service center. replacement came. Only heats up to 350 degrees, not the 374 on the dial. The basket and container are not very deep. Not worth the money."
3,Spend a bit more,"I have been purchasing deep fryers for many many years. I have only and will only buy T-Fal fryers. In my opinion they are the best on the market. Great quality and last a long time. This is the first time I bought this model. The fryer comes with no bells and whistles when it comes to a timer and alert noises to let you know when the temperature has been reached. The ""ready light"" just goes off on its own with no signal. It is a small light that is not positioned in a good place for viewing. One of the first times I used this fryer, it was left on all night because the light is in a hard to see place. Not good for safety reasons. This fryer will be used as a secondary one as I need to repurchase an Emeril. The timer and temperature signal is a must and worth the extra money."
2,Not meant for Heavy Use,"I bought it as a gift for my husband. We do alot of cooking and wanted a good home deep fryer. It worked great, and everything we cooked came out great. We loved the EZ clean feature as well. However it broke after a month and a half. We used it, at least 2-3 times a week. It's fine if you maybe use it twice a month if that much."
5,Deepfryer-T-Fal,Not disappointed at all and very practical. I love the idea of being able to drain the oil without a mess. The items fried were not greasy at all because of the proper temperture.
2,It's a rip-off.,"What seemed like a promising collection of surf music turned out to be quite a disappointment. Terrible sound quality and bad mixes throughout. Jan & Dean, the Beach Boys, Wipe-Out by the Safaris and other recordings are mutilated."
2,Completely Useless For Me,"I wanted to connect a computer to a router, and the computer was going to be pretty far away from the router. So I figured I needed a long cord, and decided to get this one, which is supposed to be cat 5 stranded patch (which was what I needed.) Well, it's long. That's the only good thing about this cord. But the bad thing is so bad that the cord is useless. There is nothing on the ends! It's just a giant wire! There aren't any connectors on the ends that I can use to plug the cord into my computer, or the router. So I have a cord, but no connectors. It's completely useless, unless I buy the connectors separately, and attach them myself. Do I know how to do that? Do I want to do that? No. So I'm returning this. Maybe, if all you need is the cord (it's grey, by the way), and not the connectors, you might be able to use this. Otherwise, it's completely useless. If you can't find any cords this long that have connectors, maybe you should consider trying a shorter cord. ..."
5,A Child's Eye View of Everything,"As you read the pithy observations of Edith Ann, you have to imagine Lily Tomlin perched in the oversized rocking chair. I can hear her voice as Edith Ann says, ""My mom says I have to be more positive and I say life has to be more positive too or it's just not going to work.""You can't help but smile (and sometimes laugh out loud) as you read Edith Ann's comments about being a kid. Sometimes she gives her opinions on grown up issues too. Fun...Fun...FunThe book is 191 pages, but is a quick read with little sketches and plenty of white space. ""Growing up can take a lifetime,"" according to Edith Ann."
3,Ok...But not Great,"I am in school to become a registered veterinary technician so this book was a requirement for our Pharmacology class. The first three chapters in this book are absolute Gold as far as information goes but the rest is really lacking. Many of the common veterinary drugs covered in my class were not even in the book so I had to go elsewhere to find all the information I needed. Although the drugs that were covered were covered well and in a friendly layout, the drugs they didn't include really diminished the usability of this book. A real disappointment as far as textbooks go in my opinion."
2,Not for Late Windows,"I bought this game thinking that it would play using Windows Vista. Nope! Don't buy this game if you are thinking the same thing I was. Will play on Windows 2000 or earlier. I hear good things about Betrayal at Kondor. If you have a system that will support this game, than definitely try it out!"
2,"A nice book, but very limited in it's use with kids","This is a lovely book, and the author's photo/illustrations are a nice idea. Anyone purchasing this book should be aware that Russell is non-verbal, and stereotypical in his mannerisms and behavior. As a parent of a 4 year old autistic son, I wish there were a book that discussed issues such as perseveration and echolalia...both drive my six year old completely crazy!! I shared this book with him, and it didn't really offer him any insight. If you have an aloof, non-verbal child, this is a great book. If not, don't bother."
3,Don't get this as your first VBA book,"My aim was to get a structured introduction to the VBA programming in order to create macros that would be useful for my own specific needs. It was a little late when I realized that this book wouldn't do it. The introduction to VBA is okay, but then the author jumps from one topic to another without a logical structure. Although there are very good Macro examples in the book, they are for specific cases and cannot really be tailored to one's specific needs unless the reader already possesses some VBA knowledge."
3,Okay tutorial,"This book was not as completed as I'd hoped. It seemed to rely on examples and expansions of those examples, but none of them even approximated the application I need. It comes somewhat short as a reference book as well. It did contain enough to get me going, but most questions I had were answered by trial and error."
4,Received item quickly. Good seller.,Product does work well IF you use it properly. (It worked for us at a previous house; we will see if it works for us in our new house.) You have to position the screws in the proper location and it does take some trial and error.
1,Not snapping off,"I bought these to stop the squeaks in my 1940's San Francisco home. The screws does not snap off. Drilled several 3/32 pilot holes on my floors. The squeak no more screws keeps on spinning without snapping off.I emailed company (person), but have not got a reply back.Now I'm stuck with screws and a few holes on my floors.Items used:- Electrical Drill- 3/32 drill bit- Squeak No More between joist screws- Snap off fixture- Square head driver bit"
3,Crucial 2GB Kit (2 x 1GB) DDR PC3200 Unbuffered Non-ECC 184-Pin DIMM,"Easy to install and provides a large amount of memory. However, its installation and use did not make my computer run any faster, which disappointed me. It may be that some other factors need updating."
5,Correct Fit and the perfect price.,I got this memory for my Dell. It came quickly and popped right in. BIOS found it and we were off to the races.
3,IT RAN AT HALF THE SPEED,I am using 2 x 512mb ddr 333mhz and they run fast compared to these 2 x 1gb that only clocked 166mhz. however I am running a motherboard that supports PC2700 333mhz is the max speed. PC3200 runs at 400 mhz but is 184 pin and does fit the same socket. when PC3200 is used it should auto default to the highest speed. These did not do that they infact defaulted to less than half of that. This very well could be the product your looking for it just wasnt right fo my situation. Still waiting to hear back from the seller on the return and I understand there's a 15% restocking fee on all returns. If this is the case I will not be doing buisness with nemix in the future.
4,Much Better Than I Expected,"Don't let this game fly under your radar. It turned out to be much better than I was expecting when I bought it.Pros:-PHENOMENAL flying missions with a very fast-paced, ""arcadey"" feel and very tight controls-Great ""run-n'-gun"" action with various weapons-Multiple control schemes (Personally, I prefer #2)-Excellent FMV sequences between levels-Multiple difficulty levels-Fun multi-player modes with a lot of rule customization optionsCons:-The game is too short overall. Multiplayer and harder difficulty modes do help this, though.-You have to switch weapons on-the-fly; you can't do it from the pause menu-The controls of the Landmaster tank are slightly annoying until you get used to them."
3,Not the best fit,"I love the idea behind this product. I like to keep my medicine in their bottles and just take out what I need for the day during trips rather than taking out a weeks worth. The description of ""standard size bottles"" is a bit misleading. I was only able to fit the smallest of my medication bottles in the elastic straps. My other bottles (which is the size I usually receive from pharmacies)is unable to fit in the straps, and is too long for the case. This case would be perfect if it was made for a slightly larger bottle. If you buy this case it may be difficult to fit your bottles in at first; If you work it at it will probably fit in, but it is a bit difficult, however, it does hold them firmly in place."
5,"Same excellent taste, new look!","Title says it all. I drank the Good Earth China Black with peach citrus accents for a very long time. It was a favorite in my family year round. Then we could not find it any longer. I read the write on this Good Earth tea and it had all the same flavors as the older version in a newer box. Bought it, and loved it. More fruit accent, same rich black tea.It's the NEW favorite in the family from the 2 yr old to the pair of 50's.I highly recommend it to any tea drinker!"
5,A good thing that is hard to find.,"The tea delivered was not in the same package as shown, but I suspect this is due to a change by the supplier that Amazon did not know about. It is a wonderful tea consistent with the black teas that have made Good Earth great. At least in my part of the country (the southeast) it has become impossible to buy Good Earth Black Tea in the stores. This is a good tea. I subscribed to keep it coming."
3,Not what I expected.,"This video contains a handful of short stories. She watched it once, said she liked it, but has never asked for it again. And that was 3 months ago. When I asked her about it recently, she said, ""It's boring.""I think this would be a cute DVD for a younger child in the 3 year old age range. But definitely not for a 5 year old."
1,Not what I expected,"In the picture appears 2 chairs and a table. I bought thinking this is what I'll get, instead I got only 1 chair"
4,Ulum al Quran,A usefull guide to understand more about Holy Quran for English readers. while it is valuable for Muslims it is also a sort of informative for Non Muslims too.
4,An excellent sharpner that needs a few changes.,"This is perfect for chisels and narrow plane irons. The design makes it easy for someone with little skill on a grinder to get the angle just right.So what would I change?First,make the area where you insert the tool large enough to handle even the widest plane irons. I just saw an add for an add-on that allows you to sharpen wider tools for around $50. Kinda pricy for what should have been part of the tool in the first place.Second, sandpaper one grit more course for those tools that were really ground badly. Lastly for what they charge for sandpaper you think it's made of diamonds. Bring the price down to reality."
5,Great sharpener and a good value,"This sharpener has been very easy to use and perhaps the best value on the market. Its better for sharpening then a cheap bench grinder, and much more affordable then one of the higher end systems like the Tormek. For small blades and chisels this unit works great. I used to do my sharpening with waterstones and a Veritas MK II honing jig. While that method worked very well I often did not have the motivation or patience to do so. Using the woodsharp the process is much faster now and the results are the same. Unless you need to sharpening longer blades I wouldnt hesitate getting this system."
1,Save your money,"This unit was shipped with out all the parts,I received only the motor(2)glass plates and nothing more. I sent it back within 2 days."
3,Battery does not hold charge,"I got this watch as a gift. It last 1 year after which it stop holding its charge. I would leave it in the sun for 3 - 4 hours every day but it would only last 1 hour or so. If you press the light button, then you deplete the charge."
3,Casio Atomic Solar G Shock Watch,"Outstanding quality, and price. Bang for the buck! This watch makes the ideal work watch because it keeps accurate time and has a lifetime battery that does not need to be maintained. This is the best watch I have ever owned (Next to my Seiko)."
1,How far off can you get?,POint number 1...He says God can not be theistic because he is reffered to as a rock. This is completly destroying the idea of what the text is saying. He simply fit it to his own understanding without truly reading context. Rock is supposed to mean foundation. God is our Foundation!! This is not saying in any sort of way that he is nontheistic.Point 2.This is a new reliogion completly!!!
3,The Coffee and Doughnuts Will Be Excellent,"Spong spends a large part of WHY CHRISTIANITY MUST CHANGE OR DIE explaining in great detail about the death of theism and why this event will result in the collapse of mainline Christianity. His arguments are sometimes persuasive but when he starts to predict how the new Christianity will look after his second reformation, his ideas become less convincing. Spong describes in rather vague terms a new kind of worship and a different purpose for the future church.I have already visited too many churches that fitted his description and they did not seem to offer much in the way of spirituality. The coffee and doughnuts, however, were usually excellent."
5,An inspiring book - this is the good news indeed!,"I loved this book. I was brought up in the Episcopal Church, but have not attended church for years. When I have found myself in church over the years, I have felt, just as Bishop Spong describes, hypocritical and rather numb, saying words that do not, in truth, hold meaning for me, yet yearning to find a home for my own spirituality. Reading the Bishop's book, I find someone expressing, and supporting with scholarship, what I feel. I am inspired by the idea of God as the Ground of Being of which we all partake; of Jesus, not as unattainable perfection, but as the model for passionate expression of that Being, which is available to all of us. Clearing all the paths for its expression is the task, but it's there, and it's ours. This is the true message of the Gospels. This is truly the Good News."
1,Bowl of Gravel,"A bishop who ""exposes the Apostles Creed line by line"" can only be trying to seek text proofs for his contemporary views. As the author tries to discard ""outdated tenants"" for soon to be outdated current socio-political presuppositions, his protests are rather self-revelatory.Like a character in a play, with a gun to his head, he threatens to pull the trigger unless the group he purports to support embrace the demands of their enemies.This book will feed those who have a religious affiliation, but are in fact - secularists.A bowl of gravel."
5,Perfect bag for us.,"I've been on the hunt for the perfect diaper bag for over a year. This bag was a ""why not"" purchase, and I couldn't be happier with it. It has just enough space for everything we need (without being HUGE). My son still hasn't managed to hurt the fabric, and he's constantly chewing on it. All-in-all, we love it!"
4,Great ideas!,"This book has so many great ideas for kids with SPD--but really they would be helpful ideas for any kids. It's broken down into sections, so you can target the areas your child needs the most help in."
4,Out of Sync Child Has Fun,"This book brought understand and provided tools for me to use on our journey with our daughter. There is still alot of questions about supportive documentation regarding sensory supports, but we would never have achieved Functioning Recovery with out it. I used this book as a tool to provide sensory input into my sensory seeker while we were playing. It was easy to implement these supports because we were, ""playing."" Read our story...Coming Through the FogComing Through the Fog: A mother shares her journey of her daughter's recovery from Autism and Sensory Processing Disorder to Functioning Recovery and independent living while providing helpful tips"
2,Extremely frustrated,"I bought this for my boyfriend, and though at first it appears to be two real books, there's a problem.There was glue along the binding seam and this ruins the allusion.As I said, I bought this for my boyfriend. He is a 25 year old. The books I received were books about Oprah. The one on the front had a large picture of her face, and bright hot pink writing on the binding. These books won't exactly blend in on his bookshelves. I'm trying to return it but am having difficulties."
2,The first season set.,"The show was one of the elderly parent's favorite from 1960s USA television. I bought one collection each, of the first three seasons. The vendor (supplier to Amazon) for the DVD collections used cheap plastic cases for the DVDs, in which the plastic center post clips inside used to hold the DVD in place in the case, were so thin and brittle they broke almost immediately, requiring I buy new generic DVD cases from the local Radio Shack. The first season collection DVDs do not have an automatic ALL-PLAY setting, hence I have to be with the parent when this set plays in order to manually switch to the next episode each time an episode ends. DO NOT BUY FROM THIS VENDOR."
2,Anorexic sound,"Highly disappointing. I bought these to replace a pair of worn-out Grado SR-60 cans, and was immediately appalled by their brightness and lack of body. The much cheaper Grados were superior, as were Sennheiser's own 'entry-level' HD580.Before sending the HD555's back, I compared them to my super.fi 5Pro earphones (driven by a HeadRoom Total BitHead headphone amp) at work. If anything, the HD555's suffered even more by comparison.I ended up purchasing the Grado SR-80 headphones instead, and am fairly happy with those."
1,Are these Headphones or Speakers ??!!!,The sound quality is excellent. The headphones are very comfortable.But you should know that you won't be the only one listening to the music causethe sound leakage is something unbelievable !!!..I expected more from a this brand name but totally disappointed. RETURNED !!
5,GREAT INTRY LEVEL PRODUCT,"IF YOU DON'T ENJOY OUT OF THE BOX SOUND , TRY THE "" HEADROOM - AIRHEAD "" . IT'S A PORTABLE HEADPHONE AMPLIFIER . FOR UNDER $100. IT'S A GREAT UPGRADE. I HOOKED UP THE "" HD-555 "" TO MY COMPUTER HEADPHONE JACK . I TURNED THE VOL. TO THE LIMIT & THE "" HD-555 "" HELD TOGETHER WELL. I PUT THE HEADPHONES THROUGH A RADIO DEMO FOR CLIENTS NEEDING AUDIO PRESENTATION . THAT WAS EXCELLENT . LIKE HI-DEF MOVIES , THE SOURCE SEEM TO BE IMPORTANT TO BE PLEASED W./ RESULTS. I BOUGHT THE ""HD555"" FOR PRIVACY W./ MY SAMSUNG LCD HDTV , BLURAY , & HD DVD VIEWING & ENHANCED LISTENING EXPERIENCE. GOOD LUCK W./ YOUR EFFORTS."
1,How to annoy everyone around you!,"First off, these are comfortable headphones with great sound quality. BUT the open air design of the cans turns you into an unwitting boom box for everyone around you. People within 5 to 10 feet will hear everything you hear in an quite annoying way. If you're going to use these alone in a room or studio, then great. If you plan to use these at work or an airplane DO NOT BUY! Don't be that annoying idiot."
4,One problem,"Love the headphones I only have one problem with them and it's the cord. I was disappointed when I realized the cord was not removeable like the pair of HD485's I have, but I'll live with the great sound I get out of them."
4,Great headphone set,"HD 555 is very comfortable and of high quality. I received excellent customer service from amazon. The bass is decent and sound is crystal clear. After getting this set of headphones I could no longer listen to mp3s anymore - because I need to listen to lossless musics so that the potential of these headphones can be fully explored and experienced.The only thing that isnt very perfect is that it is not closed-designed. The sound tends to leak out of the cups, which makes the sound not very ""shocking"" compared to that of the closed-designed HD280 I have. Overall ,the sound quality is great, definitely recommended."
2,SENT THEM BACK?,I believe these are good quality and I've owned Senheiser headphones before but I had to send these back. I got a hissing vibration sound in my left ear only in gamers DVD and other movies. It was not the loud clicking sound that means you have the bass up to high. The vibration sound was intermittent and I felt like something was loose. The only option was to get a refund from Amazon. I took the option to have UPS pick them up and I paid nothing. TIP: If you want UPS to pickup you better have the box waiting outside your door or be ready to chase them or they will just leave you a label and run.
5,Great Headphones for the money!!!!,I have a friend who has the HD-595's and I really can't notice the difference. I paid roughly 100 dollars less then him although i like the look of the 595 better but these are so affordable. GREAT sound on my Sound blaster X-fi Xtreame Audio card crystal clear for under $100 the old ear buds i have FAIL in comparison.Edit: with a very slight mod of taking 2 pieces of black foam out these turn into HD-595s they even have the exact same sound drivers in them.
2,Disappointing,"The manufacturer Product Description said - Good attenuation of ambient noise, but the very first thing I noticed was the boost of the room noise when placed them over my ears. But the killer was that playing music through broadcast to the entire room - I might as well have been using I small speaker. Unfortunately that was unsatisfactory and they are already on their way back to Amazon."
2,Not for a quite small office.,"I purchased the 555s after using my sons 280 Pros assuming the 555s were the same but better.Good news is, they are amazingly comfortable and I'm sad to have to send them back.Bad news is, they leak sound like crazy. Not only can everyone hear what you are listening to but it does not block the incoming noise either.If you are in a small shared office trying to block out the ambiant noise and not bother your neighbor these are not the headphones for you.Side note: This was totally my fault, I only read the top reviews not thinking this might even be an issue since I'm headphone rookie."
5,"A great book! However, I have a question for readers","I've used the first edition of this book more than any other vocabulary reference and consider it my most important ally when trying to understand something, clarify my thinking, or (sometimes even more difficult) attempting to communicate an idea to someone else.Real communication can only result when the reader or listener receives the message you intended to convey. If communication is more important to you than merely moving your muscles and creating various sounds or finger movements for your own edification, then I predict it is highly likely that you also will come to treasure this book.Further, if you understand that using words rigorously is important for your own clear thinking, this book will likely become one of your ""bibles""!However, can anyone tell us what is different about this 2nd Edition? Or is it just another printing? Thanks!"
2,"If it's not for the price, I would give 1 star","ABOUT THE BOOK ITSELF1. The book I received is not the newest edition AT ALL2. The book is extremely old, printed before 20003. The quality is just acceptable.4. It bears strong odor, disgusting me when I flip the pages.ABOUT THE CONTENT1. I haven't read it yet, but I notice the pictures and texts are separate. Extremely inconvenient especially for an art book.2. This obsolete edition I received has 300 pages, definitely too long for students like me.Overall, I am not satisfied with it AT ALL."
1,Misrepresentation,"I normally always read the reviews on Amazon, before I purchase, and sure enough, the one time I didn't, I get bit.As others have said, this battery is very much misrepresented and the one you receive is not what you thought you ordered. The description very much implies you are getting an AT&T; battery, when in fact they are selling a cheap, generic that is supposed be useable in tons of different brand cordless phones.That would be fine, if that was what I had wanted to purchase, but I wanted a replacement battery that was identical to the one that came with my phone.I don't like being misled, when I purchase online, and eBatteries needs to change their product description. Will make me think twice before ordering anything from them again."
5,This is a riot,"This comic is hilarious. A lot of crazy stuff going on here, no wonder it's called Madtown Hospital, it makes a lot of sense. The name does the comic itself is just wacky."
5,An outstanding journey,"This book is a great testament to an innovative plane and the spirit of adventure that lurks inside many (all?) of us. Who wouldn't want to vicariously share in travels all over the globe and learn about faraway places? Yeah, there's the occasional factual or syntax error in the first printing that escaped the book's editor. But show me ANY other work as technically or artistically ambitious as this, that appeals to such a wide-ranging technical and non-technical audience, that doesn't have a shortcoming or two. The book inspires me to visit faraway places and celebrates the mystery and geekiness of flight. And that makes it great, in my opinion."
4,I like it...,"Over the years, when purging discs, I will strongly consider losing it. Today, I am glad that I always choose to keep it. It's very atmospheric and features a somewhat cheesy lineup, but the production is outstanding and the performances are very passionate. Your friends may not 'get it' but it has its time and place. Plus, once, when it was rather new and I lived in San Francisco, I had just heard the part where someone (martin sheen perhaps) says something about the earth shaking...and there was a small quake. This album has power."
1,Too good to be true - AVOID!,"These shoes are terrible. I read the reviews and took the risk anyway because the price was so good - too good to be true. My foot fits in fine, but my big toe (as another reviewer claimed) gets pinched even after a week of wear to break it in! Also, the ""leather"" start rubbing off within 10 hours of wear (1 day!) Other reviewers have claimed this as well! The shoe does truly look great out of the box, but a shoe that starts to get destroyed and is painful is not worth your money. Pay extra and get a shoe that is more comfortable and won't be ruined within a week.I bought a slightly more expensive Rockport and they are more comfortable and the leather does not just rub off! Do not buy this shoe.Bostonian is no longer a trustworthy shoe company. I urge you to look towards competitors like Johnston & Murphy and Rockport. Do not make the same mistake I did."
2,Shoes fell apart after the first use,"I was extremely disappointed after receiving my Bostonians. I wore them once and the ""leather"" began to peel away. Typically Bostonian are known for their quality and I've owned a pair before however these were really cheap. I wouldn't waste my time."
2,Not worth your money.,"I've worn these shoes 6 times since I've bought them and right now they look like I've worn them daily for a year. They're uncomfortable and have an absurd crease where my toes bend. I don't have to wear dress shoes often for work, but when I do I'm on my feet all day and these simply cant handle that. I'm doing nothing strenuous with them, just walking around. Avoid these shoes."
2,Defective product,"While I liked the shoes, a problem occurred which greatly diminished my enthusiasm for the shoes. It appears that the eyelets are punched too close to the edge of the flap and after a couple of months they ripped through. I bought 2 pair of these shoes and this occurred on both pair. I've never have had this happen before to me.What else can I say but that I wouldn't buy them again."
3,Too short,"I saw a program on this subject on the history channel and promptly went to pick up this book. I'm glad I got it from the library rather than buying it however. While the subject is fascinating and the writing quite nicely paced, the book absolutely fails to deliver the depth of analysis and information that I was hoping for. However, I can say that all of the information presented in the book seemed to be well supported."
5,Loved this book,"Again, Abraham did an excellent job of writing. I loved this book as well as his others. He is brilliant as a writer and compassionate as a doctor. This book opens one's eyes to the suffering of those and their loved ones who have endured the ravages of HIV infection."
5,Rose,This is an excellent book on the early HIV/AIDS Epidemic from the point of view of a foreign doctor in small town America. It is so moving and beautifully written. This is my second time of reading it after many years and it is still compelling. I highly recommend it
2,Beware this will rust quick,Purchased this item a year ago love the original look before it has fallen into the world of rust. Also the handle does not work well. No worth the money!
5,very informative and answered many questions,a short book that was entertaining and informative to read. I have referred to it several times sinceI finished reading it. Especially helpful since my ancestors were among the early proprietors of Delaware.
1,Awful and out of date,"Simply awful and out of date. I think it's unchanged since the 1950s. Many better books, the Alfred book is a simple place to start, otherwise Jim Beloff's bari song book. This shouldn't even be in print anymore. I can't imagine watching the DVD."
3,Fun With The Baritone Uke Book/CD Set,I was sent a DVD whicn I can not used instead of CD. On the Music Book it stated that is would be a CD. I would like a CD sent please.
5,great album,just what i expected from camiel like always laid back jazz or down tempo whatever you wanna call it it's just great chill you up.
1,Terrible and overpriced,"I am presently taking a Java course using this book and I cannot understand how anyone found that this book was well written or easy to understand. The author adds unnecessary elements to most of his examples, which confuses the reader, especially when the example is dealing with an abstract concept. I'm up to chapter 8 now and doing well in the course, despite the shortcomings of this book. At this point I find the book to be mediocre at best. I would definitely not recommend it to anyone, especially if you haven't had any programming experience. I'm sure there are better and CHEAPER books out there on Java."
4,Great dragon needs help from shirt...,"The item is worth it just for the dragon graphic alone - a traditional depiction full of energy, action, and mystery. Excellent line and detail rendition in the printed image, although I think the image should be larger as it appears on the shirt. Delicate- you'll want to wash this one carefully and keep the printed image out of the sun. The fantastic dragon image is carried on a dark field which contrasts too strongly against the stark white t-shirt, so the image doesn't ""read"" well from a distance. The shirt itself is a lighter fabric than what I prefer, but it is sewn well. Time will tell how well the garment holds up."
3,Better than your printer's reader,"After about four & a half years it died.But if you're considering a reader, get a reader! I bought this for a friend, who had no reader, now she has to use her printer (which is W A Y too sloooooooooow). I recommend anything from sandisk, the cards are still going after 4,000 photos & bazillions of transferred files (And we never lost a file--see Lexar reco). Multi readers/writers are out in abundance now, so look at them. Make sure it writes to the card, not just read it!"
3,"Very nice, but no match for a determined puppy","Overall this is a very nice gate. It looks great, is well built, and is easy to install. And while I like the look of the wood portion of the gate, it unfortunately is a bad idea for puppies or dogs of any age that like to chew or are determined to get out. Within three weeks my 4 month old Beagle had chewed and broke his way through it. So I had to replace it with a gate made solely of metal."
5,Beautiful product,"Baby gates don't hold a candle to this product. I thought I could skimp and pay about $30 for a baby gate to keep my dogs corralled. Well, the problem with that was that it was ugly and cumbersome to use.Enter the Richell One Touch. The ""white"" finish is actually a very off white, not true white. The exact color I wanted.This item looks really really nice. It's well crafted and you can tell. I don't notice it sometimes. It swings both ways which is really nice, too.The handle on top is plastic. Thick and strong plastic, but plastic. I removed the gate to paint, and my dog knocked it over, breaking the plastic handle. One quick call to Richell, and they sent out a replacement at no cost to me. Didn't ask how long I had owned the product or require proof of purchase. Just took my name and address and mailed out the replacement handle.I am looking forward to buying more of these! Great gate and great company."
4,Richell 94118 Richell One-Touch Adjustable Pet Gate with Wood Finish,Good gate and the wood finish looks well with house decor. Easy to use with one hand. A little hard to install in doorway and the piece at the bottom can cause a tripping hazard. Would be better if the bottom rail was lower profile or if the bottom was wider and angled on both sides as a ramp so that you don't trip over it. We have all hit our toes and tripped going through this door. You will trip or hit your foot if you do not go slow and raise your feet.
5,Love this gate,This gate is perfect for keeping my 3 dogs and cat out of the bedroom during the day I wish I could afford 2 more for each room instead of having to keep the doors closed. It is very attractive and very sturdy and a cinch to put up I have not had it very long and i hope the handle holds up through frequent use
2,A.J. Chewed Right Through It,My three month old collie chewed right through this gate. It's a beautiful gate but should have metal bars instead of rubberwood. Wouldn't recommend this one.
2,Loved it until our Maltese began chewing it,"We were very happy with this gate at first (our dog...not so much). Our 7 pound Maltese has discovered that the inside portion is chewable. I saw in previous reviews, before I purchased this gate, that other people had had this experience. Thinking that our dog is not much of a chewer, we thought it would be OK, so we ordered it. It took him about 6 weeks to discover that the inside bars can be chewed. I don't understand why the sides are metal, but the central panel is not.On the plus side, it latches fairly easily, and was easy to install. Before it became a ""home improvement"" project for our dog, it looked nice. If the company changed the design, to make the gate all metal, I would purchase that product. I like the color, and since we have the gate in a central location, this matters. If Richell can make the sides and bottom in this nice metal color, why not the central panel?For now, we're using a baby gate we got at Babies 'R Us."
5,Best Gate Available,"Between basset hounds and babies we have had too many pet/baby gates to count. Not only was this gate easy to install, but it is also incredibly sturdy. This gate has been working marvelously for over a year and we are now replacing all of our pet gates with this model. This is definitely the gate to have!"
4,Very comfortable and great sound,"this are my first on-ear headphones and i'm loving them, they are very comfortable to wear and they have very good sound quality, they play 320 kbps amazingly... you absolutely get what you pay for, of course there are better headphones than these, but at this price range you can't get any better."
4,Sennheiser HD 515 Headphones,Have had these headphones for about a few weeks so I can speak much on long term durablity but out of the box they are great! Very comfortable and sound great but I am no audiophile. For the price good value so far. Just remember these are open end ear phones so if you want these for the office or other places where you dont want people to hear what you do then go with a closed ear head set.
4,great product,"I was using a inexpensive set of sony one the ear that I was pretty happy with for the price about 21.00 a wallmart but i knew a good set of head phones were needed .Mainly i had used head phones for a sony mp3 player and to watch movies hooked up to a pioneer 1020 reciver as to not bother other members of the household late or very early in the morning.These made my mp 3 player sound somewhat better but when hooked to the reciver you could hear a real improvement,not just for music but movies as well.im sure you can spend a great deal more but for most people these will do the job.I look at them as kind of a best buy for the money and what you get."
4,Great Headphones!,"Buy it! You won't regret it. These headphones sound incredibly! They might not be professionals, but sound like it. They are confortable and really light weight. Cable cord is long enough for you plug it in wherever you like and move around. It's a great choice."
5,Great for the price,"Great headphones! great for music ,movies and playing games on the pc.the sound is very good for the money. heard the HD-555 don't think the extra 30$ is worth adding.i have these for little over 2 months now, the Hd-515 are very very comfortable for hours on your head,surprising is the fact that you can put this on even if you have glasses! you don't feel any pressure on the ears and in the area.great buy and i recommend this headphones for those who want high quality sound in this price range,i did a fair amount of listening tests and the headphones that are better than these cost a lot more and usually need an amp for proper listening."
5,"Great value, great sound.","I bought these as a replacement for my far inferior Koss UR29 headphones. All I can say is I'm very glad I did.For both music and movies, these headphones are excellent, especially for the price. I did have to tweak some of my EQ settings on my stereo, but that goes with every set of headphones or speakers.Nice ten foot straight cord.About the only drawback of these 'phones from a consumer perspective is that the plug is a 1/4"" plug with a 1/8"" plug adaptor. This can lead to a fair amount of stress on either the plug itself or the jack in which it is inserted. An easy fix would be to get a corded adaptor as opposed to the solid one that's included. Sennheiser has these available on their site for about nine bucks, which I personally think is rather steep. I would think one could fine one online somewhere else for much less.Overall an excellent investment!"
5,Indispensible for car travelers,"Anyone who has ever traveled across state or county lines, needs a copy of Essential Radio. Perfect companion to go along with the road map and flashlight in the glove compartment. I definitely recommend it."
3,OK,I wasn't overly impressed with the product. The light has to be just right to get a reflection and due to the size and color the reflection isn't that great. I does work for me. I put it on my truck's black door handlein an inconspicuous way and when I am on the side of the road they shine up a bit at night making the handle easier to grab.
3,A interesting ride thru florida,"The characters in the book were a bit dull. But I had no problem remembering who was who. THe plot was good and the alibi was better. I thought the fact that the main charater as a regular shmo was interesting gimmick and also the fact that the book outlines the ways for a person to find out about things without having to be more than an amateur.The only time it lacked is that literally three quarters of the way in it said. ""The case was solved."" And my mind basically went into. ""skim"" mode thru the information about how it was solved. In other words. It lost it's inertia three-quarters of the way in.I would not mind reading more books by this author in the future though."
2,Weak like all LED nightlights,"The light is extremely weak, like all LED nightlights. If you want to light a larger area, (such as giving a soft glow to an entire bathroom sized room) you need to use a good-old fashioned incandescent nightlight."
4,go for it!,"Bought for a big Marvel fan who specifically requested it.He loved it, apparently very interesting (though I did not read it personally)Good packaging & shipping"
3,overpriced,These are screws that are available almost everwhere else at a much lower cost . I guess that your are paying for them being black.. A steel screw would hold rack mounted equipment just as well for a lot less
5,Wedding Day,"I wanted a focal point for my daughters garden wedding. The Arbor is a beautiful color and blends so well in the landscape that it looked as though it has been there for years. It gave us a structure to have the wedding in front of, but didn't upstage the bride and groom. It was easy to put together and install. It is well made and really sturdy. I agonized over my choice and ended up getting just what I envisioned. It will be a lasting memory of the wedding in the garden."
2,Waste of money,"My money would of been better spent on a a ""real"" camera. I could not tell how many photos were taken. Could not tell if the photos was focused. The dial just kept turning. Waste of money!"
5,Highly recommended for soon-to-be test takers.,"Pros:An excellent preparatory guide for those studying to take the Graduate Reentrance Exam. Reflecting now--after taking the ""old"" GRE CAT (Computer Adaptive Test)--I'm pleased that the book covered all major topics present in the exam via both thorough explanatory passages and ample practice problems.Cons:The electronic version lacks links in the problem/solution sections, which proves irritating and distracting as you cannot quickly ""thumb"" back and forth between problem and solution pages. Secondly, the rendering of some problem/solution content is.. funky. The intended presentation is usually clear, but nevertheless distracting.Overall: Great value purchase with drawbacks common to most electronic conversions. Highly recommended for soon-to-be test takers looking for an electronic copy of a respectable study aid."
3,"It's big, and that's what I needed","I got a mediocre score, well pretty good score, on the GRE, but I wanted a better one so I bought this book (and another one the ""LSAT / GRE Analytic Workout"" by Karen Lurie, since my worst area was the analytic section). The book is full of faults:some wrong answersan annoying tendency to seem to be expression the authors' social and religious veiwpointsand many badly formed questions (amiguous verbal questions, nonpresice math questions, badly conceived and explained analytic puzzles and arguements)I was frequently annoyed by these faults. But there were lots of practice problems, which is exactly what I needed. When I was taking the test the second time, I could see right through it. ""This is the goal of this question."" ""This is where they're trying to trick me."" I got an 800 800 800 on my retake, so stuff worked. That's why the book didn't get less than three stars. I'm not convinced that any other big fat book wouldn't have done just as well."
2,Not the best and not good,"While the practice questions are helpful, the practice tests are slipshod. The interface doesn't really simulate how the CAT test is presented (no confirm button for selecting an answer, you can go back to questions, etc.). The questions are not adaptive. There is no clear and easy way to go back and review questions you got wrong and read explanations for the correct answer. In fact I haven't figured out a way yet. Several questions from the practice drills are also in the test. Bottom line, this is not a good book for practice tests."
3,needs some refinement,"I skate on racing skates in the warm months for fitness, so I thought this product would be great for indoor cold weather training. The slide and booties work well. The problem that I've found is that when you push-off on the end pads, they have a tendency to raise up, so that your foot slides under the end pad, and that is not very comfortable. The manufacturer needs to find a better way to secure the end pads. I am going to have to glue and bolt down the end pads. Other than that one issue, the product works as advertised. Really helps to spray furniture polish on the mat too."
5,does not deserve to be forgotten.,"I must turn to those stupid descriptions I always use: Helstar sounds like 80s thrash combined with early Queensryche (like, EP-ish early), Death, and...Symphony X! at least in the guitar department. The guitars are replete with 'neoclassical' flourishes and fancy riffcraft that evoke the second and third bands, and the vocal style of 'Ryche. Songs are very meaty, chuggy, and driving! Progressive features are omnipresent -- with all its rhythmic twists and sophisticated melodic contour, you can see that Helstar is an unacknowledged champion of proto-prog-metal. the production is a little dated, and the drums sound pretty bad, but this is killer. Hunt it down!"
2,Dali's Mustache,The content of the book wasn't nearly as cool as the cover. I don't know that I would purchase it if I had it to do over.
1,Bootleg,This headband is 100% bootleg. Official Naruto headband are manufactured by Great Eastern Entertainment and comes with official Naruto tags which shows license owner logos. Buy at your own risk.
1,Not A Good Choice,"I spent ten dollars on the book and when i got to my hotel room in NYC, i was so dissapointed. It had such untrue junk in it. Any true fan would know that the facts were not correct."
5,Alan Dunn fan!,"I'm a great Alan Dunn fan, as his books never disappoint. Not only is he a great demonstrator, his books (this one is no exception) provide superb step-by-step instructions with great illustrations. Whether I'm looking for inspiration on design, or how-to instructions, I turn to one of two authors - Alan Dunn is one of them. I like the way he structures his books logically. This one covers the subject of orchids, and it's the logical place to look if you want to know how to construct just about any variety you can think of!"
3,"Visually stunning, but not much useful content","Not surprisingly this book takes a visual approach to explain information architecture. The layout and design of the book is superb and there are lots of nice visuals that diagram information architecture processes. Unfortunately, there's not much to be said about the actual content of this book. I found it to be too simplistic with generalizations about the obvious (e.g. design for your users, not the business experts or developers creating the site). This book is for beginners with no background in IA or design. Try Information Architecture by Louis Rosenfeld and Peter Morville for a comprehensive overview of what IA is about--it's not as pretty though."
4,Love in a Blue time,"Provocative stories.-Well written.-We can a understand some of the problems that the middle age couples have to face in a post tacherisim era in London.-Kureishi goes deep in a world of confussion, individualisim and lack of compromise.-"
3,Their weakest album but it's a good late 70's rock album,"Of all the Starz albums that I own I would say that this is my least favorite album but it does contain some classic songs like X-Ray Spex, Good Ale We Seek, Hold on to the Night and the 7 minute epic Johnny All Alone, at first when I listened to this album I remember feeling really dissapointed by it and it almost made me gave up on them, fortunately I decided to check and see how good the Coliseum Rock album and I thought that it was a great album, it made me become a bigger fan of them and I went out to buy their first two albums.I think that Starz should've been as big as KISS, Aerosmith, Ted Nugent and Cheap Trick."
2,Too Small,"I was very disappointed in the size, was way too small for the area that I wanted to put it in and flimsy. Always look at the sizes before ordering."
2,I was hoping for something better...,"Whenever you hear the name Hogan, you certainly are expecting greatness as Mr. Hogan himself set the standards higher than anyone else in the world of golf. This book falls far short of Mr. Hogan's standard. I have been in the golf industry for over 20 years and around instruction for 15 of those, and for beginner or expect alike one would be better off looking for a book that is as easy to use and follow, as Hogan's classic and still standard, Five Lessons."
5,It Works!!,"If anyone wants to see how good this Daily Fiber product, follow this advice. Take 2 Capsules one hour before either your Lunch or Dinner, which ever meal is more predictable when you'll have that Meal.Do that for one week, & assess the results. If as I believe most people will find, vastly improved Bowel Movements after a week, continue with 2 Capsules, & don't bother increasing the Dosage, unless you feel you are still somewhat 'Clogged-up'.If it is 'Working' keep it at 2 Capsules, but remember - 'With a full Glass of Water'.This in my opinion is the Best Fiber Product on the Market today, by a stretch."
3,"I like it, but","I like this book. It's not the greatest, but it's not bad. If you're starting out painting and need some basic guidance for general skin colors it's probably ok. Where it's lacking is in most anything beyond the basic color of skin. There's no discussion of skin color in shadow, in the halftones where the skin turns away from the light, or where the skin blends into the hairline. Little about the affect of light, surroundings, or location (cheek, chin, forehead, etc.) on skin color either. Those things make or break portraits and some (me) just can't seem to mix the right colors to go with the basic skin tone of the model. I wish that had been addressed in this book... that would make it worth 5 stars (and maybe what people are asking for it these days)."
3,Astrology and Christianity?,"I feel some of the references can be misleading. There is no sure way to find how Abram might have found God. The book is interresting, but causes the reader to infer alot more that I am comfortable with at this point. I may change my mind when the rest of the story is published."
2,Abram,I did not care for the authors writing style in this book. I felt the book was so weighted down with ritual and historical fact that the story itself got lost. It appears that the author would have had a great story if some of the historical fact had not been in the way.
5,Sigma 28-135 Macro Lens,"I've always been an OEM kind of consumer, so buying a Sigma lens for my Nikon D80 was very unusual for me. I read a review about the lens on Amazon and thought I would make the purchase. The price was right and I always wanted a Macro lens for my close up shots of cactus and flowers. I am very pleased with the results. It's taken a couple of hundred shots to get used to what to look for but in the digital world that is nothing. I highly recommend this lens and for those who are skeptical about non brand names, it's worth the adventure."
2,you get what you pay for.,"Cheaply constructed and uncomfortable. My head is not abnormally large, but the head band barely expands far enough to get around my gourd. Sound quality is acceptable and microphone seems to work alright. Wish I would have spent a little more and got something better."
3,Good for Skyping,"Good quality for Skyping. A little bassy for audio listening, but fine for a phone conversation. The audio cords are a little short, but sufficient."
3,SHOULD HAVE BEEN MORE COLORFUL,"I HAVE TWO OF MEEHAN'S BOOKS, ""CELTIC ALPHABETS"" AND ""ILLUMINATED LETTERS"" AS WITH ILLUMINATED LETTERS, I WAS DISAPPOINTED AT THE LACK OF COLLOR IN CELTIC ALPHABETS. THERE IS SOME COLOR: BLACK AND ORANGE OF ALL COLORS! ALTHOUGH IN THIS BOOK, THERE ARE 16 ALPHABETS, I WOULD HAVE BEEN PLEASED TO SEE THEM ILLUMINATED LIKE THE CELTS MEANT THEM TO BE: BEUTIFULLY AN RICHLY COLORED."
1,DJ Stage,"I purchased this product from DJ Stage on Amazon.com. When I received this item, the package looked like it had been around the world a half dozen times. The ink cartrige I received expired in Sep 2005! Yes the cartridge I received was 5 YEARS OUTDATED! I tried to contact the seller, but got no response. Since Amazon also gets these emails, I should have got a response from somebody. Don't know that I even want to use Amazon.com if they allow sellers like this who are ripping people off."
1,HomeVideo,"This video was not worth the money I paid for it. This video should be in the everything is ONE DOLLAR-BIN. Sorry, but this is one of those - I am going to the Festival let me video this and sell it on BLACK MARKET DEAL. This recording was not professionaly recorded They should have seeked a Professional - Then we could say ok. I am speaking only of the VIDEO not the FESTIVAL... Please DO NOT DO THIS AGAIN"
2,Short story unbelievable,"I do like reading Patterson but this had very little thought put into it, like he's producing stories like Danielle Steel. It's little more than a short story with 2-page chapters with interesting who-done-characters but very unbelievable. Sorry, guys."
5,A great thriller full of twists,"Patterson creates a character who is very likeable and his relationship with Ellie is very likeable and believable. This is one with twists to the VERY end, and I very much liked the ending. One of Patterson's best in my opinion."
4,Great read,"I enjoy reading James Patterson's books, and this one was no different. I highly recommend it."
3,Page-Turner,"This book, I've heard, is really similar to all his other books. I haven't read them, I have only read this one. This book is a murder, mystery, robbery book. It follows the main character from his job and a love affair to his run from the law. One of the main connections that I saw with is was Law & Order. This book followed the same theme of this popular show. It all starts with murder, the cops think it is one person, when really it is the person that seems the most helpful. I would still recommend this book, because it is a great book."
5,LIFEGUARD,EXCELLENT CONDITION...BRAND NEW...LIGHTENING DELIVERY...SMOOTH AS MOLASSAS TRANSACTION!! FORGET ABOUT BOOK CLUBS AMAZON IS THE WAY TO GO!
1,So Very Bad,It is a good thing that I bought this book from the bargain bin. I cannot tell you how poorly written and predictable the plot is. Ned Kelly may be the most stupid thief protagonist in history. Only followed by the drones in the police and FBI that try and catch him. The story is barely believable to the point where you think that the characters are so poorly drawn that you want to throw the book away. Right down to the by the numbers ending. Why would an FBI agent want to be linked and marry a felon anyway?
4,A Fun Read,"Once I started reading this book it was hard to put down. I almost finished it in one day, but life interrupted and I finished it in two. I have to agree with others that this is not Mr Patterson's best, but as stated before, it was a fun read. Ned Kelly came through all right...just as I hoped."
2,Made for TV?,"Mildly entertaining, light reading and totally unrealistic. I kept picturing it as a cheesy, campy, made for TV movie. This is not a book I would recommend, but it would do to entertain if you were trapped in an airtport."
3,A easy read but not just the best,"Ned Kelly is a interesting lifeguard. He has a criminal background in a record and a family, friends that practice the same profession and he becomes entangled with a female FBI agent in a love truss. A little over the ridge but somewhat beleivable. Then he ends up rewarded for a life of small time crime. I guess it will happen at times. Just a fair read in my opionion but lets not forget all the great novels he wrote by himself. I do find it seems to be fasionable now to sponsor a new writer and I beleive this is what we have here. Well James, think up a new one and do it on your own, make your fans happy again."
2,Hideaway,Koontz has gone to a lower level. The gore and explicit detail of death took away from the story plot and became the topic of focus. Not his best work.
4,COT BookClub Review II,"James Patterson's Lifeguard is an intruiging fast read book. My friends and I all read the book in less than three days. The setting of the book is the lush beaches of Florida where a beach bum transplanted from the East Coast turns his uneventful life into a story straight out of a tabloid. The story is pretty unbelievable and it is hard to believe a former street wise punk can allude hired assasins and the government authorities. We would recommend this book if you where stranded somewhere waiting for a flight or a train. It will help you pass the time but will not challenge your mind. Almost like reading a movie. We hope you find our reviews to be helpful. Our next book is ""THE HADES FACTOR"" by Robert Ludlum. Until next time, COT!!!"
5,WATCH THE MOVIE AGAIN LATER,This is a delightful story based on the book that is true. You meet people from two cultures that never meet in person but become close and kind friends. It is a feel good movie along with many comedic touches.
2,Ugh,"Spurred on by the reviews here, I tried it. Anne Bancroft acts SO badly in this flick, it's a wonder her mannered accent and in-your-face New Yawker shtick hasn't been roundly panned."
1,Four more stars when you give us the whole picture!,"Would you take seriously a bookshop with one bookcase in the middle of the room, but none on the side walls? What is wrong with Columbia, hacking off the side bookshelves by turning this gentle, Cinemascope masterpiece into a narrowscreen format? Get it right, people, and I'll buy it!STOP PRESS!!! The Australian (Region 4) version appeared in November 2003 and - guess what - it's widescreen! Wonderful movie, great transfer, no blinkers required!"
5,From airmail to email - the correspondence continues,"I was lucky enough to meet Helene Hanff in November 1994, just over three years before she died - the real-life star of this film. She was every bit as remarkable and likeable as she is portrayed in this film version which covers her corespondence with a London bookstore from 1949 to 1969.Anne Bancroft and Anthony Hopkins do a wonderful job in bringing this small-time story to the big screen.If you're interested in finding out more about Helene Hanff you can use a web search engine - this may well point you in the direction of my site devoted to Helene, her life and her books. Enjoy!"
5,Such An Interesting Movie,I saw this movie on Netflix and loved it. It's an interesting story and the characterizations are spot on. My daughter teaches literature and composition so I bought the video and the book upon which the movie is based and will send them to her soon. I just know she'll enjoy them also.
5,Buy this & watch it!,One of the most moving stories ever written! Beautiful movie with 2 of my favorites! Anne in NYC reminds me of me in NYC saying & doing things I say and do! This is the gift I gift to my literate friends!!!!
5,vcr of 84 Charing Cross Road,I purchased this vcr since I wanted the cast in the vcr rather than the one on the dvd. My cousin introduced me to the book many years ago and it is a favorite.
4,Gorgeous book with lovely rhymes and enchanting pictures,I would definitely recommend this if you're looking for a great book about beach-life - [...]
2,"Too much ""GREAT CREATOR"" and ""GOD"" in the book....","Found this book at Goodwill. I believe everybody is really an artist in some particular way. I will say that she is right to notice her world, write her morning pages and take walks. This is the very essence of sparking creativity. But, I was worn to the nubs by her constant GREAT CREATOR and GOD viewpoints. Way overboard. Also, this book read like a textbook from AA. That gets rather OLD, too. There were some good points in this book, and she's not a bad writer - but OVERBOARD on the above mentioned points in my estimation....."
4,Wake up USA,"I'm an American expat living in Australia and cannot believe these guys aren't getting any airplay in the US. His first CD had 3-4 top 10 Aussie hits that I would stack up against any of the hits that topped the US charts in 2005. This CD is by far their best effort - not a bad song on it. Similar to Coldplay's X&Y, it grows on you the more you listen."
5,Swanson is great,"I like Swanson's products, they seem to be consistently high quality. I recommend this to folks rather than using osmotic or stimulant laxatives, as cascara actually ""tones"" the muscles of the intestinal tract."
1,A lost treasure,"I have loved this record from the first time I heard it and was so excited to see it available on Amazon, I only have the vinyl and don't have a turn table set up. A treat for all fans of R&B/Rock/Gospel. So strange to me this recording never caught the public's attention in the USA."
5,Very nice!,"I use this book on daily basis and I couldn't be more satisfied with it. Idioms are so common in speech and writing in today's English, that you really don't stand a chance of speaking or understanding the language properly if you don't get familiar with its idiomatic expression. I recommend that you buy this book together with ""Dictionary of American Slang and Colloquial Expressions"" and read a few pages of both every day (you don't have to do it in alphabetic order, of course). Do it whenever you have 10 or 20 minutes off. The effect of the time you dedicate to this activity will amaze you. That's all what it takes to transform you into a great English languge speaker. The book is packed with many practical examples that you can start using straight away."
5,Essential must have thrash...,"This CD in my mind was by far SR's best. This CD is right along side Master of Puppets, Reign in Blood, Practice what you Preach, Thrash Zone, Lights, Camera...Revolution, etc etc. It's simply a must have.Yes, they slowed down their pace on this CD, but honestly...that's why this is so good. It has so much groove it reminds me of Lights, Camera, Revolution by Suicidal Tendencies. Song after song just hook you in with ultra catchy riffs, and vocals that you will be singing along to in no time. Pretty much every song is awesome...and when it's all in the same CD, you just have to buy it.American Way has the same riff repeated over and over, but it never gets old - like Pantera's ""walk"". Plus it's still heavy as hell.Anyway...if you check out my reviews, I don't give out 5 stars a lot, but this one deserves it and then some. My only complaint is that SR abandoned this sound to go for more speed in the future. Why?????"
1,Should be called the Bird Proof Squirrel Feeder,Bought this on Friday returned it on Monday. Save your money this is a total waste of space. The only birds that were able to get any food were grackels and an occassional house fince. The squirrel found the metal cage a wonderful thing with many sturdy places to hang on to while he dined on seeds from the bottom feeder tray.
1,Squirrel Proof - NOT,"Opus, Fortress Squirrel Proof Bird FeederFortress Bird FeederFor an expensive bird feeder, this one did not live up to its claims. Squirrels find it easy to get at. Also, the bottom stays wet and the seed sticks together and rots making it impossible for the birds to get at the seed from the lower stations. It is necessary to take it apart all the time to clean up the clogged and moldy mess. I am very disappointed."
3,"How to ""squirrel proof"" your squirrel proof birdfeeder","I got one of these at the local W store for less than 20 bucks. For that price, and with the following fix it does a good job of decreasing the amount of seed eaten by the rodent members of our backyard.I simply used some Gorilla tape (like duct tape only stronger) to tape over the bottom holes. This prevented the squirrels from shaking feeder and getting seeds to drop into the bottom tray (they can get a few, but not worth the effort). However, that makes it so that the bottom third of the feeder does not dispense food. The birds will stick their heads into the middle holes and get some of the food out, however.If you do not want to spend a lot on a really squirrel proof feeder this will cut down a lot on the seed swiped."
5,My Second Mantis TIller,"My current Mantis Tiller is almost 20 years old and still kicking. I just gave it to my sister so I could buy a new one. Don't be fooled by other less expensive mini tillers, the secret to the Mantis is pure power and the tines, they will chew through just about anything! If you buy from [...] they offer a 1 yr money back guarantee (the one negative reviewer didn't understand you have to order from them directly I guess?) but when you order from Amazon you get the free kickstand which is very handy bonus."
3,Mantis 2 stroke tiller,The tiller with edger and kick stand performs as advertised except the edger does not work. One should be careful to follow the assembly instrucitons carefully or assembley will be more difficult and take longer.
5,Best Little Buy,"Before reviewing the unit, I want to thank Amazon for such a quick handling of my order. I had it the next day!! The tiller works great.Plus it came with a stand and the cultivator! My wife is now happy that her garden was ready for this years planting season."
3,Capable tiller with design flaw,"Let me start by saying that I am impressed with the overall performance of this compact tiller, and others who have less rocky soil conditions may not experience the same issues as I have had.The On/Off switch for the tiller is on the hand side of the grip. When you hit a large rock while operating, the tiller tends to lunge back toward you, turning the switch off. After many frustrating restarts, you learn to keep a rigid grip, which leaves your hands and arms fatigued and tingling after a short session. That said my soil conditions are excessively rocky, so this may not be an issue for the rest of you."
5,Mantis tiller and attachment,"Incredible piece of machinery. Worked fantastic on about 1000 sq feet of hard, root and rock infested land. Light but man this thing is a bull. Get weed reducers. Roots did get wrapped around the tillers, but only cleared them out every 300 sq feet or so because I wanted to not because I need to. Only took 2-3 minutes to clear. Kick stand is also a must have. Also purchased the Thatcher and aerator attachments. Also did a fantastic job. Boy did the Thatcher bring out the dead grass. Make a bigger job than what I thought, so leave yourself enough time. Only problem with the tiller is that the on/off switch is too close to the right thumb area so you accidentally shut off the unit a lot. To prevent this, I taped the switch to the on position. There is little chance that the machine will be running and you getting your body stuck in it unless you do something stupid. In closing I highly recommend this product and all its attachments."
1,Disappointing,"I've had the gas cultivator for 4 years. The first year it worked great. The second year I had to take it into the repair shop. It worked for a few days then stopped. After that, each year I have had to have it cleaned/repaired. If you are skilled in small engine upkeep you might be able to keep it going. I loved it when it was new. I am now purchasing the electric version. Hopefully it will start and run on a regular basis."
5,One of the best early Power Metal albums,"I bought this album when it came out in 1984 and I still cherish it to this day. Those were the times of the Speed Metal craze - Thrash wasn't yet that defined (""Kill'em All"" was rather recent then) and most of us who were searching for harder and faster stuff were listening to these kind of bands, that played something similar to the NWOBHM but in a more powerful and aggressive way. As a reference point, Judas Priest may be the main influence here, but Torch really managed to create their own sound. Plus, the playing is tight and the production is killer. You may file it next to Jag Panzer's ""Ample Destruction"". Oh, and by the way, try to get it in vinyl..."
5,Destination Inspiration,"I just keep coming back to this book again and again--I've probably read certain chapters half a dozen times. Rolf's book is funny, well written, practical, inspiring. It is to a traveler what a great cookbook is to a chef--he assumes you have the inclination to travel, and he's not going to teach you how, per se, but he gives you the basic instructions to get the task done, and he makes you hungry for it. I highly recommend this book to everyone from conflicted couch potatoes to globe-trotting gypsies."
3,Nothing Too Surprising..,"The book is fairly common sense.. the general idea is be open to things and not rush the experience. The book does have a few good links to websites, but chances are if you've been researching enough on your own you've probably ran into a good amount of the suggested websites in the book. I found the random quotes throughout the book distracting and not really that inspiring. Overall I'd say get the book if you haven't done much research on the topic otherwise I'd pass."
4,Inspirational,"If you are planning to go on a long trip with a rucksack on your back, you might find lots of precious hints in this easy readable book. If you are an experienced traveller, you will share many feelings with Potts."
2,Disappointing,"I had great expectations from Potts having read his columns frequently. When I purchased the book, I was gravely disappointed by the overabundance of quotes, which, I suspect, were used to fill space, to make more pages to fill a possible page quota, and to allow Potts to write less.On a redeeming note, Potts does slather the entire book with many websites and sources for further information. When I first heard of the book, I did not expect it to answer all my questions or help me to plan completely my upcoming trip; I expected it to be a general guide. In that vein, I was not disappointed.After having read the book, I immediately sold it."
2,MORE OF A PHILOSOPHICAL APPROACH,"Doesn't really focus on practical information. A whole lot of 'the essence' of vaganbonding kinda stuff here peppered with personal anecdotes that sometimes come off a little self-serving. Not bad, jusr wasn't what I expected."
5,"Enjoy the journey, pack light and feel the time flowing.","When you enjoy travelling, you don't care about things and stuff that you can buy or bring back home. All that matters is what you bring inside your heart.This book is somehow trying to bring this subject in life as bring the same subject to how you travel.The more light and easy going you live your life, more you enjoy it. Same as the sense of joy of travelling without worries."
1,"Don't waste your time buying, The Check is not in the Mail","I purchased this book for my dental practice and found that it was a waste of time and effort. The reading was dull and uninformative. I had the feeling that this author was not in tune with the times. The information was stale, and boring. My financial director found a better book that has controlled our delinquent accounts receivable,entitled COLLECT YOUR MONEY. Now this book is worth its weight in gold."
2,GGW On tour #7,"It didn't have what I'm looking for. Mainly Girls going solo doing themselves and girls doing each other. Its all flash, interview and kiss and giggles with everything above the waist. If thats your bag you will probably get along good with it."
2,"ugly book, but a great book for science","it was really, really used. i wouldn't charge anyone for that book. but my granddaughter needed it for science projects at school.I would recommend it in better condition."
3,hippocrene practical dictionary gealic-english,"This dictionnary is very easy to ""browse through"" it contains most usual, common words... everyday use words.... but it lacks on certain aspect... if you are expecting some expressions, and pronounciation, you'll be dissapointed... But if your looking for a good, cute little pocket english-gealic gaelic-english dictionnary.. this is the book to buy.."
3,"Not bad, but not the best dictionary.",This is a nice little dictionary for looking up the common Gaelic words.However if you are looking for phrases to help get you buy in the Gaelic areas then this isn't the dictionary for you.
3,Misinformed...,"The Sennheiser HD-595 is a a great headphone judging it solely on sound. The problem with this headphone is it is 'open'. An open headphone has incredibly loud sound leak. Unless you want everyone around you to clearly hear what you listen to, you need a 'closed' or 'sealed' headphone.I honestly feel these should have a warning. It is unfair to expect consumers to expect a headphone to be as loud as a set of speakers in a room."
2,Amazingly Poor Choice for Office Listening,"I picked up this pair of headphones thinking that they would make excellent headphones for listening to my music at work.Unfortunately, they're open headphones, which leak sound (by design). They're so loud, my co-workers 25 feet away could clearly tell what I was listening to, which is fine for classic rock, but not so much for 90's era gangster rap.While I'm certainly appreciative of the effort to make great sounding headphones, headphones have traditionally been designed for personal listening, so as not to annoy others. I don't believe that Sennheiser should call these headphones as they are more precisely on-ear speakers. That is the reason for my low rating. I understand caveat emptor, but I feel that calling these headphones is intentionally misleading.Sennheiser makes a great pair of true, closed, headphones of comparable quality and style called the HD 280 Pro. For office listening, they're an excellent choice, and my co-workers agree."
3,Very Disappointed,"Well I bought these thinking they would be fantastic, got them in the mail and then tested them out and found for the price that the sound quality was not that good. I thought it was going to be similar to the Beats By Dr Dre since the normal price on these is near or over the full price of said headphones. It blocks no sound out at all. I know they are not noise canceling but dang it was like you could hear everything still which is good in some respects but worse in most. It was very comfortable to wear but I'm paying for sound not a head couch. So all in all I would say don't buy these because the sound produced is not that great unless perhaps these are the best you've heard then perhaps you need to test out some other ones cause these are not even close to some comparable and even cheaper headphones I have tried and that's just terrible! So don;t buy them really, plus they're from 2004 also which six years old in tech is olddddd."
3,Overrated,This headset would be perfect if it stayed in place but it slides down and I dropped it on the floor and the side broke......I duct taped it and I am still using it. Sound quality is excellent but due to the comfort issue I would not buy this one again. I still use it to do final mixes in my studio due to the sound quality but the next one I get will be a different headset.
3,They sound good but. . . .,"The build quality leaves a LOT to be desired. I've had a pair of Sony MDR-V900s for about four years now and I was tired of carrying them back and forth to work so I decided to get a second pair of headphones. I read the reviews on the HG-595s and thought they would be a good choice (and for the money I'd hoped they'd be even better than the Sony headphones). The 595s are pretty much just plastic and vinyl while the Sonys are plastic, metal, and leather. The 595s have a long non-coiled cord that you will be tripping on constantly while the Sonys have a nice high-quality coiled cord. The jack on the Sonys is all metal with a high quality screw-on adapter while the 595's is a cheap plastic molded piece like you'd find on a pair of ten-dollar headphones. In hind site I'd much rather have gone with a second set of the MDR-V900 (which you can find here on Amazon for $125)."
5,Quality Headphones,"Great sound! These headphones ROCK! After watching Battlefield: LA, I felt like I was literally there! Music comes through clean especially binaural and classical!"
4,I-pod Friendly and Travel Worthy?????,I love these headphones but so did the guy sitting next to me and the other person sitting next to him. These cans have supberb sound. I originally purchased these under the following criteria: it must sound good for my i-pod and be travel worthy. Unfortunatey these headphones generate sound outwards; to a level that someone sitting coach is going to give you the evil eye. These phones are very comfortable and again sound great. I would suggest using thess if you have something with more power than an ipod to enjoy. Best use would be for home or work; not travel.
5,HD 595 Sounds Marvellous,"This is a very quick--and early--review. (I took them out of the box 1/2 hour ago.) The sound is clear as a bell, the soundstage where it should be, the bass perfectly natural. Listen to a well-recorded version of some of the French impressionist composers, such as Ravel and Debussy. You'll be entranced by the ""feel"" of the sound."
3,Alright game.,I love the lion king and timon and pumba. But this game could have been better. I love the sling shot game and pinball. But the hippo hop and the burper game are not the greatest. Its an alright game and its fun to play when you're bored. But i wouldnt pay more then $5 for it.
4,Busia brings out the beauty of human nature...,"I have never read a book like this one before. The story's many twists make for a provocative and fascinating plot. I was completely entranced at times - feeling the pain, the sadness, and the joy of the characters. What a beautiful story and exploration of human emotion! If someone was to base a movie on the novel, I doubt that it would ever come close to capturing the charisma that the book does."
3,bit heavy,"I got these headphones to finally have a set that my cat doesn't destroy, he loves eating headphone cables...The sound quality is nice and the range is very good too. I do must have some sort of disturbance in my house as I get static depending on where I sit. If I go outside with them with the receiver inside the house they work great.I only gave 3 stars as I find them a bit too heavy and tight on top of the head. I have to say my scalp is freakishly sensitive but I do think one could make these lighter altogether."
2,Loved them until they stopped working,These were exactly what I was looking for - I could hear the TV while I rowed or went into another room. They were comfortable although they are big and they are quite light. The charge lasted a while too.But! I am very sorry to say that the left ear went out just 3 months after I bought them and they are just too expensive to be a throwaway item.
3,works ok...but....,The Sennheiser RS 120 has good audio quality and the range is fine. This wireless phone works as advertised.The only complaint is that they are not too comfortable to wear. There is pressure on one's ears and I have to readjust them every 10 minutes or so. The swivel earpieces do not seem to be well-designed and do not adapt (at least to me) to the coutours of my head.
5,sennheiser wireless headphones,Excellent quality of sound. Easy to set up. Easy to use. We bought the headphones to solve the problem of different hearing capabilities in one home - the headphones have made it possible for different people to watch TV with different sound levels.
5,Very happy and impressed,"I am totally happy with these headphones and unlike some of the other reviews, I do not hear hissing sounds and the other night I literally walked ouside my home and about 100 yards up the driveway and could still hear the tv loud and clear (and the set is located at the back of the building - not the front where I was putting out the garbage). If there is one downside, I have found that the headset is a little too large for me and if I lean forward they fall off my head. Otherwise, I couldn't be happier. I was thinking of getting another pair of cheaper ones for my bedroom television, but with all of the negative reviews on some of those items, I will purchase another set of these.I am deaf in one ear and would have to put the tv up so loud that is was very disruptive for my husband. Now, I can even put the TV on mute, put the garbage out and never miss a word. What a god-send."
2,"The slide off you head to easy, and you ear gets hot after a short time","they slide off you head to easy and your ear gets hot after a short time, the don't fit snog need more adjustment room"
1,Lasted less than a year,"Got this headset for my wife so she could be more mobile & still listen to the TV while our baby is sleeping. Works great, she loves them but I see a few flaws. (1) they slide off your head really easy if you learn forward (2) the wireless signal control is located right next to the volume control which means almost every time i've gone to change the volume i end up changing the wireless signal control, which is annoying. (3) there are only 3 radio stations on the signal mount/emitter, why does the headset need a dial for only 3 station options?UP DATE:The headphones stopped working less than a year from purchase. Not sure what the problem is, only used them infrequently and then one day... nothing. Would not purchase again."
2,Loses signal when connected to a TV,"Headphones have a pretty bad receiption, I am about 10 feet from my TV and they still hiss. Also, the headphones constantly get disconnected; for some reason they don't recognize that the sound is coming off the TV. I own a different set of Sennheisers that I had for about 5 years (they cost about $200), which work fine. Skip the cheap version, go for the higher quality model."
5,Headphones,We are very satisfied with the Sennheiser wireless head phones. They're great for listening to shows that have too much background music for the dialogue to come through clearly (especially to older listeners). We realized they also offer the option of moving around the room and even the whole house without missing parts of the program. My husband can also listen to his favorite CD's from his workshop.
2,Disappointed,"Initially, I was very pleased with the headphones, using them primarily for playing Skyrim. The background ""hiss"" mentioned by others is pretty noticeable, but I could live with it since the headphones sounded good otherwise and were quite comfortable. The deal-killer was the auto-shutoff feature. At least once an hour, the headphones would shut off when the sound level in the game was quiet, causing an almost painful burst of static noise that continued until the computer audio cable was disconnected and reconnected. It's unfortunate the feature can't be disabled. I ended up returning them."
4,"Very good sound, but doesn't work with any TV","Before buy these Headphones check if your TV has a mini jack headphones Output or a Stereo Analog Output.My TV (37'' Vizio 1080p) just has an Digital Audio Output, so I had to buy a Converter Box:FiiO D3 Digital to Analog Audio Converter With Micca 6ft Optical Toslink Cable - 192kHz/24bit Optical and Coaxial DAC(this one came with the cable)Now works perfect, good sound and reception."
5,"Clear, no buzz sound","Great product. Has clear, no buzz or hum sound, even at low volumes. Very good stereo effects. Very good value."
4,Works great,"I have used these headphones exclusively to watch TV and play video games while my son is sleeping. The headphones work great, and allow me complete freedom of movement, versus the long headphone extension cable I used to use. The first time I used them, it took a couple of minutes to select just the right frequency for minimum noise, but I haven't had to play with the settings since. My only gripe would be the automatic volume adjustment feature that can't be turned off. When I play video games or watch DVDs, whenever I hit a menu or some other section with no sound, the headphones try to compensate by increasing the gain, which results in a buzzing sound. It's a minor irritation, and the buzzing immediately goes away when the source sound returns, but I wish I could turn off this feature."
4,Sennheiser RS120 Wireless Headphones,These headphones were comfortable for extended use. They were easy to install and they provided decent sound quality and volume considering they were wireless. Definitely served the purpose providing acceptable sound reproduction for a senior citizen with hearing problems making television watching more enjoyable.
4,blown away....,These headphones are all they say they are. Great sound and no static due to the awesome easy tuning. I use them while I'm on the treadmill and they tend to slip a bit. The range is exceptionally good and they receive well through walls.I wore them outside to the mailbox which is over 100 feet from the house and they still had great sound. The reason I gave it only 4 stars is that the tuning and volume dials are so close together. I guess it's just a matter of getting use to. Other than that it is well worth the purchase.
1,Poor Fit / Adjustibility,They constantly fall off of my head! I tried them on other people with the same result.When I manage to keep them on my head (sit still and keep head perfectly level) they perform reasonably well.....Uncomfortable after 20-30 minutes as they are bulky and quite heavy.
1,Don't work!!,"I ordered this set of Sennheiser RS120 Wireless headphones to use in my new addition sun room. I tried them out when they came in just to see if they did, in fact, work. They did, but with some minor background hissing and popping noise.Just now when into my new sun room to watch a movie so not to disturb my wife. Nothing BUT hissing and popping sounds came from this headset!! So I used them for about 1 hour when they first arrived and for the second time I've had them on my head, NOTHING!! And yes, I did try to tune them by changing the setting on both the base and earphone, without any success!!The return window expired in October!!That'll learn me!! Maybe they'll make a good paper weight?? Sure not good for anything else!!Just get some long wires and plug in the 'Skull-Candies'!! ALOT cheaper, too!!Did I mention that these set on top of (outside)your ears and won't stay on your head if you look down??? Not well designed at all."
